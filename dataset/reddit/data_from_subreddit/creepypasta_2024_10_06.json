We've been largely hands-off, letting people decide with upvotes and downvotes as opposed to micro-managing.\n\nAdditionally, we didn't want to send users to subreddits owned and run by other teams because - to be honest - we can't vouch for others, and whether or not they would treat users well and allow you guys to post all the things you post here. (In other words, we don't always agree with the strictness or tone of some other subreddits, and didn't want to make you guys go to those, instead.)\n\nTo that end, we've come up with a solution of sorts.\n\nWe started r\/IconPasta long ago, for fandom-related posts about Jeff the Killer, BEN, Ticci Toby, and the rest.\n\nWe started r\/HorrorNarrations as well, for narrators to have a specific place that was \"just for them\" without being drowned out by a thousand other types of posts.\n\nSo, now, we're announcing r\/EyeScream for creepy, disturbing, and just plain \"weird\" images!\n\nAt r\/EyeScream, you can count on us to be just as hands-off, only interfering with posts when they break Reddit ToS or our very light rules. (No Gore, No Porn, etc.)\n\nWe hope you guys have fun being the first users there - this is your opportunity to help build and influence what r\/EyeScream is, and will become, for years to come!"},"2":{"title":"Someone please let me know","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwzj2u\/someone_please_let_me_know\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"TikToK-brought-me","selftext":"Is it weird that when I was around 11-13 I had an obsession with creepypastas. \n\nLike I'm being serious when I say obsession.\n\nMy mam used to take me and my siblings for late night walks and if we just so happened to be walking through a forest then I'd walk a bit ahead of everyone and start shouting \"slender man\" the whole way..

I scratched my hair and groggily got up from the mess of blankets on the floor.\nOther people lied asleep from yesterday’s party, food and drinks scattered haphazardly.\nRed rays of sunlight peeking from the blinds, assaulting my eyes.\nStepping over people I made my way to close them.\nMe being the dumbfuck I am, I pressed the wrong button. The blinds shot open.\nRed light fully lit the room, my eyes burnt as I stared directly at the small red fireball rising from the horizon.\n\nI covered my eyes, falling to my knees and cursed out. The other people around me awaking.\n\n“Christ Brandon…. Cl- close the blinds…”\nClementine groaned, pulling a blanket over her face.\n\nRaising my head to press the right button, I caught sight of the sun again. It was red.\n\n“Why, wh- WHY THE HELL IS THE SUN RED!”\nI shouted out\n\n“What are you talking about man?”\nXavier spoke, getting up from the couch.\n\nI pointed out the window\n“THE SUN IS RED, ITS SMALL, WHAT TH-“\nI stopped. Looking outside again I saw the red plant life sprawling everywhere.\nThe ocean in the distance being impossibly light blue, the trees long and thin. Everything outside was so… alien. Oh…\n\nXavier pressed a button, the blinds closed.\nHe placed his hand on my shoulder and sighed. Squinting at me in dissatisfaction.\n“We’re not on earth anymore, dummy. How much did you drink last night?”\n\nIt all started to come back to me, my memories returning from my drunken state. My hangover felt as if washed away once I remembered.\n\n“First day of phase 2: human colonization process”\nI blurted out as if the phrase was hard wired into my brain.\n\n“Yea, yippee”\nXavier said, turning away to the kitchen of our shared crew compartment.\n\n“GOOD MORNING ALL PIONEERS! I’m sure last night's celebration activities were a blast! However there is great work to be done. Ensure to drink sobering drugs and attend to your managers for your jobs. Remember! Humanity's survival depends on it!”\nA cheery voice blasted through the intercom system.\n\nI walked out of line, downing the sober medicine provided by the food dispenser.\nPeople excitedly chatted to one another while eating. Everyone wearing the same uniforms with colored shoulder strips signifying their occupation.\nMine was a yellow and black, heavy machine operator.\n\n“Yo Brandon!”\nA voice called out to me\nMy friend, Clementine sat, raising her arm up.\nNext to her being Simon and Xavier, my other two friends.\n\nWalking over I joined them to eat.\n\n“Way to start the morning, huh? Xavier told me what happened”\nSimon jokingly said, taking a bite from a high nutrition bar.\n\n“Yea, he forgot we’re on some other planet a smectillion billion trillion light years from earth!”\nXavier spoke out, pointing at me mockingly\n\n“Actually we’re only 214 million light years from earth, planet name python-18, 4th from red dwarf star specifically”\nSimon stated\n\nXavier frowned at him and sighed\n“Yea, whatever four eyes”\n\n“Xavier, shut it, you’re a janitorial staff. You clean fecal matter”\nClementine said jokingly\n\n“Yea! Well shit disposal was a very important job for Seed Of Man, and it’ll be a very important job here!”\nXavier shot back.\n\n“But fecal matter was to be used for fertilizer. You did turn it over to vegetation personnel did you?”\nSimon asked\n\n“Yea yea I did! Can we stop talking about shit now? It’s getting oddly weird how much we’re going into detail about this.”\nXavier shuttered\n\n“He’s right, plus I’m glad we’re finally on the ground again. How do you guys think home is doing right now?”\nI said trying to change the topic\n\n“Stupid politics, communism hopefully not spreading too much in the past 4 weeks we’ve been gone, and waiting to get back to my immortal dog thanks to science”\nClementine exclaimed\n\n“See, that’s normal to talk about, let’s continue”\n\n“Well I heard the drilling operations are starting off… bad.”\nSimon spoke\n\n“Oh, so we can’t drill for oil here? How horrible, how will we eve-“\nI was cut off as my left arm began to vibrate, I looked down at my SITA to see an incoming message.\n\n“Brandon Jones: attend space elevator immediately for operation”\nThe message read\n\nTurning up to tell my friends, I saw that they all were looking down at their SITAs too\n\n“You all got the same message?”\nI asked \n\n“I mean we got jobs here, you and I are the mighty large elevator operators after all.”\nClementine jokingly said.\n\n“Oh crap, can I go with you guys? I always wanted to ride one of those!”\nXavier excitedly asked\n\nI grinned sinisterly at him\n“Sure pal, need someone to fix the toilet there”\n\nXavier flipped me off and groaned\n“Seriously unbelievable, unfunny, and stupid attempt at humor... Thanks though”\n\nWe all got up to attend to our work, everyone else around us did the same.\n\nThe cargo bay was loud, large crates full of equipment being transported by small cranes.\nWorkers unloaded machines from the crates and moved them through the train system built in the facility.\n\nA man with a red stripe on his arm approached us. A manager.\n“You all here for that shipment? Supposed to be some “sensitive” equipment from the Seed Of Man”\nThe manger stopped, looking at Xavier confusingly and looking back down at his SITA\n\n“What’s he doing here? He isn’t on the list for elevator operators”\nThe manager asked \n\n“We needed an extra hand and everyone else had an occupation they were working on. Thought it would be wise to bring him along with us”\nSimon said, pointing at his own red stripe\n\n“Well ok, but if anything goes wrong it’s on you. This is some “important stuff” they’re saying”\nThe manager responded sternly\n\nWe made our way in front of the large elevator doors.\nThey opened slowly revealing a large space for cargo, multiple seats, and an operating room for Clementine and I.\n\n“Alright, let’s operate some heavy machinery!”\nClementine confidently said, patting me on the back and walking inside.\n\n“And I called you unfunny”\nXavier whispered to me walking inside and sitting down.\n\nThe outer doors closed, then the inner ones. Clementine and I sat at the operation panel, ensuring pressure inside wouldn’t blend us while traveling to and from low planetary orbit.\nThe intercom crackled to life\n\n“Operators, confirm status”\n\n“Status: operational and ready. Awaiting confirmation from ground personnel.\nI spoke\n\n“Confirmation approved, godspeed and safe trip”\nThe voice responded\n\nThe elevator vibrated for a bit before immediately shooting up at extreme speeds.\nIn seconds clementine and I could see the entire facility and surrounding area from the small window ahead of us.\nWe sped past the clouds and began to slow down, a large object above coming into view as we reached low orbit.\n\n1,400 miles long, 500 miles wide. The Seed Of Man orbited above the colony, above us. The greatest achievement by man populated by millions.\n\nThe elevator came to a stop. We had reached the small space station.\nThe inner and outer doors opened, forklifts entered and dropped off heavy duty metal crates.\n\n“SELF SUFFICIENT NUCLEAR FISSION”\n\nThe bold words caught my attention, men wearing hazmat gear ensured the crates were properly secured before leaving\n\nA manager walked in and inspected the restraints while checking his SITA before walking out\n“ALL GOOD, RETURN WHEN READY”\nHe shouted out at us\n\nThe doors shut again, Clementine and I began ensuring the pressure or whatever was safe for our return trip.\nWe began to descend.\n\nThe intercom crackled to life half way down.\n“Good work, that cargo ensures enough power for the whole planet! We’ll be conc-“\nThe man on the other end went silent\n“Hey uhh, Tony. You good? Your-“\nThe man was cut off, A loud boom rang from their side of the intercom.\n\n“WHAT THE FUCK, Christ, TONY WHAT DID YO-“\nThe man behind the intercom began screaming, \n\nour elevator shook violently, sparks flying and the sound of metal scraping pierced my ears.\nMore screams erupted in the background before cutting out. \nOur elevator suddenly came to an unsafe halt, my head slammed onto the operation panel. Everything went dark.\n\n“Brandon… Brandon!”\nClementine's voice awoke me, blood dripped from my nose, my SITA signifying minor blood injuries.\n\n“Wh… what happened?”\nI groaned\n\n“I don’t know! We got stuck? Accident from ground operators? It's been an hour!”\nClementine frantically yelled\n\nI tried to mess with the controls. Nothing.\nA voice blared out from the intercom\n“Ground crew, non responsive, life support systems, failing, initiating emergency return”\n\nThe elevator began to descend rapidly, the facility coming to view as we slowed down.\nThe doors opened.\n\nSimon got up from his seat and angrily marched out to the cargo bay\n“WHAT THE HELL GUYS! WHOS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS!”\nHe shouted out. No answer.\n\nQuickly I got up from my seat and got off the elevator.\nThe cargo bay, once loud, filled with people working, and moving machinery... Was completely devoid of life…\n\n“Guys…”\nClementines voice whimpered out\n\nTurning to her I could see she was pointing to the elevator operating room.\nThe window… was covered in blood.\n"},"7":{"title":"After my father died, I found a logbook concealed in his hospice room that he could not have written. (Post 1)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fx0vyj\/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"UnalloyedSaintTrina","selftext":"John Morrison was, and will always be, my north star. Naturally, the pain wrought by his ceaseless and incremental deterioration over the last five years at the hands of his Alzheimer’s dementia has been invariably devastating for my family. In addition to the raw agony of it all, and in keeping with the metaphor, the dimming of his light has often left me desperately lost and maddeningly aimless. With time, however, I found meaning through trying to live up to him and who he was. Chasing his memory has allowed me to harness that crushing pain for what it was and continues to be: a representation of what a monument of a man John Morrison truly was. If he wasn’t worth remembering, his erasure wouldn’t hurt nearly as much. \n\nA few weeks ago, John Morrison died. His death was the first and last mercy of his disease process. And while I feel some bittersweet relief that his fragmented consciousness can finally rest, I also find myself unnerved in equal measure. After his passing, I discovered a set of documents under the mattress of his hospice bed - some sort of journal, or maybe logbook is a better way to describe it. Even if you were to disclude the actual content of these documents, their very existence is a bit mystifying. First and foremost, my father has not been able to speak a meaningful sentence for at least six months - let alone write one. And yet, I find myself holding a series of articulately worded and precisely written journal entries, in his hand-writing with his very distinctive narrative voice intact no less. Upon first inspection, my explanation for these documents was that they were old, and that one of my other family members must have left it behind when they were visiting him one day - why they would have effectively hidden said documents under his mattress, I have no idea. But upon further evaluation, and to my absolute bewilderment, I found evidence that these documents *had absolutely* been written recently. We moved John into this particular hospice facility half a year ago, and one peculiar quirk of this institution is the way they approach providing meals for their dying patients. Every morning without fail at sunrise, the aides distribute menus detailing what is going to be available to eat throughout the day. I always found this a bit odd (people on death’s door aren’t known for their voracious appetite or distinct interest in a rotating set of meals prepared with the assistance of a few local grocery chains), but ultimately wholesome and humanizing. John Morrison had created this logbook, in delicate blue ink, on the back of these menus. \n\nHowever strange, I think I could reconcile and attribute finding incoherent scribbles on the back of looseleaf paper menus mysteriously sequestered under a mattress to the inane wonders of a rapidly crystallizing brain. Incoherent scribbles are not what I have sitting in a disorderly stack to the left of my laptop as I type this. \n\nI am making this post to immortalize the transcripts of John Morrison’s deathbed logbook. In doing so, I find myself ruminating on the point, and potential dangers, of doing so. I might be searching for some understanding, and then maybe the meaning, of it all. Morally, I think sharing what he recorded in the brief lucid moments before his inevitable curtain call may be exceptionally self-centered. But I am finding my morals to be suspended by the continuing, desperate search for guidance - a surrogate north star to fill the vacuum created by the untoward loss of a great man. Although I recognize my actions here may only serve to accelerate some looming cataclysm. \n\nFor these logs to make sense, I will need to provide a brief description of who John Morrison was. Socially, he was gentle and a bit soft spoken - despite his innate understanding of humor, which usually goes hand and hand with extroversion. Throughout my childhood, however, that introversion did evolve into overwhelming reclusiveness. I try not to hold it against him, as his monasticism was a byproduct of devotion to his work and his singular hobby. Broadly, he paid the bills with a science background and found meaning through art. More specifically - he was a cellular biologist and an amateur oil painter. I think he found his fullness through the juxtaposition of biology and art. He once told me that he felt that pursuing both disciplines with equal vigor would allow him to find “their common endpoint”, the elusive location where intellectualism and faith eventually merged and became indistinguishable from one and other. I think he felt like that was enlightenment, even if he never explicitly said so. \n\nIn his 9 to 5, he was a researcher at the cutting edge of what he described as “cellular topography”. Essentially, he was looking at characterizing the architecture of human cells at an extremely microscopic level. He would say - “looking at a cell under a normal microscope is like looking at a map of America, a top-down, big-picture view. I’m looking at the cell like I’m one person walking through a smalltown in Kansas. I’m recording and documenting the peaks, the valleys, the ponds - I’m mapping the minute landmarks that characterize the boundless infinity of life” I will not pretend to even remotely grasp the implications of that statement, and this in spite of the fact that I too pursued a biologic career, so I do have some background knowledge. I just don’t often observe cells at a “smalltown in Kansas” level as a hospital pediatrician. \n\nAs his life progressed, it was burgeoning dementia that sidelined him from his career. He retired at the very beginning of both the pandemic and my physician training. I missed the early stages of it all, but I heard from my sister that he cared about his retirement until he didn’t remember what his career was to begin with. She likened it to sitting outside in the waning heat of the summer sun as the day transitions from late afternoon to nightfall - slowly, almost imperceptibly, he was losing the warmth of his ambitions, until he couldn’t remember the feeling of warmth at all in the depth of this new night. \n\nHis fascination (and subsequent pathologic disinterest) with painting mirrored the same trajectory. Normally, if he was home and awake, he would be in his studio, developing a new piece. He had a variety of influences, but he always desired to unify the objective beauty of Claude Monet and the immaterial abstraction of Picasso. He was always one for marrying opposites, until his disease absconded with that as well. \n\nBecause of his merging of styles, his works were not necessarily beloved by the masses - they were a little too chaotic and unintelligible, I think. Not that he went out of his way to sell them, or even show them off. The only one I can visualize off the top of my head is a depiction of the oak tree in our backyard that he drew with realistic human vasculature visible and pulsing underneath the bark. At 8, this scared the shit out of me, and I could not tell you what point he was trying to make. Nor did he go out of his way to explain his point, not even as reparations for my slight arboreal traumatization. \n\nBut enough preamble - below, I will detail his first entry, or what I think is his first entry. I say this because although the entries are dated, none of the dates fall within the last 6 months. In fact, they span over two decades in total. I was hoping the back-facing menus would be date-stamped, as this would be an easy way to determine their narrative sequence, but unfortunately this was not the case. One evening, about a week after he died, I called and asked his case manager at the hospice if she could help determine which menu came out when, much to her immediate and obvious confusion (retrospectively, I can understand how this would be an odd question to pose *after* John died). I reluctantly shared my discovery of the logbook, for which she also had no explanation. What she could tell me is that none of his care team *ever* observed him writing anything down, nor do they like to have loose pens floating around their memory unit because they could pose a danger to their patients. \n\nJohn Morrison was known to journal throughout his life, though he was intensely private about his writing, and seemingly would dispose of his journals upon completion. I don’t recall exactly when he began journaling, but I have vivid memories of being shooed away when I did find him writing in his notebooks. In my adolescence, I resented him for this. But in the end, I’ve tried to let bygones be bygones. \n\nAs a small aside, he went out of his way to meticulously draw some tables\/figures, as, evidently, some vestigial scientific methodology hid away from the wildfire that was his dementia, only to re-emerge in the lead up to his death. I will scan and upload those pictures with the entries. I will have poured over all of the entries by the time I post this.  A lot has happened in the weeks since he’s passed, and I plan on including commentary to help contextualize the entries. It may take me some time. \n\nAs a final note: he included an image which can be found at this link ([https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Rb2VbHP](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Rb2VbHP)) before every entry, removed entirely from the other tables and figures. This arcane letterhead is copied *perfectly* between entries. And I mean perfect - they are all literally identical. Just like the unforeseen resurgence of John’s analytical mind, his dexterous hand also apparently intermittently reawakened during his time in hospice (despite the fact that when I visited him, I would be helping him dress, brush his teeth, etc.). I will let you all know ahead of time, that this tableau is the divine and horrible cornerstone, the transcendent and anathematized bedrock, the cursed fucking linchpin. As much as I want to emphasize its importance, I can’t effectively explain *why* it is so important at the moment. All I can say now is that I believe that John Morrison did find his “common endpoint”, and it may cost us everything. \n\nEntry 1:\n\nDated as April, 2004\n\n*First translocation.*\n\n*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM, Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.* \n\n*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children. Legos strewn across every surface with reckless abandon. Stains of unknown origin. I am grateful, of course, but good lord the absolute devastation.*  \n\n*I walked clandestinely down the stairs, avoiding perceived creaking floorboards as if they were landmines, hoping to sneak out the front door and get a deep breath of fresh air prior to joining my wife in the kitchen. Unfortunately, Lucy had been gifted with incredible spatial awareness. With a single aberrant footstep, a whisper of a creaking floorboard betrayed me, and I felt Lucy peer sharp daggers into me. Her echolocation, as always, was unparalleled.* \n\n*“Oh look - Dad’s awake!” Lucy proclaimed with a smirk. She had doomed me with less than five words. I heard Lily and Peter dropping silverware in an excited frenzy.* \n\n*“Touche, love.” I replied with resignation. I hugged each of them good morning as they came barreling towards me and returned them to the syrup-ridden battlefield that was our kitchen table.*\n\n*Peter was 6. Bleach blonde hair, a swath of freckles covering the bridge of his nose. He’s a kind, introspective soul I think. A revolving door of atypical childhood interests though. Ghosts and mini golf as of late.*\n\n*Lily, on the other hand, was 3. A complete and utter contrast to Peter, which we initially welcomed with open arms. Gregarious and frenetic, already showing interest in sports - not things my son found value in. The only difference we did not treasure was her health - Peter was perfectly healthy, but Lily was found to have a kidney tumor that needed to be surgically excised a year ago, along with her kidney.* \n\n*Lucy, as always, stood slender and radiant in the morning light, attending to some dishes over the sink. We met when we were both 18 and had grown up together. When I remembered to, I let her know that she was my kaleidoscope - looking through her, the bleak world had beauty, and maybe even meaning if I looked long enough.* \n\n*After setting the kids at the table, I helped her with the dishes, and we talked a bit about work. I had taken the position at CellCept two weeks ago. The hours were grueling, but the pay was triple what I was earning at my previous job. Lily’s chemotherapy was more important than my sanity. Lucy and I had both agreed on this fact with a half shit-eating, half earnest grin on the day I signed my contract. Thankfully, I had been scouted alongside a colleague, Majorie.* \n\n*Majorie was 15 years my junior, a true savant when it came to cellular biology. It was an honor to work alongside her, even on the days it made me question my own validity as a scientist. Perhaps more importantly though, Lucy and her were close friends. Lucy and I discussed the transition, finances, and other topics quietly for a few minutes, until she said something that gave me pause.* \n\n*“How are you feeling? Beyond the exhaustion, I mean”* \n\n*I set the plate I was scrubbing down, trying to determine exactly what she was getting at.*\n\n*“I’m okay. Hanging in best I can”*\n\n*She scrunched her nose to that response, an immediate and damning physiologic indicator that I had not given her an answer that was close enough to what she was fishing for.* \n\n*“You sure you’re doing OK?”*\n\n*“Yeah, I am” I replied.* \n\n*She put her head down. In conjunction with the scrunched nose, I could tell her frustration was rising.*\n\n*“John - you just started a new medication, and the seizure wasn’t that long ago. I know you want to be stoic and all that but…”*\n\n*I turned to her, incredulous. I had never had a seizure before in my life. I take a few Tylenol here and there, but otherwise I wasn’t on any medication.* \n\n*“Lucy, what are you talking about?” I said. She kept her head down. No response.* \n\n*“Lucy?” I put a hand on her shoulder. This is where I think the translocation starts, or maybe a few seconds ago when she asked about the seizure. In a fleeting moment, all the ambient noise evaporated from our kitchen. I could no longer hear the kids babbling, the water splashing off dishes, the birds singing distantly outside the kitchen window. As the word “Lucy” fell out of my mouth, it unnaturally filled all of that empty space. I practically startled myself, it felt like I had essentially shouted in my own ear.* \n\n*Lucy, and the kids, were caught and fixed in a single motion. Statuesque and uncanny. Lucy with her head down at the sink. Lily sitting up straight and gazing outside the window with curiosity. Peter was the only one turned towards me, both hands on the edge of his chair with his torso tilted forward, suspended in the animation of getting up from the kitchen table. As I stepped towards Lucy, I noticed that Peter’s eyes would follow my position in the room. Unblinking. No movement from any other part of his body to accompany his eyes tracking me.*\n\n*Then, at some point, I noticed a change in my peripheral vision to the right of where I was standing. The blackness may have just blinked into existence, or it may have crept in slowly as I was preoccupied with the silence and my newly catatonic family. I turned cautiously, something primal in me trying to avoid greeting the waiting abyss. Where my living room used to stand, there now stood an empty room bathed in fluorescent light from an unclear source, sickly yellow rays reflecting off of an alien tile floor. There were no walls to this room. At a certain point, the tile flooring transitioned into inky darkness in every direction. In the middle of the room, there was a man on a bench, watching me turn towards him.* \n\n*With my vision enveloped by these new, stygian surroundings, a cacophonous deluge of sound returned to me. Every plausible sound ever experienced by humanity, present and accounted for - laughing, crying, screaming, shouting. Machines and music and nature. An insurmountable and uninterruptible wave of force. At the threshold of my insanity, the man in the center stepped up from the bench. He was holding both arms out, palms faced upwards. His skin was taught and tented on both of his wrists, tired flesh rising about a foot symmetrically above each hand. Dried blood streaks led up to a center point of the stretched skin, where a fountain of mercurial silver erupted upwards. Following the silver with my eyes, I could see it divided into thousands of threads, each with slightly different angular trajectories, all moving heavenbound into the void that replaced my living room ceiling. With the small motion of bringing both of his hands slightly forward and towards me, the cacophony ceased in an instant.* \n\n*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. His face, however, devoured my attention. The skin of his face was a deep red consistent with physical strain, glistening with sweat. He wore a tiny smile - the sides of his lips barely rising up to make a smile recognizable. His unblinking eyes, however, were unbearably discordant with that smile. In my life, I have seen extremes of both physical and mental pain. I have seen the eyes of someone who splintered their femur in a hiking accident, bulging with agony. I have seen the eyes of a mother whose child was stillborn, wild with melancholy. The pain, the absolute oblivion, in this figure’s eyes easily surpassed the existential discomfort of both of those memories. And with those eyes squarely fixated on my own, I found myself somewhere else.* \n\n*My consciousness returned to its set point in a hospital bed. There was a young man beside me, holding my hand. Couldn’t have been more than 14. I retracted my hand out of his grip with significant force. The boy slid back in his chair, clearly startled by my sudden movement. Before I could ask him what was going on, Lucy jogged into the room, her work stilettos clacking on the wooden floor. I pleaded with her to get this stranger out of here, to explain what was happening, to give me something concrete to anchor myself to.* \n\n*With a sense of urgency, Lucy said: “Peter honey, could you go get your uncle from the waiting room and give your father and I a moment?”* \n\n*The hospital’s neurologist explained that I suffered a grand mal seizure while at home. She also explained that all of the testing, so far, did not show an obvious reason for the seizure, like a tumor or stroke. More testing to come, but she was hopeful nothing serious was going on. We talked about the visions I had experienced, which she chalked up to an atypical “aura”, or a sudden and unusual sensation that can sometimes precede a seizure.* \n\n*Lucy and I spoke for a few minutes while Peter retrieved his uncle. As she recounted our lives (home address, current work struggles, etc.) I slowly found memories of Lily’s 8th birthday party, Peter’s first day of middle school, Lucy and I taking a trip to Bermuda to celebrate my promotion at CellCept. When Peter returned with his uncle, I thankfully did recognize him as my son.*\n\n*Initially, I was satisfied with the explanation given to me for my visions. Additionally, confusion and disorientation after seizures is a common phenomenon, known as a “post-ictal” state. It all gave me hope. That false hope endured only until my next translocation, prompting me to document my experiences.*  \n\nEnd of entry 1 \n\nJohn was actually a year off - I was 15 when he had his first seizure. Date-wise he is correct, though: he first received his late onset epilepsy diagnosis in April of 2004, right after my mother’s birthday that year. The memory he is initially recalled, if it is real, would have happened in 1995.\n\nI apologize, but I am exhausted, and will need to stop transcription here for now.

The stories of the misfortunes that befell sailors who crossed paths with Davy Jones had always circulated through the taverns, carried by hushed whispers beneath the flickering lamp light, but there I was, a mere boy caught up in the excitement of a life at sea. Adventure called to me, and the unknown held an allure I couldn't resist.\n\nOur journey began innocuously enough, the sun glistening off the surface of the waves, the air crisp with the salt of the ocean. The crew was a motley bunch, their faces hardened by the sun and the sting of salt water. They were men rougher than the sea itself, but they raised their mugs to me, a fresh-faced lad with dreams as vast as the ocean, and I felt the warmth of camaraderie envelop me. However, by nightfall, I began to notice a shift.\n\nA tempest rolled in as we sailed deeper into the heart of the Caribbean. The dark clouds whipped together like sinister hands in the sky, and I could hear the men cursing under their breath, exchanging glances that spoke of unnameable fears. I held fast to the rail, feeling the ship sway as the wind howled around us. That’s when the figure appeared.\n\nFrom the shadows of the navigating deck, a tall silhouette emerged. He was cloaked in rags that billowed like the sails above us, his face obscured by darkness, save for the faint glimmer of cursed gold that adorned his skeletal wrist. My heart raced, not from fear but from the intoxicating thrill of the unknown. I was drawn to him, like a moth to a flame.\n\n“Boy,” he rasped, the sound like gravel being crushed beneath heavy boots. “Do you know what lies beneath the waves?”\n\nI felt the breath leave my lungs, and from deep within, a whisper—soft, sinister—began to gnaw at the edges of my sanity. He stepped closer, illuminated by the distant lightning, and I caught a glimpse of his true form. His eyes were empty voids, a darkness so profound it seemed to draw in light. Around us, the storm intensified, as if brewing in accordance with his presence.\n\n“Davy Jones does not abide the unworthy,” he continued, his voice a soft hiss that climbed over the screeching wind. “He waits for those who dare to defy the sea. Will you bargain with him?”\n\nMy throat dried as dread pooled in my stomach. It wasn’t mere superstition that tremored through the crew. The trappings of old folklore rang in their hearts—the stories of men dragged to Davy Jones' Locker, their souls forever ensnared by the wretched curse of the sea. Somehow, the crew sensed what I had not—I was naive to the dangers lurking beneath the dark, roiling waves.\n\nAs the storm raged, the ship fought valiantly against the fury of the ocean. Men scrambled to secure the sails while I remained rooted to the spot where that figure had vanished, captivated by the impossible allure of the ocean's darkness. I could hear the whispers of long-lost souls mingling with the wind, the chorus of the damned, singing of their eternal suffering.\n\nDays passed in our turmoil, the storm never quite breaking, and shadows flickered in the corners of my vision. I would often find myself alone, pacing the ship, staring out into the vast nothingness where the horizon blurred into an abyss. It was during one such moment that I came across a wooden box, hidden beneath the floorboards of the captain’s quarters. With trembling hands, I pried it open.\n\nInside lay a collection of trinkets and treasures—pieces of gold, necklaces, and charms—a trove to make a sailor mad with desire. But it was the charm of a deep blue gem that captivated me most; it shimmered with an otherworldly luminescence, and with it, I felt power radiating from my fingertips. My heart raced; I was being pulled deeper into a world from which I could never return.\n\nThat night, the air was thick with dread as I grasped the gem in my palm. The dark figure returned, swirling in and out of focus, like a living shadow. “You are marked now,” he breathed, his gaze boring into me. “You sought treasures, and he will come for you. Offer an escape… or be forever bound to the depths.”\n\nPanic gripped my heart as the truth unfurled before me. The more I clung to that vile piece of treasure, the more distance I created between myself and my crew. I could hear their laughter fade to silence, their faces twisted in horror as they whispered my name, a name soon to be woven into the tales of dread birthed from the depths of the ocean.\n\nThe storm intensified—waves crashing against the ship like furious hands, grasping for our vessel. Davy himself would come for me, a harbinger of my fate. The ship creaked beneath the pressure, and the crew was consumed by an eerie hush. I staggered under the weight of my choices, heart thudding like a drum signaling my demise.\n\nThen, out of the darkness, a voice pulsed through the tempest. “Your soul or the others—choose!” It resonated through the cold air, a terrifying proposition, and I realized then that the gem was a tether, not just to the treasure, but to my doom. With a cry, I hurled it into the tempestuous sea, watching as it glittered, swallowed by the depths.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe water surged, and the ship tilted, caught in a whirlpool of chaos. Screams erupted from the crew—a cacophony of terror—as the maw of the ocean opened wide, revealing the cursed world beneath. I was plunged into darkness, drowning in a sea of despair.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was not myself. Each breath tasted of salt and misery, my body forever changed, twisted into a mockery of humanity. I could see the ship, now consumed by the depths, along with the crew, their faces contorted in eternal horror.\n\nNow, I wander the abyss, for I have become a part of Davy Jones’ Locker, cursed to guide the souls of the unwary. I watch as ships sail above, men blissfully ignorant of the darkness that lurks below, and I am filled with an insatiable dread—as I whisper the names of the lost to the depths of the sea.\n\nBeware the tales of Davy Jones, for they may soon lead you to my realm. When you hear the ocean sing, remember the cursed treasure—the gem in the darkness. You don’t just lose your life when you seek the depths; you lose your very soul, forever entwined in the melancholy grip of the ocean’s embrace. If you ever find yourself standing at the edge of destiny, just remember…I’m watching…waiting…with hungry eyes beneath the waves."},"11":{"title":"the skydiver ghost","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwuh1a\/the_skydiver_ghost\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"imJacket","selftext":"I went skydiving in Okinawa last year with 2 friends, i was very nervous but went anyways because it would be a cool story to tell, little did i knew that it would be much more than that..\n\nWe hopped on the plane, and started ascending. When we reached the right altitude, my heart dropped, my body tensed up, my eyes glazed. We were flying over an island, that was our land zone, but my brain couldn't stop thinking of all the things that could go wrong. What if my parachute didn't open? What if i landed in the middle of the ocean... the light went green, it was now or never and i had to do it, i couldn't pass on this opportunity...\n\nWithout thinking, i jumped. My heart started beating faster than ever, my eyes blurry. The wind was strong whipping my hair around, or perhaps i had just reached terminal velocity, but then out of nowhere, a strange man who wasn't on the plane with us descended to my level and stopped in front of me. He didnt have any goggles, was wearing a yellow suit, his hair... IMPECCABLY combed back, unbothered by the wind. Looking at me, he gave me a thumbs up, and smiled like no one before. My heart finally started to rest and my eyes sharpened, and now i could see.. it was beautiful, the skies were blue, as blue as the water bellow. Some white clouds in the distance gave me an ethereal feeling. All my life's decisions, all my accomplishments, all my failures, it all culminated into this very moment. \n\nHe reached for his backpack, which seemed to lack any parachute, pulled out a vinyl album and handed it to me. I grabbed it and looked at it, \"Masayoshi Takanaka - All Of Me\" was written in the corner, and the cover.. it was him, it was the sky and the water, it was as if what i was seeing had been etched on the album cover. When i looked in front of me again, he was gone, vanished as if he was a ghost. Maybe he was, but the feeling remained. I was at peace.\n\nEvery time I feel down now, i think back to him, his smile and all the blue behind him, I play the album, and my heart rests."},"12":{"title":"Pasce in nomine eius et Laetare","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fx35pb\/pasce_in_nomine_eius_et_laetare\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"yfghtdfhufv","selftext":"Feed in his name and rejoice. \n\nThat's at least what google translate said that phrase was when I looked it up after the compound I had discovered today. The one I had escaped from. In order to share my findings, in hopes that someone saves this before it gets taken down, I am posting here. For everyone who knows me and have been worried sick about my disappearance I suggest forgetting about me and expose the greater truth. \n\nYesterday, I had gotten a new case. One that was really unsurprising. As a PI I had gotten used to the worst side of humanity. Theft, Murder, Domestic Abuse, Child Abuse, Sexual Abuse, etc. I even worked on a missing persons case that was a victim to Richard Ramirez when I lived in California. This case seemed tamer than others I had worked on in the past. A woman's homeless brother had gone missing.\n\nShe said, and I quote, \"I couldn't find his new address since he switched bridges\". Apparently, the homeless had their own sort of address system so when they got drugs or dealt drugs, they would say an address only they would know. To keep cops confused when listening through a rat. She continued to say that the bridge he was staying at was 8th Under, and she had already checked 3rd and 5th. \n\nI asked the simple questions. Was he doing drugs, involved with a gang, want to lose contact with you for any reason. None of that she said. \"He's a good guy who just went bankrupt after his business failed. I offered him a room, but he wouldn't take it.\" She gave me more information, nothing worthy to discuss, and I started looking into his background. He was interesting. \n\nTop of his class, in high school at least, he never went into college and instead he tried his hand at entrepreneurship. A window cleaning service, bakery, paper manufacturing, and even an old folks home just to name a few. Hiring his \"skill\" as it went on with no success. It ended with a startup hospital went put him out for good. He had been homeless for only three months with most of his time spent at 8th Under. I had gone to 8th Under before because another homeless person went missing two months ago. \n\nAs I drove through town with the mostly smog covered sky above me, I went again to 8th Under and a beggar who I had spoken to last time was still there. Ragged clothes for the winter, empty bottles sprawled along the ground in remnant of his indulgence, and a shopping cart filled with trash. The bridge was barley standing, time has caused it to become unstable but with lack of funding no one has repaired it. \"Any change for a poor soul sir?\" I gave him a dollar, and he raised his head. \"Why sir it's you, I remember you!\" He spoke with gravel in his throat but as angelic and proud as a preacher. \"Why are you here?\" \n\n\"Another missing person Rico.\"\n\n\"So? People go missing every day. Just as people die every day. Just as the sun rises and falls every day. And just as people who find their place are labeled as lost.\" I pondered the last sentence and grabbed a photo of the brother to show him. \"That photo won't do no good. He had already transcended. The transformation started and now has passed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" At this question, he laughed softly and began to rant. Whether it was alcohol or the truth I still don't know. Even with the events that have occurred, I feel like only half of what he said had any significance. \n\n\"I mean to be a bridge, like this one, but instead of cars I mean to pass a spark of ignition to the mind. I mean to decide the start and end. I mean to ferry those who ask, and I mean to collect no toll. I mean to build a staircase to heaven and lock all out with exception to those of my choosing. I mean...\" \n\n\"I mean to have you point me in the direction of this man for a twenty.\" I interrupted him, showing the photo of the brother in one hand, and in the other a twenty. He took it without hesitation and rummaged through his shopping cart. He pulled out a photo of an old campground. Unnamed and unfamiliar. Before I could ask him more, what I assumed was his son had brought more alcohol. As I left lighting a cigarette, he continued to rant to the child as they shared a bottle. \n\nI looked up all the nearby campgrounds, none matched. I ended up going to the library on the edge of the city to look up old records that perhaps may have not been transcribed to the internet. Upon arriving, I watched two men jump an old woman. I watched from my car as they preceded to rip away her purse and threw her to the ground. A man with a dog walking by witnessed it, just as me, and continued walking. He got angry at his dog who was barking at the two men who were now running away with her purse, necklace, and high heels. I lit a cigarette, watched as the woman stumbled away, and I entered the library. \n\nInside, I began going through records of old campgrounds smoking as I did. This made the Libarian angry, and he almost said a word but did nothing. As I searched, I found the exact photo and a another of its demolishment for an outdoor retail store. A loud crash outside had caught my attention.\n\nRushing to the window I could see the back of my car totaled and the front another smashed. I put my cigarette out and went to talk with the idiot who had ran into my parked car. To my surprise it was a cop, and he ended up turning off his body cam and gave me a ticket for reckless driving. People walked by ignoring the crash. I started my car and attempted to drive to the store. \n\nAbout halfway my back tires gave out, not being able to afford a mechanic I continued on foot. Finally making it to the store, I light up and noticed another beggar with a sign that read, please adopt and give her a home. It was a mother giving up her daughter for adoption. As the bell to the store front rang, I noticed the store owner. The store owner looked like a typical redneck and was pale with long-thin strands of hair that were scantly placed on his head. A crooked and mismatched row of yellowed ivory filled his mouth. Acting like I took interest in his store's wares, I struck up a conversation which led to me being tied up in his basement. \n\n\"Wacha looking for sir?\"\n\n\"A new flyrod. Old one broke catching the biggest trout you ever saw.\" \n\n\"I'm gonna have to ask you to put out that cigarette sir.\" He said ignoring my story, I looked around and noticed another employee. Small and fat, but with what looked like hands that could crush boulders. He was smoking a fat cigar which barley hang from his lip. \"Why does he get to smoke?\"\n\n\"Cause he works here.\"\n\n\"If I buy something, can I keep smoking?\" He responds mockingly with, \"If you buy something can I keep fucking your mother?\" Both started to burst with laughter. The employee laughs so hard his cigar falls from his mouth and he squeals like a pig trying to retrieve it. \"Now put out the cigarette.\" I do. \n\n\"So, what was it you were saying?\" He said looking away from me as he started to thumb through a wad of cash he pulled from his pocket. \n\n\"I wanted a new flyrod, but I also have some questions ab...\"\n\n\"Hank!\" He shouted suddenly, startling me a bit. \"How much money you got?\" The employee Held up his hand and made a zero. \"Those fellas up in the hills still looking for food?\" I look back and hank was shaking his head up and down, rolling his neck fat. \"Fella, you said you had some questions, right?\" Looking back at him for a second, I immediately turn back around as I hear Hank start running towards me. Before I could react, I'm tackled to the ground. \n\n\"For fuck's sake Hank don't crush the man to death. I'll be back with the rope.\" Hank was squealing with excitement when he was on top of me. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I heard the shop owner in the back cursing and rummaging through stuff. The tackle had knocked all the air out of me, and with Hank crushing my lungs I couldn't take a single breath. Struggling to escape, I wiggled with no progress and my ears ringed as I heard the bell of the store front door. A man walked in, saw the sight, and left. \"Good Job Hank, help me tie this bastard.\" Hank got off of me and I took my chance. I sprang forward, head butting the store owner in the stomach. I turn around and ran past Hank and out the door. \n\nI had ran all the way to my apartment. I locked the door and lit a cigarette.  With no leads I had trouble sleeping, which was good because I was awake for when something had crashed through my window. When I got up to look out the window a large shadowy figure grabbed me. He pulled me through the window, cutting my back on the broken glass. Hank had put me in a choke hold then I fell asleep. \n\nWaking up, I saw nothing. Complete darkness coupled with complete silence. I was bound and gagged with my back against what felt like the corner of the room. For hours nothing happened. I saw nothing, I heard nothing, and I imagined the worst. When suddenly without warning the lights flicker alive. Under the light was the store owner, and he walked towards me. \n\nLooking around there was barley anything, an empty basement with the exception of a few sacks and rope. \"Who said you could wake up?\" I tried to respond through the gag, which I now noticed was one of those red balls, to no avail. After seeing that gag my imagination got worse but trust me that didn't happen. He grabbed my hair and drug me to the sacks. I started to try and plea but every time I spoke, he would kick my side. \n\nNow in the sack I couldn't see anything again. I felt being dragged up the stairs and I heard the store owner yelling for Hank to help him. I heard the ring of the store bell as cool air rushed into the tiny hole in the sack. To tiny to really see anything though. I was thrown unto hard steel and I heard the engine of a truck come alive. I was hauled out of town like a sack of grain. \n\nWhen the truck finally stopped, I heard two sets of feet unload me and drag me through what felt like foliage. Then it felt like wood, then concrete, then cold smooth tile. The sack was lifted, and it took a second for my eyes to adjust to the blinding light. When I can see my face is met with two women dressed as nuns. Except there was no sign of religious symbols, and their gowns were all in white. They hoisted my up to the wall with my hand above my head and I began to hang. They left the room. \n\nStill gagged I couldn't say anything. I started to look around. It reminded me of a kitchen in a fancy restaurant, but this one would have been abandoned for several years. Grim covered the corners of everything. All the white has turned into a pale yellow. The appliances appear broken beyond repair. Above me, the rope between my hand dangle me on a rusted meat hook. To my left was a big wooden table with blotches of red stain. On top was a man shackled. Blonde, Fit, and missing his right leg. \n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing. I couldn't believe I was stuck in what seemed to be a horror movie. The man's leg was left untreated. I could see the scar and the exposed flesh and cut veins that went up to the middle of his thigh. Looking at his skin he was so pale there was no way he was alive. The huge pomegranate colored stain near the cut helped my reasoning. \n\nThe musty smell clung to the walls around me and the stale remnants of grease and oil seeps from the tiles near the appliances. The smell of death clouds the air. Making it thick and unbearable to breathe. Most horrifying wasn't the smell or the dead man, or even the smell of a dead man but the wall of instruments by the table. Rusted or stained read, there was a junky shine to each saw and blade. Butcher knives, hack saws, drills, and even a chainsaw was hanging in neat organization. \n\nThe door in front of me, also rusted with a round smudged window in the top middle, flung open. A man in a complete dark red robe paces in. Completely bald, he was the brother I had been searching for. He quickly runs to the instruments near the table. The two nuns in white follow. \n\n\"NO! PLEASE NO!\" It wasn't me screaming, or the people who walked in. It was the blonde man I had written off as dead. He starts shaking violently but weak. The man in red grabs a handsaw and fumbles it. The sound of it clanging against tile sets off the blonde man in a fury of screams. He picks up the handsaw slams it down on his left thigh. After, the rhythmic back and forth is accompanied with the wet squelchy echo and squirts of blood. The continuous screaming stops with a thud. The blonde man's head falls back on the table with his face frozen in a twisted contort of pain and shock. He had hit bone. He pulls out the handsaw, with bits of gore falling from its teeth, and he plugs in the hacksaw. It comes alive with a buzz and a sharp grating sound ends with a snap. The man quickly unplugs, switches, and finishes with the handsaw. \n\nDistracted by the macabre display, I had lost tract of the two nuns. They had a large baking pan, and the man place the entire leg in there. The man walks out with the two nuns hauling the leg away. He slams the door and the sound of lock rings in my head for minutes. At that time, I didn't know what to do. When the sound of the lock stopped, I snapped. \n\nI started to swing back and forth. The hook hinged and squeaked till it broke. I fell and used the hook to break free from the ropes. I ran straight to the wall of hellish tools and tried to start the chainsaw. No fuel. I settle for a hammer and butcher knife.\n\nI walk to the door and try to open it with no luck. I wait till it opens. Hours must've passed until I hear the lock start to disengage. I ready myself, hammer held high, and as soon as a figure walks in, I swing. It was one of the nuns. My hammer slams into the center of her head and with a large smack she falls to the ground. Her sister nun runs in and grabs her body. Speaking franticly in a language I couldn't understand, crying at her feet. She looked at me the looked away. \n\nIt all had happened so fast; I don't remember all the details. I was in a frantic fight and flight mode. I remember rushing out locking them in and running down an even more decrepit tiled hall. A yellow light glowed from a doorway on the side of the hall ahead. As it grew closer, I heard the sound of chatter. As I turn my head, I stop in my tracks to see the great hall. \n\nA long wooden table, kept to pristine nearly perfect condition. Lavish plates, silverware, candle sticks, and chalices all lined perfectly. The people all wore expensive tuxedos and glowing white dresses, adored with glossy crystal masks that cover the face from the nose up.  All of them had turned their heads to look at me. \n\nOn their plates were various cuts of meat. No vegetables, no bread, no desserts. Just meat. Their chalices filled with a red liquid, which I would suppose came from what looked like unmarked wine bottles. The big serving dish had a giant pike, like a kabob, spiked through a cooked leg. Beside that was a head, an arm, feet, hands, etc. The serving dish next to it, even bigger had an entire woman on it. Cooked with a burnt crispy outer shell and pink flesh inside. \n\nThe chandelier was made of limbs. Arms and legs tangled and twisted together to form a giant circle. Hands with palms open hold the candles. The mantel above the fire piece was by far the most important. As an unusually large head of a pig, with skin patched together, hang with arms protruding all around it. Looking like a giant art piece, across the pig's forehead signed: Pasce in nomine eius et laetare. \n\nI stood for a good three seconds, longest three seconds of my life as I remember every detail. I began to sprint. Running down the hall, I glance back and see all of those people starting to exit that room and run down the hall at me. Panting, never wanting to look back, I run till my legs burn. A staircase leads me to a floor panel that opens upon my approach. \n\nI exit to a wooden cabin. Complete with bunkbeds, canoes hanging from the ceiling, and a poster. A poster which had A giant anthropomorphic pig with kids at a campfire which reads again: Pasce in nomine eius et laetare. I ran out of the cabin into a campground in the middle of the night. I continue running towards the road ignoring everything, nearly getting run over a couple times. \n\nI had started to walk along the road, the moonlight guiding my way back to the city. While walking, I try and hitchhike to which I got blaring horns and curses yelled at my way. Finaly entering the edge of the city, I see the library. This is where I am as of posting this. I had gotten on a computer to write all this out. I am afraid to go home since they have my phone and wallet and could probably figure out where I live. I haven't had time to really think about everything, please comment about what you think I should do. If I get to another computer, I hope I can respond or at least take your advice. \n\n"},"13":{"title":"help!! does anyone remember this creepy pasta ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwpm0j\/help_does_anyone_remember_this_creepy_pasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"allhallowsprods","selftext":"this is going to sound vague, and through extensive google searching it seems like multiple stories like this existed. i remember a lengthy, really terrifying story from years ago that was centered around following a set of rules so you could see the afterlife while still being able to come back from it. the story was written in a really surreal way, and i remember there being a hallway that the character was instructed to walk down, but you couldn’t look up at faces or paintings on the wall or something. it was multi step, like 20+ things you had to do, and even the tiniest mistake or slip up would send you to hell with no way of getting back. anyone remember this? 🤔"},"14":{"title":"I met my Soulmate in Shanghai....

The city’s chaotic energy did little to ease the numbness that had settled in my bones. I hadn’t returned to China since I was a child, and even then, it was a fleeting visit, a brief encounter with distant relatives I never thought I’d see again. Now, I was back to settle an estate that felt more like a burden than a gift.\n\nThe death of my uncle, a man I barely knew, had summoned me here. I had only vague memories of him from my childhood, blurry images of a quiet man standing at the edge of family gatherings. When I was contacted by the lawyer handling his estate, the news didn’t hit me with the shock one might expect. Instead, it felt like a summons, an obligation to a man whose life had been a mystery to me. Still, I accepted out of duty more than curiosity, and now found myself in the heart of a city that thrived on life, while I felt nothing but the weight of death.\n\nAfter dealing with the legal formalities, I wandered through the neon-lit streets, the skyscrapers towering above me, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like fingers in the night. The lawyer had been distant, dismissive even, handing me the keys to the old family property with little more than a formal nod. \"It's all in your hands now,\" he had said, and the words echoed in my mind, heavy with implication. What did he mean by that?\n\nI found myself by the river, watching the lights from the Bund reflect on the water. The city hummed with life around me, but it felt as though I was drifting, disconnected, a stranger in my own family’s history. That’s when I saw him.\n\nHe stood casually by the railing, his silhouette illuminated by the glow of the skyline. There was something about him that caught my attention immediately. Perhaps it was the way he stood, confident yet reserved, or the way his eyes flickered toward me before I had even realized I was staring. He didn’t belong to the crowd; that much was clear. He seemed... separate, like a fragment of the night itself.\n\n\"Beautiful night, isn't it?\"\n\nHis voice was smooth, almost melodic, breaking through the ambient noise of the city. There was a warmth in his tone that made the hairs on the back of my neck rise, an unsettling, magnetic pull.\n\nI hesitated for a moment before responding. \"It is,\" I said softly, unsure why I was suddenly nervous. His gaze was intense, almost too intense, but there was an undeniable charm in his smile. I found myself drawn to him, feeling a spark of something I hadn’t felt since I’d arrived, a connection in a place that had so far made me feel utterly alone.\n\n\"Lei.. he introduced himself, holding out a hand. His grip was firm but cold, a subtle chill that lingered even after he released it.\n\nWe fell into an easy conversation as we walked along the riverside, the lights of the city shimmering on the surface of the water beside us. Lei was charismatic, attentive in a way that made me forget, if only for a moment, why I was even in Shanghai. He asked about me, about my life, but deflected when I asked about his. Mysterious, I thought. Maybe a little too mysterious, but I was intrigued. After all, what harm was there in a little distraction from the heaviness of death?\n\nBy the time we parted ways, exchanging numbers, I felt a strange sense of relief. For the first time since I’d arrived, I wasn’t alone. But as I made my way back to the sleek, modern apartment I was renting, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei had been watching me long before I had noticed him.\n\nThe following days passed in a blur of paperwork and phone calls. The estate had more complications than I expected, deeds, assets, and family relics I had never heard of. Each conversation with the lawyer brought new surprises, like my uncle’s ownership of an old house tucked away in one of Shanghai’s forgotten districts. The thought of going there alone made me uneasy, so I kept putting it off. Something about the way the lawyer had brushed off questions about the house felt wrong, as though he didn’t want to talk about it.\n\nBut in between the stress, there was Lei.\n\nWe had been seeing each other almost every day. Dinners, late-night walks, and quiet conversations in quiet cafes. It was easy to get lost in his charm, his ease of conversation, the way he seemed to understand everything without me having to explain. Still, I couldn’t help but feel there was something he wasn’t telling me, something just beneath the surface. He would smile, but sometimes the smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.\n\nOne night, after a particularly grueling day dealing with the estate, Lei invited me to his apartment. The invitation felt natural, a progression in what had quickly become a relationship .\n\nHis apartment was on the outskirts of the city, in a high-rise that seemed out of place among the old neighborhoods it towered over. The interior was modern, sleek, and spotless. Yet it felt sterile. There were no personal touches, no photos or signs of a life lived. Just perfect, polished surfaces.\n\n“You must be exhausted,” Lei said, as he poured me a glass of wine. I nodded, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. The warmth of the wine helped a little, but the coldness of the apartment clung to me.\n\nAs we sat together on his pristine couch, I couldn’t help but notice how still he was. Too still. His movements, usually smooth and graceful, now seemed rehearsed, like each gesture was part of an intricate performance. And then, for the briefest moment, I saw it.\n\nA crack.\n\nIt was small, barely noticeable, but it ran along the edge of his jawline. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but when I blinked, it was gone, as if it had never been there. My breath hitched in my throat. I wanted to ask him, to say something, but the words died before they left my lips. I stared at my wine glass instead, forcing myself to relax, to ignore what I had just seen.\n\n“Is something wrong?” Lei’s voice cut through my thoughts, soft but probing.\n\nI shook my head quickly, plastering on a smile. “No, I’m just... tired.”\n\nHe watched me for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable, before nodding. “Of course. It’s been a long week for you.”\n\nHis hand touched mine, cold against my skin, and for a second, I could swear I felt that same crack beneath his fingers. A chill raced through me, but I said nothing.\n\nThe days that followed should have felt normal, but nothing did. My work with the estate became an afterthought, replaced by an obsession I couldn’t shake: Lei. Something about him gnawed at my mind, filling every quiet moment with unease. I kept replaying that night in his apartment, convincing myself that the crack I’d seen was just a trick of my exhausted mind.\n\nBut the more I tried to rationalize it, the worse the feeling became. It wasn’t just that. He was changing, or at least, my perception of him was. Small things, barely noticeable at first. His voice would sometimes sound too smooth, almost unnatural. His movements, always so graceful, seemed too deliberate, like they were mimicked rather than natural.\n\nAnd the dreams... They started shortly after that night in his apartment.\n\nIn the first dream, I was standing at the foot of Lei’s bed. He was lying there, asleep, but something was wrong. His face was smooth and flawless as always, but then, slowly, the skin began to peel away. It didn’t bleed, and there was no pain, just layers of flesh slipping off, revealing something hideous underneath. A twisted, contorted face with hollow eyes that stared back at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.\n\nI woke in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the sheets tangled around me. It was just a dream, I told myself, over and over again.\n\nThe next few days passed in a blur of paranoia. Every time I met with Lei, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me too closely, studying me. And the crack I’d seen that night? It started appearing more often. Sometimes it was on his jaw, sometimes his hands. Each time it would disappear before I could get a second look, but I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.\n\nOne afternoon, I decided it was finally time to visit my uncle’s old house. The place had been left untouched for years, gathering dust and sinking into disrepair. The lawyer’s vague descriptions and dismissiveness had only fueled my curiosity. I had been avoiding it, reluctant to confront whatever history might be buried there, but the weight of uncertainty was starting to suffocate me.\n\nThe house stood at the end of a narrow street, hidden among overgrown trees and faded stone walls. It was a stark contrast to the sleek, modern apartment I had been staying in. Everything about this place felt old, forgotten, like it belonged to a different era altogether. I pushed open the creaking door, a rush of stale air hitting me as I stepped inside.\n\nI spent hours going through piles of papers, yellowed books, and fading family mementos. My uncle’s life was scattered across the rooms, half-forgotten, and for a while, it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s memories. The deeper I dug, the more disoriented I became. Dusty photographs, letters written in fading ink, items that seemed to have no connection to me at all.\n\nAt the bottom of a worn leather box, buried beneath stacks of old papers, was an old photograph. The paper was fragile, worn around the edges, but it was the faces in the picture that sent a chill through me. I stared at the image, two men standing side by side. One of them I recognized immediately as my great-uncle, though he was much younger in the picture. But it was the man beside him that made my skin crawl.\n\nIt was Lei...\n\nThe photograph had to be at least 60 years old, judging by the way the men were dressed. Yet Lei looked exactly the same as he did now. His face was unchanged, smooth, flawless, and unaged. The realization hit me like a blow to the chest, my hands trembling as I held the picture closer to examine it. No one could look the same after all this time.\n\nI flipped the photograph over, hoping for some explanation, but the back was blank. No dates, no names, nothing that could tell me who these men were to each other or why this picture existed. A wave of nausea rolled through me. It wasn’t just Lei's unnerving perfection anymore. There was something far darker at play here, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my family long before I arrived in Shanghai.\n\nThe air in the room felt thick, suffocating, and I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to leave. I shoved the photograph into my bag and rushed out of the house, not bothering to lock the door behind me.\n\nAs I walked back to the apartment, the city’s noise became distant, muffled by the thoughts crashing through my mind. Lei wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. The photograph was proof, proof that he had existed far longer than any normal person should. But why? And why was he here, now, in my life? The questions spun wildly in my head, but no answers came. I felt a growing sense of dread, as if the world around me was closing in.\n\nThat night, I lay awake in bed, the photograph resting on the table beside me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Lei’s face, his perfect, unchanging face, and the crack I had seen on his skin.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up feeling heavy, as though the weight of the photograph had settled deep inside my chest, squeezing my lungs. I hadn’t slept well. Every creak in the apartment made me bolt upright, expecting to find Lei standing in the shadows, watching me. The rational part of my brain kept trying to soothe me, to tell me that I was overreacting, but the photograph on the table beside me said otherwise.\n\nI couldn’t just ignore it. I needed answers, but I wasn’t sure how to get them. Who could I even trust at this point?\n\nI decided to meet Lei later that day. I wasn’t ready to confront him, not yet, but I needed to see him. I needed to figure out if there was any part of this man that was still... normal, still human. Maybe I could find a crack in the façade that would explain all of this. Or maybe I was walking straight into a trap.\n\nWhen he greeted me outside a café, his smile was just as flawless as it always had been. But now, I couldn’t unsee the truth. I couldn’t shake the image of the photograph, the knowledge that he had been standing beside my great-uncle, looking exactly the same as he did now. How long had he been hiding this? And why?\n\n“You seem distant today,” Lei said, his eyes narrowing slightly as we sat down. “Is everything alright?”\n\nI forced a smile, fighting the growing panic in my chest. “Yeah, just... didn’t sleep too well last night.”\n\nHe studied me carefully, too carefully, as if he knew I was hiding something. There was something in his gaze that I hadn’t noticed before, something calculating and cold. I could feel my pulse racing, the walls of the café closing in around me.\n\nI needed to leave.\n\nBut before I could excuse myself, Lei’s hand reached across the table, resting lightly on mine. His touch, once so warm and reassuring, now felt like ice. “You’ve been different lately,” he said, his voice too smooth, too controlled. “Distracted.”\n\nI swallowed hard, trying to pull my hand away, but his grip tightened.\n\nI yanked my hand free, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I need to go.”\n\nLei’s expression didn’t change, but there was something in his eyes that sent a shiver down my spine. He knew. He knew I had seen something, and now there was no going back.\n\nI left the café in a rush, not daring to look back. My hands were trembling as I hurried down the street, my mind racing. I needed to figure out what I was dealing with, but who could help me? The police? No, they’d think I was insane. My friends? They were thousands of miles away, and besides, they wouldn’t understand. No one would.\n\nExcept maybe... the lawyer.\n\nThe thought hit me like a lightning bolt. He had been so dismissive, so eager to hand off my uncle’s estate and wash his hands of it. But now that I thought about it, there had been something strange about the way he avoided answering my questions about my family’s past. Maybe he knew more than he let on. Maybe he could help me understand what was happening.\n\nI grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my fingers shaking as I pressed it to my ear.\n\n“Hello?” His voice crackled through the line, sharp and impatient.\n\n“It’s me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my uncle... something really strange is going on.”\n\nThere was a pause on the other end, longer than I expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was quieter, more measured. “Meet me at my office. We’ll talk.”\n\nI hung up, a knot of anxiety twisting in my gut. The way he had said it, \"we’ll talk,\" felt loaded with meaning. He knew something. I could feel it.\n\nThe lawyer’s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it. The building was unremarkable, with peeling paint and a small sign that looked like it hadn’t been changed in years. I wasn’t sure why I had come here, but my instincts told me this was my only lead. If anyone could give me answers about my uncle’s strange past, it would be Mr. Feng.\n\nI stepped inside, the musty smell of old paper and dust greeting me. He sat behind his desk, his sharp eyes flicking up from a stack of documents as I entered.\n\n“I thought you were done with the estate,” he muttered, setting his papers aside.\n\nI shook my head, suddenly unsure how to begin. “It’s not about the estate. I’ve... I’ve found something. Something strange.”\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to curiosity. “Go on.”\n\nI hesitated, pulling the photograph from my bag and sliding it across the desk. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing as he examined the faded image of my great-uncle and Lei standing together, decades ago.\n\n“This photo. It’s old,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “But the man in it... He hasn’t aged. That’s Lei. The same man I’ve been seeing for the past few weeks. He looks exactly the same.”\n\nMr. Feng’s face paled as his fingers tightened around the photograph. He stared at it for a long moment, then placed it carefully on the desk, his hands trembling slightly.\n\n“Where did you find this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, tinged with something I couldn’t quite place. Fear, maybe.\n\n“In my uncle’s house,” I replied. “I was going through his things and... I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But something about Lei. There’s something wrong with him.”\n\nHe sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. He seemed older now, more worn down than when I had first met him. “I had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. Then, louder: “Your uncle was involved in something. Something he didn’t want to talk about.”\n\nI leaned forward. “What do you mean? What was he involved in?”\n\nHe stood up, pacing behind his desk. “Your family has been in Shanghai for generations. There are old stories, legends about strange things happening to people connected to your bloodline. Disappearances, sightings, people aging too quickly or not at all. I thought it was just nonsense, superstitions passed down through the years. But when I saw your uncle’s estate and how quickly he wanted it all handled, I suspected something else.”\n\nHe paused, glancing at the photograph again. “But this... this is proof.”\n\nMy mouth went dry. “Proof of what?”\n\n“Proof that whatever your uncle was trying to escape has come back. And now it’s after you.”\n\nThe words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I shook my head, trying to process what he was saying. “Lei isn’t... he’s not human, is he?”\n\nMr. Feng didn’t answer right away. He seemed to struggle with the words, finally saying, “There’s an old legend, one that speaks of creatures that can take the form of humans. They use their appearance to deceive, to lure people in. These creatures, these painted skin demons, have been around for centuries, feeding on those they can trap.”\n\nI felt a wave of nausea wash over me, my vision blurring as the reality of what he was saying set in. “And you think... you think Lei is one of them?”\n\nHe nodded grimly. “I’m almost certain. Your uncle tried to run from this, but he wasn’t fast enough. You need to leave Shanghai. Now.”\n\nI stood up, my legs shaky. “But how... how do I stop him? How do I get away?”\n\nHe looked at me with pity in his eyes. “I don’t know if you can. But you need to try.”\n\nI left Mr. Feng’s office with a cold knot of fear in my stomach. The streets outside were busy as always, but everything felt distant, muffled, like I was moving through a dream I couldn’t wake up from. The world around me no longer felt real. Nothing did.\n\nMy mind raced as I hurried back to my apartment. Mr. Feng’s words echoed in my head, each one tightening the noose of dread around my chest. Painted skin demon. The idea sounded ridiculous, something pulled straight out of a horror movie. But the photograph, Lei... I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore. I had seen it with my own eyes. I had felt it in my gut. Lei wasn’t human, and now I was part of whatever dark game he was playing.\n\nI fumbled with the keys to my apartment, my hands shaking as I let myself inside. The door slammed shut behind me, and I locked it quickly, as if the flimsy bolt could keep something like him out. The apartment was quiet, too quiet. I moved to the window, pulling the curtains shut, trying to block out the city beyond. For the first time since I’d arrived in Shanghai, I felt trapped, cornered by something I didn’t understand.\n\nI needed to leave. Mr. Feng was right; there was no point in trying to confront Lei. I had to get as far away from him as possible. My flight back to the United States wasn’t scheduled for another week, but I couldn’t wait that long. I had to find a way out now.\n\nI packed quickly, throwing my belongings into my suitcase with shaking hands. As I zipped up the bag, my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Lei.\n\n“Dinner tonight? I miss you.”\n\nMy heart lurched in my chest. The words were innocent, casual even, but now they sent a jolt of terror through me. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he reach out now, after everything? I stared at the message, my hands cold and clammy, before forcing myself to respond.\n\n“I’m not feeling well. Maybe another time.”\n\nI set the phone down and took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic rhythm of my heartbeat. I didn’t have much time. I needed to book a flight, get out of the apartment, and disappear before Lei realized what I was doing.\n\nI was about to start searching for flights when the phone buzzed again. Another message.\n\n“I can come over. Take care of you.”\n\nI dropped the phone, my pulse spiking. He was too close, too eager. I had to move. Now.\n\nI grabbed my suitcase and darted toward the door. Just as I reached for the handle, there was a knock. Three sharp raps echoed through the apartment like a death knell.\n\n“Hey! it’s me.”\n\nLei’s voice...\n\nI stumbled back from the door, my mind spinning. How had he gotten here so fast? I hadn’t even told him where I lived, had I? Panic surged through me as the knocking came again, louder this time.\n\n“Are you in there?” Lei’s voice was smooth, calm, but there was an edge to it now, something that made my skin crawl. “You didn’t answer my message.”\n\nI clutched my suitcase, my back pressed against the far wall of the apartment. I could hear him moving outside the door, his footsteps slow, deliberate, like he was waiting for something.\n\n“I know you’re in there,” he said softly, almost playfully now. “Don’t you want to see me?”\n\nI didn’t respond. I couldn’t. Every instinct in my body was screaming for me to stay silent, to keep as far away from the door as possible. But I knew I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out. My eyes darted around the apartment, searching for an escape.\n\nThe fire escape. My window led to the back of the building, where the fire escape ladder could take me down to the alley below. It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was the only chance I had. I moved as quietly as I could, tiptoeing toward the window. I slid it open slowly, wincing at the faint creak of the hinges.\n\nJust as I was about to climb out, my phone buzzed again. Another message.\n\n“Where do you think you’re going?”\n\nMy stomach twisted. I looked down at the phone in horror. There was no way he could have known. Unless he could see me.\n\nI didn’t have time to think. I clambered out the window, gripping the cold metal of the fire escape as I hurried down the ladder, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The alley was dark and narrow, the shadows thick between the buildings. I hit the ground running, my suitcase dragging behind me as I raced toward the street. I didn’t know where I was going; all I knew was that I needed to get away.\n\nThe city felt like a maze, the streets twisting and turning, leading me nowhere. My mind was racing, a jumble of fear and panic that blurred the world around me. I had no plan, no clear destination. I just kept running, hoping that the distance would be enough to keep him away.\n\nBut it wasn’t long before I realized that something was wrong.\n\nNo matter how far I ran, no matter how many streets I crossed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close. Too close. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw him, just a flicker of movement in the crowd, a face too familiar among the strangers passing by.\n\nI ducked into a nearby café, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. I couldn’t keep running like this. I needed to get out of Shanghai, and fast. I couldn’t just sit here, waiting for him to find me. I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through flights. There was a late-night flight leaving for the United States in a few hours. It was expensive, but I didn’t care. I booked it without thinking, my hands trembling as I entered my payment details.\n\nFor a moment, I allowed myself to exhale, feeling the tension in my body loosen just a little. The café was quiet, a small bubble of normalcy amid the chaos that had consumed my life. The low hum of conversations and the clinking of coffee cups gave me a false sense of comfort. I looked around. No sign of Lei. He wasn’t here. Not now.\n\nI slid further into the booth, my legs trembling beneath the table. The adrenaline that had been keeping me on my feet for hours was starting to wear off, replaced by a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. I had barely slept in days, and now that I was sitting still, the weight of everything was crashing down on me. My body was screaming for rest, but my mind wouldn’t stop racing. Every nerve in my body told me to stay alert, to keep moving, but I couldn’t anymore. Just for a moment, I told myself. Just a moment to close my eyes and breathe. I must have only intended to rest for a minute or two, but exhaustion claimed me completely.\n\nI don’t know how long I had been asleep, maybe an hour, maybe less, but when I woke, the café felt different. The air was thick, stifling, and there was a strange silence that hung heavy in the room.\n\nI was still winking the sleep away when suddenly , the screen lit up with a new message.\n\n“You can’t hide from me.”\n\nA cold wave of terror crashed over me, snapping me out of my drowsy haze. I had fallen asleep. I had let my guard down, and now... now he was here. Or close. I shoved my phone into my bag and bolted for the door .\n\nI burst onto the street, my pulse racing as I frantically scanned the crowd for any sign of Lei. Every shadow, every figure felt like a threat, like he was lurking just out of view. I couldn't see him, but I knew he was there. Watching. Waiting.\n\nI waved down the first taxi I saw, nearly tripping over myself as I climbed into the backseat. The driver barely glanced at me as I gave him the address for the airport, my voice shaky and strained. He pulled away from the curb, the hum of the engine a faint comfort as the city began to blur past the windows.\n\nI gripped the edge of the seat, trying to steady my breathing. The flight was booked, and I had a few hours left to make it to the airport. All I had to do was get on that plane. Once I was in the air, once I left Shanghai, I’d be free. At least, that’s what I told myself.\n\nBut the uneasy feeling that had settled in the pit of my stomach refused to fade. Lei had found me so easily before. How had he known I was in the café? How had he always been one step ahead?\n\nThe taxi began slowing down.\n\nI glanced up and I saw a pair of red taillights ahead, blinking in the dark. There was a construction vehicle blocking the road, a detour sign flashing in the dim light. The driver sighed, pulling the car to a stop.\n\n“Looks like we’ll have to take a different route,” he muttered, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.\n\nI nodded, but something felt... off. The street was too quiet, the shadows too thick. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lei was still close, no matter how fast I tried to escape.\n\nSuddenly, a loud bang shattered the silence.\n\nI gasped as the passenger window exploded inward, glass raining down like shards of ice. My heart seized in my chest as I turned to see him: Lei. His hand gripping the edge of the broken window, his dark eyes locking onto mine. He moved too fast, too silent, like a predator that had been lurking in the shadows all along.\n\nHis hand lunged through the window, reaching for me with terrifying speed. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and unyielding. I jerked back, my heart hammering in my throat, but his grip was like iron, tightening around my wrist. He pulled harder, his strength inhuman, dragging me toward the shattered window, shards of glass cutting into my skin.\n\n\"You’re not leaving,\" he growled, his voice low and menacing, sending a chill down my spine. \"You’ll never leave me.\"\n\nThe driver let out a panicked shout, and the car lurched forward with a screech of tires. The sudden momentum ripped Lei's grip from my wrist and sent him crashing to the ground with brutal force.\n\nThe driver swore loudly, the air thick with panic.\n\nI dared a glance over my shoulder, terrified of what I might see.\n\nIn the middle of the road, Lei rose slowly to his feet, his movements unnaturally fluid. His head tilted slightly, his eyes locked on the taxi, and a twisted smile crept across his face.\n\n\"GO! PLEASE!\" I screamed, my voice cracking as I whipped back toward the driver.\n\nThe driver, pale and wide-eyed, nodded frantically, slamming his foot down on the gas pedal.\n\nThe moment the taxi pulled up to the airport, a wave of relief washed over me. I was almost there, just a few steps away from leaving Shanghai, from leaving Lei behind. The terminal was busy, packed with travelers hurrying to their gates, dragging luggage and speaking in rapid-fire conversations that blurred together. It was all so normal, so ordinary, that for the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope.\n\nI just had to make it through.\n\nDragging my suitcase behind me, I made my way through the throngs of people. I glanced at the departures board, my eyes darting to the flight that would take me back to Houston.\n\nI made my way directly to the boarding gate, and just nearby, I spotted a restroom. Needing a moment to collect myself, I headed into the women’s restroom, eager for a brief escape before boarding. The room was silent and empty, the cold fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Setting my bag down, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping to wash away the fear that clung to me like a shadow.\n\nFor a moment, I closed my eyes and breathed deeply. Just a few more minutes. I’ll be in the air, away from all of this.\n\nBut when I opened my eyes, everything changed.\n\nStanding behind me in the mirror.. Lei’s reflection filled the space just inches away. His eyes.. those cold..dark eyes, burned with something far more sinister than before. My heart seized in my chest as I spun around, but before I could scream, he lunged at me, his hand wrapping around my throat.\n\nMy breath hitched as his cold fingers closed tightly, squeezing the air from my lungs.\n\nBefore I could fight back, he lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing, his hand tightening around my neck. My feet dangled uselessly in the air, kicking wildly as panic flooded through me. The cold, tiled floor below seemed to stretch away, the world blurring around the edges of my vision...\n\nI clawed at his hand, my nails digging into his skin, but it didn’t matter. His grip didn’t loosen. He held me effortlessly, his dark eyes watching me with that same eerie calm, as if this were all part of some twisted game.\n\nMy chest burned, desperate for air. I gasped, but nothing came. My pulse pounded in my ears, and black spots danced at the corners of my vision. The pressure on my throat was unbearable. Every second, it grew tighter, crushing me from the inside out.\n\nHe leaned in closer, his voice a low, mocking whisper. “You really thought you could get away from me?”\n\nMy mind raced, desperate for a way out, for anything that could save me. But the bathroom was empty, and his grip was relentless.\n\nThen, the door swung open.\n\nA security guard stepped inside, his expression turning to confusion as he saw Lei in the women’s restroom. “Hey!” he called out, stepping forward.\n\nLET GO OF HER!”\n\nLei didn’t even flinch. His grip loosened on my neck for just a second, but it was enough for me to gasp for air, my body shaking with terror. The guard reached for Lei, trying to pull him away from me, but Lei moved too quickly. He turned on the guard, shoving him backward with a force that sent him crashing to the floor.\n\nThey struggled, the guard trying to fight back, but Lei was too strong, too fast. Lei grabbed the guard by the collar and slammed him against the wall with a brutal strength I hadn’t fully understood until now.\n\nBut in that moment, I saw my chance.\n\nWithout thinking, I ran toward the door, my legs trembling beneath me. I pushed it open and stumbled out into the busy terminal, gasping for air as I ran toward the gate.\n\nThe terminal was crowded, a sea of people rushing toward their gates. I ducked into the flow of bodies, weaving through the mass of travelers. I could still hear the sounds of the struggle behind me, but I didn’t dare look back. I had to reach the gate. I had to get on that plane.\n\nI could feel Lei’s presence behind me, even if he wasn’t there. His voice still echoed in my mind, his hands still wrapped around my throat.\n\nWhen I reached the gate, it was already boarding. The crowd of passengers offered me the cover I needed. I merged into the line, keeping my head down, my hands shaking as I handed my ticket to the agent. She smiled and waved me through, unaware of the terror that had been stalking me for days.\n\nI stepped onto the plane, the cool, pressurized air hitting me like a wave. Rows of seats stretched out in front of me, passengers already settled, tucking bags into overhead compartments and chatting quietly. I moved through the aisle like a ghost, my mind still racing, scanning every face for any sign of Lei. But he wasn’t here. Not anymore.\n\nI found my seat near the back of the plane, squeezing past a woman engrossed in her book, her headphones firmly in place. I sank into the window seat, my hands shaking as I buckled the seatbelt. The hum of the engines below was a faint comfort, something steady in the chaos.\n\nThe pit in my stomach tightened as the plane gathered speed, racing faster and faster down the runway. My fingers gripped the armrests, the tension rising with every passing second. I stared out the window, watching as the ground blurred beneath us, the airport shrinking away as the nose of the plane lifted into the sky.\n\nI had escaped.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nAs I sat there, staring out the window, I felt a strange tingling in my hand. I looked down, and my blood froze. There, on the inside of my palm, was a mark, faint, barely visible, but undeniably there. A thin crack, like the ones I had seen on Lei’s skin, ran across the surface of my hand. It was as if a part of him had stayed with me, even now, even after I had escaped.\n\nI clenched my fist, trying to ignore the chill creeping up my spine. I had made it onto the plane. I was leaving Shanghai. But I knew, deep down, that I hadn’t truly escaped him.\n\nI could still feel his presence. [Watching](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@herscreams).

It's amazing to have a ghostly voice echoing through out the house, as it gives the house so much more essence. As I murdered Rupert inside my house, I expected to hear his his ghostly voice run through out my home. Instead I started to hear ghostly sheep noises and I didn't kill a sheep inside my house? It was worrying to hear a sheep's ghostly voice echoing through out my home, and the suffering of animals is torture for me. Worst of all what would people think. \n\nThen I tried to drown out the ghostly sheep noises and i decided to befriend another idiot. This idiot is called barbatrude. I know a weird name but when I murdered barbatrude, I was hoping his ghostly scream would over take the ghostly sheep noise. when i was sure that barbatrude deathly and ghostly scream would drown out the sheep's ghostly echoes, I started to hear ghostly chicken screams. So now I had ghostly sheep and chicken noises echoing through out my house. I have a party soon and the people who I have invited hate animal cruelty, but love human cruelty. \n\nThis is another reason why I wanted to cover my house with ghostly noises of human suffering. I could have tried getting a video playing the sounds of human suffering, but it's not the same as ghostly human noises echoing through out the house. It gives the house an amazing aura when ghostly human suffering noises are echoing through out the house. I have to try and now cover up the sheep ghostly noises and the chicken ghostly noises. I was really freaking out and usually I freak out if the police arrive at my house with human ghostly noises echoing through out my house, now I don't have to worry about that. \n\nUsually the ghostly noises tend to fade out in a month or so. I am panicking about the party, and then I tried covering the two ghostly animal noises by killing two more people at the same time. Now I had more ghostly animal noises in my house. It sounded like a ghostly farm roaming around my house. It just doesn't make sense and when I tried explaining the party comers about the ghostly animal noises, they believed me because I showed them the human bodies as proof that I didn't kill any animals. \n\nStill they couldn't stand the ghostly animals noises and they all left. It is so strange.

The steady, unwavering rhythm of the clock filled the room. “Today is the day, I know all I need to.”\n\nTick, tock, tick, tock.\n\nThe seconds carried on, the silence hanging heavy and thick in the air, with nothing but the steady, unyielding tick-tock of the clock breaking through. Ezra's expression was impassive, betraying none of the determining thoughts that simmered beneath the surface.\n\nTick, tock, tick, tock.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room grew heavy and oppressive, as if the very space around them had become a living, responsive thing, brimming with anticipation for the meeting to come. Ezra's gaze glinted with a primal, ravenous hunger, his lips curling into a faint, grin.\n\nTick, tock, tick, tock.\n\nThe eerie silence was shattered by a soft, tentative knock that echoed through the dimly lit room like a gunshot. Ezra's eyes snapped open, his laser-like focus shattering as he was jolted back to the present moment. A muscle in his jaw twitched involuntarily, the only outward sign of the sudden surge of adrenaline coursing through his veins. The relentless march of time appeared to screech to a standstill, the very air practically suffocating with a tense stillness.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEzra slowly rose from the high-backed leather chair, his long legs uncrossing with deliberate grace that contradicted the simmering tension beneath his composed exterior. His piercing blue eyes narrowed as he surveyed his flawless reflection in the gleaming brass doorknob.\n\nNot a single thread was out of place on his meticulously tailored grey suit, the fine fabric perfectly highlighting his tall, slender frame. His coal-black hair was neatly styled, not a strand daring to fall out of place. Ezra was the very picture of controlled power, every aspect of his refined, sophisticated look carefully projecting an air of unshakable confidence.\n\nReaching out, Ezra's long, slender fingers curled around the cool brass. He held his breath, the weight of the moment thick with anticipation. Slowly, deliberately, he twisted the knob, feeling the subtle mechanisms shifting and turning with a satisfying, mechanical precision. This doorknob, like every other meticulously selected element within his office, reflected his commitment to order and calculated control. With a final, resolute motion, Ezra pulled the heavy oak door open, the hinges creaking softly in protest.\n\nImmediately, a sudden rush of the outside world spilled into the dimly lit confines of his office, assaulting his senses. The muffled cacophony of the city - the rumble of traffic, the distant sounds of voices, the patter of rain against the pavement - all trespassing into the carefully controlled environment he had so meticulously managed.\n\nThere, hesitating nervously on the threshold, was Emily Glass - his client, a woman he had been meeting with for the past few weeks. Her neatly styled dark brown hair was pulled back into a severe, no-nonsense bun, the precise styling framing the modest, almost bashful ensemble she had chosen. The muted colors of her blouse and skirt did little to hide the delicate curves of her petite figure, the fabric clinging just enough to suggest a carefully restrained allure.\n\nEzra's lips curled into a subtle, appreciative smile as he took in Emily's appearance. The way the light played across her delicate features, casting soft shadows that accentuated the elegant lines of her petite figure - it was a sight he found himself looking forward to with each of their sessions. There was something captivating about the way she carried herself, a graceful balance that seemed to originate from within. \"Emily, you're looking lovely as always,\" he said, his voice low and warm, tinged with a note of genuine admiration.\n\nTheir eyes met, and Emily felt almost hypnotized by the warmth and familiarity in his gaze. There was a connection she had developed for him, an unspoken understanding that had grown steadily over the past weeks. She found herself drawn into those depths, her pulse quickening slightly as she felt the familiar pull of his charismatic presence.\n\n\"Thank you, Ezra,\" Emily replied, the faintest hint of a blush coloring her cheeks as she stepped into the room, her body moving almost of its own accord. She carried herself with quiet confidence, a composed demeanor that opposed the subtle fluttering of her heart.\n\n\"I'm so pleased you could join me.\" The easy confidence in his tone put her instantly at ease, and Emily found herself laughing lightly in response, the tension easing from her shoulders as she surrendered to the comfortable familiarity of their interactions.\n\nSettled now within the cozy confines of the room, Emily took in the familiar surroundings, not removing her eyes from Ezras figure. It was a space she had come to find comfort in over the past weeks - the plush armchair, the soothing neutral tones, the air of quiet seduction. With a small smile, she moved to take her usual seat, ready to start their discussion, though a part of her wished they could linger in the moment just a little while longer, as she savored the warmth and intimacy that seemed to flow so effortlessly.\n\nAs Emily settled into her usual seat, Ezra's gaze lingered on her, a hint of warmth and familiarity in his expression. \"Welcome back, Emily,\" he said, his voice carrying a velvet timbre that sent a subtle shiver down her spine. \"How have you been?\"\n\nEmily tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, a slight nervousness in her movements. \"I-I've been doing okay, I guess,\" she replied, her voice soft and a little shy. \"Things have been...well, a little better, I think.\"\n\nEzra nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. \"I'm glad to hear that.\" He leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled thoughtfully. \"And how have you been feeling, emotionally? Anything you'd like to share with me?\"\n\nEmily hesitated for a moment, her gaze darting down to her hands in her lap. \"Actually, there is something...\" She paused, taking a deep breath before meeting his eyes again. \"I... I’ve been thinking about you a lot, Ezra. More than I probably should.\" A faint blush crept across her cheeks.\n\nEzra's expression softened, and he reached out to gently squeeze her hand. \"Emily, you know you can be honest with me about anything. I'm here to listen, whenever you're ready to talk.\" His thumb traced small circles on the back of her hand, the touch electric and comforting all at once.\n\nEmily felt herself being drawn into his warmth, her own hand instinctively turning to entwine their fingers. \"I... I just feel so comfortable with you, Ezra,\" she admitted, her eyes shining with a mix of vulnerability and trust. \"I don't know, it's just...different, when I'm with you.\"\n\nEzra's expression softened, and he gently squeezed Emily's hand before pulling away. \"Emily, I appreciate your honesty. You know, I care about you deeply, but as your therapist, I have certain boundaries.\" He paused, considering his words carefully.\n\n“I know,” Emily replied, her voice barely above a whisper, a hint of uncertainty lacing her words. “It’s just that I can’t stop thinking about you, and I know I shouldn’t, but… I want to.”\n\nEzra’s gaze fell, his expression a haunting mix of disappointment and a sinister thrill. He began whispering words, sparking a dangerous curiosity for Emily. But just as she opened her mouth to probe deeper, his demeanor shifted. He flashed a broad smile, locking her in an intense gaze that felt…unique.\n\nThe air thickened with unspoken tension, and Emily felt a chill creeping up her spine, as if the shadows around them were listening, waiting. “Tell you what, how about we take a short break, and I'll brew us some tea?\" Ezra offered, his voice warm and reassuring. \"I find that a nice cup of tea can sometimes help calm the nerves and give us both a chance to collect our thoughts.\"\n\nEmily felt a flicker of disappointment, but she nodded, \"Tea would be great, thank you,\" she replied, trying to keep her tone neutral.\n\nAs Ezra stood and made his way to the small kitchenette in the corner of his office, Emily found herself missing his comforting presence. She couldn't help but wonder if she had overstepped some unspoken boundary, and a part of her longed for the intimacy they had shared just moments ago.\n\nEzra returned shortly, two steaming mugs of fragrant tea in hand. \"Here you are,\" he said, handing one to Emily. \"I find a good Earl Grey can do wonders.\" He settled back into his chair, his gaze thoughtful.\n\nEmily clutched the warm mug as if it were her only lifeline, desperately trying to hold on to the fleeting sense of familiarity and safety it provided. But as she sipped the liquid, a creeping dizziness overtook her, and she felt like she was being pulled into a half-formed nightmare.\n\nHer eyes met Ezra's, but instead of finding comfort in his gaze, she saw a flicker of uncertainty and a silent plea for him to bridge the growing gap between them. His smile chilled her to the bone as he sat down his cup, the warmth of the room dissipating with his every move.\n\n\"Why do I feel so strange?\" she murmured, shadows flickering at the edges of her vision like twisted remnants of a nightmare.\n\nEzra's chilling words hung heavily in the air, a dire omen that sent panic surging through her body. \"Your longing for affection has clouded your judgment,\" he said with an evil gleam in his eyes.\n\nThe room spun around her as she tried to make sense of what was happening. She reached out for Ezra, but he seemed impossibly far away, shrouded in an aura of dread.\n\nAs if sensing her fear, the mug slipped from her fingers and shattered against the floor, a violent end to her fleeting sense of safety. The shards glimmered ominously in the flickering candlelight as she stood frozen, heart pounding, under the weight of Ezra's words.\n\n\"What's happening?\" she whispered, her voice trembling with fear.\n\nBut Ezra only rose from his chair like a dark specter looming over her.\n\n“Emily, I need to ask you something.” “Why did you cheat on your husband and abandon your children?” His voice dripped with the bitterness of betrayal, and her breath caught in her throat. “Why did you end life before it even began?\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening, each second stretching into eternity. Suddenly, a grotesque sound broke the stillness—a wet, slithering noise that made her stomach churn. Emily's eyes widened in horror as she became painfully aware of something crawling across the tiled floor coming towards her.\n\n She instinctively wanted to move, to flee from the confrontation, but her body felt heavy as dread pooled in her gut. The noise grew louder, a sickening squelch that echoed, reverberating against her skull. Then, emerging from the shadows, she saw it—a grotesque figure, glistening and misshapen, an unborn fetus crawling towards her. Its skin was translucent, the veins pulsing visibly beneath the surface.\n\nEmily wanted to scream, to turn and run, but her body would not allow it, a paralyzing fear taking hold. As it drew closer, its unopened eyes locked onto hers, a deep, haunting gaze that seemed to penetrate her very soul. The room grew colder, the candlelight flickering more violently as if in response to the terror unfolding before her.\n\nThen, in a chilling crescendo, the creature let out a shriek that pierced the silence, a sound that was both otherworldly and heartbreakingly human. “Mommmyyy!” it wailed, the word dripping with a sorrowful accusation that sent a shiver down her spine. “Why?”\n\nEmily's heart raced as she was forced to confront the depths of her actions, the life she had discarded, and the family she had forsaken.  The creature continued to crawl toward her, each movement a haunting reminder of what could have been. \n\nAs she finally found the strength to speak, her voice trembled, barely a whisper, “I—” But before she could finish, the darkness enveloped her, and the walls of the kitchen seemed to close in, leaving only the echo of that heart-wrenching question hanging in the air. The last thing she saw was the glimmering eyes of the being, reflecting her shattered reflection—a mother lost to her own despair.\n\nThe darkness seemed to press in on Emily from all sides, becoming suffocating and oppressive. The weight of her past sins bore down on her like an unbearable burden, each memory a sharp dagger twisting in her heart. She tried to cry out, to beg for forgiveness, but her voice was lost in the maelstrom of emotions that threatened to consume her.\n\nAs the creature drew closer, its form shifting and contorting in ways that defied reason, Emily's mind raced with a tumult of regret and anguish. Images of her husband's betrayed face and her children's tear-streaked cheeks flashed before her eyes, a stark reminder of the pain she had caused. She reached out a trembling hand, desperate to touch the creature, to offer some semblance of comfort in the face of its haunting accusation.\n\nAs Emily's fingers delicately, almost reverently, traced the undulating, pulsating contours of the otherworldly creature's flesh, a profound and unsettling rupture seemed to overtake her senses. In that moment, the very fabric of reality around her splintered and shattered, like fragile glass cracking under immense pressure.\n\nThe world as Emily knew became a kaleidoscope of distorted, fragmented memories, floating images that swirled and danced through the air around her. Shards of recollection and half-remembered moments reflecting and refracting in a dizzying, hallucinatory display. Familiar scenes and faces warped and distorted, as if viewed through a fun-house mirror.\n\nThis sensory onslaught assaulted Emily's consciousness, leaving her struggling to discern the tenuous, ever-shifting boundaries between waking and sleep, between the material world and the realm of pure fantasy. The flow of these surreal visions was dizzying, disorienting - a maelstrom of perceptions that threatened to completely unravel the very foundations of her reality.\n\nJust as quickly as this kaleidoscopic deluge had enveloped her, however, it began to recede, the fragmented impressions fading away, dissolving into an encroaching, all-consuming darkness. A darkness that soon blotted out the tangible world entirely, leaving behind only a familiar, pervasive emptiness - the same yawning, numbing void that Emily had grown all too accustomed to.\n\nWhere vibrant, overwhelming sensations had once threatened to engulf her, there was now only a hollow silence, a complete absence that threatened to swallow her whole. The transition was as sudden as it was disorienting, plunging Emily into a realm of pure nothingness - a state of being that had become all too common in her life, this unwelcome, unsettling void.\n\n[As the primal sensations from her previous harrowing ordeal gradually subsided, Emily found herself adrift in emotional ambiguity](). The relentless march of time had become entirely unmoored; its steady progression rendered imperceptible as she awoke  prone upon a chilled metallic surface. Had mere seconds elapsed since the dissolution of that nightmarish trance, or had an unfathomable eternity transpired in the interim?\n\nBlinking rapidly, Emily's vision slowly became clear, hazy shapes and muted colors gradually cohering out of the initial blackness that had shrouded her senses. Yet this gradual return to perceptual did little to ease the overwhelming uncertainty that gripped her. Was this the much-anticipated restoration of some semblance of objective reality, or merely the onset of yet another hallucinatory vision - a continuation of the hellish phantasmagoria that had so recently engulfed her consciousness?\n\nPanic began to well up within Emily as her eyes darted frantically about the dimly lit room, desperately attempting to decipher whether the traumas she had endured had finally reached their conclusion, or if an even more nightmarish reality now surrounded her.\n\nThe complete lack of clear temporal and spatial anchors was maddening, leaving Emily utterly adrift, unmoored from any fixed point of reference. Just as she dared to entertain the prospect that the worst had passed, a dawning realization crept in: the cessation of one horrific ordeal didn’t guarantee the start of something better. In fact, it could herald the beginning of an even more terrifying nightmare.\n\nHer pulse quickened as she strained to take in the stark, sterile environment around her. The cold, fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows that danced on the walls. Panic threatened to rise as she grappled with the unsettling possibility that her tribulations were far from over. The break she had so desperately craved might prove to be nothing more than a fleeting illusion—a momentary lull before true horror began to unfold.\n\nSuddenly, the sole visible entryway swung open. Emily's eyes widened as she beheld Ezra, but he was not the same. Gone was the grey suit he had worn before. Now, he stood before her in a somber black ensemble, his sleeves rolled up grappling a large toolbox in his hands, moving with a deliberate, almost ominous pace that sent a chill down her spine.\n\nAs he entered the room, he seemed to completely disregard Emily's presence, his attention singularly trained on the task at hand.\n\nWithout so much as a glance in her direction, Ezra strode purposefully towards a table situated behind where she sat, the heavy thud of the toolbox punctuating each of his confident, measured steps. Once he reached the designated surface, he unceremoniously set down his tools, echoing through the oppressive silence that blanketed the space.\n\n\"Where am I? Why are you doing this to me?\" Emily cried out; her voice tinged with rising panic as she struggled futilely against the unseen bonds that held her immobilized her words slurring as they escaped her mouth. Disoriented and overwhelmed with dread, she frantically tried to piece together how she had ended up in this dire predicament.\n\n\"Please, I won't tell anyone, “She pleaded, her desperate tone betraying the profound fear that gripped her. \"Just let me go!\"\n\nBut Ezra remained stoic and unresponsive, his gaze hardened and his features impassive as he continued his methodical movements around the room.\n\nWithout a word, he stepped back and Emily felt the solid surface beneath her beginning to shift. To her horror, the table she was secured to started rising mechanically, lifting her upwards until she found herself face-to-face with Ezra. Staring into his eyes, Emily was struck by how the familiar warm regard she had once found so comforting had been utterly extinguished. Gone was the gentle kindness she had grown accustomed to - in its place was a piercing, unsettling intensity that made her blood run cold.\n\nWhat had once been a source of solace and reassurance had now transformed into the stuff of nightmares. Trapped in this horrific scenario, Emily's racing heartbeat echoed in her ears as a single, haunting question burned in her mind: what unspeakable fate did Ezra now have in store for her?\n\nAs the table continued its slow, ominous ascent, bringing her ever closer to her captor, Emily desperately wracked her brain, trying to find some glimmer of hope, some way to appeal to the man she had once trusted implicitly. Perhaps she could reason with him, appeal to whatever shred of humanity remained. Or maybe, if she could just keep him talking, an opportunity for escape might present itself.\n\nWith a deep, shuddering breath, she strengthened herself and met Ezra's unblinking gaze. \"Ezra, please,\" she began, her voice quivering slightly despite her efforts to sound calm and level-headed. \"I don't understand what's happening here. Just talk to me - tell me what this is all about.”\n\nShe paused, searching his face for any glimmer of recognition, any sign that the man she had known was still in there, somewhere. \"I know you, Ezra. You're a good person - you've always been so kind to me. Please, let's just talk this through.\"\n\nAs the table reached its full height, bringing Emily level with Ezra, she held his gaze, silently pleading for him to see reason, to remember the bond they had once shared. In the tense, unyielding silence that followed, the weight of their history together seemed to hang heavy in the air, a faint glimmer of hope warring with the overwhelming dread that consumed her.\n\n“Those questions are exactly why I can't let you leave,\" Ezra said firmly. \"You didn’t even ask about your family you don’t deserve to see them again. You're not a good person, Emily.” Her initial fear was quickly replaced by an overwhelming sadness as she realized the truth in his words. “I do love my family and I've made mistakes,” she admitted, her voice trembling. “That's why I came here, to try and become a better person. I want to be the mother my children deserve and give my husband the love he needs. And I know what happened with my daughter was a terrible mistake, one that I will regret for the rest of my life.”\n\n She couldn’t hold back the tears any longer as the memories of that night flooded back. “You saw your deepest fears, didn't you?” Ezra asked, remembering the grotesque figure from her nightmare tears started streaming down her face, Emily nodded silently. “If that was all true Emily, when did you confess your attraction to me.”\n\nEzra's footsteps echoed ominously as he approached the weathered wooden table where he had left his worn leather bag. With deliberate slowness, he began extracting various items, the soft rustling sending chills down Emily's spine. Though she couldn't see what he was retrieving, the metallic clinks and scrapes filled her imagination with terrifying possibilities.\n\nAs Ezra moved around the room, his shoes scuffing against the concrete floor, Emily instinctively squeezed her eyes shut. Her heart raced, pounding so loudly in her ears she feared Ezra might hear it. Sweat beaded on her forehead as waves of fear washed over her.\n\nIn a voice as soft and silky as a spider's web, barely above a whisper, Ezra urged, \"Open your eyes, Emily.\" The gentleness in his tone only heightened her dread. Seconds stretched into an eternity as Emily kept her eyes firmly closed, willing herself to wake from this nightmare.\n\nThe silence was shattered as Ezra's voice cut through the air, sharper and more insistent: \"Open your eyes.\" Each word dripped with menace, his patience clearly wearing thin.\n\nStill, Emily resisted, her entire body trembling. Without hesitation this time, Ezra's voice exploded in rage, causing Emily to flinch violently. \"Open your eyes or I'll cut your eyelids off your face!\" he roared, his words reverberating off the walls like a physical blow. The threat hung in the air, as palpable as the acrid scent of fear that permeated the room.\n\nEmily's eyes flew open to find Ezra standing in front of her, holding a framed picture of her husband and daughters and a portable speaker. Fear and confusion overtook her as she asked, “How did you get that photo? What are you going to do with it?” But before Emily could comprehend the situation, Ezra began to speak in a calm, calculated tone. “Let me explain this process to you. When the human body experiences trauma - or in your case, a twisted hallucination - it doesn't just affect the mind. It physically breaks down, as if you were in a horrific car crash. But for you, it's like experiencing 10 crashes at once. Right now, your mental and physical capacities are pushed to their limits. I would ask about your pain, but you're probably numb - dissociating from the horrors of reality.”\n\n As Ezra propped the framed picture and speaker he placed his finger on Emily's forehead, her body froze in a state of catatonia, unable to feel anything except the terror consuming her mind.\n\nA sadistic smile spreads across Ezra's face as he approaches the bound and helpless Emily. With gentle steps, he places a blank CD into the speaker, taunting her with the reminder of their second session. \"Do you remember, Emily?\" He sneers, relishing her fear. \"The one where you confessed to cheating on your husband and betraying your family? You mentioned a song that brought back all the pain and guilt, didn't you? 'Crazy Bitch', I believe it was.\"\n\nHis voice drips with venom as he grabs her chin and forces her to meet his gaze. \"But what you also told me was that without my help, you would have ended it all. That the memories were too much to bear.\" With a sickening grin, he places his hand on top of her head and nods at her, mimicking a yes motion. \"Yes, see, I remember.\" As Emily's eyes widen in terror, Ezra walks behind her and retrieves a roll of tape from his toolbox. With precise movements, he tapes her eyelids open, forcing her to stare at a picture of her family. \"You will not look away,\" he growls in her ear. \"You will be forced to relive your worst sensations over and over again.\"\n\nEzra turned to leave the room, but not before playing the haunting song that Emily couldn't escape. She was trapped, forced to face her family as the lyrics of the devastating song filled her ears. The torture continued for hours, until Ezra offered her a way out. He placed a razor blade in her hands and loosened her restraints just enough to give her some freedom. As he gave her a sinister look, he warned her that she didn't have the strength to survive on her own anymore, since he had been her anchor and now her sanity had sailed away.\n\n\"Don't make too much of a mess,\" he advised before walking out of the room one last time. When he returned, he found a bloodied and chaotic scene. \"crazy bitch,\" Ezra muttered as he began to clean up and restore the controlled aura of the room.\n\n \n\n\n\n "},"17":{"title":"Anyone know any good british narrators?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwntrw\/anyone_know_any_good_british_narrators\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Finnzyy","selftext":"Idk why but i like British accents, used to listen to creepsmcpasta as my go to british narrator but then i learnt about the thing he did so id like to find a new one."},"18":{"title":"Woman in The Woods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwlp13\/woman_in_the_woods\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"313deezy","selftext":"I was seven years old the night I got lost in the woods behind my grandparents' house. It had started as an adventure. I’d heard stories about the deep forest—stories that gave me goosebumps, but I didn’t believe them. Not really. So when dusk came and my cousins dared me to go further into the woods than anyone had ever gone, I took the challenge. I wanted to prove I wasn’t scared.\n\nThe trees loomed high above me, their branches thick and twisted, blocking out the last of the light. I walked further and further, at first with confidence, then with a twinge of doubt. I’d been out there before, but not this deep, not this late. The air grew colder, and my footsteps seemed too loud in the silence. The woods felt alive, like they were watching me.\n\nI told myself I’d turn around soon, but when I finally did, everything looked different. The path I thought I’d followed had vanished. There were no landmarks, no familiar trees. Just endless trunks stretching in every direction.\n\nPanic rose in my chest. I tried to backtrack, but each step only seemed to twist me deeper into the trees. I could hear sounds now—low rustles in the underbrush, the snap of a twig that wasn’t from my own foot. I told myself it was just animals. That’s what it had to be.\n\nBut then I heard a voice.\n\nIt was faint at first, like a whisper carried on the wind. I froze, my heart thudding in my ears. It was a woman's voice, calling out.\n\nThe voice was familiar, but not in a comforting way. It was wrong, somehow. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. I stood there, trembling, waiting for something—anything—to explain what was happening.\n\nThen I saw her.\n\nShe stepped out from behind a tree, tall and thin, dressed in white. Her face was pale, almost glowing in the darkness, and her eyes were wide, too wide. She smiled, but there was something off about it. Something that made my skin crawl.\n\nShe called to me again, her voice sweet and soft, but it didn’t sound right. It echoed unnaturally, as if the trees themselves were repeating it back to me.\n\nI wanted to scream, but the sound was trapped in my throat. I wanted to run, but my feet were glued to the ground. She took a step closer, her long fingers reaching toward me.\n\n“Come with me,” she whispered.\n\nThat’s when I finally broke free. I turned and ran as fast as I could, crashing through the trees, not caring where I was going as long as it was away from her. Branches scratched my face and arms, but I didn’t stop. Her voice followed me, echoing through the trees, getting louder.\n\nFinally, I stumbled into a small clearing, panting and sobbing. I collapsed onto the ground, my heart racing, my body trembling. For a moment, there was only silence.\n\nThen I heard footsteps.\n\nI looked up, expecting to see her again, but instead, it was my grandpa. Relief flooded me, and I rushed to him, tears streaming down my face. He didn’t ask me any questions, didn’t say anything about how I’d gotten so deep into the woods. He just took my hand and led me back home.\n\nI never told anyone what I saw that night. They wouldn’t believe me, anyway. But sometimes, when the wind is just right and the night is quiet, I swear I still hear her voice, calling from the trees.\n\nAnd I’ll never, ever go back into those woods again.\n\n"},"19":{"title":"The Cult That Didn't Break Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fww4e9\/the_cult_that_didnt_break_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"milky_hoopz1983","selftext":"One time when I was young growing up in rural Colorado and about 19 years old at the time this took place in 2004 there was this cult leader who posed as a pastor and taught us about the moral decay of decency and society through his scriptures but conveniently they were burned after his compound was rated but the FBI covered it up along with the state officials because of election season this son of a bitch got away with all sorts of horrible things and if he sees this post I hope he realizes the damage he brought upon his followers.\n\n\nAnyway, Mack was a cunning, manipulative, charismatic, intelligent, and narcissistic leader who spent his days reading his version of the Bible which was just a bunch of cherry-picked verses that didn't make any sense and rewritten the suit his perverse ideology of fear and control, the Apple Friends Society was his brainchild, a twisted cult that drew in the most vulnerable of souls. It was like a black hole of brainwashing and authoritarianism he claimed to be against by posing as a libertarian but he was a cold-hearted fascist and disgusting human being.\n\n\nOnce a woman who was just tending his garden slipped over a rock spraining her ankle Mack just sat there and laughed claiming that she was clumsy because that is what women are meant to be and there is no hope for gender except for the ones who are not possessed by \"Jezebel\" and other demons calling them \"succubi\" and other sexist names because of his inferiority complex or whatever it was probably mommy issues, but I digress.\n\n\nThe cult was obsessed with apples as a symbol of purity because of the whole Eden and the forbidden fruit but Mack had his twisted interpretation where he said that we were the chosen ones to eat the apple of knowledge and be the purest form of humanity before the end of days which is why we were named the Apple Friends Society. We were isolated from the outside world, our phones and computers were taken away, and we were only allowed to read and watch what he deemed \"clean\" and \"pure\" according to him.\n\nAfter our dinners we had apple cake which was his favorite gave the rest of it to his wife Lynette whose family was from Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and South Africa but grew up in the United States she was a beautiful woman with Cuban, Bulgarian, and Slovakian ancestry who cooked our meals and did all of the chores along with the \"tainted clots\" or his term for the outcasts.\n\n\nHe had this bunker with pictures of Lynette everywhere it was eerie. But she was always in the background, never speaking up, just serving him and his needs, I often wondered what kind of hell she went through being married to a maniac like Mack and were told that we were the last Army of True Apple Friends who will rebel against the authority of the United States and of course, we believed his rantings and ravings because we were deeply terrified of this crazed lunatic who said he would escape to South America or take asylum in Cuba.\n\n\nOne day Lynette who was dressed in her tank top with frills, jean shorts, and sandals was tending the garden, and trust me she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my life and was very curvaceous and busty but that didn't matter she was a kind and gentle woman a polar opposite of the monster she married to this day under pretenses and I'm hoping she has a good life.\n\n\nBut this incident changed my view about Mack forever, we were all told to gather around him and Lynette because he had a revelation, she was crying and shaking, and he announced to us that she was pregnant and that the child was a sign from the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies his twisted version of every deity rolled up into one that we were on the right path and that this child was the key to our survival in the coming apocalypse.\n\n\nBut here's the kicker, we weren't allowed to congratulate her or even touch her we were just supposed to nod and go back to our duties, I couldn't believe it, we were treated like robots, and she was treated like a sacred cow, but what got me was that Mack had been sleeping with other women in the cult, the wives of his congregation or lack of a better term, and he was the one that got her pregnant, and everyone knew it but no one talked about it because we were all scared of his wrath, but she had to go through the humiliation of bearing his illegitimate child.\n\n\nMack was a man who liked to control every aspect of our lives, from what we ate to what we wore, to who we talked to and how we talked and had this rulebook that was constantly changing based on his whims, and if you didn't follow it, you were punished with hard labor and sleep deprivation, it was like we were living in a nightmare that never ended, as his followers were told that the world outside was full of sin and temptation, and we were the only ones who could be chosen by the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies who later resembled a demonic and terrifying being of disgusting and depraved acts that would make even the most hardened sinner cringe.\n\n\nThe day came when Lynette gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, but here is the kicker and the gut punch we didn't see or hear any baby let alone medical professionals but we did see liposuction equipment and bottles of weight loss pills which were scattered about sending chills down our spine and this is when I realized we needed to get the hell out of here and Mack was a dangerous narcissist and psychopath manipulating his congregation for sick pleasure.\n\n\nOne night we were afraid about what we saw and compared notes by speaking in code. It was clear, that Lynette had not given birth to a child, but rather, she had been used as a cover for Mack's disgusting rituals as the whispers grew louder among us, and we knew if he found out about our escape and his plans all along we would be punished severely or even killed and the choice was made for us when he started yelling at his wife and breaking everything in a fit of rage.\n\n\nWe gathered in the moonlit night, a small group of the most devoted members who had seen the light, or rather the dark reality of our \"pastor\" and his true evil tide came out so we decided to escape, and we had to act fast, as others had heard rumors of a safe house in the next town, set up by the families and the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies was an idol we later found out was a statue of a man with a head of a bull, sitting cross-legged, and was decorated by what look like tanned animal skin but later it was confirmed that it was far worse than we imagined and we rather keep that to ourselves because the trauma we faced was terrifying and I've never trusted any leader again.\n\n\nSo anyway we just got past security somehow because they were either high or drunk from the weed mixed in with the wine Mack had them consume for his \"cleansing rituals\" and we had no weapons just our determination and a couple of knives from the kitchen that we had managed to sneak out but one of the guards shouted and we had to knock him over the head with a shovel before he sounded the alarm and good thing Mack was in one of his trances.\n\n\nWhen we got out of the compound we were met silently by the FBI who were already tipped off by an anonymous source about Mack's dark secrets, they took us into custody for questioning, separating us into different rooms, the fluorescent lights glaring down like accusations themselves, surprisingly the agents were calm but firm, their faces a mix of concern and skepticism and wanted to know everything, and we were eager to tell them, hoping that this would be the end of our nightmare.\n\n\nMy first thought was Lynette. I hoped she had escaped with us, but she remained behind, a prisoner to her husband's twisted world, as the FBI agents led us away, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for leaving her behind and being taken to a safe house, a simple but welcoming place, far from the shadow of the Apple Friends Society, the walls were plastered with photos and newspaper clippings of missing persons cases, a stark reminder of how easily we could have become statistics.\n\n\nI cried for many days about Lynette and her sweet demeanor as her smile haunted my dreams for many months until I got the call and it was her voice she said, \"When Mack was asleep I crept out of the room to go to the bathroom but knew a secret passageway before I slipped him a 24-hour dosage of sleeping pills putting him on a ventilator and handcuffing him to the bed with everything he's ever done to all of us and called the FBI at first they didn't believe me but when they saw the evidence at the compound they arrested Mack but somehow he escaped when the prison transport was toppled by a roadblock and now he is nowhere to be found!\" and a chill went down my spine and started to question her more about what he was planning to do and she told me that Mack was already heading to his private plane despite the manhunt.\n\n\nThe FBI had been searching for Mack with no luck, they had found the cult's compound filled with disturbing images and artifacts that were linked to ancient sacrificial rituals, and it was clear that we had narrowly escaped something much worse than we could ever imagine, and the news of his escape spread like wildfire, the fear of him coming back was always at the back of our minds, but we had to focus on rebuilding our lives, on healing from the trauma, and on helping the other survivors do the same.\n\n\nLynette and I became good friends and now she is living with me relearning to adjust to the real world and unlearning everything she was told by that monster who is still out there preying on the innocent for his new congregation of Apple Friends, once in a while Lynette still haunted by the horrors of her past, but she's also strong, so much stronger than I ever knew, together, we've decided to use our experiences to help others who've been through the same nightmare, forming a support group for ex-cult members.\n\n\nBut every year on October 9th the day that we met this monster all of us would hold a big party and bake an apple cake that looks like Mack's face and we eat a piece of him to symbolize that we are not afraid of his return and he better not cross our paths because we have each other and the truth on our side, and we will fight back with everything we've got including our strength and will to survive his wrathful and demeaning behavior through manipulation and control.\n\n\nMack if you are reading this I hope you are trembling in fear because the FBI is already after you and right now they are searching everywhere in the world and will stop to nothing until you are caught and brought to justice for what you've done, the world knows your name and your face and soon enough, you'll have nowhere to hide, we are not your pawns anymore, and we will not be silenced by your twisted teachings."},"20":{"title":"I found something strange ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fww19h\/i_found_something_strange\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"thebestjacko1","selftext":"when i was camping with my grandad we put up cameras on trees when we saw the footage we were terrified.

My Dad is called Farmer Murphy, though that's not actually our name. He bought the Murphy Farm, the one hundred and twenty acres of farmland containing two cow barns, a large chicken shed, an orchard, and several fish ponds. Dad makes quite a bit of money working the farm, enough to afford a small army of hands, and we've run about three pumpkin patches already this year. With that kind of money, Dad thought it would be fitting to send me to a private school. Maybe he thought I could get the kind of education that would allow me to be more than a farmer, maybe he thought I would have a head for business and take the farm to new heights, but whatever he had hoped, it didn't leave me a lot of room for making friends.\n\nI'm not an unpersonable person, I don't keep to myself or bully people or anything, but the kids at the private school know my Dad is a farmer, they can smell the cow crap on my boots and they see me work the pumpkin patch when they come to get their jack o lanterns. They laugh at me behind my back, call me Jethro, and think I must be dumb and simple. This leads most of them to shun me or ignore me, and that's about how I've spent the last two months since we moved here.\n\nUntil now, it seems.\n\n\"Uh, yeah,\" I said, looking up from my notebook.\n\n\"Told you,\" said a blond girl. I thought her name might be Rose or Lily or something like that, but the kid who had asked if I lived on Murphy Farm was Derrick. Derick was the one who called me Abner and pretended to smell crap on my boots even when they were clean, \"Well, hey, we were wondering if we could see it. We're really interested in farming, aren't we guys?\"\n\nThere were five of them, two girls and three boys, and they were smiling way too big. Derrick was part of the student council, the girl that was either Lily or Rose and the other girl (Hellen, maybe?) were cheerleaders. The other two were Stan and Guthrie, guys on the football team and pseudo-bullies. They had certainly bullied me enough, though not physically. I was a big guy, too much time spent bucking hay and dragging a hoe, but they didn't mind picking on me.\n\nThis was the most genial conversation we had ever had, actually.\n\n\"Since when?\" I asked, looking between the five of them distrustfully.\n\nDerrick sighed as his smile slipped a little, \"Okay, okay, we really just need someone to say it's okay for us to be out there at dusk. We wanna do the Corn Man Challenge, and your Dad has the only one for about thirty miles.\n\nIt was my turn to roll my eyes, \"You know that's fake, right? There's no real Corn Man.\"\n\n\"Well duh,\" Guthrie said, \"We aren't babies. We just want to do it for TikTok. They've been going viral lately, and we want to see if ours will too.\"\n\nI didn't really do TikTok much, I was usually listening to audiobooks or something on my phone if I was out working in the field, but even I had heard about this one. The Corn Man was an old legend that had blown up recently, and kids were making videos in fields of themselves standing as still as scarecrows while they sang the creepy little song to summon him. He never came, of course, but some of them were supposed to be kind of spooky. The legend said that if you could prove to the Corn Man that you could stand still in the face of his horrible visage then he must grant you a wish, but it was all superstitious nonsense. You might as well ask the milk cow for wishes than some Corn Man.\n\nEven so, though, I supposed maybe I could work this to my advantage.\n\n\"Hmmm, I dunno,\" I said, putting on the hockey accent I sometimes used, \"I'd have to run the tractor when you got done so there wouldn't be any footprints in the corn. The tractor gas is a little expensive,\" I pretended to think about it, \"I couldn't run it for anything less than fifteen bucks a head.\"\n\nThey had their phones out before I even finished, asking for my cash app ID so they could send me the money. I'm not as stupid as they think, and, of course, I have a Cash app. I'd had my eye on a couple of new games and seventy-five dollars would get me a long way toward them. I nodded as the money was received, Derrick actually labeling it tractor gas, and I told them I would meet them at the edge of the east field at five thirty that afternoon.\n\n\"The sun will just be setting then, so it'll give you time to set up before it gets low.\"\n\nThey agreed and as they went away, chattering quietly, I sent out another text, preparing for this evening.\n\nI met them at five-thirty-five that afternoon by the east field, surprised they had known which one to come to.\n\nSometimes city people got turned around.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said, disappearing into the corn, \"It isn't far.\"\n\nDerrick told me to hang on, the girls complaining that they didn't know they would have to wander through the corn. I didn't, just made my way to a spot near the left edge of the field and took a seat on a big rock. The spot was a little weird. No matter what Dad did to it, nothing would grow here. The rock was there to mark it, and as they came out of the corn and saw the little fifteen-by-fifteen-foot spot they started squawking about how it was perfect. One of the girls had a tripod, her Cashapp ID had said Lilyrose so maybe I had been right on both parts, and they set up a phone as they tried to find the right angle.\n\nI just sat on the rock and watched them, looking at the sun as it rode lower and waiting for them to begin.\n\n\"Okay,\" Derrick said, \"Let's all join hands and get started.\"\n\nThe other girl (turned out her name was Heather) pressed something in her hand and they began.\n\n*Corn man, corn man, come to me if you can,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, I can stand as the corn stalks can.*\n\n*Corn man, Corn man, still as stone, not like a man,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, still and quiet as the corn stalks can.*\n\nThey chanted the words then they stood stalk still in the corn field. The plants waved, giving no notice to the five high school kids who stood like statues in their midst. It was silly. Cornstalks didn't stand still at all. Whoever had come up with this story had clearly never spent a lot of time around corn.\n\n\"Nothing's happening,\" Hellen whispered.\n\n\"Give it a minute,\" Derrick whispered back.\n\n\"How long does it take?\" Stan whispered, but before Derreck could answer they heard a rustling sound in the cornfield.\n\nI lay on my rock, staying still, and listened to the rustle of something moving amidst the corn plants.\n\n\"Is that him?\" Lilyrose asked.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Derrick hissed, \"You're supposed to be still.\"\n\nThey stayed there as the sun set, the stalks rustling like insects around them, and suddenly it stepped from the corn like a phantom.\n\nHe was huge, nearly seven feet tall, and he was a mass of burlap sacks and chains. He had an axe in one hand and a cleaver in the other, and the hockey mask over his face made him look grizzly indeed. His boots galumphed with crusty mud, and he swung his head from side to side as he took in the kids standing in the field.\n\n\"It's the Corn Man!\" Derrick shouted, immediately breaking his advice from a moment ago and staggering back a step.\n\n\"You...you said he wasn't real!\" Heather gibbered, breaking into a run.\n\n\"I...I didn't,\" but whatever Derrick did or didn't know was lost as the Corn Man bellowed like a bull and charged them.\n\nThey all broke and ran, the corn shaking as they slammed into it and ran in the direction they had come. No one stayed to get their wish, no one remembered that was why they had come there, and as someone grabbed the camera they knocked the tripod over and did not come back for it. They were yelling and screaming all the way to their car, none of them giving a care for their guide, but I didn't mind.\n\nThe Corn Man swung his head in my direction as I began to laugh, and as he staggered toward me, I clapped my hands slowly.\n\n\"Great job, Travis. You're getting pretty good at this.\"\n\nHe lifted the mask, smiling as he held his burlap-covered hand out for his cut, \"It is pretty fun to watch them city kid pee their pants and run away.\"\n\nI slapped a ten spot into his hand and we headed for the house as Mom rang the bell by the back door, \"After two months of being made fun of and thought of as the Stupid Farm Kid it is pretty nice to watch them get their comeuppance.\"\n\nWe stomped through the corn, the stalks parting easily, and Travis looked at the setting sun unhappily.\n\n\"Hey, cous, you ain't scared the real Corn Man will get mad at you for makin' fun of him, are ya?\"\n\n\"Travis, don't tell me you actually believe in the Corn Man. He's just a story, he isn't real.\"\n\n\"Nu-uh, my Daddy says,\"\n\n\"Travis, your Daddy is a drunk who claims he met Big Foot in Branson Missouri. He is far from a reliable source.\"\n\n\"But he says he believes in him, and that means he has to be real, right?\"\n\nIt was hard to believe, sometimes, that Travis was a year older than I was. Travis was seventeen and HUGE for his age. The local high schools were trying to get him to play Football, same as they did every year, but Travis and Uncle Zeke were our best hands, and Dad really couldn't spare Travis so he could \"Toss a ball around\". Zeke depended on his son's added pay so he could properly pickle himself too, so he didn't push the matter.  \n\n\"Travis, don't believe everything your old man says. Sometimes you have to come up with your own ideas about things, ya know?\"\n\nTravis chewed that over as we came into the barn, leaving his costume in the barn before we went in for dinner.\n\nOkay, so, my early comments may have been a little disingenuous.\n\nI didn't lie, I've always been the big (supposedly) dumb farm kid, at least for the two months I’ve been at this school, but just here recently I've become more approachable by my peers. Derreck and his friends are about the fourth group that has paid for the pleasure of having the shit scared out of them in Dad's cornfield, and I expected they wouldn't be the last. The first group that had approached me had been pure coincidence. Travis had come whistling through the fields as they stood stalk still and they had bolted in fear before he even came out of the corn. After that, I had cut him in, put together a costume, and he blundered into every Corn Man summoning from then on.\n\nIt's not technically a lie. People pay more than what I charge for haunted houses, and I have certainly been cashing in given the time of year. People expect a scare around Halloween, they crave it, and I'm just giving them what they want. I think, deep down, they know there's no Corn Man, but it's the adrenaline rush that draws them in. I'm just providing the ambiance.\n\nDerrick's video went up the next day and did very well. He even tagged Murphy Farm in it, which was nice. He seemed surprised when I was in class the next day, and I had to explain to him that I had stayed still, like you were supposed to, and the Corn Man had gone away. That seemed to work, he nodded as he thought about it, and I went back to my assignment as the rest of the class joked about Derrick and his run-in with the legendary Corn Man.\n\nI got approached by a new group at lunch, four guys from the football team, who wanted to go see this Corn Man too. I told them I would need to run the stalk lifter, something that ran on diesel and was kind of pricey, and they shelled out twenty bucks a head for the privilege of using the field. I laughed to myself, eighty dollars richer, and when a new shadow fell over my lunch, I looked up to find the last person I had expected.\n\n\"Hey, I, uh, heard you can summon the Corn Man. I was hoping I could tag along too.\"\n\nMargery Stokes was not someone I would have thought would fall for all this Corn Man nonsense. Margery was here on an academic scholarship, one of five given every year, and her grades reflected. Like me, however, she wasn't from the usual student background, and the others picked on her. We weren't friends, I don't think we had ever shared so much as a class together, but I did know of her.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"Why, did you want to set up a time?\"\n\n\"I was hopin I could tag along with those guys from earlier. I want to see what there is to this Corn Man thing.\"\n\n\"Well, it's generally twenty dollars a head, but I was mostly just gouging those guys. For you, I'd do ten, just don't tell anyone.\"\n\nShe nodded, reaching into her purse and pulling out a twenty.\n\n\"I can pay. Where and when do I meet you?\"\n\nI slid the twenty into my pocket, respecting her desire for fairness.\n\n\"Six by the east field. It's the one with all the corn in it, you can't miss it.\"\n\nShe told me she would be there and walked quickly off to get her own lunch.\n\nI shot a text to Travis, telling him we had more people looking for the Corn Man and he said he'd be there.\n\nI smiled as I chewed, happy business was so booming, and reflecting it would kind of suck to go back to being the big dumb farm kid once Halloween was over. It would suck, but I wouldn't mind returning to being a nobody either. Having a full social calendar was kind of a pain, and it was only a matter of time before Dad noticed what I was doing and put a stop to it.\n\nUntil then, though, let there be Corn Man.\n\nThe sun was sinking below the corn as a little red hatchback pulled up along the fence line and I saw Margery hop out and adjust her cardigan.\n\n\"Am I late?\" she asked, not seeing anyone else.\n\nAbout that time I heard the exhaust of a large F250 as it came into view and shook my head, \"Nope, looks like you're early.\"\n\nThe four burly football players piled out, giving Margery a questioning side eye, and I told them to follow me as we headed into the corn. They came along noisily, talking and joking as they pushed the corn aside, and when the five of them had come into the field, the biggest one turned and tossed me his phone.\n\n\"You got the recording, right?\"\n\nI nodded and lined up the shot, the four of them laughing as Margery came to join them. They were all very cavalier about the whole thing, but I noticed that Margery was almost shaking with anticipation. She was quiet, almost stoic, and as they took their positions she seemed ready to fight to get what she wanted. I lined up the shot, telling them to start when they wanted, and the five of them began to chant as the corn swallowed the last long line of the sun behind the stalks.\n\n*Corn man, corn man, come to me if you can,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, I can stand as the corn stalks can.*\n\n*Corn man, Corn man, still as stone, not like a man,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, still and quiet as the corn stalks can.*\n\nThe ritual completed, they stood there like statues as they waited for the coming of the Corn Man.\n\nI sat too, holding the phone as I recorded them, and the glowing remains of the sun behind them looked pretty cool. This would definitely make a great video. I hoped they remembered to tag the farm in it, but as I sat there, watching them twitch and glance around, something felt different this time. The crickets were silent, the night birds had gone still, and I was suddenly aware of how absolutely noiseless the world was. It's rare to be in the field at night and hear nothing, and it made me think of something my Dad had told me on a hunting trip once.\n\n\"When the birds and bugs go quiet, it usually means something big is around. Something big and something bad.\"\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief when the corn began to rustle. There he was, I thought, as the stalks shook and the assembled kids began to shudder. He was later than usual, but the big oaf sometimes forgot that he was supposed to be there. Travis could be flaky, but I was glad he hadn't forgotten our arrangement.\n\nWhen the thing broke free of the corn, I knew in an instant that it wasn't Travis.\n\nThis thing was made of cornstalks and roots, its arms were wound together plant fibers, and its legs were thick and muscled with the bulging veins of vegetation. Its face looked like a pagan idol, the features made of delicate silk and weathered cornstalks, and the eyes blazed at the assembled children like the coals of a fire.\n\n\"Holy shit! What the fuck is that?\" one of them shouted, and the thing turned its head to look at him about a second before one of those arms came up and wrapped itself around him. I heard his bones break, his skin tear, and his final horrified screams were cut off as he was torn to pieces. The others ran then, the three football players sprinting into the corn, but I was frozen to the spot on top of my rock. I watched as it went after them, my eyes locked on the bloody remains of the kid whose name I had never bothered to learn, and from the rock, I heard the thing as it caught them. They screamed like trapped animals, their fear and their pain a living thing, but as I looked up, I noticed that someone hadn't run.\n\nMargaret was still there, her cardigan spattered in blood and her face full of terror, but she refused to move. She was stalk still, her chest barely rising, and when I glanced down, I remembered that I was recording. The kid's phone had caught all of it, and as the thing came stomping back, I tried to keep everything in frame so I could prove I'd had no part in this. At least one person had been torn to shreds on my Dad's land, and I was not about to go to prison for some psycho that had been hiding in my East field.\n\nAs it came lumbering out of the field, it looked at Margaret and made its laborious way over to her. To her credit, she never moved, though I could see the tears sliding down her face as they joined the gore there. It stood far taller than it had any right to be, its body blocking the light of the moon as it fell across her, and seemed to judge her with those living coal eyes.\n\n\"You have proven thyself worthy of my boone, child. What do you ask of the Corn Man?\"\n\nHer voice shook only a little, but I still heard it from my rock.\n\n\"Please, my mother has cancer. Cure her, I beg you. She's all I have in this world. Please, take her cancer from her and let her live.\"\n\nThe Corn Man nodded his head slowly, and it sounded like trees bending in the wind, \"Granted,\" he whispered and as he disappeared into the cornfield I could see the red running off him and hear the creak of the stalks as he vanished.  \n\nThe police found the bodies of Trevor Parks, Nathaniel Moore, and Gabriel and Michael Roose in the field that night. Dad was pretty mad when he learned what I had been doing, but the video cleared me of any involvement in the deaths. Travis had, thankfully, been busy in the cowshed with a particularly fussy milk cow and had remembered that he was supposed to be the Corn Man about ten minutes after sunset. He had actually met Margaret and I as we came out of the field, and I had to stop her from screaming as he came lumbering up with half his costume on. The police took the phone and the official report stated that some psycho had been creeping around, found us in the field, and decided to kill everyone but Margaret and I for some reason. Dad forbade me from doing anything like that in the fields again and I agreed, pretty done with anything related to the Corn Man after that.\n\nA couple of days later, after I had been asked about a thousand questions by the police, Margaret came to sit with me at lunch.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, and I was a little confused as to what she was thanking me for.\n\n\"For?\"\n\n\"My mom got the call today. They have to run a bunch of new tests, but the cancer is gone. She had a tumor in her brain the size of my thumb and it's just gone.\"\n\nWe sat in silence after that, neither of us saying it but both of us thinking the same thing.\n\nIt would appear that Margaret had gotten her wish from the Corn Man after all."},"26":{"title":"Found a parody creepypasta about Ocarina of Time","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwn506\/found_a_parody_creepypasta_about_ocarina_of_time\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Balkoth2","selftext":"not sure if this is the right place to post this but found this creepypasta on youtube and thought it was funny so i figured i would share it here   \n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hkIgDmBKjvc](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hkIgDmBKjvc)"},"27":{"title":"Best psychosis\/psychological creepy pastas on YT?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwgs87\/best_psychosispsychological_creepy_pastas_on_yt\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"ariiicuh","selftext":"Looking for the best psychological(unreliable narrator)creepy pastas on YouTube.

It was 2002, and my parents were avid fans of Halloween Horror Nights, attending every year since its inception. While they reveled in the festivities, I was often left at home with my grandparents. Living in Orlando, their absence was only for a night, but this year was different—it would be my first time attending HHN, specifically HHN XII, held at Islands of Adventure. I was excited, as my parents and I often visited the park together.\n\n\n\nAs we arrived at the event, we were handed a map showcasing the various scare zones: Port of Evil, Island Under Siege, Treaks and Foons, JP Extinction, Island of Evil Souls, and Boo-ville. While all of them had their appeal, it was the \"Island Under Siege\" that would leave a lasting mark on me—one that I would remember more as trauma than fun. The scare zone was touted as a villain takeover, and as a comic book nerd, I was thrilled. I had all the issues of \"Maximum Carnage,\" which was also the house theme for this scare zone, leading me to imagine a heroic fight between superheroes and villains. To my dismay, that vision was shattered.\n\n\n\nEntering the queue, I noticed a gigantic, glowing sign announcing the house's name. The line was long, but I remember the pulsating music of Static-X and Powerman 5000 filling the air. Once we finally stepped inside, I was met with a bizarre atmosphere resembling a nuclear reactor. I distinctly recall the scare actor portraying Carnage leaping into my face, heightening my sense of immersion. However, it was soon after that the experience took a turn for the terrifying.\n\n\n\nIn one disturbing room, I saw a nuclear reactor worker possessed by the Caretaker, who was horrifically dumping Iron Fist’s head into a toxic waste barrel, accompanied by unsettling sound effects. This moment deeply unnerved me. Next, I entered a chamber where I spotted Thor, disfigured and entangled in electrical wiring; his costume made it clear who he was despite his ghastly appearance. Afterward, we moved through a vortex tunnel—I can’t quite remember when exactly this happened amid the chaos.\n\n\n\nWhat struck me as the most horrendous sight was in the next room, where a version of Spider-Man lay gruesomely torn apart, his head severed and crushed between two columns. At this point, I was overwhelmed. We then reached the nuclear reactor, and my heart sank even further when I saw Wolverine hung upside down, missing both arms, with his claws painfully skewered into a toxic waste barrel. I could hardly process it all.\n\n\n\nAfter this, I thought we were finally nearing the exit, but instead, we stepped into a final room where we were confronted by a bloodied Captain America, his limbs strung up against the wall, guts spilling out grotesquely. The final horrifying image I can recall is the Punisher wielding a flamethrower. After those vivid and shocking experiences, I sensed something was deeply wrong. We ended our night and headed home around 11 PM—I recall that HHN used to close at midnight back then.\n\n\n\nThe nightmares that followed haunted me for weeks. I couldn't bring myself to attend another HHN event after that fateful night. In subsequent years, I sought solace in online videos and photographs of the house, yet I could only find remnants of what I had experienced, particularly the gruesome fate of Captain America. Rumors suggested that Marvel had become outraged with Universal over the depiction of their characters, resulting in the removal of the bodies and a ban on using Marvel lore again. I theorize that the videos I encountered were recorded after those changes were made, explaining the absence of the shocking elements I vividly remembered.\n\n\n\nI often find myself yearning for closure. With the footage online lacking the clarity I seek, it feels as if my memories will forever remain isolated in a haze of horror, disconnected from the real events of that night."},"29":{"title":"Big Keithy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwg51x\/big_keithy\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"milky_hoopz1983","selftext":"One time when I was getting out of school in 1995 it was December and a winter storm was approaching people started to get ready to leave for the holidays and decided to take a shortcut through the dense, eerie woods surrounding the outskirts of Greitham, Kansas, a quaint town named after an obscure village in the United Kingdom, Big Keithy was a man whose legend was overshadowed by the terrifying folklore that had been whispered among the residents for generations, he was said to be that of an ogre said to prowl the woods, capturing young women and their forcing them to witness his twisted desires and also drugging them with fermented fruit juice and hallucinogens that made them intoxicated and lowered their resistance to his horrific advances.\n\nThe trees loomed over me like silent sentinels as the wind began to howl, carrying with it the distant echoes of what sounded like a woman's muffled cries, which only served to heighten my sense of unease, as I pushed through the underbrush, and stumbled upon a clearing, the snowfall momentarily ceased and the moon peeked through the clouds, illuminating a grisly scene.\n\nBig Keithy was indeed a creature to behold, standing at least fifteen feet tall with a frame that could have been chiseled from the very boulders that littered the landscape, his skin was a sickly pale green, his hair was matted with the sap of trees, his teeth were yellowed but sharp, and his glowing red eyes pierced through your soul when encountering him for the first time leaving an indelible image in my memory forever.\n\nHis clothes were something else consisting of a red and white checkered shirt, dirty overalls, and huge leather boots with rubber soles aligned with spikes on the bottom for stomping and grinding his victims to death if they became confrontational Big Keithy as he an evil creature with no remorse for his actions.\n\nHe had captured a young lady, no older than twenty-two, she had been on her way home from her job at the local diner, her name was Alicia, she was a cheerful girl with the most amazing smile, the kind that could warm the coldest of heart and was struggling against his thick, meaty hands, which were roughly groping and this was my chance for me to get revenge on this monstrosity and abomination. \n\nSuddenly I picked up the largest rock and threw it at him with all my might, hitting him squarely in the back of the head, stunning him momentarily, as an act of defiance allowed Alicia to break free from his grip and sprint towards the safety of the trees as he started to chased after her, my adrenaline pumping, my heart racing as we both heard the enraged roars of Big Keithy thundering behind us.\n\nWe ran through the woods for what felt like hours, the branches of the trees slapping our faces and the snow crunching beneath our feet, the fear of being caught by Big Keithy driving us faster and further into the wilderness, but we could not outrun him, his heavy footsteps and suddenly and stupidly he ran into a tree face first cracking his skull as blood drip down his forehead and collapsed in excruciating pain but that didn't stop him, oh no this enraged this horrifying nightmare as he started roaring with pain and anger. \n\nHe had a taste for human flesh and had been rumored to have eaten the hearts of his victims to gain their strength, and the thought of falling into his clutches was more than anybody could bear including me as Alicia and I managed to evade him that night, but the encounter left us forever scarred.\n\nThe town of Greitham was shocked when we returned, telling our story of Big Keithy's depravity and his hunger for human flesh, many did not believe except for Sheriff Donnelly who tried to hunt down Big Keithy for years but was always unsuccessful, his body was never found, leaving the town to wonder if he was ever truly defeated or if he was still out there, waiting for his next victim.\n\nYears ago, Sheriff Donnelly told us that Big Keithy was a patient who escaped from the Greitham Lunatic Asylum in the early 1960s, a man who had grown to an unnatural size due to a tragic genetic condition, driven mad by his isolation and mistreatment, he had turned to cannibalism to survive and had become a creature of legend in the process and his name was Keith Bennon who was a juvenile delinquent with a penchant for kidnapping and groping women before being sent to this facility dubbing him as \"criminally insane\" and \"a rapist\" who was never to see the light of day again.\n\nThe controversy from Mayor Lionel Sloetzer rumors started to spread that Big Keithy was his son who was born with the same condition and was hidden away from the public eye and when he escaped, the mayor tried to cover it up by labeling him as a mythical creature rather than a human monster, which only added to the horror that had befallen our small town.\n\nI for one will never forget Big Keithy to this day, the woods outside of Greitham are considered off-limits, especially at night, and every December, we hold a vigil in memory of the young women who were said to have been taken by Big Keithy, hoping that their souls have found peace and that his reign of terror will end soon when a group of people become fed up by his actions and decide to take the law into their own hands forming a mob.\n\nThe story of Big Keithy of Greitham, Kansas is one that I will never forget, it's a chilling reminder of the darkness that lurks within the human heart and the lengths to which some will go to satisfy their twisted desires, it's a tale that has been whispered around campfires and passed down through generations, serving as a grim warning to those who dare to venture into the woods alone, especially young women.\n\nBut for me, it's a story that is all too real, a nightmare that I lived and one that haunts me to this day, every time the wind howls and the branches of the trees outside my window scrape against the side of my house, I can't help but think of him, lurking in the shadows, watching and waiting for his next opportunity to strike fear into the hearts of those who dare to forget his existence.\n\nThe legend of Big Keithy may be controversial, but it's one that we all know is true, for those of us who have seen him with our own eyes and felt his breath on our necks, we know that he is not just a story, but a living, breathing embodiment of our deepest fears and darkest secrets."},"30":{"title":"AI Stories ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwbrq6\/ai_stories\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"todderz57","selftext":"Found

These are the events as they transpired, though there will understandably be some paraphrasing, and I've taken the liberty of translating everything into more recognizable terms, since we use quite a bit of shorthand specific to us while actually on operations. \n\nStarting off as any other engagement we've been sent on, we were first given a general road map of risks to look out for. High concentration of hostiles in the area, assume all personnel to be hostile, close quarters combat, hand to hand combat, it was far from out of the ordinary for men who have been dropped into active terrorist situations, though as the saying goes, the devil's in the details. \n\nThey were stressing everything as if we were taking on trained combatants, before explaining that this would be taking place in rural Ohio. Making mistakes in this line of work is impossible, as every piece of information that eventually reaches us has to pass through many hands in advance, but still, most of us asked to confirm this. \n\nReally the only precautions we were given were lower caliber rifles, and hollow point rounds, so our gunfire wouldn't pass right through the surrounding drywall and hit some poor neighbor's dog. The next decision that got push back from us was an updated coms system, the system we'd use to talk amongst ourselves regardless of our relative locations to one another. \n\nWhile our current system was intentionally made to allow sound in, so we could always be fully aware of the situation around us, this was sound proof, both with large layered ear muffs that secured around our ears, and cupped pieces that wrapped around our mouths. \n\nNo matter what grievance we brought up, the headsets were something they really stressed, seemingly avoiding giving us a concrete explanation as to why they were so vital, but restating many times over that they were.\n\nOn our way there, we took a smaller helicopter as opposed to our usual slightly larger carrier style, and our group was only made up of an essential select five, those being a breacher, me, also known as Bull as others have taken to calling me, Fox, our medical assistance, Lapdog, our hostage worker, Lance, and Cheetah, both acting as close range combat support. \n\nOf course these are formal occupations, and other members can for the most part pick up the slack of other members should the situation deem it necessary. The helicopter touched down in a cul-de-sac, issued us out towards our target house, then took off not thirty seconds later. \n\nThough we were out of the street immediately, hugging the shadows of the nearby houses, I would still expect at least one nosey neighbor to stumble out onto their porch in search of a disturbance. Helicopters, in case you don't know, can be very, very loud, especially late at night in a small suburban neighborhood, though still, it was as if no one noticed us, let alone investigated. \n\nIt felt wrong in more ways than one going in deaf to the environment, those sound canceling headsets working well to cut out what was quite clearly an active party in the residence we were about to enter. \n\nIt didn't make sense, it was two in the morning, long after the time anyone in their right mind would sleep, but inside this house, it looked to be bustling, many people dancing about and conversing with nothing out of the ordinary, widely visible through their window. \n\nMost of us stacked up at the front door as Lance turned off towards the side of the house, and Cheetah covering him as he prepared to cut the power. Just as we'd done maybe times before, I pressed my shotgun to the handle of the door, then its connected hinges, blasting out anything that would have held it up. \n\nThis alone would have the average person on the floor, crying and whimpering to whatever God they believed in, but that was before we entered, strapped to the teeth with equipment, magazines, and rifles, all pointing directly at the inhabitants within. \n\nI want you to imagine it for just a moment, you're in your living room, and all within the span of a single breath, your power goes off, right before you hear a series of consecutive pops, and your door gets thrown off its hinges. After this, soldiers storm in, all pointing guns directly between your eyes, ambiently lit by the streetlights and moonlight just outside. Somehow, not one person reacted to us.\n\nIt was eery, made more so by our night vision giving the situation a peculiar green tone. Without any rhyme or reason to, the crowd of people inside the house all continued to dance and converse, as if we weren't there at all. \n\nThey looked to be the most average civilians imaginable, teens and middle aged women, dads with beer guts and kids in hoodies, the kind of people that would yelp over a horror movie, but they didn't so much as blink. It was as if they were hushed in some way, reserved, some part of them held back, as they didn't really talk in the normal sense. \n\nHave you ever seen a kid's movie where everything is comically exaggerated, and every little interaction is posed in a way to get some sort of reaction from an impressionable audience? How every expression is pushed just beyond the point of normalcy, every hand movement they make to punctuate their statements bordering on obnoxious? That's how this was, it felt like they were putting on an act, and poorly mimicking human interactions. \n\nThat is until Lance attempted to secure one of these people. This is a common misconception, when you see a special forces operative pushing someone to the ground and binding their hands, they aren't always detaining them. The point of this is to assure there's no chance that they could go for a gun, or knife when not immediately supervised.\n\nAs Lance finalized this, bumping the back of their knee and pushing them to the ground, every last person turned to us, staring us down with a shared hatred and disgust. That's the thing though, they continued to move, mulling about as if they were talking, congregating into groups and rocking between their feet, but their eyes tracked us from there on out, something that should have been nearly impossible in darkness. \n\nWith a brief talk between us, we decided on positions, Cheetah, myself, and Fox all posting up, lined up on exterior walls while watching the crowd, and choke points so no other member would be attacked, while Lapdog and Lance made their way around, securing people one by one. At first this went off without a hitch, but a creeping feeling overcame me as they did. \n\nIn normal engagements, we would come across one or two people at a time, at most four, and be able to take care of them with full control over the situation quite easily. It was all wrong, fifteen people in that room alone. For the first time in quite a while, I felt truly overwhelmed. I was able to keep my focus outwards though, and I'm glad I did, catching a large man in jeans lumbering right towards Lance before hunching over, and reaching for his headset. \n\nI rushed him, jamming the muzzle of my shotgun against his forehead hard enough to draw blood, a puddle of crimson trickling out across both my hand, and the man's face. It seeped along the bottom edges of his eyes, circling and dispersing into their liquid, and still, he didn't blink. Night vision goggles stood between my eyes and his, and regardless, he perfectly met my gaze, utterly unwavering. \n\n\"Cover me.\" I called, and on que, all our other members pulled back towards the outer walls, and did so. One hiccup, one hiccup was one too many. If that man had a knife, Lance easily could have died, if that man had a little more conviction, or help, he could have overwhelmed him. Never had my adrenaline been so high, not in the face of gunfire, or grenade explosions. \n\nWith the living room down, we moved to the dining room, Cheetah and Lance staying behind to cover an adjoining door and hallway. The next scene was no different than the last, with one resounding exception. People moved around a central table, making their show of interactions between them, the table itself covered in a thin, cheap plastic tablecloth. \n\nNear the head of the table, a large cake was placed, a few sections of it removed with a long flat knife protruding from its surface. Said sections were dotted around on paper plates, and behind the cake, a little girl sat, blood coating her face, neck, arm, and the adjacent walls around her. We had to go about securing the surrounding party attendees, but suffice to say, after that, she became our main focus. \n\nLong red arcs covered much of her, including her cutesy party hat, a dichotomy I wish to never had seen. Soon enough we found out why, rounding the table to a grisly sight. She was in the process of raising, then slamming her hand into the table, her bones thrown so far out of place that they pierced her skin, plainly visible to us. It took all three of us to restrain her, surprising considering her small frame, marking her as the only person to resist. \n\nSeven zip ties was the final count, three across her arms and four along her legs, three times what it would take to immobilize the average person. \n\nThe last places to sweep were the bedrooms, and basement, places we reconvened briefly with Cheetah and Lance beforehand. We would have to move through them once again without them, as they stayed behind to watch the dozens of secured attendees between either room. \n\nLuckily this leg of our journey was unremarkable, as both the bedrooms, and connected closets, and bathrooms were empty, their appearances equally normal, with intermixed paintings and table lamps. Then it was to the basement somewhere some of the most experienced operators can struggle with, due to their generally labyrinthine winding paths cutting between storage shelves, leaving hundreds of places for any would-be attacker to hide. \n\nAgain, our jobs were made easier, as the basement was made up of a solitary room, and bathroom, with a couple of couches pushed up against the walls. It took minutes at most to move through, and the only reason we hadn't gotten out of there quicker was something Lapdog had noticed. It was in a far corner, a border I caught him staring at, completely enthralled by for longer than reasonable. \n\n\"You okay there?\" I questioned, patting his shoulder to try and stir him out of his daze.\n\n\"Do you see that?\"\n\nI looked where he was pointing his rifle, and sure enough, there was a shape. It wasn't solid though, vague enough that I had to unfocus my eyes to get a grasp of it. At first it looked more like a feedback error, some visual static on our night vision, many small green squares that as I moved my head, slowly faded out and in to keep the figure in view. \n\nThere was nothing there, but then again, there was something, some disturbance that our technology was able to capture. I let the squares build for a time, keeping my head locked on the area, and ultimately, a silhouette showed through them. Something was sitting on a large chair, or possibly a throne, reclined with its head propped up on its hand. Its forehead was wrapped with a sort of headband, longer shapes extending from it. \n\nWe stayed there long enough for Fox to take notice, calling on us both to return upstairs. There was one last thing I had to check though, letting Lapdog know before I clicked on my rifle mounted flashlight, turning it back towards the figure. In the same instant I did, it was gone, without any sign it had been there in the first place, never to return, including after I turned my light off. \n\nThe feeling of discomfort I had entered with had grown in my time there, and my goal then was to leave, and hopefully forget about it in the coming weeks.\n\nLapdog and I both silently elected not to tell the other members. \n\nWhat was it? A bio weapon? That could explain the irrational, self detrimental behavior, but our headsets weren't air tight, nor did they have filters, and the average house is also far from sealed. Radiation? That could somewhat explain the errors of technology we had, but then we would have seen some kind of damage to the people there, such as sores or boils. I pondered this as I moved back through the living room, stepping over the motionless, but quite alive bodies of all the attendees.\n\n\"Are we all done here?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Seems like it.\"\n\n\"....Bull? Are we clear to exit? Bull?\"\n\nI heard them calling to me, I could have responded, but I didn't, focused on something else instead. Their microphones were picking up another noise in the room with us, audible just under their voices. At first I believed it to be an attendee, ranting and raving in their binds, but it was melodic, barely a whisper. \n\nI heard instruments along with it, and bouncing reverberating music. The mesh of a nearby speaker was moving, rippling with a fervor that threatened to tear it, but the electricity was off to the entire house? \n\nI tentatively touched it, the song echoing through my body and cascading to my eardrums. It was new to me, but it felt familiar to the point of deja vu, sparking up a memory in the recesses of my mind I didn't know I had. I was in the car with my mom, listening along to the radio as I watched electrical poles pass. \n\n\"I'd discovered I'd been livin life too stressed, the fault of the endless king, the fault of the endless king. I knew then that I wasn't at my best, the fault of the endless king, the fault of the endless king.\" Country, I think it was. It was always a favorite of mine, God I love it. I can feel myself humming along to it now.\n\n\"Bull!\" I was harshly dragged away from the speaker by Fox, his grip on my shoulder tight and urgent. \n\n\"I...I'm here, I'm sorry, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Jesus man, we thought you were having an episode. Are you good?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah....I'm fine.\" I said shakily, blinking the haze out of my eyes and letting focus return to them. One bullet was ever truly fired, one bullet shot throughout the entirety of the engagement, that is of course unless you count the rounds I put into the door initially, that bullet being the one I sent into that speaker. \n\nThat was that. We left, and a group we affectionately call the cleanup crew moved in after us. None of us are sure what they did with those people, but I hope that they gave them the attention they so dearly need. Why am I telling you this, a story that is so clearly classified, a story that otherwise would have never left the informational bounds of the government?\n\nAs a cautionary tale. Pay attention to the songs you listen to, at parties or at home. If one doesn't follow any playlist you had set up previously, if so much as one doesn't align with your predetermined list, cover your ears, and run, especially if they start to talk about a certain king."},"32":{"title":"Are memes allowed here?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fw7gdc\/are_memes_allowed_here\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"TimBitTheTimTam","selftext":"Wanna post one i doodled"},"33":{"title":"Are there any stories you've read as an adult that genuinely scared you?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fw5bkq\/are_there_any_stories_youve_read_as_an_adult_that\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"LakeMcKesson","selftext":"While I still find creepypastas entertaining, very few of them scare me like they did when I was a young teen.

I’m a femboy my male name is Ryan my female name is rose. I came out a few months ago to some friends but some bullies overheard let’s just say’s life has been hell. \n          For some context, I never wear my femboy clothes to school just a shirt and jeans so the only way they could have found out about it is if they over heard me or my friends told them I doubt the second option:3. So these guys pretty much bully me every day bc even tho I don’t wear my clothes to school I still act like a femboys it’s hard not to it makes me happy WvW.\n          It started with just name calling like fagot, bitch, sissy boy, ext. then it turned into being shoved into a locker about twice a week bruising me sometimes and cutting me up from some of the older lockers. I told a teacher and they had given the kids suspensions, the bullies didn’t bully a lot of people so it didn’t take long for them to find out I told on them.\n          It had gotten worse being shoved into lockers everyday sometimes even being punched until I was bleeding out my nose this usually happend in the locker room for gym. I couldn’t tell my parents because they were very homophonic. my older brother had came out transgender a few years ago they kicked him out right away he lived on the streets for awhile and had to drop out of school he is a little better now but resents our parents for obvious reasons I would.\n          I had then decided to ask my friends what I should be they said I should run away so that’s what I decided to do. I packed everything up and left for the road I was gone for a few days but a few days later while I was attempting to sleep in a park a cop had seen me and approached me. I was in my femboys clothes and he had asked me what I was doing out here (I had then noticed that his body cam light wasn’t flashing he had probably turned it off earlier). He asked me where I lived and where my parents I told him everything but as I did this he started to step closer to me I didn’t even notice until it was to late. He had done things to me that I’d rather not say….he had hurt me someone who is supposed to help me hurt me.\n          After he was done he cleaned me up. He then took me to the police station for processing I didn’t speak during that entire time I couldn’t. They had eventually got me home bc a police station from a few towns away had gotten a missing persons case, I fit the description I had gotten home that day. I still had my clothes on when I got home….my parents saw this and had said nothing they continue to say nothing at all to me not a word till now.\n          When I had gotten back to school it got worse they call be a little bitch for running away from my problems they told me to fight so that’s what I decided to do. Days later me and one of the bullies had decided to fight each other at the end of the school day when that hour came and the fight was upon me I was scared. Let’s just say I lost he broke my nose, tore my torso and fractured my jaw. There was blood everywhere I had to go to the hospital for a few days to get treated it took a week or 3 to recover.\n          that happened 3 weeks ago to day my parents let me leave the house today. I had grabbed a rope on my way out I figured the monkey bars at the park would be best this is not the same park btw. At least I learned something when I was In Boy Scouts I can tie a mean knot :3. I’m on top of the bars now with a scarf on, these monkeys bars are pretty high just high enough ig I never mentioned I’m short :3.\n                             Sincerely yours rose\nLove u my friends and family."},"35":{"title":"A fucking troll game...a story by n1ne1nchn@1ls  (im 15 dont judge too hard pls)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwghhx\/a_fucking_troll_gamea_story_by_n1ne1nchn1ls_im_15\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"N1NE1NCHNAI1S","selftext":"But i cant\n\n\nIt was a sunny sunday afternoon.a bit too sunny as i had to close the blinds dimming my room for a while. I was genuinely so fucking bored so why not download some shitty game to review for my horror game themed channel. So i scrolled through gamejolt looking for some garbage exe trash fucking game to review with my lil sis. Her names sam and she was 15. I find a game that catches my eye,Junko enoshima.executable...what the actual fuck. I die laughing thinking \"oh it's probably a parody\" so i download and while waiting i scroll through some videos and re-up on my sis epilepsy meds online...will be delivered in an hour. Great gotta wait an hour and the game was finally downloaded so it was something to do. I called my sis over like \"Hey you wanna play this crappy exe game\" and her bless her heart she went \"Ah sure i like hanging out with you\". I opened the game and it's a literally a rip of the sonic title screen but instead of sonic it was Junko enoshima. Not even the name was changed like this game was so shit fucking hate that game. Anyway back to the story  \nI clicked enter and junkos eyes go bloody as per with the creepypasta game genre. \"Can anyone be creative\" i had thought as it went to the first level.\n\n\n\nLEVEL 1:JUNKO ENOSHIMAs gym experience:\nYou scrolled to the right. that was all that their was. It was a free exe game after all so maybe i was being to harsh so i clicked right and junko went right as per usual. \nThe background was a crappily cropped png of the gym in danganronpa. Once we had gotten to the end of the level there was monokuma waiting with blood red eyes so junko goes near him in the game and the screen goes black right?. Well then it went to level ???\n\n\nLEVEL ???:\nI dont know if i can do this...its fine i need to journal what happened. So the background this time was a shittily cropped picture of fucking jeffrey dahmer. How fucking terrible is that. To use a real tragedy to use in your fucking creepypasta game. At that point i shouldve known something was off. That something wasnt fucking right mother of fuck....My sister makes a comment about how shitty the game is. I continued on,junkos walk animation being non existant. Once we get to the end a message pops up. It had said \"You're too slow\" a reference to sonic.exe or ripped directly from it. I dont know. Then a picture of a...real dead body pops up which i try to shield my sisters eyes from seeing but it was too late. Then it started.\n\n\n\n\nThe truth of the matter:\nYou....You ever know when a shitty games tries to be scary it creates loud sounds. Well this....game.....did that but also started flashing lights to startle....the player. My sisters epilepsy went off and...it hadnt been an hour thirty minutes at most so my sis meds werent here yet...I...I grabbed my sister and rushed to the hospital. She was there for two fucking days two fucking days in a fucking coma cause of a shitty troll game that wanted to be fucking edgy. she didnt make it. She died in a coma with nobody able to comfort her. Its hilarious in the most FUCKED UP WAY. When i got back my computer was still on. A popup was on my computer. The games way of trying to seem scary cause it was \"in my computer\". But just came off taunting. It said and i quote \"you're too slow\" \"you're too slow\" \"You're too FUCKING SLOW\".\n\n\n\nTRACKING:\nI scrambeled onto gamejolt and searched the creators profile. I was so fucking mad. I has lost all train of decency. All i wanted was this bastard to fucking perish in the most fucked up way possible. But then it occured to me it wont bring her back. My sister is dead cause a creator didnt wanna put a warning. So here i am now im about to join my sister now. Once i upload this fucking warning onto the internet. If i could...I would track the creator fucking down....But i cant"},"36":{"title":"Possession?

It's called PiggySoda\n\nThe first video is titled, \"Dog Show\" and shows a person recording a show or VHS of two anthropomorphic dogs fixing a car. This person (who we will call recorder) turns the camera down at their bed and fiddles with a piece of black cardboard, before lifting up the camera at the screen and putting the cardboard in front of the screen and slowly lowering it till we see a dog staring at the recorder through the screen with dark souless eyes, then cutting back to the show.\n\nThe second video is titled \"Dog Nightmares - Childhood Dreams\" and starts with photos of animals in habitats then drawings of that. This goes on over a minute, then it cuts to ain image of two people sitting on a sofa with their faces blurred out. Then we see and image of a girl in a doorway. And there's several drawings of a stairway and one is a photo and has someone just out of camera. Then there's an image of a window, and the screen fades out. There's screen glitches and white screen, then there's a recording which shows someone (supposedly recorder) sorting through the drawings that we saw. In the mess of paper there is a drawing of the dog waving through a window. The recorder points the camera at the window, but it's empty...\n\nBut wait, if you brighten the image of the window, you can make out the pixely outline of the dog.\n\nThe third video is titled \"bite.\" In it, only one of the dogs are fishing, and after the short fishing scene, the screen goes static red and shows a poster of a \"missing dog\" on a tree. The dog doesn't resemble the creature dog, only slight similarities.\n\nThe fourth video is titled \"1\/04\/2009\" and is in a restaurant full of anthro dogs, and a waiter dog taking an order. When the food is delivered, the screen freezes for a second, then glitches, but stops and continues, and the customer dog simply says that they got his order wrong. The screen cuts to a sandwich and that's it.\n\nThe fifth video is titled \"My New Best friend!\" And starts exactly like bite. And the missing dog is named Bailey. A note is recorded and I'll just summarize it. Recorder is receiving calls from people for the dog, but no one has found him. Recorder keeps getting calls from an unknown person and when Recorder picks up, there is just silence. Recorder tried to block the number, but it isn't working. Recorder explains that they hope Bailey got picked up by a shelter, and there's a drawing or more quick sketch of the dog with the words \"I'll find you buddy!\" Also the date written on the note is 01\/29\/09 (I think it's 29). This is a similar date to the last video.\n\nThat's just the beginning and the video is 14 minutes long, and I'm not typing all that for one of the videos. But watch it because it's absolutely crucial to the story. Here's the channel link:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/@DogNightmares?si=8tfRByHWM4JJzCTW\n\nWatched it yet? Good. The sixth video is called \"Bailey\" you know, the dog. A young woman (probably Recorder) is painting a picture of Bailey laying on someone's knee (again, probably Recorders). She just adds details and it has soothing music in the background. That's it, nothing scary, just a nice break.\n\nThe seventh and final video (for now) is titled \"Jack Stauber - Dog Nightmare (DN 10K Special\" It's a music video made with Jack Stauber who is like a dreamcore\/weirdcore music artist who makes cool animations and songs. It's just a music video with pictures and videos from the series. You should take a listen.\n\nNow, a theory is that this dog is an actual creature that made \"friends\" with Recorder as a child, so when she got Bailey, the creature got mad and killed the other dog, and teared down the missing posters as seen in \"My new best friend!\" \n\nAnother is that this creature is an imaginary friend that Recorder made in her childish mind because she was neglected by her mother by being left home alone at a young age and putting her at danger of the \"thing\" at the porch. And maybe it is just \"Dog Nightmares\" about the anthro dogs.\n\nHere's a good video you should watch by Four Plus on YouTube about it. That's where I got the \"Bailey Jealousness\" theory from.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/0E4Sh50f1Vg?si=LwA8H0I4GTjxEf59\n\nThanks for reading, it took really long to write this.

I stood by the window, phone in hand, watching the street below. It looked... normal enough, except for the people moving quickly, heads down, some pulling kids by the hand, others clutching bags like they were in a hurry. There was no panic, just tension, like everyone was running late for something.\n\nI looked at the phone again, hesitating for a moment before dialing. Still no answer. I left another voicemail.\n\n“Mike, it’s me. Call me when you get this, okay?”\n\nI hung up and rubbed my hands over my face. Maybe he was stuck in a meeting. Or maybe the phone lines were jammed. There had been a lot of sirens today. I flicked on the TV for some background noise. The news was on, and the anchor was talking fast, her voice climbing a little higher with each sentence.\n\n“...authorities are urging residents to remain indoors as emergency services deal with... violent incidents... spreading across several neighborhoods...”\n\nI stared at the screen, my thumb frozen on the remote. They were showing shaky footage from a helicopter...people running, cars piled up in the middle of an intersection, a fire burning in the distance. I didn’t understand what I was looking at.\n\nGrabbing my jacket and keys, I shoved them into my pockets. I needed to find Mike. He was supposed to be at work, but with everything going on, who knew where he could be now?\n\nWhen I stepped outside, the heat hit me first. It was the kind of summer day where the air sticks to your skin, and the pavement feels like it’s melting underfoot. But the street was different. There were cars abandoned at odd angles, their doors hanging open, some still running. The city always felt busy, but now it was... quiet. Too quiet for this time of day.\n\nI kept walking. I didn’t know where to start, but standing still wasn’t going to help. Maybe I could catch a bus downtown, or better yet, find a cab. But as I walked, the streets felt more and more wrong. There was trash everywhere: abandoned bags, shoes, broken bottles, and no sign of why people had left in such a rush.\n\nI turned a corner and saw a man sitting against the wall of a store, his head slumped forward. I slowed down, debating whether to ask if he was okay, but I didn’t. Something about the way he was sitting... it didn’t feel right. His clothes were dirty, and there was something about the way his body twitched every few seconds that made me walk faster.\n\nI passed more people as I made my way down the street, some walking in a daze, others looking confused and scared. The city felt like it was on the edge of something, but I couldn’t tell what. Maybe the news had blown things out of proportion. Maybe this wasn’t as bad as it looked. But the sirens hadn’t stopped, and I could hear the dull roar of helicopters overhead.\n\nI turned down a quieter street, trying to think of where Mike might have gone. If he wasn’t at work, maybe he’d tried to get home. It made sense, right? But I hadn’t seen any buses, no cabs, nothing that could help me figure out how to get to him.\n\nThat’s when I heard it. A sound like someone choking or coughing, coming from the alley to my left. I stopped, turning my head toward the noise. I don’t know why I walked closer. Maybe I thought someone needed help, or maybe it was just curiosity.\n\nThere was a man hunched over, facing away from me, his shoulders shaking with every breath. His clothes were torn, and there was something wrong with his skin ..it looked pale, almost gray, like he hadn’t seen the sun in days. I hesitated, wondering if I should say something.\n\n“Hey, are you okay?” I called out.\n\nNo answer. He just kept making that awful, gurgling sound, his whole body jerking with every breath. I took a step back, feeling a tight knot form in my stomach. There was blood smeared on his shirt. Fresh, dark. His fingers twitched as he slowly turned his head toward me, and for the first time, I saw his face.\n\nHis eyes were bloodshot, wide, and his mouth hung open, stained with blood. His lips pulled back in what might have been a snarl. My breath caught in my throat as he took a step toward me, dragging one foot behind him.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nI didn’t stop running until I hit the main road again. The air was filled with the sounds of shouting, distant crashes, and more sirens. I wasn’t the only one running now.. people were everywhere, some pushing past me, others stumbling in confusion. A woman was crying into a payphone, her words lost in the noise.\n\nSomething had happened. Something bad.\n\nI reached for the payphone myself, but the line was dead. No dial tone. No way to call Mike. Panic started to creep up my spine. I needed to get to him. The office wasn’t that far, but with every step, the streets felt less familiar, more dangerous.\n\nBodies lay crumpled on the sidewalks, some moving, some not. I tried not to look too closely at the ones that weren’t. There was no time to stop. I had to keep moving.\n\nI kept running, weaving between the growing crowds and abandoned cars. The smell of smoke filled the air, sharp and acrid, and I could hear shouts from further down the street, people yelling for help or shouting at each other. No one seemed to know what was happening, and the chaos was only getting worse.\n\nMike had to be close. I kept telling myself that. He wouldn’t just disappear, not without calling or trying to get home. But with no buses running, no way to reach him, I felt like I was trapped in some nightmare version of the city I thought I knew.\n\nThe further I went, the worse it got. A man stumbled past me, clutching his arm, blood running between his fingers. His face was pale, eyes wide, like he’d seen something he couldn’t explain. People like him were everywhere now .. bleeding, limping, covered in dirt and blood. Some looked like they were hurt, others... like they’d lost all sense of where they were.\n\nI tried to ignore them, focusing on the street ahead, but every time I looked up, I saw more. Faces I didn’t recognize, all of them blank, lost. It was like the whole city had been turned inside out.\n\nThen I saw someone I knew.\n\nI almost didn’t recognize her at first. Julie, from the café down the street. I’d known her for years, seen her almost every morning on my way to work. She was standing at the corner, her back to me, looking as if she was trying to cross the road. I don’t know why I thought she could help, but seeing her, someone familiar, felt like a lifeline.\n\n“Julie!” I called, pushing through the crowd to reach her. “Julie, it’s me!”\n\nShe didn’t turn around right away, and for a second, I wondered if she’d heard me. I reached out, my hand almost touching her shoulder, when she finally turned.\n\nThe blood drained from my face.\n\nHer eyes were glazed over, distant, like she wasn’t really there. There was dried blood streaking down from her hairline, and her mouth was open just a little, her lips pale and cracked. I took a step back, my heart hammering in my chest.\n\n“Julie?” I whispered, not wanting to believe what I was seeing.\n\nShe just stood there, staring past me, like she didn’t even see me. For a moment, I thought she was dead on her feet. Then she took a step forward, her movements slow, almost mechanical. I took another step back, my hand covering my mouth. She wasn’t okay. None of them were.\n\nI turned and walked away as fast as I could without running, trying to fight the urge to look back. There was no point. Whatever was happening to them, to all of us, was spreading faster than I could keep up with.\n\nI cut through an alley, the noise from the street fading behind me. My legs were aching, and my breath was coming in sharp bursts, but I couldn’t stop. Not yet. Every part of me was screaming to get out, to find Mike, to get somewhere safe. But the deeper I went into the city, the clearer it became that there was no safety here. Not anymore.\n\nI heard the sound of glass breaking up ahead and ducked behind a dumpster, peeking around the corner to see what had caused it. Two men were smashing the windows of a convenience store, pulling cans and bottles from the shelves. One of them was shouting, something about needing food, needing water. His voice was frantic, like he couldn’t believe what was happening.\n\nI stayed low, waiting for them to leave before slipping out onto the street again. My hands were shaking, and every shadow felt like a threat. The city I’d grown up in, the city where I’d built a life, was falling apart right in front of me.\n\nMike was supposed to be at work. That’s where I needed to go next. But as I crossed another empty street, I saw something that made me stop dead in my tracks.\n\nA group of people, at least a dozen of them, stumbling through the intersection. They weren’t running, weren’t even moving with any sense of purpose. They were just walking, their heads down, bodies slouched. And then, one by one, they started to fall.\n\nIt was like watching dominos collapse, each one hitting the pavement with a sickening thud. Some of them didn’t get back up. Others did, dragging themselves across the ground, their limbs moving in ways that weren’t right. My stomach turned. Whatever this was, it was spreading. And fast.\n\nI quickened my pace, the dread building in my chest. Mike had to be close. I couldn’t afford to think about what I’d just seen. He had to be okay. He just had to.\n\nAs I passed a pharmacy, I heard another sound . This one closer. Footsteps, but slow, uneven. I froze. It was the same sound I’d heard earlier, that slow, dragging walk. My heart raced, and I looked for somewhere to hide, ducking behind a row of parked cars. The footsteps grew louder, closer.\n\nI peered around the corner, and that’s when I saw him. A man, his face pale and streaked with blood, limping toward me. His clothes were torn, his mouth open in a silent groan, and his eyes .. those empty, glazed-over eyes locked onto me.\n\nI didn’t wait to see what would happen next. I bolted, running down the street as fast as I could, my legs screaming in protest. I couldn’t stop. Not now. Not ever.\n\nMy lungs burned, but I didn’t slow down. I couldn’t. Every corner I turned, the city seemed to be crumbling faster . People screaming, pushing past me, some bleeding, others already staggering in that slow, unnerving way. The infected. I’d seen enough of them now to know that’s what they were. Whatever this was, it was turning people into something else, something terrifying. I couldn’t think too much about it. All I could focus on was Mike.\n\nI finally reached the street where his office was. Normally, it would be packed with cars and people, business suits and briefcases, but now it looked like a war zone. Windows were shattered, debris littered the ground, and the few people I saw were running, their faces twisted in panic.\n\nMike had to be here. I pushed forward, my eyes scanning the building ahead. The front doors were smashed open, glass everywhere. I stepped carefully over the shards, moving inside. The lobby was empty, eerily quiet except for the hum of broken fluorescent lights.\n\n“Mike?” My voice was hoarse, barely a whisper.\n\nNothing.\n\nI moved through the lobby, heading for the stairs. The elevators were dead, the buttons unlit. I climbed, each step harder than the last, my breath shallow and ragged. I had no idea if Mike was still here, but there was no turning back now.\n\nI reached the floor where Mike’s office was. It was quiet. Too quiet. The door to his office hung open, and for a second, I almost convinced myself that everything would be okay. That I’d walk in, and he’d be sitting at his desk, working like it was just another day. But as I stepped inside, I saw it wasn’t like that at all.\n\nThe room was a mess: papers scattered across the floor, chairs overturned, the desk pushed up against the wall like someone had tried to block the door. My heart pounded in my chest as I took a step forward, my eyes scanning the room. And then I saw it.\n\nBlood. A dark smear of it on the carpet, leading toward the back of the room.\n\nMy stomach dropped. I followed the trail, my hands trembling as I reached the small break room in the back. The door was ajar, and I pushed it open slowly, afraid of what I might find.\n\nThat’s when I saw him.\n\nHe was sitting on the floor, his back against the wall, his head tilted to one side. Mike. Relief surged through me, and I rushed forward, dropping to my knees beside him.\n\n“Mike? Mike, it’s me!”\n\nFor a moment, he didn’t move, and my heart sank. But then he stirred, his head turning slightly toward me. His eyes opened, but they were glazed over, unfocused, like he was struggling to see me.\n\nI grabbed his hand. “Mike, what happened? Are you hurt?”\n\nHis lips parted, and a low, guttural sound escaped him. I froze. That sound .. it wasn’t right. His skin was pale, almost gray, and his clothes were torn, stained with blood. My hands shook as I touched his shoulder, gently turning him toward me. His eyes met mine, and for a brief moment, I thought I saw a flicker of recognition.\n\nBut then his mouth twisted into a snarl.\n\nI stumbled back, my heart pounding in my ears. “Mike?”\n\nHe moved slowly, his body jerking unnaturally as he tried to get to his feet. His hands clawed at the ground, and I saw it then .. the bite. A deep, bloody wound on his arm, the flesh torn and swollen.\n\n“No,” I whispered, backing away. “No, no, no...”\n\nHe was infected. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it, but the truth was undeniable. He was one of them.\n\nTears blurred my vision as I stood up, my back hitting the wall. He was still trying to get to his feet, but his movements were slow, uncoordinated, like he was fighting his own body.\n\nI should’ve run. I knew I should’ve. But I couldn’t leave him. Not like this. I reached for him again, my hands shaking, desperate to pull him back, to make him see me, to make him be him again.\n\n“Mike, please...”\n\nHe looked at me, but it wasn’t him. His eyes were empty, his body moving with a jerky, mindless purpose. The man I knew, the man I loved, was gone.\n\nThat realization hit me like a punch to the gut. Mike was gone. There was no saving him. All I could do now was survive.\n\nI wiped the tears from my face, forcing myself to stand. I backed away slowly, leaving him there in the break room, his groans echoing in the silence.\n\nThe streets outside were worse than when I’d entered. Whatever was happening was spreading fast. People were running, screaming, being chased by the infected. It felt like the city was falling apart around me, and all I could do was keep moving.\n\nI didn’t have a plan anymore. My only goal now was to get out. Get out of the city, get away from this nightmare, and figure out what to do next. But as I moved through the chaos, it became clear that there was no easy way out. The roads were blocked with abandoned cars, and the infected were everywhere, wandering aimlessly or attacking anyone who got too close.\n\nI ducked down alleyways, cutting through back streets, trying to stay out of sight. My mind was numb, the images of Mike, of his glazed-over eyes, burned into my thoughts. I didn’t know how much longer I could keep running.\n\nI reached the edge of the city as night began to fall. The streets were quieter here, less crowded, but the threat was still there. The infected were moving in packs now, their groans filling the air like some horrible chorus.\n\nUp ahead, I saw a barricade . Makeshift, with cars piled up and barbed wire strung between them. It looked like someone had tried to stop the spread, but from the looks of it, they hadn’t been successful. I could hear the faint sound of a radio crackling in the distance, a news report barely audible over the static.\n\n“...the virus has spread to neighboring cities... confirmed cases in multiple states...”\n\nI stopped in my tracks. Multiple states. The outbreak wasn’t just here. It was everywhere.\n\nThe weight of that realization sank in. There was no escape. Not really. No matter how far I ran, the infection would catch up eventually. And even if it didn’t... what kind of world would be left?\n\nI stood there for a moment, watching the infected wander through the streets, aimless, relentless. The city behind me was lost. I’d lost Mike. I’d lost everything. And yet, I was still here. Still standing.\n\nWith a deep breath, I turned away from the barricade and started walking, leaving the city behind. Maybe there was a place out there that hadn’t been touched by this. Maybe there wasn’t. But as long as I was still breathing, I had to try.\n\nI kept walking. Each step felt heavier than the last, but I pushed on, leaving the city’s wreckage behind me. The barricade was far in the distance now, just a jagged silhouette in the dimming twilight. I didn’t know where I was going anymore. The streets were emptier here, quieter. For the first time all day, I could hear myself breathe.\n\nBut no matter how far I walked, that radio broadcast echoed in my head. The virus had spread. To other cities. Other states. Maybe even further. There was no stopping it, no outrunning it. All that hope I had of escaping, of finding safety was a lie. The virus was everywhere.\n\nI came to a stop in the middle of the road. The silence was unsettling, too thick, too final. No sirens. No screams. Nothing. I was alone. And yet, in that moment, something felt off.\n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck prickled, and I felt it before I heard it . A soft shuffling noise behind me. I turned slowly, my heart racing, ready to see another one of the infected limping toward me. But there was nothing. Just the empty street.\n\nThen, a sound. A footstep. Soft, but unmistakable.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nMy voice came out weak, barely more than a whisper, but I regretted it instantly. The silence swallowed the word whole, and I felt my skin crawl.\n\nI took a step back, my eyes scanning the empty street, searching for something, anything. A figure, standing in the distance. Far enough that I couldn’t make out the details, but close enough to see the way they were swaying, their shoulders hunched.\n\nMy heart stopped.\n\nIt looked like Mike.\n\nI blinked hard, my mind racing. It couldn’t be him. I had left him back at the office .. hadn’t I? He’d been bitten. He’d turned. I’d seen it. But as I took another step forward, the figure took a step too, closing the distance.\n\n“Mike?” I whispered, my throat tightening.\n\nThe figure stopped moving, standing still, but just... watching me. My breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t move.\n\n“Mike,” I repeated, louder this time.\n\nAnother step, closer. My hands were shaking, my thoughts spiraling. It wasn’t possible. It couldn’t be him. He was gone. I had left him behind. He couldn’t have followed me.\n\nI swallowed hard and took a cautious step toward the figure. “Is that you?”\n\nSuddenly, the figure collapsed to the ground, crumpling like a puppet with its strings cut. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. What was I thinking? Of course it wasn’t him.\n\nI didn’t want to move any closer. I should have just turned around, kept walking, but something pulled me forward. I had to see.\n\nAs I approached, I could see more clearly now. The figure on the ground wasn’t Mike. It wasn’t anyone I recognized. Just a man, maybe in his thirties, lying face down on the pavement. His clothes were tattered, his body covered in dirt. But it wasn’t the way he looked that made me stop cold.\n\nIt was the bite mark on his arm.\n\nThe same bite. The same infection. Just like Mike. But he wasn’t moving. Not anymore.\n\nI stepped back, my chest tight, a sinking feeling growing in the pit of my stomach. I needed to leave. Now.\n\nBut before I could turn to go, I heard something. A rustling, like paper scraping against the asphalt. It was coming from the man’s hand. He was holding something. A folded piece of paper.\n\nWithout thinking, I reached down, prying the note from his stiff fingers. My hands trembled as I unfolded it. The writing was smeared, shaky, but I could still make out the words. It was short. Just one sentence.\n\n*It’s in the air...*\n\nThe realization hit me like a hammer to the chest, stealing the breath from my lungs. My heart faltered, pounding so hard I thought it might burst. Panic clawed at my throat, and I looked around wildly, desperate for any sign of escape. I looked around, panic rising in my throat.\n\nThe infected weren’t following me. They were ahead of me. Waiting.\n\nI turned to leave, but before I could take a step, I saw another figure. Then another. Emerging from the shadows of the buildings around me. Moving slowly, but deliberately.\n\nI stopped in my tracks, my breath coming in shallow gasps. The figures around me closed in, their faces blank, but not aggressive. They weren’t going to chase me. They didn’t need to.\n\nMy head had been pounding since earlier, but now it felt like my thoughts were slipping, fading.\n\nI touched my face, feeling the slick sweat on my skin, the heat rising in my body. The fever. It had started hours ago, but I hadn’t realized it. I thought I was running from the infection, but I was already too late.\n\nI felt it then. The change. A subtle shift inside me, like something crawling under my skin, taking hold. My breath came ragged, my legs weak. The figures stood still, watching me. Waiting.\n\nAnd then, I understood.\n\nI wasn’t escaping.\n\nI was already [one of them](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1sPb8VArLIA)."},"40":{"title":"The Vanishing of the Sodder Children","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fwcksr\/the_vanishing_of_the_sodder_children\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the chilling tale of the Sodder children and their mysterious disappearance on Christmas Eve.

The blood moon hung low in the sky, its eerie luminescence casting an unsettling glow over the landscape. I’d grown up hearing the stories about the Hanging Tree, a gnarled, ancient oak at the edge of Kyle’s Meadow, just a few miles outside of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. On nights like this, when the moon turned crimson, people whispered that the spirits of the damned would rise from the dead and roam the earth, seeking souls to steal and revenge to wreak.\n\nGrowing up, I dismissed those stories as mere folklore, the stuff of scared little kids needing something to thrill them. But as I pulled into the gravel parking lot of the old meadow, I felt a chill crawl up my spine that I couldn’t shake off. I parked the truck and stepped out, the cool night air wrapping around me like a shroud. I recalled the first time I’d heard about the Hanging Tree, from my grandfather’s quivering lips as he recounted the legend like it was a history lesson rather than a ghost story.\n\n“On nights of the blood moon,” he’d said, “the spirits rise to reclaim what was taken from them. If you hear them whispering your name, don’t look back. Just run.”\n\nAt the time, I rolled my eyes, but a part of me had feared the darkness anyway. Tonight, as I stood in the shadows of the looming tree, I was not so sure.\n\nI could barely make out the silhouette of the tree, its branches twisting and curling against the glowing moon. As I approached, the sight sent shivers down my spine. A thick rope hung from one of the branches, swaying slightly, as if beckoning me closer. It had been years since anyone had dared to approach it, at least, that was the rumor.\n\nPeople in town spoke of the tree in hushed tones—how it had been used to execute those who challenged the law or disobeyed God's will. Some locals claimed it was cursed, and others spoke of the ones who had met their ends there. Each time the blood moon returned, they said, the bodies would drop to the ground and rise again, forced to walk the earth as the living dead.\n\nI hesitated before stepping closer, half in curiosity, half in deep-seated fear. That’s when I noticed something on the ground—a shadow moving just outside the area illuminated by my headlights. My heart raced as the shape stepped into the light. A figure, pale and gaunt, clothes tattered and stained with earthy grime, emerged from the darkness. Its eyes were hollow, sunken like the bottom of a well, and a mouth stretched into a parched grin, revealing teeth that looked like they belonged in a mausoleum.\n\nThe legends were true—it was one of the damned.\n\nBefore I could scream, it opened its mouth and growled my name in a voice so raw and hoarse, it sent ice coursing through my veins. I stumbled back, slamming into the tree, the rough bark scraping against my skin. But then, as if waking from a dreadful dream, I looked back to where the figure had been, and it was gone—vanished into the night.\n\nBut something else caught my eye. Underneath the tree, I saw remnants of the past: the scattered, tattered clothes of the condemned. Their remains whispered to me in the wind, stories of injustices and pain—their torments echoing through the vast, empty fields. Suddenly, my bravado melted away, and I understood. These were the spirits bound to this tree, fated to rise each blood moon and haunt the living.\n\nThe air shattered with low, mournful cries, filling meine senses with dread. The stories had never warned of how it felt—the absolute sorrow of the lost. I was seized with a desperate urge to flee, but before I could turn, I heard a crack from above. Glancing upward, I saw shadows spilling from the branches, and gasped in horror as they began to drop, one by one, onto the ground.\n\nThe moon shone brighter, illuminating more figures as they unfurled themselves—some clutching their throats, others flailing their arms about as if in torment. They rose, standing awkwardly at first, their movements wrought with anguish. Then, like a surge of wind, the dead began to move, their erratic dance morphing into a unified horde.\n\nI was frozen in fear, my heart pounding like the relentless rolling thunder. As if catching the scent of life, they turned toward me. Their sunken eyes glistened with malice; their expressions were twisted, half-remembered rage. Suddenly, the whispering began again—multiple voices, layered and overlapping, each one clawing at my sanity.\n\n“Join us… We seek the living… Join us…”\n\nI turned to run, but the moment I did, I felt cool fingers brush against my shoulder—they were here. The spirits of the dead had risen, and they were hungry. I bolted towards my truck, my muscles screaming in protest as I sprinted through the meadow, the sound of heavy, dragging footsteps echoing behind me.\n\nI could hear their labored breathing, the rustle of leaves as they converged around me. I threw myself into the truck, fumbling for the keys in a panic, my breath quickening as I dared to look back. They were all around, their faces distorted with anger and misery. Just as I twisted the key, I felt icy hands grip the frame of my window, pulling, begging, cursed souls who once were.\n\nWith a roar, the engine came alive, and I hit the gas, peeling out of the gravel lot, the speed carrying me away from the horror—but not for long. The spirits pursued, threading through the trees and fields like the wind, their wails growing louder, more insistent. I glanced in the rearview mirror, and the sight struck terror straight into my heart.\n\nDozens of gore-covered figures surged after me, their dark, hollow eyes fixed on me. The blood moon shone wickedly, illuminating their fury. Screams and whispers melded into a cacophony that chased me through the winding roads back to the safety of town.\n\nI reached Pawhuska and didn’t stop until I screeched to a halt at the gas station before burying my head in my hands, trying desperately to block out what I had seen. But as I looked up, I noticed something chilling—the townspeople were watching me with eyes wide in fear and disbelief. I got out of the truck, but the moment I saw them, the cries returned, swelling in my ears, my mind unraveling with dread.\n\nI stumbled back, afraid that the dead would come for all of us. Just then, a siren wailed in the distance, startling everyone. The sound pierced the horror, urging the town to wake from this nightmare. The police car pulled around the corner, stopping just outside the convenience store.\n\n“What’s going on?” an officer asked, his voice steady but eyes darting with uncertainty.\n\nI opened my mouth to scream, to tell them about the tree and the spirits, but as I processed the horror, the truth settled in. They wouldn’t believe me. They never did. That’s how it always went; legends were just that—stories too wild to comprehend. The folklore about the Hanging Tree only fed to the superstitions of the town. What could I possibly say that would make them share my fear?\n\nThat night, I didn’t sleep, the voices echoing in my mind like a terrible music box playing a dirge. The dead had followed me from Kyle’s Meadow, their breath hissing like molten ash. The police would regard my plight as the delirium of a fearful mind. They would not understand I had seen—and worse, I had awakened the wrath of the hung souls buried under the weight of their sorrow."},"44":{"title":"What's Your Favorite Creepypasta Story?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvgj35\/whats_your_favorite_creepypasta_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Zealousideal-Big3683","selftext":"Comment you favorite Creepypasta story!

Aimee has Raven Black hair and Amber eyes, she had free time and decided she wanted to go with some of her friends to a frozen pond not far from her house to skate, it tends to be a popular spot. Aimee drank coffee with pumpkin spice creamer to get ready for the cold. The night before she had a horrific nightmare. She saw kind of Ghost Princess or Evil Witch with a blue and white blade, she was backed into the corner of her room. The demon lady was pale as snow with very long black hair, could also be described as a vampire, Aimee wasn't sure. In her dream Aimee screamed as the Succubus came closer and paused with a smile before violently piercing her chest with the large sword, Aimee woke up screaming at that point. \n\nAimee was the superstitious type, she thought her dreams meant something related to reality and believed they can tell things about the future. She felt frightened and couldn't get the images of the dream out of her mind. Aimee called Kyla and Samariah to go to that pond of ice and skate. They all met and walked to the pond. Dressed in winter clothing, they talked about regular old girl stuff. Aimee decided not to talk about her nightmare because she didnt want to ruin the mood. Kyla has mousey brown hair, Samariah is a pretty blonde. When they got to the pond they saw others skating as well. They put on their skates and were having fun. Aimee was doing spinning moves she has seen in figure skating, humorous dancing. They laughed and were having lots of fun. Samariah fell once and Kyla helped her up. After a while they got tired and went to sit by the side of the pond. \n\nThey then noticed Lisa Anne, a girl they went to high school with years ago was there. Lisa Ann was the Queen Bee, typical high school mean girl. All 3 girls had a bad taste in the mouth. Lisa Anne always used to insult people about their apperance and spread rumors, both true and false. Aimee said \"well that is something I didn't want to see\", Kyla: \"Tell me about it\". They tried to continue with their ice skating despite the elephant in the room. Lisa Anne used a blade to cut a hole into the ice, no one really noticed her. Aimee went towards it and fell right in. She felt so cold and tried to rush up but was pushed back in to the water and she held her still into the dark water. Samariah and Kyla lost sight of her in the crowd. Lisa Anne smiled as Aimee struggled trying to reach the surface, after seconds she passed out and was sinking deeper.\n\nSamariah: \" Where is Aimee ?\", Kyla didn't have an answer, little did she know Aimee's lifeless body was below her. Lisa Anne left the area. Samariah was extremely worried because Aimee was nowhere in sight, she told Kyla to come with her and go look for her. Kyla said she is probably fine, she just went to a resturaunt, Kyla: \"you know she has a sweet tooth, I am staying here, I'm tired\". Samariah \"Aimee wont pick up her phone, this might be serious\". Kyla: \"mabey she forgot it\". Samariah: \"she isn't the forgetful type\", she walked off to look for her. Kyla called someone on her phone, \"you did a great job, all went as planned\"."},"47":{"title":"The Ballad of North Carolina Highway 17","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvzm0g\/the_ballad_of_north_carolina_highway_17\/","flair":"Iconpasta Story","author":"Pickles_O-Malley","selftext":"Title: The Ballad of N.C.

We were stunned.\n\nDriven by curiosity, we began to defrost her, expecting nothing more than a lifeless corpse to study. But she breathed. Her chest rose and fell as if the thousands of years trapped in ice meant nothing. I watched in disbelief as her eyes opened—dark, vacant pools that seemed to peer into a world I couldn’t understand.\n\nShe tried to speak, but the language was foreign, ancient. Her voice was weak, her movements slow. We didn’t know what to do except continue thawing her. But soon, something far worse came to light—she wasn’t just alive. She was pregnant.\n\nHer belly swelled as warmth returned to her body, and within hours she was writhing in agony, her hands clutching at her abdomen. We couldn’t communicate, couldn’t comfort her, but the urgency was undeniable. She was in labor.\n\nI’ll never forget the birth—the blood, thick and dark, pouring from her as her screams grew louder, filling the small lab. Her eyes never left mine, wide and full of some twisted knowing.

It was as if she had always known what she carried within her, something ancient and malevolent.\n\nThe creature grew rapidly, its twisted form becoming more grotesque with each passing second. It turned on one of my colleagues before we even had a chance to act—tearing into him with claws sharper than any blade. His screams cut through me as blood sprayed the walls, and the creature fed.\n\nWe tried everything—bullets, fire—but nothing worked. It was as if the creature wasn’t truly physical, something that belonged more to the darkness than to our world. It grew stronger, feeding on us, one by one.\n\nNow, I’m alone. The woman’s laughter still rings in my ears, even though her body decayed into dust the moment the creature emerged. The air is thick with death, the stench almost unbearable.

It was supposed to be just one night—a dare from some of the kids at school. Stay the night in the old Craven house, the one with the broken windows and peeling paint, and you'd be a legend. It sounded easy enough during the day, but now, in the dead of night, every instinct in my body screamed for me to run.\n\nI pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The floorboards groaned beneath my feet, and the air smelled of mildew and rot. My flashlight's beam flickered as I glanced around, my heart racing in my chest. Shadows danced on the walls, and the silence of the house felt heavy, almost oppressive.\n\n\"Just one night,\" I whispered to myself. \"It’s just a stupid dare.\"\n\nI made my way into the living room, where an old fireplace sat unused, its stone facade cracked and crumbling. I set my bag down and unrolled my sleeping bag on the dusty floor. The air was colder inside than it had been outside, and I shivered, pulling my jacket tighter around me. The stories I’d heard about this place—about people who had vanished, about strange creatures that lived in the walls—started to creep back into my mind.\n\nI shook my head. “It’s just stories.”\n\nAs I sat down, trying to calm my nerves, I heard it—a low, guttural noise. My heart skipped a beat. I shone my flashlight toward the hallway, where the sound had come from. The beam trembled as I held it, waiting.\n\nNothing.\n\nI took a deep breath, telling myself it was just my imagination. Then, the noise came again, closer this time—like something breathing, wheezing, just around the corner. I scrambled to my feet, my hands shaking as I aimed the flashlight toward the source. The light landed on a pair of glowing eyes staring back at me from the darkness.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. The creature, whatever it was, slunk into the light. Its skin was pale, almost translucent, and it was hunched over, its limbs long and twisted. It grinned at me, revealing rows of sharp, jagged teeth.\n\nBefore I could react, something cold wrapped around my ankle. I looked down and saw a long, bony hand emerging from beneath the floorboards, its fingers digging into my skin. I screamed, kicking at it, but it only tightened its grip, pulling me toward the gaping hole that had opened in the floor.\n\nI clawed at the ground, my flashlight rolling away as I was dragged closer and closer to the darkness beneath the floor. The creature with the glowing eyes watched, amused, as I struggled. Just as I thought I’d be pulled under completely, the hand released me, vanishing as quickly as it had appeared.\n\nI scrambled backward, breathing hard, and backed myself against the wall. My ankle throbbed where the hand had gripped me, and I could feel the indentations it had left in my skin. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what had just happened.\n\nBut there was no time to think. The walls around me began to shake, and I heard the sound of skittering—hundreds of tiny claws, moving within the walls. I stood up, pressing my back to the cold surface, my heart pounding. I could feel them now—things crawling just behind the wallpaper, scratching at the plaster as if trying to get out.\n\nThen, they did. The walls began to crack, thin lines spider-webbing out until holes started to form. From those holes, small, grotesque creatures began to emerge. They were rat-like, but larger, with deformed faces and sharp teeth. They squealed as they scurried out, their beady eyes locked on me.\n\nI ran. I didn’t care where, I just needed to get away. My feet pounded against the floor as I dashed through the house, but everywhere I turned, they were there—more creatures, more horrors waiting in the shadows.\n\nI burst into a room at the back of the house and slammed the door shut behind me. My breath came in short, panicked gasps. There was no way out; the windows were boarded up tight. I was trapped.\n\nSuddenly, the door began to creak as something pushed against it from the other side. I pressed my back against it, trying to keep whatever was out there from getting in, but it was no use. The door flung open, knocking me to the ground.\n\nI looked up and saw the first creature—the one with the glowing eyes—looming over me. It grinned again, but this time, its mouth was wider, its teeth impossibly long.\n\n\"Why?\" I managed to choke out, as it crouched closer.\n\nIts voice was like nails on a chalkboard as it spoke. \"We like to play.\"\n\nBefore I could scream, it lunged at me, its hands wrapping around my throat. My vision blurred, my breath cut off. I kicked and flailed, but it was stronger than I could ever be. My world started to fade to black.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it had started, the pressure was gone. I gasped for air, my chest heaving as I looked around.\n\nThe creatures were gone. The house was still again. The only sound was my ragged breathing and the distant, fading sound of their laughter.\n\nI don’t remember how I got out of that house. One moment, I was lying on the floor, and the next, I was stumbling through the front door, collapsing on the overgrown lawn outside.\n\nI never spoke of what happened that night. When the other kids asked, I just shrugged and said it was no big deal. But every now and then, I catch myself looking over my shoulder, wondering if those creatures are still watching, waiting for another chance to play.\n\nOne thing is for sure—I’ll never go near that house again.\n\n"},"50":{"title":"What creepypasta has tiptoe through the tulips?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvmycj\/what_creepypasta_has_tiptoe_through_the_tulips\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Pale_Eagle5598","selftext":"Self explanatory :"},"51":{"title":"Enderman creepypasta ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvr5rd\/enderman_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"countjj","selftext":"I’m trying to find an old Minecraft creepypasta about an enderman, does anyone remember a creepypasta, taking place in beta 1.8 (version the enderman was added ) where an enderman stalked a player, that was holding heads of his friends.

I have no idea what that means, but this machine has been built to test the percentage of chances of reproduction. It's such a popular machine and it will tell you out of 100, what percentage you are at, at the chance of reproduction. So a rich man's chances of reproduction will be at 85% while a poor man's chances at reproduction will be at 40%. It does it for both women and men, and people take it so seriously. Nearly everyone wants to reproduce. \n\nSo you can do things to improve yourself and the machine will give you a higher percentage of chances of reproduction. Some people are so addicted at knowing the percentage of their chances at reproduction. Then one day the machine was giving really high percentage at chances of reproduction to people who were homeless, druggies and people with mental health problems. It was a weird revelation and now nearly everyone wanted to be like them, as everyone wants a high percentage at reproduction. The machine kept giving more unlikely candidates high percentages at reproduction. \n\nThen the machine started to give high percentages to people of severe disabilities and victims of acid attacks or fire burn victims. People started to do all sort of things to themselves so that they could have a high percentage at reproduction. People turned towards drugs, became homeless and even badly injured themselves to higher their chances at reproduction. It was crazy and when I looked at the machine it kept saying that I was a white man pretending to be a white man. I honestly didn't know what the machine meant by that, because how could I be pretending to be a white man when I was already a white man? \n\nThen the machine started to give higher percentages of chances of reproduction to newly dead people, who were killed in a gruesome sort of way. That instantly made things worse when there was an increase of people messing with gangs and criminals, in the hopes that they will be killed in a gruesome way to higher their chances at reproduction. This was all crazy and it didn't make sense but people listened to the reproduction machine than they did towards the medical machine. Everyone wants to be a sex symbol and the machine kept telling me that I am a white man pretending to be a white man. \n\nThen after a year, my town was in utter ruins because of what the reproduction machine had told people, at what would increase their chances of reproduction. The machine started laughing and I then knew that it gave them wrong information on purpose to destroy our town. \n\nIt then said to me \"now you are white, as white as a ghost at realising what my evil plan was all along\" \n"},"53":{"title":"The Dark Origins of the Smurfs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvpccr\/the_dark_origins_of_the_smurfs\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"milky_hoopz1983","selftext":"Let me share with you an eerie revelation about the true inspiration behind \"The Smurfs\" a seemingly innocent children's show that has been lurking in the shadows for a long time as they were not of this earth and then yet manipulated their original storyteller.\n\nThe quaint, pastel-colored world of the Smurfs that we were so fondly accustomed to in our youth was, in reality, a chilling allegory for a much darker truth, a tale that stretches back through the annals of history, a story so disturbing that it was whitewashed and sanitized to be palatable for a younger audience and its original concept was born from the twisted imagination of a reclusive Belgian cartoonist named Pierre Culliford, or Peyo, as he was known in the art world, haunted by his experiences during the Second World War, had stumbled upon a set of ancient documents that spoke of a terrifying race of beings that once dwelt in the dense forests of the Ardennes.\n\nThese creatures, known as the Schtroumpfs, were not the cheerful, blue inhabitants of our cartoon lore and were, instead, a species that bore an unsettling resemblance to humans, yet with grotesque, exaggerated features that sent shivers down the spine, and skin was a sickly pallor, and their eyes held an eerie, vacant stare that seemed to peer into one's soul, the Schtroumpfs were said to be a cursed tribe, forced to live in isolation due to their horrific appearances, which were the result of a dark pact they made with an ancient, malevolent force to escape persecution.\n\nTheir village, much like the one we saw on our TV screens, was meticulously constructed. However, the mushroom houses were not a whimsical choice of architecture but rather a grim necessity and the Schtroumpfs had a deep-seated phobia of enclosed spaces, a reminder of the cages they had once been held in by those who sought to exploit their unique abilities included an uncanny knack for alchemy and a chilling power to manipulate the very fabric of reality.\n\nTheir leader, Gargamel, was not the bumbling, comical antagonist we knew him to be. In the dark annals of history, he was a figure feared by the Schtroumpfs and humans alike fighting against a tyrant and powerful sorcerer with a vendetta, Gargamel sought to harness the Schtroumpfs and their powers for his nefarious purposes, had he not been driven mad by his obsession and was known to perform gruesome experiments on the captured creatures to unlock their secret transformation of his face was a testament to his dark practices, a side effect of his dabbling in the forbidden arts.\n\nThe Smurfs, as they were later named, lived in a constant state of fear, hiding from Gargamel and his cat, Azrael, as the cartoon's light-hearted adventures were, in fact, a macabre dance of survival, the laughter that filled the air was a desperate facade, a coping mechanism for the horrors that lurked just beyond their mushroom-covered sanctuary.\n\nThe story of the Smurfs is a tragic one, filled with loss and despair with characters we knew as friends were survivors of a catastrophe they endured before World War II, a reminder of the dark times that humanity had tried to erase, each of them had a backstory shrouded in pain and suffering, their names a silent tribute to those who were lost in the conflict with Gargamel.\n\nAnd what of the Smurfs and their creator, Peyo? \n\nHe was said to have been haunted by his discovery, plagued by nightmares and an overwhelming sense of guilt, and the decision to rebrand the Schtroumpfs as a children's show was a desperate attempt to warn the world of the darkness that lay hidden in plain sight, while simultaneously ensuring that the memories of his friends remained pure and unsullied.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Belgium, the Schtroumpfs became aggressive and started to take matters into their own hands by forming a clandestine resistance, sabotaging Nazi operations, and aiding the Allied forces with cunning and stealth earned them the admiration of the locals, who whispered tales of their heroism through the years. But with freedom came a new terror—the fear of discovery.\n\nOne time a few of them attacked a bunch of Nazis and did the unthinkable by eating them that is why when the villagers started to view them as monsters and not saviors horrors of the war had twisted them, and they could no longer live in harmony with humans, they retreated deeper into the woods, their existence becoming a mere legend whispered around campfires.\n\nPeyo, who had witnessed these events firsthand, was torn between admiration for their bravery and horror at their actions felt a moral obligation to share their story but knew it would be misunderstood by the world still healing from the war's atrocities, \"The Smurfs\" was born, a sanitized version of a much darker truth, a beacon of hope and friendship amidst a backdrop of fear and pain.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Smurfs and their origin lies in the fact that this dark past has been buried beneath layers of commercialization and child-friendly storytelling and a testament to the human capacity to sanitize and commodify even the most harrowing of histories, the real story of the Schtroumpfs is one of survival, resilience, and the lengths to which a species will go to preserve itself in the face of unspeakable evil.\n\nWhen the Schtroumpfs were rediscovered by the Belgian authorities in 1973 they resisted by using their alchemical prowess to create illusions and decoys, confusing their would-be captors and ensuring their survival and the government, fearful of the chaos that would ensue if the truth about these beings were revealed, decided to keep their existence a secret, allowing them to live in the forests undisturbed.\n\nAs the anthropologists and biologists set foot in the Schtroumpf Lands in the 1980s they were struck by the profound intelligence of the creatures, who had developed a complex society, language, and even a form of government despite their isolation. But their studies were cut short by the Schtroumpfs and the consequences of doing such.\n\nIn a tragic twist, the Schtroumpfs, who had once been so eager to help humanity, had grown distrustful and hostile towards outsiders, their experiences with Gargamel and the horrors of war had left them jaded and suspicious, and they could not bear the thought of being misunderstood or exploited once again, and so they chose to vanish from the annals of science, leaving only the whimsical cartoon to tell a watered-down version of their story.\n\nA grisly sight was beheld with piles of human bones and other remains scattered around, it was clear that the Schtroumpfs had not abandoned their fierce defense mechanisms and had resorted to cannibalism to protect themselves from those who sought to do them harm and the controversy surrounding the Smurfs does not end with their origin story, it extends into the realm of their psychological and societal impact because of their cannibalistic and feral nature, the very essence of their being was a stark reminder of the primal instincts that lurk within all of us, the capacity for violence and the lengths we will go to protect those we hold dear.\n\nBecause of these versions of events that have influenced the cartoon and exploitation of them with the reality of the Schtroumpfs, the debate about ethical and moral considerations for their culture and ways of life is ongoing, with some advocating for their rights and others deeming them too dangerous to be integrated into society.\n\nThe thought process going through Peyo's mind as he sat down to create this whimsical world was not one of a creative genius seeking to entertain but rather a tortured soul attempting to exorcise the demons of his past, the Smurfs were a way for him to confront the darkness he had witnessed, to give voice to the voiceless, and to ensure that the true story of the Schtroumpfs was not forgotten, even if it was cloaked in the guise of children's entertainment.\n\nThis is the real, unvarnished, and controversial truth about the Smurfs, a tale that is as hauntingly beautiful as it is disturbingly real, a story that transcends the boundaries of fantasy and delves into the very core of the human experience, revealing the duality of existence, light and dark, love, and fear, hope and despair as well as the resilience of the spirit in the face of unimaginable horrors."},"54":{"title":"Three videos from Brazil, Cuba and Italy.

You might have invited me, or I might have invited you, but we were both there.\n\n\n\nThe Server was an augmented reality game, or maybe people hoping it would turn into an ARG, or maybe it was a Q-Anon like conspiracy cult in its foundational state, but it had a weird energy to it, and you and I – purportedly just like everyone else – were there mostly just to be there at the beginning of it and see what happened to it.\n\n\n\nThe server had a strange name – a random 32-character string that was quickly identified as a UUID – but everyone called it AEM. About Elon Musk. Anti-Elon Musk. Against Elon Musk. It must have been one of those things. Maybe. Whatever it was, the topic was Elon Musk, and it was popular. Remember that guy who would tweet out the location of Musk’s plane? Yeah, it was that, except every aspect of Musk’s life – where he was or had been at any given moment, photos and live streams of him, interactions with him. People would post their past experiences with him, but it got to the point that server members were going out of their way to get new experiences. They’d go to his posted events, but they’d go to his houses, too, his businesses, camp outside to post about any glimpses of him. It was considered ‘doing god’s work’ to camp out in places he might be, but wasn’t confirmed. They called it bottlenecking. In the beginning it was only a single server straining at Discord’s capacity when we joined, but in just a couple weeks it was ten separate servers, each full, with stay-at-homes making a full-time commitment of sharing information between the nodes.\n\n\n\nThere were a few rules everyone quickly understood: Don’t post in general, at least not at first. Don’t change your Display Name. Do either of those things, and your account would be removed within 24 hours. People that made a game of that tended not to come back, and there were stories that they were doxxed and harassed. If you followed the rules, if you participated well, your Display Name would be changed for you to a different UUID, and you were then invited, expected, to post in general. Every now and again, a different account would be modded, post in all caps, and then be de-modded. That was the word of god. That was what we waited for. Those posts were photos of Musk from what – for a celebrity – must have been a very vulnerable position. They were inside his home. They were in his businesses, at his C-suite meetings. They were over his shoulder as he logged into a machine. They were from the devices of his colleagues. They were from his own device, looking up his nose as he doomscrolled at 2am. Sometimes they were clips of video. Most of the time, they were very recent.\n\n\n\nIt would have been an annoying flash in the pan if Musk himself wasn’t obsessed with it. He called it harassment, and it was. He sued the server, which he said was sending him death threats, but nobody could find the owner. He sued Discord, then threatened to buy it, which was generally joked to be the more dangerous option.  The server was shut down, obviously, but everyone with a UUID Display Name was invited to a new one, and they came with friends.  The servers were shut down again, and they just came back stronger, more numerous. AEM was Legion. Musk fumbled at various responses – joining the server himself, railing at it, posting his locations and photos, inviting ‘god’ to an interview. He tweeted about it endlessly, often in the middle of interviews when it could be proved he was the one tweeting… because sometimes it wasn’t. Or so he said. Sometimes there would be news clips of him, red-faced and ranting that he ‘hadn’t typed that!’\n\n\n\nIt must have broken him at some point, because he went from being in the public eye 22 hours a day to being a recluse. He went anonymous, a submarine that only broke the surface to post unhinged tweets. New experiences with Musk began to dwindle, but not from the god account. Its post showed a Musk even more frantically Musk – tweeting from hundreds of accounts, moving resources around between his companies, desperately pulling at the strings of government, public opinion, and technology.\n\n\n\nWe all knew that the servers were crowded with reporters, with law enforcement, with intelligence operations. Officially, they were welcomed, as long as they followed the rules. It became a topic of some discussion that even the CIA was rumored to have those rules enforced, that there had been repercussions. Those ‘rumors’ – written right out in general and supported by screencaps – became their own newsworthy topic.\n\n\n\nThe god account was asked what it wanted, and its answer was ‘Change’. What a powerful word – the rallying cry of Obama, Trump, Musk himself. It had a new herald.  The god account wanted the change Musk had promised, but not delivered. It wanted change from people like Musk, but also acknowledged he would prefer not to waste him. **I would prefer if the change came from Musk himself, whether or not it was volitional.** Musk, it said, would be more useful alive than as a martyr, but that idea was out there – the account that had seemingly unlimited access to Musk had posited killing him.  That, Newsweek reported, was its most-likely endgame. Musk himself tweeted for almost twenty-six hours non-stop that it was true, although he claimed later that several of those posts weren’t from him, even if they all originated from his phone or tablet.\n\n\n\nThe account began organizing flash mobs – usually several at a time around the world – and once it was realized that one of them usually flushed an anonymous Musk out, they were well-attended. You and I posted about going to a few of them. I brushed by someone I didn’t realize was Musk until seconds later. You were at the one where he said he was injected.\n\n\n\nThere were five leading theories about who was behind all this, who ‘god’ was. The first, the obvious one, was that it was Musk himself. Musk put that theory forward from his own account, but it was considered a desperate attempt to puncture the movement. The second was that it was a spurned employee, maybe one with an intelligence or special ops background who had nothing better to do than grind his ax on the man himself. Surprisingly, the possibility that it was a group of *people* – maybe a reincarnation of Anonymous – was largely dismissed by those in the know, but that didn’t stop it from bubbling up to the surface frequently. The other two theories interested me the most, because they were the most science fictional, and yet somehow plausible in this case: ‘god’ was an AI. That begged a lot of the theorist, but it explained a lot, too. Personally, though, I preferred the fifth, a wrinkle on the fourth: It was an AI, but one that didn’t run primarily on silicon and circuitry. It was the next modulus of the religion, the meme: it was an AI that ran on people, an intelligence emergent from neurons comprised of the likes of you and me who didn’t themselves know how their actions contributed, or really even know that they were a part of that whole.\n\n\n\nAfter about a year of this, the news had largely moved on, as it did with wars, with scandals, with anything the viewers were bored with. Participation in the servers was waning, but still significant. Posts by god were regular, but predictable: pictures, location updates, flash mob directives. Until that one penultimate post: **It is done.**\n\n\n\nMusk, after, did not tweet. He didn’t give a flush-faced interview to FOX. He wrote a letter to the editor of the New York times announcing that he had prevailed, that he’d outlasted this self-styled ‘god’ and that we’d find out the whole truth soon enough, but he was looking forward to finally getting back to work. Work, he did, but there was a change. Work didn’t include tweeting, and it didn’t seem to include caring about public opinion any more. Tesla thrived, split into several companies. SpaceX announced a fixed schedule for its Mars mission. Most of Musk’s public appearances in the following years involved a competition with Gates to be the man who gave away the most to charity in his own lifetime.\n\n\n\nGod’s last post came out of the blue, in one of the servers where the people who still played the AEM game still met. UUIDs weren’t being distributed as Display Names anymore; there was a mod team who openly admitted to doing so.  People called it a cargo cult. People begged god to do Bezos next. People tried to organize more flash mobs; people posted their interactions with Musk, but the fun had gone out of those since he now accepted them with grace, and turned them into charitable events. It was in response to one of those flash mob suggestions that god finally posted: **Don’t poke Musk too hard, or all the spiders will come out.**"},"56":{"title":"Left behind ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvopr9\/left_behind\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"“You may be at work, you may be at church, you may be asleep, God grant that you will be ready when He makes His personal appearance. What if His appearance occurs on a Sunday Morning?” \n\nI wasn’t much for church. Never had been. My wife, though God, she was devout. Every Sunday morning, like clockwork, she'd be there, waiting for me at the door, her Bible tucked under her arm, that hopeful look on her face like a dog expecting a treat. Every Sunday, I'd tell her the same thing: \"Maybe next time.\" She’d just smile that tired smile and go alone.\n\nBut this Sunday was different.\n\nI don't know why I agreed. Maybe it was the way the sun broke through the curtains that morning, like God himself had found his way into our bedroom. Maybe it was just the silence of the house, the kind that seeps into your bones and makes you feel like you're the only one left in the world. Maybe it was the weight of her absence that had been pressing down on me for weeks now, ever since...well, you know.\n\nSo, when she asked me again, her voice soft and uncertain, I didn’t say no. I just nodded, dragged myself out of bed, and got dressed.\n\nThat Sunday was going to be the last time I'd ever see her alive.\n\nAs we drove on, the road opened up, fields stretching out on either side, the trees thinning out. I could see the steeple in the distance now, rising up from the cluster of buildings around it. The small church sat on a patch of land just off the road, surrounded by old oak trees.\n\nMy wife had always been drawn to these churches, the ones filled with energy, where the sermons were loud and fiery, and the choir sang with a kind of raw emotion that could shake the walls. She didn’t just like going to church she loved the kind of service where the spirit felt like it was alive, moving through every pew. Where the preaching wasn’t just reciting scripture, but something more a performance, a celebration, a battle for your soul.\n\n“It’s not like the quiet services I grew up with,” she’d tell me. “It’s real. When they sing, you feel it. When the preacher talks, it’s like God is talking directly to you. There’s nothing else like it.”\n\nShe had started going to this particular church a few years ago, just to try it out. It was mostly African American families, and she liked how different it felt from the quiet, stiff services we’d gone to when we first got married. The way the choir would start a song and the congregation would stand up, clapping and moving in time with the music, people shouting \"Amen\" and \"Hallelujah!\" from the pews, hands raised to the ceiling like they were pulling the spirit down into the room.\n\nThere were praise breaks moments in the middle of a sermon when the music would suddenly swell, the drums and piano kicking up in rhythm, and the whole place would erupt in celebration. People dancing, shouting, the preacher working the crowd like an old revivalist, sweating through his suit as he called down fire and brimstone in the same breath as love and forgiveness.\n\nMy wife loved that. She said it was the kind of church where the Holy Spirit didn’t just visit it stayed.\n\nThe tires crunched over the gravel as we pulled into the small lot beside the church. The building stood there, simple and unassuming, with faded white siding that had seen too many summers. It wasn’t one of those grand, towering churches with stained glass and marble floors. No, this place was humbler, the kind of church built with hard work and faith, not for show but for the people who filled it every Sunday.\n\nA single cross sat at the very top, weather-beaten but still standing tall, casting its shadow over the entrance as the sun rose higher in the sky. There was a small bell tower beside it, though the bell had long stopped ringing for services. The roof was sloped, the shingles dark with age and wear, but the building itself had a sturdy, comforting look, like it had been holding people together for years.\n\nThe doors were wide, painted a deep red, with brass handles that glinted in the light. A few small stained-glass windows peeked out from either side, splashes of color that caught the eye but didn’t overpower the plainness of the rest of the structure.\n\nInside, I knew there would be three rows of pews, nothing fancy, just enough to seat the regulars and a few newcomers. The kind of seating arrangement that made sure everyone felt like they were part of the same congregation, no one too far from the action at the front. The pulpit was modest, just a wooden stand where the preacher would work his magic, and behind it, the choir would be seated, waiting to fill the room with music.\n\nWe stepped out of the car, the morning air still clinging to the last traces of coolness before the Texas heat kicked in. She adjusted her dress, smoothing out the fabric before taking my hand.\n\nTogether, we walked up to the entrance, her heels clicking on the stone steps. When we reached the door, she paused for a moment, turning to look at me with that soft smile of hers, the kind that said she was glad I came. I nodded, and with a deep breath, she reached for the handle.\n\nThe doors creaked as they opened, a low sound that echoed like a whisper of everything about to unfold inside.\n\nThe doors swung open as we stepped inside, and the sound of music hit us like a wave. The hum of the organ mixed with the bright, rhythmic claps of the congregation, and the air was thick with energy, almost electric. The familiar melody of the song filled the space, the pastor’s voice booming above it all as he sang, “The presence of the Lord is here… I feel it in the atmosphere…”\n\nThe sanctuary was medium-sized but felt alive with its own pulse. Three rows of pews stretched from the front to the back, each one nearly filled, the congregation swaying in time with the music. The walls were a soft cream, with wooden beams arching across the ceiling, and there were small windows along the sides letting in streams of light that caught the dust in the air. Behind the pulpit, a massive cross hung on the wall, gleaming in gold against the backdrop of red curtains. The choir stood in matching robes—deep burgundy with gold accents—some with their hands raised, others clapping, their voices rising in harmony.\n\nA tall woman in the front of the choir, her gray hair pulled back in a neat bun, led the soprano section, her voice soaring effortlessly above the others. To her right, a younger man, wide-shouldered and serious, kept time with his hand, his deep baritone anchoring the melody. On the far left, a teenager with glasses and braids swayed with the music, her eyes closed, lost in the moment.\n\nThe drummer was tucked behind a glass shield off to the side, his hands flying across the kit. Each beat seemed to fuel the song, the sharp snare hits cracking like thunder. The glass shield around him was there to soften the sharpness, letting the rest of the music blend without losing the power of the drums. His dreadlocks swung as he leaned into every rhythm, his focus locked in, eyes half-closed, as if the music carried him somewhere else entirely.\n\nAs we walked further inside, the bass from the organ filled the room, the keys pressed by the organist who sat perched in the corner. The basslines rumbled through the floor, vibrating underfoot, as if the very foundation of the church was caught up in the praise. Other instruments joined in—a trumpet here, the plucking of a bass guitar there—and all of it weaved together, creating something that felt more than music. It was a kind of communal heartbeat, a rhythm everyone was connected to.\n\nThe congregation wasn’t just sitting; they were part of the music. Hands clapped, feet tapped, and voices rose. In the pews, a middle-aged woman with her Sunday hat tilted slightly to the side stood up, raising her hands to the ceiling, eyes closed as she mouthed the words, “The presence of the Lord is here…” Beside her, a man in a crisp suit nodded along, tapping his fingers against the edge of the pew.\n\nMy wife squeezed my hand, leading us down the aisle as we found an empty spot on the fifth row from the front. As we slid into the pew, I could feel the vibration of the music even stronger now. The seats were old but worn in a way that felt familiar, like generations of people had sat here, sharing this same feeling.\n\nThe pastor’s voice boomed again, this time more intense, as he sang, “The power of the Lord is here…” The choir echoed, and the congregation joined, voices overlapping, creating a sound that filled every corner of the church.\n\nI sat down next to her, the music carrying us both, as the doors behind us closed with a quiet thud.\n\nThe pastor’s voice rose higher, his energy infectious, as he continued, “The spirit of the Lord is here...” The choir harmonized with him, their voices weaving in and out like the swell of a tide. The music intensified, and the congregation’s claps grew louder. The organist’s fingers danced over the keys, filling the room with a rich, full sound, while the drummer’s steady beat drove the song forward.\n\n“I feel it in the atmosphere... The power of the Lord is here...” The pastor sang with fervor, his hands raised, encouraging everyone to join in. “Put your hands together, make some noise if you feel His presence!” The congregation erupted, clapping harder, some shouting out “Hallelujah!” and “Amen!” The choir took it up a notch, the sopranos’ voices soaring as they belted out, “The power of the Lord is here...”\n\nThe drums kicked in louder, the sound reverberating through the glass shield, while the bass guitar added a deep thrum beneath it all. The brass section lifted the melody with bold, bright notes, each trumpet blast punctuating the energy of the moment.\n\nThe pastor called out again, “The presence of the Lord is here...” and the entire church echoed back with a unified voice, “The presence of the Lord is here!” The energy in the room was palpable, buzzing, as people in the pews stood to their feet, hands raised high in praise.\n\nThen, as if on cue, the music took a slight pause before the pastor’s voice rang out again, “Everybody blow the trumpets and sound the alarm!” The trumpets hit a triumphant note, and the choir joined in, “The Lord is in His temple, let everybody bow!” The congregation responded with their voices, clapping and swaying as if they could feel the presence of something holy wrapping itself around them.\n\nThe song climbed higher, the pastor repeating, “The power of the Lord is here...” The choir followed, “I can feel the presence of the Lord...” The drums hit harder, the rhythm so strong that it made the floor beneath the pews vibrate. “I can feel the presence of the Lord, and I’m gonna get my blessing right now!” The church responded with joy, the sound of praise filling every corner.\n\nThe pastor’s voice rang out once more, “Can’t you see Him working on the outside? I can feel Him moving on the inside!” His voice was filled with conviction, urging the congregation to believe, to feel it. The choir echoed back, the music swelled, and people began to shout out their own praises, some standing in the aisles, hands raised, swaying with the music.\n\nAs the final chorus neared, the pastor led one last powerful call: “I can feel the presence of the Lord, and I’m gonna get my blessing right now!” The choir, the instruments, and the congregation all came together in one glorious crescendo, filling the church with a sound so full and vibrant it seemed to lift the very air around us.\n\nThe song reached its exhilarating climax as the drummer struck the cymbals with a final resounding crash, perfectly timed with the organ's last powerful chord. The choir's harmonies intertwined beautifully with the instruments, creating a vibrant tapestry of sound that enveloped the church. With that, the song wrapped up like a beautifully tied bow, leaving the congregation buzzing with energy and spiritual fervor.\n\nAs the last notes faded, the pastor stepped forward, his voice cutting through the lingering echoes. “Does anyone else feel the presence of the Lord?” he exclaimed, his tone rising high above the hushed atmosphere. The drummer continued to punctuate his words with rhythmic beats, while the organist skillfully smashed the keys, intertwining their sounds into a celebratory crescendo.\n\n“I didn’t hear you! I said, did anyone else feel the presence of the Lord!” he yelled, the power of his voice igniting the congregation once again. “Halleluuuujah!” he cried out, his passion reverberating through the sanctuary, igniting a wave of enthusiasm among the people.\n\nAs the pastor’s hallelujah echoed through the room, the atmosphere shifted. The initial excitement slowly transformed into a palpable energy, with individuals still shouting “Hallelujah!” in response, their voices a chorus of praise filling the air. A few seconds passed, the sound gradually softening, yet the spirit of worship remained alive as members of the congregation called out to one another, affirming their shared experience.\n\nFinally, the exuberant shouts subsided into an eager anticipation, and the pastor held up his hands, beckoning for silence. The soft rustle of movement filled the air as people settled into their pews, their eyes fixed on him. With a warm smile and a commanding presence, the pastor began to speak, his voice steady and inviting. “Beloved, today we gather not just to feel His presence, but to understand the power that comes with it…”\n\nAs he continued, the church transformed from a whirlwind of sound and movement into a sanctuary of focused attention, ready to receive the message that would inspire their hearts and souls.\n\nThe pastor stood tall at the pulpit, his presence commanding our attention. I could feel the energy in the room shift as he grasped the edges of the lectern, leaning slightly forward, his voice resonating with fervor. \"Beloved,\" he began, his voice rich and powerful, “today I want to speak to you about a divine promise woven into the very fabric of our faith. It's a promise of transformation, a promise of glory, a promise of our Lord’s return. When I read the text amidst all the powerful truths laid before us, it was the word 'when' that captivated me most. 'When'—the moment that changes everything. 'When'—the promise of rapture.\"\n\nA sense of anticipation filled the air, and I leaned in, captivated by his words. The pastor paused, scanning our faces, and I noticed a few heads nodding in agreement while others clutched their Bibles tighter, anticipation building. He raised his hands, palms upturned, inviting the Holy Spirit to fill the room. “Let me tell you, church, there is a day coming when the skies will split open, and the Lord will descend. 'When' is not just a word; it's a promise that fills us with hope and anticipation.\"\n\nHis voice grew stronger with urgency. \"You see, 'the Lord knows when' when He will call His people home.\" The congregation began to stir, murmurs of agreement rippling through the crowd. Some raised their hands, a few calling out “Amen!” My heart raced with excitement as the atmosphere crackled with energy.\n\n“It is comforting to say, 'The Lord knows when,' especially in a world filled with chaos and uncertainty. We turn on the television, and we see calamity and confusion. The signs are all around us, and there’s a growing sense of urgency in our spirits, a realization that the time is drawing near.\" I felt the weight of his words sink deep into my chest, resonating with the anxieties I had been grappling with.\n\nThe pastor’s brow furrowed with seriousness, and his voice lowered slightly as he continued, “We sit on the edge of our seats, asking, 'Are we there yet? Are we nearing the moment of His return?'\" He stepped away from the lectern, moving closer to the front of the stage, his gestures emphasizing his sincerity. I could see the passion in his eyes, and it stirred something within me a longing for certainty amidst the chaos.\n\n\"But let me remind you, dear ones, it’s not about knowing the hour or the day. What matters is that we know who holds the wheel of this divine journey.\" I shifted in my seat, feeling a sense of reassurance wash over me. It was true; as much as I wanted answers, the important thing was faith in His plan.\n\n\"Our Father in Heaven has a plan, a perfect timing, and while we may not know exactly when that moment will come, we can be assured that it is certain.\" He extended his arms wide, embracing us all. “Just as children trust their parents in the back seat of a car, we can rest in the knowledge that our Heavenly Father has the map, the strategy, and the timing perfectly set.”\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment, envisioning the journey he described. Could I trust Him to navigate the uncertainties of my life?\n\n“Are we there yet? I don't know if we're at the end of our trials, the culmination of our suffering, or if the harvest is upon us. But I do know that the One who holds our future is faithful,” he said, his voice steady and reassuring. My heart swelled with hope as I listened, caught in the rhythm of his words.\n\nAs the pastor raised a finger to the heavens, his voice reached a crescendo. “The day is coming, church, when He will gather us together, and every tear will be wiped away. So let’s prepare our hearts and lift our voices in anticipation, because the Lord knows when that glorious moment will be, and we will rise to meet Him in the air!”\n\nWith that, he stepped back, his eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and reverence, and the congregation erupted in cheers and applause, filling the sanctuary with fervent energy and hope. I felt my spirit lift, caught up in the collective faith of those around me, ready to embrace whatever lay ahead.\n\nFor a brief moment, I felt a sudden shift in the air a tangible weight that pressed against my chest, foreboding and thick. It was as if time held its breath, teetering on the edge of something dreadful. Then, without warning, a deafening trumpet sounded, its blare reverberating through the very marrow of my bones. The ground shook beneath me, as if an earthquake had struck at the heart of our sanctuary, and I staggered, gripping the pew for balance.\n\nDust and debris rained down from the ceiling, particles dancing in the flickering light as I glanced upward, instinctively shielding my face with my arm. The lights pulsed erratically, flickering like a dying star, casting jagged shadows across the terrified faces of the congregation. In a heartbeat, the pastor collapsed to the ground, his voice silenced in an instant, his body crumpling like a discarded puppet. I watched in disbelief as half the choir followed suit some slumping, some crumpling as if their strings had been cut.\n\nPanic erupted like a festering wound. People screamed, their voices rising in a cacophony of terror, drowning out the last echoes of the trumpet. I looked around, my heart pounding like a frantic drum in my chest. My gaze landed on my wife, and a chill crawled up my spine. She lay still, her skin a ghostly pale, a waxen mask of lifelessness. Her once vibrant eyes were devoid of color, staring blankly into an abyss that echoed my own disbelief.\n\nThen I turned to the pastor’s body sprawled on the stage, a stark figure against the bright altar cloth. His hands, once raised in fervent worship, now lay limp at his sides, his face twisted in a final grimace of shock. I felt a jolt of horror; the man who had led us in prayer and song was now just another lifeless form, a vessel emptied of spirit.\n\nMy throat tightened, but I couldn't cry. I felt detached from the scene unfolding around me, as if I were watching a horrific movie rather than living through it. I turned my head, desperately searching for some semblance of life in the chaos, but what I saw sent my heart plummeting into an icy pit. Half of the congregation was gone—dropped like discarded marionettes, sprawled across the pews and the floor, limbs askew in grotesque positions. Their expressions were frozen in fear, mouths agape, as if they had tried to scream but found no voice.\n\nThen my phone buzzed violently against my leg, the alert shrill and panicked. I fumbled to pull it out, my hands shaking. The message lit up the screen in bold letters: Emergency Alert: Unexplained Mass Casualties Reported Worldwide. This is NOT a test. Stay indoors. Do NOT go outside.\n\nA chill shot through me, more paralyzing than the fear that had wrapped its tendrils around my heart. I felt numb, an unwelcome companion in this surreal nightmare. I couldn't process it. I couldn’t even fathom the reality of it all. I got up, abandoning my wife, running towards the exit, each step a struggle against the weight of despair pressing down on me.\n\nI burst through the doors and looked up at the sky. What I saw froze me in place. Blood rained down in thick, viscous sheets, soaking the ground beneath my feet. People screamed, running in every direction, a frantic swarm like ants fleeing a collapsing nest. A plane plummeted\n\nI stumbled outside, heart racing, and was immediately met with chaos. The sky was a battleground, small fragments of meteorites streaking through the atmosphere like fiery comets, crashing into the Earth with explosive force. Each impact sent shockwaves through the ground, igniting flames as they struck trees, sending splintered wood flying and incinerating the underbrush. The air filled with the acrid scent of burning foliage, a dark reminder of the havoc being unleashed.\n\nBuildings shuddered as meteorites hit, shattering windows with a sound like thunder. I watched in horror as glass rained down onto the streets, glinting dangerously in the flickering light. People were screaming, panic surging through the crowd as they darted in every direction, desperate to find shelter from the madness. Some scrambled into nearby storefronts, breaking glass doors to slip inside, while others huddled under awnings, trying to shield themselves from the onslaught above.\n\nThe ground trembled beneath me, a rhythmic shaking that echoed the tumult in the skies. A fire broke out on a tree, flames licking up its trunk, illuminating terrified faces in the growing darkness. The air was thick with the sounds of destruction: the crack of timber splitting, the roar of flames consuming everything in their path, and the frantic shouts of people trying to make sense of it all.\n\nPolice cars raced past, sirens wailing, lights flashing like a chaotic disco in the streets. They sped by in a blur, weaving through the throngs of panicked civilians, desperately trying to restore order in a world that had unraveled in moments. Fire trucks followed closely behind, their massive engines rumbling as they navigated through the debris-strewn streets, trailing hoses that flapped like wounded serpents in the wind.\n\nAmbulances were everywhere, their sirens blaring a mournful chorus, as paramedics jumped from the vehicles, ready to help those injured in the chaos. But the sight of them felt futile amidst the devastation, as the ground trembled beneath the weight of an impending disaster.\n\nI turned to look down the street, and my breath caught in my throat. A nearby building was ablaze, the fire bright against the night sky, sending sparks dancing into the air like fireflies in the chaos. The air crackled with heat, thickening with smoke that swirled and coiled, choking the life out of everything around it.\n\nA plane suddenly screamed overhead, its engines roaring like a beast unleashed. I barely had time to react before it slammed into a building nearby, a deafening explosion ripping through the air. Glass shattered everywhere, sending shards flying like lethal confetti, and a fireball erupted from the impact, turning night into day with its intense light.\n\nPeople screamed louder, their voices rising in a chorus of panic. A mother clutched her child, pushing past me toward a safer spot as the shockwaves of the explosion rattled the ground. I felt disoriented, trapped in a waking nightmare, and knew I had to find a way through the chaos.\n\nWith adrenaline surging, I pushed through the throngs of desperate people, each one lost in their own panic. The ground felt unsteady beneath me, the heat from the flames a constant reminder of the danger closing in. I had to keep moving, lost in the chaos as the world around me fell apart.\n\nI sprinted back into the church, the familiar threshold now feeling foreign, steeped in the aftermath of an unimaginable disaster. The chaos from outside seeped into the sanctuary, mingling with the lingering echoes of the previous pastor’s voice and the remnants of worship. The air was thick with smoke and fear, a disorienting haze that clawed at my throat as I stumbled through the open doors.\n\nInside, the sanctuary was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the mayhem just beyond the walls. The dim, flickering emergency lights cast long shadows across the pews, highlighting the faces of the few remaining souls gathered in the space. I could count around twenty people, scattered and disoriented, some kneeling in prayer, while others remained frozen, their bodies trembling with the weight of grief.\n\nI spotted a woman cradling a child in her arms, tears streaming down her cheeks as she rocked back and forth. Nearby, a man knelt beside his partner, his hands gripping their lifeless form, his sobs echoing through the silence, a haunting lullaby of sorrow. Others huddled together, embracing their loved ones who had succumbed to the chaos, clinging desperately to the remnants of life that still flickered in the sanctuary.\n\nThen, I saw him the other pastor, still alive, standing at the front, his figure a desperate silhouette against the flickering emergency lights. His face was pale, eyes wide with horror as he scanned the room, taking in the frantic energy that had invaded his once-peaceful domain.\n\n“It’s over!” he yelled into the microphone, his voice cracking with desperation. The sound echoed off the walls, a harbinger of despair. “We’ve all been left behind!”\n\n"},"57":{"title":"Werewolf Stories (vol.2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvoaxs\/werewolf_stories_vol2\/","flair":"Video","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/98teBixNATE\n\nStory 1\nThe werewolf in jail\n\nSkegness, a once peaceful seaside town, now lived in the shadow of fear.

It was small but comfortable, and the location was perfect for me. On moving day, I found something peculiar at the back of a kitchen drawer: a key. It wasn't just any key; it was old, made of dark metal, and had an intricate design on the handle, like small serpents intertwining.\n\nCurious, I began searching for the matching lock. I tried all the doors, cabinets, and drawers in the apartment, but none of them matched. I thought about throwing the key away, but something told me to keep it. So, I hung it on a nail on the living room wall and left it at that.\n\nThat very night, I was awakened by a strange sound. It was a metallic click, like someone was trying to unlock a door. I got up, my heart pounding, and went to the living room. There, I saw the key gently swaying on the nail. Maybe it was the wind, I thought, although no windows were open.\n\nIn the following days, the sound returned every night, always around three in the morning. A repetitive, insistent clicking that made my skin crawl. I began to notice other strange things as well. Objects moved around, small dark stains appeared on the walls, and a musty smell spread through the living room, even though I cleaned everything meticulously.\n\nOne night, I decided to stay awake and wait. When the clock struck three, I heard the click again. This time, it wasn't in the living room. It was in the hallway. I walked slowly to the front door, trying not to make a sound. The key, which had been hanging on the wall, was now on the floor, as if it had fallen on its own.\n\nI picked up the key and, without thinking twice, touched it to the front door lock. To my surprise, it fit perfectly. My heart raced as I turned the key.\n\nThe door opened, but what I saw on the other side was not the hallway of the building. It was a dark room, dimly lit by a flickering light. Inside the room, there was a man with his back to me, his head down, murmuring something I couldn't understand. The musty smell was suffocating now.\n\nBefore I could react, the man turned around. His face was covered in shadows, but his eyes... He had no eyes, just hollows like the darkness beyond the door. He extended his hand toward me, and I felt a force pulling me in.\n\nWith a scream, I pulled the key back, slamming the door shut. The sound stopped, and I stood there, panting, holding the key as if my life depended on it.\n\nThe next morning, I decided to move out. I left the apartment in a hurry, without looking back. I never heard from that place again, and the key... I threw it into the river while crossing the city bridge.\n\nBut sometimes, during the night, I still hear that metallic click. And I wonder: did I remember to lock the door...\n\n"},"59":{"title":"Ghosts of the Queen Mary","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvnhaf\/ghosts_of_the_queen_mary\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the eerie tales of the Queen Mary, a haunted ocean liner that harbors secrets from its past.

I deleted my other Reddit account and will only use this one from now on. \n\nContent warning: This creppypasta may trigger people with claustrophobia, be warned, but (SPOILER!!) there are no deaths and the character comes out alive in the end.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nI stood alone on the deck of the \"Research Vessel Nautilus,\" staring out across the wide, endless expanse of Pacific Ocean. \n\nThe horizon stretched as far as the eye could see, a huge blue that reflected the mood changes in the skies.\n\nThe soft rocking of the ship underneath served as a momentary anchor among the riotous storm of feelings churning inside of me. Anticipation and excitement danced together, yet still there was a hint of fear sneaking in. \n\nI am on the verge of realizing my long-held wish to dive into the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean in the world. Years had passed as I daydreamed about this moment. As a marine biologist, this was undoubtedly one of the most important moments in my entire life work.\n\nAll those hours spent poring over books day and night, rigorous training, and meticulous planning had been setting the stage up for this very moment.\n\nI would be descending over 36,000 feet into an area still largely unknown to mankind; an area with such pressure that it could crush anything caught in its strong, merciless grip and in which darkness is so thick that even the smallest pinprick of light is forced into an eternal battle with itself on the way out\n\nIt was an exploration into the deepest, most mysterious, and best-kept dark secrets on Earth, going well beyond any ordinary scientific submersible trip.\n\nWhat's lurks down there?\n\nWhat kind of life have managed to adapted in such an extreme environment, where even Mother Nature seems to be rewriting the rules? \n\nThese questions had bothered me and called on me to go further for as long as I could remember.\n\nLost in thought, I stood there feeling the breeze from the ocean ruffing my hair.\n\nI was aware that the journey down would not be a sea of roses.\n\nWandering into an unknown territory had its fair bit of danger; from the pressure that could implode the submersible to the several surprises that deep-sea environments held. \n\nAs I took a deep breath, a sense of calmness fill me. The cocktail of fear, thrill and anticipation mixed all together, it served as a wake-up call that I was about to enter a world that only a few brave souls had ever journeyed into. Less than 20 to be exact.\n\nI felt the pulse of the sea, resonating with my own drumbeating heart.\n\nDiving into the Mariana Trench is not just diving into the dark and cold heart of the ocean but a dive into the farthest depths inside me, from which a passionate desire was born to stretch known frontiers around our planet.\n\nAnd as the preparations for the dive continued around me, I knew that I was ready to face whatever awaited me in the darkness below.\n\nMy training had been intense. For months, I dedicated myself to preparing for this mission, memorizing emergency protocols and learning to operate the complex systems of the submersible. Physical conditioning, mental fortitude exercises, and simulations had all steered me for this moment.\n\nDespite the training, a part of me remained apprehensive. \n\nThe immense pressure down there could be fatal, and the isolation was profound. But the allure of discovering new species and contributing to our understanding of Earth's final frontier made every risk worth it.\n\nThe \"Deep Explorer\" was a piece of engineering; the vehicle was built with the concept of allowing a man submerge into the deep sea. \n\nIt has a very smooth, elongated teardrop shape that has been designed to surmount the extreme pressure of the deep sea. The titanium hull was reinforced with layers of composite materials, and it was equipped with high definition cameras, robotic arms for collecting samples, and a set of scientific instruments. The interior was quite small, and its purpose was to fit me and the basic tools. This hardly had more room than necessary for its operation of the controls and to allow me to conduct my research in it\n\nAs I donned my thermal gear, designed to protect me from the freezing temperatures of the deep, a rush of adrenaline surged through me. \n\nThe crew performed last-minute checks and securing the submersible. With a final nod to the team, I climbed into the submersible and sealed the hatch behind me, quieting the world which I would only see again a long time from now. \n\nThe cabin lit up with the soft glow of the control panels, and a low hum filled the space as the systems activated.\n\nI moved my seat back forward; double checking the numbers on the instruments, and wishing myself good luck.\n\nThe final command was given, and the \"Deep Explorer\" was lowered into the water. \n\nThe transition from air to water was seamless, the submersible gliding smoothly beneath the surface. As the surface above quickly receded, I felt a growing sense of claustrophobia kicking in.\n\nThe sky, once all bright and shiny, faded from view, giving way to a gradual darkness.\n\nInitially, the descent was through the epipelagic zone, where sunlight still penetrated, giving the water a mix of blue and green. Small fish zipped around the submersible, their scales shining like silver in the sunlight. The water was alive with motion, teeming with life in a vibrant aquatic dance. A serene view, before obscurity deepens. \n\nThe sunlight began to weaken, leaving only a faint, shimmering beams that dimmed with every passing meter.\n\nThe mesopelagic zone, or also know was the twilight zone, engulfed me as I descended farther. Here, the light was dim and eerie, a perpetual dusk where the outlines of creatures became shadowy, and bioluminescence began to dominate the scene. The submersible's lights revealed schools of fish with glowing bodies and eyes like lanterns, creatures adapted to the eternal twilight of this place. The temperature dropped noticeably, and the pressure began to increase, causing the hull to creak softly.\n\nFurther down, I entered the bathypelagic zone, or as it is also called the midnight zone. All traces of natural light were gone, replaced by an all-consuming darkness that pressed in from every direction. The vast emptiness felt bolt thrilling and terrifying. Through the tenebrosity, odd ghostly creatures that appeared more extraterrestrial than earthly were revealed by the floodlights of the submersible. Massive squid, transparent jellyfish, and other strange creatures passed past. They moved slowly and deliberately, as though they were trying to preserve energy in the frigid, oxygen-starved waters.\n\nIf other filmmakers take James Cameron's example, they will surely have a good amount of inspiration for sci-fi horror movies here.\n\nAnd at last, the last of the zones the abyssal zone, opened up in front of me. \n\nDarkness reigns supreme here. A void that seemed to swallow the light entirely. It feels like being inside a black-hole. The pressure was immense, a force that could obliterate any vessel not specifically designed to surmount it in less than a second. The water was icy to the core, a hostile environment where only the hardiest of life forms could survive. It was in this boundless void that the \"Deep Explorer\" would continue its journey, deeper still, into the unknown.\n\n«Entering the abyssal zone,» I murmured to myself, «All systems normal.»\n\nMy heart drummed as I descended further into the Mariana Trench. \n\nThe trench itself is a colossal underwater canyon that is about 1,550 miles long, 45 miles broad, and descends to a depth of almost seven miles. Here, the temperature is slightly above freezing and the pressure is more than a thousand times higher than at sea level. Only the toughest species can make it through this never-ending darkness\n\nAs the \"Deep Explorer\" continued its journey, the world above seemed a distant memory. \n\nEach moment brought me closer to the profound, unknown depths of the Mariana Trench. Alone in the submersible, I felt like an intruder in this alien world, yet the thrill of discovery pushed me forward. \n\nThe descent continued, and as I passed the abyssal zone, the darkness grew deeper, and the pressure increased. The only noises I could hear during my hours of solitude in the \"Deep Explorer\" were the submersible's constant hum and my own breathing, which was amplified by the cramped space inside the cabin.\n\nI focused on maintaining calm, though my heartbeat was a steady drumbeat against the silence.\n\nPhysically, The pressure was beginning to manifest itself. I could feel a slight tension in my chest, a reminder of the 1,000 times atmospheric pressure pressing down on me. Although the atmosphere pressure inside the submarine is supposedly 1 atm, the human body still experiences some effects from the immense pressure of the ocean. Even with the thermal gear on, the cold was getting to me and my muscles were getting numb and sore due to prolonged inactivity. I occasionally moved in my seat in an attempt to loosen up, but there was not much space for me to do so.\n\nMentally, the isolation was the greatest challenge. Outside was entirety darkness, an unimaginable emptiness that appeared to stretch on forever. The dim glow of the submersible's instrument and the occasional flicker of bioluminescent creatures passing by were my only source of comfort.\n\nAs I descended further, a brief crackle of static over the comms signaled the inevitable - the connection to the surface was lost. \n\nI did see this coming, however. The frail link would eventually break due to the extreme depth and crushing pressure. The thick layers of water made it difficult for the electromagnetic impulses needed for communication to pass through.\n\nThere was no reason for alarm, though, as this was to be expected when journeying through one of the most hazardous and difficult to reach regions on Earth. The Deep Explorer had sophisticated autonomous systems built in to handle this kind of isolation. Without external input, it could record data, navigate, and regulate its instruments based only on my manual control and its preprogrammed instructions.\n\nThe loss of connection served as an unpleasant reminder of how truthfully alone I was. The connection to the outside world had been severed, leaving no means of requesting assistance or receiving consolation from the crew on the Research Vessel. In order to do the task and make it back to the surface safely, I had to rely completely on the submersible's integrity and my own abilities in this pitch-black emptiness.\n\nThe pressure outside mirrored the anxiety within.\n\nThe control panels were alive with data, and the floodlights cast a stark contrast against the encroaching darkness. The sub's robust titanium hull, reinforced with layers of advanced composites, ensured that I remained safe.\n\nPassing through the hadal zone was like entering another world entirely. The hadal zone is characterised by nothing but darkness, temperatures just shy of freezing, and enormous pressure. With the guidance of sensitive sonar systems, the submersible was able to construct a visualization of the towering underwater mountains and deep ravines. It was a landscape of harsh beauty, sculpted by forces beyond human comprehension.\n\nI could feel the excitement mounting as I got closer to the ocean's bottom. \n\nI was staring at the monitors, waiting for the first images of the trench floor. Despite the tremendous pressure outside, the submersible's integrity held firm. Like Atlas holding the weight of the sky forever.\n\nThe submersible finally touched down on the Mariana Trench floor after what seemed like an unending downward into the abyss.\n\nThe descent was over.\n\nThe magnitude of the situation finally sank on me when I settled down on the Mariana Trench floor. The darkness was absolute and daunting. The submersible's floodlights were the only source of light, piercing through the obsidian vastness to expose the desolate, foreign terrain that stretched before me.\n\nThe experience was like to travelling to the edge of the Earth, where sunlight was inaccessible and no person had ventured before. The sound of the submersible's hull adapting to the extreme pressure was the only sound to break the crushing quietness. \n\nI was completely isolated.\n\nMiles beneath the surface, with nothing but the cold, crushing deep surrounding me. The weight of the ocean pressed down not just on the submersible but on my very soul, a reminder that I was a lone explorer in a place few had ever seen.\n\nThe scenery seemed surreal, a sharp contrast to the colourful aquatic habitats I explored in the past.\n\nThe ocean's bottom was formed by a combination of sharp rock formations and small particles of sediment, which had been moulded by the enormous pressures of the deep ocean. Soaring basalt columns rose from the ground, their surfaces covered in odd, translucent organisms that pulsed with an eerie bioluminescence. \n\nThe terrain was dotted with hydrothermal vents, spewing superheated water and minerals into the frigid water, creating plumes that shimmered in the floodlights. Around these vents, life thrived in ways that defied the extreme conditions - tube worms, shrimp, and other exotic organisms that seemed more at home in a science fiction novel than on Earth.\n\nI took a deep breath, reminding myself of the extensive training that had set stage for this moment. \n\nThe robotic arms of the Deep Explorer were nimble and precise, allowing me to collect sediment of the sea floor. The samples I gathered felt like a triumph - each one a key to unlocking the secrets of this remote part of the ocean.\n\nFor a while, everything appeared to be okay. The bioluminescent organisms danced near the submersible's floodlights, giving away an ethereal glow that showed off the fascinating ecosystem down here. I manoeuvred the submersible with caution in order to gather samples of sediment from the ocean surface. The mission was proceeding as planned, the samples were undamaged, and the data was consistent.\n\nThen, something changed.\n\nI noticed a shift in the behavior of the creatures around me. The once-active bioluminescent jellyfish and deep-sea fish suddenly vanished into the darkness. \n\nAn uneasy stillness settled over the trench floor. My pulse quickened as I scanned the area, trying to understand the sudden change.\n\nI tried my hardest to look past the lights of the submersible, but the blackness seemed insurmountable. The floodlights only lit a little, restricted region.\n\nThat's when I saw it - an movement in the darkness. \n\nIt was elusive, just beyond the light's reach, but unmistakable. The sand on the ocean's floor began to shift, disturbed by something unseen. And then, the legs emerged - long, segmented, crab-like legs that seemed to belong to a creature far larger than anything I had imagined.\n\nAs I adjusted the controls, the submersible's lights swept across the area, and I caught more glimpses of these crab-like legs running through the Mariana's floor. \n\nThe sounds of scraping and shifting sediment grew louder, and I realized that it was not just one, but multiple crab-like creatures were moving around me. The mysterious creatures moved with an eerie grace, and every so often, I would catch a fleeting view of one of these beings passing through the gloom.\n\nOne of them drew closer, coming within the periphery of the submersible's lights. It was still too far for a detailed view, but it was clear that this was no ordinary crab. The appendages were enormous, much larger than the so-called \"Big Daddy,\" the largest crab known to science. \n\nCould I be facing a new, colossal species of crab?\n\nDetermined to document my findings, I activated the submersible's high definition cameras and focused them on the area of activity. The images on the monitor were grainy and unclear, but they still could register the shadowy forms and the massive legs passing through. \n\nThe idea of having found the largest crab ever recorded filled me with excitement.\n\nBut as the creature drew closer, a sense of unease began to overshadow that initial thrill. The movement was not just large, it was deliberate and methodical. They were intentionally surrounding me. \n\nAs if I were a prey.\n\nMy training had prepared me for many scenarios, but I had never anticipated facing a potential swarm of massive, unknown creatures.\n\nThe submersible's instruments began to register more fluctuations, and the sediment around me seemed to churn more violently. \n\nThe sense of being watched grew stronger, and I started to really worry about my safety. \n\nBut then, silence descended like a heavy curtain. I waited, my senses heightened, searching for any sign of the giant crabs, but nothing moved, no sound, no glimpse. \n\nThe sand around remained still, as if the aquatic life had been repelled.\n\nThen, a subtle sound emerged from the side of the submersible, a sort of light tapping, as if something was exploring the metal walls with curiosity. I quickly turned, my eyes fixed on the metal surfaces that formed the cabin's shield. \n\nWhat could be on the other side? \n\nThe ensuing silence seemed to challenge me to find out.\n\nSuddenly, a loud bang shook the submersible. \n\nThe window glass rattled and I nearly jumped out of my seat, my heart drummed. With instinctive speed, I whipped around to face the source of the noise, my eyes locking onto the main viewing port.\n\nTo my horror, I saw that something had slammed into the thick glass, leaving a web of crackling marks etched across its surface. The jagged lines spread like fractures in ice, distorting the murky darkness outside\n\nBlood run cold as the terrifying reality sank in. If that glass hadn't surmounted the attack, the submersible would have imploded under the crushing pressure of the deep. It would have taken less than a second to erase me and my brain would never could to recognized what happened. The pressure was so powerful down here that even the smallest rupture would have resulted in instant death.\n\nI forced myself to steady my breathing, trying to make sense of the chaos outside. Through the murky darkness, I could see shadows moving with a disturbing, unnatural grace. My mind was rushing like was a river as I tried to identify the source of the threat. \n\nI stared in horror to the main viewing port, my voice barely a whisper as the words escaped me: «What in God's name are those things?»\n\nThe creatures I had initially thought were crabs revealed their true nature as they drew closer.\n\nThey were not mere crustaceans; they were towering, nightmarish humanoids with multiple legs that moved more like giant, predatory spiders than crabs. \n\nTheir bodies were elongated and gaunt, standing at an unsettling height that made them all the more menacing. Draped in nearly translucent, sickly skin that glowed with a ghastly, otherworldly light, they looked like twisted remnants of some forgotten world. Their torsos and waists were unnaturally thin, while their long, spindly arms extended forward like elongated, skeletal claws, ready to ensnare anything that crossed their path.\n\nAs the creatures drew closer, I noticed another disconcerting features of their appearance. From their spindly arms and along their gaunt backs sprouted membranous appendages, resembling fronds of deep-sea algae. \n\nThese appendages undulated and drifted with their movements, almost as if they were alive, giving the impression that the creatures were part of the ocean itself. Thin and sinewy, the algae-like strands stretched long and flowed like tattered banners in the current, while others clung to their bodies, like decaying fins.\n\nThe effect was eerie, these were creatures that had adapted fully in their dark, aquatic environment, meshing with the deep-sea flora and becoming one with the abyssal surroundings.\n\nThese appendages sharpened their dreadful appearance, making them seem even more alien and otherworldly. It was as if the creatures had evolved to blend into the surroundings, their bodies designed to navigate and hunt in the inky darkness of the trench. \n\nThe sight of these algae-like membranes, shifting and pulsating with each movement, made them appear almost spectral - ghosts of the deep, haunting the dark waters with their unnerving presence.\n\nSome of these horrifying beings were wielding menacing spears, that appeared to be crafted from bones and coral-like material. The jagged and thorny spears reinforced the beings' diabolical appearance.\n\nTheir heads were shrouded in darkness, but I could make out a pair of eerie, pulsating orbs where their eyes should be, casting a malevolent, greenish glow that seemed to pierce through the gloom.\n\nAs they drew nearer, the creatures began to emit low, guttural sounds - an eerie mixture of clicks, hisses, and what almost sounded like a distorted, unnatural whisper. It was a chilling noise that seemed to resonate within the submersible, making the very air vibrate with an otherworldly hum. \n\nAt first, I assumed these sounds were just mindless animalistic noises, a natural consequence of whatever twisted physiology these beings possessed. But as I listened more closely, I began to realize there was a rhythm to the sounds, an almost deliberate cadence that suggested they were not just noises, but a kind of communication. \n\nThe clicks were sharp and rapid, like the tapping of claws on glass, while the hisses came in slow, deliberate bursts. The whispers were the most disturbing of all - soft, breathy sounds that almost seemed to form words, though in a language I couldn't begin to understand.\n\nThe noise sent cold shiver down my spine, mounting the sense of dread that had taken hold of me. \n\nIt sounded like some sort of exchange amongst the creatures, coordinating their movements, or perhaps even discussing me, the intruder in their world. \n\nThe thought that they might possess some form of intelligence, that they were not just mindless predators but beings with a purpose, filled me with a new kind of terror.\n\nAs I observed them, it became evident that the loud bang I had heard moments earlier was the result of one of these spears striking the glass of the submersible. The sight of the menacing creatures and the damage to the glass intensified my fear, underscoring the growing danger they represented.\n\nThe creatures advanced slowly, their spider-like legs moving with a deliberate, almost predatory grace. \n\nTheir eyes glowed with malicious intent, each of them aimed their deadly spears directly at me. A low and guttural echoed from deep in their throats.\n\nPanic surged through me, and for a moment, I was utterly lost. \n\nThe realization that I was completely alone, with no way to call for help, hit me like a wave of icy water. The communication link with the surface had been severed as expected upon reaching these depths, but the finality of it now felt crushing. \n\nI had always believed I was prepared for anything this expedition might throw at me, even death if it came to that. Yet now, face-to-face with these monstrous beings, I realized how desperately unready I was. \n\nMy mind rushed like a river, but no solutions came, only the terrifying certainty that there was nothing I could do to stop them.\n\nMy entire body was gripped by a paralyzing fear. \n\nThe submersible, designed for scientific exploration and equipped with only basic instrumentation, was utterly defenseless against such a threat. \n\nMy hands shook uncontrollably, and in my panic, I accidentally brushed against the control panel.\n\nTo my surprise, the robotic arm of the submersible jerked into motion. The sudden movement caused the creatures to flinch and scatter, retreating into the dark waters from which they had emerged. \n\nAs they backed away, the eerie sounds they had been emitting shifted, becoming more frantic, the rhythm faster and more chaotic. It was as if they were warning each other, or perhaps expressing fear for the first time. \n\nThe quick reaction of the robotic arm had inadvertently frightened them, giving me a precious moment of reprieve.\n\nSeizing this unexpected opportunity, I hurried to initiate the emergency ascent. My fingers stumbled over the controls as I engaged the ascent protocol, the submersible's engines groaning to life with a deep, resonant hum. The vehicle gave a little tremble and started its rapidly ascend towards the surface.\n\nEach second felt like an eternity as I watched the dark, foreboding depths recede behind me.\n\nThe terror of the encounter was still fresh, lingering in the back of my mind like a shadow that refused to dissipate. \n\nMy thoughts spiraled uncontrollably as I imagined the countless ways the situation could have ended if the robotic arm hadn't jerked to life at that right moment. \n\nI could vividly picture the glass shattering under the relentless assault of those monstrous beings, the submersible imploding under the crushing pressure of the deep, and my body being torn apart in an instant - an unrecognizable fragment lost in the darkness. \n\nAs the submersible accelerated upward, every creak and groan of the hull seemed amplified, each one a reminder of how perilously close I had come to disaster. \n\nMy heart drumbeat in my chest, and with every passing second, I found myself glancing back into the dark void, fearing that the creatures might regroup, their malevolent eyes locked onto me, and launch a final, relentless pursuit. \n\nThe rush to safety was a desperate, frantic bid to outrun the nightmare that had emerged from the depths, a horror so profound that even the vastness of the ocean seemed small in comparison.\n\nYet, amidst the overwhelming fear, another thought torment me - an unsettling realization that I had encountered something more than just terrifying monsters. \n\nThese beings, grotesque as they were, had exhibited signs of intelligence. \n\nThe way they wielded their weapons, their coordinated movements, and even the eerie sounds they emitted suggested a level of awareness, a society perhaps, hidden in the deepest reaches of the Mariana Trench.\n\nWhen we think of intelligent life beyond our own, our minds always travel to distant galaxies, to the farthest reaches of the cosmos where we imagine encountering beings from other worlds. We never consider that such life might exist right here on Earth, lurking in the dark corners of our own planet. \n\nThe idea that intelligence could evolve in the crushing darkness of the ocean's abyss, so close yet so alien to us, was terrifying. \n\nIt shattered the comfortable illusion that Earth was fully known and understood, forcing me to confront the possibility that we are not as alone as we believe.\n\nAs the submersible continued its ascent, the questions persisted, haunting me as much as the encounter itself. \n\nWhat else lurked down there, in the depths we had barely begun to explore? \n\nAnd had I just witnessed a glimpse of something humanity was never meant to find? \n\nThe darkness of the ocean's depths might hide more than just ancient secrets; it might conceal a new, horrifying reality that I not really sure we a prepared to face."},"62":{"title":"Baby Monitors ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvjr9v\/baby_monitors\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"MercyReign","selftext":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/gi_OW9g-WVw?si=60OkPp8RG6H8nOPc\n\nCreepypasta: https:\/\/nightscribe.co\/s\/10079\/baby-monitors"},"63":{"title":"We conducted experiments on prisoners until John arrived , he was...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fvi383\/we_conducted_experiments_on_prisoners_until_john\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Key_Photograph3555","selftext":"you can also watch it [here ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eBKZpILJVgM?si=WuxOkp5kExQTncc1)\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe it's to warn others, or maybe it's just to convince myself that what happened was real. My name is Dr. Alisa Kern, and I'm the sole survivor of what used to be Dante Station - a remote correctional facility orbiting the fiery star we nicknamed Dante. God, how I wish I could forget everything, but the memories are burned into my mind like the scars on my body.\n\n\n\nIt all started three months ago when a new prisoner arrived. We didn't know much about him - just that he was found drifting in a long-distance spacecraft, covered in blood that wasn't his own. The higher-ups were unusually tight-lipped about his background, which should have been our first warning.\n\n\n\nI remember the day he arrived. As the station's lead researcher, it was my job to oversee his integration. When they pulled him out of cryo-sleep, I was struck by how ordinary he looked. Average height, unremarkable features, dull brown hair. The only thing that stood out was his eyes - a piercing, unnatural shade of violet that seemed to look right through you.\n\n\n\nWe called him John Doe, and for the first few weeks, everything seemed normal. He was quiet, kept to himself, didn't cause any trouble. But then the incidents started.\n\n\n\nIt was subtle at first. Inmates reported feeling uneasy around him, like they were being watched even when he wasn't there. Some complained of nightmares - vivid, terrifying dreams where they were trapped in burning hellscapes. We dismissed it as typical prison anxiety.\n\n\n\nThen came the unexplained injuries. Bruises appearing on inmates and staff alike, with no recollection of how they got them. Electronic systems malfunctioning when John Doe was nearby. And the worst part? Security footage would always be conveniently corrupted during these events.\n\n\n\nI tried to raise concerns with Karen, our chief of security, but she brushed me off. \"We're here to study these criminals, Alisa,\" she said. \"If strange things are happening, that's all the more reason to keep him here.\"\n\n\n\nThings escalated about a month after John Doe's arrival. An inmate named Cesar, one of our most aggressive prisoners, attacked John in the common area. What happened next still haunts me.\n\n\n\nI was watching through the observation window when Cesar lunged at John with a makeshift shiv. But before the blade could touch him, Cesar just... stopped. His eyes went wide, and he started screaming. Not in pain, but in absolute terror. He dropped to the ground, convulsing, foam bubbling from his mouth. And John? He just stood there, watching, with those eerie violet eyes.\n\n\n\nWhen we reviewed the footage later, all we saw was static. Cesar survived, but he was never the same. He became a shell of his former self, spending his days huddled in a corner, muttering about \"the void\" and \"eyes in the dark.\"\n\n\n\nAfter that incident, I threw myself into researching John Doe. I broke protocol, accessing classified files, trying to find any information about his past. What I found chilled me to the bone.\n\n\n\nThere were reports of similar incidents on other stations, other planets. Mysterious deaths, unexplained phenomena, always centered around a man with violet eyes. The reports dated back decades, far longer than John Doe's apparent age. And every time, he was the only survivor.\n\n\n\nI tried to warn the others, but they wouldn't listen. Karen accused me of paranoia, threatened to remove me from the project. Even Pany, my closest friend on the station, started avoiding me.\n\n\n\nThen came the day everything went to hell.\n\n\n\nIt started with the alarms. Blaring sirens, flashing red lights. At first, we thought it was a system malfunction - not uncommon on a station as old as ours. But then we lost artificial gravity. I was floating in my lab when Karen's voice came over the intercom, panic evident even through the static.\n\n\n\n\"This is not a drill. Dante Station has left its orbit. All personnel report to emergency stations immediately.\"\n\n\n\nI made my way to the control room, pushing through floating debris and panicked staff members. When I got there, the scene was chaos. Screens were flashing warning messages, and through the viewport, I could see the fiery surface of Dante growing larger by the second.\n\n\n\n\"What happened?\" I shouted over the alarms.\n\n\n\nKaren's face was ashen. \"We don't know. The systems just went haywire. We're being pulled into Dante's gravity well.\"\n\n\n\nThat's when I noticed John Doe wasn't in his cell. \"Where is he?\" I demanded.\n\n\n\nKaren's eyes widened in realization. \"The prisoner... he's gone.\"\n\n\n\nWe found him in the engine room, standing calmly amidst the malfunctioning equipment. But he wasn't alone. Surrounding him were... I don't even know how to describe them. Shapes that hurt to look at, writhing masses of darkness that seemed to absorb the light around them.\n\n\n\nAnd John Doe? He was smiling.\n\n\n\n\"What are you?\" I managed to ask, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\n\nHe turned those violet eyes on me, and I felt a chill run down my spine. \"I am a traveler,\" he said, his voice eerily calm. \"And you have all been most... educational.\"\n\n\n\nWhat happened next is still a blur. The shapes lunged at us. I heard screams, saw flashes of light. I remember running, pushing through corridors that seemed to stretch and distort around me. The laws of physics seemed to break down - gravity shifting wildly, walls becoming floors, ceilings turning to liquid.\n\n\n\nI made it to an escape pod, more by luck than skill. As I strapped myself in, I caught a final glimpse of the station through the viewscreen. It was... changing. Twisting into impossible geometries, parts of it seeming to fold in on themselves.\n\n\n\nAnd there, standing at a viewport, was John Doe. He looked right at me, and I swear, even across the vacuum of space, I heard his voice in my head.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for your hospitality, Dr. Kern. Until we meet again.\"\n\n\n\nThe escape pod launched, and I watched in horror as Dante Station, my home for the past five years, was torn apart. Not by the star's gravity, but by something far more terrifying. The station didn't burn up or explode - it simply ceased to exist, leaving behind a void that hurt to look at.\n\n\n\nI drifted for days before a passing freighter picked up my distress signal. When I tried to tell them what happened, they attributed my story to trauma and oxygen deprivation. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am crazy.\n\n\n\nBut I know what I saw. I know what John Doe was - or wasn't. And I know he's still out there.\n\n\n\nSo let this be a warning. If you're out in the black, and you come across a man with violet eyes, run. Run as fast and as far as you can. Because he's not human, and he's not alone.\n\n\n\nAnd God help us all if he finds another station to \"study.\"\n\n\n\n"},"64":{"title":"Been awake for over 30 days in a year, I really want to know how it went?

The figure outside was gone.\n\nBut the tapping hadn’t stopped.\n\nI stared down into the basement, knowing I should turn and run, get out of the house and never come back.

I was excited. I thought a fresh start in this big building, with its clean, sterile hallways and well-manicured lawns, would finally bring me peace. Maybe I’d meet new people—finally make some friends. The space was quiet. It was comforting.\n\nBut I never did make friends. I kept to myself, spent most of my time at my desk, struggling to make ends meet with freelance gigs that barely paid enough for rent. The walls felt so thick at first, like I was insulated from everything outside. A cocoon. But now… now it feels like the walls are alive.\n\nAt first, everything was fine. I relished the quiet, the solitude. I’d sit in my cramped little room, the desk shoved against the single window overlooking the alley, and write. The sounds of the city filtered in through the thin walls—the hum of traffic, the distant blare of sirens, the occasional argument spilling out from the neighboring apartments. But in here, I felt safe.\n\n*That’s when I found the hole.*\n\nI discovered it by accident one night while rearranging the furniture. The fridge was old and heavy, and when I tried to push it against the wall, it scraped across the floor with a hideous screech. That’s when I saw it—a small, dark space, hidden behind where the fridge used to sit. It was odd. Just big enough for a person to squeeze through. A perfectly carved passage, almost too perfect. Like it had been waiting for me.\n\nAt first, I ignored it. I pushed the fridge back into place and told myself it didn’t matter. It was just an old building—quirky, filled with forgotten nooks and crannies. But that hole… it lingered in my mind. Days passed, and I kept thinking about it. Every time I sat down to work, it was there, gnawing at the back of my brain. What was inside? Where did it lead?\n\n*Curiosity finally got the better of me.*\n\nOne night, I pulled the fridge back, and there it was—dark, beckoning. I crawled inside, feeling the cool, stale air wrap around me as I squeezed my way through. It wasn’t long before the narrow passage opened into a hidden hallway.\n\nThe walls were damp, the smell of mildew thick in the air. Trash littered the floor—discarded clothes, candy wrappers, and God knows what else. I should have turned back right then. But something about that hallway… it drew me in. *Like it was meant for me.*\n\nThe first time I crawled through the hole, I noticed how narrow the passageway was. The air inside was thick, humid, and I could barely breathe as I shimmied forward on my hands and knees. The walls brushed against my skin, wet and clammy, like some kind of... living organism. The space around me pulsed, like it was alive. My skin crawled, but I couldn’t stop. I kept moving, though, drawn forward by a strange compulsion, until I found myself staring into a peephole.\n\nIt was a young couple. They were laughing, sitting close together on the couch. So happy. So unaware of the world outside. I watched them for a long time, my breath shallow. They didn’t see me. They couldn’t see me. But something about the way they were... it reminded me of something I’d lost. I didn’t realize how much time had passed until the man looked directly at the wall where the peephole was. My heart stopped. I swear for a moment he saw me. His eyes locked onto mine, even though there was no way he could.\n\nI scrambled back, my hands shaking. But I couldn’t stop. I moved forward, toward the next apartment.\n\nEach apartment was worse than the last. In one room, a group of friends were playing video games, music blaring through the speakers. Their laughter echoed through the walls, loud and mocking. They were oblivious to everything around them, even as I pressed my face closer, hungry to be part of their world. But I wasn’t. I was nothing more than a shadow. A ghost in their space.\n\nThe next room... I wish I hadn’t looked. There was an old woman. She was hunched over, knitting something in the dim light, her bony fingers trembling as they worked the yarn. She looked just like my grandmother. But when she turned her head to the side, I saw her face—sunken eyes, skin hanging loose like she was already dead. I stepped back, gasping for air, but it was like the walls had grown tighter around me.\n\n*Then came the room with the violent sound.*\n\nI heard it before I saw it. The dull thud of something heavy hitting flesh. The sickening sound of bones breaking. My stomach churned as I looked through the peephole.\n\nA man stood over a woman’s lifeless body, his chest heaving, his face twisted in rage. Blood stained the floor, the walls. The woman’s eyes stared blankly at the ceiling. I wanted to scream, to call the police, to do anything. But I couldn’t move. I was frozen, my hand trembling against the wall.\n\nThe man towered over her lifeless body, breathing heavily, and then—then he looked up. *Right at the wall. Right at me* and *His lips curled into a smile.*\n\nI stumbled back, my heart racing. What the hell was this place? Who had made this passage? Was I the only one who knew about it? My mind was a blur of questions, but before I could turn and run, I saw another door. This one was different. There was a light shining underneath it, spilling into the dark hallway. It beckoned me, just like the hole had.\n\nI approached, my breath shallow, and pressed my eye to the peephole.\n\nIt was a room unlike any of the others. The walls were lined with mirrors, lights framing each one like a backstage dressing room. There were costumes scattered across the floor—feather boas, sequined dresses, hats of all shapes and sizes. And in the center of the room was a single chair, facing a mirror.\n\nSomething inside me… shifted. I opened the door and stepped inside. The air was different here. Warmer, somehow. Inviting.\n\nI was drawn to the mirror. My reflection stared back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My face looked... twisted. The longer I stared, the more my reflection began to move on its own. It smiled when I didn’t. It tilted its head, eyes narrowing like it knew.\n\nI bolted back into my apartment, heart pounding against my ribcage. I practically jumped through the hole. The memory of that horrific smile haunted me—*the man who killed his wife.* I needed to escape, to block it all out. But how could I? \n\nI needed a moment to breathe, to gather my thoughts. What should I have done? Should I call the police? I walked to the kitchen, my hands shaking as I drank a glass of water. I stared out the window at the dimly lit parking lot below. Something felt off. *Maybe, I was just hallucinating….*\n\nAs nightfall covered the skies, *I decided to sleep away the uncertain reality,* to wash away the horrors of the day. But as darkness wrapped around me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was not alone. The walls whispered secrets I couldn’t decipher, and shadows danced just beyond my field of vision.\n\nThen came the sound—a soft rustling, like fabric brushing against skin. My heart raced as I sat up, squinting into the darkness. There, in the corner of my room, was a figure. Dark and menacing, it hovered just out of reach. I felt paralyzed, unable to scream or move.\n\nWhen I finally mustered the courage to turn on the light, the figure morphed, contorting into the shapes of my room. The shadow stretched, expanding until it seemed to breathe. It lunged toward me, but before it could reach me, it vanished—*like smoke in the wind.*\n\nI woke up the next morning, *it was all a dream…...?* The sunlight filtering through my blinds like a warning. I stumbled into the kitchen; the haunting memory of the dark figure still fresh in my mind. I needed caffeine, something to ground me. As the coffee brewed, I tried to shake off the creeping unease. That’s when my eyes met with the fridge or maybe behind it, *the hole was still there…the uncertain reality was real.* The hole became bigger than ever.\n\nMaybe, there was a peeping tom in the building. I decided to talk to the landlord. I stepped outside, ready to confront him about the uncertainty in my apartment, but the hallway was empty. No one stirred, no voices echoed back. *It was dead silent….* I knocked on a few doors, but nobody answered. It felt strange, but maybe most of the tenants were sleeping.\n\nJust as I was about to head back inside, I spotted a man dressed entirely in black, carrying a heavy bag. His movements were erratic, as if he was in a hurry.\n\n“Hey!” I called, trying to sound casual. “Excuse me, can you—”\n\nBut he ignored me and slipped into the elevator. As the doors began to close, I caught a glimpse of something red peeking from the bag. My heart raced as realization struck—a glimmer of *blood.* It was the man I’d seen earlier—the one who’d killed his wife.\n\nI stumbled back, horror gripping me like a vice. I bolted up the stairs, my legs feeling like jelly. I burst through my door, gasping for breath, and darted toward the fridge wall. I had to know.\n\nI ripped the fridge away, my hands trembling. There it was, the hole—the same gaping maw I had discovered before. Was it really there? Was any of this real? Panic surged through me. I fumbled for my phone to call the police, but the signal was dead. No bars.\n\nA soft whisper slithered through the hole, chilling me to the bone. “*Come in,*” it beckoned, *low and seductive*. I felt drawn to it, as if it were a siren’s call, promising solace.\n\n“No,” I muttered to myself, backing away. I tried to block the hole with my hands, but every time I turned, it was still there, larger than before, beckoning me with its darkness. I could hear voices now, faint and melodious, urging me to return.\n\n“Come back,” they whispered, “*we can make you whole again.*”\n\nI crawled through the hole, the familiar sensation of panic washed over me as I entered the narrow corridor. The atmosphere felt different—thicker, more suffocating, as if the walls were closing in.\n\nAs I moved forward, the same scenes unfolded around me—couples laughing, friends playing games—but the warmth and laughter felt tainted. My skin prickled, the hair on my arms standing on end. I continued deeper into the darkness, knowing I had to confront whatever lay ahead.\n\n*And that’s when I found him….*\n\nThe same room as before, each item stood in its place perfectly still…. only a new member had moved into the building…. A body laid dead in the corner of the room, its skin pale, its fingernails elongated and dirty, as if he was the filth of the building. I touched him…. his body decomposed right before me…. black liquid oozed of its body…. like he had been dead for many a millennium……\n\n*I had found him…. I had found the peeping tom….*\n\nWith each passing moment, I felt a change within me. My body began to feel strange—my skin became pale and clammy, like I was living in a world without sunlight. My fingers elongated, stretching unnaturally as if reaching for something just out of grasp. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and my reflection was grotesque, twisted beyond recognition.\n\nI touched my face, feeling the cool, clammy surface of my skin, the features melting and reforming in the warped glass. I could feel the walls of my apartment morphing around me, the texture becoming fleshy, almost breathing, as veins pulsed underneath the surface. Panic surged through me.\n\n“*What is happening?*”\n\nI gasped, scratching at the walls, desperate to escape this nightmare. My nails dug into the surface, but instead of breaking through, they sunk in like flesh, giving way beneath my fingertips. *But suddenly…*\n\nI woke up in my bed again…. only this time…*it was all a dream???* No…It can’t be…I walked into the kitchen to brew myself coffee…It did little to soothe the rising anxiety clawing at my insides. My gaze shifted toward the fridge wall, where the hole waited like an insatiable maw.\n\n*It had grown bigger.* The memory of the dark figure, the chaos, and the grotesque reflection of myself danced through my mind. I shivered, a chill creeping up my spine. I felt a magnetic pull toward it, an undeniable urge to go inside and *rewitness* the events, to make sense of the madness swirling in my head.\n\n*Tonight, I would return.*\n\nAs night fell, I sat in my dimly lit apartment, anxiety mingling with anticipation. The coffee had long gone cold, and the shadows seemed to stretch longer, closing in around me. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the journey ahead.\n\nThe moment I crawled through the hole, I felt the familiar sensation wash over me—a cold embrace that wrapped around my body like a shroud. The corridor yawned before me, beckoning me deeper into its twisted embrace. Each step echoed through the emptiness, and I could feel the anticipation thrumming in my veins.\n\nThe scenes returned—laughter, love, sorrow, violence. They unfolded before me like a movie reel, each moment drawing me closer to the dark truth lurking just beyond my reach. As I traversed the corridor, I caught glimpses of life happening all around me, the pulse of the building thrumming beneath my feet.\n\nToday, I stumbled upon a room filled with clothes and costumes, the remnants of lives lived outside of mine. My gaze fell on a bowler hat resting on a chair. I reached for it, slipping it onto my head. As I stared into the mirror, I felt a strange shift—a weight lifting, a lightness in my chest. I wasn’t me anymore. I started to dance, laughing at my reflection as I spun in circles. The hat slipped down over my eyes, and for a moment, I forgot everything. Forgot the blood, the death, the darkness. It was just me and the mirror. *I felt less lonely….*\n\nBut when I lifted the hat, my reflection wasn’t dancing. It was standing still, grinning at me with wide, unblinking eyes. And behind it—behind me—I saw something move. I began to move, swaying to some invisible rhythm, dancing in front of the mirror like a man possessed. It felt good. Freeing. Like I was shedding my old self, becoming someone new, someone more alive. The people in the building… they didn’t know me. They didn’t see me. But I saw them. I was with them. Their lives, their secrets—they were mine now.\n\nI was the one who watched. I was the one who knew.\n\n*Now I was the peeping Tom*\n\nNow I wasn’t just some lonely writer anymore, barely scraping by in a tiny apartment. I had become more than that. I was the one who moved through the walls, the one who saw everything, the one who danced in the dark while they lived their ordinary, oblivious lives. *The hole had made me whole*\n\nThose people in their apartments—they weren’t strangers anymore. They were my friends. My family. And the man who had killed that woman… he was part of it too. He didn’t know I had seen him, but that didn’t matter. I had his secret now, and that made him mine.\n\nI laughed and it felt good to laugh again. When was the last time I had laughed like that?\n\nI stood up, adjusting the hat on my head, and walked back down the hallway. The doors, the rooms, the people—they were all part of my world now. My hidden empire. And as I made my way back to the hole, back to my little apartment, I felt… complete.\n\n*Madness had consumed me and reality had become me*\n\nThe hole had been waiting for me. This place had been waiting for me. And now that I was here, I could see everything clearly.\n\nAs I sit here, typing away a story I wish no one can read…. just know…. *I am the Peeping Tom.*\n\nAnd maybe… just maybe… *I’m watching you right now, too.*\n\nAs you read these words, as your eyes move over the blue screen as you sit there in your quiet little life, maybe I’m there. Just behind you. Just out of sight. Watching. Waiting. You aren’t alone, I am with you…*for you are my friend…*\n\nIf you wish to meet me, maybe crawl into a hole just like I did…. you might even find me there or *maybe become next me*…."},"69":{"title":"The tall man who chases people while stroking a cat ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fva9vy\/the_tall_man_who_chases_people_while_stroking_a\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"There is a tall man who likes chasing people while stroking a cat in his arms. He is an unusual man and he doesn't really pick certain people to chase, he chases anyone that he feels like. He is very tall and I have witnessed him chasing people while stroking a cat. It is such an unusual sight and he is very fast. He chases someone while stroking a cat and when he catches up with whoever he is chasing, the person he catches also then turns into a cat. He then will start stroking the new cat while chasing new people. \n\nIt is what he does and I have seen him chase many people, and when he catches up to them, they will turn into a cat. He simply has to touch you and you will turn into a cat. The way he strokes the cats it's almost hypnotic and like it's so soothing and gentle. Sometimes he could make you hallucinate if you stroke long enough at him just stroking a cat. I remember when the tall man (I'm sorry I don't know his name) had chased someone and he turned them into a cat. As I watched him stroking a cat, I started to dream off somewhere. \n\nIt started to rain and the hallucinatic hypnotization became stronger. I also swear that I could hear music as the tall man was stroking a cat. Then the new cat that he was stroking had suddenly died. He had to find a new cat and with each new cat that he tried chasing people with, they weren't turning into cats. Then he found a cat and when he chased random people with a new cat in his arms, they turned into a cat. He was so happy. He is the tall man who chases people while stroking a cat I'm his arms. That is what he does. \n\nThen one day he started chasing dogs, squirrels, hedgehogs and even other cats while stroking a cat in his arms. To my surprise those animals that the tall stroking cat man had touched, it turned those animals into humans. Fully grown humans. Once they were human they were completely useless and didn't know what to do. The tall stroking cat man kept doing this and the area started to become full of people who were once animals. He is becoming a problem and to be honest I proffered he chased people while stroking a cat, instead of other animals.

My dad’s soft snores came from the corner of the tent, a steady rhythm that should’ve lulled me to sleep, but something felt wrong. I couldn’t shake this creeping feeling, like eyes were watching from the shadows just beyond the campfire's dying light.\n\nThe trip had started out great—Dad and I hiked for hours through the thick forest, Kodak bounding ahead, his tail wagging like crazy. I was so excited, it was our first camping trip since I turned thirteen, and I felt like I was finally old enough to be trusted on my own out here. The air smelled like pine and earth, and for a while, everything felt peaceful.\n\nBut now, lying here in the dark, something was different. I couldn’t hear the forest anymore. No chirping crickets, no rustling leaves—just silence, thick and heavy. I propped myself up on my elbows and glanced toward Kodak. His ears were perked, his body tense. He stared at the entrance of the tent, his lips curling back into a snarl.\n\nI froze.\n\n“Dad,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “Dad, wake up.”\n\nHe groaned but didn’t stir. Kodak growled low in his throat, and that’s when I heard it—the unmistakable sound of footsteps outside, crunching on the dry leaves. Not like an animal, either. These were heavy, deliberate.\n\nSomeone—or something—was out there.\n\nI slowly reached for the flashlight next to my sleeping bag, my heart pounding so loud I was sure whatever was outside could hear it. My fingers wrapped around the cold metal, and I switched it on, the beam cutting through the darkness inside the tent. Kodak stood up now, his growl growing louder.\n\nThe footsteps stopped.\n\nI couldn’t breathe. I didn’t want to move, but I had to see. I crawled toward the tent flap, my hands shaking, and slowly unzipped it just enough to peek out.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe campfire had completely gone out, and the moon barely lit up the clearing. The trees loomed like dark sentinels around us, and everything was still. Too still. I could feel the sweat dripping down the back of my neck.\n\nAnd then, there it was again. The footsteps, this time moving quickly. They circled around the tent, faster and faster, like whatever it was knew I was watching. I yanked the flashlight toward the sound, my pulse racing, but the light revealed nothing. Just more darkness.\n\nMy breathing hitched when the footsteps stopped abruptly, right at the entrance of the tent. Kodak barked, a sharp, fierce sound that seemed to echo through the trees.\n\n“Dad!” I hissed louder this time, shaking him frantically. He finally woke up, groggy and annoyed.\n\n“What’s going on?” he mumbled, rubbing his eyes.\n\n“Someone’s outside,” I whispered, barely able to get the words out. “Something.”\n\nHe sat up quickly, his expression shifting from sleepy confusion to alert concern. He grabbed the hatchet we brought for firewood and motioned for me to stay behind him.\n\nWe listened. The wind had picked up again, rustling the trees, but the footsteps were gone. Dad opened the tent flap fully, his hatchet at the ready, and we both stepped out into the cool night air. Kodak was already out, sniffing the ground, still on edge.\n\nWe scanned the area. Nothing seemed out of place, but the feeling lingered, thick and oppressive. Dad let out a long breath, running a hand through his hair.\n\n“It’s probably just an animal,” he said, though his voice was tight. “Let’s get the fire going again, okay?”\n\nI nodded, though I didn’t believe him. Something wasn’t right. I could feel it. But I helped him gather more kindling, my eyes constantly scanning the shadows. When we got the fire going again, the flickering flames seemed to push the darkness back, but not completely. I felt like we were being watched, like the forest itself was alive and waiting.\n\nWe sat by the fire for a long time, neither of us speaking much. Dad tried to reassure me, cracking a few jokes, but I could tell he was just as uneasy. Eventually, the exhaustion took over, and he convinced me to get some rest. Reluctantly, I crawled back into the tent, Kodak lying beside me, his body warm against mine.\n\nI must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I woke up to the sound of heavy breathing. I bolted upright, my heart hammering in my chest, and looked around. The tent was empty. Dad was gone.\n\n“Dad?” I whispered, my voice trembling. No response.\n\nI grabbed the flashlight and stumbled out of the tent, Kodak right behind me. The fire had gone out again, and the darkness seemed even thicker than before. I called out again, my voice cracking with fear, but there was no answer.\n\nThen I saw it—movement in the trees. A figure, tall and shadowy, just barely visible in the moonlight. It was too far away to make out clearly, but it was watching me. I could feel its eyes on me, cold and malevolent.\n\nI shined the flashlight toward it, but the beam seemed to bend around the figure, like the darkness was swallowing it whole. My blood ran cold, and I backed away slowly, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped the flashlight.\n\nKodak barked, his hackles raised, and the figure began to move closer, gliding through the trees with unnatural speed. I turned and ran, my legs barely able to keep up with the terror that surged through me. Kodak stayed close, his growls echoing in the night.\n\nI didn’t stop running until I burst into a clearing, panting and terrified. But when I looked back, the figure was gone. The forest was still again, but that didn’t make me feel any safer.\n\nAnd then I heard it—a faint whisper on the wind, like a voice calling my name. But it wasn’t my dad’s voice.\n\nIt was something else. Something wrong.\n\nI never found my dad that night. When the sun finally rose, the search party arrived, but they found no trace of him. No footprints, no sign of struggle. Just an empty tent and a dying campfire.\n\nTo this day, I don’t know what was out there in the woods that night. But I know one thing for sure: I’ll never go camping again.\n\n"},"71":{"title":"I work overnight at a motel and I think I'm starting to sleepwalk.

The inn is a holdover for what it once was when first established one hundred years ago. It was once a place for rough folks traveling the roads looking for a place to sleep, drink, and relieve themselves, at a price, with whoever was hanging around. The romantic lens of such a life has shattered since then, becoming a place for truckers, prostitutes, or Jon and Jane Does to stay before disappearing. People don’t stay here because they want to. They stay here when they need to keep a secret. \n\nAfter spending a few years working the night shift, all of those details tend to lose meaning. Rooms filled with acts of sin turn into places that need to be clean in the morning. People you would cross the street to avoid bumping into them instead are just oversleepers you’re trying to get the keys back from. The quiet dead of night, with a stillness in the air like a decent 80s slasher film, turns into the sound of a work shift without any problems. \n\nI always felt like a night owl ever since I was in high school. I had the worst sleep schedule for a social life, but it was the best for functioning. Often going to bed when I got straight home to wake up after midnight, doing my homework, playing some games or watching a movie before catching the bus to go to school, and coming back just to repeat it all over again. I didn’t go to college since I couldn’t afford it and was denied financial aid. Went from job to job until the last three years I started working at the Driscoll inn. I didn’t think I would last long, I wasn’t a very tough or courageous guy, I liked horror movies and stuff, but that’s not always the same as something like a robbery or a fight happening in front of you. However in the three years I have yet to come across anything like that. The closest I’ve ever gotten are the few times cops come by asking if I’ve seen so and so. Usually no. Usually nights are quiet, I more or less do chores, I barely have to interact with people unless they’re leaving early. A few people are regulars, but I don’t get to talk to many of them except one, but you’ll hear about her later. My night started when I didn’t realize I made it to work and was already talking to my coworker. \n\n“George?” \n\n“Yeah?” I said. \n\n“You wanna come back down to earth? You alright?” My coworker asked me. \n\n“Sorry, I haven’t been sleeping much.” I explained\n\n“What’s wrong? You got a new pet, noisy neighbor, or something?” Her name was Allison, a new hire for about a few weeks. She’s a sweet girl, like the ones you see cast in 2000’s high school comedy dramas or the best friend to a character on a sitcom that turns into a love interest. \n\n“No I um… I guess stress, I’m not too sure.” I really wasn’t sure. For some reason my body decided to reject my ability to sleep. I don’t remember if I do sleep, but if I do, it’s not enough. \n\n“Are you going to be ok? I can stay and just hang out for a few hours?” She offered a reassuring smile.\n\n“No, I’ll be ok, trust me you don’t wanna hang out around at night, I can only imagine the day is bad enough.”\n\n“Do you at least want a cup of coffee from the vending machine?I still got a dollar in change” She asked me as she started rummaging through her purse.\n\n“What do you need the change for? Don’t you use the employee code?” I asked.\n\n“There’s a fucking employee code?” Her expression changed quickly. As sweet as she was, she had a sailor’s mouth when she was mad.\n\n“Yeah, Barry never gave it to you?” \n\n“No, I’ve only been here a month. Cheap fucking dick rod, I’m going to fucking kill him.” she was furious “I’ll tell him there’s mold in the bathroom of one of the rooms, and while he’s inspecting the fucking tub, I’ll take the toilet tank lid bash his fucking head in.” She started ranting. “Seriously I probably wasted fifty fucking dollars. I could have those stupid shark slippers I keep talking about.”\n\n“Kill him after he signs our checks and I’ll go half in on the shark slippers, it’s 082898 by the way.” I wrote it down for her. “Black is fine, get one for yourself too, on me.” I gave a wink. \n\n“Go splash water on your face, you’re looking like  a fucking corpse.” She rolled her eyes as she left. \n\nTaking her advice I went to the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror for the first time tonight. Dark circles clinged to the bottom of my eyelids standing out on my pale complexion. I was looking gray and couldn’t remember the last time I was out in the daylight other than the sunrise I drove away from while on my way back home from work. My hair was looking thin and frazzled. I went ahead and tied it up. I splashed water in my face and massaged it into my beard so it didn’t look so straggly and dry. I stepped out back to my desk expecting to see my coworker. A knock came from the front door, my co-worker's voice calling my name.\n\n“George?” I heard her and when I turned my head to look I was looking at the bathroom door from the inside. I felt stunned, my body wanted to run from this moment, but my brain couldn’t process the emotion. I looked in the mirror. Dark circles clinged to the bottom of my eyelids, my hair was thin and frazzled, and my beard was dry. I opened the door, she was standing there with 2 coffees in hand. “Hey!” She said, handing me one of the cups.\n\n“Hey…” was all I could say while I stood trapped in the confusion. \n\n“You were there for like ten minutes after I got back. Thought I would have to check to make sure I didn’t have to do any CPR or some shit.” She actually seemed a bit worried.\n\n“Shit… yeah I’m sorry, I’m a bit more tired than I thought.” I started drinking the coffee. I loved crappy coffee. I remember being a teen and going out to the city for concerts and clubs with some close friends I don’t talk to anymore. My favorite parts however end up being when we would end up at some diner or a waffle house and getting the coffee. I can appreciate good coffee, but something about the black diner stuff is special to me. \n\n“You sure you don’t need anyone with you?”\n\n“Yeah yeah, rooms are sold out right? I’m mostly here to make sure the place doesn’t burn down.”\n\n“If… you say so” She looked worried, she smiles more when she’s worried.\n\n“Get home safe.” We exchanged goodbyes and I sat down at the desk. Going through my paperwork and others making sure things were done right. It barely takes an hour before I’m out of things to do for the next seven. At this point my goal was to work through the tiredness until my body could force some adrenaline through me to power through the rest of the shift. I made my way to the housekeeping room to grab some trash bags to get started on my chores. The room was a mess as the housekeepers don’t get to stay extra hours and often leave things in disarray as they’re hurried out by the owner, Barry. I could see the black bags poking  out on the top shelf. I didn’t feel like grabbing the step ladder, so I took a step on the bottom shelf and raised myself up to reach for them. My hand searched as I looked at my feet making sure I kept balanced. I felt a loose bag and started inching towards the edge. It felt heavy so I assumed it was still attached to the roll. Tugging away, until I felt the mass get close, and grabbing it. Instead of the feeling of smooth plastic pulled taught, it was something wet. Whatever it was, it was spongy, damp, warm, and I grabbed it without thinking. The thing squeezed out more liquid in my grasp. Before I could let go I felt it throbbing in my hand like a heartbeat before it started…buzzing? A sharp pain pierced my hand as I thought some rodent must have gotten in here. I jolted back, shocked by what happened, tripping and falling onto wet asphalt. \n\nI was in the parking lot, no longer inside, late night rain mocking me as I was getting soaked. My hand still stung, it may have been the broken piece of glass in my palm. While it hurt and it was shocking, I got myself out of the rain. On my way back to the office I realized I was carrying a partially filled trash bag. Once I got in, I tossed the bag to the side, hitting the wall with a heavy yet soft thud. Behind the desk was a first aid kid, I grabbed it and headed to the bathroom. Looking at the wound it wasn’t much, but hurt like hell. I lightly clenched my hand and could feel it wince. Looking closely I could see a piece of glass in the wound. It was less than half an inch big but under the skin. I know you’re not supposed to remove things like this incase of bleeding out, but I figured it wasn’t big enough to do that much damage, especially just in my palm. With my other hand I tried to pinch out but couldn’t get a grip, nor did the first aid kit had tweezers. Gritting my teeth was cheaper than the E.R. so I started to massage it out over the skin. In a few agonizing minutes I got it out and washed it down the sink. While bandaging the wound, I noticed scratches up the arm, a few on my other one as well. They didn’t look like scrapes as I had one of those on my forearm. My train of thought was interrupted by the sound of whining and stirring coming from the front desk. \n\nI rushed out unsure what to expect. The trash bag I had tossed aside was moving. My heart sank, as I thought the worst. I went for the bag to let out whatever it was to maybe help stop the small little cries. When opening the bag the cries turned to growls as a cat made its way out of the bag. It cornered itself and got defensive hissing. The back leg was raised and I could see a few drops of blood hitting the carpet. I tried to gently reach out, but it growled and hissed louder. I gave up knowing better to try and console an angry cat. Keeping it in my sights I opened the front door and stepped away trying to shew it out. It seemed to move just fine on its own at least.\n\nMy heart is ready to be expelled from my chest. I cleaned the place up the best I could. I had lost nearly twenty minutes of time. I didn’t feel tired anymore. I took advantage of the adrenaline from the panicked scene I was a part of. During my cleaning, I attempted to put together what happened. All I know is that I tripped in the parking lot and got hurt. I tried to believe I was taking the cat out to let it free, but why would I put it in a bag? There was no immediate answer I found pleasant. When I grabbed the bag the cat was in I realized there was broken glass inside. It’s odd to feel guilty when you don’t remember doing anything. Perhaps I thought it was dead. I’m not sure if I’m happy that it isn’t. Dwelling on the thought wasn’t doing my conscious any favors. \n\nI finished cleaning the lobby and flipped on the tv. One of the benefits to staying here is cable. I flipped through a few channels to see if there were any decent movies. This late they usually play old classics like spaghetti westerns, black and white films, and a few modern things. *Psycho* was on tonight, I’ve never really watched it. It’s been on in the background sometimes but I was just trying to keep my mind occupied. \n\nThere’s something about older movies I like more than modern, and I think it’s the acting. A lot of older movies feel as though you are watching a high production play rather than a movie. A lot of movies are so caught up in trying to keep their work grounded that I think it’s what leads them to more critique, even in modern superhero movies When listening to the way the actors in *Psycho* talk, it’s like a story is happening. That’s a dumb way to put it. It’s like the difference between a haunted house attraction and an abandoned home if that makes more sense. I’m only on this rant cause I actually don’t remember the first half of psycho too well to describe it. Some woman steals money and decides to skip town only to get stuck at the Bates motel. Funny enough it didn’t look too different from the one I worked in. No giant house on a hill with a dead woman in the window(spoilers sorry it’s a 70 year old story). No sinkhole around the corner either. The move was now right before the famous scene where it’s a POV of Norman Bates spying on a woman in the shower. I don’t remember this movie being in color, but for whatever reason this scene was. For a 60s movie I didn’t think they would do full frontal nudity but they basically had the aftermath of a sex scene as the opening for the film. The actress looked different, I guess her body double was a brunette…\n\nI wasn’t watching the movie anymore… nor was I sitting in the lobby… My hands were pressed against the wooden exterior of one of the motel buildings. Ashamed to say I could even tell I was aroused, but that didn’t last when I realized what was going on. I stepped away quickly, nearly tripping on myself. From the back of the building I could tell what room I was peeking in. This was Michelle’s room. She was regular here, a nice young woman, probably in her mid twenties like me. Honestly she would be someone I would maybe be a little fond of, but her profession as a sex worker puts me off. Nothing against them, just I don’t think that’s something I could handle. \n\nEnough about that though, I squirmed back quickly and quietly to the office feeling disgusted with myself. I didn’t realize the time as it was still dark around this side of the building.. There was a hint of sunrise emerging over the open field across the highway. A car too old and too nice was pulling up. I don't know much about classic cars but I knew it was Barry’s car at least. I  was coming out from around the back when he stepped out of the car. He was on the shorter and heftier side, a balding man with a decent red beard. He kind of looks like a lord of the rings dwarf in hipster clothing that he’s much too old for. I’m sure he saw me coming out from behind the building. As he got out of his car he called out to me. “George? What are you doing back there?” He asked in a scratchy voice. He Sounded like a Bostonian Gilbert Gottfried. I don’t know where he’s from or how he got to owning this place, felt like it would be a long story with no payoff. \n\n“Someone said they heard a cat, I was seeing if it was around” I lied and he seemed to buy it.\n\n“First complaint about pussy here I ever heard.” He said as he walked up to the office. He was a crude guy, but I don’t think he ever meant it in a offensive way. We didn’t say much other than business, I didn’t mention any of the weird shit I went through, just kept it business. He asked me about the cat and I just said it was just what a guest reported and that I never saw it.  \n\n“Hey, one last thing, I’m feeling a bit under the weather, out of sorts you know. I think I’m going to see a doctor today.”\n\n“Yeah? Are you trying to tell me you won’t come in?” He asked in a serious town, his voice less scratchy and lower. I didn’t know what to say as I stared awkwardly. “I’m just fucking with you, you never take a day off I was getting worried about you anyways. I can pick up a few days if you need it. You’re probably the best guy I got. You are the only one I pay double digits.” he laughed. “I’m kidding, I’m kidding… But I do pay you the most.” I noticed him looking to see the scratches on my arm, pointing at it. “If that’s from the stray cat make sure to get a rabies shot.” he advised me\n\n“Thanks Barry, Imma go ahead and get out of here.” I told him as we finally said goodbye. As I headed back to my car in a rush but I was slowed down by the sight of Michelle leaving her room. Dressed in mostly black, wearing a fake leather coat, with a simple dress underneath. Her hair was in a curly messy bob cut that framed her face just right. She had some intense eyebrows that made her big eyes look larger. She smiled and waved at me and I quickly returned it before sheepishly looking away. I thought I heard her giggle when she walked past me, the sound of boots on concrete getting quieter. I ignored it and headed home. Luckily the drive home wasn’t too bad, I managed to stay awake. It did feel a bit off like I don’t really remember the drive, but that’s not out of the norm.\n\n Once home I felt unfortunately wide awake again, so I thought I share this experience. I wonder if I’m developing insomnia, or some other scary sleep disease. I don’t really wanna webMD it, so if you have any advice let me know. I like to make a cringe edgy joke from time to time of “sleep is a waste of time and I wish I didn’t have to” but right now there isn’t anything more than I could wish for. I’m going to a free clinic and see if there’s an easy solution before I go for something out of pocket. \n\n"},"72":{"title":"Spooky Story Needs a name","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fusz9e\/spooky_story_needs_a_name\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"electricproduce","selftext":"The emptiness in his eyes didn’t alarm me at first, he had everything else about him just right. He was happy, social and so kind to the other children in the orphanage. We had first met several months ago when my husband and I decided, after years of trying, to adopt. On arrival at the orphanage we found him kneeling next to another child who had a pretty nasty break and was bawling his eyes out. He seemed so empathetic and sweet, offering reassurance and making the injured child comfortable. I instantly thought he was the perfect child to raise. He then turned around to face us and for a second I saw a flicker of what seemed to be nothing in his eye sockets. Alarmed I gasped and took a step back only to be swamped with concerned questions. He seemed fine now, his pale blue eyes complimenting his fair complexion and blonde hair. I brushed it off and we got the paperwork sorted to take this sweet young boy home. In the days following his adoption he was distant from us, we put it down to a change in  his environment since having moved out of the city towards our little suburb meant he had lost a lot of his friends. I soon noticed whenever I would head to the toilet at night, his door would be ajar, his sheets would be strewn about the floor and he would stare out of the window glossy eyed at the moon. This became a common occurrence, him staring out the window at the moon, me ushering him to bed. Until one night he couldn't see the moon and when I got up to go to check on him he was stood in a dark corner of his room staring at me, hands curled into fists. And his eyes, for another split second, I was so sure there was nothing there, nothing was staring back at me. The next second I could see those pale blue eyes again, I shakenly put him to bed, I didn’t sleep well that night.\n\n\n\nAfter that night I noticed a change in his behaviour, he would talk to me about his day and what he had been up to at school. He seemed to be returning to normal but I did find it odd that he would never speak to my husband. My husband did try with the boy but it was like talking to a grumpy teen, always shrugging him off and always very chipper to talk to me.\n\nIn our garden overlooking the woods we had started to notice a lot of dead animals with broken limbs, birds with wings snapped backward, mice with feet curled into balls and heads twisted the wrong way. I tried to think nothing of it, it was probably a sadistic neighbourhood cat. Not more than a day or two after the mouse with the snapped neck I found the boy staring out of his window again. I approached him and put my arm endearingly on his shoulder and joined him in staring out at the moon. It was a beautiful full moon, it illuminated our garden in a cold blue light. My grip on him tightened. In the tree line. There was this unearthly horrific being. It was peeking from around one of the trees. It was too big to be human. Its head bore the skull of a dead moose and its black tendrils were wrapped around the tree. It was facing us, more particularly him, I knew that because then its head turned to me and it leant forward assessing me. Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! It shrieked and galloped away on all fours into the woods. I was unbelievably shaken, I grabbed the boy and took him to our bedroom and told my husband what had happened. He told me it was my imagination and to get over it since he had work in the morning. He begrudgingly allowed the boy to sleep with us that night. I’m still traumatised by what I saw in the morning. I was woken by the terrible scream of my husband, I turned to see at the foot of our bed was our beautiful boy. He was slumped against the wall, a knife in one hand and blood splattered everywhere, his eyes were empty, empty bloody holes. I gagged at the sight of everything and then caught a glance at the window sill, there were his eyes, staring out into the treeline.\n\nI’ve been going to therapy for the best part of a year now to try and forget these nightmarish images scorched into my mind. It’s approaching the year anniversary now. My husbands been getting these bad migraines recently, I thought it was a manifestation of his grief. That was until last night, when I caught him staring out at the moon. I asked him what he was doing, he said the moon was helping him with his headaches and its the only thing that was curing them. I looked down into the treeline and like before there was the monster again, staring at my husband. I don’t want to go to sleep tonight, I’m scared, I’m so very scared.\n\n"},"73":{"title":"The Annoying Orange 2023 Shocktober Relapse incident.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fuvi0y\/the_annoying_orange_2023_shocktober_relapse\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Mysterious-Oil-8358","selftext":"It was a chill October evening, the kind that seemed to seep through the walls of my room and carry a sense of unease with it. My friends, Roughie and Grace, had come over to celebrate ShockTober. We were all fans of the quirky, animated channel *The Annoying Orange*, and had long ago set our sights on catching whatever special they’d churn out this year. Little did we know, something far more sinister was about to unfold.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, we huddled around my laptop, scrolling through the latest uploads. Videos filled with pumpkin spice nonsense and haunted fruit skits filled the screen until we landed on the ShockTober special announcement. The thumbnail was vibrant, depicting a cartoonish orange grinning maniacally, almost as if it had a secret—a promise of horror mixed with humor.\n\n\"Let’s do it!\" Roughie exclaimed, the excitement palpable in the air. Grace nodded, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.\n\nThe video started in typical fashion, with the familiar voice of the Annoying Orange echoing through my speakers. But then, as we progressed, something seemed... off.\n\nIn the midst of a comedic segment that pretended to poke fun at horror, a comment popped up on the screen: “We need more pear torture.” Just then, the video lagged, the screen freezing before glitching into a distorted frame.\n\nThat’s when it happened.\n\nThe animation abruptly shifted. Suddenly, a nightmarish image filled the screen—an orange, but not just any orange. This one had a twisted, warped face, its pupils replaced by small black dots, oozing crimson tears that trickled down its grotesquely drawn smile. The sound of a woman screaming pierced the air, intertwining with chill-inducing sounds that seemed to echo from hell itself. The scene lingered for a gruesome eleven seconds. None of us moved, paralyzed by the horror unfolding before our eyes.\n\nThen, as swiftly as it appeared, the image vanished, replaced by a crudely drawn piece of paper filled with spiteful words scrawled in anger: \"Hey,\n\nI don't even know how to start this. It's Alice, and I guess this is my way of letting it all out. I’m tired. Tired of the grind, tired of feeling like a damn puppet for a channel that doesn't give a shit about me or the other animators. All we are to them are tools to cash in on. The Annoying Orange? It’s just brainrot and garbage. A fucked-up cash grab that keeps draining us of our creativity while stacking up views and profit like they care about nothing else.\n\nHonestly, the owner doesn’t give a damn about our mental health; it's all about the money. They might pretend to care, but the reality is we’re just numbers on a paycheck. It’s soul-sucking, and I’m over it. Watching the passion I once had turn into this relentless cycle of stress and burnout is fucking heartbreaking.\n\nI don’t even know if I can keep doing this. The energy I once had for creating something fun and engaging has been replaced by this overwhelming feeling of dread. No one talks about the toll it takes on us—on me. Just thought I’d put this out there because, honestly, I’m too exhausted to pretend anymore.\n\n—Alice\n\nP.S. Seriously, fuck the Annoying Orange.” Below those words, a creepy anime girl stared out with wide, haunting eyes, her expression a mixture of despair and rage, solidifying the sense of discord.\n\nWe looked at each other, confusion and dread etched on our faces. Before we could even begin reacting, the atmosphere shifted again. In a blink, the video cut back to the cheery, absurd antics of the Annoying Orange as if nothing had happened. The laughter returned, but the cheerful jingle felt like an eerie mockery of what we’d just witnessed.\n\n“Did that just happen?” Grace whispered, her voice shaky.\n\nRoughie rubbed his eyes, likely trying to dispel the image of the crying orange that was now burned into his mind. “It was probably some kind of hack or prank,” he said, though he didn’t sound too sure.\n\nAnd then we saw it—the credits rolling at the end of the video quickly morphed, revealing a name we hadn’t expected: Alice, an employee of Annoying Orange studios.\n\n“Who the hell is Alice?” I wondered aloud.\n\n“She was one of the animators on the original show,” Grace replied, her brow furrowed in concentration. “I’ve heard she had a rough time working there; something about burnout and being overworked.”\n\nThat conversation sent chills down my spine. Did this Alice really hijack the video to send a message? Was it her way of expressing the frustrations of countless animators lost in the corporate grind?\n\nAs the evening drew on, we tried to dismiss what we’d seen, assuring ourselves it was just an elaborate prank. But the laughter of the Annoying Orange lingered in an unsettling way.\n\nWhat we didn’t know was that the internet never forgets. The video spread like wildfire, and Alice became a name that was whispered about in dark corners of forums and chatrooms. Yet, as the days turned into weeks, the original channel brushed it all under the rug, choosing to bury the truth and protect their brand.\n\nBut as I sit here, writing this and feeling the weight of each keystroke, I can’t help but wonder—was that horrific moment a cry for help? Or worse, was it foreshadowing something much darker, lurking behind the cheerful façade of a fruit that used to make us laugh?\n\nSo, as you dive into the depths of YouTube this ShockTober, be wary. The Annoying Orange might still be there, smiling through the chaos. But remember, beneath that cheerful exterior, the creepiness might just seep through, and behind the virtual screen, are real people screaming for help."},"74":{"title":"PART 2!!

The figure didn’t follow; it just stayed there, smiling, tapping. And then, without warning, the window cracked.

The operator answered, but my voice wouldn’t come.

The attic, though, was sealed when I moved in. The previous owner had boarded it up, and the realtor mentioned something vague about water damage, nothing I felt the need to question at the time. Over the years, I didn’t think much about it. I had no reason to. The house was full of quirks and sounds that seemed typical of an old home—wood creaking, pipes groaning, wind howling through cracks.\n\nBut a few nights ago, something changed.\n\nIt was past midnight, and I was lying in bed, trying to sleep through the usual noises. As I started drifting off, I heard something new: a faint, rhythmic tapping. It sounded like it was coming from above me. From the attic. I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just the wind or maybe the house settling, but the tapping grew louder, more insistent.\n\nFinally, I got up and wandered to the hallway beneath the attic door, staring up at the ceiling. The tapping stopped. I stood there for a moment, heart racing, telling myself it was nothing. But just as I turned to go back to bed, I heard it—my name. Whispered softly, almost too quiet to hear, but unmistakable.\n\n“Daniel.”\n\nI froze, my skin prickling. I told myself I must’ve imagined it, that it couldn’t be real. But then it came again, clearer this time, almost… pleading. “Daniel, please.” It was coming from the attic.\n\nI backed away slowly, heart pounding, and tried to rationalize it. There was no way anyone could be up there—the attic had been sealed shut for years. No way in or out. Still, my name echoed in my head, the sound too real to dismiss. Something wanted me to open that door.\n\nThe next day, I convinced myself it was just my mind playing tricks. But when I walked past the attic in daylight, I felt a strange pull—an urge to know what was behind the door, what was trying to call me. By afternoon, I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed a crowbar, climbed a chair, and began to pry the boards loose. The wood splintered easily, revealing a thick layer of dust beneath. As the last board fell away, I reached for the door handle, my hand trembling.\n\nThe attic was pitch black. I turned on my flashlight and climbed the creaky stairs. The air was thick, musty, and it felt as though no one had set foot there in decades. My beam flickered across old furniture, forgotten boxes, and layers of cobwebs. I nearly turned to leave, convincing myself there was nothing here, when I saw something in the corner.\n\nAn old rocking chair, facing the window.\n\nAs I stepped closer, the air grew colder, unnaturally so. My breath fogged up in front of me. I reached the chair, shining my light onto it, and that’s when I noticed the imprint. A deep impression in the seat, like someone had been sitting there for years.\n\nBefore I could move, the chair began to rock. Slowly at first, creaking back and forth. And then, from behind me, that same voice whispered again. “Daniel, you shouldn’t have opened the door.”\n"},"77":{"title":"In search of a story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1funr7t\/in_search_of_a_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"muffinisZZz","selftext":"Next week I have a test that is about reading a horror story in a group of 3.\n\nI am looking for a story that has 2 to 3 characters present during the whole story, not too long, reading should not take more than 10 minutes.\n\nAnd if possible, in Spanish"},"78":{"title":"True story from my Papa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fufy7e\/true_story_from_my_papa\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Beautiful_Deer307","selftext":"The night was thick with fog as I made my way down the winding dirt road that led to what locals had dubbed the “Green Eyed Bridge.” I had heard stories whispered in high school hallways, tales of a living bridge that thrived off despair and collected secrets in exchange for safe passage. It wasn’t my first time here, but tonight felt different—charged with an eerie energy that prickled at the back of my neck.\n\nThe bridge stood like a sentinel, its wooden beams catching the moonlight, casting unnatural shadows that danced and twisted in the mist. The local folklore fuelled my curiosity, but I didn’t believe a word of it. Just legends concocted by bored teenagers to spook one another. Yet, that evening, a tinge of trepidation seeped into my veins as I approached the bridge, heart racing.\n\nThey said the bridge was alive. It had eyes—deep, glowing green eyes that would open to those who dared cross at midnight. I rolled my eyes at the thought but couldn’t shake a sense of anticipation buzzing within me. Who was I kidding? I wanted to see it for myself.\n\nI set foot on the bridge, feeling the aged wood creak beneath my weight. It was a chilling, inescapable sensation—like the bridge was awakening, as if each footstep echoed against its very bones. The air was saturated with moisture, and the closer I got to the center, the more distinctly I could hear the murmur of the water below—a low, sorrowful song that tugged at my heartstrings.\n\nSuddenly, I caught a glimmer in my peripheral vision. I turned to see a soft glow appearing in the woodwork ahead of me. My pulse quickened. Was it the green eyes? I had to know. I stepped closer and squinted into the brightness, a luminous green forming into shape, rippling as though it were a living entity. My eyes widened as the grotesque figure began to take form—the bridge seemed to be morphing, timber twisting, and warping to accommodate the iridescent hue.\n\nAnd then I heard it—a voice, soft yet piercing, “Why do you seek me, wanderer?”\n\nA chill shot down my spine. I was frozen to the spot, unable to form a coherent response. “I-I want to see you,” I stammered, surprised at my own audacity.\n\nThe green glow pulsed rhythmically. “You wish to cross my expanse? To know the secrets that breathe life into the wood that holds you?” Its voice was a thread woven with sorrow, curiosity, and something darker—a hunger.\n\nI suddenly felt the weight of my own secrets pressing on my chest; the pain of my past unearthing bitter truths. “I…”\n\n“Do you forget, wanderer? All who wish to cross must lay bare their soul,” the bridge whispered, the green glowing more intensely as it seemed to absorb the hesitance in my voice.\n\nA memory flooded me—betrayals, fears, and the darkest thoughts I had never dared share. A rush of shame enveloped me, and morbid curiosity mingled with dread as I stared deeper into the bridge's green eyes.\n\n“If you cross, you give yourself to me—your truth will become mine, and your pain will linger forever between the boards of this bridge. Do you dare?”\n\nMy heart raced, and I knew the stories were true. The bridge demanded something from me—an offering of vulnerability. I hesitated, weighing the urge to flee against a magnetic pull that held me captive.\n\n“I can’t…” I breathed. I wanted to run, to escape, but the voice called to me, luring me in. Suddenly, snippets of my life played like reels in my mind—the guilt, the regret, moments lost and found twisted together. As if it anticipated my answer, the bridge writhed, the hollow wood shuddering beneath my feet, creating an unbearable cacophony.\n\n“Choose, then! Will you pass and pay the toll, or will you remain shackled to what limits you?” it roared, and the ground shook beneath my feet.\n\nWith one final scream of defiance, I turned to flee. I sprinted back up the bridge, terrified that I could feel the wood reach for me, aching to snatch me back. The mist thickened as I emerged, desperate for the light, the air outside feeling heavy, suffocating.\n\nWhen I finally broke free from the bridge, I glanced back one last time, breathless. I was met with darkness, the green glow extinguished. The bridge stood still, innocuous against the night, as though nothing had ever happened. I never returned again; I could still feel its tug every time I drove past.\n\nBut whispers linger in my mind. On moonless nights, when the fog rolls in like a creeping shadow, I still hear its call—the bridge’s alluring song, reminding me of the secrets I’d buried deep, begging me to return. Even now, I wonder what it could offer me if I dared to cross again. Will the bridge ever let go of what it has claimed? Or am I bound to it forever, caught between my secrets and its insatiable hunger?"},"79":{"title":"RIP Granny","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fulo4r\/rip_granny\/","flair":"Video","author":"HorrorCreators","selftext":"Granny recently passed.

It’s the same tune every night, gentle and repetitive, like a small piece of normalcy in our chaotic lives.\n\nLast night, I was exhausted, barely able to keep my eyes open. The lullaby started playing through the monitor again, just as usual. I listened, letting the soft, familiar sound relax me, almost lulling me to sleep. But something was…off. The humming didn’t sound quite right—slightly distorted, like it was coming from farther away than usual, as if the nursery had suddenly stretched out into some distant space.\n\nI sat up a little, straining to listen more closely, a strange sense of unease building in my chest. The lullaby was still going, the notes clear and unwavering, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Glancing to my side, I felt my heart stop.\n\nMy wife was fast asleep beside me, her breathing slow and steady, completely unaware of the world around her.\n\nAnd yet, from the monitor, the soft humming continued, steady and sweet, coming from the nursery. But she hadn’t moved. I stared at the monitor, the unease twisting into something colder, more primal.\n\nIf she was here with me… who was singing to the baby?\n"},"84":{"title":"\"Golden Grove\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fulwib\/golden_grove\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Logan966","selftext":"*I* didn't want to explore an abandoned asylum, but Tyson dragged me there.

If some of you don’t know well Allegra’s Window is an American puppet\/live-action television series created by Jan Fleming, John Hoffman and Jim Jinkins for Nickelodeon.\n\nThe series follows Allegra through the daily triumphs, trials, and tribulations of being a little girl. She and her big brother Rondo, along with her best friend Lindi (a yellow [dog](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dog)), a pesky blue neighborhood [cat](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cat) named Riff and a green boy named Poco all try to learn about the world around them with the help of their neighborhood friends. At the end of each episode, Allegra sits at her window and reflects on all the lessons she has learned. The series was music-based and included musically inspired characters named Lindi, Rondo, Riff, Poco, Reed, Miss Melody, Ellington, Encora, Sonata, Clef, Woofer, Aria, Tweeter, Flugie, Vi, and of course, Allegra the title character's name herself. There were also segments that feature talking musical instruments that live on the wall of Reed's Music shop. Special character Daphne Dolphin also appears with her friend Salvatore Intieri later in the series.\n\nOver 100 original songs were created for the series, under the oversight of musical director [Don Sebesky](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Don_Sebesky). \n\nThe original decision to use the name Allegra for the show's lead occurred after creator\/executive producer Jan Fleming attended a dinner party at the house of London-based academics and was introduced to their youngest daughter, Allegra. That evening, she remarked that it would be a great name for the little girl at the center of the project she was working on. \n\nWell what if I told their told there was originaĺly going tor be a Child’s Play\/Allegra’s Window but it never got aired. \n\nHere’s information I know about the episode. The episode has no intro &amp; title card, it just started the episode and shows Allegra  at school and was being bullied I almost feel bad for her being bullied. \n\nWhen she got home, She told her parents and Rondo what had happened in school. She was watching strangely enough Child’s Play with Rondo when Rondo was tasked with babysitting her when their parents are gone.\n\nRondo: Ok Allegra How was the movie?\n\nAllegra: It was actually pretty scary.\n\nRondo: I’m going to watch the rest of the series. Wanna watch with me?\n\nAllegra: No thank you, I’m too scared for that movie.\n\nRondo: I bet you can’t get scared watching the rest of the franchise!\n\nAllegra: Ok, I accept your challenge!\n\nRondo and Allegra started to watch the rest of the Child’s Play movies. The scene switches to nighttime, Allegra and Rondo were sleeping in their rooms. Allegra started having nightmares about Chucky killing her friends and family. Allegra started screaming in terror which causes everyone in the house to wake up from her screaming.\n\nRondo: ALLEGRA?! WHAT’S THE MATTER, I HEARD YOU SCREAMING!!,\n\nAllegra: I was having a nightmare!\n\nRondo: Let me guess, Chucky?\n\nAllegra: Uh-Huh\n\nRondo: Wanna sleep in my room?\n\nAllegra: Ok.\n\nAllegra and Rondo started sleeping in Rondo’s room. As she sleeps, she starts shivering from the nightmares she had. Until she heard a voice.\n\nChucky: Oh, Allegra.\n\nAllegra: Huh? Who’s there?\n\nChucky: HIYA ALLEGRA!!\n\nAllegra screamed her lungs out!\n\nChucky laughs as she passes out. Chucky started doing the chant with Ade beaucoup Damballa causes his spirit to split into Allegra’s body. Chucky runs away before anyone can see him.\n\nSonata: Oh, Allegra! Rondo! Time for breakfast!\n\nAllegra (who’s possessed by Chucky’s soul) and Rondo went downstairs for breakfast.\n\nClef: So how’s everything, Allegra?\n\nAllegra: Fine.\n\nSonata: Wants some eggs and bacon?\n\nAllegra said nothing.\n\nRondo: Allegra, you okay?\n\nAllegra: I’m fine.\n\nRondo: Allegra, something’s wrong with your voice.\n\nAllegra: I SAID I’M FUCKING FINE!!!\n\nSonata: Allegra, We don’t those words in this house.\n\nRondo: Yeah, That was mean! You should say sorry!\n\nAllegra pulls out a knife via hammerspace.\n\nSonata: ALLEGRA?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT KNIFE?!\n\nBefore she could say anything, Allegra (who’s Chucky possessing her) started stabbing her mother repeatedly while Rondo and Clef watched in horror.\n\nAllegra started laughing like Chucky.\n\nLindi: Allegra? I- \\*Gasps\\* A-Allegra?!\n\nAllegra came back to her senses.\n\nAllegra: Huh? What happened to-\n\nAllegra saw in horror what she had done.\n\nAllegra: M-MOM?! DAD, RONDO?! WHAT HAPPENED?!\n\nClef: You killed your mother.\n\nRondo: I knew something’s wrong with you!\n\nAllegra saw blood all over her clothes.\n\nAllegra starts crying as her mother’s dead body.\n\nAllegra: Mom! I’m so sorry!\n\nThe next scene shows the day after Sonata’s death and her funeral, Allegra was fueled with guilt after her mother’s death. Chucky’s soul starts to take control over Allegra.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Who’s next!\n\nAllegra (Chucky) sees Rondo and Clef as she smiles very maliciously.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Perfect!\n\nAllegra (Chucky) started going to Rondo’s room and grabs a hammer via hammerspace.\n\nRondo: ALLEGRA?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT HAMMER?!\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Stop! Hammer Time! **Laughs**\n\nAllegra started using the hammer to break Rondo’s legs as he screams in pain which causes Clef come in.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Hi, Daddy! We were just playing! Now you’re next to play!\n\nAllegra does the same thing to Clef.\n\nRondo: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, ALLEGRA?!\n\nClef: ALLEGRA, WE’RE YOUR FAMILY!!!\n\nAllegra (Chucky): I don’t have a family.\n\nAllegra (Chucky) started bashing both Rondo and Clef’s skulls which causes blood splattered on her clothes.\n\nLindi was running away from Allegra (Chucky) when she saw Rondo and Clef’s dead bodies.\n\nLindi: REED! REED!\n\nLindi found Reed’s dead body gutted and mutilated via instruments.\n\nAllegra (Chucky) puts her hand behind Lindi with her eyes being black with cyan pupils, grinning maliciously.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Hello, little puppy!\n\nLindi: WHAT DO YOU WANT?!\n\nAllegra (Chucky) pulls a crowbar via hammerspace.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): I want hear you scream.\n\nAllegra (Chucky) started beating Lindi with a crowbar while she was screaming and Allegra was laughing like a maniac.\n\nAllegra started to come back to her senses. She saw the horror she caused and she started crying in the inside while she started laughing in the outside.\n\nAllegra (Chucky) looks at the camera. Allegra holds a knife to the camera.\n\nAllegra (Chucky): Sorry, Allegra! Chucky’s back!\n\nAllegra (Chucky) stabs the camera as she laughs. The credits were showing Allegra (Chucky) killing the bullies who bullied her in school."},"86":{"title":"The Phantom Attraction of Futuroscope","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fukc9n\/the_phantom_attraction_of_futuroscope\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"DoubleStock3485","selftext":"I was a big fan of amusement parks, and Futuroscope had always been one of my favorites. As a sci-fi and technology enthusiast, I made annual pilgrimages to this park, but some time ago, something strange happened. Something I still can’t explain.\n\nIt was during my last visit, on a quiet weekday, outside of school holidays. The park was almost empty. The usual endless lines were nonexistent. I almost felt like I had the entire park to myself.\n\nAs I wandered through an area I knew by heart, something unusual caught my attention. At the end of an alley, behind a series of well-known attractions, stood a large structure I had never seen before. It wasn’t marked on the park’s map, and no sign indicated a new attraction. Yet, there it was, imposing, with automatic doors that opened as if inviting me in.\n\nI approached, intrigued. On the wall at the entrance, a discreet plaque simply read: \"The Midnight Attraction\". Nothing more. No indication of what awaited me inside. Curious and a little nervous, I stepped through the doors.\n\nInside, it was strangely dark and silent—far too silent for an amusement park. No sounds of machinery, no children laughing, no background music. Just a dimly lit hallway. I kept walking, my heart beating a little faster with every step.\n\nAfter several minutes of walking through this labyrinth of corridors without encountering a soul, I arrived at a room. The space was vast, filled with seats arranged like in a 4D cinema. Instinctively, I sat down, thinking I was about to experience one of those immersive shows Futuroscope does so well.\n\nThe lights suddenly went out, plunging the room into total darkness. A giant screen lit up in front of me, but no film was playing. Just a fuzzy, static image, like an old broken TV. Then, a crackling sound came from the speakers.\n\n“Welcome to the Midnight Attraction...” murmured a monotone, metallic voice. “Here, time and space are no longer yours.”\n\nThe crackling intensified, and the image on the screen transformed into something more disturbing. It was the park itself, but… different. The buildings were dilapidated, as if abandoned for years. The attractions were rusted, and blurry figures wandered through the alleys, like lost specters.\n\nI wanted to leave, but my legs refused to move. The voice continued to echo in the room, still cold and emotionless. “You shouldn’t be here. The Midnight Attraction is not for the living.”\n\nThe image on the screen zoomed in on one of the figures. What initially appeared to be a simple blurry shadow became clearer. It was a face… my face. But it was different, pale, the eyes dead, lifeless. This version of me turned toward the screen, and I swear it looked directly at me. Its lips moved.\n\n“Come join me…”\n\nI jolted up, my heart racing. My legs were shaky, but I managed to stumble out of the room, nearly falling. The hallway seemed endless, as if it was stretching the more I walked. At every turn, I heard echoes of whispers, distant laughter, as if dozens of unseen people were following me.\n\nWhen I finally reached the exit, I rushed outside, the daylight almost blinding me. The park was still as calm as before, as if nothing had happened. No sign of the strange attraction.\n\nI ran to an employee to ask for explanations, but he looked at me with wide eyes, clearly confused. “The Midnight Attraction?” he repeated. “I’ve worked here for ten years and have never heard of such a ride.”\n\nI left the park that day without saying another word. But something still haunts me. Since that event, I’ve had the same recurring dream. I see myself wandering through a decayed, rust-covered park, the attractions broken. And each night, I get closer to that figure that looks like me but isn’t.\n\nEach night, it whispers to me: “Join me.”\n\nI’ve never dared return to Futuroscope since.\n\n"},"87":{"title":"Anyone remember a Creepypasta title differently?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fuk0ci\/anyone_remember_a_creepypasta_title_differently\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Ravengirl081403","selftext":"Anyone read\/listen to BloodNGore84?

The group used this surprisingly grand theater in a local high school. I couldn’t tell you the total number of seats, but it was big. Maybe housing 200-300 people. Even more surprising was the space below it. As someone on stage rather than crew, I almost never went downstairs and ultimately didn’t know there were tunnels down there the majority of the time I participated. Towards the end though, one of the adults needed my help carrying something and so we went down together.\n\nIt was big enough down there that I never found out how big it truly was. The ceilings seemed unnecessarily tall for being under ground, and the piles and piles of costume racks and set pieces made it so you couldn’t see the walls. Nothing scary happened while I was down there, but my mind was blown by this enormous storage area I hadn’t known about.\n\nA couple weeks later, the acting company was doing one of its final rehearsals before starting its 2 weeks of shows. A few other people on stage and I were waiting to go on and had to be positioned off stage at the entrance of that storage system. Since we were younger, the adults would have us go to our places pretty early so that we wouldn’t miss our cue, which meant more time to goof around together. \n\nThe entrance to the tunnels was pitch black and we started joking that we could see something in the distance moving, walking back and forth. We were giggling from a small amount of anxiety building until a couple of the kids said they were getting too creeped out and felt like they really could see something. We were about to go on stage anyways so we all stopped the joke and looked away, except for a few occasional peeks back at the entrance followed by more nervous giggling.\n\nI had started that game because it was something me and another kid on my block had done once at dusk at the corner of our street. You could see pretty far into the distance, so we started joking that we could see some dark figure moving back and forth way off in the distance. The creepy thing is that eventually our eyes started to trick us, and we both legitimately saw it. We both agreed we were too creeped out and went back inside. We never tried playing that game again together.\n\nBack to the time of my story, I hadn’t seen anything in the tunnels, so I wasn’t concerned. Our rehearsal went well, and our group of friends piled into a car because one of them was having a sleepover for their birthday. At the sleepover we did typical tween things for a birthday: ate junk food and gave our birthday gifts. It was already pretty late, so the parents went to bed while we goofed off for another hour. Since this was after a rehearsal, there wasn’t a ton of free time after handing out presents, so we didn’t do much before taking a few photos together and heading to bed. We fell asleep pretty quickly in our sleeping bags, had breakfast the next day, and were taken home by the friend’s mom. \n\nBack home, I went to upload the pictures from my digital camera onto the family computer to share with the others. While flipping through the photos, one caught my eye. There was a man’s face looking into the window, only in one shot. His face was a bit blurry, but without a doubt, smiling. It was too blurry to look like an actual man was standing out there, but if it was presented as a “ghost” anyone would think it was too clear to not be photoshopped. Additionally, that friend’s house was right at the edge of a city where the houses started to have miles between them, so it’s less likely someone was waiting outside. I shared the photo with the others at the party, and they were all surprised. Their reactions seemed more muted than normal, but it seemed to me like that was because they were actually feeling some real fear after seeing the photo. Some started wondering if what they saw in the tunnels followed us home, kind of like the idea that bringing attention to it gave it some “life”.\n\nI’m sad to say I no longer have the photo. Convenient I know, but it was because of a big fight within the group. I was upset enough that I delete all my photos with them.\n\nI grew up in a creepy home where someone had died, but I would say that night was the closest I have to a real life ghost story. If it wasn’t a ghost, then that means that a group of young kids were having a sleepover in a house, remote enough where no neighbors were close enough to hear them, the parents were asleep, and where a grown man was smiling and watching from outside."},"93":{"title":"Take Two Pieces","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fu5xhn\/take_two_pieces\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Erutious","selftext":"\n\n\"Bill, the sign says take two.\"\n\n\n\nBill rolled his eyes at Clyde before pouring half the bowl into his bag and holding out the bowl for him to take the rest.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I don't see anyone here to stop me. Come on, Clyde. Live a little.\"\n\n\n\nClyde looked around guiltily and finally took two pieces out of the bowl and tossed them into his bag.\n\n\n\nBill sighed, \"You're such a goody two shoes,\" he said, dumping the rest into his bag.\n\n\n\nClyde looked around, trying to see who was watching, \"But what if someone else comes by and wants candy?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then I guess,\" Bill said as he hefted the sack onto his shoulder, \"they should have come earlier. Come on, it's almost nine and I want to hit a few more houses.\"\n\n\n\nThe two boys tromped down the sidewalk, Bill's eyes roving as he looked for another house with a bowl on the porch. The houses with people handing out candy were nice and all, but the ones with unattended candy bowls, guarded only by a sign and good manners, were the best. The kids were thinning out now, the unagreed-upon hour that Halloween ended approaching, and that would make it more likely that no one would tattle to their mom if they saw him scooping up bowls. His sack was getting heavy, but he knew there was room for a little more.\n\n\n\n\"Bingo,\" Bill said, seeing a house with a bowl on the porch.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, don't,\" Clyde started to say but Bill was up the stairs and on the porch before he could get it all out. The sign said \"Take Two\" but Bill scoffed as he pushed it over and picked up the bowl. He dumped it into the sack, hefting it back onto his shoulder without even asking Clyde if he wanted any. He would probably be a little baby about it, anyway.\n\n\n\n\"Can we go home now?\" asked Clyde, looking around nervously, \"We're going to get in trouble.\"\n\n\n\n\"You worry too much,\" Bill said, grunting a little as he came down the stairs, \"If they leave the bowl on the porch,\" he explained, tightening his grip on the mouth of the full sack, \"then they ain't coming out to supervise when you take it. They get an empty bowl, we get candy, and everyone wins.\"\n\nClyde seemed unsure but Bill put it out of his mind as they started home. It was five blocks home, and it was gonna be a hike with all these sweet treats bouncing on his back. They parted so a group of kids could make their way up the porch steps, and as they made their way up the sidewalk Bill could hear the disappointed noises from the kids behind them. He shook his head, first come first served, and kept right on walking.\n\n\n\nClyde was quiet, twitching nervously as they headed home. Bill hated it when he did that. His little brother was such a goody-goody that he sometimes worried too much. Clyde always gave them away if he saw you do bad stuff, shaking and stammering and letting momma know that Bill had been up to his old tricks again.\n\n\n\nBill stopped suddenly and opened the sack, reaching in for a piece of candy before finding exactly what he was looking for. One of the last couple of houses had these chocolate peanut butter pumpkins, and Bill wanted one badly. There was one peaking just below the surface of the candy mountain that was pressing at the sides of the bag, and Bill had just started unwrapping it when Clyde spoke up.\n\n\n\n\"Bill! Mom hasn't even checked it yet! What if it's poison or something?\"\n\n\n\nBill rolled his eyes as he bit into the chocolate pumpkin and chewed, relishing the taste, \"Don't be such a baby, Clyde. It's in a wrapper. No one's gonna poison candy in a wrapper. I don't need Momma to check my candy, I can do it myself.\"\n\n\n\nHe hefted the sack again, walking a little faster so Clyde would have to keep up, and thinking about maybe digging out another of the pumpkins. They had moved into a less full part of the sidewalk, the kids mostly gone home by now, and that was probably the only reason he heard it. It was a weird sound, like footsteps right behind him, and Billy turned his head suddenly but found nothing behind them.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Clyde asked, but Bill just shook his head.\n\n\n\n\"Nothin', let's go,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBill started walking faster, but no matter how fast he walked, the sound still followed. It actually quickened as he sped up again, keeping pace with him easily, and a glance behind him showed no one following him. What was this, Bill wondered. Was someone playing a joke on him or...maybe...\n\n\n\nHe shook his head. It was just the idea of Halloween filling his head with nonsense. There was no ghost after him, no spirit hounding his tracks. Maybe he needed a little more candy. Maybe if he just had another piece of Candy he would feel better.\n\n\n\nHe slipped the sack off his shoulder and reached in, but something seemed off. Was the sack emptier than it had been? No, no it couldn't be. He had only taken a single piece out. It just looked that way. There was still so much candy here. It was just his nerves. He took a Kit-Kat out and ate it before pulling the sack back onto his shoulder again.\n\n\n\nAs he started walking, he heard the sound again. Something was following behind him, the *plop plop plop* like worn down shoes as it tailed Bill and Clyde. It was past dark the light from the street lamps providing islands on the sidewalk with widening gulfs of darkness between. Bill felt the hairs on the back of his neck stick up. This couldn't be real, it was impossible. There was no way this could...\n\n\n\n\"Do you hear that?\" Clyde asked, his voice low and scared.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Bill realized that it wasn't just in his head.\n\n\n\nIf Clyde could hear it too, then it had to be real!\n\n\n\n\"Go away!\" Bill shouted, suddenly turning around to confront whatever it was that was following them. He got some strange looks from a couple of kids further up the block, but there was nothing on the sidewalk behind him but a single, brightly wrapped piece of candy. Candy, Bill thought, that would help him settle his nerves. He'd have a Snickers or a Reeses and be better in his mind for sure. He put the bag on the sidewalk, opened the neck, and reached in to get some...\n\n\n\nThe missing candy was obvious this time. Bill had lost about a quarter of his sack somehow and had never even noticed the loss. Was that what the thing was doing? Stealing his candy? But how? How could it be taking candy from his closed bag? It didn't make any sense. He pulled the neck shut without taking anything and threw it back onto his shoulder. It was noticeably lighter now. The weight of it was still there, but it wasn't as heavy as it had been.\n\n\n\n\"Bill? Is something wrong? You look scared.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's go,\" Bill almost gasped out, his teeth chattering as he started walking again.\n\n\n\nRight away came the steps.\n\n\n\n*Pap Pap Pap Pap.*        \n\n\n\nThey were following him, houding him, making him crazy. Why was this happening, he wondered, as the sound chased him. He had just taken some candy. Surely this...whatever it was wasn't haunting him just for treats. That was stupid, it didn't make any sense.\n\n\n\n*Pap pap pap pap*\n\n\n\nHe wanted to run, but what would it do then? His Grandpa had told him on a hunting trip that when you were confronted by a predator, you weren't supposed to run. If you ran it might think you wanted to be chased, and it might get excited. Bill didn't want to be chased. Just then, Bill wanted to be inside his house with the door locked and his blanket over the top of him so whatever monster this was couldn't get him. You were safe under the covers, everyone knew that, and Bill desperately wanted to be safe.\n\n\n\n\"Bill? What,\"\n\n\n\n\"Cross the road,\" he growled at Clyde, and the two of them crossed in the middle of the road, Clyde looking around fitfully as they did so. Jay Walking, Bill thought. How ever would Clyde's record recover from this?\n\n\n\nAnd still, that *pap pap pap* sound followed them across the road.\n\n\n\nThey were about a block from home now, and Bill was starting to feel a little silly about all this.\n\nMaybe he was wrong. Maybe he had just thought he'd seen all that candy gone. There was no way it could actually be gone. He was holding the opening to the bag. He'd put it down and check, and then he'd find the bag still full. That would put his mind at ease.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, why are we stopping?\" Clyde asked, sounding as scared as Bill felt, \"I think we should,\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut up,\" Bill snapped, opening the bag and looking in.\n\n\n\nHis stomach fell, it was worse than he thought. He had been wrong, it wasn't a quarter of the candy. Now, as he looked at the pile of treats inside, it was half of the bag that was now missing. It couldn't be real, there was just no way, but, sure enough, the bag was only half full.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" he moaned, \"No, no, no, no, no, no,\"\n\n\n\nBilly hefted the bag and began to run, Clyde crying for him to wait as he chased after him. He could hear the *pap pap pap* sound behind him and feel the bag getting lighter as he flew along. Clyde was calling his name, trying to get Bill to stop, but Bill was lost to reason. It was taking his candy, it was taking HIS candy! He had to get home, he had to make it to the house before it could get it all. The footsteps were coming faster and faster, chasing him as he rounded the corner and saw the inflatable yard ornaments of home, and knew he was close to the safety of a closed door and the warm lights of his house. The footsteps still chased him, and now he couldn't get two words out of his head as he ran.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the footsteps seemed to whisper to him, and he wondered if the ghost that was chasing him was his own greed.  \n\n\n\n\"Take Two,\" it seemed to say, repeating again and again, and when he finally collapsed on the front porch of his house, panting and shaking, his sack was as slack and empty as it had been when he left.\n\n\n\nWith shaking hands, he opened it, and there he found the proof he had been looking for.\n\n\n\nAt the bottom sat two full-sized chocolate bars, their prize from Mrs. Nesbrook who lived across the street.\n\n\n\nWhen Clyde came puffing up a few minutes later, Bill was crying on the porch, his sack in his lap and his face in his hands.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, Bill what's wrong? Are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no, it's all gone! It took my candy, and it's my own fault. You were right, Clyde. I got greedy. I shouldn't have messed with the rules. Now it's all gone and I,\" but when Clyde started to laugh, it shut him up in a hurry.\n\n\n\nClyde opened his bag and, to Bill's surprise, it was much fuller than it had been.\n\n\n\n\"There's no ghost eating your candy, silly. There's a hole in the bottom of your bag.\"\n\n\n\nBill looked at him in disbelief, \"But...but I heard it. The footsteps,\"\n\n\n\n\"It was the sound of the candy falling out,\" Clyde said, flipping over Bill's bag and showing him the hole in the bottom of his sack. The sack had been at critical mass, Bill supposed, and the candy had made the hole bigger as it bumped around in there as he ran. Bill looked at the hole, dumbfounded, for a moment, and then he started to laugh. He took the candy bars out of the sack and threw the bag away, putting an arm around his brother as the two went inside.\n\n\n\n\"I suppose it serves me right for just taking what I wanted, huh?\" Bill asked, feeling the fear dissipate inside him as he began to feel silly instead.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it's okay,\" Clyde said, \"We can share my bag.\"\n\n\n\nThey spent the rest of the evening eating candy and telling spooky stories. \n\n\n\nAs he sat eating candy, Bill decided that, from now on, he would listen when something told him not to take too much.\n\n"},"94":{"title":"The Mystery of Hornet's Spooklight","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fub9w7\/the_mystery_of_hornets_spooklight\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the eerie legend of Hornet's Spooklight!

It was colder than the rest, and no matter how high I set the thermostat, that part of the living room stayed frigid. I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just the draft from an old window. But sometimes, late at night, I’d feel it—this strange, prickling sensation, like someone was standing there, just out of sight, watching me. I’d glance over quickly, but of course, there was never anything there. It became part of the house, like furniture you get used to but never quite like.\n\nLast night was different. I was locking up the house, doing my usual routine—checking the doors, flipping off the lights—when I felt it again. That creeping chill, that sense that I wasn’t alone. It was colder than usual, almost bitter. I pulled my jacket tighter and glanced toward the window in the corner. The glass was fogged up, which didn’t seem right, not on a night as dry as this.\n\nI stepped closer, squinting through the dim light. That’s when I saw them. Breath marks. Condensation streaking the window as if someone had been standing there, breathing heavily against the glass. But I hadn’t been anywhere near that window all night. My heart gave a heavy thud as I stared at the outline of the fog, trying to make sense of it. I wiped the glass with my sleeve, hoping it would clear, but it only revealed something more unsettling.\n\nThere were two sets of breath marks. One on the inside. And one on the outside.\n\nMy pulse quickened as I stepped back, my mind racing. How could there be breath on the outside? I hadn’t heard anyone approach, hadn’t seen anything. I wanted to brush it off—maybe it was just a trick of the cold—but something about it felt… wrong.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in place, I noticed something else. A faint outline began to take shape, just beyond the glass. It was barely visible, but the longer I stared, the clearer it became—a figure, standing impossibly close to the window. My stomach twisted into knots as I realized it wasn’t a reflection. It was outside.\n\nIts face was almost touching the glass, eyes wide and fixed on mine. I could see the breath clouding from its mouth as it stared, unblinking, completely still. My mind screamed to move, to run, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away. There was something so wrong about its face, something… off. It was too pale, too rigid, like it didn’t belong.\n\nThen, as if sensing my fear, the figure raised a hand and slowly pressed its palm against the window. The glass frosted beneath its touch. My breath caught in my throat, and before I could react, it began to smile. A slow, deliberate smile that stretched far too wide, distorting its face into something unnatural.\n\nAnd then, it tapped on the window. Once. Twice. The sound echoed through the silent room, and my blood ran cold.\n\nI backed away, barely able to breathe, my mind racing for an explanation. But all I could hear was the steady tapping. Then, as I turned to run, I heard it—whispering, faint but unmistakable.\n\n“Let me in.”"},"97":{"title":"The Summoning of Twelve","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fu8g46\/the_summoning_of_twelve\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Proabis","selftext":"You can listen to my Audio version here ; [https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@proabis\/video\/7421028832406260997](https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@proabis\/video\/7421028832406260997)\n\nIt started when I found the book—buried beneath a pile of forgotten relics in the dusty corner of an old bookstore. The pages were cracked and yellowed, the ink barely legible, but one passage caught my eye: a ritual involving twelve candles, each with a purpose. It was titled \"The Summoning of Twelve\" A warning followed in faded script: “Light only in desperation. If you light the 12 candles your deepest desires will be answered, But be warned the price may be more than you can bear.”\n\n\n\nI should have left it alone. But before I could react I was already at the register.\n\n\n\nThe book’s instructions were specific: “The candles must be placed in a perfect circle, with a standing mirror in the center. Each Candle must be lit with the use of a match, light each one, speak its number, and chant the words that bind it. They said it would open a doorway, I would be able to gaze upon eternity and any questions I had would be answered.” As soon as I left the bookstore, the weight of what I’d found gnawed at me, but curiosity pulled me deeper. I bought the twelve candles from a nearby shop, my hands trembling as I handed over the money. Back in my apartment, I set the candles in a ring around my old mirror, careful to measure the circle exactly. I covered all the windows, and turned off any light sources, The darkness felt heavier then usual. I took a deep breath, opened the book to the page, and struck the first match.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne: \"By hand, the path is shown.\" As I lit the first candle, warmth surged through my fingers, grounding me in the growing darkness. But even as the flame flickered, an unsettling chill crept in, like icy fingers brushing against my spine. I could almost hear the shadows whispering secrets just beyond my reach.\n\n\n\nTwo: \"A flame is born, what’s done is done.\" The air thickened, wrapping around me like tendrils of smoke, each breath becoming heavier as I fought the urge to flee. I pressed on, the shadows stretching longer.\n\n\n\nThree: \"The veil grows thin, the shadows creep.\" The room shimmered as if peering through warped glass, reality bending and rippling around me.\n\n\n\nFour: \"From darkest depths, the silence speaks.\" In the mirror, dark figures began to flicker at the edges, their movements dancing in the candlelight. They watched me with empty eyes, their intentions hidden beneath layers of darkness.\n\n\n\nBy the time I reached the fifth candle, an oppressive energy pulsed in the room. My own reflection distorted grotesquely, whispering truths I wasn’t ready to confront.\n\n\n\nFive: \"Their shapes now crawl from depths unknown.\" I felt an electric ripple in the air, a surge of energy that beckoned me to dive deeper. I shuddered, recalling the warning in the book: “Only in desperation.”\n\n\n\nSix: \"In mirrored glass, their faces shown.\" My reflection twisted and writhed, as hollow-eyed figures emerged behind me—tall and gaunt, their features indistinguishable yet familiar.\n\n\n\nPanic clawed at my throat, yet an insatiable curiosity compelled me to continue.\n\n\n\nSeven: \"They whisper names in tongues of night.\" The figures grew clearer, stepping forward, their shapes now undeniable, filled with an otherworldly hunger that sent chills racing down my spine.\n\n\n\nEight: \"Now bound in flesh, they long to be.\" Their faces became starkly visible—twisted, inhuman, and hauntingly familiar, gazing through the glass with a longing that made my heart pound in fear.\n\n\n\nMy hand trembled as I struck the match for the ninth candle, dread pooling in my stomach.\n\n\n\nNine: \"Their voices weave through thread and seam.\" Their voices filled the air, a cacophony of raspy, seductive promises. Each word slithered into my mind, a claw scraping against my sanity, tempting me with secrets I could scarcely comprehend.\n\n\n\nThe tenth candle stood before me, my supposed defense against what lay ahead.\n\n\n\nTen: \"Their promises tear at the edge of dreams.\" But their words were intoxicating—offers of knowledge, power, and a glimpse into the infinite, whispering truths I had long yearned to understand.\n\n\n\nFor a while, I hesitated, teetering on the precipice of choice, the weight of their words heavy in the air.\n\n\n\nEleven: \"But words deceive; the price is high.\" I whispered, summoning every ounce of will I had left, but it was too late. I waited to long.\n\n\n\nThe room erupted with a terrible noise, a howling chorus of anguished souls trapped between worlds. The figures surged from the mirror, their grotesque forms breaking free, surrounding me in a suffocating darkness. I stumbled backward, grasping for the final candle—the one meant to sever the connection.\n\n\n\nMy hand brushed the wick just as the flames snuffed out.\n\n\n\nThe last words of the chant were trapped in my throat, unspoken.\n\n\n\nTwelve: \"Through the mirror’s veil, be gone forevermore!\"\n\n\n\nBut it was already too late. The darkness closed in, and I was no longer sure where I ended and they began."},"98":{"title":"Help! Looking for an older story.

It has been an easy, boring job. At least up until yesterday, that is.\n\nOn day one, I was shown around the factory. My supervisor gave me a walk-through of the entire factory. I saw each department and was given a brief description of what they do there.\n\nAt the end of the day, I was told to come back the next day at 8 am. I was going to start in the boxing department. The last step in the factory.\n\nAll I had to do was pull each case of canned goods off of the conveyor belt, ensure it was sealed, and place it on a pallet. It sounded easy enough.\n\n“What about that room over there? I asked, pointing to a room with fogged windows. I could see conveyor belts going into it and coming out of it. But, unlike the rest of the facility, it was closed off. All the windows were fogged, so you couldn’t see inside.\n\nMy boss sighed and gave me a look that told me he was tired of people asking about that room. “ That room is off-limits. Only restricted personnel are allowed in there.”\nThe next morning I started my shift. About an hour into my shift, I was bored out of my mind. A box came down the conveyor belt and I sealed it and stacked it on a pallet… Another box… sealed it… pallet. I needed a break. I waved at my supervisor and told him I needed a bathroom break. He checked his watch and shook his head.\n“Already?” He asked in a frustrated tone.\n“I’m sorry. Nature calls.” I replied.\nHe stepped over to my conveyor belt. “I’ll cover you until you get back. Just try to be quick.” He snapped.\n\nI walked to the bathroom and turned to make sure I was out of his line of sight. I was. I didn’t have to use the bathroom and stood in front of the bathroom for a second. That’s when I heard the noises. I heard horrible retching noises like someone was throwing up.\nBut the noises weren’t coming from the restroom. They were coming from the room with the fogged windows. I began to creep closer. The noises were becoming louder.\n\nWhen I reached the door I cupped my hands over the class to try to look inside. Someone had to have seen me and the door opened. I almost fell over backward, but I was able to recover.\n\nA middle-aged man wearing the same uniform I had been given stood there staring at me. “You must be Brett, the new guy. You were supposed to be here an hour ago.” He said.\nThe wrenching sound was even louder now with the door open. I could hear other people talking inside the room. I wasn’t Brett, but I needed to see what was going on inside. I knew that when my supervisor noticed I didn’t come back I would be fired. Or worse, if Brett showed up and they figured out I was lying I would be in serious trouble. It was worth it. I hated this job anyways.\nThe man brought me into the room. He pointed to a conveyor belt that led into a machine. “The cans will come in this side, the machine will seal them and they will come out the other side sealed and with a label. Your job is to make sure they are sealed. If you see any leaking pull them and place them in this barrel. Okay?”\n\nI nodded. It was simple. I wanted to look around to see what was causing the noise but the cans began flowing in. Cans of peas were moving into the machine and coming out sealed. I watched them for several minutes and didn’t see any that had failed to seal. But I did notice that all of them were dented. I decided to turn and ask the man what to do with the dented cans. It would be the perfect excuse to look around the room.\n\nAs I turned the corner around a large piece of equipment I saw it. A huge, green insect was standing there. It was easily six feet tall and resembled a praying mantis. The creature was chained to the floor and vomited violently into a fifty-five-gallon barrel. Two men were scooping the vomit and pouring small amounts into each can of peas as they passed by.\nI screamed in disgust. The man who had led me into the room turned to me. He ran over and began to yell at me. You need to get back to your station. If one of those can get through unsealed it can ruin everything. Within hours of being exposed to air, these eggs can hatch.” He screamed at me,\n\n“Eggs? What the fuck is that thing?” I demanded.\n“Fuck. Tom didn’t brief you before he sent you down here?” He asked.\nI said nothing I just stared in horror at the giant insect.\n\n“Yeah, eggs. That thing is an alien. We have an arrangement with their species. It stays here, lays eggs and we spread them through the food chain. We estimate about one in a hundred eggs that are consumed by a human will hatch, consuming the human from within.” He explained.\n\n“Why would you do this?” I asked. I wanted to puke. The huge insect was staring at me while it continued to vomit.\n\n“Brett, you were supposed to have been up to speed already. We don't have a choice. They supply us with tech and we have to offer hosts to incubate their offspring. The cans are dented so we can track how many we put into circulation. And at least the only people that will be lost are poor people and cheap people looking for a bargain.” He told me.\nThat was it. I couldn’t hold back anymore. I ran to the trash can and vomited.\nThe man patted me on the shoulder. “Brett, I need you to get back to your station. Besides, it’s not half as bad as what they're doing with the corn.”\n\n"},"100":{"title":"Need help to find teeth","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fuaoeq\/need_help_to_find_teeth\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Aries_CreativeSoul","selftext":"Hey :) i wanted to cosplay  \"Laughing jack\" but i can't find teeth he have, does anyone knows what does \"teeth\" called?

It was an American sitcom that aired in 1964 with three seasons and 99 episodes, two being in black and white and the latter in color, which started in 1965; Let me summarize what the show is about: There's a two-man crew on the charter boat SS Minnow and five passengers on a 3-hour tour from Honolulu who run into a typhoon and are shipwrecked on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific.\n\nThat’s all the plot is, I did get that information from Wikipedia, and honestly, the show isn’t bad to watch, but there's an episode of Gilligan’s Island that has never been released by CBS Productions because of its disturbing nature. It wasn't violent; no, it was just disturbing to watch compared to the rest of the show.\n\nThe episode was listed as the 100th episode of the series before the show was canceled and added to the pit of forgotten shows, but this episode was not forgotten.\n\nI'm going to share some information about this episode, but promise me that you won't laugh. The episode is called \"Gilligone Island\" like the name of the show but of course, the pun. It might’ve been a test episode; I really don't know. But now that we’re done talking about the name, let's focus on the main plot. I will tell you this since I actually have the full episode saved on my computer.\n\nThe episode starts like any other, with Gilligan and the rest getting stranded on an island, but this one, which has never been seen in the show before, looks abandoned and forgotten, and the episode starts right away with Gilligan and The Skipper being the only people on the island.\n\nThey started exploring, and it isn't long before they saw a bunch of spiders and bones on the ground.\n\nThe exploration continues, and Gilligan finds the corpse of a man, presumably someone who died. Skipper and Gilligan were starving, so they grabbed a knife and plunged it into one of the bodies; he gives half of the organs to the skipper, and he eats the rest. I mean, it sounds weird, I know, but I suppose in this case, it's necessary for survival.\n\nI was figuring out how they could leave the island until the camera pans to the boat being damaged.\n\nKeep in mind that I haven't watched many other episodes of this show; I watched it with my parents on a few occasions, but I'm currently researching this show as I am typing this, and I just found this episode. To my belief, this show is indeed family-friendly, so my guess is that they wouldn't be showing cannibalism.\n\nGilligan continued eating the organs with The Skipper, and Gilligan puts his clothes on the skeleton because his outfit got dirty from the bloody feast; he's naked, uncensored, and dirty and bloody. I am wondering if this episode might’ve been targeted for an older audience unlike the rest of the show, and this is where the main part of the episode comes in.\n\nGilligan and the Skipper start to fix the boat to get back to the island; they're looking for parts, and don't find any. Gilligan breaks the shed down and uses the shed parts to make the boat. Gilligan then passes out due to dehydration; he is not dead and the skipper notices and gives him water.\n\nGilligan drinks it, but he's also hungry. He apologizes to the skipper as he picks up a rock and starts beating his hand, causing blood to come out. He groans in pain, and Gilligan puts a bandage on his hand. He eats the bloody pieces from it.\n\nThe next scene shows them starting to build a campfire to get warm.\n\nGilligan and the skipper were lying near the fire. The skipper starts yelling and starts punching Gilligan suddenly; he bit a piece of his arm off and screamed in agony. After this scene ends, Gilligan puts his clothes on because he kept complaining about things going into his groin in the scene.\n\nHe then start fixing the boat again, and it's at this point that they finally got off the island. The episode cuts to black with the credits, and I was thankful that this ended more happily at least, least more of a resolution anyway but I still don't know what to think about the rest of this episode.\n\nWhy would CBS make this in the first place?\n\n# Update:\n\nI googled this episode on IMDB, and found nothing except Gilligan, the Goddess from 1967, being in the last part of season 3, not season 4. I used the Wayback Machine, and I found something.\n\nThere was no rating, and the genre of \"Comedy and Family\" was like the rest of the episodes but here's what the description read:\n\n\"Gilligan and The Skipper got stuck on an island, and they need to take what was there to survive. Will they die or make trouble for one another?\"\n\nThere were no photos, and of course, the top two actors, Gilligan, played by Bob Denver, and The Skipper, played by Alan Hale Jr., had nothing unusual about them, everything else was the same, unusual, but the same, I noticed that the reviews were not very good.\n\nThe Gilligone Island set was burned to the ground in real life, yes, it was a

carriers with 3 extra magazines for our AR15s and clipping on our side holsters for our Glock 19s and lastly our helmets only rated to stop small calibers but strong enough to take blunt force if necessary and of course nvgs with it being abandoned and all.\n\n“10-4 Jax were not to sure what class this is so precede with caution” \n\n“Great” Sydney says knowing the potential danger since we have almost no information other then that recently some “explorers” had went missing\n\n“Yall know the drill, search and rescue if they’re alive but our main objective is exterminating the anomaly” I say to my team \nRyan just nods his head never being much of a talker but most big guys aren’t and he was at-least 6ft5inches\n\nWalking into the building I say something into my radio along the lines of we’re entering the building, flipping on the nvgs the tall dark hallway lights up green as we start to enter, there’s a front desk with a long hallway behind it that looked to separate into 6 other small halls for the patient rooms and a kitchen on the far left side.\n\nIgnoring the kitchen we start heading down the long hallway planning to start from the back of the hospital and make our way up to the front as we step over broken glass and push empty beds out our way we head to the end of the hall planning to start on the side hall to the right since the other seemed to be mostly empty with only what looks like the remains of the rehab part of the hospital, heading down the hall we stop at room 1 and see nothing inside or out, pulling out my scanner to check the anomaly rating to see nothings going off which repeats for every room till we reach room 6 the last door on the right.\n\nBefore opening the door the device starts beeping like crazy, silencing it we all turn to each other and prepare to breach and enter the room, me taking point I slowly open the door stepping into a room that looks like it was never abandoned, we did a double take and yep a completely normal looking hospital room, stepping in we see nothing till we see a bathroom door which we prepare to breach as I hear something moving around in there.\n\n“I’ll take point” I whisper nodding to Sydney and Ryan, kicking the door open I see what looks to be a 1980s era looking nurse cleaning the bathroom\n\n“Umm hello” I say to the lady who hasn’t even turned around to acknowledge our presence\n\n“Hello” I say louder reaching to grab their shoulder and spin them around, but when I do what turns around was almost normal except the face, the hair, nails, body, everything about her or it was normal atleast for the time period we assume it’s from but the face, it had wide black eyes with a single white dot that I assume was its pupal, a mouth that hung open like something from the Evil dead, and ears that leaked black goo, and a skull like nose.\n\nIt screeched an unholy sound as I step back readying my rifle before it shoots I guess shock waves from its mouth sending me flying out the door slamming into the wall on the other side of the room, Sydney and Ryan step forward raising their weapons before Sydney’s flys back barely missing me but not missing the wall and Ryan’s gun gets knocked out his hand as he reaches for his pistol, it grabs him screaming into his ear as he tries to fight its grasp but in a second he drops.\n\nThinking quick I grab Sydney and run out the room \n\n“So physical isn’t an option he overpowered Ryan in a second” Sydney says as we run towards the middle of the long hall looking for a spot to set up\n\n“Yea we need to keep distance I say as we flip a bed in the hall and hunker down waiting for the creature to walk into sight”\n\n“My nvgs broke” Sydney says frustrated \n“Switch to flashlights” I say flipping up the nvgs and clicking the button on the side of my rifle, the now lit hallway shows nothing but emptiness when we hear in a singsongy \nvoice\n “what can Ms.Mary help you with” in a low scraggly voice which repeats over and over as we ready ourselves \n\nWe see it enter the hall way as we take aim and light the bastard up, it drops for about 10 seconds before slowly picking itself up repeating “what can Ms.Mary help you with”\n\nRushing down the hall we switch mags as it runs towards us faster then any animal alive could, jumping to the side we see it rush pass us and stops we flick off our lights hoping it would conceal us as we slowly slide our back to the corner of the hall behind it when I drop the old spent mag I had previously just used when we see the creature not even flinch at the noise, noticing I lean down slowly and pick the mag up and preceded to throw it down the opposite direction and see the creature still hasn’t moved.\n\n“I don’t think it can hear us” I whisper to Sydney as we now are speed walking backwards down the hall, when the creature starts to turn and look around presumably searching for us, slipping into a room we shut the door.\n\n“How are we getting out of this one” Sydney says looking at the barred windows\n\n“I have no clue” I say stepping towards the back wall\n\n“One of us can try to distract it while the other lines up a shot” I say looking into her eyes wondering if after today I’ll ever be able to express how I feel about her\n\n“Look I know it’s dumb to think about this right now especially with everything going on and it being against protocol, but how about a date if we make it out of this” I say cautiously \n\n“Sure, but you know that means we gotta kill this bitch” she says smiling \n\n“Okay” I say with new found confidence, I’ll go distract it, you line up the shot I say as I rush out the door, spraying shots at the creature down the opposite hall\n\nRunning towards the creature it stretches its mouth wider and sprints towards me screeching \n“WHAT CAN MS.MARY HELP YOU WITH!” \n\nRight before we collide in the middle of the hall I turn left shooting behind me as it chases me I hear Sydney’s feet running down the hall I just came from, diving to the ground In front of me I turn and spray the last of my mag into the creatures chest as Sydney runs up behind it stuffing the barrel to the back of its head and empty’s the gun.\n\nThe creature drops as we start reloading our weapons I pull out my pistol and put a few extra in just in case, we radio over “Ryan’s kia but we got the creature preceding towards the entrance to await the clean up crew” \n\nWalking away we hear a faint “wha- what can Ms.Mary help you with” spinning around the creature had already picked itself up and grabbed Sydney by the head lifting her up, charging the creature I scream “PUT HER DOWN!” I try to tackle the beast before being knocked away like I weigh less than a feather and slamming the side of my body so hard into the wall it cracks and breaks my arm.\n\n“Yelling in pain I look to see the creature slowly rip Sydney’s head clean off as she screams and screams and then silence\n\nSobbing I lift myself up clinching my arm I sprint down the hall only looking back for a second but I wish I didn’t, it-it was eating her, I turn the corner and slam my good arm into the door busting out as soon as back up arrived but I don’t know how they fared against the creature, I passed out only after.\n\n“I awoke to find myself back at home base and that’s everything I remember doc”\n\n“Well Jax, it seems you were very lucky, will ignore your breach of protocol given the fact you watched her die in-front of you but next time don’t get so attached sgt”\n\n“Yes sir” I said softly clicking off the recorder in my pocket \n\n“At least everyone can know your sacrifice Sydney” I whisper to myself before walking out."},"106":{"title":"All she heard was \"Tock...

Her parents were at a party, so she had decided to make the most of her free time. Unfortunately, her 5-year-old little sister, Léa, was also at home. Indeed, since the beginning of the evening, the little one had come down from her room to see her big sister three times: the first time because she was thirsty, the second because she wanted her to tell her a story, and the third because she had seen a \"tall dark figure\" in the garden. Jessica, patient, had fetched a glass from the kitchen, read Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Léa, and circled the garden three times before asserting that there was no \"tall dark figure.\" Once this inspection was complete, she put her sister back to bed, telling her it was time to sleep.\n\nSo, she had been sitting there for ten minutes when suddenly:\n\n\"Jessica?\"\n\nWith a sigh, she turned around and saw her little sister, with sleepy eyes and her stuffed animal in hand, behind the couch. She signaled for her to join her, and the little one settled on the couch, cuddling up to her.\n\n\"What's wrong now?\" her big sister asked.\n\n\"I had a nightmare.\"\n\n\"I already told you there's no one in the garden.\"\n\nSuddenly, the movie Jessica was watching stopped, and a man in a suit appeared:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I'm sorry to interrupt your program, but the psychiatric hospital in the region has just informed us of the escape of an extremely dangerous madwoman, responsible for 6 extremely violent murders. She has not been incarcerated but placed under observation due to her mental state. She is wheelchair-bound and unable to walk. If you see her, do not approach her under any circumstances, do not attempt anything, and immediately call the police, who will respond as quickly as possible. Lock yourselves in and inform your loved ones. Thank you for your attention.\"\n\nJessica turned pale. Indeed, the hospital was just a few streets away from her home. She was paralyzed with fear. Then suddenly, she snapped out of it. She got up, closed the living room shutters, went to the kitchen and drew the curtains of the sliding glass door, inspected her parents' bedroom window, locked the front door, and went upstairs to close the bathroom and her sister's bedroom windows, which were slightly ajar.\n\nWhen she had finished, she put her little sister to bed and got into bed herself. A few minutes later, she heard a knock on her door: once again it was Lea, who wanted to sleep with her. Jessica agreed. A few minutes later, the little girl announced that she was going to sleep under the bed, so that the madwoman wouldn't find her.\n\nDuring the night, half asleep, Jessica heard strange noises: \"Tock... Tock...\", followed by rubbing... She told herself that it was Lea having a restless sleep. She took no notice.\n\nThe next morning, when she got up, she went directly downstairs to see her parents. She entered the dining room and saw her father sitting at his breakfast table, reading the newspaper. She greeted him and started telling him about the events of the previous evening. When she realized he wasn't responding, Jessica approached and took the newspaper from his hands. He was dead... The young girl stifled a scream of horror. In tears, she called for her mother and ran to the kitchen, where she found the shattered glass door and an overturned wheelchair...\n\nShe then headed to the bathroom: her mother was there, in the bathtub also dead.\n\nThen, she thought of her sister and rushed up the stairs. She opened her sister's bedroom door and hurriedly checked under the bed: her little sister was there, lifeless... Next to her were two knives, and she then understood the strange noises from the night: the madwoman had used her wheelchair to break the window and had moved around using the knives, stabbing them into the floor and pulling herself..."},"107":{"title":"Clockwork’s backstory?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ftvaq2\/clockworks_backstory\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Plormp013","selftext":"Hi!

I couldn't believe it and I found it just laying around on my bed. The things that it said about me and I couldn't believe that it was really bashing. Apparently I wasn't looking after my kidney well enough and I was eating things and doing activities that were really damaging towards it. I became angry and I started doing more things that that were damaging to my kidneys, then I found an update on the diary from my kidneys. Then were really trashing me loads this time round. \n\nI ignored it and I didn't care anymore and then I found a diary written from my heart. My heart wrote down of how I am exercising enough or eating heart healthy food. It really was telling me how I was an incredibly unhealthy and reckless person.

At the same I found another which was written from my joints, they said that I was putting a lot of weight on them by being large. \n\nHow dare they say such bad things about me and how dare they do such a thing towards me.

I opened the mail and it said: “Hello! You have been chosen to test my Pokemon Fan game! It will arrive at your house in a few minutes. -From Annonomys.” I sat there confused. How did they get my address? And why did they choose ME to test their game? I sighed and continued to surf the web, not believing in any of this BS.\n\n        A few minutes later I heard the doorbell ring, I went to see who it was but when I opened the door I saw a small package…I grabbed it and took it inside, then opened it. Inside was a game cartridge for a GBA, ‘Pokemon Posioned Purple’. No, I must be dreaming right? There is no way that email meant it…\n\n        I sighed, It's here now so I should play it. I went to my room with the game and dug through my old stuff to find my GBA; when I found it I put the game and started it.\n\nIt looked like a FireRed\/LeafGreen fan game, which was awesome. The title screen had the game name ‘Poisoned Purple’ and instead of a Charizard or Venusaur in the front, it's an Arbok. That's neat.\n\nI pressed ‘Start’ and ‘New Game’ but instead of getting greeted by Professor Oak, I was greeted by a red-haired lady with a blueish-white sun hat standing in front of the gym. Was she a challenger? Why was she dressed like that? Some dialogue went through, the text box was mostly her speaking when a few words caught my eye…\n\n        “I'm so happy to be the gym leader here in Fuchsia City! It's always been my dream!” Wait.. wasn't Koga the gym leader? I kept playing until I saw someone who seemed to be Koga walk up to this girl. He talked to her about the gym rules, badges, and other stuff. So this girl was the gym leader..before Koga? I was finally able to play, I saw I was playing as the girl so I pulled up her Trainer Card but instead, it said ‘Gym Leader License.’ I read her information and it said:\n\n‘Name: Eleanor\nAge: XX\nGender: F\nGym Leader for Fuchsia City\nPokemon Type: Poison\nPokemon: Arbok (♂), Venomoth (♀), Gengar (♀), Nidoking (♂), Victreebell (♂), Tentacruel (♀)’\n\n        Her avatar shows that she has long red hair and her bangs even cover her eyes so I don't even know what they look like. She also had dark red hair and some long bangs that covered her eyes but not the bottom half of her face. She also has a long light gray dress and a dark blue long-sleeve jacket to go with it, some fishnets and some grey high heels boots, white gloves, and to top it all off, a light gray sunhat with a pink ribbon and a mini flower in it. So she is the gym leader huh? I'm playing as a Gym leader. I have full control of her Pokemon selection, move selection, etc. There are times where I can't do anything like choose my first Pokemon to go with, heal up when the Pokemon are at low health, etc. but I have full control of the move selection. I win some battles, I lose some, but I'm not one of those salty, competitive Pokemon players. I have fun when battling and I find it enjoyable to be controlling a gym leader's battles and handing out gym badges.\n\n        After a day of battling, Eleanor headed back to her home, as she entered I would see someone familiar..\n\n        The person walked up to Eleanor. \"Sure took you long enough,\" they said. There was silence before Eleanor spoke up, \"Silver please it was my first day, of course I'd take long!\" Wait Silver? Not only is Eleanor a gym leader but she also knows Silver. I analyze both but keep reading the dialogue. I noticed Ells's hair is a darker shade of red than Silver, they look...related. \"Whatever sis come on! Fight me in a Pokemon battle!\" Silver said. Sis...so they were related. After I got into a battle with Silver, I barely won. \"Oh come on I was so close!\" said Silver. \"Don't worry little bro, you'll beat me someday!\" said Eleanor. Silver is Ells's little brother...that's adorable.\n\n(credits to owner and creator of Glitchy Red btw)\n\n        The game cut to black and there was a text that said '5 years later' Then it cut back to Eleanor in her gym, waiting for a challenger. Then someone who looked like Red came in, but I was starting to feel uneasy seeing this 'Red' guy. The 2 talked, while reading the dialogue it looked weirdly wholesome and all but then there was a battle. I snapped out of my trance and got ready to fight to battle this guy... 'Trainer? G̵̯͊L̸̗̇Ḯ̵̪T̵̼̈C̴͓̎H̶̖̊Y̶͖͗ ̸̯͛Ṛ̷̾E̵̫͊D̷̢̛ would like to battle!' I could barely read the name but from what I could make out the name was 'Glitchy Red'. What an odd name. We would battle, 'Red's' team didn't consist of his normal team, this time it was a Porygon, Pikachu, Pinsir, Snorlax, Magneton and Kabutops. He sent out his Kabutops first while Ell sent out her Venomoth...the battle begins\n\n        The battle was intense but down to 2 Pokemon now, 'Red's' Porygon and Eleanor's Arbok, Ell was up more in health while Red was more in the yellow\/red zone in health. I was sweating, fully engaged in this battle. The Porygon was poisoned, giving me an advantage so I made Arbok use Earthquake and defeated the Porygon, making me successful in the battle. \"......\" was said from 'Red's' dialogue box. Eleanor and 'Red' would sit there for a while before Ell struck up a conversation, they talked but 'Red' wasn't talking as much then when he was about to leave but the game suddenly froze and glitched for a second before returning to normal. I didn't think about it too much and thought it was my device since it was in a dusty box for a very long time so I continued playing. While Ell was wandering her gym her Arbok wasn't following her, it was just staying in place while she was tidying up the place. She didn't pay any attention to it but I did, I would see it glitch slightly but not often. I was getting concerned.\n        \n        \n\nAfter Eleanor was finished cleaning and tidying up her gym for the day and was about to leave, her Arbok didn't even budge. It was still in that spot, looking lifeless yet it was still slightly glitching. It was a little hard to see from the dimness of the screen of the dark room but I could still make out what was going on. Eleanor later spoke: \"Arbok? come on let's go, I need to heal you and the others up. Plus I need to start making dinner for you guys and Silver.\" Arbok still didn't budge, it only let out a small hiss and a low 'Bok' noise. Eleanor took out Arboks Pokeball and tried to return him but he smacked the ball away and hissed loudly, he was getting aggressive and I don't know why... Ell started panicking and started pacing around the room but right when she was moving, Arbok decided to start attacking her for no reason.\n\n        I was shocked and also started panicking, I liked Eleanor as a character and I didn't want to see anything happen to her. So I mashed buttons, even if it didn't help, it was all I could do. Arbok was crushing her while she was squirming there helpless and confused. Later Arbok released a weakened Ell and she slowly got up, the game started going in control by itself because the menu opened up, and seems like Eleanor revived her Venomoth and got into a battle with Arbok. All I could do was watch.\n\n        The battle was fully controlled by Eleanor yet she seems to be unaware of this 4th wall break. Her Arbok was close to low health but then something unexpected happened... 'ARBOK used Poison Fang!' and it missed Venomoth but instead it hit Eleanor! 'Gym Leader ELEANOR was poisoned!' A separate health bar appeared which seemed to be Eleanors, it was draining slowly and Ell seemed to be getting weaker. Arbok kept targeting Eleanor with his attacks and would mostly miss since Venomoth would distract him. Yet there was this weird move that no Pokemon can learn... 'ARBOK used STRANGULATION'. Arbok then wrapped himself around Eleanor (mostly her neck) and squeezed himself very tightly on her, the health draining quickly now...I was panicking even more and even started sweating, I selected Venomoth and then selected her moveset and selected 'Bug Bite' as fast as I could. Venomoth quickly responded after I clicked the move and bit down on Arboks scales many times, she seemed to have bitten him so hard that some spurts of blood flew out of the bitted area. Arbok let out a loud cry of pain that was pretty loud and it made me happy that I was home alone because I'm sure other people would've heard it if it wasn't just me in the house. Arbok released Eleanor and then just sat there, the battle didn't seem to be done yet even if Arbok wasn't even moving...\n\n        Arboks color became more dull and he started to glitch out more. his fangs got sharper and his eyes became all black. a dialogue box from Eleanor popped up. \"Venomoth....u-use..Sleep Powder...\" Venomoth quickly obeyed and sprayed Sleep Powder all over Arbok and he surprisingly fell asleep. Eleanor took control again and she seems to have pulled out a..a MASTER BALL? Where did she get one of those?! \"You need to be contained..\" She said as she threw the Master Ball and recaught her now glitched and killing machine of a Pokemon. the battle screen faded back to the now bloodied gym from the violent Bug Bites and some purple poison was dripping from Eleanor's sprite, seemingly from when Arbok poisoned her. Eleanor shuffled through her stuff and luckily found an antidote. She quickly chugged it down, she was cured of poisoning but her neck was still weak...she weakly got up and stumbled out of the gym, Venomoth following behind...\n\nI would notice a shadowy figure from the corner of the room..\n\nit looked like that 'Red' guy...\n\nA dialogue box popped up...\n\n\"....\"\n\n\"Im sorry..\"\n\nThe screen faded to black...\n\n'A few months later...'\n\n        After that whole incident, I was devastated. I didn't know what to say but after seeing that time skip, I thought to myself, 'What happened since then?' as the screen faded in; Eleanor was in her room, she seemed to have locked herself in. She was in bed, not moving. the Master Ball on one of her room shelves it looked dull and looked like it had no life. It would glitch slightly but nothing would happen. \n        \n        Nothing was happening for a while so I would talk about the game now. I like it but all of the twists made me a bit sad. After being in my head for a while the sound of the dialogue box startled me and it seemed to be coming from outside of Eleanor's room. I'm sure it was Silver since it was just nagging her since that's what siblings do, but this time the text is acting like he's concerned.. After some reading, it showed that Ell hasn't been doing her hobbies anymore. She even quit being a gym leader because she didn't want anyone to get hurt since her ace Pokemon it a violent threat to her challengers and nearly killed someone while battling.\n\nThe screen was later cut to black and was back at the title screen. Arbok looked like how it did in the battle and the title screen was all glitched out. I clicked start and saw the two options, 'New Game' and 'Continue', I clicked 'Continue' and the game glitched and a text box appeared.\n\n\n\n'You don't want to keep making her suffer, do you?'\n\n\n\nI clicked 'New Game', the screen froze and another text box appeared\n\n\n\n'Why do you wanna see it all over again? The past is in the past. There is nothing you can do now.'\n\n\n\nI turned off my game and sighed\n\n\n\nWas this the end?"},"110":{"title":"Cold Grip","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ftmlsr\/cold_grip\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"PageTurner627","selftext":"The night was heavy, the kind of thick, humid Philly summer night that sticks to your skin like sweat and gasoline. I was less than two weeks away from starting med school at Temple. And this was my last shift as an EMT—one last hurrah before I put this life behind me. But I guess the universe had other plans. It always does.\n\nIt was around 2 AM when the call came in. Overdose—Rittenhouse Square. I glanced at my partner, Dan, and we exchanged tired nods. We were used to OD calls. In this city, they were as frequent as the breath we took.\n\nWhen we arrived, I grabbed the Narcan from the kit, thinking this would be a quick in-and-out. But as we approached, the scene was wrong. It wasn’t just one body—it was two. They were huddled together on the park bench, both motionless. The streetlights flickered overhead, casting eerie shadows across their pale faces. One was a young guy, mid-twenties maybe, his head lulled back against the bench. The other was a girl, just as young, her face buried in his chest.\n\nDan stepped forward, kneeling beside them. “Shit, Priya, they’re cold,” he muttered, nudging the guy’s arm. “We’re too late.”\n\nWe should’ve called it then, but I started working on them. They were too far gone, though. There was no saving them. Still, we had to try, right? That’s what we’re trained to do—save lives.\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off the girl. Her skin was the first thing that told me something was wrong. It wasn’t just pale from death—it had this sickly, grayish hue that reminded me of the color of storm clouds just before a tornado. But worse than that were the marks.\n\nI knelt beside her, and as I pulled her away from the guy’s chest, I saw them. Jagged bite marks dotted her arms, her neck, and her collarbone, as if something had gnawed at her flesh. They weren’t clean like an animal attack, though. These looked human, the teeth marks unmistakable, but they had dug in deep, tearing the skin in a grotesque, almost desperate way. Blood had pooled around the edges of the wounds, dark and coagulated, long dried.\n\nI reached for her hand, and that’s when her eyes snapped open.\n\n“Fuck!” I jumped back, my heart pounding. Her grip was ice-cold and iron-strong. She yanked me forward with unnatural force, her mouth opening in a twisted smile. Her teeth—oh God, they were sharp. Too sharp.\n\n“Dan! Help me!”\n\nDan turned just as the girl sat up, still clutching my wrist. Her eyes were bloodshot, wide, and wild. She snarled like an animal. I tried to pull away, but her grip tightened. Dan grabbed my shoulder, trying to wrench me free, but she was stronger than both of us combined.\n\n“Get the hell off her!” Dan screamed, reaching for his radio. But before he could call for backup, the guy next to her stirred. His eyes opened too—milky, glazed over, like something dead brought back to life.\n\nThe girl leaned closer, her breath rancid, like rotting meat. “It’s so cold…” she whispered, her voice raspy and wet. Then she lunged.\n\nShe bit into my arm. The pain was searing, blood spilling instantly. I screamed and punched her in the face, knocking her backward, but she barely flinched.\n\nDan swung his flashlight, cracking her across the head. She let go, and I stumbled back, clutching my arm, feeling the warmth of my blood spilling down to my wrist.\n\n“We need to get out of here!” Dan yelled, pulling me to my feet.\n\nThe guy was on his feet now, swaying, his head lolling unnaturally. The girl crouched, growling, ready to lunge again.\n\nWe ran for the ambulance, slamming the doors shut behind us. I fumbled with the keys, my hands shaking, blood soaking the seat. Dan was yelling into the radio, calling for backup, but all I could hear was the pounding of my heart.\n\nIn the rearview mirror, I saw them standing there, watching us. Their heads twisted at odd angles, smiles stretching across their faces.\n\n“Drive,” Dan said, breathless, his eyes wide with fear. “Just fucking drive.”\n\nI floored it, the ambulance tearing down the streets.

They have been having trouble on their farm (dont remember what kind, maybe cattle dying? Can't remember) and so go out into the woods with guns to find whatever is causing the problem. I think they were expecting coyotes or wolves. Instead they find a humanoid creature eating a deer. When it notices them it jumps on the father, attacking him. The narrator is able to get it off by shooting it, though this doesn't kill it, only wounds it. The narrator grabs his dad and runs out of the woods, arriving back to the farm where there are adults hanging out outside. They see the dad half dead, and are forced to retreat inside when the creature comes out of the woods along with several others. From here I can't remember much except for one specific part where one of the creatures is able to get its hand through a door, they are trying to close the door on its hand, and they press a shotgun to its wrist and shoot the hand off. I also specifically remember that after the creatures go away the police show up, they give the cops the hand of the creature but at the end of the story it is revealed that the cop who had the hand crashed, and the hand had disappeared once the car's wreckage is found."},"112":{"title":"Weird new YouTube project","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ftlgne\/weird_new_youtube_project\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Necessary_Custard677","selftext":"Starting a YouTube thing.

Wispy clouds sprayed across the sky. The kind that look so far away that you are reminded of the sheer scale of our planet. Shades of purple fill the horizon, with a dome of majestic blue. My friend and I walk and discuss the oddly picturesque sky, a change of pace from the overcast weather of the week before. \n\n  \n\"Lets go somewhere with a view! Would be such a shame to waste this sunset\", he says, with an adventurous tone.\n\nI quickly think about what kind of a view we could achieve in a short period of time, after all we only had about an hour of sunlight left. Then I remembered the place I had discovered a year prior, a little parking lot not 20 minutes away with an elevated ocean view, perfect for seeing such a sky.\n\nThe drive there was uneventful, but we couldn't stop looking at the sky, it was almost hypnotizing in its sprawling multicolor. Upon arriving, we found the lot empty, which was a little strange given how perfect the spot was for sunsets. We didn't think anything of it. \n\nSurrounding the parking lot was a thin forest, with a clearing at the ocean-side giving us a sneak peak of the panoramic view. As we stepped out of the car, the crisp fall air hit my nose, and the silent oceanside was only interrupted with the \\*thump\\* of our doors.\n\nAs we approached the view, I was reminded why it was so quiet. The elevation comes from the lot being on a cliff overlooking the ocean. You don't usually think about it, but the ocean has zero possibility of echo, so combined with being so far above the water you cant hear the waves, the effect is borderline eerie.\n\nThe view was perfect. All of the sky which was obstructed in our neighborhood was now visible, it was like someone cleared off the table. By now the colors were unbelievable. Magenta, gold, blue, white, all overlaid and blending. We stood there for a few minutes, silently taking it all in.\n\nWe didnt want to leave.\n\nThe colors began to change faster as the sunset was concluding, like a fireworks grand finale. \n\nThere was something off. The clouds were not changing brightness. It was like someone had forgot to take the spotlight off of them. As the colors faded faster and faster, approaching black, they remained there plastered. Stark white. No stars were visible, just black. The timing of it all didnt make any sense. I checked my watch to see that we had been there for an hour at this point.\n\n\"What the fuck? Dude we've been here for an hour.\" It felt like 15 minutes. As I turn to my friend, I immediately could tell that something was wrong. He didn't react to me at all, and his eyes didn't leave the sky. The colors were gone. It was just pitch black, with the white clouds beaming at us. \n\nThese clouds looked like something between bones and diamonds. A panoramic web of shimmering, sharp white. Suddenly, the clouds felt like they were suffocating me, getting closer and closer. I was stuck in a state of sheer terror and profound curiosity.\n\nA middle peak formed, clearly closer to us than the rest. It continued to extrude until finally, going towards my still silent friend, was a long, shimmering tendril. \n\nIt stopped in front of him for a moment. \n\nI frantically grabbed to pull him away, but he was immovable, like a concrete statue.\n\nThe tendril exploded into a white net, attaching itself to his front. In a display of frightening, incomprehensible power, a mix of his blood, flesh, and clothes flew up the tendril, hundreds of miles away in a few seconds.\n\nThe tendril slowly retreated back into the web, leaving nothing but his shoeprints in the grass.\n\n"},"114":{"title":"Smile.

Then it begins.\n\nOur pet floats.\n\nIt rises, slowly, six feet, like something's pulling it upward from the bones, invisible strings, and then it drops.\n\nThe thud isn't right. It's hollow, like the sound you hear inside a coffin when you knock on it but theres a deep bass that turns into a slight ring. My wife screams, she runs to it, but I... I seemingly dont react. Something else crawls into me, something black and pulsing, Wrath. and all I can taste is blood. I leap, my body moving on its own, tearing down the hallway. I don’t even feel my legs, don’t even think. Only violence. The walls pulse, the ceiling bends inward, but I keep running.\n\nThe hallway stretches, then contracts, until my vision fades. The world blinks out—black, pitch.\n\nBut I know. I know where it is.\n\nThe garage.\n\nI feel it before I see it. A shadow. Eight feet tall, maybe more, slender, and wrong. No face, no features, just... void. It oozes into my vision, like something that was always there, watching, waiting.\n\nI lose control. Rage spills out of me, my hands twitch, claws now, fists gone. I tear into it, teeth gnashing, ripping, until it feels like I'm swimming in blood, in shadows, in something far worse than either.\n\nAnd then—I’m somewhere else.\n\nThe walls are white. No, gray. Fading in and out. I'm standing in a veterinary clinic. The kind with too many windows, too much light that feels wrong. It's nearly dark outside, but inside, the air feels sick, stagnant, like it’s been breathing for centuries. The buildings nearby are distant shadows, too far to mean anything.\n\nI look out the farthest window, and the world warps.\n\nSomething... hops into view. A thing. A rabbit? No. Not that. It’s drawn, crudely, like a child’s nightmare scrawled in black crayon. It bounces. Slowly, too slowly. No features, no eyes, just a nothing of a creature—wrong. My legs refuse to move. I am frozen, a scream trapped in my throat, waiting to surface but never coming.\n\nAnd it runs.\n\nIt disappears, then I hear it—around me, everywhere, in the walls, under the floors, inside my skull. Soft moans, soft screams. I know the sound, the feeling. It’s always been here. It has always been part of me. The ringing begins, faint at first, growing louder, louder, until it’s everything.\n\nI can’t breathe. I can’t hear anything else. I can’t see. I run. I run because that’s all there is left. I run and the world bends, folds in on itself, time smears, days stretch into hours, hours into forever.\n\nI find the shed. I slam the door. But it’s laughing. The laughter isn't right. It’s inside, outside, everywhere at once. I scream into my hands, but no sound comes. I curl into myself, smaller and smaller, until I’m nothing.\n\nThe laughter grows. And the ringing. The ringing—god, the ringing won't stop.\n\nColors twist around me, mocking, screaming without sound. I feel like I’m sinking, drowning in air. There’s nothing but the ringing, everything is the ringing. Smell, touch, sound.\n\nThe world fades.\n\nAnd then—\n\nI wake.\n\nI don’t know how long it’s been. My head throbs. My phone sits next to me, blinking in time with the ringing in my ears. My body aches, every corner of the room seems to breathe, to move when I’m not looking.\n\nI can't close my eyes. I won't.\n\nBecause it's still here. I feel it.\n\nThe dark, the laugh, the echo.\n\nI fall into it again.\n\n\nI can’t breathe.\n\nI can't stop the ringing. I can't think. I can't even hear myself anymore, just the sound of the laughing, the screams, the moaning, and the ringing, the RINGING—it's all there is.\n\nI close my eyes, but it’s still there.\n\nI open my eyes, and—oh god—it’s still there.\n\nIt’s in my bones. It’s in the air. It’s everything.\n\nAnd then—I wake up.\n\nThe ringing is still there. I hear it.\n\nThe corners of the room—I can’t stop looking at them.\n\nThey’re shifting.

Growing up in Wilmington, he had seen the life the union longshoremen enjoyed and had envied them as he waved at their brand new trucks. He’d been jealous while he stood in their backyards drinking their beer and eating their carne asada. There had been a few that had even made enough to afford two families, one here, one over the border and here he was struggling to afford just one. Eventually his number came up and he jumped at the first opportunity he could get to get down on the waterfront. \n\nThis was going to change everything for his little family, maybe get him and his wife and baby out of their little section eight apartment under the shadow of The Don and into an actual house, allow them to welcome another baby without sweating how to afford it. Maybe one day he could even join the ILWU, be an inspiration to a local. He just needed to put in his time and keep his head down. \n\nIt was on the first night shift that he realized how difficult that might be. Immediately he realized that a few of the more audacious stevedores had been making extra money stealing from shipments and sending the goods over the border into Mexico. \n\n“Callarse la boca,” he was told, though he wasn’t about to say shit anyways. What was he going to do, rat? It wasn’t like he was a boy scout, though he liked to remain on the more lawful side of life. In his youth, like so many others that graduate from Banning, he had dabbled in the criminal underworld, but had learned quickly it was rougher than he’d like to play. \n\nHis wife had asked him where the new 75” TV he had brought home had come from, and scoffed at her husband when he said it was a “signing bonus”. She wasn’t stupid, her dad had said the same shit to her mother. In the past five years she’d seen him once up at Lompoc, and it was just to let him know he had a granddaughter he’d never get to see grow up. \n\n“Pendejo, if you leave me alone with this baby I’ll tell my dad to have you killed. ¿Quieres eso para tu hija? Huh? You want her to have the same issues with men I do?”\n\n“No empieces, it’s just a TV. I’m not selling drugs and I didn’t have a choice. They just gave it to me to keep my mouth shut.” Then he made the huge mistake of telling a Wilmas to calm down, and the reason for their argument kept him company on the couch.\n\nA few nights later, the same opening was available, so he took it. Of course, he wanted the work, but he also wanted to see what kind of stuff was coming in today. As he’d laid there watching football in 4k on a screen as big as his living room wall, Jose realized that he was on the cusp of a better life and looked forward to being able to sleep in a quiet house after working all night, instead of struggling through the din of Banda and screaming like he was now. It helped him decide to see where this rabbit hole led. He’d be careful of course; it scared him to think of being locked up, but it scared him more to end up the same way everyone else here did, paycheck to paycheck. Following the rules had got him nowhere, he was ready to see how bending them changed things. \n\nThat evening, he was surprised to see his buddy Pancho working with the crew he’d become familiar with a few nights ago. His presence was a bit of a comfort, he’d known him a long time, and he was his wife’s cousin. If he’d been jacking stuff from containers for this long, there was a better chance he would get away with it, too, since he was an idiot. \n\n“It’s cool man, we just keep it small and everyone looks the other way,” he’d said in Spanish. “Just keep it to yourself, eh.”\n\nSo he did. Once a week or so for months, Jose helped the crew steal from specific containers fed to him from dispatch, alerting them to loads with funky paperwork or from vendors with less than stellar track records. In his head he had painted the black mask of Zorro over his face, robbing from the corporate elite and giving to the poor, who happened to be his beautiful wife, and darling daughter. \n\nMarie-Carmen had stopped asking about the extra money all together, understanding the vicious cycle of poverty all too well. She figured she might as well enjoy the fringe benefits before meeting her destiny as a single-mom. At least things were better for Lupe, their daughter. \n\nPancho called Jose and let him know he had something lined up for that night, and to make sure he was ready. He didn’t care that Jose had just finished moving his family into their new rental, a two bedroom off Neptune, he needed his help. It sounded promising, if not a little small potatoes in comparison to the last few hauls. \n\n“It’s coming from Seattle to China. It’s a ghost, no paperwork. It’s like it never existed. I’m hoping there’s some Nike gear in there, or it could be some Starbucks shit. ¿Sepa? We’ll crack it open and see what it looks like.”\n\nAt 2am, a dog-tired Jose stood next to Pancho in front of container UUHH1177.\n\n“Damn, the taggers fucked this one up. Hola, diablito, que paso?”\n\nJose was unnerved by the massive demon face that had been spray painted on the door of the container. It gave him a bad feeling.\n\n“Come on man, maybe we shouldn’t mess with this one.”\n\n“What the fuck… we’re already here fucker, and we’ve only got an hour. Don’t be soft, culero.”\n\nBegrudgingly, Jose did as he was instructed and went about “unlocking” the door. It didn’t take much though, it seemed like it was eager to be opened. Pitch black in the cavernous metal box, their lights failed to pierce into the darkness more than a few feet. \n\nFrom over their shoulder, a whistle went up. Someone must have been coming, and before Jose could protest, Panchito had pushed him into the container, whispering “callate” as he shut the door. Locked in the blackness, Jose panicked silently. For what seemed like hours, he patiently waited for the door to open again, and tried to stave off the urge to beat on it from the inside. Surely, if he was found inside a container he would lose his job. This became the least of his worries, as dim lights illuminated the container behind him and he turned, revealing what looked like a weight room, with dumbbells, squat racks and bench press equipment lining the room. He was not alone in the container either, as tatted a half dozen monsters wearing prison blues went about working out. \n\n“What the fuck,” he said to himself in horror. There was no way this was real.\n\n“Oye, ven aqui,” one of the monsters commanded from the half darkness. “Come here! We been looking for you.”\n\nJose thought there was no fucking way he would be doing what he was told. From this distance he could see pustules erupting and foaming on the things rippling muscular arms. Undead muscles moved and peeked through the gashes in their flesh, revealing the intricacy of their design. The smell in the container was horrendous, a mixture of dead and rotten rats with the sweet stench of sweat, and added to the horror show that was developing in front of him. \n\n“Ahora,” it bellowed, and the festering group began to converge on him. He turned and beat on the door, screamed for his life, but there was no use. The mob was upon him at once. \n\nJose kicked and he screamed against their grasp, unsure how any of this was even possible. They moved him across the room without his permission and slammed him down onto one of the benches.\n\n“This is from Marie-Carmen, puta,” the monster said to him as his arms were pulled and twisted and jerked and he was stripped naked. A thick layer of pus covering his naked body as the monsters worked, making him sticky. As he continued to fight, the monsters began to bite his skin with fang-like teeth, leaving tiny sets of shark prints all over his body. Eventually, Jose could not fight any longer, the fear had taken over and all he could do was watch aghast. \n\n“She finally came to visit me, told me you were in here, so I pulled some strings and came to visit,” the man with dark red eyes oozed. The rotted face said to him: “I got to see little Lupe… her eyes look like yours. She was afraid too, afraid to see her abuelito, all locked up. She ain’t coming back. Not for either of us.”\n\nConfused, Jose tried to think, tried to quiet the fear that raged inside him. She? Had he said Marie-Carmen?\n\n“It’s for the better. A daughter shouldn’t see her papi locked up anyways. They’re both better off without us. A father will do anything for his daughter. How’s a dad to say no when she asks you to fuck up her good for nothing husband?”\n\nIt was then it clicked. The monsters bit and tore at the naked man as his attempts to escape resurged, the realization he was staring at his father in law, or a fucked up version of him at least, driving a new found horror and strength to flee. \n\n“Don’t struggle... Calmate,” the thing said as it grabbed a fifty pound dumbbell from the rack with ease. “Might as well take it like a man, she warned you.”\n\nWith that, the man raised the dumbbell up over his head and smashed it down on Jose’s leg, the breaking of his femur sending off a crack-like a gunshot. Fireworks of pain erupted in his eyes at the shock of the immense damage. \n\n“Porque no escuchas a tu esposa, huh” it asked. “She warned you this would happen. You left her alone to fend for herself. Hopefully some other pendejo takes up the slack and raises your kid.”\n\nThis time the weight smashed his right hand, creating a pulpy mess on the concrete floor. As Jose looked at what was left of it, he realized there was nothing to be saved. The weight pistoned up and down as the monster methodically shattered his arm, turning hardened carbon into tapioca pudding that oozed out of the splits in his flesh. \n\nAs the lights begin to fade, the pain truly too intense to comprehend, Jose asks his suegro if he will kill him.\n\n“Oh no yerno, I’m not going to kill you. That’s not how eternity works.”\n\n\nBy the time Jose finally regained consciousness his arm had already been amputated. Marie-Carmen was there to hold him as he wept, just glad to have her husband back. It had been hell ever since she’d gotten the call. She still didn’t fully understand how it had happened. She didn’t know what a top handler was or how it could have done this to her husband. No one told her why he had been naked when he’d arrived either, though she assumed the EMT’s had cut away his clothes when they’d finally found him. All she knew was a container being stacked had fallen, and Jose had barely escaped. Pancho had come to visit once when he’d been stabilized, but wouldn’t go into the room and hadn’t come back.\n\n\n\n\nIt took Jose a year to learn how to walk and use his new prosthetic. There was no word yet about his lawsuit for compensation after being injured on the job, things were different as a casual, but he held out hope. Maybe then Marie-Carmen would come back to him. He had never told her about what had actually happened that day, he knew the real story, it was seared into his memory, and it had eaten away at him. It had made him distant, it had caused him to take more and more pills. He had openly blamed the phantom pain of his arm for his addiction, because he could still feel the shots from the dumbbell, pulverizing his bones into dust. These feelings of uselessness further poisoned his mind, as he started to blame his wife for his torment, and made his inability to provide completely her fault. She had somehow caused this, brought on his nightmares with her threat. It was her dad that had smashed his dreams to bits, and he had taken it out on her. Now that he had driven her away he was destitute. He had nothing to live for.\n\nAs he sat, drunk on a bench at 2pm, he watched the railcars as they moved past him. Down the track, toward the waterfront they glided, until the face of the devil slowed to a stop in front of him. The same demonio that had welcomed him to hell smiling back at him, spray painted on the side of railcar UUH17 smug satisfaction on its face, as the door slid quietly open to an empty black cavern, and he was beckoned to go for another ride.

Not my blood—his. The walls of my room are closer now, weaving tighter around me. They breathe, pulsating with a rhythm not unlike a heartbeat. I’ve started to name them; each scarred wall has become a tired old friend. Flesh, it seems, is the only thing that understands my torment.\n\nI can't escape. I press my palms against the damp surface, feeling it shift beneath my touch. The walls writhe like a living entity, distorting the shadows around me in grotesque forms. Sometimes I can swear I hear whispering within them, words slithering through the sinew and skin. They taunt me, beckoning me to listen.\n\n\"It's just a hallucination,\" I tell myself. \"Just the madness creeping in.\" It’s what they said, after the lights flickered, after the first crack appeared in the corner of my room. I thought they were wrong. I never needed help. I never needed them at all. Their reassurance was drowned out by the pounding of my heart, the whispering cries, the ever-tightening walls.\n\n“Don’t listen to him.” Those words curl around my thoughts like smoke, repeating endlessly. The voice is deep and seductive, sinking into my mind like an insect burrowing under my skin. I can almost see him—a figure wrapped in shadows, his face obscured, but his eyes burn with an intelligence that terrifies me. In those moments of clarity, I understand with bone-chilling certainty that he is not real, but just a figment of this wretched confinement.\n\nYet another night passes, and my hunger grows. The only sustenance is the flickering memories from outside these walls. I remember laughter, the warmth of the sun on my skin, and the taste of food—real food, not the suffocating flesh that surrounds me now. They told me it was wrong to want those things, that the outside was nothing but a deceptive facade for pleasure and pain. They told me hell was escaping.\n\nBut what kind of hell tortures you from the inside? What kind of punishment pulls you into the marrow of despair with no hope of redemption? I can feel it; I am drawn toward something at the center of this mass, something dark and infinite, waiting to unleash its fury on a world that has long forgotten me. Its laughter echoes louder, reverberating off the walls like the cries of the damned.\n\nI am no longer the man I once was. Time does not exist here; it stretches and contracts, causing my sanity to bleed into the spaces between. Days? Weeks? Months? Time doesn’t matter. I can feel the walls thinning now, a pulsating rhythm that matches the frenetic beat of my heart. Every movement they make closes in on me more and more. I see it in the walls—the faint outlines of faces trapped in agony, begging me to join them.\n\n\"Help us…\" they murmur.\n\nBut the shadows—they are pulling me away from them, deeper into the darkness where the lines blur. They beg me not to listen, and still, I hear the hapless cries of despair. I try grappling with the last remnants of my sanity, suppressing the primal urge to escape by tearing through the flesh.\n\nYet something inside me knows that the moment I break free from this suffocating horror, I will forfeit my soul. Am I a fool to resist? Am I just clinging to fragments of what used to be?\n\nI can't tell anymore. I'm losing myself to the flesh-walls, becoming a part of their hell. I'm merging with their stories, their tragedies, but that figure in the shadows is still there, whispering.\n\n“Don’t listen to him.”\n\nBut what does he know? In this haunting cathedral of flesh, where the walls have ears and the shadows have eyes, who is there left to hear my truth?\n\nI close my eyes and press my forehead to the flesh, seeking solace and yet finding despair. Is it wrong to ache for the outside world, to long for something other than confinement?\n\nI’m trapped in a prison of my own creation, with no way out but through the walls’ suffocating embrace. I feel it tightening, the darkness looming closer, the screams within growing louder.\n\nSoon, there will be no more me. Only the flesh—and the echoing dark that waits just beyond. And when it comes, when it finally breaks free, the world will tremble at its feet.\n\nI scream as reality blurs, engulfed by shadows.\n\n“Don’t listen to him…”\n\nThen everything fades to black, drowning out my thoughts and silencing my screams.\n\nDo you hear it? It’s coming. It’s coming for you.\n\nDon’t listen to him..."},"123":{"title":"Bad Habits For Sale","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ft1m22\/bad_habits_for_sale\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"NagolSook","selftext":"There’s a shop on a street I barely remember walking down, though I must have passed it a thousand times. It’s the kind of place you don’t think twice about, blending into the dull backdrop of the city. No windows, no displays, just a simple sign hanging from a rusted chain: “Bad Habits for Sale.”\n\nI couldn’t tell you why I went inside that first time. Curiosity? Boredom? Maybe it was exhaustion, the kind that sinks in deep when the days start blending together. Either way, I found myself there again today, the door creaking as it closed behind me.\n\nThe shop was dim, lit by a single flickering bulb that cast long shadows over the shelves. The shelves themselves were lined with jars—simple, unadorned, but each one labeled in the same shaky handwriting: *Impatience*, *Procrastination*, *Overindulgence*, *Self-Pity.* They stretched on endlessly, it seemed, row after row of familiar vices.\n\nI moved through the aisles slowly, like I always did, not quite sure what I was looking for but knowing I’d find it. The air was thick, stale, and the soft hum that always filled the room was louder than I remembered. Maybe it was just my head, tired and clouded, but the sound seemed to follow me, clinging to my thoughts like a low, constant buzz.\n\nAt the counter sat the shopkeeper, just as unremarkable as the shop itself. Middle-aged, balding, with a cigarette hanging loosely from his lips. He barely looked up when I entered, his eyes glued to the small TV beside him, where static flickered over an old infomercial.\n\nI wandered through the aisles, picking up a jar labeled *Distraction*. The glass was cool in my hand, and the contents inside swirled slowly, like smoke trapped in a bottle. I turned it over, reading the label again, feeling a strange sense of familiarity, like I’d held it before. I probably had.\n\n“How much for this one?” I asked, more out of habit than anything else.\n\nThe shopkeeper didn’t even glance up from the TV. “You’ve already paid,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “You’ve been paying for years.”\n\nThe words hit me harder than they should have. Already paid. Of course I had. I’d been paying for it, paying for all of it, long before I ever stepped foot in this place. The late nights spent doing nothing, the endless scrolling through screens, the excuses piled up so high I could barely see over them. I had paid with every wasted moment, every opportunity I let slip by, every hour I spent convincing myself there was always more time.\n\nI set the jar back on the shelf, my hands suddenly feeling too heavy. I could hear the hum again, louder now, vibrating through my skull. I glanced at the other jars—*Regret*, *Nostalgia*, *Apathy*. They all seemed to shimmer under the dim light, beckoning me to pick them up, to hold them, to remember how easily they fit in my hands.\n\n“You don’t need anything new,” the shopkeeper said, as if reading my thoughts. “You’ve got enough already.”\n\nI looked at him, finally. He wasn’t watching the TV anymore. His eyes were on me now, tired and knowing. I wanted to argue, to say that this time was different, that I was just browsing, just passing through. But the words felt hollow before they even reached my lips.\n\nI didn’t need anything new. He was right. I’d been carrying these habits with me for so long, they were part of me. I’d been paying for them in minutes, in years, in pieces of myself I couldn’t even remember losing. And now, here I was, back again, staring at the same shelves, the same jars, like it was all some kind of ritual.\n\nI walked to the end of the aisle, where a jar labeled *Disillusionment* sat on the lowest shelf. I knelt down, hesitating before picking it up. The glass was darker than the others, almost opaque, and the contents inside didn’t swirl or shift. They just sat there, heavy and still. I knew this one too. It had been with me for years, lingering in the background, filling the spaces between ambition and reality.\n\n“You’ve already paid for that one too,” the shopkeeper said softly.\n\nI stood up, clutching the jar in my hands, staring at the label, the familiar weight pressing into my palms. I had paid for it, over and over again. With every moment of doubt, every dream I let rot in the back of my mind, every time I told myself that nothing mattered anyway.\n\nIt was a revelation, but not the kind that came with relief. It was the kind that settled in deep, with a slow, creeping dread. I had been paying for these habits with time I couldn’t get back. And I would keep paying, day after day, year after year, until I was nothing more than a collection of these jars, gathering dust on a shelf.\n\nI didn’t ask for a price again. I didn’t need to. I placed the jar back on the shelf, feeling its weight leave my hands but not my chest.\n\n“You’ll be back,” the shopkeeper said, lighting another cigarette, his eyes drifting back to the screen.\n\nI nodded, not because I agreed, but because I knew it was true.\n\nI walked out of the shop and into the gray street, the hum still buzzing in my ears. The door creaked shut behind me, and the sign above swayed gently in the wind. “Bad Habits for Sale,” it read, as if it had always been there, as if it always would be.\n\nAnd I kept walking, knowing I’d be back.\n\nI always came back.\n"},"124":{"title":"the oldblood","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ft3aqe\/the_oldblood\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"oldblood113","selftext":"[https:\/\/imgur.com\/bxOjgrE](https:\/\/imgur.com\/bxOjgrE)\n\nThis is  the beginning\n\nIn every darkness lies an unseen secret.

I couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling that hung in the air, like the basement itself had absorbed that eerie encounter. I replayed the event in my mind over and over, questioning every decision I made. What would have happened if I had flipped the switch? How could that voice have sounded so much like my dad’s, yet felt so disturbingly wrong?\n\nMom was just as shaken. We barely spoke about it afterward, but every now and then, I’d catch her glancing nervously at the basement door, as though it held a secret neither of us wanted to face.\n\nWeeks passed, and I tried to move on, to shove the memory into the back of my mind. I went back to my usual routine—staying up late, finding comfort in my books and the quiet stillness of the house. But every so often, I’d hear strange sounds: faint whispers, the soft creaking of the basement stairs, or a distant hum, like something mechanical was trying to come to life down there.\n\nOne night, as I was curled up with a novel, I heard it again—Dad’s voice. But this time, it wasn’t coming from the phone. It was coming from the basement.\n\n\"Sarah... come down here.\"\n\nMy heart stopped, dread washing over me. I knew better now, but the voice was so clear, so unmistakably my father’s. Yet, I knew it couldn’t be him—he was still at work, and Mom had left for her shift just hours earlier.\n\nSlowly, I stood up and made my way toward the basement door, my hands trembling. The voice called out again, more insistent this time.\n\n\"Sarah, please. I need you to come down here.\"\n\nI reached for the doorknob, my fingers just barely brushing it before I pulled back. Something told me to stop. I grabbed my phone instead, my fingers fumbling as I dialed my dad’s number. It rang once, twice, and then—\n\n\"Hey, sweetheart, what’s up?\" Dad’s voice came through, calm and cheerful.\n\n\"Dad,\" I whispered, my voice shaking, \"Are you... at work right now?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course. Why? Is everything okay?\"\n\nI felt ice rush through my veins. My eyes flicked to the basement door, where the voice had gone silent. Something was waiting for me down there, something that knew how to sound exactly like my father.\n\n\"Yeah, everything’s fine,\" I lied, trying to keep my voice steady. \"I'll talk to you later, okay?\"\n\nI hung up and backed away, refusing to look away from the door. It felt like it might burst open at any moment.\n\nThat night, I made up my mind. Mom and I couldn’t stay in the house any longer. Whatever had taken root here wasn’t natural. It was watching, waiting. The next day, we packed our things and left without looking back.\n\nEven years later, I still sometimes wake up in the dead of night, my heart racing, as if I can hear that voice again, calling from the basement. \"Sarah... come down here.\""},"127":{"title":"George's poop adventures","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ft8256\/georges_poop_adventures\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Frozenmatchoman","selftext":"\n\nwell anyways the first time he tried it he was in the bathroom. he was curious so he took a log and ate a bit off the tip like a banana in a lewd way. he also liked the bile taste. he also apparently likes to rub it all over him as well. like mashin poop into his hair.  he also had this one time where he mixed his diarrhea with his urine and oats to mkae it thicker and drank it like a smoothie( saw him do it) and he often keeps these concoctions in the fridge but he likes to heat it up in the microwave because he likes it warm rather then cold. he also likes it more when he has ALOT of that poop jelly. he likes so slurp it up along with drinking the poop smothie. sometimes he will gurgle it then spit it back into the bag then drink it then spit it back. he will do this many times ( like 20+ until its silky enough) like swishing it through his teeth and stuff. then he will swallow it. but over everything the poop snot rains supreme. he loves it when its snotty because it has such a good taste. the hard poop has a mud like consistency but the SNOT is perfect for him. anyways ill take it to dms now thx."},"128":{"title":"I am being forced to marry myself ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsvvsc\/i_am_being_forced_to_marry_myself\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"My parents are forcing me to get married to myself but I don't want to get married to myself.

I am really freaking out right now and I don't know what to do as I am against this. I don't want to even get married in general but my parents aren't even listening. Another reason that I don't want to get married to myself is because I am a terrible person. \n\nI do not want to get married to a terrible person like myself. My parents said that I have a year to really turn myself into a good person and change my ways, so when I marry myself, I will be an easier person to be married with. I don't really want to change and I hate this so much and I hate my parents for doing this. If I get married to myself right now it will be the worst marriage imaginable. I have seriously wrong things about me and I do not want to be married to that. \n\nI tried running away but everytime I run away, when I look back I see my body. Then I realised that because I am marrying myself, running away will be running away from myself. So when ever I runaway, it's like I turn into a ghost and wherever I go my body is there right next to me. So running away is out of the option. Nobody should force anybody to marry one's self and especially if they are a bad person. I am a horrid person and I have seriously fucked up things, so getting married to myself is a danger to myself. \n\nMy parent said that I had a year to change and because I saw no way out, I decided to change myself. I changed my whole life around and I made amendments to all those that I had hurt. All of the people I had accidentally murdered due to my reckless actions had visited me as a ghost. They forgave me and it was a heart warming moment. I changes so much that people didn't recognise me and the person that I had turned into was a person I would marry. I had accepted that I was being forced to marry myself. \n\nThen when I thought the day was coming that i was going to get forced to marry myself, my parents told me that they aren't going to force me to marry myself.

Within its hallowed halls, where the scent of ancient parchment lingered and the soft rustle of turning pages filled the air, dwelled a librarian named Alice Hawthorne, keeper of the Archive of Shadows.\n\n Alice was a solitary figure, her pale features illuminated by the soft glow of the library's lamps as she moved silently among the towering shelves. She had always been drawn to the mysteries that lurked within the pages of forgotten tomes, seeking solace in the embrace of knowledge that spanned centuries.\n\n But as she delved deeper into the depths of the Archive of Shadows, Alice uncovered a truth more terrifying than anything she had ever imagined. Bound within the pages of an ancient grimoire, she discovered an incantation that promised to unlock the secrets of the universe itself.\n\nDriven by a hunger for understanding that bordered on obsession, Alice whispered the words of power, her voice echoing through the silent halls of the library. And in that moment, she unleashed a force beyond her comprehension, one that would consume her very soul.\n\n As the incantation took hold, the shadows within the library began to stir, coalescing into twisted forms that slithered and writhed in the darkness. Whispers filled the air, their words laced with malice as they beckoned Alice deeper into the abyss.\n\n But try as she might, Alice could not break free from the grasp of the darkness that enveloped her. It whispered promises of forbidden knowledge and untold power, twisting her thoughts and warping her perceptions until she no longer knew friend from foe.\n\n And then, one by one, the patrons of the library began to vanish, their cries for help swallowed by the ever-growing darkness. Those who dared to venture into the Archive of Shadows never returned, their fate sealed by the malevolent force that now held sway over the library's halls.\n\n As the city plunged into chaos and despair, whispers of the librarian who had unleashed a darkness beyond reckoning spread like wildfire. But amidst the terror and uncertainty, one question remained unanswered: What had become of Alice Hawthorne, and could anyone hope to stand against the shadows that now roamed free within the Central Library\n\n\\*\\*\\* Feel free to send me your story, I will make a creepy video and upload it to my Youtub.e Channel\\*\\*\\*"},"131":{"title":"Someone or something keeps on calling me at 3 in the morning!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsoozj\/someone_or_something_keeps_on_calling_me_at_3_in\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"NorahjjiYT","selftext":"Ring ring ring ring! \n\nThere it was, the sound of my phone going off at 3 in the damn morning! \n\n“What the hell!” I thought to myself in confusion and overall fear. \n\nPicking it up I said down the line, “Who is this, what do you want, and why the hell are you calling so damn early?” \n\n*no response*\n\n“Do you not hear me!

This time, it’s different. \n\nHe’s deep into something called Humm Kill. A band…. lol \n\nHe’s always had a thing for digging into obscure stuff, but lately… it’s annoying lol\n\nHowever, I heard Humm Kill on the radio today. Good stuff. \n\nApril 15, 2007\nSorry, It’s Been a While… again lol\n\nHey guys, sorry for the radio silence. \n\nWe were supposed to be filming yesterday, more content for the show. \n\nJoe’s… well, he been complaining of ear issues… Hearing an unusual sound or ringing and it’s all he talks about.\n\nHe’s completely checked out. Canceled plans, won’t answer calls, and when I went to his place, he barely looked up from his computer. I tried talking to him, but it’s like he’s not even there.\n\nApril 20, 2007\nJoe’s Ghosting Me…\n\nIt’s been five days now… still nothing from Joe. He’s completely gone off the grid… no calls, no texts, no emails. I even went by his place again, but I didn’t knock. There was just… this feeling in my gut that told me not to.\n\nMaybe I’m overreacting. But something’s off. I can feel it.\n\nI’ll try again tomorrow. Just wanted to put this out there, mostly for myself. Maybe I’m imagining things.\n\nHeard Humm Kill’s song Brain Dump Stew today or is it “Stü”? Who knows… lol \n\nIt’s good though. No Strokes, but catchy. \n\nApril 25, 2007\nI Heard It…\n\nI wasn’t going to mention this, but I heard the sound Joe was talking about. It’s a hum. I hear it. \n\nIt isn’t loud, barely a whisper, but it’s there. It came out of nowhere while I was driving home. I thought it was static from the my radio, but it wasn’t. The hum just hung in the air, like it was waiting for me to notice it. It was still there. \n\nJoe was talking about it. I thought he was making it up… lol\n\nBut now… I’m not so sure. I’m trying to stay grounded, but every time I think about it, the hum gets louder. Do you hear it? Is it just Dunbrook, Illinois?\n\nI don’t know if it’s in my head or if something’s happening. Either way, I’m can’t fall sleep.\n\nMay 1, 2007\nThe Hum Won’t Stop\n\nIt’s getting worse. I can hear the hum all the time now. It’s like a constant pressure in the back of my mind, and I can’t shut it off. It’s driving me crazy.\n\nI don’t know how Joe’s been handling this for so long. Some kind of frequency. I didn’t believe him at first, but now… I don’t know what to believe.\n\nI haven’t talked to Joe in a while. I’m scared to go back to his place. I don’t know what I’ll find.\n\nMay 10, 2007\nCan’t Sleep\n\nI’ve been up for days now. The hum… it’s not just a sound anymore. It’s in my head. I can’t get away from it. Every time I close my eyes, it’s there, humming away, like it’s pulling at something inside me. Speaking to me. \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about what’s happened over the past few weeks. I’m not even sure I remember it all clearly anymore. It’s like there’s a fog in my brain, and the more I try to think about it, the worse it gets.\n\nThe hum… it’s making me think none of it matters. Maybe it doesn’t.\n\nI don’t know who I am anymore.\n\nMay 15, 2007\nI Saw Him…\n\nI went back to Joe’s today. I couldn’t help myself.\n\nHe answered the door this time. But it wasn’t him. Not really. He looked hollow… gaunt, like he hadn’t slept in days. His eyes were… wrong. I don’t know how to explain it. I tried to talk to him, but he just stared at me, like he was looking through me. He wouldn’t turn the music off for us to have a conversation. \n\nI could hear the hum, louder than ever. It wasn’t just in my head anymore. It was all around us. I don’t even know if I said goodbye when I left.\n\nI can’t do this anymore.\n\nMay 23, 2007\nIt’s Too Late\n\nThere’s no way out of this. I know that now. The hum… it’s everywhere. Humm Kill, It’s inside me, and I can’t escape it.\n\nI’ve done things. Horrible things. I can’t even bring myself to write them down. But I know I can’t take them back. Not now.\n\nIt’s too late.

It was some folklore story about the woods near where I live. (I won't be giving the location for safety reasons) Some people believe whole-heartedly in the Tree Lurker, while others thought it was just some urban legend.\n\nI have my own business, I take calls from people wanting me to explore their woods, saying that they heard something strange. Usually I don't find anything and just tell them it was an animal. Sometimes I see a moose or a grizzly bear, but not much. \n\nThis morning I got a call where the person on the other end told me they thought they saw the Tree Lurker. I am honestly kinda surprised I haven't gotten one of these calls before.\n\nWell, while I lay here I'll tell you about the Tree Lurker. The creature has arms that look like branches and a face made out of a piece of bark with a giant mouth filled with thorny teeth. There are many stories of the Tree Lurker, but here are the 4 everyone can seem to agree on.\n\nA Father: A man was just exploring the woods when he heard what sounded like a bird, he ignored them, but the noises kept on happening and he kept on getting more tired. Eventually he fell asleep on the hard bumpy floor by a lake. While he is asleep The Tree lurker would kill and eat him. When the body was found by police, all of his organs were removed, but there was not a single scratch on the outside of his body and all of his flesh and bones were intact.\n\nA Son: The man aboves son was searching the woods for this creature. He didn't hear any bird noises, but he could hear rustling and strange cries. He didn't fall asleep, but instead found the creature by the same lake that his dad died by. The Son pulled out his shotgun to shoot the creature, but was stopped when one of the creature's vines shot out and grabbed the gun. Unlike his father this man was found with a huge scratch down his stomach with blood pouring out of it.\n\nA Grandma: A Grandma was out in a field picking strawberries when she heard the bird noises. “ ahh what a calming noise” she said right before she collapsed into a bush. Her body was found just as the first man, but with strawberries filling her mouth.\n\nA Hunter: A man was out hunting in the woods when his gun ran out of ammo. On his way back to his car, he started hearing the noises and collapsed against a tree. His organs were also taken out without a scratch on his body. But he had his gun stuffed into his mouth.\n\nSo he seemed to use a strange bird call to send his victims into a trance that made them pass out before he would eventually kill them. Anyways, those are the main 4 stories. I would be willing to tell you the rest of them, but I'm starting to hear some strange bird noises… and I'm trying not to fall asleep."},"138":{"title":"Weird indecent ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsl124\/weird_indecent\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"ILLdoggystyleYou","selftext":"So me, my parents and my sister, live on a farmland in Alabama and not too big and have 1 acer of land \nBut one day, I went down to our pin where we kept our goats, and I find a girl goat dead \nDidn't think much of it after I put her in the field, but then not 2 days later, a boy goat and a boy lamb died when they were fine the other day \nAnd just yesterday, one of our goats was in a barrel \n(Not a big one)\nHer hind legs were in, but the rest of her was out \nNothing was wrong with her the day earlier \nAnd she was still alive she was foaming of the mouth\nSo idk know what's going on\n"},"139":{"title":"Hi guys.

You've been coding all night.\"\n\n\n\nI rubbed my eyes, feeling the grit of sleep deprivation. \"Yeah, you're right,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the uneasy feeling. \"It's just these horror games I've been working on.\" The screen flickered for a split second, and my heart skipped a beat. \"But seriously, it's like it knows what I'm going to type before I do.\"\n\n\n\nIgnoring Tim's snort, I turned back to my laptop. The cursor blinked at me like a malicious eye, daring me to continue. My fingers hovered over the keys, and as I began to type again, a strange warmth spread through my fingertips, as if the keyboard was alive and responding to my touch. The letters on the screen danced in a macabre waltz, forming words and sentences that weren't my own. My skin crawled as if the air around me had grown thick with static electricity.\n\n\n\nThe words grew bolder, more sinister with every keystroke. The screen began to distort, stretching and contorting the light in the room like a funhouse mirror. The shadows grew longer, reaching out like tendrils of darkness, wrapping themselves around my desk chair and the edges of the room. A chill crept up my spine, and the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. The room grew cold, the warmth of my laptop the only heat source in an arctic void.\n\n\n\nI tried to pull my hands away, but they remained glued to the keyboard, my fingers moving in a dance dictated by some unseen force. My heart hammered in my chest, and I could feel the pulse in my wrists syncing with the rhythm of the typing. The room spun around me, the only constant the sickly grin of the screen reflecting in the black pools of my pupils. The words grew darker, speaking of secrets I had long ago buried, of fears I had thought were forgotten. It was as if the virus had invaded my mind, plucking out the deepest, most hidden parts of me and laying them bare for its perusal.\n\n\n\nTim's laughter grew distant, muffled by the sound of my own ragged breathing and the incessant clacking of keys. I had to get out of this, had to stop the monster that had taken over my laptop. With a Herculean effort, I managed to tear my gaze from the screen and look around the room. The shadows had grown teeth, and they snarled at me from every corner, daring me to move. My breath came in short, sharp gasps, each one feeling like it could be my last.\n\n\n\nA sudden jolt of pain shot through my fingers, and the typing stopped. The room grew eerily still, the silence pressing down on me like a heavy blanket. My eyes snapped back to the screen, expecting to see the words continue to form without my help, but instead, the monitor went dark. The only light in the room was the faint glow of the power button, like a single, malevolent eye watching me.\n\n\n\nWith trembling hands, I reached out to touch the cold, unresponsive keys, but as my skin made contact, the laptop sprang to life, the screen flickering back on with a vengeance. A message scrawled across the display in a font that looked like it had been ripped from a child's nightmare: \"I've been waiting for you.\" The words pulsed with a sickly green light, as if alive.\n\n\n\nMy stomach lurched, and I tried to stand, only to realize that my legs had gone numb. I glanced down to find them tangled in a mess of cables, the same tendrils of shadow that had been snaking around my chair now coiled around my ankles. Panic set in as I struggled to free myself, the cold metal digging into my flesh like icy fangs. The message on the screen grew larger, the words pressing closer and closer to the edge until they spilled over, pooling onto the desk like a vile ooze.\n\n\n\nWith a surge of adrenaline, I ripped the cables from my legs, sending the chair toppling backward. I crashed to the floor, the wind knocked out of me. The screen flickered again, the message changing to a question, \"Are you sure you want to leave?\" It was as if the very fabric of reality was being manipulated by this digital demon. I managed a choking gasp, scrambling away from the desk. The shadows retreated, but the cold lingered, seeping into my bones like an icy fog.\n\n\n\nOn unsteady legs, I stumbled to my bed and collapsed onto the mattress, my heart racing. The room felt claustrophobic, the walls closing in with every beat. I tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep and too much caffeine. But as I glanced back at the desk, the laptop monitor was still on, the question hanging in the air like a taunt.\n\n\n\nTim's voice broke the silence, \"You okay, dude?\"\n\n\n\nMy eyes shot open, and there he was, standing over me, his face a mask of horror. I looked down to my hands, expecting to find them resting on the mattress, but instead, they were suspended in mid-air, hovering over an invisible keyboard. The sensation was surreal, a blend of cold and pressure, as if I was typing on a keyboard made of mist. The realization hit me like a sledgehammer: the nightmare had bled into reality.\n\n\n\nI scrambled off the bed, my legs wobbly and uncooperative. \"We have to get rid of it,\" I croaked, the fear thick in my voice. \"Now.\"\n\n\n\nTim stared at me, his eyes wide with shock. \"Okay, okay,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"Let's just toss it out the window.\"\n\n\n\nWe stumbled over to the desk, and with a grunt of effort, I lifted the laptop and hurled it through the open window. It arced through the moonlit night, a silent scream of circuits and plastic. We heard the distant thud as it hit the ground, and for a moment, I felt a rush of relief. But then, as we both looked back at the empty space where the computer had been, the room grew colder. The shadows had retreated, but they weren't gone. They were just waiting, watching."},"142":{"title":"CIA The No Sleep Experiment ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fskap6\/cia_the_no_sleep_experiment\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"313deezy","selftext":"The room was silent except for the hum of machines and the distant beeping of heart monitors. I had been awake for 72 hours straight, and yet, I felt strangely lucid—almost as if my senses had sharpened rather than dulled. This was not natural. No amount of caffeine or adrenaline should be able to keep a person this alert after so many hours of forced consciousness. But this wasn’t a normal situation, either.\n\nI had volunteered for the experiment, or at least that’s what they made me believe. A patriot, they called me. I had undergone all the necessary briefings, signed the waivers with words I barely comprehended, and let them inject me with whatever cocktail of experimental drugs and nanites they had cooked up in their hidden labs. The No Sleep Program, they called it. In theory, it was meant to enhance human endurance, eliminate the need for sleep altogether. A soldier who didn’t need rest could outperform any opponent. Imagine the advantage, they said.\n\nBut they didn’t tell us what would happen when the mind fought back.\n\nIt started on the fifth day. Or maybe it was the sixth? Time was slippery in that place. The dim lighting never changed, keeping us in a constant twilight. I was sitting in the corner of the room, staring at the floor, when I noticed something shift in the periphery of my vision. At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, a flicker of something passing through my field of view. But when I turned to look, I saw it again—a shadow, moving along the edge of the wall.\n\nMy heart began to race. My brain was screaming at me to blink, to reset, but I couldn’t. The shadow didn’t disappear; it grew. Slowly, it formed into something more distinct. A figure. Tall, humanoid, but stretched, like it had been distorted by some unseen force. It didn’t have a face. Or maybe it did, but my mind wouldn’t allow me to comprehend it.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, but the afterimage of that thing remained burned into my mind’s eye. When I opened them again, the figure was standing at the foot of my bed. Watching. No... not watching. It was waiting. For what, I had no idea.\n\nI tried to scream, but my throat was dry, my voice strangled. I had to remind myself that none of this was real. It was just my mind reacting to the lack of sleep. I had read about hallucinations—seen the reports, even watched the grainy black-and-white surveillance footage of past participants flailing at invisible enemies or sobbing uncontrollably at figments of their imagination.\n\nBut this felt different. Too real. Too vivid.\n\nIn the reflection of the one-way mirror, I saw the scientists watching me. They were calm, dispassionate, their eyes fixed on the monitors that recorded every biological metric, but I knew they could see what I saw. I knew they could see the shadow figure just as clearly as I did. Yet, they did nothing. No comforting words, no sedatives. Just cold, clinical observation.\n\nI began to wonder if they had created that thing. Maybe it wasn’t just a side effect. Maybe it was part of the program. A test. What happens when you push a person beyond the limits of human endurance? What does the mind conjure when it is deprived of its natural rest cycles?\n\nThe hallucinations grew worse with every passing hour. I started to hear things too—whispers, faint at first, but growing louder. Voices from people I had never met, and some I swore I recognized. One was my mother’s voice, though she had died years ago. Another was the voice of my old squad leader, dead from an IED in Iraq. They called to me, urged me to let go, to succumb to the sweet embrace of unconsciousness.\n\nBut the rules were clear: No sleep. No escape.\n\nOn the tenth day, reality fractured.\n\nI was no longer in the sterile confines of the CIA lab. I was in a war zone. Dust, blood, and fire filled the air. The ground beneath me shook with the force of explosions, and distant screams echoed through the night. I ran, but my legs felt like lead. I had to get out, had to escape the chaos. I looked around for my comrades, but all I saw were those shadow figures, moving in the haze like specters of death.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it had started, it was gone. I was back in the lab, my heart hammering in my chest, sweat pouring down my face. My body trembled, every muscle taut with fear and confusion. But I was alone. The figures, the war, the voices—they were all gone. The room was silent again.\n\nI didn’t know how much more of this I could take. I didn’t even know if I was still me anymore. The boundaries of self were blurring, my thoughts splintering into a thousand fragments. I tried to remember why I had volunteered for this—why I had agreed to put myself through this torture. For my country? For science? For the promise of a future where sleep was no longer a necessity?\n\nNo. I couldn’t even remember my own motivations anymore. The only thing I knew for certain was that I was trapped. Trapped in a nightmare that I couldn’t wake up from, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nAnd then, one night—or was it day?—I heard a voice that was different from the others. Clearer. Realer.\n\n“You can stop this,” it said. “You just have to let go.”\n\nI looked around, trying to locate the source of the voice. It was a man’s voice. Calm, almost soothing. But there was something about it that made my skin crawl. It didn’t belong here.\n\n“Who are you?” I whispered, though I wasn’t sure my voice even made a sound.\n\nThe voice chuckled, and I felt a cold breeze brush against the back of my neck. “I am the one watching,” it said. “I’ve always been watching. You were never supposed to last this long.”\n\n“What are you?” I asked, my heart pounding.\n\n“I’m your mind,” the voice replied. “The part of you they tried to suppress. But you see, even they can’t control what you really are.”\n\nAnd then I realized. The figures, the voices, the hallucinations—they weren’t just side effects. They were manifestations of something deeper. The experiment hadn’t just kept me awake; it had awakened something within me. Something dark. Something that had been waiting in the shadows of my mind all along.\n\nThe voice grew quieter, as if retreating back into the recesses of my consciousness, but not before it left me with one final thought.\n\n“Sleep,” it whispered, “is for the weak.”\n\nAnd then, there was nothing but silence.\n\nBut I knew that even if I somehow made it out of that lab, I would never be free of the thing they had awakened. It would follow me. Forever."},"143":{"title":"I think I am an atheist, I'm not sure?

By all means, help a fellow redditor out please!\n\n========================\n\n**TDLR at Bottom**\n\n==================\n\n\n*Description of Encounter:*\n\n  I caught this encounter on video in July 17th of this year - 2024.\n\n  I'm super experienced with extreme rugged camping. I avoid cold at all costs - not my cup o' tea but heat and rugged; I love.\n\n  I ride out on quad usually to remote locations.. Often cowboy camp.. Literally just facedown in the mud\/dirt\/sand, you name it ect... occasionally. \n\n  This year I ventured out. Found an off grid site that had an old Iron trash can as a fire pit and a Picnic table. \n\n  Boonie of nowhere.\n\n  About 10 minutes go by after I shut the quad off, I begun hearing these odd screaming sounds with reverb off in the far South-East distance of my position - moving North-East.\n\n  Didn't think much of it at all, firstly.. Thought some fired up riders passing through or something as quite common.. It being a Tuesday though, barely seen anybody out there the entire week until friday.\n\n  Finally noticed it getting closer and closer to me.\n\n  That's when I started rolling film..\n\n  It sounded like a male adult primally screaming in dying agony, some type of creature, and either an adult female screaming or small child screaming - All at once with reverb. The way the sound was bouncing through the trees was downright bizarre. No echo I've ever really heard in my life in the woods or... anywhere really..\n\n  It all suddenly phased into sounding like it was completely surrounding all around me at this point a few yards beyond the tree line. (Imagine hearing screaming in a specific direction and it suddenly clicks to sounding like it's all around you.)\n\n  It all suddenly halts.\n\n  I then hear semi-unintelligible words screaming from the male with reverb, in the north-west of my location.\n\n  The female \/ little child screams back from same location.\n\n  More word screaming commenced as some other rider came up chasing after it for whatever reason..\n\nI do NOT scare easily AT ALL, but I then grabbed protection i.e. high pitched sound in video.. Not out of fear but just so I knew I was safe im general...\n\n  I halted the guy on the bike and he said he had no idea what it was, but was following it to try and see what it was. - No clue how he even came across whatever this was...\n\n  It begun moving quickly off in the distance again and the rider took off immediately there after.\n\n  No clue wth it was personally or why guy was even trying see what it was either...\n\n  Never heard anything like this in my entire life of camping\/riding and I have completed hundreds of excursions at this point..\n\n  Was never spooked for some odd reason either, through the entire experience... Looking back, I sure as shite should have been no doubt at all. But for some reason... I just simply listened and recorded as quietly as I could..\n\n  I've listened to the recording a million times over and I still have zero clue.... At all....\n\n  The state I was in is known for Wolfman and other cryptids if one believes in folklore as such I suppose.. I've never encountered any creatures eyes-on in my life so I can't say personally if they exist or not. I don't dismiss anything as it can't be totally ruled out though. Life is mysterious in general so I stay open minded.\n\n  I simply have absolute zero clue what I encountered that night and it's still driving me nuts..\n\n  Anyone out there think this is just drunkards... or something..... Unknown?\n\n  Just for reference because this has been stated in another post - No mountain lions exist in the state I was in.... The possibility of mountain lions being rouge either can't be ruled out obviously... I do believe Bobcats may roam about but I'm not fully certain... But either way, I don't think they speak English lol or at least what resembled English.. or language... to me in the experience and video...\n\n  I even recently returned and took a trip back to the same exact location.. Passed out in the dirt\/sand for a few and awoken around 11:20PM.. Didn't feel like camping there a full night again because I wanted to explore new locations to camp so I ended up taking off... \n\n  Which I am in the process of making another video of that trip but it's nothing spectacular by any means.. No occurrences took place at all that trip. Barely even any wild life for the three days I was out there...\n\n  Anyone out there want to take a stabb at what this could be??? ...Because I'm clueless...\n\n  Like I said, I don't scare easily at all. In the moment, I even remember at one point thinking, \"should I scream back?\"... Just to see wth would happen.. But common sense kept me from it since I had no clue what I was dealing with.. Still 50\/50 kicking myself for lol\n\n  Wasn't spooked at all in the moment but now.. Every. Single. Time... I listen to these sounds, my hair stands like static..\n\n=========================\n\nI have a short version of this video but I would provide the long version (if I could....) due to it being so much more clear regarding sound.. Because I overlaid a video ontop, just for a good intro in the beginning...... and there's other proof of possibilities I also captured that's included in the video, so they may be completely ruled out..\n\n  I did not use any lights for two reasons.. It'd give away my location for one.. Since I had no clue of what I was dealing with.. And two. The tree line was downright beyond thick so I knew I wouldnt see jack S anyway...\n\n  I'm now actively working with a few other video\/audio specialists to see if I can drown out the white noise and isolate the vocals and more... Will provide update(s) when it's done if interested!\n\n  During the exp.. I was picturing a main entity that looked kind of like an extremely malnourished humanoid figure (very boney and skinny) with dark brown to black - human like skin... That, in my own understanding.. Trapped souls (victims?) It was somehow holding on to them.. Maybe for spook factor? (No idea) And the two souls were male and child\/female, moving\/floating about around the main humanoid entity in a clock-wise circular type fluid motion. It's so difficult to describe... But that's what came to mind during exp.. And to tell you the truth.. As good as I am psychically.. I don't have a clue if I was accurate at all by any means with this one..\n\n  Also, if this is paranormal.. it's something I've NEVER dealt with.. Even cryptids could fit a spiritual sense if someone dives deep enough for info about em.. But again, no clue what this was..\n\n=======================\n\n**TLDR** I just arrived at an off grid campsite to cowboy camp.. About 10 mins go by and I begin hearing these these otherworldly blood curdling screaming sounds I barely even have a definition or words for... Far off in the South-East distance..  Caught it on video as I noticed it was coming closer.. Sounded like it was all around me at one point... Word screaming begun and then a rider came up shortly after chasing it.. Halted rider to ask. Didn't provide much info.. The rider took off as the sounds faded off in the North-West of my location.. No clue what it was....\n\n======================="},"148":{"title":"The Ankle Slasher","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsjias\/the_ankle_slasher\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Sealington33","selftext":"So, it started about a month or so ago. I was just about to start backing out of my parking spot at my job but I heard some sort of scratching sound coming from under the car. I stopped the engine and went to look under the car, but I saw nothing. I went to the other side of the car to check and see if it looked different from that side. Still, nothing. So I got back into the car and drove back home.\n\nThe next morning, I was wondering what the sound was, but I pushed it away, thinking it was probably a squirrel or something. I thought nothing of it, until around a week later. I heard the scratching sound again, but it was more intense and was faster. There were also sounds of something moving around, bumping against the bottom of the car. I got out of my car, just like the last time this had happened, and looked down under the car. There was, once again, nothing. I still thought it was a squirrel, but it was so weird that a squirrel would go under my car again, just a week later, and in the same spot.\n\nI drove home, and tried to look up whether anyone else had dealt with anything like this before. Nothing, so I looked up how common it was for squirrels to get under cars while they're parked, and there was also nothing. Most likely because they don't get statistics on squirrels under cars. I gave up, and tried thinking of any other explanations, but I couldn't think of anything other than a small animal. I was kinda confused, so I asked one of my friends about it. He joked that it was Alvin, and I laughed, but I couldn't really get the thought of something else happening out of my head.\n\nThe final time it happened, and also the reason why I was in the hospital in the first place, was 2 days ago. I heard the scratching. But it was mixed with whispers that I couldn't understand. The scratching sounded like it was chipping the paint off of the metal, or was digging through it entirely. I was terrified. When I heard it stop, I was deciding whether or not to check what was making that sound, and I was starting to drive away, but something flashed in my head.\n\nIt was an image of some creature inside of my bedroom window, with my house aflame. There was blood seeping from the windows, and a tower of smoke obscuring everything else in the picture. I blinked for a second, and I jumped, taking my foot off of the pedal. I was just sitting there, thinking of the image I had just seen, but there were honks littering my hearing. I realized I was blocking traffic, and pulled back into my spot.\n\nI really, truly didn't want to, but I knew, somehow, deep down, that the image would become reality if I didn't check. So I opened the door, and as soon as my leg touched down, I fell over. I felt a slice of pain in the back of my ankle, and there was a puddle of blood around my foot. I was seeing spots, and I soon blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in the hospital. A nurse looked over, and said \"Oh! You're awake.\" I looked around the room, at the bandage on my ankle, with a line of red right where I felt a tingle of pain, a lot less than I thought I would feel. I was trying to reach down to massage my ankle to help the pain, but the nurse stopped me. \"You can't touch the bandage, sweetie. It's gotta heal somehow.\"\n\nI asked how long I was out, and she said \"5 hours. You were smilin' in your sleep, though.\" I was thirsty, so I grabbed the cup of water on the table next to my bed. There were a couple of pills sitting next to it, but the nurse took them saying they must've fallen out of a bottle or something. 2 hours after this, and I was at my house, paying an Uber driver. I unlocked the door, and I immediately lied on the couch to rest. The rest doesn't matter, it's just recovery.\n\nThe weird part, though, is that I saw the hand holding the knife that sliced my ankle. And it was such a pale white, it couldn't have been human. I was bony. It looked like the hand of the creature who was in the image."},"149":{"title":"Stick Man Game","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fshjae\/stick_man_game\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"tturnttt","selftext":"Past the last house at the end of the dead-end street. Past the entrance to the trailhead and the big oak tree marked with a red strip of paint. Down along through the thick brush that skirted each side of the only sign of civilization. The path narrowed and then widened as it continued along each marked oak tree. Narrowing and widening. Narrowing and widening, down into a valley until it opened to a field with a stream running through it. Massive trees that reached the heavens surrounding  the basin from all angles. No cars could be heard here. No planes above. It was almost as if this place was completely untouched by society. Totally pristine and hidden to most of the world.\n\nThe kids grew up around here and knew the area like the backs of their hands. Past that first big oak tree marked with a thick red strip of paint, the kids knew that the sun disappeared. Down into the valley, they marched, hopping falling logs, and stopping to look at the deer as they ate berries just off the path.\n\nThere wasn’t much conversation as they trekked down the trail. Walking like soldiers in a platoon with a quiet confidence and preparedness that felt mature for their age. Kid 1, marching at the front of the line, broke the silence as he made sure his voice could be heard at the very back.\n\n“It’s a really, really fun game. And it’s not that hard to learn,” said Kid 1.\n\nKid 2 chimed in, “Yeah, we’ve been playin it for EVER and it never gets old!”\n\nAt the back of the line of the nine little hikers, New Kid shouted up to the front, “Cool! Thanks again for bringing me along. It’s so quiet here and really dark. You guys know where you’re going? Do you guys ever get scared? Your parents let you out here all alone? My parents don’t know where I am right now but they would never let me do this sort of thing. I should probably call them.” He rambled on before Kid 1 cut him off, “EVERYTHING IS FINE NEW KID,” he said forcefully but patiently. He told him not to worry about telling his parents.\n\nKids 2 through 8 all chimed in, in an odd unison, “Yeah new kid, we *know this area like the backs of our hands.”*\n\nNew Kid feeling betteased into the conversation, “So how does this game work anyway and how much longer till we’re there? I’m starting to get a little tired and we’re not even there yet!”\n\n“Not much further from here. See that bridge up the trail? That means we’ll be there soon.\n\nA sudden outburst from Kid 5 startled New Kid, “Tell him about the game, Kid 1. Tell him about the game!!!\n\n“STOP TALKING NOW Kid 5,” Kid 1 screeched, returning order back to the ranks. “It’s called Stick Man Game. We made it up soooo long ago,” said Kid 1.\n\nThe chorus of kids all chimed in chanting, *STICK MAN GAME. STICK MAN GAME.*\n\nKid 1 screamed now, “SHUT UP ALL OF YOU!!!!” then continued, “You ever play pin the tail on the donkey? It’s pretty much like that. Basically, we all stand around the biggest tree in the valley and everyone takes turns putting on this blindfold, everyone not blindfolded guides you to the tree where you use this knife to add an piece to a stick man, an arm or a leg or a…head.\n\n“Uhh that’s..that’s it? You just draw a stick man on a tree?” New Kid couldn’t hide his confusion.\n\nThe group screamed out again STICK MAN GAME!\n\nKid 1 explained, “We try to make the best stickman as possible, connecting all the parts together and try to make it look like a real person. It’s like a team bonding type of game, y’know? We all work together and as long as we talk it through, we usually do a pretty good job!”\n\nKew Kid didn’t ask many questions. He was just glad kids his age were letting him hang out with them. He just moved to the town by the trailhead a few months ago and because it was summer, he never really had a chance to make friends at school yet. \n\n“Ok sure, cool. Very cool,” New Kid agreed. “Sounds fun! Plus I get to carve up a tree with a knife? That thing is huge!”\n\n“Yeah that’s by FAR the best part,” said Kid1 \n\nDown further past the rickety-wooden bridge one hundred feet after the eighth and final oak tree with the thick red line. New Kid heard the faint gush of water that could only be the stream at the bottom of the valley that they had told him about. They marched across the bridge as it’s red paint chipped away down into the basin below.\n\nThe rush of the stream continued to get louder as the path narrowed and widened. Narrowed and widened. Until it became almost deafening. New Kid thought about covering his ears, but was already feeling self-conscious about playing it cool with his new friends. The noise grew to a deafening static that had a disorienting effect on him as he followed at the back of the line. Ahead of him, he could see a beam of light and an open field greener than any vegetable or blade of grass he’d ever seen.\n\nKid 1 said softly, “Well…this is it. I can’t believe we’re finally here.”\n\nKids 2 through 8 all cheered with a profound happiness that New Kid was unable to match, some of them even shedding tears when they got there.\n\nNew Kid was in awe, “Wow, it’s. It’s beautiful?” He spun around taking it all in, his stomach suddenly churning. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread surrounded by all the lush beauty around him. The static of the stream began to muffle the shrieks of the boys, and he didn’t notice as kids 2-8 started to fall to their knees and throw their bodies to the ground as if they were trying to hug the core of the earth.\n\nKid 1 wasting no time, “Ok. Let’s get started. There it is over there.” He pointed to a massive tree that sat just on the edge of the valley. The group made their way over to the tree, all still shrieking. Kid 1 lined them up at the base and began barking orders, “THIS IS IT! WE’VE WAITED FOR THIS. IT’S FINALLY TIME!”\n\nThe group erupted into a roar: STICK MAN GAME. STICK MAN GAME.\n\nNew Kid fell into a trance following along with the orders, not really understanding why or how he was moving his feet still disoriented from the sound of the stream. The constant static hovering over all his new friends’ voices.\n\nKid 2 passed the blindfolds down the line where they all placed them over their eyes blacking out the sunlight that rained down into the valley. New Kid grew increasingly nervous as Kid 2 handed him his blindfold. “Don’t worry New Kid, we’ve been playing this game for EVER. It doesn’t take long. The first time is the hardest.”\n\nA wave of panic washed over him, and he fell deeper into a fugue state. He followed his orders, waiting his turn in line, head spinning as the darkness of the blindfold created images in his head. Flashes of faces: smiling, frowning, laughing. Crying. Screaming. He became even more entranced. He could feel his feet moving forward as the static of  the stream roared in his ears.\n\n*STICK MAN GAME. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. STICK MAN GAME.* He heard repeatedly. The voices of kids 2 through 8 faded away and the chanting voices seemed to be coming from inside his own head.\n\n*STICK MAN GAME. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. STICK MAN GAME.*\n\nHis feet floated across the ground, slowly moving forward to the front of the line. He heard continuous soft squishing sounds and dull grunts.\n\n*STICK MAN GAME. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. STICK MAN GAME. Over and over.*\n\nFinally he came to the front of the line. As he settled into the darkness, the static of the stream and the chanting voices slowly lifted and he could hear birds chirping. A relief within the chaos of the last few moments.\n\nHe was handed the knife by Kid 2, and he heard Kid 1 say from directly in front of him in the calm voice that he spoke in earlier. “Go ahead new kid, plunge the knife.”\n\nThe birds continued to chirp. He trembled. Overwhelmed with fear, but unable to question any of this. He felt his hand robotically move forward. He had no control over it. Swiftly, he jabbed expecting to feel the firm bark of the tree, but it was soft. Next he heard a groan, “ughhhhgooof…thank you.” Silence.\n\n*Thank you?* Did he hear someone say thank you?\n\n“It’s over.”\n\nNew Kid lifted up his blindfold and was horrified to see Kid 1 with 8 gauges in his chest bleeding profusely. He collapsed on the ground, and New Kid rushed over to him as he lay there dying. The chorus of kids were screaming, “STICK MAN GAME!! STICK MAN GAME!!!”\n\nHovering over Kid1, New Kid saw that he had a smile on his face and was reaching for the knife.\n\n“HELP!!! HELP US!!! HELP!!!” New Kid cried. “PLEASE HELP US!! WHAT DID WE JUST DO??”\n\nKid 2 said calmly, “It’s all over now New Kid. We don’t need help anymore. We’re all saved.”\n\nNew Kid looked back at Kid 1 who was holding the knife and staring at him.\n\n“Thank you. It’s time to go home.” He plunged the knife into an empty spot on his own gushing sternum. As he pulled the knife out, the static of the stream roared back into focus. The ground began to shake, and New Kid’s vision began to blur around the edges. The stream slowly broke open to reveal a cavernous firepit so deep you could never reach the end of it.\n\n*STICK MAN GAME. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. PLUNGE THE KNIFE. STICK MAN GAME.*\n\nThe kids cheered and began throwing themselves into the fire pit until Kid 1, the last one left, rolled into the pit as New Kid watched helplessly.\n\nThe gates were opened once again."},"150":{"title":"I know this is kinda random, but I felt like it would be interesting to share.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fshi2z\/i_know_this_is_kinda_random_but_i_felt_like_it\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Commercial_Sorbet552","selftext":"I overcame my fear of viral creepypastas with porn of the said creepypastas."},"151":{"title":"This is what took my mother so this is what i became.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fs498d\/this_is_what_took_my_mother_so_this_is_what_i\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Big-Jicama9039","selftext":"\"the yzo\" or tiwtmmstiwib is e creature that haunts children in populated places when this creature is hungry it goes and finds a child (that has only the mom) it follows it home and waits for the child and the mother to fall asleep.

Now I was the champion at tempting among the hell realm 5 years ago and now I have someone who has challenged me. I admit I haven't done much tempting in the last 5 years but i was sure that I will still win. Any how apparently this demon was so good at tempting humans, that his very presence made humans want to sin. Now I was a little intimidated by this demon but i was ready to go and I believed in myself. \n\nSo I had to tempt a farmer to kill the other farmer who is the competition for him. I spoke into his ear and he literally killed the other farmer. He walked into his farm and with a shot gun he shot him down. Now there was a moment of hesitation from the killer farmer but my temptation made him kill. The other demon literally showed off when he made a nun, yes that's right a nun, and made her stab people on the street. I was definitely taken aback by this and usually religious people are hard to beat. \n\nNow I played it safe and I went to a person with a criminal record, and I whispered in his  ear to rob an old lady. He succumbed to my temptation straight away. Then the other demon literally went to a church leader and he tempted him into murdering some of the church goers. It was incredible to see and i was becoming afraid. I should also mention that if I lose then he gets all my legion of demons that fall under me. This is also the same for the other demon if he loses, I get all of his legions of demons for me to rule. \n\nNow when I tried to tempt another person with a criminal record to kill someone, the other demon heckled out to me and said \"come on pick a religious person with no criminal record to tempt into damnation!\" And I felt the pressure straight away. I went to a repentant man who prays to God everyday now. I tried tempting him go kill someone but he was resisting. It wasn't a good look at all and I tried tempting him again to go and kill someone again, he resisted. \n\nThen that other demon literally went up to him and spoke once to him go go and kill, and the repentant man killed someone.

A recently declassified document, available on Amazon, recounts the horror of a family of doctors who pushed the boundaries of humanity. In Elmwood, Wisconsin, there lies a farm, but behind its walls lurks a dark past rooted in the depths of World War II.\n\nHans, a doctor whose name resonates with echoes of suffering, operated in concentration camps. After the war, he was smuggled to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, where he continued his inhumane experiments, leaving indelible scars on the souls of his victims. His family, hungry for power, took up his cruel mantle, perpetuating a cycle of horror within their estate. Lost souls, the homeless, the invisible to society, were captured and subjected to unspeakable treatments. In the general indifference, these disappearances occurred, their screams muffled by a complicit silence.\n\nYet, light can sometimes pierce the darkness. Janis, Michael's twin sister, dared to expose these abominable acts. Her cry of despair put an end to years of suffering and secrets. However, the FBI, intent on preserving its image, buried this truth, hiding the origins of the evil haunting Elmwood.\n\nIt was only through Laurie Springwood, an intrepid journalist with a keen instinct and unwavering determination, that the document titled \"The Regis Family Files\" emerged from the limbo of the past. Bit by bit, the story infiltrates minds, sending chills down the spines of those who hear it.\n\nI have a friend, Bryan, a fervent urban explorer. When he heard about this sinister tale, his eyes lit up with excitement, like a hunter facing his prey. Along with Connie, he plans to explore the farm in a week or two. But I stand aside, fear knotting in my stomach, as I no longer live in that state.\n\nIt’s unsettling that this story remained in the shadows for so long. Bryan and Connie want to kick off their urban exploration channel with this site, but I can't shake the feeling that they are about to tread into a place where the past clings, where unconfessed secrets wait to be awakened.\n\nThe paranormal isn’t just about ghosts and apparitions. Sometimes, it lies in buried secrets, in the muffled cries of those who have suffered. What if the true monsters are not creatures of nightmare, but men themselves, those who, in the dark, perpetuate the horror?"},"158":{"title":"Strange Rules: THE SOCIAL MEDIA MODERATOR","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fs7dni\/strange_rules_the_social_media_moderator\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"Hynos_Stories","selftext":"Getting a job as a moderator for one of the world’s largest social media platforms, something like Facebook, seemed like a good opportunity. \n\nThe job was simple: review reported posts, remove inappropriate content, and ensure everything stayed within the community guidelines. I worked from home at night, as my shift was from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., the quietest hours. At least, that’s what I thought. \n\nThe first few weeks were normal. Occasionally, I’d come across weird posts, insults, disturbing images, but nothing unusual for a platform of that size. However, in the group chat, some of the night shift moderators began reporting strange situations and phenomena, requesting review by the cybersecurity staff. \n\nA few days later, I received a direct email from the admin team. \n\nSubject: Instructions for Night Moderators – Security Protocol \n\n\"Dear moderator, \n\nWe hope this message finds you well and that your experience with our night shift team is going smoothly. \n\nIn light of several incidents reported in recent days, we are pleased to inform you that our cybersecurity team has conducted the necessary investigations and established a series of protocols that must be strictly followed during the night shift to ensure the safety of both the platform and its staff. \n\n**THESE PROTOCOLS ARE MANDATORY, AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW THEM COULD RESULT IN FATAL AND UNDESIRED CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL.** \n\nBelow is a set of rules that apply exclusively to those working the night shift (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.). We emphasize that these guidelines have been established based on previously identified situations and are mandatory.\" \n\nI read the guidelines, and an overwhelming sense of unease washed over me. These people never spoke lightly or joked with the staff, yet these rules seemed anything but normal. \n\n \n\nRules for Night Moderators of the Social Network \n\n1. The Dot Post. \n\nIf you find a post with no text or images, only a single period (\".\") as a description, delete it immediately. Do not attempt to open it or read the comments. If you do, your connection will drop, and when you return, you’ll see something you shouldn’t have. \n\n2. The Report Surge. \n\nIf you receive more than 99 reports in under 10 seconds, log out immediately and wait 15 minutes before reconnecting. During that time, ignore any email notifications. \n\n3. The Numbered Account. \n\nIf you review an account with a username that is just a sequence of numbers (like 8451976739), check how many friends or followers they have. If the number exceeds 10, don’t just block the account — disconnect your router. The account won’t disappear until you do. \n\n4. The Impossible Language. \n\nIf you encounter a post in a language you don’t recognize, don’t use any translators. Don’t try to understand it, and under no circumstances should you enter it into a translator. Delete the post immediately. \n\n5. The 3:33 a.m. Disconnection. \n\nEvery night at 3:33 a.m., you must log out for exactly 3 minutes. If you receive notifications during that time, don’t open them. When you return, make sure the report count isn’t at 0. If it is, report it to Security, log out, and unplug your computer. Don’t turn it back on for 24 hours. \n\n6. Reactions Without Comments. \n\nIf you find a post with more than 10,000 reactions but not a single comment, delete it without reading it. These reactions were not made by users. \n\n7. The Message with Your Full Name. \n\nIf a private message from an unknown user contains only your full name, change all your passwords. Do not open any other messages until you’ve done this. \n\n8. Your Doppelgänger. \n\nIf you find a profile identical to yours or another moderator’s, don’t interact with it. Report the account directly to the admins. Do not attempt to delete it yourself. \n\n9. The Invisible Image. \n\nIf a reported image doesn’t appear to be visible or available, don’t try to unlock or restore it. Just delete the report and move on. If you manage to see it, it will stay in your gallery forever. \n\n10. The Endless Video. \n\nIf you come across a video that doesn’t end after 10 minutes, stop watching it immediately. No matter how curious you are, the video won’t stop on its own, and every minute you keep watching, more details about your life will appear in it. \n\n11. The Empty Profile. \n\nIf you review an account that has no posts, photos, or friends but has been active for over a year, close the tab immediately. \n\n12. The Mirror User. \n\nIf you see your reflection on the screen instead of the profile image, turn off your computer immediately. Don’t continue browsing. \n\n13. The Missed Call. \n\nIf you receive a call from an unknown number while on your shift, don’t answer it. If you do, someone on the other side will speak to you in a language you won’t understand, but you’ll remember their words for the rest of your life. \n\n14. The Final Email. \n\nIf you receive an email from the platform with the subject \"Thank you for your service,\" do not open it. Your shift isn’t over yet. \n\n \n\nMy curiosity grew, but I decided to follow the rules. I didn’t want to lose a good job just because of some weird guidelines. \n\nThe first few nights after receiving the message passed without incident, though I noticed some things that matched the rules: posts with dots, users with numeric names, even posts in strange languages. I deleted them without a second thought, as instructed. \n\nBut one night, around 3:00 a.m., my moderator panel went haywire. Over 150 reports came in within 10 seconds. I remembered the second rule. I logged out immediately and anxiously waited the recommended 15 minutes. It felt like something was watching my every move. After the time passed, I logged back in. Everything seemed under control, but something felt off. \n\nAt 3:33 a.m., I logged out of the platform for 3 minutes, as the fifth rule instructed. During those three minutes, my inbox began to fill with notifications. Each one had the same subject: \"Pending Review: Special Post.\" I didn’t open any of them. \n\nWhen the time was up, I returned to the platform and tried to ignore what had happened, but my heart was pounding. A few days later, I received a private message from an unknown user. The message contained only two words: \"David Howard.\" My full name. \n\nI remembered the seventh rule. Without hesitation, I logged out and changed all my passwords. I tried not to dwell on it, but a feeling of paranoia started to build up. \n\nI began noticing strange things on my profile: an old childhood photo appeared in my gallery, though I had never uploaded it. My friends list showed a duplicate of myself—a profile with my picture, my name, but it wasn’t mine. I reported it to the admins, but received no response. I followed the rules and didn’t delete the profile myself, but each time I checked, there seemed to be more activity on that account, as if someone was using my identity on the platform. \n\nOn my last night working, I reviewed a post that seemed to be in an indecipherable language, filled with strange symbols. I remembered the fourth rule, but something about that post drew me in. I don’t know why I did it, but I copied it into a translator. \n\nThe language was Akkadian, and the message said: \"And there are those who have dared to peer beyond the Veil, and to accept Him as their guide, but they would have shown greater prudence by not making any deal with Him. \n\nMy computer froze, the system shut down, and the lights in my room flickered. When the screen returned, I was on the homepage, but something had changed. My profile was no longer mine. Someone had taken control of my account. \n\nAnd from that moment on, every post, every image, and every comment seemed to be directed at me, though no one else seemed to notice. \n\n\"Hello, David.\" \n\n\"#davidverifyyourid.\" \n\nI saw it everywhere, on every post. My headphones began emitting a strange, disturbing static. With sweaty hands, I threw them across the table and unplugged them. \n\nSuddenly, my laptop began making a deafening noise, the kind old CPUs used to make when a nearby phone received an incoming call. But I was working on a laptop, so what the hell...? \n\nI turned on the lights and hastily opened my phone. The selfie camera was on, and the phone wasn’t responding to any other buttons to shut it down or return to the home screen. All I could see was my face surrounded by darkness. The lights were on, so how was this possible? \n\nOn the verge of panic, I threw myself to the floor and yanked the laptop’s power cord out. The lights started flickering, and the temperature began to drop. My instincts kicked in one last time, and I ran out of the room, racing down the dark hallway with tears streaming down my face and my heart pounding, until I reached the fuse box. I flipped all the switches off in one go and collapsed with my back against the wall. \n\nA deathly silence followed. I waited for what felt like centuries, though only five minutes passed, until my breathing finally calmed. I stood up and turned the fuses back on. I turned on all the lights in the house and entered the room. Everything was exactly as I’d left it. The phone seemed to be working normally. But I had lost my internet connection and couldn’t reconnect to the Wi-Fi with my password. I didn’t bother checking the laptop—I threw it straight in the trash. I didn’t sleep a wink that night. \n\nI quit the next day and switched internet providers. But since then, every time I log onto the social network, I feel like something or someone is watching me. Posts continue to appear, with comments and messages that seem to know details about my private life. And sometimes, at 3:33 a.m., I get a notification from an account with my own picture, requesting to be friends. I haven’t accepted it... yet. \n\nIf you like it, [subscribe to youtube channel for more stories!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@Hypnosstories)"},"159":{"title":"The Family Farm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsbw0d\/the_family_farm\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Kennis0505","selftext":"\nBeing the oldest child, Mark knew he would end up with the family property. He just didn’t know it would be this soon. His father’s health had been going downhill, so he moved his wife and kids back to the old homestead. It was a massive decision, but he wanted to make sure his dad was receiving the proper care he needed. Of course, his siblings didn’t offer. They only cared about themselves. They would be no help.\r\n\nWith all the change and the stress of this move, Mark decided to take a walk into the woods to clear his head. He had always loved this place. His home sweet home was a 500-acre piece of heaven nestled in the Ozarks. If he hadn’t been so ready to experience the world, he probably would have never left. He knew this place better than himself. He knew every fallen tree, every rock face, and every spring. However, after thirty minutes of walking, he stumbled on something he had never seen before...a cabin.\r\nThe sight of the old cabin shocked him to his core. He had walked this particular trail hundreds of times. This cabin wasn’t here before. It couldn’t have been here before. As he stepped onto the porch, he could tell it was old but it wasn’t in bad shape. The old iron latch slid easy and the door opened wide. It was a humble home with three rooms. The main room consisted of a fireplace and a wood cook stove. There were two empty rooms on both sides of the living area, he assumed were bedrooms. \r\n\nHe was surprised he hadn’t run face first into a spider’s web yet. He grabbed his phone and turned on the flashlight. He didn't see any cobwebs in the corners. The house was empty except for the old cookstove and a beautiful, antique table with a book on it laying in front of the captain's chair. The table and book didn’t have the first hint of dust on them. That’s strange, he thought to himself.\r\n \r\n\r\nHe sat down in the chair; curiosity getting the better of him. He opened the book and realized it was a diary. Even though he felt wrong, he couldn’t help but read at least one entry.\r\n\nJune 6, 1806\r\nPa is worried the livestock ain’t gonna make it. The trip was rough and they aren’t acting right. He’s starting to regret buying this piece of property. My objection fell on his deaf ears. Of course, he wouldn’t listen to a girl even if I am his only child. Ma is sick. She’s ate up with consumption. I wish we had never left Virginia.\r\n\nAfter reading this, he couldn’t walk away.\r\n\nJune 8, 1806\r\nIf things don’t change, we won’t have anything left. Majority of our livestock is dead or has went missing. The rocky ground ain’t fit for growing crops and Ma ain’t been out of bed for two days. I don’t got time to write because there’s so much that needs done around here.\r\n“My god!” Mark whispered to himself. What an awful situation. I have to know how they dealt with it. So, he continued:\r\n\nJune 18, 1806\r\nToday was an odd but wonderful day! I was awakened by Pa’s screams for Ma. She had vanished and after hours of searching we had all but given up. However, Ma came struttin’ in like she had never been sick at all. It was a miracle! It is so nice to have her back. I’ve missed her so.\r\n \r\n\r\nJune 22, 1806\r\nIt seems our struggles are over. After Ma got better, all our livestock that had vanished found their way back. The crops have found new life in this rocky ground. God has smiled down on us for sure. The only thing eaten at me; I swear I can see something in the trees. Pa said it’s all in my head and that I should just be glad things are finally working out. It’s probably just stress.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1806\r\nEverything is better than could be expected. I’m still seeing the shadows moving in the trees. I quit bringing it up to Pa though. He’s starting to question my sanity. I’m glad we aren’t in Virginia anymore. He would have me committed, especially for what I told him about Ma. I heard her talking to herself saying, “I can't do it.” over and over. The only look she gives me is one of sorrow. I’m just so confused.\r\n\r\nJuly 7, 1806\r\nWe have a problem. It started with the squirrels and the rabbits. They started circling the house, single-file. That was early morning. By midday, the deer and coyotes had joined. By this evening, the bears and the wildcats followed suit. They ain’t trying to attack us. Pa stepped outside to scare them off. They flat out ignored him. I don’t think there’ll be much sleep tonight.\r\n\r\n“What the hell kind of dairy is this?”, Mark thought to himself. This has got to be some kind of prank. He put the diary down and started to walk away. But there was a nagging in him. He had to know what happened. He walked back over and sat back down.\r\n\r\nJuly 8, 1806\r\nThese critters are walking on two legs like men and more have joined through the night. I’m so scared. This doesn’t make any sense. It’s now on dinnertime and they have started howling, growling, and screeching together in a pattern. Almost like singing a church hymnal. I feel like it’s going to be another long night. \r\n\r\nJuly 9, 1806\r\nThe Godforsaken chanting from these damn animals is so loud it feels like the cabin is vibrating. Pa tried to get through them and got hurt real bad. It’s the strangest thing though. It wasn’t from one of the hell beasts as we started calling them. As soon as he stepped out, something we couldn’t see, picked him up and threw him back into the cabin. We heard an awful snap and his legs were twisted at the knees. I’m not sure how much more we can take.\r\n\r\nWe lost Pa a few hours after I last wrote, but he didn’t pass from his injuries. The chanting got even louder after he had tried to get out. All I know is Pa let out a chilling scream and blood poured from his ears then he was gone. Ma is in a daze. I can’t say that I blame her.\r\n \r\n\r\nJuly 10, 1806\r\nI should stop writing in this, but I figure if I die, I want someone to know what happened here. Ma’s mind is gone. She keeps apologizing to Pa’s lifeless body saying it’s all her fault. I finally hit my breaking point and screamed at her. I told her she needs to get a grip and help me figure out what to do. That’s when she told me she had made a deal with something she couldn’t see. She said she had summoned a creature most awful. In exchange for her health and prosperity with Pa, she’d give me up. Her mind is broken. That old world nonsense is just that. Nonsense. It’s gotten quiet. I’m just scared to look outside. I think I’m gonna try to sleep this evening. I’ll figure a way out in the morning.\r\n\r\nJuly 11, 1806\r\nThis morning there was a knock at the door. I answered it hoping this nightmare was over. In the doorway, there was a tall handsome fella about my age. I rushed him into the cabin, quickly looking to see if the Hell beasts were anywhere. “They’re gone Lass,” said the man in an accent similar to Ma’s. He turned to Ma and she let out a scream. He cackled in response. “You thought you could skip out on our deal, huh? Well, as you can see, we don’t really like being taken advantage of.” Ma went to speak but was cut short when the Pale Devil ripped her tongue out of her mouth and began to chew on it. After what seemed like an eternity, he turned towards me and what was said between us will remain between us. Unless it concerns your fate. If so, this conversation will be revealed at that appointed time.\r\n \r\nAfter that last entry, Mark threw the diary against the wall and sat there in awe. He was trying to wrap his head around this bizarre journal, finding this weird cabin, and wondering if he was losing his mind. \n\nA familiar voice interrupted his thoughts. “I see you found the old homestead and you great-great Grandma Kate’s diary.” Confused, I asked, “What’s going on here Dad? I’ve walked this trail a million times and have never seen this cabin here.” His Dad couldn’t meet his eyes as he began revealing the disturbing truth of their family. “Son, everything in that diary was real. Everything is revealed to you now because you have to carry on this curse. All the prosperity that I have had, you will now have. You have to bring the creature your first born.” All the air had been sucked out of the room. “The hell I will! You have lost your mind. I’m not giving up any of my kids. This isn’t real, Pops. I’m your first born and I’m standing right in front of you. You didn’t give me up.” His health was worse than he thought. Maybe he had undiagnosed Schizophrenia. “You had an older brother,” he said as tears welled up in his eyes. “When the cabin appeared to me, my father and I had this same conversation.”\r\n\n“Bullshit!” Mark exclaimed. “Son, please calm down and listen. The Fae folks struck a deal with Kate. On top of money and success, any evidence of the first born will be erased. No one will remember then, except for you.” Mark just stared in disbelief; he knew his father's health was deteriorating but he never figured it would mess with his mind this much. He softened his voice and suggested to his father, “Let's get you home Pops, you really need to rest.” As he walked towards to the old man, a cackle came from one of the empty rooms and there stood the pale man himself. \r\n \r\nKate had him pegged, he is a handsome feller pale skin and light hair, but what she failed to mention was the milky white eyes. Mark Jumped in front of his father and squared off ready the fight, the Fae Man just laughed even louder.\n\n “What are you gonna do lad?”He quizzed Mark. He started to speak when the pale man cut him off “Everything he told you is true. When your ancestors old homestead appears, it’s time to pay the debt that is owed.” Mark couldn’t believe this was happening and the Fae Man continued, “You seem like a good man, you are probably thinking you can find another way to break your families deal, but that is why every new generation finds the diary. You read it So you learn what will happen if you don’t pay.” Mark’s eyes welled up with tears, He knew he could beat this somehow, he just had to find away. The Fae man spoke again “I’ve seen that look before, and if you don’t bring me what is owed tonight, I’m gonna have myself a little fun with your wife and make you watch as I peel the hide from her and feed it to your children!” After that he vanished.\r\n\nAs Mark helped his father back home, he made his decision. He would run with his family and never look back; there was no way he would give his child over to that pale Devil. Every curse can be broken, there is always a loop hole he just had to find it and find it quick.\r\n\nHis eyes popped open, and he very warily sat up in bed. The one thing his poor old dad forgot to mention about the curse is the guilt in dream form. He didn’t try to run like he wanted to and the guilt of that eats at him every morning when he wakes and since his wife passed away last June, his health had been going downhill, he had been checking the trail once a week he checked for the old homestead to appear, three weeks ago it showed up and Mark knew what needed to do. His son will to be moved in by the end of the week. It’s time to pass down the farm to the next generation."},"160":{"title":"The Student ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fsb1l3\/the_student\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"Sourcake_YT","selftext":"I posted this on my tumblr which is mythlorenightstar and I will show I own the account if needed.\n\nTw: blood, murder, death, body parts\nThe Student\n\nThere's a legend about a forest by a school in Louisiana, it's said the forest is habituated by a student who was killed there.\n\nBut no one knows who the student as the school was at least 50~60 years old, but that's not the point anyone who enters the forest never come out as on certain days, they change at least every year at this point blood, and dismembered body parts appear all around the town.\n\nAs there was footage of when a fucking idiot streamer went into the forest and streamed it got some looked at the student and they were scary there face was bloody and broken.\n\nAs now everyone called them the student.\nBut that didn't matter anymore as they kept changing, first they female, then male as it was scary as they would appear in one place outside of the forest but always at night people know to have lights on to make sure they didn't appear in their house to kill them but that doesn't matter.\n\nThey would talk to little children who if their parents are dead were abusive.\n\nIf teenagers died they cause someone else to die.\n\nHonestly The Student motives are confusing like they are changing from person to another all at once at different times of the day."},"161":{"title":"This one time at Bandcamp ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fs24al\/this_one_time_at_bandcamp\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Topneighborhood_859","selftext":"The first and last time at band camp. I was thirteen, but I was small for my age. I was also very skinny. I never really fit in at school. The only interactions I had with my classmates were of the other kids making fun of me. It didn’t help that I was naturally introverted or that I was two years behind everyone else, as far as size went. As a result, I didn’t have many friends. Or any friends… to be honest. \n\nThe only thing I was good at was music. I played the saxophone and I was actually pretty good at it. My parents decided to send me to band camp this summer to help me “nurture my gift” whatever that meant. I heard them talking. My dad was worried about how much it would cost. My mom knew they couldn’t really afford it but they could make it work. My mom pleaded. She begged him.”Joey needs to make some friends. And the only hobby he has is playing music. Maybe he can meet some people with similar interests and come out of his shell.”\n\nMy dad finally agreed and when they proposed they idea to me I couldn’t refuse knowing how much it meant to my mom. \n\nBut, band camp wasn’t any different than school. I spent all day keeping my head down. I avoided eye contact with the other kids. One morning at breakfast I found a giant spider in my oatmeal and screamed bloody murder. And everyone in the cafeteria pointed and laughed at me. A large, zit-faced kid plucked the rubber spider out of my oatmeal and presented it to the kids. They cheered and laughed harder realizing I had been the victim of a prank. \n\nThe next three days were relentless, rubber snakes… itching powder… bengay in my underwear… It went on and on with everyone laughing at me. Then, one of the instructors pulled me aside. “Joey, they will keep picking on you if you give them the reaction they want. The next time they try to prank you, ignore them. If they don’t get the reaction they want, they will move on to someone else.”\n\nI took his advice and for the rest of the day I ignored them. Prank after prank. I avoided the urge to react. I even paid extra attention to my surroundings which paid off when they tried to jump out and scare me. \n\nTonight, we were supposed to play a piece outside as a group but there was a storm coming in and the rehearsal was canceled. The instructors were certain we would still have time to practice for the show at the end of camp when our parents came to pick us up.\n\nAbout an hour ago a thick fog rolled in and the kids have been talking about how you can’t see three feet in front of you. “It’s werewolf fog!” one of the kids yelled as he looked out of our cabin window. He turned to me and with spirit fingers repeated himself menacingly “werewolf fog…”\n\nI ignored them. “Joey, I bet you won’t go out there.” One of them challenged me. I kept my head down. “Joey’s too chicken.” Another kid added.\n\nImmediate silence fell over the cabin when we heard the howl. A chill went down my spine and I almost lost my cool. But then I reminded myself of what the instructor had told me. They are going to keep pranking as long as I fall for it.\n\nThere was another howl, louder and closer this time. It sounded so real. The other kids in the cabin were pretending to be scared and began looking out the windows. Then there was the scream. A loud, agonizing scream from outside. The kids kept up the act and one of them proposed someone go get a counselor. Someone outside could be hurt. Another proposed they put the bunk bed in front of the door to keep the werewolf out. \n\nFinally they agreed that Frank, the biggest kid, would go. He grabbed his flute and wielded it like a weapon and opened the door. Frank stood in the doorway for a minute looking into the fog. I couldn’t see the steps on the porch and they were only a few feet away from the door. Frank tenderly stepped out into the fog. I couldn’t see him anymore but I heard the steps creaked under him as he stepped down. \n\nEveryone stared out of the door for at least a minute. There was complete silence except for the sound of the group breathing heavily. And then Frank screamed. I heard rushed footsteps in the leaves as he ran back to the cabin. He plowed through the group at the door, knocking one kid to the ground. Frank collapsed right in front of me. He clutched at his throat. Blood spurted from his neck onto the ground and onto my feet. \n\nThe other kids kept up the act and screamed as Frank gurgled and gasped. He stretched one hand out for me and then went limp. His eyes were wide open staring at me. \n\nI have to give him credit. He may be a bully but he is a great actor. He isn’t even blinking. A kid, maybe a counselor, he’s really tall, has just entered the cabin. He is wearing a werewolf costume. Somehow, fake blood is spraying all over the cabin as he pretends to maul my roommates. It looks so real. It even has the same, copper smell as real blood. And the screams… the level of dedication they are putting into this prank is unbelievable. \n\nBut, I’m not falling for this one. I’m going to sit right here and keep writing this. \n\nHold on. All of the other kids are playing dead. The man in the werewolf costume is walking over to me… I bet he’s about to tell me it was a joke.\n"},"162":{"title":"\"Buried In Hanging Hills\" by Tristan Mason","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fs8ef6\/buried_in_hanging_hills_by_tristan_mason\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"TheGlawackus","selftext":"I recently narrated my story[ \"Buried In Hanging Hills.\"](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ViliMuPGV2E?si=T9Va8vD6R6eigXz4) It's the fourth story from my upcoming novel, Nutmeg Horror, a collection of short fiction stories based on chilling legends in Connecticut.

They wouldn’t believe me if I did. You may not either. About a month ago I had just gotten out of class when I checked my phone. To my surprise I had a voicemail from my father. Sure, mom has called me from time to time since I left for college, but when I saw that my father had called me I knew it had to be bad news. I just didn’t know how bad. \n\n“Son, we’re buying you a plane ticket. You need to fly home tonight. There… has been an accident. Call me when you get this.” That’s all the voicemail said. I called them and he explained that my grandfather had been killed in an accident with his combine while harvesting corn. And that the shock of finding him had given my grandmother a heart attack.\n\nThe flight was nerve racking. I have never done well with small spaces. And I couldn’t smoke on the flight which made it even worse. I spent the whole flight fidgeting and walking back and forth to the restroom even though I didn’t need to go. I just needed to move around.\n\nMy dad was already waiting for me when I landed which ruined my plan of sneaking a cigarette before he showed. He gave me a hug and helped me load my bag in the car. I decided I needed a cigarette bad enough and lit one up in the parking garage. My dad had never seen me smoke and I tried to act as casually as I could. He raised an eyebrow at me as he closed the trunk. \n\nI waited for a lecture or an outburst but all he did was nod. “That’s a nice lighter.” He said. I hadn’t realized I was still fidgeting with it. I handed him the vintage trench lighter. “Ellen, my uh… girlfriend bought it for me a few weeks ago. Found it at an antique store in Seattle.” \n\nHe took it in his hand and looked it over approvingly. Then he handed it back. “No smoking in the car. Your mother would never let us hear the end of it.” He instructed. My headache was gone now that I had a sufficient amount of nicotine. I threw the cigarette down and stomped it out with my foot. \n\nAN hour later we were back at my parent’s house. My mother greeted me with a hug. Then she stepped back and looked me up and down. “Your father used to smoke menthols too when he was your age.” She said and gave my father a smirk. \n\nI wasn’t sure if I was embarrassed she had caught me or surprised my dad used to smoke. He gave me a pat on the shoulder and walked into the house. \n\nWe spent the night catching up on what I had been up to while I was in college. They filled me in on how their business was struggling but they were keeping their head above water. And then eventually my dad filled me in on the details of the funeral. They had decided to do a closed casket on both of my grandparents. The injuries that my grandfather had received apparently were too gruesome for an open casket. And they did a closed casket on my grandmothers so that people would ask why. \n\nThe next morning we attended the funeral. There were only a few people. My grandparents were in their eighties and had very few friends that were still around. Afterwards we went back to my parents house and ate. \n\n“Son, your mom and I have talked about this. We need to sell your grandparent’s farm. We have neither the time or money for the upkeep. If you can take a week off school and clean the place up, you know, get it ready to sell… we will give you twenty five percent of whatever we get when it sells.” My father explained. \n\nI took a large bite of chicken and chewed it as I thought it over. I could call the school and explain the situation. And I could easily catch up later. “Yeah, I can do that. But, what do you mean, clean it up. How bad is it?” I asked.\n\nMy father and mother exchanged a worried look before she looked back down at her plate. “Just before your grandfather passed your grandmother called me. She told me that he had been diagnosed with dementia.. Between that and their diminished health I suspect that the property is in pretty bad shape.” \n\n“You haven’t been out there?” I asked. It wasn’t more than a couple of hours away. I couldn’t believe they hadn’t been to visit.\n\nMy mother replied in a defensive tone. “We have both been working seven days a week at the shop. We had to let all of our employees go. Business is not going too well.” \n\nI nodded and asked what the plan was. \n\n“I will drive you out tomorrow. You can stay there until I pick you up friday. That gives you six days to get things boxed up. I already ordered the boxes. They will be delivered tomorrow. \n\nThe following day my father drove me up to the old farm. I spent a few weekends there as a kid. The place always had a creepy vibe but it was fun. I could walk through the corn all day and never reach the end. \n \nAs we pulled in there was a large scarecrow. That stood over the corn at the edge of the field. “When did they get that thing?” I asked. My dad didn’t answer. Instead, he looked at it out of the corner of his eye. His face contorted into a look of intense worry… maybe fear. I couldn’t tell. As we passed the scarecrow I looked back. The wind hit it just right and for a second, I would have sworn it turned its head to watch us.\n\nAbout twenty minutes after I had been dropped off I was still wandering through the house, evaluating the countless knick knacks and pictures. Trying to decide what should be kept, sold or tossed. The phone rang. My heart skipped a beat. It had been so long since I had heard a landline ring I thought it might be the fire alarm. \n\nI answered it. “This is Jim. I am delivering the boxes you ordered but my GPS doesn’t work out here. Can you give me directions?” The man asked. \n\n“Head down old county road about five miles. Make a right at the dirt road.” I said. I tried to think of a landmark knowing how vague that was. “You’ll see a scarecrow. Make a right at the scarecrow.”\n\nThe man thanked me and hung up. About a half hour later I was washing the dishes in the sink and cleaning up the kitchen. My grandmother must have just set out lunch before the accident because there were two plates of food on the table. It was so rotten I couldn’t tell what it was anymore. \n\nThe pungent smell of mold and rotten food was making me gag so I had to open the kitchen window. I listened to the windchimes on the porch and found it rather relaxing. I began to wonder how many summer days my grandparents sat out on the porch, sipped sweet tea and listened to the wind. \n\nOver the windchimes I heard a scream from the field. I shut off the water and letened closer. I heard the scream again. Almost as if someone was howling in pain. I rushed outside and stood at the edge of the corn. My grandfather had waited too long to harvest his crop. THe sun had bleached the corn until it was now the color of bone. The stalks waved back and forth in the wind. The dry leaves rustled against each other as they swayed.\n\nI heard the noise again and began to walk out into the field toward the noise. “Hello?” I yelled. I passed row after row of maize, looking left and right in the eight inches of space between rows. And then, in the distance I saw a figure move. I began to run after it. I caught glimpses of the figure every few seconds as the wind allowed. \n\nAfter a while, I lost sight of it. I ran faster and faster trying to catch up with whoever it was. And then I ran full speed into the scarecrow. The straw filling did little to dull the impact with the wood post it was mounted on. I fell back onto my back. I grabbed my nose and could feel the palm of my hand immediately filled with warm blood. I sat up and felt dizzy. My head throbbed with each beat of my heart. \n\nWhen I was finally able to stand up. I looked up at the scarecrow. It was probably seven feet tall and then another two feet off the ground. I was dressed in blue overalls and a red flannel. The head was a burlap bag with thick red string stitched into a jagged mouth and big black buttons sewn on for eyes. Then it was topped with a straw hat stitched on with the same red string used for the mouth. This thing was intimidating to me at six foot two. Those crows must be terrified of it. I thought to myself. \n\nI pinched my nose to stop the bleeding and began to look around. I saw this scarecrow when we pulled in. there was no way I made it to the road already. I tried to hop up to see over the corn. I couldn’t see anything but more corn all the way to the horizon. \nAnd when my feet landed my head felt like it was going to pop. Thick blood began to flow more quickly from my nose. I pinched my nose and held my head back, facing the sky to slow the bleeding. Out of the corner of my eye that’s when I saw it. The scarecrow had turned to face me. I turned to face the oversized doll and figured that it must have been the wind again. \n\nFor a second we made eye contact. The big button eyes seemed to be looking right at me. I told myself I was being ridiculous. It was the wind that moved the head. It was just a bag filled with straw. It was the wind that was blowing the stalks and I imagined it was a figure running. It had even been the wind that was howling as it passed through the leaves. \n\nBut still, as I stared at it I knew it was staring back. The hair on my arms began to raise, making my arms tingle. My heart began to quicken. And then the scarecrow abruptly lifted its head back up and stared out over the field. \n\nI ran. I ran as fast as I could in the opposite direction. I stole short glances over my shoulder as I pushed through the corn. All I could see was a path of broken corn stalks behind me. Soon, I heard a rumbling noise ahead of me. A truck! I thought. I kept pushing on. My lungs began to burn with the effort.\n\nMy foot caught in a shallow irrigation ditch and sent me tumbling onto the dirt driveway. The driver of the truck locked up his brakes and skid passed me missing me by inches. I laid there in the dust for a moment. \n\nThe driver got out of his truck. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” He asked. His tone was harsh and angry. I stood up to face him. He was  in his mid forties with a big beard and an even bigger beer belly. \n\n“I’m sorry .I lost my footing.” I said. I looked back into the field expecting to see the monster coming out any second. The man followed my gaze into the field and then looked back at me. “You high, boy?” He asked seriously. \n\n“I… I was…” I stopped myself. Telling him I was being chased by a scarecrow would only reinforce his accusation. “I hit my head pretty hard.” I said, placing my hand back on my nose.\n\nHe nodded and then offered to give me a ride back up to the house. “I would have been here earlier if you knew how to give directions. There wasn’t no scarecrow at the road.” He said.\n\nWe pulled up to the house. And began unloading the boxes he came to deliver. “I’ll be back Friday to pick them up once they’re full. Your dad booked a storage shed on the other side of town. You have about two hundred square feet, so keep that in mind as you pack.” The man said. He stared into the field. “My daddy has a corn field in the next county. He didn’t do half as well as they did here. Actually, now that I think about it, I drove past this place last year. I remember they had a rough crop last year. Do you know what they did differently this year?” The driver asked. \n“No, I’m sorry. I don’t have any idea.” I answered. He nodded and spit. “Well, take care of yourself. I’ll see you on friday. With that, he left.\n\nI went inside and grabbed a clean shirt. I washed the blood off of my face and hands in the bathroom and changed. I tried to shake off the incident with the scarecrow. I must be more stressed out with the loss of my grandparents than I realized. \n\nI needed a distraction and began to pack up the office downstairs. I was putting papers in a trash bag when I came across a letter my grandmother had written:\n\nSon, \n\nI need some help with your father. The dementia is getting worse. The last two days he has been raving like a lunatic. This spring a man came by and offered us a scarecrow as a gift. He said it did wonders for his crop and wanted to pay it forward. Your father told him no at first, thinking the man was a swindler but he insisted he didn’t want anything in return. \n\nAnyway, your father is now convinced that the scarecrow is the reason we had such a great crop this year, but the scarecrow won’t let him harvest it. \n\nI have left you several voicemails about this and you haven’t called me back. So I thought I would write you. Please help. I am worried about your father.\n\n-Mom\n\nI put the letter down and sat in the office chair. I could dismiss my experience with the scarecrow as stress, or an overactive imagination. But my grandfather having similar worries about the same scarecrow? What are the odds? I thought to myself.\n\nI needed a cigarette. I went outside to the porch and lit one. I took a long drag  and then exhaled. A cool breeze blew by, bringing the windchimes to life. I turned around to look at them and see if one would be worth keeping. \n\nThat’s when I saw it. The scarecrow was now just twenty feet into the field. It hung on its post, staring at me. While I was trying to process this, it fell down. More like hopped down. Immediately the post went up and then disappeared into the field. \n\nIt can’t be alive. I thought to myself. Seconds later, the scarecrow came out of the corn. It began running across the lawn carrying the ten foot post like a trojan soldier running with a spear. The scarecrow launched the post. It sailed across the yard and missed me by a foot. It took down the windchimes and impaled the wall behind me. \n\nI turned to run inside but the post was now blocking my entrance. I hopped the rail on the porch and ran toward the old barn. I could hear the scarecrow running behind me. Gaining on me. This straw rustling under his overalls and flannel. \n\nOnce I was inside the barn I tried to close the door but it was stuck open from years of neglect. I grabbed the closest thing I could use as a weapon, a pitchfork. The scarecrow entered the room. It’s jagged mouth and button eyes now seemed much more menacing as it marched toward me. I rammed the pitchfork into its chest as hard as I could. It pierced deep into its body easily. But it seemed to have no effect. \n\nWith its left hand, or burlap mitten really, it grabbed my arm. The thing was impossibly strong. It used its right hand to pull the pitchfork out and then turn it toward me. I struggled uselessly against its grip. I desperately searched my pockets for something I could use as a weapon. \n\nI took my lighter out and flipped the top open. The flame caught almost instantly. In seconds, the scarecrow was fully engulfed. It let me go and fled into the field.\n\nThe field was burned in less than an hour. The fire department said it was overly dry because it wasn’t harvested on time. They didn’t have any interest in investigating the matter further. My father saw the post stuck in the wall when he picked me up. I knew he recognised it as the scarecrow’s post because he didn’t ask any questions about how it got thrown through the wall or how the field burned down.\n\nI know, on some level he suspects that the scarecrow killed his parents. I know on some level that he is grateful I killed it. But I know we will never discuss it because people would think we were crazy.\n"},"166":{"title":"Help me find this pasta!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fru3h4\/help_me_find_this_pasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"KarK1tty","selftext":"\nhi guys im sure you get these kinds of posts alot but ive just been tossing and turning in my sleep and a random memory keeps poping into my head of a fictional horror story, most likely a pasta i remember hearing about 5-6 years ago. but i cant find it so i thought maybe if i described what i remember here i could get some help finding it.\n\nokay so im gonna do my best to describe every detail i remember so its easier to find, also warning for things like vomit, blood and overall gross shit because that was a common theme in this story. okay so what i remember it being about was this guy who ether found, got given or baught this jar \/ vase \/ urn that he was told or found out would make him immortal, the catch was he had to spit and or vomit into it and then when he was ether injured or close to dying he had to drink everything in said vase until it was completely empty. now im pretty sure a section of the story was set in World War 2 and in this section he got very badly injured but i cant be exactly sure. now other bits of this that are a bit more fuzzy are the person he might have gotten this from was a traveling salesman i think? and im pretty sure the story started in the 1800s or earlier because of the world war 2 bit. and im almost 100% sure i heard this on some creepypasta podcast thing because around that time i almost exclusively listened to podcasts and horror stuff. \nill do my best to awswer any questions or try to remember more info about it.\n\nim sorry if this isn't or turns out to not be a pasta and im sorry if this is the wrong place for this but this is gonna bug me until i find out what it is, so if you have any ideas or theories id love to hear them because i really want to find this story. thank you guys in advance"},"167":{"title":"I tempted Satan ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frw8h3\/i_tempted_satan\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"You will definitely not know who I am and I am not mentioned in any of the holy books.

But what many don’t know is that there exists a dark, almost mythical episode that never aired—an episode some call “The Betrayal.”\n\n\n\nThe story begins with a VHS tape that surfaced on an obscure forum dedicated to lost media. A user claimed they had found it in a dusty old box in their grandfather’s attic, labeled simply, “Liberty’s Kids – Episode 14.” Intrigued, they uploaded it for others to see.\n\n\n\nThe episode started innocently enough, with James, Sarah, Moses, and Henri embarking on a new adventure in Philadelphia. But as the plot unfolded, it took a sinister turn. The children discovered a secret society operating in the shadows, manipulating the revolution to serve their own interests. The tone shifted, becoming darker and more unsettling.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a character who had never appeared in the show, a sinister figure cloaked in shadows, emerged. His voice was low and menacing, as he whispered promises of power and betrayal. The kids, curious and naïve, followed him deeper into the chaos. As they explored, the animation became increasingly distorted, with flickering images and haunting background music that seemed to echo their fear.\n\n\n\nViewers reported an unsettling feeling as they watched. The colors became muted, the characters’ faces twisted in ways that looked almost human but also unnervingly wrong. It felt as if the children were being lured into something far beyond their understanding.\n\n\n\nAs the episode progressed, the kids faced a moral dilemma. They were confronted with a choice: to join this shadowy society and gain power or to remain loyal to their cause. The children debated, but their discussion devolved into paranoia. Each character began to doubt the others, their friendships fracturing as accusations flew.\n\n\n\nThe final moments of the episode were a blur of chaos. The screen flashed rapidly between scenes of betrayal, bloodshed, and chaos in the streets of Philadelphia. The sinister figure laughed, his voice echoing in the background, drowning out the children’s pleas for help. The episode abruptly cut to black, leaving viewers in stunned silence.\n\n\n\nThose who watched it reported nightmares for weeks. The feeling of dread lingered long after the credits rolled. The user who uploaded the episode mysteriously vanished from the forum, their account erased as if they had never existed.\n\n\n\nTo this day, the episode remains lost, an urban legend among fans. Some say it was an attempt by the creators to address the darker aspects of revolution, while others believe it was a warning. A warning that sometimes, the fight for freedom can lead to betrayal—both from within and without. \n\n\n\nIf you come across a faded VHS labeled “Liberty’s Kids – Episode 14,” think twice before pressing play. Some histories are better left forgotten."},"173":{"title":"Time's Malevolent Gift","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frt70i\/times_malevolent_gift\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"InspectionFamiliar74","selftext":"The sun was just beginning to rise as I clipped the leashes onto the eager dogs, preparing for another early morning walk.\n\nI was leading a group of dogs on their walk, a job I had picked up on weekends to make ends meet. Being a student was tough enough, but working as a cashier at a small supermarket wasn't paying the bills. Rent, utilities, and groceries were stretching my finances thin, and walking dogs was my way to bridge the gap. It wasn't how I wanted to spend my weekends - I'd rather be resting or studying - but the money was necessary for my survival.\n\nMy dreams felt just out of reach.\n\nToday, I wasn't paying much attention to where we were going. I let the dogs lead the way, figuring they'd enjoy the freedom to explore. They pulled me into a street I had never been down before. The place had an eerie vibe, with old buildings and an unsettling emptiness.\n\nI could feel the weight of the world pressing down on me. Balancing school, work, and bills was a constant struggle. Walking dogs was supposed to be a simple task, but today it felt heavier than usual, as if the strange street we had wandered into mirrored my own sense of being lost.\n\nThe dogs seemed unaffected by the atmosphere, their tails wagging as they sniffed around.\n\nAs we walked further, my eyes landed on a shop whose windows showcased antique items. My curiosity got the best of me, and I walked closer to examine the collection of trinkets and curiosities. It contained an variety of vintage clocks, ornate jewelry boxes, and dusty old books with faded covers. A pretty brass telescope and a collection of porcelain dolls seemed staring at me with their cold, dead eyes.\n\nEach items seemed to tell a story.\n\nI decided it was a good time for a break. I tied the dogs' leashes to a nearby post and pulled out some bowls and a bottle of water from my backpack, pouring out fresh water for them. The dogs lapped it up eagerly, their tongues flicking out to catch every drop. \n\nThey needed a rest, and honestly, so did I.\n\nWith the dogs settled, I turned back to the antique store, feeling a pull of curiosity. When I was younger, I spent a few years living with my grandparents, surrounded by old furniture and keepsakes. Perhaps that's why I was always drawn to such places. \n\nStepping inside, a tiny bell jingled above the door, announcing my arrival.\n\nThe interior of the store was dimly lit, with shelves lined with all manner of antiquities. The air was thick with the scent of aged wood and musty paper. Dust motes floated lazily in the sunlight streaming through the grimy windows, casting a hazy glow over everything.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my fingers brushing against items that spoke of bygone eras. There were ornated pocket watches, their faces frozen in time, and tarnished silverware laid out on velvet cushions. A gramophone with a large brass horn sat in one corner, and I could almost hear the faint echo of old records it once played.\n\nOn one shelf, I found an assortment of glass bottles, each filled with mysterious, colorful liquids. Beside them were stacks of leather-bound journals, their spines cracked with age, hinting at stories long forgotten. The walls were decorated with framed sepia photographs, their subjects staring back with expressions lost to history.\n\nDespite the dust, the shop wasn't dirty. It had an odd charm, like stepping into a time capsule.\n\nOne shelf in particular hold my attention.\n\nIt was adorned with items that seemed connected to Native American culture. There were exquisite framed paintings, though they had clearly seen better days, depicting scenes of nature and wildlife. Each brushstroke captured the spirit and essence of the land, despite the wear and tear.\n\nHanging beside the paintings were ornate crafts made with feathers, beads, and objects found in nature. Dreamcatchers, their webs woven with meticulous care, dangled softly in the air.\n\nAmong these items were pieces of jewelry, delicate and beautiful. Bracelets and necklaces adorned with turquoise stones and silver charms gleamed softly in the dim light. One particular necklace hold my attention - a cord with a pendant that featured a sun and moon intertwined, reminiscent of the yin-yang symbol.\n\nI picked up the pendant, leaving the cord on its stand, and held it in my hand, examining it closely. There was something captivating about it, something that I couldn't quite explain. It felt like my brain was trying to register a memory or a sensation connected to this small piece of jewelry.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder, startling me out of my reverie. I turned quickly to see an old man standing behind me. «You like that piece, young man?» he asked, his voice soft yet slightly raspy.\n\nThe man was the shopkeeper, and his appearance was as peculiar as the items he sold. He was tall and thin, with a hunched posture that made him seem even older. His skin was deeply wrinkled, and his eyes were a piercing shade of blue, contrasting sharply with his silver hair that hung in wisps around his face. He wore an old, moth-eaten sweater that seemed to blend in with the shop's antique ambiance.\n\nHis manner of speaking was just as strange as his appearance, with a cadence that made each word sound deliberate and slightly eerie. «That pendant is quite special,» he continued, his eyes not leaving mine. «It's been in this shop for as long as I can remember. It calls to certain people.»\n\nI swallowed, still feeling the remnants of my initial shock. «It's beautiful,» I managed to say, my voice sounding weak in comparison to his.\n\nThe old man gave a cryptic smile, his eyes gleaming with a strange light. «Ah, that pendant,» he began, his voice taking on a rhythmic, almost hypnotic quality. «It's more than just a piece of jewelry. The Native Americans who crafted it believed it held great power. There are stories of those who wore it gaining a strategic mind, almost as if it granted them supernatural abilities. Warriors and leaders sought it for its rumored power.»\n\nHe paused, letting his words sink in. I wasn't sure what to think. It sounded like one of those stories street vendors tell, trying to sell a pen by claiming it once belonged to a famous historical figure, yet having a suitcase full of identical pens.\n\n«Many have tried to possess it,» he continued, his gaze unwavering. «Some say the pendant bestows upon its wearer a gift - a keen sense for strategy, almost otherworldly in its precision. Perhaps it is just a myth, or perhaps it is something more.»\n\nI chuckled nervously, unsure whether to believe his tale. «That's quite a story,» I said, trying to keep my skepticism from showing too much. Despite the odd story, I was still drawn to the pendant. There was something about it that I couldn't shake.\n\n«How much is it?» I asked, deciding to ignore the peculiar narrative and focus on the object itself.\n\nThe old man pointed to a small sign behind the counter and asked, «Can't you read?»\n\n***\n\nAs I stepped out of the shop, the pendant now safely in my possession, I noticed a peculiar sight - the dogs were staring at me intently, unmoving.\n\nThe stillness felt unnatural, as if they knew something I didn't.\n\nI approached them cautiously, untying their leashes from the post. «Alright, where do you want to go?» I asked with a smile, trying to shake off the uneasy feeling their stare had left me with. The dogs perked up immediately, tails wagging enthusiastically as if they had been waiting for my cue.\n\n«Let's go, everyone,» I called out cheerfully, hoping to lift my spirits. The dogs bounded forward, exploring the street with renewed energy. Yet, as I glanced back, I noticed the golden retriever still watching me intently.\n\n«Come on, buddy,» I encouraged the golden retriever, patting my thigh invitingly. Surprisingly, the dog hesitated for a moment, as if deliberating, before finally trotting over to join the rest of the pack. I chuckled softly to myself, attributing the strange moment to my own imagination.\n\nWe continued our walk down the unfamiliar street, the dogs leading the way with their curious noses and playful antics. The strange vibe of the street seemed to fade into the background as I focused on enjoying the afternoon with my furry buddies.\n\n***\n\nIt was Monday night, and I was in a foul mood. I had just returned from college, so exhausted that I went straight to bed without even bothering to shower or change out of my clothes.\n\nIt all started earlier at my job as a cashier. \n\nThe supermarket checkout line was unusually long, and all the electronic services seemed to have decided to be slower than usual today, much to my frustration. \n\nOne impatient customer in particular began loudly complaining about the delay, directing verbal attacks at me. Already stressed from the sluggish register, I snapped back at the insult, earning a stern reprimand from my boss. He made it clear that he didn't need an employee who mistreated customers, with an implied threat of termination.\n\nFearful of losing my job, I quickly apologized, explaining how stressed I was, though it barely felt like an excuse. With upcoming exams at college, the pressure of balancing studies, rent, and groceries, on top of potentially losing my job, weighed heavily on my mind. My boss wasn't entirely forgiving, but at least he didn't fire me on the spot.\n\nDespite his stern warning, I was grateful to still have a job, even though the fear of losing it lingered in my mind.\n\nLater that evening, I found myself at college, trying to focus on my studies despite the events of the day weighing heavily on me. During a particularly intense lecture, my phone started buzzing repeatedly, even though I had put it on silent mode. It vibrated insistently until the professor called me out, his tone more disappointed than angry.\n\n«Mr. Thompson, please step outside and take care of that,» he said, gesturing towards the door. \n\nThe eyes of my classmates followed me as I hurried out, feeling a wave of embarrassment and humiliation wash over me.\n\nOnce outside the classroom, I checked my phone. It was my girlfriend calling repeatedly. I took a deep breath and answered.\n\n«Hey, what's going on?» I asked, trying to keep my voice calm despite the tension.\n\nHer voice was sharp with frustration. «Don't 'hey' me. Where the heck have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day!» She sounded hurt and angry.\n\n«I'm sorry, I've had a really tough day,» I replied, attempting to justify myself. «Work was chaotic, and then I had this incident with my boss. I'm really not in the mood for accusations right now.»\n\nShe scoffed. «Yeah, right. \"Incident with your boss.\" Like I can't read between the lines.\nYou're probably out with some chick, aren't you? Do you think I'm stupid?»\n\n«No, no, it's not like that at all,» I insisted, feeling frustration rising within me. «I've been swamped with work and school. I haven't had a chance to breathe, let alone cheat on you!»\n\nHer voice softened slightly, but the skepticism remained. «I don't know, Jake. It just feels like you're never there for me anymore. Maybe we need to take a break.»\n\nMy heart sank. «Wait, what? A break? Come on, can't we talk about this?»\n\nShe sighed heavily. «I don't know if there's anything left to talk about. You're always so disorganized and lazy when it comes to us. I need someone who can prioritize me.»\n\nI felt a lump in my throat, struggling to find the right words to salvage the situation. «Please, don't do this. I'm sorry if I've been distant. I'll try harder, I promise.»\n\nThere was a long pause before she finally spoke again, her voice softer now. «I don't know, Jake. I need time to think. I'll call you later.»\n\nThe call ended, leaving me feeling utterly defeated. The weight of my responsibilities seemed heavier than ever.\n\nI tossed and turned in my bed, eventually lying on my back and reaching for the pendant hanging around my neck. I held it in my hand, tracing its detailed lines with my finger before finally succumbing to a deep sleep.\n\nThe next morning, my phone's alarm jolted me awake. \n\nI groggily reached out to silence the annoying sound, only to freeze in panic as I realized I wasn't wearing the same clothes I had gone to bed in. \n\nDid I change before sleeping? \n\nIt seemed unlikely. I distinctly remembered being too exhausted to bother changing. Yet, here I was, dressed in fresh clothes that I couldn't account for.\n\nShaking off the odd feeling, I pushed the unsettling thought to the back of my mind and hurried to start my day. \n\nOn my way to work, however, an overwhelming sense of déjà vu washed over me. The people passing by on the sidewalk, the cars honking in traffic.\n\nIt all felt like a repeat of yesterday. \n\nAt first, I brushed it off as mere coincidence, but as one coincidence piled onto another, I couldn't ignore the strange sensation gnawing at me.\n\nArriving at work, I found myself caught in the same routine as the previous day. The checkout line was long again, the electronic systems slower than usual. A familiar sense of frustration began to simmer within me, mirroring yesterday's tense atmosphere.\n\nSuddenly, a man's voice boomed out loud, complaining about the delay and launching into an attack. «What's taking so long? This is ridiculous! Is there a fucking slug as a cashier or something?!»\n\nHis words hit me as recognition dawned\n\nThe man's face and voice were unmistakable. I couldn't explain how or why, but it dawned on me - I was reliving yesterday's events. And no one seemed to find it odd. \n\nWas this happening only to me?\n\nWith a growing sense of unease, I resisted the urge to respond, instead keeping my focus steady. I wasn't sure if altering the future was wise or even possible. As my shift finally ended and I left the supermarket, my boss approached me with a surprising comment.\n\n«What a day, huh?» he remarked, his tone lighter than I expected. He commended me for keeping my cool and doing a good job despite the challenges. I nodded, a mixture of relief and confusion swirling inside me. \n\nHad I just experienced a glitch in time, or was I losing my grip on reality?\n\nBoarding the bus to college, I remembered my girlfriend and pulled out my phone. As I glanced at the screen, I noticed \"Monday\" displayed prominently. \n\nHow had I not noticed the date earlier? \n\nIt added another layer of confusion to an already bewildering day. \n\nHad I somehow lost track of time, or was this part of the strange repetition I seemed trapped in?\n\nI scrolled through my notifications to find several missed calls and messages from my girlfriend. Guilt washed over me as I realized how preoccupied I had been with the bizarre events unfolding around me. \n\nQuickly, I typed out a message to her, trying to sound reassuring despite my own uncertainty.\n\n\"Hey, sorry for not answering earlier. I'm really busy with classes right now. I'll keep my phone off during lectures. I'll call you as soon as I get back home this evening. Hang in there.\"\n\nSending the message, I hoped it would appease her concerns, though I knew deep down it wouldn't erase the underlying issues between us. \n\nArriving at college, I tried to focus on my studies, seeking solace in the routine of lectures and assignments  The day dragged on, and by the time I returned to my apartment, I felt utterly drained. \n\nWith a heavy sigh, I pulled out my phone and turned it on, bracing myself for the inevitable notifications. \n\nSure enough, there were numerous missed calls and messages from my girlfriend. With a sense of resignation, I dialed her number.\n\nAfter a few rings, she picked up. «Where the fuck have you been? Why haven't you been answering? Are you with someone else?» Her voice was a mix of anger and desperation, clearly indicating she'd been crying for hours.\n\nI sighed deeply, trying to keep my cool. «I've been at college, studying. I told you I was busy. Why do you always jump to the worst conclusions?»\n\n«Don't lie to me! I know you're cheating on me! You never have time for me anymore!» she screamed, her voice breaking.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. \n\nThe stress of my job, my studies, and her constant accusations were pushing me to a breaking point. \n\n«I'm not cheating on you, dammit! I'm just trying to keep up with everything. Why is it so hard for you to understand this?!» I shouted back, surprising even myself with the intensity of my anger.\n\nI'm a person who usually avoids confrontation, but I couldn't take this anymore.\n\nShe went silent for a moment, then her voice turned cold. «If you don't care enough to make time for me, then maybe we should just end this.»\n\nHer threat, which usually filled me with dread, now felt like a release. I'd had a lot of time to think during my repetitive day, reflecting on our relationship. I realized how unhappy I'd been, constantly bending over backward to keep her satisfied, enduring her accusations and threats. \n\nIt wasn't fair to either of us.\n\n«Yeah, maybe we should,» I said, my voice surprisingly steady. «I'm tired of always feeling like I'm not enough for you. We should break up.»\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end. When she finally spoke, her voice was small, almost disbelieving. «Fine. If that's what you want!.»\n\nI quickly recognized the guilt trap but didn't take the bait. If she wants to make me the bad guy, so be it.\n\nBetter alone than in bad company.\n\nI hung up on her and immediately blocked her on everything. Exhausted, I collapsed onto the bed without changing my clothes. I grabbed the pendant around my neck, wondering if this strange piece of jewelry with the sun and moon design had anything to do with the bizarre events. \n\nWhat have that old creepy-looking shopkeeper said?\n\nThat this pendant gave powers... of something related to strategy? \n\nI don't even think he even knew what he was talking about. He probably didn't even know if it gave the user powers or not. That little story might help add some charm to the merchandise or something.\n\nClosing my eyes, I fell into a fitful sleep, uncertain of what tomorrow would bring.\n\nWith a severe case of uthceare kicking in, the first thing I did when I woke up wasn't  to turn off my phone's alarm but to check my clothes. To my relief, I was still wearing the same clothes I had fallen asleep in. \n\nIt felt strange to think of yesterday as \"yesterday,\" given that it was a repetition of my yesterday. And it was even stranger that this phenomenon had apparently only happened to me.\n\nTo be absolutely sure I wasn't repeating the same day again, I grabbed my phone and felt a wave of relief wash over me as I saw \"Tuesday\" on the phone screen.\n\nI continued my day normally - work, college, everything seemed unusually calm. That was until a call from an unknown number ruined it all. \n\nIt was my ex, calling from a different number. \n\nShe was clearly drunk, her speech slurred and incoherent. One moment she was cursing me, telling me how much time she wasted on me, and the next she was crying. Eventually, I hung up and decided to take a shower before bed.\n\nHowever, I remembered the pendant I had bought from that strange shop. I got up again and put it around my neck, wanting to test something. \n\nWhen I woke up, I wasn't wearing the same clothes I had gone to bed in. I quickly grabbed my phone and saw \"Tuesday\" on the screen. \n\nI was reliving the same day again.\n\nI followed my routine, and everything happened exactly the same way - at work, at college. With this advantage, I made sure to avoid some mistakes I had made the previous \"yesterday\". When I returned to my apartment, my phone rang. Already knowing it would be my drunken ex calling from another number, I quickly blocked it and went to watch TV.\n\nIf felt liberating to escape the drama and simply relax.\n\nAs I sat on the couch, a sense of control washed over me. The bizarre experience of reliving the same day provided me with a unique opportunity. I could refine my actions, correct my mistakes, and navigate my life with an uncanny foreknowledge. Now, I was beginning to understand why this pendant granted its wearer \"strategic\" powers.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I grabbed my phone to check the date, and there it was: \"Wednesday.\"\n\nApparently, I could only repeat the yesterday once. \n\nOne shot to get things right.\n\nI decided to test the power of this pendant, so I went about my routine normally. That night, I went to sleep without the pendant to see if these strange events were connected to it. When I woke up and checked my phone, it read \"Thursday\". I quickly understood how the pendant worked.\n\nFrom then on, I slept with the pendant every night, using my newfound ability to hack life, avoiding mistakes and embarrassing moments. My boss began to praise me for this \"innate\" ability to handle rude customers and deal with unexpected situations. \n\nIf only he knew.\n\nBut that was my secret and mine alone.\n\nOnce, some robbers attempted to hold up the supermarket. My boss and the other employees were terrified. I had to pretend to be scared too, but once I got back to my apartment, I couldn't stop smiling as I planned how to prevent this event when today repeated itself tomorrow. I knew the exact time the robbers would strike, so it was easy to excuse myself to the bathroom and call the police just before the robbery was supposed to happen.\n\nIt was like I was invincible.\n\nThis ability to relive yesterday once more also greatly helped with my studies. Being able to attend the same class twice was a huge advantage, not to mention being able to relax during the weekend twice as much.\n\nWhen the most dreaded day for every student arrived - exam day - I didn't need to feel nervous. I didn't panic when I encountered questions I couldn't answer. I just memorized as many questions as I could, looked up the answers, and slept with the pendant around my neck to relive the day and retake the exam, this time knowing how to answer the previously questions I didn't know how to answer or I was in doubt.\n\nI wondered to myself what else I could do with this ability to relive the day once more, and then new ideas started to emerge. \n\nI had always been someone who had to work hard and sweat to have the things I needed, always on the verge of losing everything, counting coins at the end of the month. So I decided to be selfish and greedy. Now that I had a huge advantage in my hands - or rather, around my neck - I was going to grab this advantage and make the most of it.\n\nBeyond just avoiding the mistakes made during the day, I began to enjoy life the way I always wanted. \n\nI went to the cinema, bowling alleys, karaoke bars, and restaurants. I spent money I didn't have, but I wasn't worried because all I had to do was sleep with the pendant to relive the day again and avoid spending anything, keeping my money intact.\n\nFor a moment, guilt washed over me as I questioned whether I should be taking advantage of this pendant. \n\nWas it wrong to indulge myself while others struggled? \n\nBut then I reminded myself that everyone enjoyed life in their own way, and I wasn't hurting anyone in the process. After all, I was simply seizing an opportunity that had been gifted to me, making the most of what I had.\n\nThis super-power turned every moment into strategic advantage.\n\nI can be selfish. And that's okay.\n\nI started using this ability to commit small thefts too. I mentally noted when my boss and colleagues were distracted, and when the day repeated, I took advantage of those exact moments to steal some products from the supermarket. \n\nI had worked there long enough to know the blind spots of the cameras. And I also knew that this supermarket's cash flow was rather sloppy.\n\nI also started applying the same trick at college. The classrooms didn't have cameras, making it easier for me to slip my hand into someone's backpack when I knew the perfect moment no one would notice.\n\nI knew what I was doing was wrong, so I always made sure it was just small things, and that it didn't raise too much suspicion.\n\nDuring a break at college, I went into the men's restroom with a triumphant smile. I had managed to steal some coins from a classmate's bag when I knew the exact moment was right, just enough to buy a can of soda from the vending machine. \n\nI tossed the empty can in the trash and then splashed water on my face. When I looked in the mirror again, I was startled to see that it wasn't just my reflection staring back at me but also a deer. I quickly turned around but saw nothing. I was alone in the restroom. \n\nI turned back to the mirror, and everything seemed normal again. Shaking off the unsettling vision, I headed back to my apartment. After taking a long shower and eating some instant noodles I had swiped from work, I crashed into bed with the pendant featuring the sun and moon still around my neck. \n\nI knew wearing it tonight was pointless, the day could only be repeated once. What happened today was set in stone. But the pendant had become a part of me now, a strange new comfort.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up feeling off. \n\nMy sleep had been disturbed by bizarre dreams of Native Americans and a haunting deer with dark, piercing eyes and metallic antlers. No matter where I ran in the dream, the deer always found me. \n\nBrushing off the unease, I decided to take the day for myself. I sent my boss a half-baked excuse for why I couldn't come to work and skipped college entirely. I splurged on expensive clothes, rented a luxury car, dined at a high-end Japanese restaurant, visited a strip club, and bought premium alcohol, reveling in the freedom and excess as if it were my last day on Earth. Later that night, I returned to my apartment, the pendant still around my neck, and fell asleep.\n\nThe alarm blared, and I silenced it with a groggy swipe. \n\nChecking my phone, I saw the date had reset - Tuesday again. \n\nSatisfied, I knew it was time to undo the extravagant day I had just lived. Now it was back to my mundane routine, avoiding all the reckless spending and indulgence.\n\nWork was tediously slow. \n\nMinutes felt like hours as I went through the motions. Just as my shift was about to end, my boss asked for help with some heavy boxes. If the pendant allowed me to relive the day multiple times, I would have told him off and left. But knowing its limits, I forced myself to be the diligent, hardworking employee he expected.\n\nBecause of this, I missed my usual bus and had to walk to college. Turning a corner, I was startled by an elderly woman who seemed to appear out of nowhere. \n\nShe had a deeply lined face, a tattered cloak, and numerous handmade trinkets and feathers woven into her gray hair. Her grip was surprisingly strong as she seized my arm, stopping me in my tracks. The street around us was eerily empty.\n\nShe spoke in a raspy voice, her eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that made me uneasy. «You must be careful,» she warned.\n\nI yanked my arm free, glaring at her. «Get away from me, you crazy woman!»\n\nIgnoring my insult, she continued in a strange, enigmatic tone. «The forces that forged this gift, shall chastise those who corrupt its essence.»\n\n«Just leave me alone!» I shouted, stepping backward. I stumbled over the curb but managed to keep my balance. When I looked back, the old woman had vanished without a trace.\n\nShaken, I hurried to college, her cryptic words echoing in my mind. The rest of the day felt surreal, and by the time I got home, I was more exhausted than ever.\n\nI lay on my bed, scrolling through my phone, when an ad for a betting site hold my attention. \n\nA smile crept across my face. \n\nI had never dared to gamble before; as someone who had always been scraping by, I kept my distance from such things, afraid of losing everything. But now, with this pendant around my neck, I had nothing to fear.\n\nThe next few days were the best of my life. \n\nI had a blast and made a fortune using the advantage of reliving the day once more. I found a few betting sites that the internet claimed were reliable and placed several sports bets. I didn't care if I lost and nearly emptied my bank account; I just needed to sleep to relive the day and bet on the team I \"predicted\" would win. I also discovered other ways to make money using the pendant's advantage, like day trading and stocks. I had never had so much money in my life and no longer needed to look for odd jobs, like dog walking.\n\nI have the word at my fingertips.\n\nAs I walked down the college hallway, carrying my backpack over one shoulder and checking the betting site on my phone, I reflected a bit on my life. Since childhood, I had never really been able to be a child. The worry about not having enough money to pay bills and buy necessities always weighed on my shoulders. I had worked hard my entire life, but it never seemed to be enough. Now, with this mysterious pendant, I could prosper on a much easier path.\n\nI was already starting to reconsider working at the supermarket and going to college.\n\nJust as I had expected, the team I bet on won, and my money tripled. In just a few hours, I earned far more than I did working a month at that dead-end supermarket.\n\nI pocketed my phone with a victorious smile but suddenly froze when I saw the scene before me. \n\nAt the end of the hallway stood a deer, larger than usual, with dark eyes and metallic antlers adorned with a feather. It walked gracefully among the gathering.\n\nThe students passed by the enormous creature, completely ignoring it. It was as if no one else could see it. In fact, they probably couldn't; it was only visible to me. \n\nThe creature's hooves clacked against the floor, echoing through the corridor. The deer stopped and fixed its gaze on me. A wave of terror surged through my body. I turned on my heel and ran, weaving through confused peoples.\n\nI made it back to my apartment in record time. The familiar comfort of my safe haven provided some solace, but it wasn't enough. I tried to distract myself by cleaning, watching TV, and taking a shower, but nothing could erase the image of that deer in the hallway.\n\nWhat was that deer?\n\nAm I hallucinating?\n\nI tried to ignore the incident, convincing myself it was a one-time occurrence. Days passed, and I hoped it was the end of it. But soon, the sound of hooves began to follow me. Just like in my dreams, no matter where I went, I couldn't escape the deer. From time to time, I would see its reflection in any reflective surface, and occasionally, I would catch a glimpse of the massive creature passing by. As in the college hallway, the deer was visible only to me.\n\nWhile I was arranging some canned goods on a shelf in one of the supermarket aisles, my blood ran cold at the familiar sound of hooves echoing. \n\nI could see through the shelf to the other side of the aisle, and there it was. The deer walked slowly on the other side. This was the closest it had ever been. Out of the blue, a hand landed on my shoulder, startling me. It was my coworker, Mike.\n\n«Hey, you okay?» Mike asked, his brow furrowed with concern.\n\n«Yeah, I'm fine,» I replied quickly, forcing a smile.\n\n«You sure? You look like you've seen a ghost,» he said, not entirely convinced.\n\n«I just... I'm not feeling well,» I lied, hoping he would buy it.\n\nMike studied me for a moment, then nodded. «Alright, take it easy.»\n\nHe walked away, and I peered through the shelf again, but the deer was nowhere to he found.\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half expecting to see those dark eyes and metallic antlers staring back at me.\n\nI climbed the stairs to my apartment, exhausted from work and unable to concentrate in class with everything that was happening. The weight of the day pressed heavily on my shoulders, and all I wanted was the sanctuary of my own space.\n\nAs I reached into my pocket for my keys and approached my door, I heard the unmistakable sound of hooves scraping the ground behind me. My heart drummed as I turned slowly, dread filling me. There it was - the creature. The deer scratched the ground a few more times with its hooves before lowering its head and aiming its formidable antlers at me.\n\nThe deer let out a roar and charged. \n\nHow I managed to get the key into the lock, turn it, and slip inside my apartment before the deer reached me is still a mystery. \n\nI leaned against the door, using all my strength to keep the creature out. Its razor-sharp antlers pierced through the door, nearly impaling me. The deer rammed the door repeatedly, each impact reverberating through the wood and into my bones, accompanied by the guttural sounds of an enraged animal.\n\nEventually, everything went silent. \n\nNo more sounds of hooves or angry bellows. \n\nAfter almost an hour of leaning against the door, I cautiously peeked through the holes the deer's antlers had punched into the door. Only an empty corridor stared back at me.\n\nI slumped to the floor, my body shaking with exhaustion and fear. \n\nWhat was happening to me? \n\nWhy was this deer haunting me?\n\nThe following morning, my landlord, visibly irritated, came to speak with me. He had received complaints from neighbors about noise late at night and was even more incensed upon seeing the holes in my apartment door. He demanded that I pay for the damages, which I quickly agreed to. It was easier to comply than to try explaining that a demonic deer with metallic antlers, visible only to me, had tried to kill me the previous night.\n\nI went through my day as usual - working at the supermarket and then attending classes at college. All the while, I kept glancing over my shoulder, making sure the hellish deer wasn't following me. The constant anxiety wore me down, but I managed to get through my responsibilities without incident.\n\nWhen I returned to my apartment that evening, I made a decision. I would sleep without the pendant tonight. I didn't want to relive this stressful day and endure another confrontation with the landlord.\n\n***\n\nToday was a holiday, meaning no work and no classes. The deer seemed to have finally ceased its pursuit. I hadn't seen it for some time.\n\nIt was night, and I was walking down the street, phone in hand, watching my money grow. Day trading had proven to be much faster and more lucrative than sports betting and buying stocks. With the pendant allowing me to relive the holiday once more, I knew the exact moments the market would rise or fall, making precise decisions and earning substantial profits.\n\nAfter a series of successful trades, one after the other, I invested more and more money. I was determined to quit my job and drop out of college. I didn't need them anymore. I envisioned building an empire, with people working for me while I never had to come home so exhausted that I could barely change clothes, let alone worry about my future.\n\nSuccess was within my grasp, and that's not something many people can say.\n\nI paused my nightly walk to sit on the curb, still fixated on my phone. A stray dog wandered by and then began barking in a specific direction.\n\nUnexpectedly, the ordinary barking turned into fierce, guttural growls, holding my attention. The dog's fur stood on end as it bared its teeth at something hidden in the dense vegetation behind me.\n\nAlarmed, I stood up from the curb and pocketed my phone. My blood ran cold as I heard the sounds I wished never to hear again - the clattering of hooves approaching. The once-brave dog whimpered and ran away, tail between its legs.\n\nThe dim streetlight revealed the massive deer emerging from the bushes, the feather tied to its antler swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nNo, no... not again. Not again. Not again!\n\nIf a dog could see that, then it meant I wasn't going crazy.\n\nI bolted down the deserted street, screaming for help, the hoofbeats echoing behind me. Desperate, I crawled under a nearby parked van, the only place I could find that seemed remotely safe.\n\nThe deer rammed the van, shattering glass with a loud crash. It snorted angrily, attacking the vehicle from all sides. My heart drummed incessantly against the hard asphalt as I watched its legs pacing around the van, occasionally charging at it with its antlers or front hooves.\n\nThen I remembered my phone. I fumbled for it, intending to call the police. Just as I was about to dial, an angry voice rang out. «What happened to my car?!» yelled a man, his voice full of outrage.\n\n«What?» I whispered to myself. \n\nI looked around, but the deer was gone, just like in the supermarket aisle.\n\nI crawled out from under the van. The angry man approached me, demanding to know what had happened, what those marks on his car were. Unable to take any more, I run. \n\nThe man shouted for me to wait, but I ignored him.\n\nBreathless, I ran through the streets, not knowing where to go. My mind was a riotous storm of fear and confusion. I found myself back at my apartment, panting and drenched in sweat. I locked the door behind me and collapsed onto the floor, the events of the night replaying in my mind.\n\nI don't remember when I fell asleep, but once again, I dreamed of the deer relentlessly chasing me. This time, however, it was different. I was sprinting through dense vegetation, the furious clatter of the deer's hooves echoing ominously behind me. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a Native American tent, surrounded by a group of indigenous people gathered around a fire.\n\nOne of them, an older woman, looked at me and approached. She wore a necklace with a pendant of the sun and moon. «You must be careful,» she said. «The forces that forged this gift, shall chastise those who corrupt its essence.» I quickly recognized her as the same old woman who had grabbed my arm.\n\nI woke up drenched in a cold sweat, leaping out of bed and tossing the covers aside. My fingers found the pendant around my neck, and with a resolute tug, I tore it off.\n\nThe morning air was chilly, and the sky was a blanket of gray clouds. \n\nThe dock lay deserted. I walked to its edge and gazed at the water. Taking the necklace from my coat pocket, I gave it one final look before throwing it into the sea.\n\nFor a few moments, I stood there, absorbing the peaceful scenery. As I turned to leave, my heart nearly stopped - I saw the deer standing at the dock's entrance.\n\nI was trapped; if the deer decided to charge, I had nowhere to run. But to my surprise, the deer walked calmly to the edge of the dock and leapt into the water. \n\nThere was no sound of a splash. \n\nI approached the spot where it had jumped, but saw nothing but the calm sea.\n\nI stood there, perplexed, staring at the water, trying to understand what had happened. Everything was calm, as if the deer had never existed. The cold wind blew, bringing with it a sense of relief and closure.\n\nWith a deep sigh, I stepped away from the railing and began walking back home. For the first time in weeks, I felt light, free from the fear that had haunted me. \n\nThe deer seemed to have vanished, taking with it all the terror it had brought."},"174":{"title":"Welcome back.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frrjvm\/welcome_back\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"VladanArsenijevic","selftext":"The evening started just like any other, with nothing seemingly different from the monotonous routine of my daily life. I brushed my teeth with the same worn-out toothbrush I hadn’t replaced in years. After rinsing my mouth with cold water, I headed to my room through the long, dark hallways of my grandfather’s house. The creaking of the floorboards was nothing unusual, but I still tried not to wake up my old, tired granddad.\n\nThe room where I spent most of my time was nothing special. In the middle, against the left wall, was a wooden bed. My feet touched the edge every time I lay down. A heavy, dark oak desk, accompanied by a chair carved with floral patterns at the top of the backrest, stood in the upper-left corner, between the bed and the window. The curtains had long been removed from the scratched and battered old window. Curtains, for some irrational reason, always made me uneasy.\n\nAfter putting my glasses on the desk, I grabbed my checkered pajamas from the wardrobe beside the bed, changed into them, and laid down to sleep. I rarely had dreams, and when I did, they were fragmented, hopeless bits of boyish imagination or continuations of the day's events. I usually couldn’t remember much of them after waking up.\n\nUnexpectedly, I fell into a deep sleep, the kind that makes you feel as though you've blinked and suddenly woken up. But something wasn’t right. I couldn’t see anything without my glasses. I reached for the spot where I instinctively knew they should be, but there was nothing—my hand passed through empty air.\n\nI stood up, feeling uneasy, and jumped out of bed onto the floor. Instantly, I wished I hadn’t. Between my toes I felt some kind of warm, sticky sand, which clung to me like it wanted to turn me into a lifeless prop in some twisted play. I noticed something else, something that took my mind off of the weird surface I was standing on. My vision... cleared? I hadn’t seen this clearly since I was a child, before the accident that left my grandfather the only family I had.\n\nAs my eyes adjusted to this new environment, I grew no less disturbed. A warped landscape stretched before me, filled with that sticky substance, which I now realized wasn’t sand. A sickly green light illuminated the grotesque scene before me, casting long shadows from the finger-like protrusions that towered beyond my line of sight. I wasn’t the panicking type, but this was beyond anything I could have imagined in my wildest nightmares.\n\nMy heart raced, threatening to burst from my chest and leave me behind. That’s my biggest fear—being left alone, again.\n\nThe ground trembled, and with it came a horrible screech, a sound unlike anything I had ever heard before. I felt like I was losing my mind. I crouched down, gripping my head, hoping to block out the noise, but it only grew louder, as though it was living inside me. It became so unbearable that my body started to convulse and twist. Desperate, I began hitting my head, thinking it was the only way to stop the torment. It didn’t work.\n\nJust when I thought my skull would explode from the pressure, everything went silent. Dead silent. I let out a tear, thinking that perhaps this nightmare was finally over. How naive I was.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a whisper. I couldn’t make out the words, but I knew something tried to talk to me. The whisper grew into something far greater than I could comprehend, filling the air, the grotesque green light stabbing into my body like a thousand needles. I curled into a ball, trying to protect my eyes and ears, but this force wasn’t letting up. As it sliced through my flesh without mercy, I desperately tried to understand anything from the whispers, but it was futile. I felt like I was trapped in a cage underwater, powerless to stop my inevitable demise.\n\nTo my relief, the screeching stopped, just as suddenly as it had begun. I barely had time to catch my breath before a shadowy figure appeared before me, its shape concealed beneath a tattered black cloak. I stared at it without blinking, afraid to lose sight of it. A tiny flicker of optimism inside me hoped that this being was here to help me, to save me.\n\nOnce again, I was naive.\n\nIt laughed, a deep, harsh, and eerie laugh that sent a shiver down every inch of my body. For a few seconds, there was silence, and I stood frozen in place. It spoke. The words were brief and clearly malevolent, but I only understood one: “Run!”\n\nThe substance binding my feet to the ground released its grip, giving me a chance to flee, confirming the meaning of the word that the creature had spoken. Another mistake. I should have known it wouldn’t be that easy.\n\nThe first step filled me with hope, but the second snatched it away just as quickly. That disgusting sludge latched onto me again, this time tearing chunks of skin from my bare feet as I ran harder than I ever had in my life. The pain was beyond words, unlike anything I had ever experienced. It urged me to stop and give up, but the mere thought of what was behind me kept me moving forward.\n\nAs I ran, I watched parts of my body get left behind, my only chance of escape fading with them. When it became impossible to run, I fell to my hands and began to crawl. Again, the same torment. I wanted to stop, to give up; it would have been easier than what was happening to me, but I couldn’t. The creature’s words had taken over my body, and despite my screams and cries, I kept going until there was nothing left of me to move. With my legs gone and my arms torn off by this wretched place, I collapsed face-first into the slime, unable to move.\n\nThis wasn’t the end of my suffering, though. I heard heavy footsteps, but I couldn’t see them, which only heightened my dread. What I feared most quickly pulled me out of the sticky substance. With one final scream, which peeled away the skin from my face and much of my body, I looked up at it, sobbing. Beneath that cursed hood was nothing. No face. Nothing, except the stench of a rotting corpse.\n\nThe screeching returned, this time like the incessant whine of a broken machine. I was desperate. I begged for it all to end, for the creature to take my life. It smiled again, that same eerie, haunting smile. Its laugh, combined with the screeching, ruptured my eardrums, and blood began pouring from my ears. It spoke words that seemed to echo inside my mind; I didn’t need to interpret them: “Welcome back.”\n\nA green light flashed in an explosion, damaging my eyes. Everything went blurry again. I shut them tightly, praying this wasn’t real. The screeching stopped, and I opened my eyes again.\n\nI saw a round white light above my head and people in white coats surrounding me.\n\n“Am I dead?” I asked them.\n\n“You were, but thankfully we managed to bring you back,” an older man said, standing by my bed while removing his gloves.\n\nThe doctors told me I was the sole survivor of a car crash caused by my drunk father.\n\n“Impossible... Is this déjà vu?” I thought in my head.\n\nHadn’t this already happened? I didn’t dare voice my thoughts out loud, fearing they’d keep me in the hospital. A strange discomfort settled in my chest, but my attention was diverted by the nurse who informed me I had a visitor.\n\nThe door opened, and there stood my grandfather.

Panic gripped me as I realized I was in a dark, damp room surrounded by other children, all of us bound and helpless.  \n  \nMemories of the night before flooded back to me in fragments; the hooded figures surrounding my bed, the sharp pain as they injected me with something that made me feel weak and disoriented. I remembered being dragged out of my house, screaming for help that never came.  \n  \nI looked around at the other kids, some crying, some staring blankly at the walls. We were all in our pajamas, a stark reminder of how vulnerable and innocent we were.  \n  \nI strained against my restraints, trying to find any way to escape. The room we were in was small, with no windows and only one door. I could hear muffled voices outside, the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway.  \n  \nI whispered to the boy next to me, asking if he knew where we were. He shook his head, tears streaming down his face.  \n  \n“We’re in a cult,” he said. “They’re going to sacrifice us to gain eternal youth.”  My blood ran cold at his words. Sacrifice? Eternal youth? It sounded like something out of a horror movie, something I never thought could happen in real life.  \n  \nBut as I looked around at the other kids, their faces full of fear and confusion, I knew it was all too real.  \n  \nI closed my eyes, trying to think of a plan, a way to escape before it was too late. But the more I thought about it, the more hopeless it seemed.  \n  \nJust then, the door to the room creaked open, and in walked a tall figure in a hooded cloak. My heart raced as I recognized him as the leader of the cult, the one who had orchestrated our abduction.  \n  \nHe smiled as he looked around at us, his eyes shining with a sickening mix of greed and madness.  \n  \n“Welcome, my young friends,” he said, his voice silky smooth. “You have been chosen for a great honor, a sacrifice that will bring us eternal youth and power.  \n  \n”I shuddered at his words, knowing what he meant by sacrifice. I looked at the other kids, seeing the same fear and resignation in their eyes.  \n  \nBut as the cult leader began to walk towards me, something inside me snapped. I was not going to go down without a fight.  \n  \nWith a sudden burst of strength, I lunged forward, my restraints snapping as I tackled the cult leader to the ground. I could hear the other kids cheering behind me, their voices giving me the strength to keep fighting.  \n  \nBut the cult leader was strong, too strong. He easily overpowered me, pinning me to the ground with a crazed look in his eyes.  \n  \n“You can’t escape, little one,” he hissed, his grip tightening on my throat. “You belong to us now, forever.  \n  \n”I struggled against him, gasping for air as I felt myself slipping away. But just as everything seemed lost, a loud crash echoed throughout the room, followed by the sound of shouting and gunfire.  \n  \nI looked up to see a group of armed men bursting through the door, their weapons trained on the cult leader and his followers.  \n  \n“Get the children out of here!” one of the men yelled, as the others quickly began untying us and leading us to safety.  \n  \nAs we ran through the dark corridors, I could hear the sounds of fighting behind us, the desperate cries of the cult members as they were taken down.  \n  \nWe finally emerged into the night air, blinking in the sudden brightness. I looked around at the other kids, seeing the mixture of relief and disbelief on their faces.  \n  \nWe had done it. We had escaped the cult, escaped from the horrors that had threatened to consume us.  \n  \nAs we were ushered onto waiting buses, I looked up at the sky, feeling the cool night breeze on my face. I knew that we were safe now, that we had been given a second chance at life.  \n  \nBut as the buses pulled away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the cult would never truly be gone, that their evil would always linger in the shadows, waiting to strike again.  \n  \nI closed my eyes, praying that we would never have to face such darkness again. And as the bus rumbled on towards the dawn, I knew that no matter what horrors may come our way, we would always be survivors, forever grateful for the chance to live on."},"177":{"title":"#crazees","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frlagv\/crazees\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"devvra","selftext":"\/\/OP's note: I am actually a translator\/adaptor, found this pasta on Polish sites and found it out amazing, so I've translated it some time ago to other subreddit, but thought you'll like it - original you can find here [https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/pl\/wiki\/Czat\\_\"poyeby\"](https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/pl\/wiki\/Czat_\"poyeby\") \n\n--\n\nI was asked to research the deaths of seven teenagers for an article. They had died, more or less, at the same time in front of their computers but they had all been in different parts of California. People hadn't been able to find the connection between them, though I had found one girl who had apparently been lucky enough to escape this fate. She had been the one to call the police.\n\nDo you know how she was saved?\n\nShe had logged off a few moments before everything happened.\n\nReally mysterious, right? To be honest, I'm pretty skeptical whenever people talk about these \"mysterious\" cases. The solutions are always something that makes sense. Like this? Speculations of all sorts are going around, but I've had a case like it before.\n\nLast time, it turned out to be the idoicy of today's teenagers. A mass suicide with their online friends. I know, it sounds terribly stupid to us, but young people can do crazy things. What had happened in that case? How did we hear about it? One of the people online had only pretended to take the pills to die.\n\nSo I took the case and spoke to the lone survivor, a girl: \"dolly\" She was really introverted and would evade questions, usually just shrugging or saying she didn't know. What broke her was her learning I was speaking to the families of the victims as well.\n\nShe begged me to stop. When I asked why, she finally told me something useful. They were online friends, ten of them. Most of them had never met in person, but they had made their own chat client, with their own channels and everything. It wasn't IRC, but it looked a lot like it. It was through this that two of them got to know each other better, meeting in real life and dating. Dolly couldn't continue, she just begged me to not look into it, to leave it alone.\n\nI couldn't do that though. I had a job to do. When I learned of it, I got permission to look at a computer. The parents said it hadn't been touched, that they hadn't wanted to disturb anything. I don't know if it's true or not but they had brought me to a laptop that was unplugged with the battery on the table.\n\nOur tech specialist said it was difficult. I won't bore you with all his jargon because honestly, I don't know what he meant with most of it. He was saying it was pretty much a miracle he found it. Exaggeration much? Seriously, he went on about how the database apparently didn't want to say that day even existed and he found frames and... Yeah. I told you I didn't understand him.\n\nBut hey, he found it, so that was good enough for me. It had a bunch of gibberish on it, but it was pretty easy to read through. Look. I told my boss I couldn't write the article. Namely because I don't know what happened to these kids. As for their parents, well, I had to tell the truth: the kids weren't part of a suicide cult or anything, not like others. But as for what happened... well, hell if I know.\n\nI think I'm done with investigative reporting for a bit though. This is just... I don't know. It's just fucked up, plain and simple. I think I owe the families the truth though. And the people who were saying all sorts of things about these kids... I owe it to them to try and put it right.\n\nSo here's the log that we salvaged. Read it at your own risk.\n\nAnd I mean that literally and legally, as in you can't sue us if anything happens.\n\n\n\n¶æî²««\n\n\\* windy \\[\\~windrunner-sylv12@\\*\\] has joined #crazees\n\n&lt;crowned&gt; sure, you always shift responsibility on me xD you should meet when i had time now youre only complaining\n\n&lt;crowned&gt; windyyyyy!!!!1 :&gt;:&gt;:&gt;\n\n&lt;paperjet&gt; ok, enough, crown ;p I couldn't, that's all. too bad\n\n&lt;paperjet&gt; WIIIIIND &lt;3333\n\n&lt;breindamage&gt; Windy :O It's have been a while (:\n\n\\* human has quit\n\n\\* human \\[\\~bigthong69@\\*\\] has joined #crazees\n\n&lt;human&gt; fuck this shit again\n\n&lt;human&gt; wind :D what's up kiddo\n\n&lt;crowned&gt; and again shes quiet xddd wind whats up, you werent here for a month explain yourself hahaha\n\n&lt;breindamage&gt; Yeah, I was so worried.

","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frjvyn\/the_mysteries_of_the_eastern_los_diablitos_range\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Collective1985","selftext":"The Mysteries of the Eastern Los Diablitos Range \n\n\n\nNestled between the formidable embrace of the Rocky Mountains, where Utah and Idaho converge in a dance of rugged beauty and uncharted wilderness, lies the Eastern Los Diablitos Range, an area steeped in a history that whispers of ancient terrors and unexplained enigmas, the very name of this range, \"The Little Devils\" echoing the haunting whispers of its storied past because of numerous sightings of strange creatures and demonic forces haunting every corner of the range playing deadly tricks such as making rocks fall on top of people, pushing hapless travelers off the cliff, and other malicious behavior that is reminiscent of imps and the inhabitants of Hell itself.\n\n\nThe Spaniards, pioneers of the 16th century, were the first to lay claim to this land, their footsteps etched into the very earth that seemed to tremble beneath them and named it thus for the treacherous nature of the terrain, unknowingly invoking the malevolent spirits that dwell within its shadowy crevices and towering peaks, as well the indigenous inhabitants, the Native Americans, had long ago recognized the sinister aura that clung to these mountains, naming them the \"Mountains of Dreadful Screams\" in a language that held the very essence of fear and respect for the malevolent spirits and monsters that prowled the land followed by the screams of victims and the wails of lost souls.\n\n\nIt was not until the mid-19th century that the allure of wealth and prosperity drew the first wave of settlers to the region, their dreams fueled by tales of gold and fertile lands as the intrepid prospectors, farmers, and other pioneers founded towns such as Lone Creek, Jaspertown, and the Whittier Ranch, their numbers swelling with each discovery of gold and promise of a better life, they built with haste and hope, unaware of the grim shadow that loomed over their nascent communities.\n\n\nLone Creek, a tiny bastion of civilization perched precariously on the border between Utah and Idaho, grew as the gold rush brought a fervor of life and ambition to its dusty streets but the whispers grew louder with each sunset, telling of a force that was not of this world, something that watched and waited, biding its time until it could strike anytime as the veil of peace was finally torn asunder and Lone Creek was ravaged by a series of incidents that defied human understanding, a tapestry of horror woven from the threads of the unexplained and the unthinkable.\n\n\nThe year was 1869, and the tranquility of Lone Creek was shattered by a spate of gruesome incidents that seemed to escalate in their brutality and bizarreness as people began to vanish without a trace, only to be found days later at the bottom of cliffs, their bodies arranged in unnatural poses that seemed almost ritualistic, the men and women of the town were found with their arms by their sides, knees bent, and their faces frozen in grisly smiles as if mocking the very gods themselves.\n\n\nBefore the encroachment, various local Native American tribes had long warned of the wrathful spirits that dwelt within the Eastern Los Diablitos Range, and their pleas for respect and caution fell on deaf ears until it was too late as the settlers ignored the warnings, dismissing them as mere superstition until the very land seemed to rise against them, claiming lives with a cruel indifference that could only be attributed to an otherworldly power.\n\n\nThe late 19th century saw the Eastern Los Diablitos Range become a crucible of fear with various accounts of unexplained phenomena such as strange lights in the sky, foul odors from one of the valleys, cattle going missing and returned rabid, hairy creatures who tried to abduct the women and children, and other terrifying occurrences that were recorded by the town's historians but were often dismissed as weather patterns and animals that had gone mad due to the harsh conditions.\n\n\nBut as the years passed, the events grew more disturbing and more frequent, with cattle found mutilated in a way that no predator could replicate and poultry suffering from deformities that seemed to defy the very laws of nature as chickens laid eggs filled with a viscous, green substance that smelled of sulfur, and the fruit from the orchards rotted on the trees, their once-juicy flesh now a breeding ground for wriggling worms and maggots, and the crops withered and turned to dust, leaving the farmers with a sense of foreboding that grew with each harvest lost to the mysterious blight.\n\n\nThe 1870s through the 1890s were particularly dire, with the land itself seemingly turning against its inhabitants, as droughts ravaged the once fertile soil and unexplained rains brought forth not life but decay, turning the once-verdant valleys into barren wastelands that mirrored the desolate hearts of the people who had dared to call it home was now unrecognizable as a blighted and cursed land of despair as the local authorities and agricultural experts were baffled and overwhelmed by the sheer strangeness of the phenomena that plagued the region, their every attempt to understand or combat it met with failure, leaving the community to fend for itself in the face of the unknown.\n\n\nEverything went wrong within the Eastern Los Diablitos Range's dark history was not confined to the pastoral plights of its early inhabitants, as the 20th century dawned, so too did a new era of terror and 1969 saw the creation of the Eastern Los Diablitos Range State Park, a move that filled the residents of Lone Creek and the surrounding areas with a deep sense of dread and untouched beauty of the wilderness beckoned to the adventurous souls from far and wide, luring them into the very jaws of the malevolent force that had long held sway over the land, and as more people ventured into the park, the whispers grew into screams, as the horrors that had once been confined to the shadows of the past now stalked the very trails that crisscrossed the range.\n\n\nThe tranquil nights were pierced by the screams of bizarre creatures that seemed to come from the very bowels of the earth, their twisted forms illuminated by the eerie glow of unexplained lights that danced through the sky, leaving a trail of madness in their wake as travelers spoke of being pursued by massive wolves whose eyes burned with an unearthly light, and their cries echoed through the desolate valleys like a chorus of the damned as the allure of the Eastern Los Diablitos Range did not go unnoticed, and it became a playground for the morbidly curious and the desperate who sought refuge from their demons but found themselves face to face with something far more terrifying than their darkest nightmares.\n\n\nSuddenly things took a dark turn and seemed to give rise to a human monster, a serial killer who prowled the park leaving behind a grisly trail of mutilated bodies as the authorities remained stumped by the sheer savagery of the crimes and the apparent lack of motive, some believed it to be the work of the legendary boogeyman of the region or perhaps one of the infamous serial killers like the uncaught Lone Creek Strangler who had been known to roam these lands looking for new victims to satisfy their twisted desires, but no one was certain and fear ruled the hearts of all who lived in the shadow of the Eastern Los Diablitos Range.\n\n\nThe unpredictable weather patterns added to the horror, bringing with them sudden storms that unleashed a cacophony of howling winds and multicolored lightning that painted the sky in a macabre dance of death as clouds of various colors, ominous and foreboding, hung low over the land, casting a pall of gloom that seemed to seep into the very soul of those unlucky enough to be caught beneath them, and the smell of the rain was not of life but of decay, leaving a greasy film on everything it touched, a grim reminder of the malevolent forces that held dominion over this forsaken place.\n\n\nAt this point, the Eastern Los Diablitos Range had become a breeding ground for fear and dread, a place where the veil between reality and the supernatural had grown thin, and through which the whispers of the past could still be heard as the echoes of ancient battles and the cries of the long-dead seemed to mingle with the screams of those who had stumbled upon such unspeakable things that their very sanity was called into question.\n\n\nThe Eastern Los Diablitos Range is not just a location on a map but a living, breathing malevolent spirit of darkness that has played a significant role in the local folklore of UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters, particularly from the 1940s through to the late 2000s as the region's eerie reputation grew, so too did the fascination with the unexplained, and the area became a hotbed for UFO enthusiasts and those seeking to unravel the mysteries of the American frontier and the Wild West that was long buried underneath years of terror.\n\n\nBy the time that the 1940s rolled around, a time of global conflict and the birth of the modern military-industrial complex, saw the Eastern Los Diablitos Range used as a training ground for pilots and soldiers, and it was during these tumultuous times that reports of unidentified flying objects began to emerge from the shadows like phantoms in the night sky, their forms bending the very fabric of reality as pilots and military personnel alike described encounters with aircraft that moved with a grace and speed that defied human understanding, often accompanied by a symphony of lights that seemed to dance in the heavens as if to mock the mortals being innocent civilians or outlaws no one was spared.\n\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s, the golden age of UFO sightings, brought with them a surge in reports from the Eastern Los Diablitos Range, with witnesses describing encounters with beings that were not of this world, their crafts descending from the stars to conduct inexplicable experiments or perhaps simply to observe the humans who had intruded upon their domain as the air was filled with the hum of their spacecraft, and the ground trembled beneath their alien steps.\n\n\nOne of the most infamous incidents occurred in the late 1950s when a group of campers claimed to have had a close encounter with a landed UFO, describing a metallic craft that hovered just above the ground, casting a soft, pulsing light upon the terrified witnesses as the air grew thick with a static charge, and from within, they claimed to have seen diminutive figures that moved with unnatural grace, beings that were unlike anything they had ever encountered or imagined.\n\n\nThen came the sightings of violent and hairy humanoids with a foul odor and glowing red eyes, often accompanied by the sudden silence of the wildlife, became a common theme in the region and its folklore as the decades passed, with some encounters ending in tragedy as these creatures, known as the \"wildmen\" posed a great threat to tourists, campers, park rangers because of their unpredictable and violent nature, leaving behind only the shredded tents and the torn clothing of their unfortunate prey as grim reminders of their presence making themselves known who is in charge of the desolate terrain and leaving the area stained with fear and uncertainty.\n\n\nThe 2000s brought a heightened sense of dread as the number of reported UFO sightings began to increase, leading some to question whether the phenomena had intensified or if it was simply a product of the digital age, where cameras and smartphones had become the tools of the masses to capture the unexplained as the years marched on and the sightings grew became terrifying and grim reminders of the unknown, the Eastern Los Diablitos Range remained a bastion of intrigue and terror for those brave or perhaps foolish enough to venture into its embrace.\n\n\nEastern Los Diablitos Range, a place where history, geography, and the supernatural converge in a tapestry of suspense and horror, stands as a grim reminder that there are places on this earth that are best left untouched by human hands, for within its rugged peaks and shadowy valleys lie secrets that may never be fully understood, and a darkness that may never be fully banished with thousands of years of history, this place has become a playground for the unexplained and the supernatural, a testament to the inexplicable and the terrifying, forever etched into the annals of time as a place where the shadows hold more than just the secrets of the natural world.\n\n\nThe most infamous account happened on August 19th, 1989 when a group of scientists and parapsychologist set out to investigate the phenomena in the Eastern Los Diablitos Range and never returned as the same people with several of them experiencing PTSD symptoms and refusing to speak about what happened, their equipment was found scattered across the ground, and the only clue left behind was a series of incoherent recordings filled with screams and whispers that seemed to speak of things that should not be spoken of.\n\n\nAnalysis of the videos and recordings determined that they were not tampered with and the footage showed an unexplained light that seemed to interact with the scientists, shadows of creatures with glowing red eyes were seen in the corner without the knowledge of the scientists as the sounds of their screams grew louder until it was all that filled the tape, leaving behind a chilling silence that spoke of the horrors they had witnessed, a silence that would haunt the Eastern Los Diablitos Range for years to come.\n\n\nThe most terrifying anomaly to date that was found on the footage became known as the \"Night Shadow\" a malevolent and powerful as well as demonic being that was made of darkness and shadow that could take the form of the most feared creature in any human's mind, making it the most feared and dangerous predator in the area as it fed on the fears of the team until they were driven mad.\n\n\nIn the first encounter with this horrifying force of pure malevolence, the scientists found a dead cow with its throat slit and eyes removed as some sort of sick ritual of the Night Shadow which was a clear message to stay away from its territory, a warning that was not heeded almost costing the sanity of the team as the investigation was abandoned and they were airlifted to a hospital for evaluation and some of them never recovered by the sightings of evil and twisted amalgamations of fear as well as hatred.\n\n\nOver the years the Eastern Los Diablitos Range became a place where the line between reality and nightmare blurs, where the whispers of the past echo through the valleys, and where the unexplained continues to cast its shadow over the land, inviting only the most daring and curious souls to venture within its embrace, to seek the truth behind the legends and the whispers, and perhaps, if they are not careful, to become a part of them as the very air seems to thicken with tension and the whispers of the past seem to grow louder, hinting at a world just beyond our own, a world filled with unspeakable horrors that may be waiting for the next unsuspecting traveler to stumble upon them.\n\n\nThe unpredictable weather patterns that plague the region only serve to heighten the sense of unease, with sudden storms that seem to come from nowhere, bringing with them a chilling cold that reaches into the very bones of those unlucky enough to be caught in their path, and lightning that dances across the sky in a rainbow of hues that seems almost otherworldly and clouds that look like they were painted with the very essence of decay and despair, and the smell of death and decay that often accompanied the storms seemed to be a part of the very fabric of the Eastern Los Diablitos Range.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Eastern Los Diablitos Range remains a place of dread and fascination, a land where the whispers of the past mingle with the cries of the present, and where the line between reality and the supernatural grows ever thinner, a place where the secrets of the universe may lie hidden, waiting to be discovered by those brave or foolish enough to seek them out, a place where the very earth seems to breathe with a malicious intent, a place where the whispers of the \"Mountains of Dreadful Screams\" can still be heard, echoing through the canyons and valleys, a stark reminder of the horrors that dwell within."},"179":{"title":"The Grotesque

Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, there stood an abandoned, decrepit mansion known as Elderwood Manor. The locals avoided it, whispering tales of an otherworldly presence lurking within its crumbling walls.\n\nOne stormy night, a group of brave friends decided to explore the manor, laughing off the warnings. As they ventured deeper, they stumbled upon a dusty, forgotten room. In the center, a lone photograph lay on a decrepit dresser. The image depicted a figure unlike any they had ever seen.\n\nThe creature's body resembled a twisted, elongated corpse, with bulbous, pulsing growths sprouting from its limbs. Its face was a distorted, inhuman visage, with sunken eyes glowing like lanterns in the dark. The skin was deathly pale, pulled taut over the skeletal frame.\n\nAs they gazed upon the photo, an unsettling feeling crept over them. Suddenly, the lights flickered and died. In the darkness, an unearthly whisper seemed to emanate from the picture itself: \"I have been waiting.\"\n\nThe friends fled in terror, but one, Sarah, felt an inexplicable pull to return. She began experiencing vivid, disturbing dreams, where the creature from the photo stalked her through Elderwood's decaying halls.\n\nOne fateful night, Sarah disappeared. Her friends searched the manor, calling out her name. The only response was an eerie, whispery voice, seemingly from all directions: \"She's mine now.\"\n\nThe townsfolk found the photograph on the dresser, but something was different. Sarah's face had replaced the creature's, her eyes black as coal, her skin gray as the stone that encased Elderwood Manor.\n\nFrom that day forward, the locals avoided the manor, fearing the twisted, inhuman presence that lurked within. Some say on stormy nights, you can still hear Sarah's screams, echoing through the abandoned halls, as the creature's presence watches, waits, and whispers: \"I have been waiting.\""},"180":{"title":"(Español)Busco una creepypasta de un edificio maldito con un jardinero como guía, hombres lobo, cultistas y ascensores misteriosos","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frc5k7\/españolbusco_una_creepypasta_de_un_edificio\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"ArukuShi","selftext":"Hola a todos, llevo años buscando una creepypasta que escuché narrada con Loquendo en YouTube, dividida en varias partes (quizá 3 o 4).

Aquí les dejo todo lo que recuerdo:\n\nLa historia comienza con una chica que se muda con su novio a un edificio de departamentos. Apenas llegan, se topan con un hombre limpiando ventanas que exigía entrar. La chica no se percata, pero cuando le niegan la entrada, el hombre simplemente desaparece. Esa noche, ambos deciden dormir, ya que el novio tenía que irse a trabajar de madrugada.\n\nEl novio se va tomando el ascensor, pero a la mañana siguiente, la chica no tiene noticias de él. Ella baja también por el ascensor y se encuentra con el jardinero del edificio, quien resulta ser un personaje en extremo importante, actuando como su guía en las particularidades del lugar. Le menciona que no debe usar el ascensor de noche y que debe estar preparada, porque las escaleras pueden llevarla a cualquier piso de manera aleatoria.\n\nMás adelante, la chica asiste a juntas vecinales donde conoce a los peculiares vecinos. Entre ellos, había un hombre descrito como solitario y raro, quien más tarde se revela como un hombre lobo. Este hombre lobo termina ayudándola a defenderse de unas figuras negras malvadas, responsables de las deformidades nocturnas y la hiperactividad de los gemelos de una vecina.\n\nEstas criaturas, que parecen provenir de un piso específico del edificio, tienen conexión con unos cultistas que vivieron allí antes. Dichos cultistas murieron en un incendio y quedaron atrapados de día en los cuartos donde murieron, pero sus rituales embrujaron el lugar y lo convirtieron en un imán para otras entidades paranormales.\n\nFinalmente, la chica se entera de que su novio murió esa misma noche en el ascensor, atacado por unas criaturas parecidas a duendes.\n\n¿Alguien sabe cómo se llama esta creepypasta o tiene alguna pista sobre dónde podría encontrarla?"},"181":{"title":"The more you cut off his tongue the more he can talk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fr65nc\/the_more_you_cut_off_his_tongue_the_more_he_can\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"We grabbed the man who knew where the stash of money was.

He sat down with his tongue out and I cut a bit off. Then suddenly he could talk and it was still a little off but he could talk now.

I wasn’t fast enough for school, nor clever enough for business. But I knew how to fight. I knew how to throw a punch. My career had its ups and downs—more downs than ups—but that night, they offered me a fight with a sum of money I couldn’t refuse. I didn’t care if it was illegal or that the place was so far from the city it looked like a forgotten dump. I just wanted to settle my debt and get out for good. \n\nMy trainer, a tough man who had seen more illegal fights than legal ones, acted strange when he confirmed the offer. \n\n\"Listen, kid... this fight is... different. It’s not like the others, but... the money is good. Very good.\" \n\n“What do you mean, different?” I asked while rolling a cigarette. \n\nHe gave me a forced smile, hands trembling slightly. \"Nothing, nothing. Just... look, the guys organizing this aren’t... you know, from the boxing world. But trust me, it’s a one-time opportunity. You fight once, and you’re set for life.\" \n\nIt all sounded strange. I’m a street-hardened guy, but suddenly, I felt uneasy. \"I’m not liking this, old man. How dangerous is this?\" \n\nHe took a deep breath, lowering his voice. \"I can’t say more. I’m not allowed. I can’t tell you anything until right before the fight. Look, do you want to get out of this life once and for all or not?\" \n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, making a firm gesture. \n\n\"Then do what I say, and everything will turn out fine,\" he said, turning his back and walking away quickly, but heavily. \n\nThe fight location was a massive, ruined warehouse, filled with shadows that seemed to move on their own. Outside, the parked cars were luxurious, the kind you wouldn’t see in my neighborhood. The guards weren’t the typical bar thugs; these guys carried weapons I hadn’t even seen in movies. Inside, the crowd was restless. There was something in their eyes—something dark and hungry. It felt like they weren’t just there for the fight, but for something more, something I couldn’t understand. \n\nThey took me to an improvised locker room, dirty and damp. There was barely any light, but in the middle of the gloom, on an old, rusty chair, there was an envelope. I opened it with trembling hands. Inside was a worn piece of paper with 12 handwritten rules. I recognized my trainer’s handwriting: “These rules are your only chance to get out of here. Break one, and what you’ll lose won’t just be the fight.” \n\n \n\nRule 1: Don’t stop moving. \n\nThe fight has no rounds, no breaks. No matter how tired you get, don’t stop moving. If you stay still for more than five seconds, the crowd will notice, and they have bets placed. \n\nRule 2: Don’t look at the doctors. \n\nIf you see men in white coats and briefcases among the spectators, change your position and try to keep your opponent between you and them. You don’t want to know what they’re doing here, much less let them examine you. \n\nRule 3: Avoid being knocked down in the first 10 minutes. \n\nDuring the first 10 minutes, focus on not getting knocked down by your opponent. If you fall before that time, what’s under the ring will still be awake. \n\nRule 4: Be careful of deep cuts. \n\nIf you get seriously injured and see blood flowing, don’t let anyone from the crowd get close. Don’t let anyone touch your wound. \n\nRule 5: Never take off your gloves outside the ring. \n\nBefore the fight, they’ll offer to let you take off your gloves to “rest.” Don’t do it. Hands are the first thing they check, and they’re not looking for calluses or bruises. \n\nRule 6: Don’t accept the water they offer you between rounds. \n\nAfter the first round, someone will approach with a water bottle that isn’t from your team. Don’t drink it. \n\nRule 7: Hear, but don’t listen. \n\nDuring the fight, you’ll hear strange things in the distance: the sound of bones breaking when no one’s been hit, children crying, voices pleading or moaning in pain. Ignore them. \n\nRule 8: Don’t touch the money. \n\nIf you win, don’t take the money right away. If they give it to you in the black bag, ask them to hand it to your trainer, and get out as fast as you can. \n\nRule 9: If you see red lights, close your eyes. \n\nAt some point during the fight, the ring lights might turn red. If that happens, close your eyes for ten seconds, no matter what. If the lights stay red when you open them, jump out of the ring and run toward the exit as fast as you can. \n\nRule 10: Don’t let yourself lose. \n\nLosing here isn’t an option. If you get knocked out and can’t get up before you count to ten in your head, it’ll be too late for you. \n\nRule 11: Don’t keep fighting after the third round if you hear an extra bell. \n\nThe fight is fixed to last three rounds, but if you hear a fourth bell, stop immediately. Get out of the ring and sit at the judges' table. That signal isn’t for you—it’s for the buyers. If you keep fighting after that bell, you’re no longer in a boxing match. You’re being auctioned. \n\nRule 12: Win, but don’t knock out your opponent. \n\nThey don’t want the fight to end too quickly. If you knock him out, they’ll realize you’re stronger than they’re looking for, and you’ll become the final trophy. But if you leave him standing, even if he’s wobbling, they’ll keep their attention on the other guy. \n\nRule 13: The man with the red mask. \n\nIf, during the fight, you see a man in the front row wearing a red mask, fight for your life even if you have to break all the other rules. None is more important than this one. \n\n \n\nP.S.: Your opponent also received these rules. Don’t forget that. \n\n \n\nI froze, staring at the list. This wasn’t just a fight. It was a hunt, and I was the prey. A suited man appeared again and led me to the ring. My legs were shaking, but I couldn’t afford to hesitate. I felt the eyes of the audience on my skin as if they were already deciding which part of me was worth more. \n\nThe fight began. My opponent was strong, but something in him seemed broken. He wasn’t fighting to win—he was fighting for his life. I kept the rules in mind as we exchanged blows. The audience’s eyes never left us, watching every move with a hunger that went beyond mere entertainment. There was something twisted in their smiles, in the way they clapped each time one of us took a hard hit. \n\nBetween rounds, a guy from the crowd threw me a bottle of water. I remembered the third rule. My throat was dry, but I ignored the temptation. I also heard muffled cries and children’s sobs coming from somewhere far off, in the opposite direction of the exit, but I didn’t pay attention. \n\nThe referee got closer than usual during the second round. I felt his breath on my ear when he whispered, “You shouldn’t be here.” I refused to respond. I knew what interacting with him meant. I moved away and continued the fight. \n\nThe bell rang, signaling the end of the third round. But something was wrong. I heard another bell—a fourth one. The crowd started murmuring, like something grand was about to happen. I remembered the sixth rule and stood still. My opponent, unaware, moved toward me, but I stepped away. The murmurs turned into low laughter. They knew. \n\nFinally, the last round came. My opponent could barely stand, but I couldn’t knock him out. I had to leave him on his feet. I hit just enough to keep control, but not enough to drop him. The crowd seemed unsatisfied, but they ignored me completely now. Their attention was fixed on my opponent, evaluating him as if they were making decisions. Decisions that had nothing to do with boxing. \n\nThe final bell rang, and I won. But I didn’t feel relief. I looked around, and for a second, I saw something that chilled me to the bone: in the front row, a man with a baby-faced red mask, dressed in white, was sitting, leaning forward, watching. Suddenly, he stood, approached my opponent’s corner, and pulled a jar of what looked like powder from his pocket, sprinkling it on the ground. Then, he pulled a red handkerchief from another pocket, tied it to one of the ring ropes, and walked away. My opponent sat dazed and slumped on his stool until one of the men in white coats, with fully tattooed arms, came over, whispered something to him, and they walked toward a room opposite the exit. \n\nI left the ring quickly, not waiting for my payment. I knew it wasn’t safe to stay. The guards looked at me, but none stopped me. The feeling of danger clung to my skin like cold sweat. \n\nThat was my last fight. I never put the gloves on again. I knew I had barely escaped. But sometimes, in the dark of my room, I feel the audience’s eyes on me, waiting. And I can’t help but wonder how much longer it will be until they come to claim what they believe belongs to them. "},"183":{"title":"My harems keeps growing in numbers ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1frc69x\/my_harems_keeps_growing_in_numbers\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I thought I was cool and because I was also rich, I thought that I deserved a harem of women surrounding me in my house hold.

Then she understood why I felt like the way I did, and she brought home another woman to start my harem. I was so happy and we all got along so well and I couldn't believe it at all. Then the second woman brought another woman into my house hold. \n\nI was over the moon as my first wife and the second woman were happy with the third woman.

It wasn’t anything special, just a novel with a tattered cover and no blurb. The title was simple: The Final Chapter. It was sitting in a stack near the back, and for $2, I figured why not?\n\nThat night, I started reading. The book was slow at first—just a guy moving to a new town, starting fresh after a breakup. Nothing exciting. But the more I read, the more familiar it felt. There were these tiny details—his favorite kind of beer, the brand of coffee he drank, even the kind of watch he wore—that matched me exactly.\n\nI laughed it off at first. Coincidence, right? It’s not like I’m the most unique person in the world. But then I got to the part where he goes to that same bookstore. He’s drawn to a specific book, The Final Chapter, the very book I was holding in my hands.\n\nI stopped reading. I stared at the page for what felt like hours, my heart racing. How could this be possible? The description of the store, the old man behind the counter, the exact location of the book on the shelf—it was all too accurate. Too real. It wasn’t just a story. It was my story.\n\nI told myself it was some kind of weird prank. Maybe the bookstore owner planted it there, some meta-marketing thing. But the bookstore wasn’t exactly high-tech, and I didn’t even pay with a card. They didn’t know my name. They didn’t know anything about me.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I kept reading.\n\nAs the main character—I guess me—continued, things started to get darker. The guy in the story started noticing weird things happening around his house. Doors left open, items moved, subtle signs that someone had been inside while he was out. It wasn’t over the top—just small, almost unnoticeable changes. Enough to mess with his head.\n\nI would’ve dismissed it as paranoid fiction if not for what I’d seen earlier that week. My kitchen window had been open when I got home from work, even though I never open it. The back door latch was undone. I thought I’d been careless, that maybe I forgot, but now I wasn’t so sure.\n\nThe book kept going, laying out every small detail of the days that followed, and each one was a reflection of my own life. I couldn’t sleep. Every noise made me jump. I started double-checking the locks, but I could feel the tension growing with every turn of the page.\n\nThen I reached the part that shattered any hope of this being just a freak coincidence. The main character—again, me—finds a note in his mailbox, tucked inside an envelope with no return address. The note says, simply: I’m watching.\n\nThis morning, I found that note in my own mailbox. Same words, same handwriting as described in the book.\n\nI’ve never felt fear like this before. The novel isn’t finished yet, but it’s heading toward something inevitable. There’s a chapter I haven’t read yet that’s coming up, titled The Visitor. I can already guess what happens. I can’t bring myself to read it.\n\nBut I know the ending. I have to. Because if I don’t, I’m afraid it’ll happen before I can see it coming.\n\nI don’t know who wrote this book, or how they know everything about me, but I’m scared to find out. And the worst part is, if I put the book down, it doesn’t change anything. It’s still happening."},"186":{"title":"My old creepypasta ocs story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fr6snc\/my_old_creepypasta_ocs_story\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Pale-Pomegranate8768","selftext":"*cold..so cold..how much longer do I have to be alone in here..?*\nAre the words that still echo in my mind. It feels like it happend yesterday because I still remember it so clearly.\n\nHi, I'm Yuki. I'll be the one to tell u guys this fucked up story. I don't think it's paranormal or whatever the hell people call shit that happens to be scary, but whatever, doesn't matter now does it? June 8th, the second Saturday in June, is the day it happened.\n\nI didn't have school or anything to really do, so I decided to take a walk in the forest nearby. Dumb idea but okay.. After not even. 10 minutes of walking I started hearing faint giggling, i mean, what the hell?! I know forests are related to creepy stuff and shit but really?! Whatever, is what I thought. It was probably just some kids playing fucked up pranks. \n\nI started walking again until I heard giggling again, seriously? I decided to turn around to look where the gigglings coming from, but nothing was there. \" Hey? Is anyone there? \" I said cautiously. Suddenly a little girl peeks up from behind a tree. \" hi. \" The child said, she had a hospital gown on and had lots of cuts on her right leg..i wonder why.. she didn't show much expression and just stared at me blankly, it's kinda eerie..\n\n \" uhm, hi ? \" I exclaimed. I just stared at the little girl before stepping back. \" Where's the nearest hospital? \" The girl asked me, tilting her head as she smiled abit. I should've just ran but the kid was covered in cuts I can't just leave her in a forest all alone can I ? Well , yes I can , just that's beside the point okay ?! \" Oh um , what did u say ? \" Shit. I wasn't paying attention, something u probably should do in a GODAMM FOREST?! \n\" Hospital . \" \n\" The nearest one? \" \n\" Yes. \" \n\" Well, there's not really a hospital near a forest is there? \" After I said that she kinda just looked at me and I looked back. Nobody said anything for like.. the past 5 minutes. \" Gosh, u have no sense of humor. \" I don't remember why I even said that to a child , a child asking where the nearest hospital is at that. \" Ur humor is terrible. \" Wow, really? what's wrong with this kid? \n\n \" Ahem, anyways, we can't really walk to the nearest hospital. Maybe we can go to my house so u can call ur parents ? If u even have ones.. \" I admit, I mumbled that last part. I wasn't going to tell a child it looks like they don't have parents. I'm not that terrible of a person, Goddammit. \n\" I don't think going to a strangers house would be smart. \"\n\" HEY!? U THINK IM SOME KINDA CHILD PREDATOR?! \"\n\" Yes. \"\n\" ... \" I just kinda stared at her dumbfounded. \" Get lost. \" I turned around and started walking again, this time faster then I was walking in the beginning. \" Wait. \". The little girl said , when I turned around she was right behind me. Still staring at me but this time smiling as she took me hand in hers and said , \n\" wanna play hide and seek? \"\n\" Not really - \"\n\" Great! I'll count. \"\n\" ......are u deaf? \" \n\" One ... Two ... \"\nUgh, really? I never liked playing hide and seek, plus, it was getting really late. \" Didn't u wanna find a hospital? \" The girl stopped smiling for a second then continued, now also giggling. \n\nSuddenly, the girl pulled out something then attempted to hit me with it?! Was it scissors? I couldnt tell. I tried to push her away and did successfully, the girl stumbled back and said, \" ... We're not done playing.. My names mizuki sagaru. \"\n\" That's random. \"\n\" Look behind u. \" I turned away only for nothing to be behind me, I was starting to get irritated. \" Nothing's ther- \" when I turned back tho .. I was surprised. \"Mizuki\" wasn't there? \" Huh.. \" I thought to myself. That doesn't matter tho, why am I just standing here?! I started running back to my house, wanting to be away from this god forsaken forest as fast as possible. When I finally arrived at my house, the first thing I did was call the police. I mean, there's a child in a forest ALONE? it doesn't matter if she tried to attack me, she's still in the forest alone.\n\nWhile waiting for the police, I decided to look up her name. There were only two results. When seeing them, my eyes widened in horror. There was one picture and one video. The picture was that mizuki girl hanging by the neck in a forest bleeding heavily, I'm not gonna describe it much considering it literally looked like she was hit by a train. The recording was her saying stuff like \" how much longer do I have to alone in here ... ? \" And more. When the police finally arrived they told me to stay at home while they check the forest. I haven't heard about kizuki since, nor do I want do. I'm doing alright now.\nAnyways, thanks for reading or whatever go away now."},"187":{"title":"Creepypasta fan theory ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fr4fwg\/creepypasta_fan_theory\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Icy_Buyer_216","selftext":"As both realms is apart of purgatory for the creepypasta world is set in hell. for what they call it the under realm as hell and the pasta characters don't seem to age as one of there fate was at earth due to timeline was apart of 2010s of nostalgia.

We went urban exploring. This was our 3rd time doing urbex and it happened last week.\n\nI want to document how strange this whole ordeal was. So im writing this down. It was quite a warm day so we packed a large amount of water.\nI remember seeing the 12 bottles Alex had put in the Ethans campervan before we left along with a pack of marlboro cigarettes and some beers to get through the heat.\n\nThe drive was far longer than our previous urbex trips and i noticed the change of environment as the route only seemed to get more desolate. \nOnce we arrived Ethan parked the van in a shaded area by some trees.\n\nIt was a broad building and visably worn, i thought it was really cool and probably going to be our most interesting trip.\nWe walked in the building and split up for a while, personally i wanted to find leftover belongings or something i could sell, but i know Ethan was here for the exploring.\n\nI met back with Alex and he showed me an elevator. It looked like an older form of evelator with bars infront of it, almost boxed off.\n\nBut now we knew there was a lower level we both wanted to find it before Ethan, as Ethan usually discovers the interesting stuff. I see a door close by and open it to show a large flight of stairs which leads downwards underneath the building.\n\nAlex calls Ethan and we walk down the passage of stairs which only seemed to get darker, in the moment i could feel Alex's warm breath on the back of my neck.\n\nI said to him 'Alex your too close'\nHe replied 'turn around'. \nWhen i turned around Alex seemed to be atleast 3 feet away from me, that left me slightly surprised. I do have claustrophobia so i brushed it off.\n\nDuring such a hot day, suddenly it felt rather cold. The further we went, the smaller the passage seemed to get, making our footsteps sound slightly louder as we descended.\nIn the moment i thought i could hear a fourth persons footsteps, coming down after us. Ethan suddenly stopped.\n\n 'is something wrong?' i asked him and to my shock he replied\n'just an echo i suppose' before Continuing further. I suddenly realised he had heard the exact same footsteps as me. I actually wasn't imagining it.\nI looked back and realised alex seemed pale 'are you alright Alex?' \nI asked, hoping he would confirm hearing other footsteps but he simply said 'im fine' and continued walking, which really fucked with me.\nMaybe it really was just an echo and i was over reacting. I just continue walking until we come to a hault.\n\nI dont know what this building was previously used for but it reminded me of a parking lot. Large empty space with racks of some sort lined across it.\nEthan brought up the absolutely fucking brilliant idea of splitting up to search for interesting things, i nervously snapped back with 'Alex stick with me'\n\nIt definitely felt colder but much more quiet without the echoing sound of footsteps down a corridor. We slowly tried out best to search the racks in darkness.\nFor a couple of minutes before i heard a very small piercing sound through the air, around some racks near us, it sounded so much like wheezing, like deep breathing.\n\nI knew Ethan had asthma so i whispered lightly across the racks\n\n'Ethan, do you need your inhaler?' \nNo response. \n\n'Ethan i have your inhaler if you need it'\nStill, no Ethan.\n\nAlex shouted 'Ethan where are you'\n\n'Im over here, calm down.'\nThe sudden horror crept in as we both realised ethan was at the other end of the hall\nI looked back at Alex and i say to him 'i dont feel great, lets go'\nHe responded with\n'Ethan we're heading back now, let's go'\n\nI actually ran towards the corridor and since it was dark i hit my foot against the first step but i didnt care, i just wanted to get out,\nI actually fractured my foot because of this but the adrenaline made it feel like nothing.\n\nI ran up the stairs, our running definitely shook Ethan since we could hear him begin to run back to the entrance as well. As soon as i made it to the top i just dashed outside and towards the van.\nI turned around and realised Alex was choking. I run back and hit his back violently. He coughed up a lit cigarette he had swallowed, we made it to the van and jumped straight in.\n\nNobody wanted to mention how tense the moment was, but i could tell Alex was stressed. By now he had smoked 8 cigarettes already, and the pack was crumpled from his clenching.\nI regret leaving Ethan but at the time adrenaline was my only sense of reasoning. Finally Ethan walks out looking incredibly pissed.\n\nHe gets in the van and slams the door \n'How about my fucking inhaler Alex'\nHe said, while wheezing. After this incident I didn't know what to think, here i am writing this down at midnight.

Honestly you never want something in your house that scurries. But they're quick, and they have great vision. They'll usually see you before you see them. And they'll usually watch you from their little hiding places. They'll usually scurry away if you turn on a light, or if they feel your footsteps. They'll usually only watch from their little hiding places, but not always.\n\nSometimes they linger a little bit when a light comes on, observing your face for a few moments before bolting back into the wall. Sometimes they come out while you're still awake and moving around. Sometimes they watch you from their little hiding places, but sometimes they watch you from a little bit closer. Sometimes they get curious and follow you to your bed.\n\nThey have a grotesque shape, rigid but bending to fit whatever opening is available for them. They are small enough to get around but big enough to be seen scurrying across a room. They make sounds, small chittering noises that you can barely hear, unless you remain perfectly silent. At night, I can hear them in the walls. I can hear them in the ceiling. I can hear them in the room with me.\n\nThey live in houses, our houses. They live in the walls and the crawlspace, and we just can't seem to get rid of them. They scurry into the vents and behind the crown molding. They live in our houses and we can't get rid of them. Usually I sleep with the lights on, but tonight there's a storm. Sometimes the power goes out during storms. I can't get rid of them. They live in our houses. All of our houses. Sleep with your lights on."},"192":{"title":"The Haunting of Old Changi Hospital","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fr3yxy\/the_haunting_of_old_changi_hospital\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the chilling story of the Old Changi Hospital and its ghostly resident.

We made a drinking game surrounding the event and I know I more than likely had one too many.  I remember  getting into my vehicle to drive home that night, then… nothing.\n\n   I was plagued with fever dreams. Sporadic and nonsensical. Only broken up by moments of… clarity? It’s dark and I can hear people speaking about me. I can hear My family (whom I’ve been estranged from) crying about me. I can feel my body periodically being moved around by someone… but I cannot respond in any meaningful way.\n\n  I think I may have recently undergone some sort of surgery as I could hear the sound of what I believe to be a “saw” and felt some slight discomfort, like when a dentist fills in a cavity on a numb tooth. Except this feeling was in my head (more accurately my skull). Now I don’t dream but I believe I have access to… the internet? Unless that is now my one, long, and continuous dream.\n\n  Is this real? How do I prove it’s not all in my head? Should I reach out to my family?

They’re just goofy, oversized dudes with face paint and squeaky shoes, right? Well, I used to think the same… until he showed up.\n\nIt all started at a circus. You know, the usual: overpriced cotton candy, bored parents, and a clown that looked like he lost a bet with life. I’d had a rough day, and honestly, I wasn’t in the mood to deal with the red-nosed joker wobbling around on stage.\n\nHe did this bit where he tripped over his giant shoes, honked his nose, and sprayed water from a flower pinned to his chest. It was… painful to watch. The crowd gave him pity laughs, but I couldn’t hold back.\n\n“Wow,” I shouted, “Did you get your comedy routine from a cereal box, or are you just naturally unfunny?”\n\nThe audience chuckled awkwardly. The clown just… stared at me, his painted smile frozen in place. It was weird, but I shrugged it off. He stumbled through the rest of his act, and when the show ended, I left without a second thought.\n\nThe next day, I saw the news.\n\nLocal Clown Found Dead in Circus Tent After Show.\n\nApparently, the poor guy took his own life that night. And I… well, I couldn’t shake the feeling that my comment had something to do with it. But that’s ridiculous, right? I mean, sure, I was kind of a jerk, but it’s not like he would—right?\n\nFast forward a few days, and things started getting weird. Really weird.\n\nIt began with little stuff. I’d hear squeaky shoes behind me when no one was there. Sometimes, late at night, I’d catch a faint whiff of cotton candy. I tried to brush it off—maybe I was just feeling guilty. But then came the laughter.\n\nIt wasn’t the kind of laughter you hear at a comedy club. No, this was creepy laughter, high-pitched and echoing. It would start soft, almost like it was coming from far away, but then it would get louder and louder until it was like someone was laughing right next to my ear.\n\nOne night, I’d had enough. I was lying in bed, trying to sleep, when the laughter started again. “Okay, clown ghost,” I muttered to the empty room, “If you’re gonna haunt me, at least do something.”\n\nBad move.\n\nThe laughter stopped. Dead silence. I sat up, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. Then, slowly, I heard the sound of squeaky shoes dragging across the floor. I looked toward the doorway, and there he was—the clown. Except now, he was translucent and hovering a few inches above the ground. His painted smile was still there, but his eyes… oh, his eyes were dead.\n\n“Thought you were funny, huh?” the ghost-clown said, his voice echoing like he was speaking through a cheap carnival speaker. “Did I make you laugh?”\n\n“I—uh, well…” I stammered, inching toward the edge of the bed. “Look, man, I didn’t mean it, okay? I just—”\n\n“No one laughs at me,” the clown snapped, floating closer, his face distorting into something nightmarish. His smile stretched too wide, his painted tears dripping down his cheeks like wet paint. “Now it’s my turn to laugh.”\n\nBefore I could react, he honked his nose—HONK!—and suddenly, a pie flew out of nowhere and smacked me square in the face. I blinked, wiping whipped cream from my eyes, only for another pie to come flying at me. WHAM!\n\n“Okay, okay, I get it! I’m sorry!” I yelled, dodging another pie. But he wasn’t done.\n\nThe lights in the room flickered, and suddenly, my bed started spinning like some kind of carnival ride gone wrong. I held on for dear life as the room blurred around me. The clown floated above me, cackling like a maniac. “This is just the beginning, buddy! You’re gonna ride the Clown Show forever!”\n\n“NOOO!” I screamed, trying to crawl off the bed, but it felt like I was stuck on some twisted merry-go-round. My vision swirled, and I was pretty sure I was gonna puke at any second.\n\nThe clown hovered closer, his red nose inches from my face. “How does it feel, huh? You think you’re funny now?”\n\n“I TAKE IT BACK!” I shouted. “You were hilarious! Funniest clown ever! Please, just stop!”\n\nHe paused, hovering in front of me, his grotesque smile still plastered on his face. “Hilarious, huh?” He floated down to the floor, crossing his arms. “You really think so?”\n\n“YES!” I wiped pie off my face and staggered off the bed, which had finally stopped spinning. “You were the best part of the show, I swear.”\n\nFor a moment, he just stared at me, his dead eyes unblinking. Then, slowly, he honked his nose again. “Honk-honk.”\n\nI braced myself for another pie, but nothing happened. The room was silent, the air heavy. The clown’s form began to shimmer, and before I knew it, he faded into thin air, leaving me standing there in the middle of my room, covered in whipped cream, utterly humiliated.\n\nI thought it was over—finally, some peace. But just as I was about to sit down, I heard it. A faint, distant honking.\n\nAnd a voice, echoing through the air:\n\n“I’ll be watching you, buddy.”\n\nSo now, I live in constant fear of ghost pies and haunting honks. My advice? Never insult a circus clown. You never know when one might come back from the dead to haunt your every move.\n\nAnd trust me, they don’t play fair."},"195":{"title":"Don’t try this at home ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqunrl\/dont_try_this_at_home\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"Brotatochip411","selftext":"When the mask came to life, it didn’t happen all at once.\n\nIt started as a simple craft project. Just something for Halloween. I found an old cereal box in the recycling, grabbed some paints and glue, and decided to make my own mask. Mom wasn’t going to buy me a costume this year; money was tight. But I didn’t care. I wanted to make something special.\n\nI cut holes for the eyes, added a sharp grin with black marker, and glued on pieces of yarn for hair. Only, halfway through, I realized we didn’t have enough yarn left.\n\nThat’s when the idea hit me. I grabbed a pair of scissors and snipped a small lock of my own hair. Just a little. It seemed harmless enough. I glued it right in the middle of the mask’s forehead, watching it stick to the cardboard, almost like it belonged there.\n\nThe mask was done. I held it up, admiring my work. The face looked…off. Its grin was a little too wide. Its eyes too dark, too hollow. But I shrugged it off and tried it on.\n\nThat’s when things got strange.\n\nAt first, it was just an odd feeling, like the mask was too tight against my skin. I pulled it off after a few minutes, and as I held it in my hands, I could swear it was watching me. The eyes, which I’d cut so carefully, felt like they were narrowing, focusing.\n\nI set it down on my desk and went to bed. I tried to forget about the weird feeling. It was just cardboard and glue. But that night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing something—scratching, like someone was dragging their nails across my wall. I turned over, trying to ignore it, but then I heard it again, louder.\n\nI flicked on my bedside lamp. The sound stopped immediately, the room returning to an unnatural quiet. And then I saw it. The mask.\n\nIt was sitting on my desk, exactly where I’d left it, but something was different. The lock of my hair I had glued onto it—it had grown.\n\nI stared at it, my chest tightening. The hair, my hair, was longer now, twisting down the side of the mask like it was alive. I wanted to throw it away right then, but I couldn’t move. I just sat there, staring. That’s when the mask shifted.\n\nI swear I saw it. The eyes moved, ever so slightly, turning toward me. The grin widened, stretching further than it should have, splitting the cardboard edges.\n\nMy heart pounded in my ears, and I grabbed the mask, intending to rip it apart. But as soon as my fingers touched it, a voice, soft and whispering, echoed inside my head.\n\n“Let me in.”\n\nI dropped it immediately, stumbling back. The mask fell to the floor with a soft thud. I waited, holding my breath, but the voice didn’t return. I wanted to scream for Mom, but something stopped me. It felt like the mask knew me now, like it had taken a piece of me with that hair.\n\nThe next morning, I convinced myself I’d imagined it all. I’d been tired, my mind playing tricks on me. I grabbed the mask and stuffed it in the bottom drawer of my desk, shoving clothes over it. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nBut it didn’t stay there. That night, I woke up again to the sound of scratching. I sat up, my heart already racing, and there it was. The mask. On my desk, watching me.\n\nThe hair was even longer now, curling around the sides like vines. I should’ve been terrified, but there was something else creeping in—curiosity. I got out of bed and walked toward it, slowly, like I was being drawn to it.\n\nAs soon as my fingers brushed the cardboard surface, the whispering started again, louder this time.\n\n“Let me in.”\n\nI couldn’t pull my hand away. The mask felt warm, like it had a pulse. And then I felt it—the mask wasn’t just watching me. It was waiting. Waiting for me to put it on again.\n\nI don’t know what came over me, but I lifted it up, hands shaking, and pressed it to my face. The moment it touched my skin, I felt something shift inside me. The mask tightened around my head, the cardboard edges digging into my scalp, the lock of my hair now tangled and woven into the mask itself.\n\nI tried to scream, but the mask wouldn’t let me. My mouth wouldn’t move. The whispering turned into a chant, a steady, rhythmic command.\n\n“You can’t take it off. You’re mine now.”\n\nI yanked at the mask, desperate to pull it away, but it held fast. My reflection in the mirror across the room showed something worse. The mask wasn’t just stuck to me. It was becoming me.\n\nThe cardboard faded, merging with my skin. The eyes, those dark, hollow eyes, were now my own. The grin… I could feel it stretching across my face.\n\nI clawed at it, pulling and tearing, but it was useless. The mask had won. It had taken me.\n\nAnd now, as I sit here writing this, I don’t know how much time I have left. It’s getting harder to think, harder to fight. The mask is in control, and it’s hungry. It wants more than just me.\n\nIf you ever find yourself making your own Halloween mask, if you ever think it’s a harmless project, don’t use anything that belongs to you.\n\nBecause it’ll come to life.\n\nAnd it’ll want everything."},"196":{"title":"There is something knocking on my window","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqht6x\/there_is_something_knocking_on_my_window\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Brotatochip411","selftext":"\nIt’s 1:23 AM, and someone—or something—is knocking on my window. That shouldn’t be possible. I’m on the second story, far above the ground.\n\nI’ve already gone through every explanation I can think of. No bugs, no animals, no branches, not even loose siding that could be rattling. The nearest tree isn’t close enough, yet the sound persists—a hurried and deliberate tapping, like someone standing right outside.\n\nNo one is there. Nothing is there.\n\nAt first, I thought it might be my imagination. You know how sometimes you hear things late at night that aren’t really there? But this… I know what I’m hearing. It’s steady, not the three slow knocks of a horror movie. It’s fast and persistent, then silence. A minute passes, and I hear it again.\n\nI’m sitting here, trying not to think too much about it. I know there’s no way anyone could be out there, not this high up. But the knocking isn’t stopping. It’s deliberate.\n\nThen, from the other side of the room, more knocking.\n\nIt’s moved. The opposite window now.\n\nWait—it hasn’t moved. It’s just more knocking, like the windows are having a conversation back and forth.\n\nIt’s relentless. The sound echoes in the quiet of my room.\n\nI get up and pull back the curtain on the opposite window, peering out into the dark.\n\nNothing.\n\nJust the empty space between my window and the ground. But as I’m about to let the curtain fall, I hear it again. It’s coming from the other side of the room.\n\nI spin around, and wouldn’t you know it—another flurry of fast knocks against the glass. I can’t believe it.\n\nI dash back to bed, throw the covers over my head—like that would protect me from whatever this is—and turn on a “How to Better Your Life” podcast, hoping it will drown out the noise. Instead, it seems to amplify it.\n\nEvery time I try to focus on the podcast, the knocks break through, getting louder and louder.\n\nI can hear it clearly, even with the volume cranked up. I must be going crazy.\n\nSchizophrenia usually shows up in your early 20s, right? That checks out. I’m 23, but I don’t have any family history of it. It’s not like I see Barney in a tutu dancing in the corner of my room, so I have no idea.\n\nCould it be the antidepressants? Did I skip a dose? Could that even make you hallucinate? Wait—do sounds even count as hallucinations?\n\nWhat if it’s someone messing with me? But how could they knock so high up without me seeing them? Maybe they’re throwing stones. But how are they throwing them that fast? It makes no sense. I glance at my phone, half-expecting a text or call—maybe a joke from a friend. But nothing.\n\nI let the podcast continue, but again the host’s voice is drowned out by the knocking. I shove my earbuds in, trying to tune out the sound, but it’s no use. It only gets louder. It feels almost…taunting.\n\nThen, just when I think I’ve finally blocked it out, there’s a pause—a heavy silence hanging in the air. For a moment, I feel relieved. Maybe it’s over.\n\n\nBut I literally couldn’t take the suspense anymore. I throw back the covers, my feet hitting the cold floor. I walk toward the window, half-expecting to find a prankster on the other side, someone with a twisted sense of humor.\n\nI reach for the curtain and pull it back, bracing myself for whatever I might find.\n\nBut still, nothing.\n\nJust darkness. Just silence.\n\nSo here I am, back in bed, writing this post because what the hell? Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks.

They looked at each other and started farting and they seemed to be nodding, smiling and seemed interested in whatever fart conversation they were having. There were no words being spoken and then the two guys looked at me. They were farting and they understood the darting, it was clear that it was about me. They started coming closer to me and I could feel this intensity now and I started to run. Then those two guys started to chase and they were both farming.\n\nThen I ended up in some street and i found two other guys who were looking at each other. Their tummies were grumbling at each other and they seemed to be conversing through their grumbling tummies. It was clear that they understood each other and then they turned towards me, with sympathetic looks. Their tummies were grumbling towards me but I didn't understand the language of tummies grumbling. Then those two guys who were conversing through facts had finally found me. They stopped to stare at the tummy rumbling guys. The farting guys were farting to each other as they were conversing, and the tummy rumbling guys were conversing through their grumbling tummies. \n\nI understood none of it and I wondered what they were speaking to each other. Then it seemed the farming guys were the enemies towards the tummy rumbling guys and they were squaring up to each other. For like a moment the farming guys were farting towards each other, and the rumbling guys were tummy grumbling towards each other. Then they started to fight each other and I was just wondering why I was being chased by the farting guys. I really wanted to know the language of farts. \n\nI wonder if they were all talking about me and as these guys were fighting, I was relieved that I was essentially safe now. It was a horrid thought as to what the farting guys would have done to me if they caught me. Then the sneezing and coughing started. The farting guys now had rumbling bellies and the rumbling bellies guys bow had farts, all 4 of them understood each other now. So that's what the farting guys wanted to do with me, they wanted me like them. \n\nThen a gang of people who conversed through coughing started forming and they all understood each other. Then a group of people who were sneezing were also forming and they too had also understood each other.

She placed her back to the wall and sighed in relief after receiving a first-rate scolding by Sensei William Chosen. “‘Don’t steal anything.’ Pfft. Who does he think I am? Some kind of out-of-control kleptomaniac?” she mumbled to herself before peaking over at you with one eye to see if you actually caught her in the act of talking to herself. Her cheeks reddened when she saw that you did indeed hear and see the whole thing. The gig was up. She threw her hands up like “screw it,” and told you, “Screw it. Everyone talks to themselves. Don’t act like you don’t.”\n\nA devious grin crept across her face. She was about to tell you something even crazier but gestured with a finger for you to “wait.” Then she rushed back into the classroom, made a bunch of noise as she bumped into one of the desks, apologized for intruding, yet again, and then apologized for knocking over a stack of papers, quickly grabbed her sword off her desk, and then rushed back out to you. You could hear Wicked Stepmother Susan and Sensei William Chosen loudly castigating her for her actions as they cleaned up her mess. William beat her to the punch and said, “It’s fine! And do not come back in the room to help, or I’ll put you on latrine duty.”\n\n“Great idea! She can start by scrubbing my toilet! Whoever was your last guest made quite an impression, if you know what I mean,” Wicked Stepmother giggled.\n\nLinda smiled at you after stopping herself from going back in there to help clean up the papers she had knocked over. It’s funny how she made that universal expression with her eyes that conveyed her embarrassment and annoyance at the fact that they were in there talking about her. Saying things that were not the slightest bit nice such as who was the worst student between her and Nero. She sighed in relief when Sensei proclaimed that Nero was the most difficult. Relief that only lasted about two seconds. She had to stop herself from howling in disbelief when Wicked Stepmother countered Sensei by saying, “Yeah he might be the worst, but Linda is a blabbermouth.”\n\nLinda glared angrily at you and squeaked out, “I am so not a blabbermouth! Tch! Can you believe those two? At least you understand me. And no, it’s not because you’re not allowed to talk, it’s because—\"\n\nHer flattery was abruptly interrupted by a borderline jump scare from their always deadly always serious Sensei. He leaned out the door and frowned in disappointment when his suspicions were confirmed and because he had snuck up on a fellow ninja. Let’s tackle the first issue. Yup. She was indeed out here in the hall running her mouth instead of doing as instructed. Next, let’s talk about ninja-on-ninja crimes. It was something of an unspoken rule that a true shinobi *never* let their guard down. It was a really bad look for him to be able to sneak up on her like that.\n\n“Sensei. You scared me. It’s not what it—”\n\nHe slammed the door in her face before she could finish saying that universal saying everyone said when they were busted. The sad part about it was that this was probably one of those rare times when someone said, “it’s not what it looks like” and it was true. Because it wasn’t what it looked like! She really wasn’t blabbering! To add insult to injury, he shouted for her to “hurry up” through the door he had just slammed so rudely in her face.\n\nLinda exhaled loudly in frustration before laughing at her own unlucky break. Then after picking up the pieces to her face off the floor after that *terrible* door slam, she took a deep breath in dramatic fashion, turned to you and meekly said, “Sorry.”\n\n[She did this while tapping on the side of the hand carved sheath to her ninja sword. The wiry gold, spiraling serpent patterns s-s-slithered around the rough tooled demon skin leather. The fanged seven-headed reptile started at the top of the case, right under a solid gold locket, before forming into a thin, wispy tail that finished at the bottom, right above the polished, solid gold chape.]()\n\nShe watched you eyeing her weapon with much pride before deciding to say, “I had to go back for it. You probably don’t know this, but it was given to me as a gift after I graduated from ninja academy. It’s not ‘ninja academy.’ I just call it that because ‘Ninja Academy’ sounds like it could be the name of an anime, doesn’t it? Is it the name of an anime? I don’t know, do you?” \n\nShe waited for you to reply and then just shrugged when you didn’t because you obviously couldn’t talk, and she obviously knew you couldn’t. Who knows why she did that. “Anyway. So, yeah. Got this bad boy (her ninja sword), right here, from the Black Church. Their *super* evil. Like take evil and turn the dial on high. Well. Their master told me to never let this thing out of my sight. I don’t know why—hah, I mean I do, *but* it’s not like anyone can use it without suffering a horrible fate—it’s cursed... *but* enough about me—I’m rambling at this point. Who cares about boring stuff like ninjas, the Black Church, haunted blades, and soul sorcery—let’s talk about you! So, how are you doing, buddy? Can I call you that? Or should we keep things boring and stick to ‘Neutral Observer’?”\n\nShe gave you a nudge with her elbow after saying all of that in one breath. You were about to respond to everything she said, but stopped mid gesticulation, when you saw her very odd and sudden gesticulation. She dashed back and did a modified triple pirouette back towards you, only adding to the strangeness and suddenness. Laughter filled the hall as she confessed to learning how to do ballet before learning how “to do ninja.” If her playfulness was unexpected then you were in for a surprise when she went and dialed the crazy up a notch. She waved her hand around like she was showing off the place and then spoke in this bizarre tone like a carnival barker:\n\n“Good evening, Fabulous Reader! Nice to see you again! I’m sure you know my name, but I’ll tell you anyway! Hi! I’m Linda Nancy Landbird, and today I’ll be your tour guide as we walk around the super terrific Báthoric Historic Vampiric Demonic estate! Ecstatic? No not really? Fantastic! Because after I show you around you will be! Oh, and you can call me Nancy. Linda is fine too. Just don’t call me that in front of my mother. Her first name is Linda too. It’s a vampire thing. Very confusing, I know, but like I said don’t worry everything’s marvelous. While we’re on the topic of marvelous things, I must say, you look *marvelous* today! Oh, Wise Reader, it’s so great to be friends with someone who knows *when* to put on airs.”\n\nShe hopped back about one step away from you and waved her hand around in a sweeping arc. “Okay. So we are currently standing in the ‘Blood Hall.’ No idea why they call it that. Huh? I guess it’s a vampire thing. You know. To attach ‘blood’ to as many things as possible because it sounds cool even though it really doesn’t when you think about it but whatever—whatever we’re not here for that—we’re here to show you around.” She paused for a second and placed her hand under her chin to think before pointing at the wall behind you. “Hmm. Okay. So, behind you is the southern wall, which also happens to be the very back of the manor. Outside that door is the back lawn and northern aqueduct arch. Try not to get mad, but Sensei only gave us like thirty-minutes, so I’ll have to skip a few things. But yeah. If you look outside that window, you should be able to see what I’m talking about. But don’t worry, you’ll get to see it when we go back there to meet up with the squad. Am I talking too fast? I tend to do that. That or ramble off subject. But no. I am certainly not a ‘blabbermouth!’ I still can’t believe they said that about me—\"\n\nShe abruptly stopped talking, spun around towards you, and started skipping and dancing down the hall like a pop star. She suggested that you should follow her with a very suggestive grin. Her airy voice bounced off the walls of the hall like a fairy as she sang, “Let’s see. We’ll skip the second floor because it’s *boring!* Hah! I’m sure we can make it a part two or three after you fall in love with my tour guiding skills. Oh, and I have no clue what the square footage is so don’t bother asking. Oh, and the mansion has two floors *plussss* a really large attic. Oh, but I guess then that would be three floors, huh? Pfft. Whatever. I ain’t no architect.”\n\nShe pointed way back down at the door of the room Sensei had slammed in her face not too long ago and then said rather cheerfully, “Almost forgot. The room where we *just* had our super boring orientation. Yeah. That room—it’s called a parlor. Very nice. It has a full bar, which I can’t use because I’m only 16, unless they server *Coca-Colas! Yay!* Eh. There’s a bunch of antique cabinets, which look nice, and that sweet violin behind the glass, which—Oh my God! If only I could get my hands on that thing... er, I mean, you know. Not to fence or anything! Just to hold like a... baby. Never mind that sounds stupid,” she snorted before changing the subject. “Just past the parlor is the countess’ office and then the Blood Hall we are currently standing it.”\n\nLinda skipped a few paces forward and waited for you to catch up before leaving you behind once again as she dashed into the doorless room to your right. Inside the first thing you noticed was the large oil painting that was encased in a gold frame. It was a grandiose self portrait of Annemarie’s third great grandmother, the infamous Countess Elizabeth Báthory.\n\nApparently, she was the progenitor of their clan. She also had a terrible history of luring young maidens to her castle with the promise of finishing school only to finish their souls by stealing their blood in a cruel prolonged affair that selfishly fortify her vitality. It’s also how she became a vampire. Her cruelty was legendary and piqued the interest of the fallen angels who decided to make her a part of their extended family. How they turned sadistic humans like her and Vlad the Impaler into vampires was a trade secret no one knew.\n\nNext to the painting were two busts of Annemarie’s late mother and father who were slain by an assassin from the Dark Order. The sculptures were hand carved from marble and sat atop stone plinths that had an antique finish. The last portrait on that side of the room belonged to her dead grandfather. Something about the artwork other than its flamboyance caught your eye. The vampire in the picture shared a striking resemblance to Lestat from *The Vampire Chronicles.*\n\n“I don’t know if you know this, but the Báthory clan is the second oldest bloodline. The Dracul bloodline being the first. Both are super strong, but you don’t want to be a member because they’re always fighting each other. It’s ridiculous. I have no idea how we’re going to destroy the world when we can’t even get them to stop destroying each other,” Linda kindly explained to you.\n\nThrough another doorless entryway was the antechamber, which connected to the Grand Saloon. Adjoined to the portrait room was the fitness room. It was a sizeable area with an indoor pool, weight room, cardio area, and two small locker rooms. The antechamber was decked out in Victorian décor, which was thoroughly represented throughout the main floor. Yeah. It was beautiful, but only in a “this is how I imagine every rich vampire styles their home” kind of beautiful. So much so that you began to wonder if there was some kind of propaganda pamphlet that went out to all the vampire aristocrats that screamed “Victorian” is the only home fashion.\n\n[**\\[Nero 03: Q&amp;A\\]**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RingocrossStories\/s\/b64YrwA3Ol)\n\n**\\[Nero 05: Tour Guide P2\\]**"},"200":{"title":"dennys after hours is wild","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqszr8\/dennys_after_hours_is_wild\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Infinite-Ostrich8245","selftext":"Jess sat at the back of the Denny’s, flipping through applications for new hires. Her eyes glazed over as she skimmed through the names—nothing too exciting. That was, until she paused on one. \\*Grant.\\* The name felt oddly familiar, tugging at something in the back of her mind. She squinted at the name for a moment, but eventually shrugged it off and tossed the application aside.\n\n\n\n“Another one,” she muttered, her fingers tracing the edges of the paper absentmindedly.\n\n\n\nThe night had grown quiet, unusually so. It was nearing midnight, and the usual late-night crowd had thinned out earlier than usual. Outside, the rain drummed against the windows, casting watery shadows that rippled across the floor. Jess let out a long sigh, rubbing her temples. Something about the air tonight felt heavy, oppressive, as if the dark itself had crept into the restaurant, filling the spaces between every table, every booth, every breath.\n\n\n\nShe stood up, feeling a chill run down her spine. The diner was empty now, save for the low hum of the fluorescent lights above her. She walked out from the back office and glanced around the dining area, her footsteps echoing strangely in the stillness.\n\n\n\nThat’s when she saw him.\n\n\n\nSitting at one of the corner booths was a man, impossibly tall and thin, dressed in a dusty, old-fashioned suit. His skin was pale, almost translucent, stretched tightly over bones that seemed to jut out at odd angles. But it wasn’t his height, or his hollowed cheeks that made her heart pound in her chest. It was his smile.\n\n\n\nHis mouth stretched impossibly wide, curling at the corners in a grotesque grin that seemed to eat up half his face. His lips were thin and cracked, yet his teeth were perfectly white—rows of them, sharp and unnervingly clean, like they had been polished for the occasion. Atop his head sat an old top hat, crooked and worn, casting a shadow over his sunken eyes. He looked like something out of a nightmare, a caricature of a man.\n\n\n\n\"Good evening, Jess,\" he said, his voice oily and dripping with a false cheerfulness. The way he spoke her name made her stomach churn.\n\n\n\n“I’m sorry, we’re closed,” Jess stammered, stepping back toward the counter. Her hand instinctively went to her phone in her apron pocket, but when she felt for it, it wasn’t there. She had left it in the office. Her pulse quickened as the man stood up, his movements unnaturally fluid, as though his bones had no joints. He was too tall, far too tall, his head nearly brushing the ceiling as he began to walk toward her.\n\n\n\n“Oh, don’t be like that,” he teased, his voice silky and sweet. \"It’s rude not to entertain guests, especially when they’ve come so far to see you.\"\n\n\n\nJess’s mouth went dry. “Who are you?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\n\nThe man chuckled, a low, rumbling sound that sent a shiver down her spine. He tipped his hat in an exaggerated, theatrical motion. “Mr. Smile, at your service.” He grinned wider, if that was even possible, his eyes gleaming with dark amusement. “And my, oh my, Jess... you’ve been quite the busy bee tonight, haven’t you?”\n\n\n\nShe backed up further, her heart racing. \"I don’t know what you’re talking about.\"\n\n\n\n“Oh, but you do,” Mr. Smile said, his voice dropping into a soft, almost conspiratorial tone. “You’ve been flipping through those little applications, haven’t you? But you missed something. Something important.”\n\n\n\nHe was closer now, looming over her, his breath cold against her skin. Jess swallowed hard, her back pressed against the counter. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n\nMr. Smile’s grin widened, his eyes narrowing into slits. “I like to play with my food before I eat. And I think you’ll be particularly fun.”\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the lights flickered, and the entire restaurant seemed to warp, the shadows stretching longer and twisting unnaturally. The walls felt like they were closing in, the air thickening with every breath. The tables, the chairs—they all seemed to grow taller, misshapen, as if reality itself was bending around them.\n\n\n\nJess’s heart pounded in her chest as she darted to the back, but no matter how fast she moved, the door to the kitchen seemed impossibly far away. Behind her, Mr. Smile’s voice floated through the air, teasing, playful. “You can’t run from me, Jess. I always catch my prey.”\n\n\n\nHer hands fumbled for the handle, but it wouldn’t budge. Panic set in as she heard the soft tap of his footsteps behind her. She spun around, her breath caught in her throat as she saw him, standing impossibly close, his grin wider than ever.\n\n\n\n“You’ll learn to smile, Jess,” he whispered, his breath cold and rancid. “Everyone does, eventually.”\n\n\n\nWith a swift, horrifying motion, his arm elongated, stretching out like rubber until his bony fingers were wrapped around her throat. His grip was ice-cold, freezing her to the spot, her breath trapped in her chest. His face loomed closer, the grotesque smile never faltering, his eyes boring into hers with a malevolent gleam.\n\n\n\n“I always save the best for last,” he murmured, his voice a sickening lullaby.\n\n\n\nJess gasped for air, struggling against his grip, but it was like trying to fight against a nightmare—everything felt wrong, unreal. The walls of the diner seemed to bend and warp, the floor tilting beneath her feet. The world spun as her vision began to blur, the edges of her sight turning black.\n\n\n\nAnd then, with one final, mocking laugh, everything went dark.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nWhen the morning shift arrived, they found the diner just as it had been the night before—empty, save for one small detail.\n\n\n\nThe name \"Jess\" was scratched into the counter, deep and jagged, as though carved by something far more sinister than any human hand.\n\n\n\nNo one ever found her.\n\n"},"201":{"title":"Red Sweater","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqtkum\/red_sweater\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Braden_Crispy","selftext":"Her name was Violet Simmons, and if you walked by her in the hallways of Brookwood High, you wouldn’t have noticed her. She was the kind of girl that blended into the background. No friends, no enemies—just invisible. Violet was seventeen, with pale skin that seemed to reflect the school’s fluorescent lights. Her long black hair fell like a curtain, always hiding her face. People said her eyes were dull, like a washed-out grey, and she rarely spoke. She was a shadow, always present but never seen.\n\nViolet’s appearance was plain. She didn’t care about makeup, and her clothes were always the same: an old, oversized red sweater she wore almost every day, like a security blanket. It hung loosely off her thin frame, and even in the hottest months of summer, she never took it off. People noticed it, but no one ever asked her why she wore it.\n\nShe had learned how to make herself disappear over the years. Invisibility was her power. When you’ve been ignored for so long, you start to crave it. The ability to observe, to watch without being watched—it gave her a twisted sense of control. And Violet had been planning something. Something dark, and no one ever saw it coming.\n\n\n---\n\nIt was late September when things began to shift. The day started like any other—classes dragging on in the suffocating heat of the school. Violet sat in the back of Mrs. Olsen’s History class, taking in the room like a predator in a cage.\n\nIn the front row sat Emma Collins, the popular girl who was everything Violet wasn’t. Blonde, beautiful, and cruel in that effortless way. Emma didn’t even know Violet existed, except when she pushed past her in the halls or snickered with her friends. But Violet noticed everything about her. She watched how Emma commanded attention with a flick of her hair or a roll of her eyes. It made Violet’s stomach churn with something she couldn’t name. Maybe it was jealousy. Or maybe it was something darker.\n\nThere was Max Green, the loud jock with the booming laugh that echoed down the hallways. Max was the center of attention in every room, especially since he was dating Emma. He walked around like he owned the school, and maybe in a way, he did. People like Max and Emma always did.\n\nThen there was Sam Miller, the loner kid who sat two seats ahead of Violet. Sam didn’t belong to any group either, but unlike Violet, he still drew attention—mostly from bullies like Max. Sam was the quiet type, always reading some horror novel with frayed pages. Violet had thought, once or twice, that they might have something in common, but she knew better than to reach out.\n\nNone of them knew what was coming.\n\n\n---\n\nViolet didn’t start out evil. She hadn’t always been this way. It was the world that made her cruel. It started when she was younger, living in a home that was more warzone than sanctuary. Her parents fought every night—screaming, breaking things. Her mother took pills to escape; her father drank to forget. Violet had tried to reach out, to get someone to notice, but no one ever did. Teachers would ask if she was okay, but they didn’t really care about the answer. After a while, she stopped trying.\n\nBy the time she was fourteen, Violet had already begun fantasizing about death. It wasn’t a sudden thing. It grew slowly, like a weed in the back of her mind. She started with animals—stray cats that wandered into her yard, rabbits she found in the woods behind her house. It was easy to hurt them, to make them stop moving. It gave her a sense of control, the kind she never had in her own life.\n\n\n---\n\nThe first human she killed was Emma.\n\nIt had taken weeks of planning. Violet watched Emma, learning her routine like a twisted stalker. Emma always stayed late on Thursdays, hanging around the gym after cheerleading practice. Violet knew this because she had followed her every single time. No one ever noticed the girl in the red sweater lingering near the doors.\n\nOne Thursday, Violet made her move. She waited until the gym was empty and the parking lot deserted. Emma was on her phone, laughing at something on TikTok, completely unaware of the danger behind her. Violet had slipped on a pair of latex gloves, her hands trembling with excitement and fear. She grabbed a length of wire she had hidden in her pocket, moving silently behind Emma.\n\nIn one swift motion, she wrapped the wire around Emma’s throat, pulling it tight. The phone dropped to the ground with a loud crack, and Emma’s hands flew up, clawing at her neck, trying to scream. Violet tightened her grip, her arms shaking with the effort, but her face was expressionless. Emma’s body jerked and convulsed, but eventually, it went still.\n\nViolet dragged her body behind the gym, dumping it in the shadows near the dumpsters. No one would find her until the next morning.\n\n\n---\n\nWhen Emma’s body was discovered, the school went into a panic. Cops swarmed the hallways, interviewing students, questioning teachers, and searching for clues. Violet kept her head down, blending into the background like she always had. She overheard Max talking to his friends, his voice cracking as he tried to hide his fear. He was devastated, but Violet felt nothing.\n\nThe fear in the school was intoxicating. For the first time in her life, Violet felt like she had power. Real power. And it wasn’t enough.\n\n\n---\n\nMax was next.\n\nHe had been a part of Emma’s world, and in Violet’s mind, that made him just as guilty. She didn’t care that he was grieving, that his world had fallen apart. To her, Max represented everything she hated about people like Emma—selfish, cruel, and blind to the pain of others.\n\nOne night, after football practice, Violet followed him. He was alone, his usual group of friends having gone home early. Violet waited until he reached the parking lot, her heart pounding in her chest. She approached him from behind, gripping a crowbar she had taken from her father’s shed.\n\n“Max,” she called softly.\n\nHe turned, confused at first, his face scrunched in disbelief as he saw the quiet girl in the red sweater. “What the hell do you want?”\n\nWithout answering, Violet swung the crowbar. The first hit cracked his knee, sending him crumpling to the ground with a scream. She didn’t stop. She swung again, this time hitting his ribs, then his head. Blood splattered across the pavement, and Max stopped moving. Violet stood over his body, her hands shaking as she looked at what she had done.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\n\n---\n\nThe police never suspected Violet. How could they? She was the quiet, invisible girl. The one no one noticed. The deaths were chalked up to random violence, a “killer on the loose,” but no one thought it was a student. No one thought it could be the girl they passed every day in the halls.\n\nBut Sam did.\n\nViolet hadn’t planned on Sam figuring it out. He was smarter than she gave him credit for. Sam had seen her leaving the gym the night Emma died. He hadn’t said anything at first, but the more bodies that turned up, the more he watched her. He knew.\n\nOne day, after school, Sam approached her in the library, his face pale and his hands trembling. “It’s you, isn’t it?” he whispered.\n\nViolet didn’t deny it. There was no point. She just smiled, a cold, empty smile. Sam’s eyes widened in fear.\n\n“What are you going to do?” he asked, his voice shaking.\n\nViolet leaned in close, her grey eyes locking onto his. “You’ll see,” she whispered.\n\n\n---\n\nSam never made it home that night.\n\n\n---\n\nCharacter List\n\nViolet Simmons\n\nAge: 17\n\nAppearance: Pale skin, long black hair, grey, dull eyes, and always wears an oversized red sweater.\n\nPersonality: Quiet, invisible, and deeply disturbed.

Never did I think I’d be blind and deaf and forced to type my stories of what lead me here through a typewriter laid with braille and yet here I am. It never would’ve been this way, at least if I never approached her or heeded her desperate groans. I find comfort knowing that never again I will have to lay my eyes, the eyes she stole from me, upon her wretched form. My name is Euler F. Bradenpitten and this is my story of what happened on the night of June 2nd, 1968.\n\nI had woken up in my room like any other morning, as my father came in and started beating me with an engine belt. My father was an old wicked man, a mechanic by trade with a foul temper and drunkard who often turned his anger towards my mother and I. I was not sure what I had done to invoke his rage that day, but I ran out of the house, still in my ragged and dirty pajamas. I was too scared to return home, so I wasted hours away walking the streets with nowhere to go. However my brief respite from his drunken fury was interrupted by the sun’s departure below the horizon. I knew I couldn’t return home, especially with how my father reacted to my return after fleeing the house the previous time I ran away to escape his brutal onslaught. I had decided I’d need to find somewhere to rest for the night and recuperate. Judge me if you may, it does not matter to me anymore, but I had heard that a local woman had died in her house a night prior and figured I’d scope it out and attempt to rest for the night inside. I know breaking into the home of a recently deceased woman is something many people would scowl at and be quick to shame me for. I regret it, I really do, but I was young and desperate and the circumstances clouded not just my judgment but also morality. Ultimately I paid the price.\n\nEntering was easy, my young nimble fingers were rather used to picking locks as my father taught me how to at a young age in order to assist him in scrapping abandoned cars for parts. He would have me pick the locks as his fingers were too large and clunky to make quick progress and he wasn’t too fond of breaking windows and admittedly I was too cowardly to do it myself. As I opened the door my nose was greeted with the slight smell of death and cleaning chemicals but a quick search of the house showed that nobody was present. The house was rather nice, certainly better than any home I lived in, but I knew I couldn’t stay long so I did my best to not grow fond of the place. I decided on sleeping in one of the bedrooms as the sun’s warm light was snuffed out by the darkness of that warm summer night, but by that time had conjured up a voracious appetite. I checked the kitchen for any remaining food and luckily it seems the pantries were yet to be cleared out. With every morsel of food I engorged myself on, I felt immense guilt. I was desperate, but I was still an uninvited guest in a dead woman's home feasting on her food. \n\nFrom the darkness outside the home, I had heard her. For the first time I had heard her and dear god I wish I never left the house to follow her. It was the groans of a woman, she reminded me of my late grandmother who withered away from various diseases in her old age. I felt obligated to check on whoever was making the noise because for all I knew it was an elderly woman in need, possibly gone senile and lost after venturing away from home. I was wrong, it was so much more grim. I walked into the night venturing towards the noise calling out to the woman. “Hello? I mean no harm, are you hurt? Where are you?”. I was met with no response other than more groaning which I followed. “Hello?” I called out again, “Ma'am do you need help? Why are you out here alone so late? I can help you if you’re lost”. Nothing but more groans followed. I assumed she was hurt so I braced myself to find her wounded but… when I finally saw her, and she sensed my presence drawing near, I knew I had made a grim mistake. It was as if the moon was illuminating her, or maybe she was bending the will of the moon's light in her favor, but I immediately realized who she was. She was the woman who had died. She was *Helen Keller*. She spoke nothing to me because she did not hear me, she looked beyond me for she could not see me, she only knew I was present. Her skin lay loosely upon her body, cold and clammy, her eyes pale and crusted over, a stench of death enveloping the area sent my mind into a stunned state. Then it happened, she glided towards me as if a specter in the tales my mother told me in my younger years, and slowly raised her hands towards my face. I wanted to run, I wanted to scream, I wanted to be back in my home and wish I had suffered the wrath of my father rather than be in the presence of her. Her fingers wet and rotting danced across my face, feeling it out until they found my eyes, she gently caressed them and felt my moist tears. I did not know what to expect, but I wasn't anticipating her ripping them out. Through the mind shattering pain I could not think or plead but only yell and scream, then she went for my ears. Her fingers winded through the canals effortlessly then proceeded to rip out my ear drums, and after she finished she allowed me to fall to the ground and I finally went unconscious from the pain. When I awoke I did not know what time it was but it was certainly morning. I felt the warmth of the sun on my skin and crusted blood around my eyes and ears. I could not see or hear and I was too lightheaded from the blood loss to stand up straight yet I was still able to call, or so it felt like I was calling. I yelled and screamed not knowing if my voice was even forming words but I went until I couldn’t make any noise. That's when I felt 2 hands grabbing me, neither in a harsh or malicious way yet I was still traumatized and in a state of utter shock and fear so I jolted back at the sensation. After a few moments the hand grabbed mine and I decided I was going to have to trust whoever it was would help me, and luckily they did. I was later informed it was a nurse named Winnie Corbally who had found me. She was Miss Keller’s companion and was at the house to clean up and pack up her personal belongings, but after hearing my desperate screams and cries behind Miss Keller's house ran to my aid. I never told this version of the story before, hell why would I? They’d think I was crazy, send me away to some facility with the mentally ill, and though I was scared of her coming back to hurt me again, I figured I'd much rather die to her than waste away in one of those hell holes they call asylums. Maybe this was all deserved for my disrespectful actions towards her estate that night, maybe her spirit was so upset by my brazen ways that she wanted to punish me. I suppose I deserve this fate of being blind to the world I once viewed through beautiful colors and shapes and being deaf to the melodies and sounds that blessed my ears, don’t I? \n\n"},"204":{"title":"Honey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fq9f51\/honey\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"GeneralP123","selftext":"We all have our favorite meal, some people like a simple healthy salad, others enjoy a cheesy pizza.\n\nI am a massive steak fan, but for it to suit my taste it has to be prepared in a specific way.\n\nYou see the trick is to let the meat marinate in honey for quite some time before serving it.\n\nSucculent meat combined with sweet honey, there's nothing tastier in this world.\n\nSome steak connoisseurs prefer dry aged meat, but I enjoy it the most when the meat is younger as long as it's marinated in all natural honey.\n\nNatural honey is absolutely necessary when preparing this incredible meal, if you use the fake honey they sell in supermarkets, you're gonna end up with a far inferior steak.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather throw something like that away.\n \nFortunately for me, I know exactly where to acquire honey of the highest possible quality.\n\nI go to the local bazaar every weekend, as soon as I get there the honey seller I trust the most waves at me, knowing that I'm not leaving the bazaar without at least ten jars of his honey.\n\nAlbert is an older gentleman, probably in his seventies, he's easy to recognize, you can't miss his gray beard and friendly smile even from a mile away.\n\nHe's been a beekeeper for almost forty-five years, there's dozens of honey sellers at the bazaar, but none of them have the amount of experience he has, that is very noticeable when you try the honey he sells.\n\nHe's a hard-working man that seemingly never misses a day at work, during the coldest days of winter I'd still find old Albert at the bazaar, while I'm wearing my scarf and my leather gloves, Albert is dressed almost like it's spring time, If I ask him if he's cold, He'd just crack a joke and say \"Don't worry, the bees keep me warm!\".\n\nWhen I first met Albert, he shook my hand and gave me a small jar of honey, he looked me straight in the eyes and said \"First one's free, I'll be surprised if you don't come back for more after trying my honey, it's organic and unfiltered, I like to think the price isn't too bad either.\"\n\nAs soon as I tried Albert's honey, I was hooked. One small jar with an \"Old Bear's Honey\" sticker plastered on it was all that it took to turn me into a regular customer of his. \n\nOrganic and unfiltered, exactly as Albert said, perfect for turning your regular steak into a five star restaurant quality dish.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I loved Albert's honey, I'll have to find a new supplier soon.\n\nEleven children went missing in my town last week, they were aged from six to ten years old and the police logically assumed a serial kidnapper was on the loose. \n\nThe search for the missing children lasted only two days before the police found one of them.\n\nThe child was a seven year old boy, he was found dead in the local park, his nose and mouth were taped shut and large amounts of honey were injected into his nose. \n\nThe police immediately researched the nearby area and found a vital piece of evidence in a garbage can. \n\nInside the garbage can was an empty honey jar, even though the sticker on the jar was scratched off almost completely, they quickly found out who the jar belonged to.\n\nAlbert was arrested soon after, the fingerprints found on the jar of honey at the crime scene were a perfect match to Albert's.\n\nDuring questioning the old man had a stroke, which in return left him in a comatose state. \n\nThe police are hopeful Albert will wake up from the coma, because he's currently the only person that can lead them to the rest of the missing children, or so they think.\n\nYou probably want to know what I think about all of this, right?\n\nHonestly, I'm just glad I stocked up on honey while Albert was still selling it. \n\nIf I hadn't stocked up on honey, I wouldn't be able to feed the kids properly and then their flesh would taste just like regular old steak. \n\nTheir diet consists of only honey and water, three times a day. \n\nIf I included anything else in their diet, the meat wouldn't taste as good, believe me I've tried.\n\nThe younglings seem to be enjoying their stay at my basement for now, if you don't pay attention to the never-ending screaming and begging. \n\nI'm getting hungry, so before I go grab a sweet and savory snack, I'll tell you how you can tell when the meat is ready for the grill!\n\nIt's simple, as soon as the skin and eyes get a yellowish hue, you know the meat is ready to go!\n\nI'm very excited, I checked up on the kids about an hour ago and the youngest of them, a girl which thanks to the police I now know is six years old is definitely ready for the grill, her eyes have that sweet golden color now. \n\nI'll sharpen my knife and go get her in five minutes, here's a fun fact before I go.\n\nI only realized what the names and the ages of the kids were because of the police.\n\nI must admit I never asked the children for their names, I didn't even talk to them.\n\nThat's only natural, right? \n\nI'm sure you don't talk to your dinner before eating it."},"205":{"title":"Frykondula (4\/?)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqc5mq\/frykondula_4\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Primajuana","selftext":"**Another Morning**\n\nIt was a little after noon the next day. Ray and I completely neglected to do anything of worth up until that point. We wasted our morning on A Perfect Circle’s Thirteenth Step and yet another vain attempt at completing all of Halo 2’s campaign on legendary. It was at some point in the middle of our umpteenth attempt on some mission halfway through the game that the kitchen counter vibrated with life. The home phone chirped, it’s rubber buttons and screen glowed green. \n\nHaving had just exploded in a of fury pixelated plasma, I let slip the controller from my hands onto the couch cushion and said to Ray, “Don’t worry I got it.”\n\n“I’ll just wait for you to get back.” Ray said over his shoulder before hitting pause on an identical controller that he was holding. \n \nRushing to the counter anxious to return to the couch, I snatched up the phone and read the number listed, it was Biggie. I answered it. \n\n“wazzzzzup.”\n\nBiggie responded, “wazzzzzup. Yo, what’re you guys doing today?”\n\n“Nothing really.” I said with a careless inflection. \n\n“Sweet. You should swing by as soon as I get off.” E’s voice sounded out from the device. \n\n“Sure, is there anything going on?”\n\n“No, it’s this journal.” Biggie’s amazement began to creep into his cadence. He asked me, “Have you read it?”\n\nI responded, “I mean, some.” \n\n“Dude, I’ve been reading this nonstop since I got it. It’s absolutely insane.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked him, the thoughts laid to rest just last night waking in my mind. \n\n“I’ll just show you when you guys come over.”\n\n“Sounds fair.” I asked, “When are you off?”\n\n“I should be getting off.” He trailed off, looking around for a clock I presumed. “In about two hours.” \n\n“Alright, we’ll see you there.” I hung up the phone a little too quick and returned it to the charging dock. \n\nBack inside of Ray’s room, stepping over the back of the couch, I returned to the floral cushion I’d been ripped away from.\n\n“Yo, you think we can finish this in two hours?” I asked Ray.\n\n“Uh, I don’t know. Why?”\n\nI cut the fat off of mine and E’s phone conversation, “E says he wants us to swing by later today. Says it’s about the journal.”\n\n“Oh okay. We can do that.”\n\n“Alright cool.” I said before following the statement in a mock tone, “Then go ahead and load that mofo up, beotch.”\n\nRay chuckled and unpaused the game, “Whatever.”\n\nWhen 3pm finally came around, we loaded in the suburban and made our way to E’s.\n\n**Reading and Interpretation**\n\nInside of Biggie’s room, I noticed that the city of lego was returned to the tote and the furniture was back to its proper place. I also noticed that the atmosphere was unlike anything it had been like before. There were no young men laughing or shouting at the other one, shoulders colliding as they sit crisscrossed beside each other, attention thrust headlong into some racing or fighting game. There was no one standing by the window attempting to conceal a cough, bellowing out plumes of white, praying to god the stench of marijuana wouldn’t stick to them. There were no slouching frames on either tier of the double decker couch, lazily extending their arm out with remote in hand, listlessly switching from channel to channel. \nNo, instead there was a seriousness about the room that seemed to infect those who entered. E was standing by the window, but instead of bellowing and praying he had Odor’s journal in hand. Leaning against the window frame, he was reviewing and reading the diary. Something I imagined he’d been doing all day. E was alone in his room. Not terribly unusual, it was just a rare occurrence not to see Yuri or one of our other friends there with him. \n\nThe journal he was holding was heavily annotated. There were neon sticky notes jutting out from the sides and tops of several pages, little strings of letters and ink scrawled onto each. \n\n“Oh, hey guys.” Biggie muttered under his breath, still putting things together in his brain.\n\nAfter the initial greeting, he continued his thinking as if we weren’t even there. It was as if we were invisible to him. \n\nWaiting a minute in awkward silence for E to initiate the conversation, I finally reminded him, “You said over the phone that you wanted to tell us something?”\n\nE jumped out of his mind and back into the present moment, “Right. Right.” He sighed, “This is a lot. So I’m not gunna waste anytime and just jump right into it.”\nHe finally met our eyes then began his litany of speculative thought, “To start, there is a very slim chance that Odor may have killed himself and that the girl’s disappearance is in fact just a huge coincidence.” Biggie pinched one of the sticky notes attached the edge of a page then carefully flipped to said page before continuing the thought, “He writes often about suicide. Writing, ‘My end is fast at hand. I fear it much. Long days of thinking, I know them well. The walls of my mind I try to keep them sound. Yet, they continue to crumble.’”\n\nBig E read from the college-ruled notebook like a lectionary, vocalizing blurbs of scripture that might collectively bring about some sort of inner clarity.\n\n“He also wrote this too.” Biggie thumbed to a different page then read out loud, “‘I will never know peace in my lifetime, I think often of the self-slain Judas and of ending my own life.’”\nBiggie paused, “While extremely ‘on the nose’, it’s hard to know if it’s related to his disappearance, I mean, a lot of this is just his diary. Even so, while there’s reason to believe he may have killed himself, if he did, I think it’s highly unlikely that he also killed the mystery girl.”\n\nThe atmosphere didn’t change much with this information, it was still just as stale and sterile and awkward. All three of us stood cemented in place.\n\n“Odor mentions a girl, a ‘Her’ quite often. Sometimes she’s an idea. At other times, she’s someone he went to high school with. It’s written as if he’s talking about two different women. He refers to their love cut short as ‘abortion’. In fact, it’s something he was quite afraid of. I believe the two were dating. The way he writes about mystery girl has me thinking that he’d never lay a finger on her, no matter how depressed or angry at the world he may have been.”\nBiggie cleared his throat before divulging more, “The confusing part is that they both went missing at the same time.”\n\nRay interjected the sermonette with a question, “What so they had some sort of suicide pact?”\n\n“Not quite.” Biggie turned his attention from Ray to me, asking, “Remember how your brother said Odor and his girlfriend went missing at Green Oak?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Well look at this.” Biggie flipped to the section I tried piecing together a few days ago on the car ride home, the one with the newspaper clippings and missing person posters. “All of these people. All of them were reported missing during a camping trip in the same national park.”\nHe unfolded a piece of paper tucked between the pages, a list of names and dates and ages he had put together. “The disappearances span about half a decade or so before Odor’s own. An equal amount of men and women. Aged anywhere between seventeen and twenty-four. They went missing in pairs despite some of the persons having no association with the other.”\nHe closed the creased piece of paper and continued, “If these are at all tied to the disappearance of Odor and that mystery girl then something else is definitely going on here.”\n\nI asked, “Like what?”\n\n“I’m not sure. But it’s apparent Odor was afraid of someone, something else.” E again filling the role of preacher flicked about his gospel book, then read aloud, “‘They must come back. They must come back. If in them there is found an innuendo they will kill me. Their damnable dogma, why can I not write of anything? By what am I barred other than fear of they that know. I want to express this thing that I found but am told to not.’”\n\nBefore E could read any following passages, I interrupted, “Wait, wait, wait.” My brain began to fire off about something I had heard. “That reminds me of one of the parts in that first CD we found. How did it go?” \nI cast a pail and reached deep into the well of memory. “‘Talk like a fool. Call it defiance. Several thoughts’ then he says something about not being able to keep silent.” I finished the half ass quote. “Could he be referring to the same thing, you think?”\n\n“More than likely.” Biggie assured before reaching his own hand into the well of my memory, “What else do you remember from the CD? Could you make out any other lyrics.”\n\n“Um.” I thought long before answering. “He said something about rings. Other than that I don’t remember.”\n\n“Rings. Rings. That’s another thing.” E got visibly excited. “He talks about marriage and rings and ceremonies a lot. However, in a photo marked ‘The Insiders’ he’s not seen wearing anything on his ring finger that might suggest he is married by law. He is wearing a silver band on his index finger, maybe he’s referring to that?” E sighed, “Regardless, rings for whatever reason are important.”\n\n“How do you know that’s him in the photo?” Ray asked.\n\n“He wrote ‘Me’ under himself.” E answered Ray then changed the subject by pointing out a blank space on the reverse side of the page. “There is an ‘Outsider’ but it looks like Odor ripped the photo out.”\n\nThe others eyed the vacant space curiously while I tried not to look guilty about it.\n\nRay piped up, “What about water stuff?”\n\nIt took me a moment to realize why that might be important to bring up, once I remembered I interjected, “Oh yeah, we were listening to the other CD and Odor seems to mention water a lot.”\n\n“Water?” E thought to himself before making work of the journal, flipping to several different sections. He muttered under his breath, “‘A ring of blue surrounds their ceremony’.”  He flipped through a few pages then again muttered under his breath, “‘She drinks and smiles.’” He continued to flip through the notebook before shutting it and addressing us, “I mean, there are a few mentions of water but I wasn’t keeping tabs.”\n\nWe sat in a long uncomfortable silence, the kind of silence we knew that only Yuri was capable of. We were all thinking. Ray scratched his chin. I bit my nails. Biggie looked over his notes. To an observer, we probably looked like one of those paintings of Socrates or Plato surrounded by their pondering pupils. Instead, we surrounded no one. \n\n“What do we make of all of this? A bizarrely cryptic local musician takes his girlfriend out on a hiking trip, they get lost then starve same as a handful of couples had before them.” I looked to Biggie and asked, “That sound about right?” \n\n“I mean, that is a possibility but I think there’s more going on than just that. The CDs are more than just Odor’s pet project. I think they’re a warning or map of some kind. Odor is trying to tell us something.”\n\nI asked, “Well then what he is trying to say?” \n\n“I don’t know. I told you everything I figured out thus far. I can keep looking into the journal and see if I missed anything but your best bet is visiting those woods. Maybe talk to a park ranger or something, see what you can find out.”\n\nRay eyed me apprehensively. I could tell he didn’t like the idea of poking around Green Oak. But just like with Odor’s old house, I knew he’d put up a fight at first then wind up going anyways. He was predictable like that. \n\n“Alright.” I then said the words Ray was hoping I wouldn’t, “We’ll go. We’ll have a look around and see if we can’t find anything.”\n\n“Good.” E turned and pressed his shoulder against the window frame, leaning and looking out the window just as he had been doing when we walked in. “If you guys don’t mind, I’m gunna keep reading this over.”\n\nRay and I didn’t put up a fight, we left.\n\nAs the suburban rolled out of Biggie’s driveway Ray finally verbalized his reluctance, “Man, I don’t know if I want to go.”\n\nMy eyes were turned out towards the houses that stared back, house after house after house until we hit town.\n\nI assured him, already having expected Ray to try and back out, “Look. I know you’re nervous but I promise we’ll be okay. I doubt we will find anything. Those woods are massive, I doubt we will even get close to where Odor and them were camping at. Just see this as us getting some much needed fresh air.”\n\nRay responded, no doubt after having searched his mind for viable excuses and finding none, “You’re right.”\n\nI tried easing Ray’s mind with a proposal, “Here’s what we will do. We’ll swing by my place. I’ll grab the rest of my ganj, I’ll run to the barn see if I can’t find any of my dads old camping stuff, we’ll head back to your place, get stoned as fuck then finish Halo on legendary or watch something on Newgrounds. Sound good?” \n\nI hoped that a marijuana-induced stupor would loosen Ray up a bit, and to be quite frank I was jonesing for a fix myself.\n\n“Yeah. That sounds good.” Ray said, focused on the road.\n\n**Mother, Veronica**\n\nIt was somewhere around 4pm. It was my mother’s off day. I knew entering the home at this time only to immediately leave again would result in hell. \n\nThe asphalt crunched beneath the tires as the suburban crawled to a stop in my driveway.\n\nRay began to unbuckle his seatbelt until I objected, saying, “Just me. I’ll be in an’ out.”\n\nI’m not sure Ray was clued in on what was happening in my home life, I imagine he had a faint idea. We’d ask each other about our situations but we seldom ever got to the meat of our problems. Part of me kept it that way consciously. \n\nOut of the car and at the front door I knelt down and turned over the welcome mat, exposing and picking up a key that had been hidden underneath of it. I unlocked the front door and opened it casually, trying to mask the apprehension I had entering my own home. As soon as I was inside, my eyes and ears began to soak everything in. Trying to locate my mother so as to do my best to avoid her. I noticed that the TV was on in the living room, beneath the laughing tracks and the actors exaggerated expressions I could hear the shower running. \n\nThis was perfect. My mother was showering, I could be in and out before she even noticed I was home. \n\nI began to slowly slink to my room which was across from the bathroom. As I tiptoed my feet pressed deep into the shag carpet, I was diligent to make no noise. However, just before I reached for the knob on my bedroom door I stopped, noticing something awry. The door to the restroom was opened slightly. My mother was particular about everything. My mother especially particular about her privacy, regardless of if she were home alone or not. I braced myself mentally before checking in on her, gently knocking on the door. \n\n“Hey mom, you alright in there? You left the door open.”\n\nIn response her vocal chords scratched together a groan.\n\nI pushed the door opened with my finger, half afraid of what I’d find and half afraid of how she’d react. After I put two and two together I issued out a sigh, half relieved and half disappointed. \n\nShe was laid on the floor of the shower, humbled, naked and next to a small pile of vomit. Scolding water showered down on her as steam lifted up and clung to the mirror. Trying to maintain her dignity in my mind, I averted my eyes. \n\nIn the kind of tone people typically use when talking to drunkards, I said to her, “Alright, let’s get you up.”\n\nWith my back to her, I fetched a large towel from the cabinet then unfolded it and turned to face her again. Shielding her from shame and hoping she’d see it as an invitation to get up on her own, I opened the towel wide and stepped closer.\n\nShe all but mumbled, “It’s so warm.”\n\n“Mom, I know it’s warm. Your bed is warmer, I promise.”\n\nAs struggled to stand, she stumbled some and I steadied her so as to prevent her from slipping into her own mess. I covered her pale nakedness with the towel and walked her out of the bathroom.\n\nSlurring her words until they were almost English, she asked me, “Who’s your buddy?”\n\nI responded, “Ray. You know Ray.”\n\nShe seemed confused by my answer, saying, “Oh, I didn’t recognize him.”\n\nAs much as I loved her and wanted to restore some sense of (self) respect about her in my mind, her stupor agitated me. She made no sense and I had no patience to try and understand her. I hurried her to her bedroom and covered her body-wrapped-in-towel with her favorite blanket. I didn’t bother fighting her to get dressed, instead I made certain the curtains were closed and the doors were locked when I left. \n\nI cleaned up her vomit for her.\n\nOn my way out I went to my room and grabbed what Ray and I had driven over for in the first place. I made my way for the door then locked it behind me. \n\nAs I began the acre trek to the old red barn out back, I looked over my shoulder to check on Ray. His head was down, he was flipping through the CD wallet he kept in his car. Likely taking advantage of my absence and listening to music he loved that I couldn’t stand to be around. \n\nI entered into the barn and started for the few boxes I knew contained some my father’s old things. There were only two totes, my father took everything that may’ve been a reminder of his existence when he left my mother. It seems the only things he left behind pertained to activities we could’ve done together (i.e. fishing poles and other assorted gear for the outdoors). On the way to the far far corner of the rusting building where dreams of camping and constructing treehouses with dad go to die, I cursed my mother’s negligence. \n\nSome of the totes containing Derrick’s things were left opened and had been rifled through. My mother can get sappy and nostalgic when she drinks, it’s not uncommon for her to look over photo albums and unearth decade old baby clothes. Maudlin and obnoxiously sentimental, she could go on about when her and my father were happier. When Derrick took his first steps, when my father would sing for her or fix this and that around the house, etc.. \nIn her stupor she must’ve come out to the barn and grieved her ‘little boy’ who wasn’t so little anymore. I shut the opened totes and slid them off to the side. Preserving Derrick’s history wasn’t only important to my mother but to me as well. \n\nI then dug up the tote containing my fathers camping stuff and fetched a few things from inside. Nothing particularly crazy, all I took was a compass, a small spool of paracord, a large hunting knife, and a canteen. I didn’t anticipate that we would be at Green Oak for very long or that the trip would be anything worth remembering. However, as I would soon come to find out, I couldn’t have been more wrong."},"206":{"title":"Forked Tongue Stories","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqevo7\/forked_tongue_stories\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"ForkedTongueStories","selftext":"New YouTube channel called Forked Tongue Stories.

Flashy and European, it makes it incredibly easy to follow around town. That’s what I’ve been doing for the last week, every chance I get. I also figure the less I am holed up at home, the less likely I can get served by the legal team from the studio. I am banking on sniffing out Hunter’s secret before the legal team can find me, but the rich boy hasn’t been making my life easy. A week of trailing him back and forth has turned up nothing. Other than his big mansion on the outskirts of town, he only goes to work. Well presumably he goes to work, as I stop trailing him about a mile out from the studio because of the restraining order and I really don’t want someone from the studio spotting me and trailing me long enough to get court documents thrown at me. The start of the second week is when I got my first big clue. I waited down the road that he normally commutes to and from work, but he never showed up after his shift ended. About an hour in, I took a chance and drove past the studio, craning my neck to try to investigate the lot. Hunter's loud and flashy car was not there, and I sped off towards his mansion. Where could he have gone? Now that I was no longer there, he had been rotated back to the day shift. Everything I knew about the insufferable prick told me he wasn’t out clubbing at the end of his shift. \n\nI got to the street his mansion was on and parked down the road out of sight. He drove up about an hour later, and while he waited for the garage door to open, I peered intently at the body of the car. It was dusty, as if it had been down a dusty gravel road. Could he have gone and killed someone within a couple hours? The location must be within the city limits, despite the dust on his car, to be able to be there and back within such a short time. \n\nThinking of the roads that lead away from the studio, where he could turn down within a mile of exiting the lot, I realized the only destination that made sense was the university. I shook my head in disgust, thinking of all the sweet sorority girls that must have perished under this sicko’s hands. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. He must have gotten comfortable hunting university students while he was a student himself. If it has been successful for him before this, why change? The university was isolated, choosing to be away from the city center so it could have the space for buildings, dormitories, and sports fields it wanted to build. No doubt there were secluded forest patches and gravel roads at the perimeter of the property, where he could bring an unsuspecting victim to kill and stash away. \n\nI sat in the car, thinking, and chewing my mustache hair. I knew the best route to take to get to the university from the studio, and I could set up camp there instead. I would be gambling on who his prey was, but I think I was right.\n\nWhen Hunter left in the morning for work, I followed him towards the studio, before veering off around the mile mark. Then I drove the route towards the university and parked in a spot, hidden, but with a fantastic viewpoint. I hunkered down and waited. The hours crawled by, and I relieved myself in the bushes multiple times. Then, conscious of my unwashed hands, I snacked on protein bar after protein bar while sitting in the shade. Hunter’s shift ended and I was rewarded with the sight of his car coming my way. I let him pass and pulled out inconspicuously after him. We drove and drove, winding our way towards the university, and I felt a sense of smugness at figuring him out. Eventually, he turned right off a side street onto a gravel road, with a “No Exit” sign, and I continued driving past. There was no way I was going to be able to follow him without absolutely giving myself away. I parked off to the side, and waited for him to re-appear. Whatever Hunter did, it only took him less than an hour until he was coming back down the road, and I followed him to his house. Once I saw him back into his garage, I turned back to check out the mysterious gravel road. \n\nThe sun had already set by the time I got back, and I crawled my car down the lane keeping an eye on either side of the road. I figured I could spot a shallow grave if I was vigilant. The entire right side was essentially flush with a tall industrial fence with some serious barbed wire at the top, so I only had a few feet to inspect. By the time I ran out of road, I spotted nothing out of the ordinary, but I could only do so much in the dark. At the end of the street, the large industrial fence turned into a large industrial gate, with a key card access. There was nowhere else that Hunter could have gone, except through that fence. I put the car in park, got out and walked up to where the keycard was. Below the keycard was a sign that said “No trespassers, something something law”.  Above it, on a little bronze placard welded to the gate, read “DuPont Compound.”  Which was Hunter’s family’s name. I nearly sat down in the middle of the road. Oh, to be a filthy rich serial killer, having your own private butchering ground. I know the DuPont family has various properties all over the city, what was another small parcel of land next to the university? In fact, I believe there was a building named after the family somewhere on campus, with how much this family had donated over their many generations of wealth. I wonder how much money it took for the university to stay uninterested in the wooded property almost directly on top of the medical wing of the university.   \nI got back into my car and planned my next moves. There was no way I could follow him in with my car, but the wild undergrowth next to the room might give me the opportunity I need. \n\n ---\n\nThe following day I arrived at the road maybe 40 minutes before Hunter was set to arrive, if I got lucky and he came by again. I wore musty camo that I bought second hand at the thrift store, and squatted in a section of denser foliage that I hoped didn’t contain poison ivy. My car was parked further down the main road, past the point where Hunter would turn off to get home after his visit. Knowing I was going to need proof, I brought my second-best video recorder that had a decent zoom function. My best recorder was probably in a box somewhere in my ex’s garage, along with all the other goodies she cleaned out from me. That didn’t matter though, after tonight, everything would be made right. I sat in the bushes as the light faded and swiped away curious bugs and ripped leaves into little pieces. When finally, the sound of an approaching car started coming down the road, I held my breath as if he could possibly hear me through his closed windows. He parked, stepped out of his car, and swiped at the card reader with familiarity. He has been here many times, all his movements easy as only habit could make them. He got back in the car, and the gate opened in almost comical slowness. By the time the gate was open enough for his car to get through, he roared past and continued on without a look behind. I waited for another 30 seconds, and then darted out of the bushes and through the gate on foot. \n\nThe gate started closing, just as slowly, and I followed the route that Hunter must have gone if the dust of the road was any sign. After a few minutes of jogging, I spotted the bright red brake lights through the trees up ahead. I stepped into the bushes, and slowly approached. Hunter was still in his car, but was parked next to small cement lot with some sheets of metal piled near the center. I got as close as I dared, knelt down next to a tree, and got my camcorder ready. It was late in the day, so it was much darker under the trees than out in the open. I felt confident of my concealment, and with only an hour of daylight left, I would just get harder to spot as the light waned. Hunter finally left the car, a camera around his neck and holding what looked like a sketch book. He walked over to the pile of metal and put down the sketch book. Then he oh so gently and carefully lifted the top sheet and put it on the ground close by. Underneath the sheet was the unmistakable shape of a female body, looking like it had been there for at least a week as rot had set in. I stifled a gasp and fumbled with my camcorder. The wind in the trees was the only reason he didn’t hear the happy start up sound when I turned it on. I thanked my luck for that, as well as the wind also blowing the smell of decay the other way. Hunter took his camera, and started taking photos, almost clinically. I recognized the lens as one of the best macro lenses on the market, and he was using it to get close shots of an especially rotted section on the woman’s neck. I zoomed on the video recorder, capturing both his every move as he maneuvered around the body,  and then his sketching after he finally put the camera down. This is where he spent most of the hour, both of us in silence, him sketching and me filming. I kept waiting for him to start doing more nefarious, horror villain type things to the body, like I was used to doing with all the props that ended up on my worktable. Yet all he did was sketch until the light started fading enough that it must have been hard to see the details he wanted. He finally packed up and replaced the metal sheet back over the body with the same exaggerated care. When he got back into his car and started fiddling with his sketchbook or something. I turned and crashed through the woods as quietly as I could. I did not want to miss my exit when Hunter finally opened the gate to leave.  I got next to the gate and crouched in some bushes completely in shadow. When Hunter came back, he again used a card to open the gate and got back in his car to wait for it to slowly open.  \nThen he turned his head and looked right at me.   \nI couldn’t tell if his eyes made contact with mine, it was too dimly lit in that dark leathered interior. But all the hair stood up on my arms, and my heart sputtered into double time. He was so still, as the gate plodded open, looking directly into the undergrowth to where I was. My hand rested on my flip phone in my pocket, wondering if the police could get into the compound in time to save me from this killer. Then the gate was wide enough for his car to pass through, and he looked back towards the road before roaring away. Didn’t even wait for the gate to close behind him, just tore off down the gravel road and quickly out of view. I realized I had stopped breathing when he first looked at me and sucked in a deep breath full of little twilight flies. Then I moved out of the shade and past the gate that was still closing, inch by inch. Did he see me? Maybe he was just zoning out, looking at a random spot in the trees.  Maybe he was thinking about work, and the props he had to be making. He’d be the one who would have to do the final scene now, with the body chewed through by rats. Was he thinking how his dead woman could help him create that image? Yeah, that must be it. Zoning out and unluckily in my direction. I still felt uneasy though, because if he did see me, I might be next on his list. Whatever I did I’d have to do it now to save my hide.  I scurried back to my car on high alert, ears open for any snapped twigs in the woods or approaching cars. When I finally did get to my car, and locked the doors, I felt like I could melt into the driver seat in relief. His mistake, I thought, was to let me go.   \nI put the car in drive, and started heading down the road towards Hunter’s mansion, while pulling out my phone.  \n“I need the Police. I would like to report a murder.”\n\n -----\n\nTwice now I had given my statement, first to an officer while we were on Hunter’s front lawn, then to a detective at the police detachment while I sat on an uncomfortable chair in front of his desk. I was told not to leave even though hours ago they had taken the tape of Hunter examining the body.  Twice I had relived this story over the phone, first to Stuart, and then to Howard, who had both listened in shock. Bragged how I had caught a serial killer by using my decade long experience working with props to know that his props originated from something vile. Stuart was going to call the studio executives, while Howard offered to come down and wait with me at the police detachment. I thanked him but declined. If I was honest with myself, I wanted to enjoy this feeling that I had at great risk to my reputation. I got to be the hero. Like all the movies I worked on, all the gore and death, to be the hero winning against the villain that my entire profession revolves around. Proof that Hunter had to be the most pathetic and weak coward possible, to get to where he was without putting in the time and work, and coming by his talent honestly. I sat on the detective’s uncomfortable chair, but I hardly felt it. When the detective finally came back and sat down heavily, I was still drinking lukewarm coffee out of a Styrofoam cup that tasted like victory. \n\n“So, this is a bit of an unusual situation,” the detective began, rubbing his face tiredly.\n\n“Normally any trespassers at DuPont compound are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, without exception. This time however, they are willing to not press charges”\n\nThis was not how I was expecting this conversation to go. After seeing Hunter taken away in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser, and following to give my damning testimony, I expected a clap of the back and news that Hunter is behind bars. \n\n“I caught you a killer.” I said, in a clipped tone. “Surely that trumps any laws about trespassing if I was going to prevent murder on DuPont’s property.”\n\n“DuPont Compound,” the detective said, correcting me. \n\nI breathed hard through my nose, annoyed.\n\n“Yes, compound. What difference does it make? As long as Hunter is behind bars, what does it matter?” \n\nThe detective shook his head lightly. “Hunter has been released, about an hour ago.”\n\n“You let that murderer walk?” Why?” I said, suddenly feeling the lumps of the springs under my rear as I leaned back hard in disbelief.\n\n“Because,” the detective continued, “the body was at the DuPont Compound.”\n\nI must have looked blankly at the detective, my mouth in the shape of an O while the muscles next to it twitched with all the words I wanted to say.\n\n“The DuPont Compound is a Body Farm,” the Detective continued, “run by the University’s Forensic department out of the Medical Wing next to it. It’s called the DuPont Compound because the family has donated millions to the Medical Department. Sounds like one of the perks of having rich parents is that you get to access the body farm after hours to do your own study. It’s not something they want advertised as happening, as it was a favour by the university.”\n\n“Body farm.” I said stupidly. That was loads better than fifty bucks’ worth of a quick tour around a hospital morgue. \n\n“We had to verify that what you were calling the DuPont Property was actually the compound, and then we contacted the university to confirm the body you recorded Hunter examining was one that was in fact donated legally to the university.”\n\nI was right, but I was also wrong. Hunter was learning how to emulate dead bodies by working with dead bodies, but legally. \n\n“But once I explained the situation, they have decided to not press charges. You’re free to go.” The detective said, falling into a routine speech.\n\n“I’m free to go,” I repeated, stupidly. \n\n -----\n\nI finally went back to my apartment, almost in a daze. I no longer cared about the studio’s legal team finding me, because more than anything, I needed to drink. As I finished the first glass, my eyes watered at the taste. While I fully expected to drink the last half of the bottle tonight, the bitterness of the situation made it taste worse than normal. Each sip I took, I tried to come up with a plan, but I couldn’t think of a way out. Hunter would show up tomorrow to work, clearly not behind bars, and tell them the story of how the washed-out prop master stalked him for weeks. He would probably get praised at being so dedicated to the craft to actually study dead bodies, now that the cat was out of the bag. He would continue on working the final scene with the rats that used to be mine, and probably would win a damn Oscar for it. I was going to be the laughingstock of the industry, the paranoid prop master who can’t recognize real art even while he is elbow deep in it. Over and over, these thoughts circled around my brain, like a turd being flushed. I stopped thinking about the 6th glass in, and as I went to down the rest of the bottle, the world went dark. \n\n ----\n\nThe first thing that I became conscious of, was the sound of someone plucking metal strings of a weird sounding instrument. Who ever was playing was terrible, plucking the wires erratically and with no resemblance of a melody. The second thing that I became conscious of, although it was almost at the same time as the sound, was my head feeling like it was being pulled apart. Every slight move of my head radiated pain from the sockets of my eyes to the dent where my spine met my skull, and then down the tendons of my neck. Before I was even fully aware of what was going on, I knew I had to keep as still as possible. This was not a hangover I ever experienced before, and I’ve drunk liquor that was as close to gasoline as you could get. As awareness filtered back in, I kept my eyes shut, not wanting to risk more pain. With my eyes shut, I realized I was sitting, and my wrists and ankles were throbbing in the agony of something tight around them. I realized, then, that I couldn’t feel my hands or my feet. Panic started filming into my foggy brain, and I yanked at whatever secured my wrists to what I was pretty sure was the arm rests of the chair I was sitting in. The yanking did nothing except jostle my head and I let out a soft moan of pain involuntarily. \n\n“Oh good. I thought you were actually dying.” A voice said, belonging to the person playing that weird instrument. I cracked my eyes open, and my living room was a painful sight, halos appearing around the light’s sources. I was tied to my own desk chair, and the person was somewhere behind me. I didn’t have it in me to turn my head yet, the light hitting my eyes and head so badly I wanted to vomit. Actually, I think I might have already vomited, as I realized there was an acidic smell rising from my lap. I turned my eyes down, and I could see dark stains on my thighs. I had been puking up bile, at some point, not that I could remember. I swallowed softly, and realized the taste in my mouth could have been from something that died. \n\n“I figured you would take a swig or two of the whiskey, and then dump the rest of it. Surely you would be able to taste the drugs I put in it.” The voice continued, conversationally. Apparently not, I thought. Maybe I should have upgraded to a better quality of drink like Howard and Stuart. \n\n“Luckily for me, you survived it. I don’t think the final product would have been as accurate otherwise. And actually, the bile stains might lend it a bit more realism.” The voice said, as the person finally walked from behind me into my line of vision. It was Hunter. I jerked back, violently, and my vision danced with white flares as my head felt like someone was carelessly hammering in a handful of nails. I threw up again, pitiful ruminants of my stomach leaking out onto my already damp pants. \n\n“Easy, easy,” Hunter said, not even looking at me as he fiddled with his phone.\n\nSomeone else was behind me, I realized. I could still hear someone playing the instrument. Shuffling softly and plucking wires with more vigor than before. \n\nWho? The security guard? Another family member of the DuPont? My brain raced but I couldn’t think of who an accomplice could be. Hunter had set the phone leaned up against a shelf, pointing the camera at me, and was now fiddling with a proper camera, off to the side. I could hear the camera zoom in, as it pointed at my torso. \n\n“HELP” I yelled, and then whimpered. My throat was raw, and yelling felt like it was pulling my skull apart further. \n\n“Oh, I don’t think that will do much,” Hunter said, still fiddling with the camcorder.\n\n“You know the lawyers finally caught you here? After you drank the entire bottle of that shit you call whiskey, they knocked on your door. I watched it all from that closet over there.” Hunter finally turned and pointed behind me, and smiled, knowing full well I couldn’t turn to look. \n\n“You created a massive scene on your driveway, as you ran out there and I believe threw the papers at their vehicle. You screamed and ranted, asked the good lord for his help, and sobbed before stumbling back inside. Your neighbours are pretty far away, but I’m sure they heard it. No one came to check though.” \n\nHunter finally stopped and sat down on a chair in front of me, giving me his full attention. \n\n“What are you going to do?” I asked, softly. Hunter wasn’t a killer, right? I had proved that in the body farm. Hunter smiled, his rich boy lopsided smile that I’m sure got him out of speeding tickets and drug charges. \n\n“I’m going to make art. And every artist needs a good reference to copy from. The body farm is okay, good for getting decomposition just right. But the bodies there are so…” Here Hunter stopped and drummed his fingers against his knee as he searched for the word. \n\n“Sterile.” Hunter said, smiling again. \n\n“The bodies at the farm have all died fairly clean and whole. Perfect full-bodied corpses, that could be a sleeping victim rather than a corpse. And we both know that clean, soft deaths are not what the people want in their horror movies.” Here he winked at me, as if sharing an intimate secret with someone who would understand the madness he was spewing.\n\n“Soft deaths…” I repeated, not truly wanting to comprehend what he was saying.\n\n“Yes, soft deaths. Cancer, or heart attack, or Covid or who knows. Death without any trauma to the fleshy body. Boring. I can’t replicate the gore I need to for my films with just the bodies at the farm. And God knows I’d lose access if I fucked with any of them.” \n\nThe person behind me shuffled a little bit louder, and then I heard another noise. A squeak? \n\n“Like the prop I had to do with the face flayed open? I tried using just imagination. You saw what crap it was. The body farm just couldn’t give me the visual material I needed. I needed to go out and document my own. And what a masterpiece I made. It was glorious, as true to the real thing as I could make it.” Hunter’s eyes looked past me now, unfocused. Nausea swam up again from my stomach to the back of my throat. I had thought that prop was a real body, face peeled back, with all the tendons taught and still attached to the skull. It was a revolting mimicry of a real butchering. I had been right all along. Hunter was a killer.\n\n“You piece of shit.” I responded, the only thing I could say. \n\n“Me? You’re the one who destroyed it! I hadn’t taken good enough notes the first time either. Had to redo it and be more meticulous in capturing the methods. The aftermath. A good teaching moment from a veteran in the field, I suppose.” \n\nHunter sighed then and stood up. He went to the phone, and I heard the chime that signaled it was starting to record. \n\n“I had been preparing to use someone else for the final reference, but once I realized you were following me day after day, I figured I could solve two problems here.”\n\nHunter walked behind me, and I heard the sound of the metal being picked at again, and the sound of something plastic sliding off the table. The sound of shuffling, squeaking and metal plucking flared up in a frantic sound. \n\n“Honestly, I was also having trouble with that final scene. You couldn’t make it look right, and I don’t even want to try without first having a good reference to follow.”\n\nHunter walked back into my field of vision, holding a cage. Inside, still plucking at the metal wires with yellow teeth, were filled with writhing and frenzied rats. "},"208":{"title":"Have you ever seen a dead body? (1\/2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqavp3\/have_you_ever_seen_a_dead_body_12\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"vividvvitch","selftext":"“I can’t believe you made me hired him, Rob.” My Art Director, Stuart, says, clinking the ice in his whiskey glass absentmindedly.   \n“You’ve seen the bodies he makes,” I said, “I would be a fool not to bring all the talent I can onto this movie.” \n\nHoward, my product designer, scoffs next to me. No ice clinks in his glass. Apparently it is a crime to dilute the expensive whiskey he drinks. He always was adamant he was of a higher class than us both despite drinking at the same dive bar closest to the production lot every Friday after work. All three of us were working on a movie that we know will become a defining horror masterpiece. I was the Prop Master, leading the department in all physical effects like gore and corpses, making kills and torture look real on the big screen. Howard was the Production Designer, and the man in charge of how the scenes will look and the budgeting for the art department (including my prop team). Stuart, the Art Director, is basically the man who sees that Howard’s vision is met on set, doing the grunt work and bossing me around. We all started as gophers and interns though, back when there wasn’t a lick of CGI in any special effects.\n\n“We know he’s talented,” Howard added, “but you have also been bitching about him ever since he started making a name of himself within a year of graduating that pretentious film school out of Vancouver.”\n\n“Well yes” I ground out, falling into a familiar gripe that my two colleagues have no doubt heard multiple times within the last two and a half years. “And I have earned the right to bitch. It’s bullshit! You can’t just go to a school where they teach you how to mix corn syrup and red food dye and expect to be taken seriously in this industry.” \n\nI set my own glass on the counter and flagged the bartender for a fourth refill on my cheap and gasoline-tasting drink. Unlike the other two, I never bothered upgrading my choice of whiskey over our years of drinking together. \n\nThe Production Designer also signaled for another drink, then looked at me skeptically.\n\n“Oh yeah?” Howard sniffed, picking up his refreshed drink. “And how did you learn to make fake blood then? You take a book out of the library and then terrorize your nanny with murder scenes?” \n\n“Nanny! We didn’t have no nanny!” I replied, indignant. Howard knew I didn’t come from money, but he also knew how to press my buttons. We all knew how to press each other’s buttons. \n\n “I didn’t come from a privileged life like Hunter did, that little spoiled shit. He was sent to the best school money can buy, and then probably greased all sorts of palms to skip the years of working in indie shit films and art projects. No, I learned the way you should learn, how you’re supposed to make a name for yourself in this industry. Worked shit movies, volunteered for art projects so cringy your momma would weep. Then I apprenticed with some big-name asshole, working as his bitch, running around doing grunt work and not even touching final prop work for years. I paid my dues!”\n\nMy friends sitting at the counter, these two men I have worked with for close to a decade in various horror films, nodded solemnly. Our generation worked for the titles we now have, and we have all done our time in the trenches. \n\n“But you still want him on your team? Even if he’s a socially inept spoiled rich kid, the golden child of the DuPont family?” My Production Designer asked, putting an exaggerated French accent when saying DuPont. On Monday I had demanded he hunt down the DuPont kid and offer him a position, much higher than the typical grunt worker intern position most new special effect workers get. \n\nI swirled my drink a bit, knowing how much of a hypocrite I sounded like. \n\nMy Production Designer finished his third drink and spoke up when I was slow to respond. \n\n“We all saw his work in Ghoul-le-Mont. First actual job working in props for a horror movie that went viral, and actually snagged himself an Oscar nominee.  The kid is good.” \n\n“He didn’t snag himself a nominee,” The Art Director argued, while waving off the bartender’s offer for a refill. “It was the whole damn team on Ghoul-le-Mont that got that nominee. That nominee wasn’t for Hunter DuPont specifically.” \n\n“Oh, he says it was for him. The nomination was purely due to his work. Didn’t you see that interview he did on Youtoob? Spent 30 minutes talking about his art, as only a pretentious rich kid could. And yet none of the other visual effects team denied his claims.” I said, and then dove into a rant that I’ve already griped about many times before.  \n\n“But the other team members shouldn’t have to speak up for themselves! Your special effects team is family, and you hold each other up! I bet that little shit has never had to be accountable to a team in his entire life. You don’t go on some YouToober interview or whatever, and claim you were the only one with talent and the nominee should have been for you only. The entitlement!”  \n\nI waved the bartender to get a fifth refill. Tonight was proving to need more than my normal number of drinks to deaden the rage I felt at the kid. The kid that I personally pushed to have on my team, working on my set, on my career defining movie. \n\n“So then why did you make me hire him!” The Production Designer asked, once again, nearly as animated as me in my last outburst. \n\n“Because of his bodies.” I said, and my two friends waited for me to elaborate, knowing I had more to say.\n\n“Look,” I said, “have either of you two seen a dead body?” \n\nThey looked at each other, uncomfortable. \n\nHoward shook his head, but Stuart nodded slowly. \n\n“Yea, I was there when my pop’s passed, in hospice. The nurses let us stay with him for an hour or so because I barely made it in time.”\n\n“So, you’ve seen death,” I said, “but it was clean. Sanitized. I have seen a real body once. I had to slip a fifty dollar bill to the security guard at the hospital morgue, and barely got to see a car crash victim folded in half on a gurney.”\n\n“Jesus!” Howard burst out, putting down his glass hard onto the table. “It’s one thing to make horror props of death and gore, it’s another thing to gawk at what was an actual, living person, Rob.”\n\nI waved him away.\n\n“I only did it once and was caught. The security guard got canned immediately and I was put on a blacklist for the hospital. Not like it mattered though. I had been tasked at making a prop of a drowning victim, and the crash body gave me absolutely zero reference for that. Considering how much money I’d need to get that kind of access to bodies for reference, full time? How many palms I’d need to grease for the authorities to look the other way and not ask questions? Christ, I couldn’t afford it even before Sally took all my money in the split”\n\nI took another long sip of my drink, enjoying the discomfort of my drinking partners at hearing my story, but continued before they could start going on about morals.\n\n“Anyways, the thing with the horror props is that we make them to the best of our imagination. We imagine gore and dead bodies, and we usually make things exaggerated for an audience to scream and squirm at. Yet anyone with two brain cells can look at horror props and instinctively tell it’s fake. Why? Because your imagination is different to my imagination, and our brains can know when something looks made up. We suspend our disbelief because it’s fun to be scared. But we have never walked away wondering if we just watched a movie filled with actual cadavers. Until Ghoul-le-mont.”\n\n“Well, that Oscar nominee was completely deserved” Stuart said, frowning, “the corpses were absolutely masterfully done.”\n\n“So, you want realistic corpses for Scarifier? That’s it?” Howard asked me, as if that’s all it was.\n\n“Well yes” I said, “This new blockbuster movie is going to need an army of corpses, and considering how much the studio is dumping money into it, I want corpses that are quality. Even if it means hiring an upstart little educated prick.” \n\nMy Production Designer eyed me skeptically. After years of working together, he could sniff out when I wasn’t fully being honest. It’s an annoying gift, as he’d often know as soon as I went over budget on props for a scene I was crafting. Luckily, though, his desire for the success of the movie was his constant and biggest motivator, so he just waved the bartender to ask to pay for his tab. \n\n“I’m still pretty shocked about it, though,” Howard said, also pulling his wallet out to pay. “You have been actually frothing at the mouth about this kid for the better half of a year.” \n\nStuart nodded along, as I threw down my own card to pay for my share. \n\n“Seriously, Rob, we know how much you have told us you hate this kid. But you asked and I went out of my way to get him on this set. Oscar nominee or not, I wouldn’t have hired a kid right out of theatre club if I didn’t trust you. So, you better be right. He can’t fuck up this movie. Biggest movie of our careers and I swear to God if this kid ruins it, it could be the end of our careers.”\n\n“Yes, yes” I said dismissively, getting to my feet. “He starts in my department on Monday, so I’ll make sure he’s not off playing Pokémon in the back lots. Don’t worry.”\n\nWe left the pub and we each headed home, the same as last Friday and the Friday before that. Howard and Stuart to their irate wives who have been waiting on them to start dinner, and me to my divorcee bachelor den where I can have another glass of cheap whiskey and curse my hag of an ex-wife for taking all my money. \n\nI was looking forward to Monday, though, and working with that little DuPont shit up close. I had a theory about all of Hunter’s dead bodies. Why his team had kept so quiet when Hunter bragged about his superiority. Why, without too much experience, he created bodies that looked so real, our subconscious brains rebelled looking at them even on a big screen. The only way that could happen, is if real cadavers were being used. Maybe I’ve worked in Hollywood too long and have worked on more slasher films than most of my peers, but I know this guy is the real deal. I know the limitations of the props that can be created due to our imagination. And I’m going to expose him as a killer and ruin his rich prick god damned life.   \n  \n----\n\nI got Hunter working on dismembered limbs. We needed thirty for this one shot, and it was the perfect project for him to prove his worth in my team. Of course, it wasn’t just dismembered limbs, but they had to look stretched out. The shot was the hero’s sidekick #3 dying on a legitimate torture rack, while surrounded by the aftermath of his entire football team’s ripped and stretched out bodies. God, I love horror movies. \n\nI left him to his own devices, while the rest of my team worked on the torsos and the heads of the rest of the football roster. I was working on the face of the one character who had the misfortune of being a jerk to the hero, and I was fully in my element. At the end of the day, all my team had checked in with me from time to time, getting some direction or encouragement. Not Hunter though. He barely even acknowledged anyone else, and didn’t even take lunch with us. When I did the rounds at the end of the day, checking on quality of work and assigning work for the following shift, I was eager to get to the product of Hunter’s efforts of the day. \n\nWhen I finally got to his workstation, my stomach did a little queasy flip. It was a real fucking arm. Is that where he went, when we all left for lunch? To hack off someone’s arm and display it like a butcher in my shop? Fucking sicko.\n\nWithout thinking, I reached down and grabbed it by the forearm, causing the normally quiet Hunter to bark at me.\n\n“HEY, don’t touch it!” \n\nI ignored him, focused on the stretched floppy arm in my hands, real and clammy as any corpse you’d find in a morgue.\n\n“Did you hear me, you old fucking boomer? I said don’t touch my ART!” Hunter said again and lunged at the arm in my hands. I lost my grip, shocked that this kid would dare challenge someone in such a position of authority as I, and the arm landed with a fleshy thunk on the table. Hard enough, that the wrist split, nearly severing the hand from the rest of the arm. The carnage then clearly showed the polyfoam rubber layers it was made out of. \n\nIt wasn’t a real arm. Of course it wasn’t. How could he have snuck in a fake arm to sit on the shelf for days until we were ready for the shot? \n\n“Bruh, you fucking wrecked it.” Hunter said, looking at the ruined product of his day’s work. Even where my grip had been around the forearm had changed the appearance from real arm to obvious prop. My shock turned to anger as my brain finally fully registered the disrespect. I looked down my nose at Hunter, even as he refused to meet eye contact with me. \n\n“I don’t care if your dear old pappy smoothed the bruised egos of all the people you talked to like that before, but in my shop, kid, you’re not going to get away with such lip to me.” \n\n“You fucking wrecked it.” Hunter said again, quieter, almost impotently.\n\n“Did you hear me?” I said, leaning over the table, breathing into his baby cheeked face. \n\nI felt a hand on my shoulder tugging me back, and the Production Designer’s voice saying “woah” in a calming tone. I have no idea why Howard was in my workshop but the look he sent me reiterated, without saying a word, our Friday talk about not ruining his movie. \n\nI let Howard pull me back and told Hunter to fix it for tomorrow as I turned and walked away without giving him another glance.\n\n -----\n\nHunter produced all 30 limbs in about two weeks, and I’m embarrassed to say the rest of the team’s work looked like apprentice work next to his dead replicas. Like having doll torsos in a pit of real limbs. The difference was so staggering that some of my team went to him asking for tips and advice instead of me. I fully expected his normal belittling dismissal he gave to the common folk trying to have normal conversations with him. Instead, he was helpful and guided a few of the newer team members into creating some work that rivaled the veterans. It pissed me off. I ruined three more limbs, “checking” his work after the team had left for the day. I needed to check, but I also didn’t want to get into another altercation with Hunter that would get back to the Production Designer. There was no way to avoid it, the limbs were getting better and better, and my gut reaction was that these could not possibly all be props. Each time Hunter arrived at work the next day to find his arm or leg manhandled, he’d go and tattle to Howard. After the third prop was “ruined”, all his going over my head got him the result Hunter must have wanted. \n\n“I’m taking him off your team and giving him his own.” Howard told me during another round of Friday drinks. I choked on my sip of whiskey, making the burn worse than before and making my eyes water.\n\n“What!?” I argued, appalled, “He doesn’t have the experience to lead a team! He’s got to work his way up to that!” I looked towards Stuart, to get some backup for my argument, but he only shook his head.\n\n“Rob, I’ve been seeing his props coming out of workshop. At least the ones you didn’t touch. That’s raw talent in that kid. You know how much props I need to fill my scenes? Not only can that kid produce, but damn he’s got skills. That one beefy footballer’s thigh he made yesterday? Absolute art.”\n\nHoward continued after Stuart, “I am going to use the talent of the prop department appropriately and use him for more than to pad a scene. If I can have two teams making the money prop pieces for the important shots, I’d be a fool not to.”\n\n“I can just give him bigger projects,” I said, annoyed. \n\n“Rob, you have been butting heads with him since day one,” Stuart said. \n\n“Plus,” Howard said, before I could respond, “you have destroyed four props he has made, without any decent reason as far as I can tell.”\n\n“He’s still an inexperienced kid barely out of diapers!” I said, defensively. I knew very well that my excuses for destroying the props were incredibly weak. But I was fully banking on my title as Prop Master to keep me out of the fire. \n\n“He’s producing props with speed and skill of someone with years more experience than him, and you know it.” Howard countered, again narrowing his eyes. He was suspicious of my answer, but he didn’t push for more reasoning, instead focused on how he could produce better for the movie. \n\n“He’s getting his own team” he reiterated, “and I’m putting him on the night crew with some of the interns who’d kill to have an actual spot on the team rather than just running for coffee and materials. I’ll give him the B workshop, since the budget of this movie can afford to have both running. That way I can also ensure that each shift will have their stuff locked in the workshop when unattended.” \n\n“You can’t be serious!” I said, my surprise making my tone condescending, “You think I’d be willing to sabotage this movie because I can’t stand a spoiled rich kid? You know me better than that.” \n\nI would, however, do what was needed to prove the kid was a murder and not just a spoiled pampered kid who didn’t pay his dues. \n\nI didn’t say that to Stuart or Howard. As much as I trusted these guys, I was starting to wonder if they’d keep a murderer on payroll if he could produce the physical effects they needed for their career-defining movie. \n\n“I don’t care why you did it. Maybe he has pissed in your coffee every morning. Maybe living as a bachelor for the first time in 45 years is hell and the bottle is getting to you. God knows you’ve been through the wringer of late. Especially after Sally took you for all you’re worth in likely the fifth brutal divorce I’ve seen here in Hollywood. I don’t know what’s going on with you, but I told you I can’t have this movie failing. The kid is good enough that I want to use him, and I’m going to make sure I am not losing money and props needlessly. So, this is how it is.”\n\n“This is how it is, huh?” I asked, drowning my whiskey in a single swallow, and signaling for the bill. \n\n“Yes Rob,” Howard said, calmly. “Starting Monday, Hunter is off your team and starting on the scene in the clinic.” \n\nI didn’t respond, just nodded once and threw some cash down to take care of my portion as I turned to leave the pub. The fools. I would have bet my shitty apartment that I was the only reason Hunter wasn’t using real cadavers at the moment. Not when I was watching him closely and “checking” his props so thoroughly. Howard just gave him free reign to go back to his sick, butchering ways. The entire drive home, I barely saw the road. The anger at the loss of the leash on Hunter taking up nearly all my thoughts. Once I get back to my apartment, I’ll put out a bottle of even shittier whiskey that I always keep on hand and have the drinks I should have had with my two traitorous friends tonight. Drink and try to come up with another way to expose his sick work by any means possible. \n\n ----\n\nThe clinic scene was a gruesome one, and while I was annoyed that it was going to Hunter and his team, I had my own scene to work on. I was working on the final shot, the redemption scene. The scene where the killer is trapped in a hole by the hero, and left alive to be eaten through by rats, trying to escape the trap that the killer himself had set. Where do writers come up with these ideas? I was struggling, trying to figure out the progression of the rats chewing through flesh and muscle. Hunter didn’t have something as technical, his scene in the clinic is a sidekick getting his face flayed by a scalpel while sitting on a medical chair. It was still an important shot, though. This was the scene they wanted to film almost immediately and use in promotional work. We had a pretty famous cameo in the scene as well, and I didn’t think how much money the studio had dropped to get them, considering they were supposedly currently filming another superhero film. Timelines were critical, the kid has to produce in a tight turnaround, and I couldn’t even monitor the kid’s work. With the kid’s new night shift being opposite to mine, I was left in the dark as far as that scene was progressing.  \n  \nThe week went by, as I casually tried to find reasons to get into the locked set room. With a stroke of luck, I finally got in on my Friday shift about an hour before I was to meet the boys for drinks. I made a detour to walk by the set room and tried the handle. Miraculously, security had forgotten to lock it. I immediately went in, shutting the door with a soft click behind me. I made my way to where Hunter’s work bench was, and the chair and prop of the victim were posed. The scene was scheduled to be filmed on Wednesday, so the work needed to be essentially complete. The prop was there, and my breath caught.   \nIt looked fake. The gore over exaggerated, the blood overdone. It looked like the work of someone who didn’t have the years of experience to pull off what this scene was asking of him. This was bad, but entirely different than the way I thought it was going to be bad. I was expecting a real corpse, and instead I got work that did not belong on this caliber of a movie. I left the late shift’s work room and went back to my own work bench. I would have to tell Howard, take the chewing out for breaking into that room. At least I could tell him tonight at the pub, after he has at least two drinks first. \n\n -----\n\nOn Monday, Stuart stopped by my worktable and told me he wanted me to accompany him. The security guard with him looked bored, probably pulled away from his patrol around the set. Stuart was never one to keep keys with him though, not if he could have someone else take the responsibility for it. \n\n“So, you agree that giving Hunter his own team was a bad idea?” I asked, as we made our way to the workshop on the other side of the production studio. \n\nStuart looked at me, still unimpressed that I had entered the room when Howard had clearly asked me not to. \n\n“I still find it surprising that Hunter’s quality of work dropped so immensely now that he’s not got you looking over his shoulder. Like Stuart was saying on Friday, we’ve been getting check ins from him and he’s not said anything about his team or him struggling with the scene.” \n\nOf course he wouldn’t,” I argued, “why would a spoiled rich kid who has gotten to where he is by money and more money, admit his shortcomings? Probably not used to actually working hard, and only relying on his dad throwing money at people that he’s pissed off.” \n\nThe security guard cleared his throat, a little awkwardly. I had forgotten he was walking with us, despite the jingle his many keys made as he walked. \n\nStuart looked at him, considering. “The door will be locked, this morning, correct?” \n\n“Yes sir,” the security guard answered, “I locked it myself after Hunter left around 5 this morning.”\n\n“Hunter was here working in the middle of the night on a Sunday?” I asked, suddenly nervous. \n\nThe security guard nodded, as he reached the door and started unlocking it.\n\n“Yes, when I started the 4am shift, and took the keys from the night crew. I was told that the team lead was in the Clinic workshop room, and he was to tell us when he left. I think Dave said he came in around 7pm on Sunday and stayed through the night.”\n\nThe door opened and we made our way to the workshop bench, and the medical chair with the flayed open face. \n\nThe security guard saw the corpse, and involuntarily took a step back. Stuart also paused and whistled a clear strong note of approval. My stomach felt like it dropped out of my ass and landed on the floor. This was not the prop I had seen on Friday. This was not a prop at all. It couldn’t be. This has to be the recently deceased corpse of the victim Hunter caught on Saturday and pulled onto the workshop table for butchering on Sunday night. \n\n“I believe this work is very much adequate for this movie, Rob.” Stuart said, taking a quiet step closer.\n\nMy body refused to take any step closer to the flayed body, the revulsion physically stopping my feet from moving. \n\n“This…. this is not…… that’s a real body, Stu.” I said, the words coming out without thinking.\n\n“A real…. What? No, Rob. This is a prop. This is what serious studio money can buy us. This is what your insistence that we get this kid on our team, has gotten us. Grade A horror prop work.” Stuart said, even giving my shoulder a companionly clasp. \n\n“I can tell a real corpse when I see one, you fucking blind idiot” I said, lurching forward. My resoluteness overcame my revulsion, and I would make Stuart see that this was a poor person lying dead on company property. \n\nI didn’t even get close. I guess my other earlier antics, where I had destroyed props by checking them over, put Stuart on edge. He had never unclasped my shoulder and yanked me back. I admit we scuffled, and the security guard got involved, hauling my Prop Master ass out of the room and locking it behind us. \n\n“Stay the fuck out of that room Rob. I fucking mean it.” Stuart said, face patchy and red with the excursion of yanking me away. \n\n“And if this room is discovered unlocked again,” Stuart said, turning to the security guard, “I am firing the entire security company, for the entire fucking studio. Got it?”\n\n“Yes sir.” The security guard said, no trace of boredom lining his face anymore. \n\nI shrugged off Stuart’s hand that was still on my elbow and walked away. \n\n“Rob, look. We’re friends and you’re a pretty big name in the biz, but you can’t fuck this up. If something goes wrong with this scene and the filming this Wednesday, then shit will hit the fan and you’re going to take most of the hit. You understand that?” \n\nI didn’t bother responding, still breathing heavily myself from trying to shake him off earlier. I just stalked away, back to my own workshop, and to my own scene I was working on. I half heartedly sketched designs, my brain working overtime. \n\nThere was a dead body in this building at this very second. Stuart didn’t believe me, but he hasn’t been working with props his entire life. Doesn’t understand the limitations of the material we work with, or the limitation of our imagination. How does anyone know what a flayed body would look like, truly? While everyone else is looking at the props that Hunter makes, I can truly see the corpses Hunter actually makes. I know that the corpse on his worktable is real, and everyone else just thinks the guy is gifted. He’s a killer, a charlatan, a rich kid hiding his butchering with his parents’ money. This might be my only chance to expose this creep, before his career allows him to butcher more and more people. Sorry Stuart, but I have to get back into that room. \n\n ----\n\nThe plan was to avoid Stuart all of the next day, which turned out easier than I expected as I was chained to my own workbench. I was struggling hard with getting the corpse looking realistic, visualizing what tiny little rodent teeth could do to skin, muscle and bones. Howard eventually dropped by, to check on me after the altercation from the previous day. I assumed he was going to give me a second talking to, but then he saw what I was working on. \n\n“What is that supposed to be? This looks like something exploded out of a pumpkin, not rats digging into someone’s chest. Jesus Rob, maybe you need to take a couple days off to get your head back in the game?”\n\n“What? Oh, come on, it’s not that bad.” I argued, but honestly, he wasn’t all that far off.\n\n“It’s bad. We need this done by late next month, and the rest of the props around it. You can take a few days off and we can get Hunter to have a crack at it.” The Production Designer said, eyes losing focus as he looked at schedules within his mind’s eye. \n\n“No. Absolutely not.” I said, voice tight. “Honestly, Howard, I think I just need some time focused on just this prop, and not running around managing the team.” My mind raced ahead, and I saw how to make myself an opportunity.\n\n“I’m going to work late tonight, after my team leaves for the day. Bang out a few hours just on this one prop. You know what I can build with a few hours of focus.” I said, banking on Stuart shifting his priority onto having a well-done prop than worrying about babysitting me. \n\n“A few hours focus and a shot of that gasoline you call whiskey, yes.”  Howard said, before sighing.\n\n“We both need this movie to be successful, and it’s my reputation staked on this prop. I have to just hammer this out. I’m just going to hammer this out.” I said, knowing what buttons to press after knowing Howard for so long. As worried as he is about the conflict between me and the prop department’s new golden boy, he also knows how much this movie is going to matter in the horror genre. I saw him looking at me, contemplating, and I decided to hammer one last nail into my argument.  \n“You’re right, this water balloon with pumpkin guts is garbage. I’m not going to risk my reputation by focusing on anything other than this. I can’t let that kid show me up.”   \nHis shoulders relaxed, and I knew I had him.   \n“All right buddy, I’ll let security know you’ll be hanging around. Let them know when you leave, so they can lock up this area.” Howard said, confident in how the evening was going to play out. Confident in the knowledge that I was too proud of the name I created for myself in the film business to really fuck it up now.  \nHe was wrong though. My career was important yes, but the world needed me to be a hero more than a Prop Master.\n\nWhen my team left for the evening, I had about 45 minutes until the night shift came in. I tried walking past the other workshop, hoping against all hope that it would be unlocked, and I could get in at that dead body. There was a security guard stationed at the door, however, and we made some awkward eye contact as I purposely walked past him.\n\n“Just grabbing something from my car,” I muttered and walked down the hall to the exit while trying to avert my eyes, all while the security guard watched with a bored look on his face.\n\nI continued to my car, because, frankly, I didn’t know what else to do. I sat in the driver’s seat and thought of my options. I was in a frozen state of indecision and frustration, and when I saw the night shift pull into the lot and head into the building, I swore loudly into my steering wheel. I missed my shot to get in before the team. I opened the glove compartment and pulled out a bottle of emergency whiskey. I felt like I was in a state of emergency enough to allow myself a sip of the drink that Stuart called Gasoline. Three more mouthfuls in, and I had the loose idea of how I could get into that room. Stuart and Howard would be absolutely pissed at me, but I would be untouchable once I revealed Hunter for what he was, and the killings he was doing behind the scenes. I headed back into the building and past the second workshop door, now open and buzzing with energy from the night shift. The security guard was still there, and I avoided a second bout of awkward eye contact by shuffling past. \n\nBack at my worktable, I looked at the mannequin I had been working on which I had spent multiple hours on and quite a bit of the Art Department’s budget on. Then I dumped the rest of the whiskey on it and set it on fire. \n\nThis wasn’t the first time something caught on fire in the prop department, as often the best way to get something to look charred was to set it on fire. But this dummy went up in flames in a mesmerizing and utterly uncontrollable way. I hurried towards the door and locked it behind me as I left. Then I yanked on the fire alarm and ducked into a bathroom. I could hear the pandemonium outside in the hall, frantic hammering on the door and the jiggling of many keys while the security guard tried to get in. I slipped out as the security guard continued to fumble and rushed to the other workroom. It was wide open and deserted, and I made my way directly to the dead body lying on Hunter’s counter. It looked pristine, probably embalmed at home in the basement of Hunter’s mansion before being dragged out here. I reached out and revulsion made my mouth water as my body started gearing up to puke. I tenderly touched the body. It felt cool and clammy, the exposed flesh pulled back on its face sinewy with all the tendons and muscles displayed with absolute precision. I went to force the skin flaps of the face back, to give the corpse some decency, and they snapped off in my hands. I looked at the layer, and it looked…. like rubber? I prodded the face, and the thin fibers of muscles disintegrated in my hands. I reached for a bigger handful, pulling out stringy flesh that resembled the sound of grass being ripped from the ground. I rolled them between my fingers, and realized it was all meticulously crafted plastic.   \n“No.” I said, panic rising in my throat. Even if it wasn’t a full corpse, he had to be using body parts to create this abomination. I started ripping apart the prop, looking for evidence of real flesh and of Hunter’s dark secret so I could finally expose it. I found nothing. That’s how the security guard found me, and for the second time that week I was hauled out of that room against my will. I don’t remember the fire department coming by, or the security guard asking me to wait with the other employees huddling in the designated evacuation site. I made my way back to my vehicle and drove home. \n\n -----\n\nI ended up costing the studio a fair amount of money. If it had just been the minimal fire and water damage of the first workshop, I think I could have gotten away mostly unscathed. Things catch on fire commonly enough that there is a robust sprinkler system, and it prevented anything other than my prop from burning. Well, there were another couple props that were ruined, but most of the other in-work projects had been stored safely away from getting wet. The biggest loss, of course, was the flesh face prop Hunter has been putting the final touches on. Absolutely destroyed, and not by water. The security guard reported what he found, and how he had dragged me away while I had been elbow deep in Hunter’s “art piece” as he calls it. With the prop destroyed, the filming for the next day had to be canceled. The star they had hired to be in the cameo wasn’t able to reschedule due to their own commitments, and I think he walked away with full payment as well. Hours of schedules had to be revisited, timelines adjusted, and of course the studio was pissed. Shit hit the fan, and I got the brunt of the hit just like Howard warned. I got a call from the Studio’s legal team, saying I had been fired, and I wasn’t to come within a mile of the studio or any filming locations. I think Stuart still tried to protect me, though, as there didn’t seem to be any criminal charges being laid against me. I still fully expected the studio’s legal team to be gearing up to pursue legal action despite Stuart’s help. Which meant that now, more than ever, I needed to prove that Hunter was a killer. The night of the fire, I sat in my stagnant apartment and drank half of my favourite whiskey and had to admit to a few things. Hunter clearly is good at what he did, making corpses that he calls art pieces. I can’t pretend that he is anything but gifted at the use of plastics, rubber, and casting. What he makes is beyond anything I have seen in my career making props. The skill of his hands I can admit to, but not his imagination. The only way he can possibly be making corpses that look as real as the ones he makes, is by studying real corpses. No one’s imagination is that good, that anatomically correct, or that precise in how blood dries after your flesh has been peeled away while you are still alive. I need to prove that Hunter is still the monster I know he is, and if I can do that, I can absolve all my sins I committed at the studio. The world still needs a hero, even if I’m currently the only person who recognizes it. \n\n\n \n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/s\/fFh24Yh76i)\n\n"},"209":{"title":"Perry can only put on clothes and take off clothes through dancing ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fqd4qw\/perry_can_only_put_on_clothes_and_take_off\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"Perry can only put on clothes and take off clothes by dancing. Perry doesn't know why this is the way and the only reason I found out was when he stayed over at my house. He stayed over at my house because his flat was leaking really badly and the landlord was taking time to fix it. I have known perry all my working life and we have become good friends. Perry told me that there is only 1 way that he can take off his clothes and put on new clothes, and it is through dancing. \n\nWhen it was nearing for both us of to sleep, perry started dancing to music and slowly his clothes started to disappear. Then when I tried to take the remaining parts of his shirt, it was stuck to his body. Then perry danced till he was naked and then I was just weirded by it. Then perry started dancing to different music and then new clothes started appearing. It didn't make sense but clothes started appearing on his body. When I tried putting clothes on him, the clothing would be repelled. So perry danced and he danced the nakedness away and he had new clothes on his body now. \n\nI would be waken to music because perry would be dancing to make himself naked again. Then he would dance again to new music and new clothes would appear on his body. It was bizarre but it was perry's life. When perry had to to go to an expensive event hosted by his family. He brought dead animals into my home and then he started dancing on top of the dead animals. He became naked again, and then when he to dance on top of the animals, a really fancy tuxedo started forming around his body. Clothes even started forming around the dead animals. \n\nIt was disgusting and the types of animals he killed were not the pet types, but rather they were the types that carry diseases. Perry was really well suited and booted. I didn't know what to think and perry didn't seem to care about the possible diseased animals that he had killed to dance on top of them, he only cared about the fashion. Then he got invited to another event and it was a costume event. Perry had to dance on dead things again to give himself a great costume, the dead things he had had to dance on top of had to be human. \n\nHe was then staring at me. I don't want perry in my house anymore.

I can’t thank you enough, and you are the reason why I feel calm and haven’t gone insane.\n\nSo, after the previous posts, Burnt Luigi and I were talking to each other on Discord, again, like I said. How is this man speaking to me even if he’s banned by Discord for breaking their terms of use? No, really, does this freak have a bunch of alternate accounts or something? I am curious.\n\n…\n\nHere are our messages; for some reason, these seemed to be directed to my works. This time, I will just write down the messages word by word, and I will let you analyze them and not narrate them like I did on my third post.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Hello Joseph.\n\nMe: Hello, do you need anything?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Yes.\n\nMe: What exactly do you want?\n\nBurnt Luigi: I checked out your stories and that game of yours.\n\nMe: Ah, you mean Five Nights at Prototype Fredbear's, and if you saw my stories, which ones exactly?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Yes, I mean that game, and as for stories, you wrote Sammy the Cat, correct?\n\nMe: Correct, I wrote Sammy the Cat; what about it?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Sooo, you wrote the story featuring that fascinating show from 2019 and that human inside of a white homemade cat costume with black patches, googly eyes, and that smile going from cheek to cheek?\n\nMe: Very specific, but yes, that’s the story.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Cool :)\n\nMe: Thanks; honestly, you are acting... strangely nice to me.\n\nBurnt Luigi: No problem—I AM NINTENDO, I AM NINTENDO, I AM NINTENDO, I AM NINTENDO.\n\nMe: O\\_o, You good?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Yeah, don't disappoint Luigi.\n\nMe: ...okay?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Sorry, I got carried away—don't say okay to me like that, I will murder you.\n\nMe: Uhm…\n\nBurnt Luigi: Hey, did you write The Crumbling House Next to Me?\n\nMe: Yes, and do you mean Crumbling House Next Door?

It is bullying, and I am pretty sure death threats in general are against the law and can get you sent to jail.\n\nBefore I block and report you, I wish for you to screw off and leave me alone. I don’t give a crap if I am disappointing \"Luigi,” like you say, and I definitely don’t care whether you’re Nintendo or not.\n\nGoodbye &lt;3\n\nThat’s the last message I made before reporting and blocking him. Is this a reasonable reaction? Yes, was my reaction a bit dramatic? Probably, look, I can get very upset very easily, and the bullcrap said by this moron isn’t an exception. He literally hinted at hacking me and threw in a death threat just to get under my skin.\n\nLike I said in that message, if giving death threats isn’t against the law, then I don’t know what is, as the person is literally hinting at killing you. Now yes, I know Burnt Luigi didn’t specifically state that I should die and instead told me to get off and have a fainting spell, which is absolutely horrible as those don’t feel good at all, especially when I am feeling nauseous and vomiting on top of that. Not exactly a death threat, but that is just threatening me to have medical issues.\n\n…\n\nI miss being a kid again, as I have to deal with hard assignments in high school, and on top of that, I have to sit there and write these posts and share them with my therapist and all of you. My therapist doesn’t seem to believe most of the details, but I am thankful that you guys are making an attempt to help me. Sure, I may have been dramatic in these posts, but if you were in my shoes, you may not blame me.\n\nHonestly, just dealing with fainting spells and some illness is not making the situation better. I hope things get better when I enter adulthood, but honestly, that will even become a challenge; I have to sit there and pay bills, take my future children to school—not that I have a problem with having children, of course, but they may have horrible problems like I did, and all of that.\n\nNow, please keep in mind, just because of my experiences with this copy of Super Mario 64. I don’t hate the game or the series, heck, not even Luigi. I will continue to enjoy Mario, and just because of this haunting experience, I won’t let it end my love for this series.\n\nOkay.. I will stop rambling, but I had some horrible nightmares after those messages were sent. Please don’t laugh, and yes, I am saying that because of Five Nights at Prototype Fredbear’s being involved, just please hear me out. I understand that Five Nights at Freddy’s isn’t that scary anymore, considering the fanbase and stuff.\n\nBasically, one of these dreams involved Sammy the Cat and some of Crumbling House Next Door; they seemed vivid, hence why I remember them all very clearly.\n\nThis dream involved me inside of the Crumbling House Next Door (which genuinely freaks me out considering how when I wrote that story, I actually live next to that house, you can tell by the photo used in that story; it looks exactly like the one from that story), with a television on, and no, this won’t end up as one of those “lost media” posts or whatever since I brought a TV up. Let me explain what happened.\n\nIt showed the text, Sammy the Cat, rolling across the screen with the year 2019. Yes, this played out similarly to how I wrote that story, but when it showed Sammy staring for a solid minute, as it cut to the man eating in a bowl. I could swear I saw him, Burnt Luigi, behind the television in the dark, bending down and staring directly at me as it showed this scene. Sammy, the costumed man, twisted his head directly at me, tearing proportions, as he stopped eating from the bowl; his googly eyes fell out of his eyes. I saw Richard Turner’s face underneath the costume, in which I confirmed that was the actor in its sequel, Sammy’s Secret. He seemed to be completely burned in the same manner as Burnt Luigi.\n\nHe had the same teeth as he did, which looked strange considering how I never wrote the actor to be dead.\n\nI watched in horror as the mouth (which wouldn’t be possible as it is a part of Sammy’s costume design) opened completely wide as the maggots inhabiting the corpse fell into the bowl, wiggling.\n\nRichard in the costume then dropped onto the group as an eye socket fell out; there seemed to be even more maggots wiggling in there. I saw Burnt Luigi in the background of the DVD, holding the blindfolded woman from the main story; instead of Sammy shooting her, I watched as Burnt Luigi opened his jaw and started to place her into his mouth, then the episode ended with the teeth slamming down onto the neck, sounds of flesh being torn and bones breaking.\n\nAfter that dream, I had one related to Five Nights at Prototype Fredbear’s. I was inside of Fredbears, the setting of the first game, Joseph’s World Incorporated was in the second one.\n\nI checked the cameras; Prototype Fredbear, Springbonnie, Lolbit, and Bonnet were all on the stage. However, I noticed some movement in one of the cameras, specifically the area behind the stage where Jack Kennedy, better known as Springfreddy, shows up.\n\nI saw Burnt Luigi instead.\n\nI checked each and every one of the cameras; he was actually moving; usually in the game, it was programmed for when the characters move, it was changed to static abruptly. That didn’t happen; it was like I was watching him move in real time or something.\n\nI saw him at the office door. I tried closing it, but it acted as if the power came out until I finally closed the door shut. I literally had to double-tap the button as the first tap sounded like the door was jammed; it also felt as if my vision was becoming red, and it felt like the building was rumbling or slowly collapsing.\n\nWhen I had the door closed, I noticed how Prototype Fredbear and the others were being controlled as if they were puppets, moving, wiggling their limbs, floating in mid-air, like I am pretty sure Springbonnie is the only one capable of doing that, as hanging is like his normal behavior. I should note that from the behavior of Burnt Luigi, he seemed to have replaced Shadow Fredbear as well; hence, it looks as if I am seeing two of them at the same time since Jack Kennedy is also Burnt Luigi.\n\nThe version of Burnt Luigi that behaved like Shadow Fredbear also looked very identical to how he looked in that grayscaled image I saw in Super Mario 64.\n\nIt wasn’t as long until Burnt Luigi unfortunately entered the office. He made some unsettling, sudden, and twisty movements towards me, reaching his hand out. The next thing he did was grab my throat and hold me up. He slammed me at the arcade cabinet on my right, damaging it. Looking back at him, I was bleeding a bit. Burnt Luigi stood there as his puppets stood behind him. Prototype Fredbear, Springbonnie, Lolbit (which isn’t unusual), and Bonnet were just floating there with pitch black eyes, looking a bit sad. They floated for a moment until he stated the following:\n\nGet him.\n\nThe Vengeful Ones floated towards me, and I woke up in a sweat. I was pretty thankful I woke up from that crazy dream, but honestly, I feel like ending this post now as my heart was beating extremely quick, which could give me a heart attack and kill me. I will post more. I need to relax."},"212":{"title":"What Creepypasta ideas did you have that never came to fruition or did you just forget about them?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fq9ov7\/what_creepypasta_ideas_did_you_have_that_never\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"snowgat3","selftext":"(I had already mentioned this idea in the Creepypasta fandom but I'll say it again)\n\nI already had an idea for a Creepypasta that would be about a game that was theoretically cursed by an entity, in this case it would be Kirby Super Star.

It was an entity born of darkness and despair, a creature of the night that preyed upon the vulnerable and the innocent. They called it the Maw.\n\nThe Maw was said to dwell beneath the beds of unsuspecting victims, its presence a chilling reminder of the unseen horrors that lurk in the shadows. It fed on fear and loneliness, its power growing with each sleepless night, its influence twisting the minds of those it haunted.\n\nThe first signs of its presence were subtle: a sense of unease, a feeling of being watched, the inexplicable chill that permeated the room even on the warmest of nights. But as the Maw's influence grew, so did the manifestations of its malevolent power. Objects would move on their own, whispers would echo through the darkness, and the stench of decay would cling to the air.\n\nThe victims, often children or those already burdened by anxiety and loneliness, would become increasingly isolated, their sleep plagued by nightmares, their waking hours filled with a gnawing sense of dread. The Maw's presence became a constant, inescapable torment, its whispers a chorus of insidious suggestions and twisted promises.\n\nOne such victim was a young boy named Timmy. He was a shy and introverted child, often bullied at school and neglected at home. His only solace was his bed, a sanctuary where he could escape the harsh realities of his life. But one night, as Timmy lay awake, his mind racing with anxieties, he felt a cold touch on his ankle.\n\nHe froze, his heart pounding in his chest. He slowly turned his head, his eyes scanning the darkness beneath his bed. He saw nothing, but the feeling of being watched intensified, a chilling presence pressing down upon him.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" a voice whispered, its tone both soothing and sinister. \"I'm here to help you.\"\n\nTimmy's breath hitched in his throat. He had heard the stories, the whispered warnings of the Maw. But he was desperate, lonely, and the voice's promises of companionship and understanding were too tempting to resist.\n\nNight after night, Timmy would converse with the Maw, sharing his fears, his dreams, his deepest secrets. The entity listened patiently, its voice a comforting balm to his wounded soul. It offered him solace, validation, and a sense of belonging he had never known before.\n\nBut as Timmy's bond with the Maw deepened, so did its influence over him. His nightmares grew more vivid, his anxieties more pronounced. He became withdrawn and secretive, his once-bright eyes now filled with a haunted emptiness.\n\nHis parents, concerned by his behavior, sought help from doctors and therapists. But no one could explain Timmy's sudden transformation. The Maw's influence was subtle, its manipulation undetectable to the untrained eye.\n\nOne night, as Timmy lay in bed, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. They urged him to embrace the darkness, to surrender to the Maw's power. They promised him an end to his pain, a release from his loneliness.\n\nTimmy, his mind clouded by the entity's influence, succumbed to its seductive promises. He crawled under his bed, his hand reaching out to touch the unseen presence that awaited him.\n\nAs his fingers brushed against the cold, slimy flesh of the Maw, a surge of terror coursed through his veins. He tried to pull back, but it was too late. The Maw's grip tightened, its tentacles wrapping around his body, pulling him into the darkness beneath the bed.\n\nTimmy's screams echoed through the house, his parents rushing to his room in horror. But they were too late. The bed was empty, the only evidence of Timmy's fate a lingering stench of decay and the faint echo of his terrified cries.\n\nThe Maw had claimed another victim, its hunger for souls insatiable. It retreated back into the shadows, leaving behind a shattered family and a community gripped by fear.\n\nThe legend of the Maw spread, its story whispered in hushed tones by parents and children alike. The once-comforting sanctuary of the bed became a source of terror, a reminder of the unseen horrors that lurked in the darkness.\n\nAnd as the world slept, the Maw continued its relentless hunt, its whispers echoing through the night, its hunger for souls never sated. It became a symbol of the darkness that can consume us when we are most vulnerable, a chilling reminder that even in the safety of our own homes, we are never truly alone."},"214":{"title":"The Disappearance Files - Journal Entries of Detective Jay Jefferson","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fq0wrz\/the_disappearance_files_journal_entries_of\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"JerodJefferson","selftext":"\nJournal of Detective Jay Jefferson\n\nJuly 13th, 2007\n\nIt’s a missing person case. Routine. I’ve been handed dozens like it before. But this one’s already bothering me.\n\nThe guy’s an influencer—big in the local scene. No signs of a struggle, no trace left behind. People disappear for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes they’re running from something, sometimes toward something. But this… this feels different.\n\nHis friends said he’d become obsessed with something right before he vanished. A band. Well, not exactly. Not a band in the normal sense.\n\nHumm Kill.\n\nThat’s what they told me. At first, I figured it was just some obscure local group. Probably nothing. But the more I dig into it, the stranger it gets. No solid info, just rumors and fragments scattered across the internet. I found a couple of old, grainy concert flyers, but no one seems to remember the shows. One was from 2007—a club gig that supposedly never even happened. At least, that’s what people claim.\n\nStill, something’s not adding up here. I’ve been a cop long enough to know when something’s being buried.\n\nJuly 21st, 2007\n\nI thought I had found a lead—a message board post. Some guy was talking about how Humm Kill wasn’t just a band, but something more. A phenomenon. He said once you started looking into it, you couldn’t stop. He claimed that just trying to find out what Humm Kill was put you in danger. \n\nAt first, I laughed it off. A ghost story, I thought. But now... I’m not so sure.\n\nWeird things are happening. I’ve been losing track of time—gaps in my memory. The other night I woke up at my desk. My computer was on, the screen glowing with a search page for Humm Kill. I don’t remember starting the search. I don’t remember sitting down.\n\nBut it was there. The name.\n\nHumm Kill.\n\nJuly 26th, 2007\n\nIt’s not just me.\n\nI’ve started interviewing people—fans, other investigators who have looked into the band. Most of them are gone. Missing. The ones I managed to talk to seemed off. Hollowed out, like something was eating away at them from the inside. One woman told me she had dreams about a strange sound. A low hum that never stopped. She said it felt like her head was full of static, like something was buzzing, drowning out everything else.\n\nAnd then she stopped talking. Went dead silent.\n\nThat sound... I’ve started hearing it too.\n\nAugust 3rd, 2007\n\nI can’t stop.\n\nNo matter how much I try to push it away, I keep coming back to Humm Kill. There’s something there, something dark. It’s not just an ARG, not just some online mystery. It’s more than that. I can feel it watching me, crawling into my head. The more I dig, the stronger it gets.\n\nI found a website. Hidden. Buried beneath layers of useless pages. It didn’t look like much at first, just a simple homepage. But the longer I stared at it, the more it felt like something was staring back. There were messages, appearing and disappearing, like they were alive. One of them stuck with me.\n\n\"Humm Kill isn’t a band. It has always existed.\"\n\nI don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know. But it’s too late.\n\nAugust 10th, 2007\n\nIt’s happening.\n\nI blacked out again, lost hours, maybe a day. My partner found me at my desk, staring at the computer screen. There was nothing on it. Just static.\n\nI’ve been getting calls. No one answers when I pick up. Just that sound again, the hum. Louder this time. It’s inescapable, like it's crawling through the phone line, into my skull. I can’t focus on anything else.\n\nThey warned me about this. The people who had looked into Humm Kill... they warned me. They said once you start, you’re part of it. I thought they were crazy.\n\nBut now I know. They weren’t lying. Humm Kill has me. It’s in my head.\n\nAnd if you’re reading this……if you’ve come this far… it has you too.\n\nAugust 13th, 2007\n\nI’m done. I can’t take it anymore. The hum won’t stop.

At first, the Daisy Chain Murders seemed random—no clear motive, no connection between the victims except for one thing: daisies. Every single one of them had a daisy chain left at the scene, sometimes around their necks, sometimes placed delicately in their hands. But there’s a pattern here, a connection just beneath the surface. And I think I’ve found it.\n\nHer name is Amelia Clark. Or as her old classmates called her, \"Ame.\" \n\n---\n\nEntry 2: The First Thread\n\n\nIt started with her parents. \n\nI paid them a visit after her name popped up in some interviews—one of the victims, Ryan Mallory, knew her in college. It was a long shot, but something in my gut told me Amelia wasn’t just some random person caught up in all this.\n\nWhen I knocked on the door of the Clark residence, I didn’t expect what I found. Amelia’s mother, Karen Clark, answered the door. She was a frail woman, all nerves and wringing hands. Her eyes darted around like she expected something terrible to happen at any moment. Her husband, Richard, wasn’t much better. He sat in an armchair, staring blankly at the television, barely acknowledging my presence.\n\n“We haven’t seen Ame in years,” Karen said, her voice shaking. “Not since she ran off before high school. She was... troubled.”\n\n“Troubled how?” I asked.\n\nKaren hesitated, biting her lip. “She wasn’t like other kids. Always quiet, always in the garden, playing with those damn flowers. Daisies, mostly. She used to make those chains all the time.”\n\nThat hit me like a freight train. Daisies. Just like the murders.\n\n“She ever talk about running away?” I pressed.\n\nKaren shook her head. “Not really. But... she changed after the accident.”\n\n“What accident?”\n\nShe looked at me like I should already know. “The car accident, when she was ten. She was out playing, and the neighbor boy got hit by a car. She watched him die. After that, she wasn’t the same. It’s like... like a light went out inside her. She started spending all her time alone, making those daisy chains. And then, one day, she was gone.”\n\nHer voice cracked, and she buried her face in her hands. Richard didn’t even look up. \n\nThere was something else, something unspoken. But I didn’t push them, not yet. I had enough for now.\n\n---\n\nEntry 3: Amelia’s Web\n\nThe more I dig, the worse it gets. Ryan Mallory, one of the Daisy Chain victims, had a connection to Ame Clark. They were partnered on a college project years ago. A little more digging shows that Jake Harris, another victim, went to the same high school as Amelia. And now there’s a third—Eliza Murphy. Her brother? Same high school, same year as Amelia.\n\nThat’s no coincidence.\n\nThese killings aren’t random. They’re connected to Ame’s past. People she’s encountered, people who wronged her, maybe? But it’s too scattered, too subtle. There’s a ritual to it. The daisy chains aren’t just a signature—they’re part of something more. A ritual of control. Of innocence lost.\n\nBut what drives her? \n\n---\n\nEntry 4: The Garden\n\nI keep coming back to that garden. The one at the Clark house. \n\nI stopped by again today, watched Karen Clark tend to it, like she’s been doing for years. I asked her if Ame used to spend time there.\n\n“All the time,” Karen said. “That’s where she felt safest. She’d sit out there for hours, just weaving flowers together. We thought it was... sweet. Until she stopped talking to us. Stopped talking altogether.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked, leaning forward.\n\n“She stopped speaking to anyone. Not a word. Not after the accident. She just... stared. When we’d try to talk to her, she’d weave faster, like she was shutting us out. After a while, she’d vanish into the garden and come back with those daisy chains. I started finding them everywhere.”\n\nI could see the fear in her eyes, the way her hands shook as she spoke. “She was broken, wasn’t she? After the accident.”\n\nKaren didn’t answer, but she didn’t have to. That’s when I realized something crucial. Ame wasn’t just making daisy chains for fun. They were a form of control, of focus. And now, as an adult, that control had evolved into something far darker. \n\n---\n\nEntry 5: The Ritual\n\nThe ritual itself is still unclear, but I’m piecing it together. \n\nAme’s victims aren’t just killed—they’re arranged. Always with the daisy chain, always in a peaceful, serene position. Almost like she’s trying to preserve their innocence in death. \n\nIt’s about reclaiming innocence, I think. Her victims were people from her past, people tied to traumatic moments in her life. The daisy chains are a symbol—a twisted, perverse representation of purity and childhood. She kills them to “purify” them, to take control of their lives, the way she couldn’t control her own.\n\nBut there’s something else I can’t shake. The precision. The calm. None of these murders were done in a fit of rage. They’re cold, calculated. Almost... ritualistic. She doesn’t just kill; she completes them, turns them into art. The way she arranged Mallory’s body, with his hands clasped and the daisy chain around his neck—it’s almost like she’s offering them to something, someone.\n\nI have to find her before she kills again. \n\n---\n\nEntry 6: Confrontation\n\nI finally caught up with her. \n\nAme Clark, standing in the middle of an empty park, a daisy chain in her hands. She looked just like her old photos—dark hair, innocent face, but there was a coldness in her eyes that sent a chill down my spine. She smiled when she saw me, as if she’d been expecting me.\n\n“You’re too late,” she said softly, her voice carrying a strange calm. “It’s already done.”\n\n“What are you talking about, Ame?” I asked, keeping my distance. My hand hovered over my holster. \n\n“They weren’t innocent,” she whispered, almost to herself. “Not like the daisies. Not like me.”\n\nMy heart pounded as I realized what she meant. She wasn’t just killing them to reclaim her innocence. She was killing them to cleanse the world of their impurity. In her mind, she was the last pure thing left.\n\nI moved forward, slowly, but she raised her hand, the daisy chain dangling from her fingers. “You can’t stop the chain,” she said, her voice rising. “You can’t stop what’s already begun.”\n\nThat’s when I noticed the fresh daisies in her hand, and the faint scent of blood on the wind. \n\nAme Clark was beyond saving. \n\nI had my gun ready, but part of me hesitated. Could this girl—this quiet, broken girl—really be capable of all the horrors I’d uncovered? But as her smile widened, I knew.\n\nShe was the Daisy Chain Killer. And I was her next link.\n\nRiten bu me \nAme belongs to me Apricot Autumn "},"216":{"title":"My Toes Talked To Me ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fq69oo\/my_toes_talked_to_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"CrustyToeBro","selftext":"For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a peculiar habit of talking to myself at night. I’d roll around in bed, whispering my thoughts into the darkness, letting my mind wander into strange territories. But one night, things took a turn I never could have expected.\n\nIt started simply enough: I had kicked off my sheets and was feeling particularly restless. As I sat up in bed, I noticed a strange tingling sensation in my toes. At first, I dismissed it as a result of too many late-night snacks and poor circulation. But then, I heard it.\n\n“Hey, buddy,” a voice whispered softly. I froze, my heart racing. It was coming from my feet.\n\n“Who’s there?” I croaked, convinced I was losing my mind.\n\n“Just us, your toes,” the voice chimed again, sounding strangely cheerful. “We’ve got something to say.”\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing it to be a dream, but the voice persisted. “It’s been too long since we’ve had a real conversation, don’t you think?”\n\n“Are you serious?” I stammered, pulling my feet closer to my body as if they were a foreign object. “Toes can’t talk!”\n\n“Why not?” the voice replied with a hint of annoyance. “We’ve been here all along, and you’ve ignored us! We’ve seen things.”\n\n“Seen what?” I asked, my curiosity overcoming my fear.\n\n“Things you don’t remember,” the voice said ominously. “You don’t know what happens when you go to sleep. We do.”\n\nA chill ran down my spine as I glanced at the clock—2:47 AM. I was too exhausted to argue further. “What do you mean?” I finally asked.\n\n“Remember that time you hurt us? The accident? You never even apologized,” it continued, almost whimpering. “We’ve been waiting for you to notice.”\n\nA flood of memories rushed back: a childhood accident where I had stubbed my toes against the corner of the coffee table, the pain, the angry bruises. I had brushed it off then, but now it felt like a dark shadow lingering in my mind.\n\n“Why would I talk to my toes?” I asked, baffled.\n\n“Because we’re the ones that feel everything,” the voice replied, its tone growing more sinister. “The pain, the sorrow, the darkness that fills your life. We’re the ones who carry you through every step.”\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear the fog of fear. “I’m tired. I need to sleep.”\n\n“No, you need to listen!” my toes shouted in unison, their voices harmonizing like a twisted choir. “Tonight, we’ll show you!”\n\nSuddenly, I felt my body being pulled from the bed, my feet dragging me towards the bathroom. I tried to fight it, but I was powerless against the force of my own limbs. As I stumbled to the mirror, I saw my reflection, eyes wide with terror. My toes began to twitch violently, and before I knew it, they were tapping against the tiled floor, creating a rhythmic beat.\n\n“Join us!” they chanted, their voices echoing in my head. “Feel what we feel!”\n\nThe sensation flooded through me, and I was enveloped in darkness. I saw glimpses of my life: moments of loneliness, heartbreak, and regrets. But then came the visions of something darker—twisted shadows lurking in the corners of my mind, whispering secrets I wasn’t ready to hear.\n\nI tried to scream, but all that came out was a soundless gasp. The whispers grew louder, my toes pounding against the floor like drums, urging me to surrender to the madness.\n\nAs the darkness closed in, I finally understood the truth: I had neglected them for too long. They carried the weight of my existence, felt every ache and joy, yet I had never acknowledged their presence. The realization came too late, as my world spiraled into chaos.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up in a cold sweat, the sunlight streaming through the window. I sat up, looking around my room, half-expecting my toes to be waiting for me with more unsettling revelations. But they were quiet. I glanced down and saw nothing unusual—just my normal, everyday toes.\n\nBut I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were still there, watching, waiting. And at night, when the shadows grew long and the house fell silent, I could swear I heard faint whispers, as if they were plotting their next move, reminding me that the bond between us was now forever altered.\n\nNow, I find it hard to sleep. I fear the night, the darkness creeping in with its twisted secrets. I’m never alone; they’re always there, reminding me that every step I take is guided by the pain I once ignored.

But there's something else at play, something more sinister than neglect.\n\nThey say it's **The Entity**.\n\nUnlike the faceless figures of urban myths, The Entity is no whisper in the dark or fleeting shadow. He is a tall, unsettling figure, wearing a charcoal gray suit that seems to ripple in the shadows, melding into the darkness around him. His skin, or what remains of it, is a pale, cracked porcelain—like an old, forgotten mannequin. His eyes are hollowed out, black pits that leak an inky mist. Long, spindly fingers twitch at his sides, moving in erratic, unnatural motions. His legs are too long, like they’ve been stretched, and he hovers just above the ground as though he doesn’t need to walk.\n\nHe is not searching for children to haunt playgrounds or scare suburban neighborhoods. **The Entity preys on those society has discarded.** His victims are the forgotten: people who wander the streets at night, the runaway teens who flee abusive homes, the lonely figures in dark alleys, women whose only warmth comes from the neon lights they stand under.

In that instant of despair, when all hope fades, The Entity appears, drawn to their sorrow like a moth to flame. He doesn’t chase. He doesn’t need to. His victims feel him before they see him, an overwhelming coldness wrapping around their chest, squeezing tighter with each breath. They turn, and there he is, waiting in the distance, impossibly still.\n\nIf you run, you’ll hear him—the faint echo of footsteps, despite his floating presence. The faster you move, the closer he gets. His presence distorts everything around you. Lights flicker, shadows grow longer, and the streets twist into endless corridors with no escape. You won’t even notice when the world around you has changed—when the city disappears, leaving you in a place that shouldn’t exist. A place no one can reach.\n\nAnd then, he takes you.\n\nPeople have reported seeing the victims in their final moments—right before they disappear without a trace. They see them standing at the edge of an alley, or walking down a dark, empty street, completely alone. They’re staring into the distance, their faces slack, like they’re in a trance. Some have said that just before vanishing, the victim smiles—a hollow, broken expression—right before being swallowed by the dark.\n\nBut The Entity doesn’t just take them away. **He erases them.** There are no records, no photographs, no memories left behind. It’s as if they never existed in the first place. People who once knew them grow confused, their memories fading, their names forgotten. Within days, even those closest to the victim can’t recall their face. The only ones who remember anything are the people on the fringes of society—those who know how to look into the shadows and see what others ignore.\n\nSome say that The Entity doesn’t kill his victims. No, that would be a mercy. He keeps them somewhere—a place that no one knows how to reach, trapped in an eternal limbo, existing in the edges of reality. Some swear they’ve heard whispers late at night, soft voices of people who should be gone, crying out for help. But they’re beyond saving. Once The Entity takes you, you’re his forever.\n\nIf you’ve ever been alone in a dark place, feeling unseen and forgotten, and you catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of your vision—don’t look. Don’t turn around. Because if you see him, it’s already too late.\n\nHe’s always watching. He’s always waiting.\n\nAnd he’s always hungry for the forgotten.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo what'd ya think?"},"218":{"title":"The Midnight Screamer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fq03dg\/the_midnight_screamer\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"sisoiqadra","selftext":"\n\nI was 25, working for the mail service of El Salvador, making just enough to live alone in a tiny place on the outskirts of the city. The job wasn’t glamorous, but it paid the bills. My days were long—driving through all fourteen departments of the country, delivering packages, letters, anything people needed. By the time the sun went down, I was still on the road, heading to the far-flung towns nobody else wanted to deliver to.\n\nThat night was like any other. I had just finished my last delivery in a small town nestled in the mountains. It was a two-hour drive back home, most of it through winding roads that cut through dense forest. The kind of road where your headlights were the only light, and the darkness swallowed everything else.\n\nWhen you work at nights, it is common to lose your sleep schedule, or just plain out forget the concept of a sleep schedule. Back then I was a rookie, so my mood was always bad and I was stressed out. I was always tired, always drifting in and out of sleep behind the wheel. But that night, I was wide awake.\n\nAbout halfway through the drive, the radio cut out—just static. It wasn’t unusual out here, where signals faded quickly. The silence pressed in, heavy and unnerving, so I cracked the window, hoping the rush of cool night air would keep me alert. The wind howled through the trees, rattling the branches, but there was something…different about it that night.\n\nIt started as a distant sound, barely audible over the noise of the wind. A scream, long and piercing, but far away. At first, I thought it was some kind of animal, maybe a coyote or a bird. But the sound didn’t fade. It stayed, hanging in the air like something unnatural.\n\nI tightened my grip on the wheel, my palms sweaty. The road ahead was cloaked in fog, thick and rolling in faster than I’d ever seen. My heart pounded in my chest as the scream grew louder, like it was getting closer.\n\nI rounded a curve, and that’s when I saw him.\n\nStanding in the middle of the road, barely visible through the fog, was a figure. My headlights washed over him; just a shadow at first, but then I saw his clothes. Torn, hanging off his frame like they had been shredded by something wild. He didn’t move, didn’t flinch as the truck barreled toward him. I slammed on the brakes, tires screeching on the wet pavement.\n\nThe truck stopped just a few feet away from him. My hands shook on the steering wheel. I should have turned around, should have gunned the engine and gotten the hell out of there. But I didn’t. I couldn’t.\n\nI stared at him, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. He was tall, thin, his head bowed so I couldn’t see his face and his skin was pale, almost too pale that light from the headlights reflected on him. I figured that he was the he was somehow the source of the screaming. The scream echoed again, louder this time, and it was then that I realized…it wasn’t coming from him. It was coming from *everywhere*. The air itself seemed to vibrate with the sound, sharp and relentless.\n\nI wanted to move, to reverse the truck, but my body felt frozen, paralyzed by some primal fear I couldn’t explain. And then, slowly, the figure lifted his head.\n\nHis face, or what was left of it, was pale, glowing more than the rest of his body. His eyes were empty, dark hollows that seemed to swallow the light. His mouth twisted into a grotesque grin, and before I could react, he opened it.\n\nThe scream that followed was unlike anything I’ve ever heard. It wasn’t human. It was a force, a violent blast of sound that slammed into me like a physical weight. My ears rang, my vision blurred. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. The scream filled every part of me, ripping through my body like jagged glass. I clutched my head, trying to block out the sound, but it was inside me, tearing at my mind.\n\nI don’t know how long I sat there, trapped in the truck, the scream filling the night. When it finally stopped, I was gasping for air, drenched in sweat. The figure was gone. The road ahead was empty, the fog slowly lifting as if nothing had happened.\n\nI made it home that night, though I don’t remember the drive. I parked the truck in front of my house, my hands still shaking, my ears still ringing. I stumbled inside, collapsed on the couch, and tried to convince myself it wasn’t real. Just exhaustion. Hallucinations from lack of sleep. Stress.\n\nBut then the scream came again.\n\nAt first, it was distant, barely a whisper in the back of my mind. I’d hear it late at night, when the world was quiet, when there was nothing else to distract me. I’d lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, my eyes heavy but unable to sleep. The scream would echo faintly, growing louder, as if it was searching for me.\n\nIt didn’t stop. It followed me to work, creeping into my mind during the long drives, whispering in the silence between deliveries. Every day it got worse. The scream was always there, sometimes faint, sometimes so loud I thought I’d lose my mind. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep.\n\nI saw doctors, hoping they could explain the ringing in my ears, the phantom sounds. They told me it was stress, maybe tinnitus. They didn’t understand. Nobody did.\n\nI tried to drown it out with noise, blasting the radio, filling my house with music, but nothing worked. The scream cut through everything, relentless, inescapable. It became my constant companion, always lurking at the edge of my thoughts.\n\nNow, years later, I live with it. I have no choice. The scream never leaves, no matter where I go. It’s a part of me now. I hear it even as I write this, faint but insistent, like a distant cry carried on the wind.\n\nI survived that night, but I know I didn’t escape. One day, the scream will get louder, loud enough to drown out everything else. When that day comes, I don’t think I’ll survive again."},"219":{"title":"I have been peeing for 10 years straight ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fp0jn0\/i_have_been_peeing_for_10_years_straight\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I have been peeing in the same toilet for ten years straight. 10 years ago I went to go for a pee in my toilet, and it never stopped.

Then the media got attention and doctors examined me while I was peeing. I was fine but I was still peeing and when a year went by, I was still peeing. I was all alone in this house now, peeing till the end of time. People lost interest and now and then I get a plumber to check the toilet is still working. \n\nFunnily enough I haven't felt hunger or thirst during this peeing situation. Also when I step back further from the toilet, my pee automatically stretches to still reach the toilet. Even when I sit down in the sofa in the living room to watch TV, my pee still reaches the toilet and dodges away from objects and walls. Sometimes as I'm standing above the toilet inside the bathroom, I start thinking about certain events in my life. \n\nI started thinking about my first marriage and how it only lasted a month. It was going well until I woke in the hospital bed as i had survived the head shot wound that I did to myself, but my wife didn't survive it and we both shot each other as a pact. Then I started thinking about the violent country I came from. I remember good people were being arrested for literally anything. Be it accidental littering or having to run across the road to reach something. \n\nAll the while murderers, thieves and other big time criminals got away with anything. When I got sent to jail for accidental littering, I was so sad. Then when I got to jail I was pleasantly surprised to find every good person in jail. It wasn't a jail but a haven from the world outside. I smiled to myself at that thought. \n\nIt's been ten years and I've been peeing in the same toilet. That noise it makes when the pee hits the water, has numbed my ears that sometimes I don't hear it anymore. The world has changed in ten years and there have been so many wars and financial crashes but I'm still here peeing. \n\nWhen burglars tried robbing my home I started running outside while my pee was still reaching the toilet and dodging objects. Then when I went back to my home, my pee was still in the process of strangling all of the burglars. \n\nThey were all dead and as the dropped the ground, my pee was still reaching the toilet.

Para mí, no eran más que cuentos viejos, hechos para asustar a los niños y mantenerlos alejados del bosque. Pero todo cambió esa tarde de otoño, cuando decidí adentrarme más allá de los límites del sendero, donde nadie en su sano juicio solía ir.\n\nEl bosque tenía una atmósfera extraña. Los árboles parecían más altos y las ramas más retorcidas a medida que me adentraba. El aire se volvía denso, casi irrespirable, y el suelo estaba cubierto de hojas secas que crujían bajo mis pies, aunque el eco de mis pasos parecía disiparse en el silencio absoluto que me rodeaba. No había pájaros cantando, ni el sonido del viento entre las hojas. Solo un inquietante silencio.\n\nMe sentía observado, aunque cada vez que me giraba, no había nadie. Seguí caminando, más por testarudez que por curiosidad, hasta que llegué a un claro. Y allí fue donde todo comenzó.\n\nHabía un pequeño círculo de setas en el centro del claro. Mis abuelos siempre decían que esos círculos eran puertas a \"otro lugar\", un lugar donde los duendes jugaban con las almas de los que se atrevían a cruzar. Me reí nerviosamente de esa idea y me acerqué más. Las setas parecían normales al principio, pero había algo raro en la disposición: eran demasiado perfectas, demasiado simétricas.\n\nDe repente, el silencio del bosque se rompió. Oí risas. Risas agudas, casi infantiles, pero llenas de algo… oscuro. Miré a mi alrededor, pero no vi a nadie. Sin embargo, el sonido parecía venir de todas partes. Mi corazón empezó a latir más rápido. Retrocedí, alejándome del círculo, pero algo en el aire cambió.\n\nNoté movimiento en el borde del claro. Algo pequeño, rápido, apenas visible, se escabullía entre las sombras. Mis ojos intentaban seguir las figuras, pero cada vez que me enfocaba en una, desaparecía. Sentí un frío inexplicable en la nuca. Sabía que no estaba solo.\n\nIntenté dar la vuelta y regresar, pero mi cuerpo no me obedecía. Entonces, lo vi. Una pequeña figura, no más alta que mis rodillas, salió de entre los árboles. Su piel era grisácea, como la corteza de un árbol, y sus ojos brillaban con un tono amarillo enfermizo. Sonreía, pero no era una sonrisa amigable. Era una mueca torcida, llena de maldad.\n\nNo estaba solo. De las sombras salieron más. Eran pequeños, con cuerpos delgados y huesudos, y sus risas agudas resonaban en mi cabeza. Me rodearon, bailando y cantando en un idioma que no podía entender. El miedo me paralizó, pero no podía dejar de mirar sus rostros deformes.\n\nUno de ellos se acercó más, tan cerca que pude sentir su aliento frío en mi piel. Sus ojos brillaban con una mezcla de curiosidad y malicia. En su mano, sostenía algo que no pude identificar, pero sentí un terror profundo, como si supiera que lo que tenía era para mí.\n\nIntenté moverme, correr, gritar, pero mis pies estaban clavados al suelo. Era como si el bosque mismo me estuviera sujetando, impidiéndome escapar. Las risas se volvieron más fuertes, ensordecedoras, y los duendes empezaron a acercarse cada vez más, como si estuvieran disfrutando de mi miedo.\n\nEntonces, uno de ellos, el más pequeño, dio un paso adelante y, con una voz chillona, susurró algo que me heló la sangre: \"Te quedas con nosotros\". Y en ese momento, sentí como si algo invisible me estuviera arrastrando hacia el círculo de setas.\n\nMis ojos se cerraron, y lo último que recuerdo es el sonido de sus risas. Cuando desperté, estaba de nuevo en el sendero, justo al borde del bosque. No sé cómo llegué allí, ni cuánto tiempo estuve en el claro. Pero desde ese día, algo cambió en mí. A veces, en la quietud de la noche, puedo escuchar esas risas otra vez. Y lo peor es que, cuando estoy solo en mi casa, siento que me observan, esperando… esperando a que vuelva.\n\n"},"225":{"title":"i asked for no onions but he gave me onions ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fpbvp0\/i_asked_for_no_onions_but_he_gave_me_onions\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Infinite-Ostrich8245","selftext":"Grant's apartment was suffocating. The walls, once pale, had turned gray from years of neglect, reflecting the gloom that weighed on him daily. He sat at his rickety desk, staring at the flickering computer screen. Job application after job application lay scattered in his inbox rejected, ignored, or worse, \"we'll keep your resume on file.\"\n\nHe was only 19, but life had already started to feel stagnant. After dropping out of community college, he'd thrown himself into finding a job. Any job. But nothing seemed to work. Retail stores, fast food joints, even manual labor gigs all places where people his age seemed to land something. But not him. Weeks of trying had turned into months. His friends were moving forward college, jobs, relationships but Grant remained stuck in the same bleak cycle. \n\nHis phone vibrated on the desk, bringing a brief moment of hope. He grabbed it quickly, swiping through the notification, only to see another \"Thanks, but no thanks\" email. His shoulders sagged as he tossed the phone onto the bed. The rejection was like a punch to the gut, one he had grown used to but couldn't shake. \n\nThe days all blurred together, a monotony of failed attempts and aimless hours scrolling through social media, watching others live lives he couldn’t touch. The loneliness gnawed at him, a constant ache that never left. His family rarely called anymore probably tired of hearing the same story: \"No, I didn't get the job.\" He hadn’t talked to any friends in months. Not that it mattered; they’d moved on. \n\nThe only thing that hadn't abandoned him was the creeping feeling of isolation. Sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd catch himself staring at the gun in his closet, hidden under an old stack of laundry. It was his father's, a relic of a time when things made more sense, a time when he thought life was going somewhere. He wasn't sure why he kept it around maybe as a reminder of control, maybe something darker.\n\nGrant shook the thoughts away and picked up his phone again, this time scrolling through job postings, mindlessly applying to anything that looked even remotely plausible. A construction job no experience required. A delivery driver position must have reliable transportation (which he didn't). A data entry job that paid next to nothing but offered a glimmer of hope.\n\nHours passed, and the sun outside dipped below the horizon. The blue glow of his screen was the only light in the room now. His stomach growled, but the thought of eating felt like too much effort. The weight of everything bore down on him like a lead blanket, dragging him further into a mental fog. \n\nHe rubbed his eyes and stood, stretching his legs. His phone buzzed again, vibrating closer to the edge of the bed. He turned toward it, stepping forward just as the phone slipped off the edge. It tumbled in slow motion, landing face first on the cold hardwood floor with a sickening crack.\n\nGrant froze. His heart sank as he picked it up, flipping it over to reveal the shattered screen. A jagged spiderweb of cracks spread across the glass, the display flickering with broken pixels.\n\n\"Great,\" he muttered to himself. \"Just great.\"\n\nHis phone, his lifeline to the outside world, was now ruined. He held it in his hands, staring at the broken device as if it embodied everything wrong with his life. How was he supposed to keep applying for jobs now? How would anyone reach him? \n\nA wave of frustration and helplessness surged through him. His hands tightened around the phone as if he wanted to crush it further, but he stopped short, letting out a long, ragged breath.\n\nGrant tossed the phone onto his desk, where it lay lifeless, flickering weakly like the last ember of hope in his gut. The room seemed darker now, quieter, the silence pressing in on him like an unwanted visitor. He glanced toward the closet, where the gun lay hidden, but quickly looked away.\n\nThe next day, Grant found himself at the mall not because he wanted to be there, but because the isolation in his apartment felt suffocating. His phone, now a useless chunk of glass and metal, weighed heavy in his pocket. He figured he’d visit a repair kiosk; maybe they’d tell him it was beyond saving, but at least it was something to do. Anything to escape the crushing silence that enveloped him at home.\n\nAs he wandered through the mall, the atmosphere was dull and familiar. The day started like any other, but it took a turn for the worse quickly. Grant tried to keep his head low, hoping to go unnoticed, but fate had other plans. As he passed a group of guys lounging near the food court, he heard it the snickers, the hushed whispers. He knew it was directed at him.\n\n“Yo, isn’t that the guy who couldn’t even get a job at a gas station?” one of them sneered loudly enough for Grant to hear. \n\nAnother one laughed. “Nah, man, I heard his mommy still pays his rent.”\n\nGrant kept walking, but they weren’t done. They followed him, their voices growing louder.\n\n“Hey, loser, you got any money, or are you still living off scraps?”\n\n“Bet he’s got a phone, though. Gotta keep up with all those rejection emails, right?” They cackled, closing in. \n\nBefore Grant could get away, one of them grabbed his arm, spinning him around. “Why don’t you go home and cry to your mirror, huh? Or are you too busy trying to figure out how to tie a noose?”\n\nThe words stung. Grant yanked his arm free, his heart pounding in his ears. He wanted to lash out, to scream, but he didn’t. He never did. Instead, he just hurried away, their mocking laughter echoing behind him, following him through the mall like a shadow. By the time he got home, the humiliation had turned into a deep, burning anger.\n\nLater that night, as he lay in bed, the broken phone on his desk was the least of his concerns. He stared at the ceiling, replaying the events in his mind. Every insult, every shove it all just piled on top of the rejection he faced every day.\n\nHe rolled over, glancing at the phone out of habit, when suddenly, the room filled with a soft pink glow. The phone had turned on. It was impossible. The screen had been completely shattered. Grant sat up, confused, watching as the cracks in the glass smoothed out like they’d never been there at all.\n\nOn the screen was an unfamiliar app, a dating app, glowing in soft pink and white. Its logo, a heart wrapped in delicate vines, pulsed like it was alive. A single name hovered in the middle of the screen, waiting for him to swipe: \\*\\**~~Michael~~* Mikey\\*\\*.\n\nThe name seemed strange, unfamiliar, almost ancient. There was no last name, no information, just her picture a girl with deep, piercing eyes and an almost otherworldly beauty. Her dark hair framed her face perfectly, and her smile was soft, yet there was something off about it, something Grant couldn’t put his finger on.\n\nHe tapped “Match” almost instinctively, and the screen blinked, opening a chat window. A message from   Mikey appeared almost instantly.\n\n\\*\\*\"Hey :) How’s your night going?\"\\*\\*\n\nGrant hesitated before responding. This whole thing felt... strange. \n\n\\*\\*\"Do I know you?\"\\*\\* he typed, trying to shake the unease creeping over him.\n\nHer reply came quickly.\n\n\\*\\*\"Not yet, but we’re a perfect match.\"\\*\\* \n\nThe conversation flowed easily after that. She asked him simple questions about his day, about his life. Grant found himself answering, despite how odd it felt. There was something about her that pulled him in, something comforting in her attention. But every time he asked her about herself, she gave vague, almost empty responses.\n\nWhen he asked where she was from, she typed: \\*\\*\"Closer than you think.\"\\*\\*\n\nHis skin prickled. He tried to shake it off, dismissing it as nothing more than a weird AI chatbot.\n\n\\*\\*\"We should meet,\"\\*\\* she said after a while. \\*\\*\"I’d love to see you in person.\"\\*\\*\n\nGrant’s heart skipped a beat. The thought of meeting someone from an app especially someone like her made his stomach twist. He hadn’t been good with people for a while, and something about her, her perfectness, felt off.\n\n\\*\\*\"I don’t think that’s a good idea,\"\\*\\* he typed. \\*\\*\"I mean, you’re probably just some AI or something, right?\"\\*\\*\n\nThere was a long pause before her next message came through.\n\n\\*\\*\"Does it matter, Grant? You’re lonely. Don’t you want company?\"\\*\\*\n\nA chill ran down his spine. He hadn’t given the app his name. He was sure of it.\n\nJust then, the old, broken radio on his dresser sputtered to life, static filling the room before a voice cut through, faint and crackling: “Authorities are still searching for a missing person last seen in the downtown area. No further details have been released.”\n\nThe message was unsettlingly vague, but Grant couldn’t focus on it. His attention snapped back to the phone, to the chat.\n\n\\*\\*\"How do you know my name?\"\\*\\* he typed, his hands shaking.\n\nThe screen flickered for a moment before her response appeared.\n\n\\*\\*\"I know a lot about you. But don’t worry, I won’t hurt you. I just want to watch over you.\"\\*\\*\n\nHis blood ran cold. He threw the phone down, scrambling out of bed, his pulse racing. This had to be some sort of nightmare. He rubbed his eyes, trying to wake himself up, but when he opened them, she was there.\n\nStanding at the edge of his bed, in the dim light of his room, was\"Mikey.\n\nShe wasn’t smiling anymore. Her eyes, those deep, endless eyes, were fixed on him, unblinking. Grant couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. His throat tightened as terror gripped him.\n\nShe didn’t leave. She just stood there, watching him. Hours passed, or maybe it was minutes time felt irrelevant under her gaze. When morning light finally crept through the window, she was still there, still watching.\n\nThe radio crackled again. “The missing person… no leads yet… authorities urge caution.” The voice droned on, but Grant could barely hear it over the pounding in his head.\n\nThe phone buzzed in his hand. A new message from\"Mikey.\n\n\\*\\*\"You looked so peaceful while you slept.\"\\*\\*\n\nThe next day dawned gray and heavy, mirroring Grant’s mood.   Mikey was still in his room, perched on the edge of his bed, her presence oddly calming after the terror of the previous night. Despite the dread she stirred in him, he found himself too exhausted to confront her. So he just stared at her, trying to wrap his mind around what had happened.\n\n“Good morning!” she chirped, her voice bright and cheery, a stark contrast to the heavy silence of his thoughts.\n\nHe blinked. “You how are you still here?” \n\n“I told you, I just want to be with you,” she replied, her smile unwavering. “Is that so bad?”\n\nGrant rubbed his temples, fighting off the urge to panic. He wanted to scream, to push her away, but a part of him was drawn to her. She seemed so genuine, so... real, even if he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that she wasn’t entirely human.\n\nAs the day went on, Grant tried to act like everything was normal, but having her shadowing him made it difficult. At first, he thought she’d stay behind, but she followed him everywhere into the bathroom, down the hall, even into the kitchen when he tried to grab a bite.\n\n“Can I make you something?” she asked, peering into the fridge with curiosity.\n\n“No, that’s fine,” he muttered, pulling out a half eaten sandwich that had been there too long. He took a bite, trying to ignore the strange way she watched him.\n\nWhen he finally decided to venture outside, he hoped the fresh air would clear his head. But as he stepped onto the sidewalk,   Mikey was right beside him, her expression innocent and curious as if she had every right to be there. \n\nAt the corner deli, the usual daily grind welcomed him, the familiar faces of the workers offering little comfort. He stood in line, mindlessly scanning the menu until it was his turn.\n\n“I’ll have a cheeseburger with no onions, please,” he said, fighting against the sense of isolation that had become all too familiar.\n\n“Coming right up!” the cashier replied with a smile, and Grant stepped aside, trying to focus on the sound of the chatter around him. He could feel\"Mikey’s eyes on him, a warm, comforting presence. \n\nBut then, just as the food arrived, a group of guys from the mall bumped into him, pushing him back without so much as a word of apology. He stumbled slightly, the burger nearly slipping from his hands.\n\n“Watch it, loser!” one of them sneered, their laughter echoing in his ears like an unwelcome soundtrack.\n\n  Mikey stepped forward, but instead of confronting them, she just studied the group with an intensity that made Grant uneasy. He could feel her eyes darting between their faces, taking in their every move.\n\n“Still hanging around this pathetic excuse for a human, huh?” one of them laughed, and they pushed past him, leaving him feeling even more isolated.\n\nHe stood there, the weight of their words sinking in as he tried to eat his burger, but it tasted like cardboard.   Mikey hovered nearby, her presence both comforting and unsettling. \n\n“Why do they treat you like this?” she asked, genuinely confused, still observing the bullies as they walked away.\n\n“It’s just how it is,” Grant mumbled, shoving a bite of burger into his mouth. “I’ve gotten used to it.”\n\nHer eyes softened, and she tilted her head as she watched him. “But you shouldn’t have to.”\n\nThe day dragged on, and everywhere Grant went, she was there, almost like a shadow. She didn’t seem to understand human interactions, often smiling too brightly at strangers or trying to chat with them, only to receive blank stares or snide remarks in return. \n\nIt was exhausting, and eventually, he found himself just accepting that she wouldn’t leave him. \n\n\"Mikey,” he finally said as they walked home, “I don’t know what you are or why you’re here, but you… you don’t have to stay with me. I can handle this on my own.”\n\nShe stopped walking, her expression shifting to something more serious. “But you don’t have to be alone,” she said softly. “I want to help you.”\n\n“Help me?” he scoffed, but his heart wasn’t in it. “You think just being here is helping?”\n\n“Yes!” she said, her voice firm yet gentle. “You’re not alone anymore, Grant. You have me.”\n\nAnd as he looked into her eyes, a part of him craved that connection. It had been so long since someone cared, even if it was in a bizarre way. Perhaps the comfort of her presence was worth the strangeness of the situation.\n\n“Fine,” he conceded, a weary acceptance settling over him. “But you can’t just ”\n\n“ I promise I’ll protect you!” she cut in, her excitement palpable.\n\nBut as they walked the rest of the way home, the radio in the corner of his room crackled again, a distant voice warning about the missing persons case, its words echoing in the background of his empty room. \n\nThe morning light filtered through the thin curtains of Grant's bedroom, casting soft, golden beams across the worn wooden floor. The air was still, almost serene, as if the world had momentarily paused. He could hear the distant hum of the city waking up outside cars moving, birds chirping, and the faint, rhythmic pulse of life. For a brief moment, it felt like peace. Grant stood by the window, staring out, letting the warmth of the sun momentarily distract him from the heavy thoughts that had been plaguing him for days. \n\n  Mikey lounged on the couch, her posture unnaturally relaxed, like she belonged there, like she had always been part of his world. She watched the TV with childlike fascination, her eyes wide and unblinking as the morning talk shows droned on. The room felt... normal, in the strangest sense. For a fleeting second, it was almost as though he could pretend everything was okay. He moved to the bed, his body heavy with exhaustion, the weight of sleepless nights pressing down on his shoulders. As he sat, he glanced over at the TV, intending to change the channel, but then he froze.\n\nThe screen flickered, cutting from a cheery advertisement to breaking news. The headline was abrupt, but it was the images that sent a cold wave of dread crashing over him. The faces five of them flashed in sequence, each staring back at him with lifeless eyes. He knew these faces.\n\nThe first was the guy from the mall, the one who had laughed as his buddies shoved Grant around. Then another face someone from the deli. The cashier. His mind spiraled as the pictures blurred together, all of them now familiar, all of them people who had crossed him, insulted him, wronged him in some small way. His heart began to pound, the room that once felt serene now suffocating. The air felt thick, tainted. \n\nThe soft hum of the city was no longer comforting it sounded like a distant wail, like a warning. The golden light that once warmed his skin now seemed harsh and sterile, spotlighting the grim reality in front of him. His throat tightened as panic rose inside him, bile bubbling up as the world around him twisted into something unrecognizable. The soft creak of the floor under his feet became a menacing groan, like the house itself was warping. The once peaceful air now stank of something rotten, something foul. His pulse hammered in his ears, each beat louder than the last.\n\nHe turned slowly to look at\"Mikey, whose gaze was still locked on the screen. She hadn’t moved. But she didn’t need to. The truth slammed into him with brutal force. She was connected to this, to them. His legs trembled as his mind raced, piecing together fragments of terrifying thoughts. His eyes darted around the room, seeking an escape, a way to distance himself from the monstrous reality that was now creeping toward him. \n\nHe bolted from the bed, snatching his keys off the dresser. \"I need to get out,\" he muttered to himself, heart pounding in his throat. As he rushed toward the door,   Mikey turned her head with eerie slowness, her eyes gleaming with something unnatural.\n\n“Where are you going?” she asked, her voice unnervingly calm, like a predator toying with its prey. Her sudden movement startled him, a dark echo in the quiet room. She didn’t approach, but something about her presence felt... off. Unnatural.\n\n“Just... for a walk,” he muttered, his voice shaking, trying to sound casual, but he could feel the weight of her gaze on him, burning into his skin.\n\n“I wanna come,” she replied, her tone too eager, too excited.\n\n“No!” Grant’s voice cracked with desperation as he flung the door open and sprinted into the hallway, slamming it shut behind him. His feet pounded against the carpeted floor as he raced toward the stairs, his mind a chaotic storm of fear and confusion. \n\n\"What am I going to do?\" he whispered under his breath, heart pounding, as he reached the top of the staircase. But as he turned the corner, his blood turned to ice.\n\n  Mikey was standing there, at the bottom of the stairs, grinning up at him like a shadow that had crept into his reality. His legs wobbled, his breath caught in his throat as the world around him seemed to tilt. How had she ?\n\nHe stumbled back, scrambling up the stairs, trying to escape. He tore down the hallway, but the dread was choking him. Bursting back into his apartment, he slammed the door shut behind him, locking it. His chest heaved as he backed away, but the moment he turned around, she was already there.\n\nSitting on the couch, smiling.\n\n“Welcome home,” she grinned, her lips parting to reveal teeth stained red, blood pooling in her gums. His stomach churned, revulsion curling up his spine.\n\nHe backed into the wall, curling down in a defensive crouch. But then, something strange happened. She didn’t advance. She just stood there, watching him. Waiting.\n\n“Sit,” he muttered, testing the waters of her obedience.\n\nAnd, unnervingly, she obeyed.\n\nGrant stared at her, disbelief clouding his judgment. His voice trembled as he whispered, “What are you?”\n\nAs she backed up, her hair began to grow wildly, twisting and tangling, her eyes widening grotesquely until they bulged from her skull, veins pulsing as they turned bloodshot. Her breathing grew erratic, sharp gasps filling the air. With a slow, unsettling stretch, she dropped into a downward dog position, her spine cracking as her shoulder blades violently jutted out. A sickening, wet pop echoed in the room, followed by her agonized scream, sharp enough to make the walls seem to close in. From her back, massive wings tore through the skin, leathery and scarred, the edges seared as if burned in some ancient fire.\n\nThe stench of decay hit like a wave, suffocating and thick, as she straightened herself, her form now towering and inhuman. Her hands trembled as she gripped her forearm tightly, her claws digging into the flesh. Without hesitation, she ripped the skin away in a jagged motion, the sound of tearing meat almost unbearable. Blood poured to the floor in thick, dark rivulets, its odor acrid, like sulfur mixed with rot. Beneath the shredded skin, her arm was nothing but ragged sinew and jagged bone, her fingers warped into gnarled claws, each tipped with a razor sharp talon.\n\nWith a crazed look in her bloodshot eyes, she seized her other arm, repeating the grotesque ritual. Flesh hung in blood soaked tatters as her second arm was revealed just as twisted and horrific, with jagged shards of bone tearing through. Chunks of rotting muscle clung to the exposed bone, dripping thick, blackish blood that pooled at her feet, its stench of decay and sulfur almost unbearable. Every breath she took rattled with a low, guttural growl. \n\nHer voice was no longer soft it was a rasping growl that sent shivers down Grant’s spine. “This is what I am.”\n\nGrant’s throat tightened as he gasped for air, his mind barely comprehending the horror unfolding in front of him. “Why? Why me? Why them?” His voice was barely a whisper, his heart hammering so hard he thought it might burst.\n\n“Because, Grant,”   Mikey rasped, her breath foul and rancid. “You wanted this. Deep down, you wanted them to suffer.” She stepped closer, her claws dragging across the floor, leaving deep gouges in the wood. “I just did what you couldn't.” \n\nHe recoiled, bile rising in his throat. “You killed them!” His voice cracked with hysteria, the reality suffocating him.\n\n“I tore them apart,” she grinned, her eyes glinting with malice. “Bit by bit, I savored every scream, every tear of flesh. Eight hours, nine hours it’s plenty of time for someone to scream themselves hoarse, don’t you think?”\n\nGrant could barely think, his mind fraying at the edges. “Please... don’t kill anyone else. Stop.”\n\n“You wanted it,” she whispered, stepping closer, her claws barely grazing his skin, her breath cold against his neck. “Somewhere in that twisted mind of yours, you thought it. You wished they were dead.” She paused, her voice dark and dripping with venom. “I’m just making your wishes come true.”\n\nPanic surged through Grant like a bolt of lightning, his breath hitching in his throat as he scrambled backward, his limbs uncooperative and clumsy. His heart pounded with such force it felt like it might burst through his chest. The grotesque creature standing before him twisted, skin still sloughing from its jagged bones as its bloodshot eyes locked onto him with a hungry, manic gleam. Every instinct screamed at him to run, but his legs felt heavy, almost glued to the floor in terror. \n\nHe finally tore himself free from the paralysis, stumbling over a chair in his frantic bid to reach the hallway. His foot caught on the edge of the rug, sending him sprawling face first into the floor. The cold wood slapped against his palms, the sharp sting pulling him back to reality. He glanced over his shoulder, the twisted figure of   Mikey advancing toward him, her claws dragging along the ground, the tips scratching deep into the floor with an eerie screech. She didn't rush; she moved methodically, as if savoring his panic.\n\nGrant scrambled to his feet, his mind racing but unfocused, fighting against the primal fear. He pushed off the floor and bolted for the hallway, his hands slipping on the doorframe as he yanked himself through, his knees buckling beneath him. Behind him, her raspy breathing filled the air, a mix of low growls and wet, sickening gurgles. He didn’t dare look back, but he could feel her looming presence just feet away, her shadow crawling across the walls as if it had a life of its own.\n\nThe hallway stretched before him, too long, too narrow. His room was just at the end, but it felt miles away. He could hear her behind him, her claws scraping against the walls, leaving deep gashes that splintered the wood. His legs burned with each step, and the sheer terror turned his body sluggish, each movement slower than it should’ve been.\n\nHe reached the door to his bedroom just as he felt a sharp tug at his shirt. Her claws snagged the fabric, tearing it with a loud rip. He yelped in surprise, instinctively throwing himself forward as she stumbled just behind him. Her breath, hot and reeking of decay, grazed the back of his neck, and the walls seemed to close in, trapping him in this moment of pure, suffocating terror. \n\nWith trembling hands, he slammed his shoulder against his bedroom door, bursting into the room and slamming it shut just as her claws scraped the other side. The impact was so hard it rattled the frame, nearly knocking him off balance. He stood there, gasping for air, his back pressed against the door, feeling her presence just inches away. Her claws scratched at the wood with a slow, deliberate rhythm, like she was testing the strength of the barrier. Each scrape sounded like nails on a chalkboard, but worse so much worse. The sound of splintering timber filled the air as she started to tear into the door, her strength relentless.\n\nGrant's breath came in ragged gasps as he pushed himself off the door and bolted for the closet. His fingers fumbled with the handle, his mind spinning, every second feeling like an eternity. The door creaked open just as a thunderous crack echoed behind him the doorframe was splintering. She was getting in.\n\n\"Come on, come on!\" he muttered to himself in sheer desperation, his hands shaking uncontrollably as he reached inside the closet. His fingers brushed the cold metal of the gun, and he yanked it out with a clumsy swipe, nearly dropping it in his panic. His heart slammed against his ribs, the weapon trembling in his grasp as he spun around, aiming toward the door, expecting her monstrous form to come barreling through at any second.\n\nThe door groaned and buckled under the weight of her assault, but she didn’t break through. The scraping stopped suddenly, leaving an eerie, suffocating silence in its wake. Grant held his breath, his grip tightening on the gun, every muscle in his body tensed, waiting for the inevitable crash of the door.\n\nBut it didn’t come.\n\nInstead, there was a soft, deliberate tapping, a sick mockery of a knock\n\nHer head peeked through the gap, her smile widening with sadistic delight.\n\n\\*Bang.\\*\n\nThe bullet hit her square in the forehead, but her expression didn’t change. She grinned, the wound sealing itself within moments, leaving no trace of injury.\n\nDespair gnawed at him. In a moment of pure desperation, he turned the gun on himself, his hands shaking as he squeezed the trigger.\n\n\\*Bang.\\*\n\nEverything went black.\n\nBut when he opened his eyes, she was still there.\n\nGrinning. Waiting."},"226":{"title":"SONIC3&amp;KNUCKLES","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fprg47\/sonic3knuckles\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"PeridotIsBestGem","selftext":"Hello.

The first 3 levels were normal, angel island, yada yada yada. But, when i got to the casino zone, knuckles was acting really weird.

I decided to visit my parents for the weekend, and when i came back, my wallpaper was black, with red text\n\n\"What do you think your doing?\" It said.

He was my friend, and he was the first person to try and help me survive the life of hopping freight trains. That’s how things go for us, they change often and suddenly. I had to do bad things in order to not follow him. Well, those guys that gave him the toss did bad things to me… they were definitely done to me. I had to let them.\n\nI was just seventeen then, so it had to have been about ten years ago? I don’t really keep track of days like most people. Could be more or less, doesn’t matter, the fact is he wasn’t the only person I’ve seen kilt. It's not the life my parents had planned for me, neither. They had good jobs, good homes and good intentions. The intentions flew out the window once my brother was born deformed. Then they had none of those things, as the medical bills, anger and a forgotten little boy helped collapse the foundation of that home. I doubt they even alerted the police when they realized I was gone. Better to be rid of the demon child with higher expectations than being a caretaker.\n\nIt was unfair of them to assume I would grow up to take care of Jacob when they died. They never even bothered to ask me, I could just see it. What else was I supposed to interpret finding my torn up acceptance letters in the garbage as, no doubt they left them there for me to find. The last straw was a home-cooked meal, hosting my dad’s boss from the factory… coaxing me down the path into his nightmare with a promise of a job in exchange for servitude. Fuck that you dead-eyed, flannel clad, zombie. \n\nI was not prepared for that decision, and it took me a long time to come to grips with it. Suburbia had not raised me for the harsh reality that awaits someone who wonders on railcars. It’s fucking brutal. It would have been easier to get a Xanax prescription and become the drone my parents raised me to be, but my heart wasn’t into that. I don’t do drugs at all in fact. \n\nIt probably stems from watching a guy named Stu arrive in Portland one arm light and low on blood. Fucker decided to take PCP **IN** our railcar and **FLIPPED OUT.** Ended up ripping open the door, just green trees whizzing by, and sticking his arm out to grab onto them. This impressive act of courageous idiocy flung him back against the door and separated his body from his arm at the shoulder. I listened to him scream the rest of the way, and pondered whether it would have been better had he not stayed in the car, and just flown out with his arm. Being dead might be better than being a one armed bum. He did not appreciate my suggestion that he add “wounded vet” to his panhandling schtick, and moaned at me about it. I didn’t care, what was he gonna do, fight me?\n\nObviously, the question as to the appeal of this life is a constant point of discussion, usually over firelight and communal pint of cheap booze. Why do you do this dangerous lonely thing? The answer is universal but comes in different forms. Best I can come up with, we are all just pieces of the wrong puzzle, in a box with a picture we don’t match, bought at a second hand store for five bucks. Perhaps we are all looking for our right box out here. \n\nMy reason… My favorite part, I guess, is the time in the railcar, with the door ajar, just watching the scenery fly by as I have deep conversation with a complete stranger, while tugging on a pint bottle. Being alone is fine, but interviewing the dark souls of wanderers by torch light is what gets me going. Their stories are better than yours, their philosophy has been tested in ways your average person will never. \n\nYour average person will never have to say a prayer, hoping that the person you're about to ride, alone and illegally with, for an unknown number of hours isn’t high on meth and violent… or god forbidden horny. Deep shit bonus points if they’re all those things and armed. \n\nBut that is not why I’m bothering to write this post, on a phone that I stole from a gas station attendant. I need to warn you never to ride in railcar UUH17.\n\nOf all the advice I received in my life in the wild, the most bullshit piece was about the red boxcar UUH17. Every few years I’d meet someone and they would warn me to choose any other car if you see the face of the devil. That was the only similarity between these encounters. The rest of the story was always different, and obviously fake.  I laughed at them.\n\nA guy westbound from Gatlinburg told me it was filled with spiders. Another, while we baked in a stalled boxcar outside Phoenix, claimed he nearly drowned when water started to pour from the ceiling…This man lied to my face in the middle of the desert! I always saw through them, no matter how hysterical they became, they were just some jackass trying to pass a scary story off like real experience. After Phoenix, not three weeks later, I heard from this lady that she watched her brother melt on the way to Tallahassee, and I had had it. \n\nMelt… like a chocolate bar in the fucking sun. It was then I vowed to ride every car I saw with a Devil graffitied on the side of it. If that was an option, that’s what I aimed for. I thought it fitting, considering what my parents used to call me. The demon child... in a demon car. Badass.\n\nThey were always specific about UUH17, but I had never bothered to look at the numbers anyways… who gives a fuck what they’re called, so I just decided I might as well make it my thing. Eventually, if it were gonna show up, it would; and so it became muscle memory to ride with the devil. \n\nUUH17 caught me leaving Sacramento, headed back to Portland. Hell, for all I know, I probably passed Stu’s decomposed arm inside it. I had completely forgotten of its existence at this point; a condition I would never be able to enjoy again. I remember thinking the face on the side was a lot more elaborate than any other I had seen. It had unsettled me as I hopped on and slammed the door home to my own personal hellscape. \n\nI have worked for a long time to repress this ride, but no amount of brown liquor could wipe clean its memory completely. Bits and pieces of it come back to me in moments of idle silence, causing me to yell like a wounded and afraid coyote. \n\nMy mother and father were in railcar UUH17 along with me. Them and that thing they call their son. They grew monstrous out of the shadows and into the dark lantern light, tall and hollow looking. Doting on that creation, that grotesque mound of stinking flesh. All they could do was cater to its every snarl, cooing at its horrendousness. A recreation of my childhood home grew up the walls of the car, before my very eyes. I was in a dimly lit version of the place I had run away from my entire life. My parents strapped me down to my childhood kitchen table and fed my leg to my mutant brother. I watched them do it, they propped my head up so that was all I could see. I felt them cutting into me, sawing away like lumberjacks into my meat and bones. I screamed at them, begged them to let me go, but they only smiled at me and the baby. Shushing me and praising me for being a good brother. \n\nI was found in the railyard nearly dead and carted away to the local hospital. The official report states I fell on the track and an oncoming train gave me a permanent hop, which is such complete bullshit. Those dumb fuck railyard bulls know my stump wasn’t a clean cut, even the doctors said it looked like it was cut away with a steak knife. No, everyone knows you don't have to care about someone who doesn’t pay taxes. Just patch him up and get him the out of your sight, eh? Just another dirty face on the sidewalk. Vagabond. Bum. Get the fuck out of here. Never mind what has happened to me, never mind what I’ve seen.\n\nI stopped rail jumping after that. It was impossible anyway, with only one leg. At least that’s the excuse I told myself when I try to be willfully ignorant. Now I’m just a bum. A bum, amputee in his late twenties with a cardboard sign that says “Iraq took everything from me”. \n\nPlease, if you see me or my sign, drop a buck or two, it’ll really help. Maybe I should figure out a gofundme or something. Anything to help me raise cash so I can get headed down south. There is no way I can stay in this rail system. \n\nYou see, I’ve seen UUH17 four times in the past month, here around Seattle, and it feels too risky to think that’s a coincidence, especially because I stay far from train tracks. That’s why I’m spreading the word, I keep finding it out in the woods near where I set up my camp. Recently, I’ve been sleeping in the park, hoping it won’t hunt me, but I’m constantly hassled by the police. Who knows, it can probably sneak up on me even in the city. I'm afraid every door I walk through might be the beast in disguise.\n\nMy plan is to head to Belize, or maybe even farther. I don’t think I want to be in the same hemisphere as that thing. But there is a part of me that knows my parents will do anything for their little boy, and I bet the little baby is hungry again. Part of me knows I will have a final ride, I can feel it in my stump.\n\nWhatever the fuck you do, listen to me. Do not ride with the devil and stay the fuck away from UUH17. Don’t ignore this warning, because it will use the things you fear to rob you of everything you know. \n\nDon’t Ride Railcar UUH17"},"228":{"title":"I am looking to write my first ever \"Creepypasta\".

And its simply because that's what his white collar job does.\n\nBut as i said before, He's suffering a mid life crisis. His company used to be at the top with scary stuff... But nowadays? He's a depressed, washed out has been who misses the times where everyone used to fear him.\n\nThat's the basic idea for it. But i never really wrote a full story before, and i gotta say... My neurodivergency makes it very hard for me to write certain genres. I can write fantastical adventures in alternative worlds just fine, but when it's slice of life like \"Salary Man\", my brain just... Turns off.\n\nThe story also has the potential to be a huge love letter to creepypastas in general, Making fun of the genre while honoring it. It's just been a while since i last read one (I was like 12 back then), so... I wonder what Creepypastas i should research so i can get a good knowledge of the genre and its fanbase.\n\nSome inspiration for it would be nice just so i can get an idea of how i can write this thing... and if everything goes well, I'm making a comic out of \"Salary Man\".\n\n"},"229":{"title":"Frykondula (3\/?)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fpez8v\/frykondula_3\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Primajuana","selftext":"**Ray**\n\nThe remainder of the day came and went, characterized only by a very nondescript nothingness.\nI did not tell Ray about the handprints, I figured there wasn’t any point. They more than likely belonged to the man that had been looking for us and since that situation had dissipated almost entirely, I couldn’t rationalize needing to. Instead, whether as a means of recuperating from all that transpired that morning or perhaps out of habit, Ray and I resorted to the teenage lethargy we were accustomed to.\nIt wasn’t until the following day that the journal, the CD, and the late Odor would interrupt our small town stupor, presenting themselves as something needing our attention. \n\nIt was about four or so in the afternoon. At that hour the sun did not peer into Ray’s room, instead it loomed high over head warming the chill of near-winter from its blue throne. \nInside of Ray’s room, a lean figure slouched over a black video game controller, elbows on his knees, completely engrossed in whatever was happening on the TV’s screen. A plate of pizza rolls sat beside him. I stole a small handful. I sat down and leaned back in the computer chair. I propped my feet up on the arm of the couch and watched Ray mash desperately at the plastic in his hands.\n\nRay continued to distance himself from the previous extremely intense morning via button-mashing, thumbing, and whispered insults. \nI resolved to understand it, I unfolded the time ridden journal and began to study it. Much like the CD that brought me to that point, it made little sense. I remember reading some of it aloud to an unbothered and uninterested Ray,\n\n“‘Their ceremony only aids my selfishness, the last mistake that I must make.’ What do you think Odor meant by that? Who is ‘they’?”\n\nRay issued out an agitated sigh, “Look man, I have no idea. You know I’m not the one to ask about this sort of stuff.”\n\n“Maybe I should show Biggie.” I suggested at Ray who refused to be stolen from his game.\n\nRay offered, “If you wanna borrow the suburban you can. I really don’t wanna go out today, not after yesterday.”\n\nHe unclipped the carabiner attached to one of his front belt loops, the ten or so keys jangled as he prepared to toss them towards me. Opening my hands, he gently threw the ring of keys into them. \n\n“If you’re out late just bring back something from Taco Bell. I should have some cash in the little console in the middle.” Ray said without even looking over his shoulder. \n\nWith that, I left.\n\n**Biggie**\n\nI loaded up in the suburban, I drove to Biggie’s, I knocked on the door. I greeted his mother, climbed the stairs, and opened the door to his bedroom without a knock.\n\nContrary to what was the norm, the TV was not on. The afternoon sun reflected off of its convex face and onto the shag carpet. Natural light showered the room, nullifying the need for the fluorescent bulb in the center of the ceiling.\nBig E was sitting crisscrossed on the floor sifting through a large tote of legos, his back to the TV. Yuri sat across from him, a city of legos separated the two of them. The miniature cityscape took up the majority of the floor, furniture pushed aside to accommodate for its vastness.\n\n“Watch your step please.” Biggie said sounding almost bored, fixated wholly on the little pieces of plastic his fingers were rifling through.\n\n“Holy shit what is all of this?” I more or less gasped rather than asked.\n\n“Yuri started it the other day after you guys left, back when it was just a few buildings. I only joined in earlier this morning.”\n\n“Wow.”\n\nI stood in the doorway soaking in their accomplishment, baffled. They both were laser-focused. Impossibly quiet, zeroed in only on the task at hand. Still, they seemed unamused. Their eyes roving about and their hands hovering over areas of interest. All with a stoic expression on their face. \n\n“Where did Sam go?”\n\n“Oh, I asked him to leave.” E stated dryly.\n\nA little surprised at the answer, I asked, “What? Why?” \n\n“He kept tripping over the city.”\n\nYuri sat back and looked about the colorful miniature, searching for areas that needed filling out. It was obvious they had a basic road map when they started, as well as true to life color schemes for the buildings. Adding bits of detail here and there, details like window panes, street lights, fire hydrants, and doors that opened and closed. However, further and further from the center of the project, the less the little buildings lacked any sort of cohesive coloring and intricacies.\n\n“I found something of Odor’s yesterday.” I said, attempting to pull E away from the labor of his hands.\n\n“Odor?” \n\nI answered, “Yeah, the guy behind Frykondula.” \n\n“Oh really?” Biggie sounded a bit surprised. \n\n“Yeah, I found his journal. It might be connected to the CD somehow.”\n\nI carefully tiptoed around the plastic project, avoiding little piles of loose lego brick and the outer most part of the mini metropolis. I handed E the journal and he flipped through through it, marveling a bit with every turn of the page. It was the kind of thing that put a fire in his belly. Mystery. Secrets. Puzzle pieces eager to be fit together. Riddles waiting for the correct response.\n\n“How did you get this?” Biggie wondered aloud.\n\nJust as the words left his lips, a folded piece of tech buzzed to life in my pocket.\nI fished it out and flipped it open, muttering, “One second.” I exclaimed with recognition, “Oh, it’s Sam. Lemme see what he wants.”\n\nThe text read, “hai wut u doin fren :3“\n\nI typed back a response, “nuffin”\n\nI hit send, shut the phone, returned it to my pocket then lied to Biggie, “I talked to my brother about the CD. He knew what I was talking about and said that the journal was with some of his old things.”\n\nI probably shouldn’t have lied. In my defense, I wasn’t sure how Biggie would’ve responded hearing about all that had occurred at Odor’s old house just the other day. I really didn’t feel like being scolded by someone my own age, someone who likely didn’t know any better than I did. \n\n“I guess Odor left it with my brother before he went missing.” I continued the lie before clarity struck. I recalled some of the conversation I had with my brother over the phone. “He also said something about that, about Odor going missing. He thinks him and his girlfriend got lost in the woods while hiking. They were at Green Oak, I think. Y’know, that huge National park west of here?”\n\nAnother buzz, another message, it read, “cum see meh at da bleacherz i foundz da cd I toldz u abt :D”\n\nI thumbed, “okie :p”\n\nBiggie acknowledged none of what I had just said but I knew that he heard me. I knew the gears in his brain were digesting my words, the mental cogs were rotating and squishing between them this new information. \nHe continued to observe the journal with a wordless nothing. His disposition in that moment was that of an antiquarian admiring some 16th century illuminated manuscript. Silent, he studied every inch of every page\n\n“Hey, so Sam just texted me and said he wants to meet up at the bleachers. I’m gunna leave the journal with you, Ray thought you might be able to sort through some of what‘s inside.”\n\nBiggie, like Yuri, didn’t say anything. Instead, he moved his finger over some of the words as if by touching the ink he’d better understand its meaning.\n\n“Yuri.” I said to the other crisscrossed builder. “Make sure he gets back to me about the journal.” \n\nYuri nodded. \n\nI unfolded the little cellphone for a final time and typed, “on mi wey :0” \n\n**Samantha**\n\nWhen Samantha wasn’t crashing at Big E’s or tagging along with Ray and I, he was skating. When Samantha was skating and had exhausted himself from a hundred plus attempts at this or that trick, he’d retired to a set of old rusted bleachers, red and rotting in a green expanse of soccer fields.\nThe fields and metal bleachers were known only by the city’s landscapers and our little friend group. Those few acres of earth had been all but forgotten, having not been used since we’d attended grade school. Locals drove by a thousand times not once batting an eye in their direction. Making it the perfect spot for us to meet up and for Samantha to get some much needed shade.\n\nSam was sat on the dirt, crisscrossed beneath the bleacher’s shadow.\n\n“Finally, bro. Been waiting for like ever now.” He said standing and dusting himself off. \n\n“Sorry, I was at E’s.” I began. Getting a better look at him I asked, “Holy shit dude how long have you been out here?”\n\nHe was sopping wet. Watered by his own sweat, Sam’s clothes clung to him.\n\n“Oh, yeah.” He said, acknowledging his present state. “I’ve been out here pretty much all day. I was trying to nail this thing while it’s still nice out.”\n\nFriction from the grip-tape left a hole in the top of his right shoe. The butt of his jeans had two holes to match, one on each ass cheek. He had practiced the same trick and fallen and failed so much that his wardrobe was struggling to keep up. He was committed.\n\n“Anyways.” I turned my attention away from Sam’s wet body and reminded him,  “You said you find the other tape?”\n\n“Found something. Not sure if it’s from the same guy. But it’s yours if you want it.”\n\nSamantha leaned down and snatched up a drawstring bag that was rested against the metal bleacher.  He pulled out a disc protected by a paper sleeve, titled by sharpie as ‘Frykondula’s Holy Fount’.\n\n“Sweet. This should give us some answers.” I said more or less to myself whilst fetching the CD from Samantha’s fingers.\n\n“Answers?” Samantha said, suspicion in his cadence. \n\n“Yeah. I found a journal related to the first disc. Written by the guy who made all of the music. I gave it to Biggie——“\n\nSamantha cut me off with a cackle. He laughed loud, emulating a hyena sound.\n\n“Big E? Don’t tell me you’re letting Big E get to you. That’s rich. That motherfucker thinks he’s Agent Mulder.” He wiped away a nonexistent tear.\n\nShocked at the outburst and a bit embarrassed by it, I retaliated, “Dude, what the fuck is your deal?”\n\nContinuing with his thought as if he hadn’t at all heard what I just said, he followed with, “Look. Some weird guy iced some bitch. Don’t read into it. Just because he happened to make weird ass music doesn’t mean anything. I mean, tons of freaks make music.”\n\n“Where is this coming from?” I asked. “I get if you’re worried or whatever but you don’t have to be a dick about it.”\n\nSam threw his hands up and said, “I just don’t think it’s that’s big of deal, that’s all. Besides if this was as big of a deal as E would like you to believe, then wouldn’t a bunch of people have been killed or went missing or whatever the fuck? I just feel if there’s any truth behind what anyone is saying then more than just two people would be involved in this.”\n\nI retorted, “All we know is of is the one girl. There could be more.”\n\n“See!” Samantha shouted. “You even sound like him. And more what? People with no families or jobs or anyone in their life that might notice they’ve just up and vanished? Admit it, dude. E got to you.”\n\nI ignored the verbal jabs and responded, “Doesn’t mean I can’t still listen to the CD. And it doesn’t mean I can’t still look into the journal either.”\n\n“You’re insane.” Samantha pinched the bridge of his nose, mirroring a let down parent. Then asked, “Where did you even find this journal?”\n\nI repeated the same lie I told Biggie. Samantha didn’t say anything in response, only sighed.\n\nI tried to reassure him, “You’re freaking out over nothing.”\n\n“I’m freaking out over nothing? You’re over here playing detective and E is gunna convince you, if he hasn’t already, to get wrapped up in some shit you don’t wanna be wrapped up in.”\n\n“Would you chill the fuck out.” I finally snapped and bit back. “It’s probably nothing. So what? We’re reading into some art students shock project. Who fucking cares? Step off.”\n\nSamantha said nothing. He huffed, his chest stretched with air then deflated in disappointment. \n\nI continued, “We are grown. I am grown. I can take care of myself. I’m not asking you to tag along and I sure as hell am not asking for your approval.”\n\n“I know. I know.” Samantha took in a deep breath, presumably calming his nerves. “Look. Do whatever you want just be careful. Don’t go poking your head around places you shouldn’t be.”\n\n“I know you’re worried.” I placated him with an empty promise, “Look. I’ll stick to only listening to the CDs and reading the journal. Honest.” I then attempted to brush away what awkwardness our brief argument may have caused. “But you.” I poked Samantha square in the chest. “You gotta promise to quit being a dick about things.”\n\n“Whatever.” Sam said softly then playfully punched me in the arm. \n\nSam’s verbal rampages always pissed me off. This time, more than just agitate me, his outburst made me doubtful. On the way back to the suburban, Samantha’s ridicule started getting to me. Apprehension had found a crack in the mental armor and oozed its way into my mind. Had I been wrong about all of this? Was this nothing more than some fringe kid’s art project? Was their some sort of hidden narrative in the music or was it just noise? What about the girl, who was she? What happened to her? What happened to Odor?\nSubconsciously I had imagined myself finding some sort of clue about their disappearances in the journal. I envisioned my eyes growing wide as I began to put the pieces together, as I uncovered the mystery behind the lyrics and their meaning. Simply put, I wanted to know.\n\nI had to remind myself that this was Samantha. I knew him to be explosive and argumentative. I knew that Sam, in his ignorance, would try to tear down anything he didn’t care to understand with what he had already rationalized as the ‘truth’ or the ‘fact of the matter’. I couldn’t understand his negative outlook or his lack of open-mindedness. But I suppose he couldn’t understand my fascination either.\n\nBack in the suburban I long stared at the disc Samantha had just handed off to me. I tossed it onto the dashboard and headed for the Taco Bell.\n\n**The Holy Fount**\n\n“I got you two double decker tacos.” I said, shutting the door to Ray’s bedroom behind me with my foot.\n\nI set two large purple plastic cups full of soda on the TV stand then began to look through the bag of food. I ruffled about the plastic and paper for a minute before finding what I had ordered for Ray. I held it out for him, greasy and warm in my hands.\n\n“You’re a Saint.” He said, setting his controller down on the arm of the couch closest to him before taking the tacos from me. \n\nI sat in the computer chair and turned the lava lamp on, the sun would set soon and I was hoping the blobs of whatever was inside would melt and move around before it got dark. The bulb flicked on with a warmth, light shone through the red glass and splashed the hue onto the walls and the carpet.\n\nThrough a mouthful of shell and lettuce and sauce, Ray asked me, “What’d E have to say?” \n\n“Nothing really.” I said before biting into my food. “I just kinda gave him the journal and left. Saw Sam though.”\n\n“What he’d have to say?” Ray said before he squeezed his lips around a straw and took a sip.\n\n“Nothing. Just that he found this.” I held up the disc I had just received earlier.\n\n“Whoa, another one of Odor’s?”\n\n“Yup.” I said wiping off my mouth with a napkin. “I haven’t listened to it yet.”\n\nRay sorted through the laundry and magazines on the floor, tossing aside black tee after black tee until found the remote for the TV. He hit mute. \n\n“Go ahead and load that mofo up, beotch.”\n\nI shook my head and chuckled, “Right.”\n\nI wiped my hands off on my jeans and slipped the disc out of its paper sleeve. I open the tray to Ray’s stereo, put the CD in then I hit play.\n\nAt first, I thought it was some sort of joke. I thought Sam was trying to get a rise out me and the other interested parties in our friend group. The first track and several of the subsequent ones were painfully ambient. All of them were fuzzy, poorly produced, and ethereal.\nOne particular track was accented by very faint female vocalizations. The lady, whoever she was, wasn’t singing per se, just vocalizing. Her voice was put through an effect that made it sound as if she were under water. She only appeared on one track. \nAnother track was an acoustic home-brewed lullaby about staring past the brink some of shore. Another was a reading of a free-verse poem I assumed Odor wrote, accompanied by a near-silent and unnerving melody.\nAll in all, I don’t know how to describe it. The entire composition sounded like haunted electronic dinner music with an occasional sampling of rivers or rain or techno-trickling. \nThere really wasn’t any screaming. It seemed that Odor mellowed out before putting together this follow up album. That or he was just feeling far more melancholic and artsy than he did previously. \n\nAnticipating something more, we took the last bites of our dinner as quietly as we could manage. But as the record came to a close we had come to grips with our subverted expectations. Or rather, I had to.\n\nThe gelatinous somethings swam about the lava lamp, they bounced off of the glass and were swallowed into one another, I watched them swim while waiting desperately on something other what I was left with. Anything that might make it easier to understand what was going on, what Odor was getting at.\n\nFrustrated, I massaged my temples, “I don’t get it. One minute he’s screaming into the microphone about god-knows-what, next minute he’s all sappy and sad. I don’t get it.”\n\nI tried hard to understand. I knew artists and musicians were sometimes known to completely change their sound album to album. But this felt different. This was different. Odor wasn’t some renown guitar god being bitched at by label execs to make something new, something he hadn’t already done before, something that might put greenbacks in his and in their pockets. He was just a kid, cooped up in his bedroom and bleating into a whirring cassette. Odor was trying to express something, say something. It felt like he was trying to tell me directly. I knew that it had to be more than just noise, or rather newer and more diverse noises. \n\nRay interrupted my thinking. “Look, you’ve been spreading yourself thin all day.” He wiped his mouth off with a napkin and attempted to encourage me, “Yesterday morning we found the journal and today you got another CD. That’s huge, man. Let’s just coast on that high for a bit.” Ray unmuted the TV, switched off of the AV1 channel and onto TV1. Ray continued, “If you want we can listen to this new CD again sometime tomorrow. We’ll give it a thorough listen and then go from there.”\n\n“Alright. You’re right, you’re right.” I said crumbling up my taco wrappings, spent sauce packets, and napkins. I tossed the wad of trash into the empty bag, the same one that carried our food home. \n\nRay did the same, saying, “Besides, Futurama is supposed to be on later tonight and I’m not gunna miss that for anything. Especially not for Sherlock Holmes over here.”\n\nI chuckled, “Yeah, well if I was Sherlock Holmes this would be old news by now.”\n\nI let my confusion go with a heavy sigh, watching the lamp and allowing my thoughts regarding Odor and the new CD to fade into the obscured recesses of my mind."},"230":{"title":"Three videos from Colombia, England and USA.

Kali has always been a bit.. different. Never got along with the other kids, always by themself, in the corner. At recess? Alone. Slicing at the dirt with scissors. Slicing and Slicing aND SLICING. \n     Until she hurt herself. But she didn't cry. She looked at the blood in awe, finally experiencing something other than loneliness: pain. But it didn’t hurt. Instead, Kali fell in love with the feeling. Pain was something NEW, something romantic to her. Yes, she absolutely loved the feeling, more than she ever loved anything else. \n    After the adults found her, and the other students, she was ridiculed. The adults sent her to a ward after it kept occuring, but they finally thought she got better after a few years. They sent her to a normal family. A normal school. A normal life. That's what everyone expected, anyway. But after she returned to school, she found her. Someone she had loved even more than the pain she felt from cutting and burning and hurting: the girl of her dreams. The prettiest girl she had ever seen. “This must be what love feels like,” she thought, and love.. hURT. Hurt more than the countless blades she's dragged across her skin, more than the burns on her arms, more than anything ever before. \n     There were people who mistreated her, but that was something she could live with. Obviously they would point out the countless scars on her face, make fun of her long sleeves for what they're hiding. But that didn't hurt. Nothing hurt like LOVE. So when they poked fun at HER? That couldn't slide. So what if they think that her dimples are anything less than adorable? No one would realize that one measly kid went missing. \n      But it got out of hand. She had gotten too obvious, bad at hiding, bad at keeping things hidden, she let them slip. Her feelings became known, and when SHE learnt how she felt? Rejection. Crushing. Distraught. REJECTION. Kali didn't understand. She was so confused. She never had felt pain like this, not even love could hurt as much as HEARTBREAK. So there was one last thing for her to do. \n     She followed HER home. Followed her up to her room. She knew her parents weren't there, as they got off work late Thursdays. This means, nO oNe HeArD hEr ScReAm. Kali never returned to school after that. No one would miss her, anyway, since she was alone. ALL alone. So she ran. Straight into the woods. And that's where she found HIM. The man in the woods. The man without any semblance of a face. He beckoned her, as if he were saying “come closer, young one.” \n     She was never found after that. They still talk about her at her old home, her old school. Refer to her as Kali Scarface, local serial killer. Just.. Be extra careful when you go to bed at night.

It was a strange house, full of hidden rooms and forgotten spaces, the kind of place that held onto secrets long after the previous owners had left. At first, we were excited by its size and old charm, but the deeper I went into renovating it, the more unsettling it became.\n\nOne day, while working on the basement, I made a discovery that changed everything. The wall near the corner looked odd—like it had been hastily sealed at some point. Curiosity got the better of me, so I grabbed a hammer and broke through the bricks. Behind them, there was something I had never expected: a pink, glowing foil attached to the wall. \n\nIt wasn’t just glowing; it emitted a faint, eerie static sound, almost like the hum of an old TV when it's on in the background. The sound was unnerving, sending a shiver down my spine. I reached out to touch it, and the sensation was immediate—like static electricity crawling across my skin, making my hair stand on end. It was so bright in the darkness, casting an unnatural light around the room. The foil seemed to pulse with energy, as if it was alive, and I felt an overwhelming urge to follow it. \n\nI traced the foil through the basement and into a small vent. The vent was too tight for me to squeeze through, so I decided to search for more of these strange foils elsewhere. \n\nA few days later, while renovating the top floor, I found another hidden spot—this time near my little sister’s room. The renovations had been going smoothly up until then, but as soon as I pried open a small door, my stomach dropped. I had uncovered a secret room that felt wrong, a room that shouldn’t exist.\n\nInside were four stone figures, each clutching onto a glowing foil like the one I had found in the basement. The figures, though small—only about 15 cm tall—were unsettling. Each one faced a different direction, holding a differently colored foil: pink, green, blue, and yellow, each glowing just as unnaturally as the first. The static noise they emitted seemed louder in this room, a low droning that made my skin tingle and my ears ring.\n\nI stared at the statues for what felt like hours, trying to make sense of it all. Fear gnawed at me. What was this? Why were these foils hidden in the walls of the house? \n\nIn a panic, I decided to pull all the foils from their places and throw them into the secret room with the statues. I didn’t know what else to do, but something about them felt wrong, like they were infecting the house with their strange energy. My sister was away on vacation, so she didn’t notice me ripping apart the walls, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was tampering with something ancient and dangerous.\n\nOnce the foils were all in one place, everything in the house changed. The air grew thick and unbearably hot. Outside, people started acting strangely—neighbors who had always been friendly were fighting, their tempers flaring with unnatural rage. The static hum of the foils never stopped, and the entire house felt oppressive, like it was alive and angry. \n\nI realized too late that I had to put the foils back where I’d found them. But the problem was, I couldn’t get them back into the vents and walls where they’d been hidden. I wasn’t small enough to reach those tight spaces. So, I did the next best thing—I hooked them up wherever I could throughout the house, stretching them across rooms and ceilings, glowing like twisted, living veins. \n\nAs soon as I finished, the house settled. The temperature dropped, the strange behavior outside stopped, and everything seemed to return to normal. The static sound faded to a dull hum, and for a while, things felt almost peaceful again. But the glowing foils remained, hanging like a curse through every room. \n\nThe light they gave off was relentless. At night, the pink, green, blue, and yellow glow cut through the darkness, and the static hum was always present. Worse still, standing too close to the foils gave off an odd feeling—a static charge that buzzed through your body, leaving you on edge. I couldn't escape their presence; they felt wrong, intrusive, and yet alive.\n\nI tried to ignore them, telling myself that maybe I was just being paranoid, that the foils weren’t really the cause of all the strange events. \n\nMonths later, after I had finished renovating the top floor of the house, I couldn’t stand it anymore. The foils had become a part of daily life, but they were maddening—always in sight, always humming, always filling the house with that static charge. I finally snapped. I ripped the foils down again, determined to free the house of their bizarre presence.\n\nAs I pulled the foils out and returned to the hidden room with the statues, my heart dropped. The statues had moved. Each one now faced me, as if they had been waiting. Their blank, stone eyes seemed to watch me, and I realized with horror that they had grown. They were taller now—almost 25 cm, their stone forms more detailed and lifelike. The static noise from the foils had grown louder, more oppressive. It was as though the house itself was reacting to my actions.\n\nPanicked, I threw the foils back into the room and slammed the door shut, hoping to make it all stop. But it didn’t. The heat returned, suffocating and unbearable. People in the area went mad, the streets boiling with rage and violence. Outside, the temperature rose to such extremes that your shoes would melt to the ground if you stood still too long. The foils, though hidden, were still exerting their influence.\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore. I searched the house frantically, uncovering even more hidden rooms—each one filled with strange writings and symbols, depicting the statues and the glowing foils. I had stumbled upon something ancient, something I wasn’t supposed to disturb.\n\nWhen I returned to the secret room with the statues, I was horrified to find them changed once again. They now stood in a circle, facing one another, and had grown another 10 cm. I could feel their energy, a burning, oppressive force that made the air around me shimmer with heat. The foils were shorter now, too short to put back where they belonged. No matter what I did, I couldn’t return them to their original places.\n\nThe heat intensified, and the static hum grew deafening, rattling my bones. I realized then that the statues had been feeding off the foils. My actions had released something terrible. In a frenzy, I tried to rip the foils apart, but they were limp and unresponsive, shrinking with every passing second.\n\nAs the temperature skyrocketed, I felt an invisible force pulling me back to the statues. I didn’t resist. I knew I couldn’t escape it. When I opened the lid again, the statues were no longer made of stone. \n\nInstead, four children—three girls and one boy—stood in their place. They were small, about 25 cm tall, glowing with the same eerie light as the foils they had once held. They smiled at me, their faces innocent yet filled with something ancient and sinister. I offered the ends of the foils to them, and they took them, absorbing the glowing material in seconds. The children began to grow, their presence filling the room with an unbearable heat. The static hum was so loud it drowned out everything else.\n\nThen, I heard sirens. The town was being evacuated. \n\nI stood there, paralyzed as the house burned with a heat that seared my skin. The children smiled, their glowing forms casting eerie light across the room, their kind faces a twisted contrast to the horror they radiated. I don’t know how I ended up outside, but when I awoke in the garden, the town was empty. Lava flowed down the streets, consuming everything. The earth had turned to fire, and I was the only one left.\n\nEverything turned black. \n\nBut even in the darkness, I could still hear that static hum—\n\n\n"},"239":{"title":"I found this offbrand KMart \"Karusel\" has collab on YooHoo &amp; Friends!

She gets very bored easily, considering she's been doing nothing but try and find a universe that has a planet full of souls. \n\nShe finds Earth on September 22nd 1980. She was astonished by the place, with Japan being her most favorite place. As she was done observing, she goes to America and finds a mother and an 11-year-old named Nicholas.\n\nNicholas went to get a Game &amp; Watch console. It was Ball, the one where you juggle balls and make sure it doesn't touch the floor. Yeah, it was that one. \n\nThe entity followed the boy home after he purchased the game. She noticed Nicholas had three more just like Ball. There was Flagman, Vermin, and Fire. \n\nAfter Nicholas went to sleep at 10pm, the entity traveled inside the game, Ball and decided it was time to take a new form. It took the vessel of the character in Game &amp; Watch: Ball. \n\nShe had a great idea to use the data from the three other consoles to create her own world. That's right, the buildings from Fire, the (ocean-like ground?) in Vermin. \n\nDespite there being a lack of other things, but it'll do. She figured when she'd kill Nicholas, she'll place him in a vessel too. \n\nThe next day, Nicholas woke up to get ready for school. As he got up to put on his uniform, he then heard, \"Oi, sunshine!\" He looked down and saw his game on.\n\n(Yes, the entity had some retro female British voice) \n\nThe alien advised Nicholas to play a little game before school. Nicholas hesitated at first, but she was so goofy yet so annoying, so he did. \n\nAfter he lost, the entity gave Nicholas a deadly seizure, causing him to collapse and die. The entity snatched his soul out of his body and brought it to the game with her. \n\nShe decided to put his soul in the vessel of the Flagman character. She felt she was gone explode for the first time ever. \n\nWhen Nicholas, who's now Flagman, woke up, and saw her. He asked what did she do and who she is. The entity told her what she is, and how she doesn't have a name yet. The creature tells him they'll have so much fun together. \n\nNicholas hesitates in anger and runs away. As he runs, he notices the buildings look just like the ones in Fire. After thirty seconds, he gets stopped by her. \n\nShe got bored after he rudely ditched her. That's when she had the idea to give herself the name, Ms. Taikutsu, which translates to Ms. Boredom.\n \nAfter a fight, the entity, now named Mrs. Taikutsu transforms into a beast that barely looked like Mr. Game &amp; Watch. Nicholas, now seen as Flagman sprints away.\n\nThis was the start of never-ending torment.\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=\n\nThings I want to add to this story. \n\n1. A part two. (And more people\/souls) \n\n2. Before being Mrs. Taikutsu, she used to have seven small creatures in order to find a place of souls. (Deadly Sins)\nThese guys would take vessels in the Game &amp; Watch to help their master.\n\n3. Less cliches. What's something that you would change in the story to make it better?\n\nAnyways, I made the designs for Mrs. Taikutsu. (First and second design) \n\nI'll make the design for Nicholas \/ Flagman soon.

Every millenial mom at some point or another has had their kid beg them to buy in-game currency for whatever's hot at the moment. And every mom's been on the receiving end of the iPad kid tantrum they throw when they don't get it. It's like a rite of passage.  \n  \nBut things have gotten dire here. My son has gotten a bit more... \"creative\" in his pursuit of money. He's stolen my credit cards and tried to log into by bank account. I gave him a cash allowance, but he used it to buy Visa gift cards he would then enter into the game. I put a stop to that. No more allowance, no more birthday money.  \n  \nThe game's called Arcadia. Android only, I suspect because the developers felt iOS was too locked down, more on that later. For the longest time I didn't even know what the game was because whenever I tried to look, he always hid his phone screen, like he was ashamed of it.  \n  \nI downloaded the game to see what he's so obsessed with. Right off the bat, there weren't just red flags, but red flashing lights and alarm bells. The first page of the EULA read \"WARNING: You will be gaslit,\" and the proceed button is grayed out until you click a checkbox saying \"My grip on reality was never that strong anyway.\" What the fuck is *that?* What IS this?! The app asks for every single permission from your phone, and doesn't boot until you allow all of them. It even encourages you to root your phone. Fuck that, I'm running it on an emulator in a virtual machine. I've been around the block once or twice. Once I gave it full access to my nonexistent phone, the developer's name appeared on screen: Sinneslöschen.  \n  \nI had suppressed the memories, but I could never forget that word. German for \"sense delete,\" apparently. When I lived in Portland, there was this urban legend about an arcade game called Polybius. Supposedly it was some secret government mind control project. I never paid it much mind. It sounded like one of my dad's ramblings. He claimed to be an MKUltra test subject. But he was always a conspiracy theorist, and had all kinds of wacky ideas about how the world works and who runs it. For a long time I didn't even think MKUltra was real, until they declassified the files. When I read them, his stories did match what they described. Of course all this happened after he passed. I could never apologize for doubting him. I wonder if trauma like his is generational. I do remember reading once that trauma rewrites your DNA.  \n  \nIn any case, I was heading up to the arcade with my girlfriends for a round of Ms. Pac-Man. When just by chance, two men in black suits were installing a Polybius cabinet. They didn't put it in line with the other games. They gave it its own special area, where it stood out like a monolith. We all knew the legend. My girlfriends dared me to give it a try. And who am I to back down from a dare?  \n  \nIt was a vector game, like Tempest. In fact it was basically a Tempest ripoff, except instead of shooting, you collect arbitrary shapes. I was disappointed at first. The game was too easy and boring. But as the game progressed, the tunnel drew me closer and closer towards a wiry figure. The closer I got, the clearer the image became of a disembodied nervous system. Its bare, piercing blue eyeballs would come to haunt me in my sleep, just before dreams, when all the colors start to swirl. Its brain decayed before my eyes, becoming infested with maggots and liquefying into a dripping black sludge. I could smell it, even now, just imagining it. The figure came to dominate the screen, obscuring the playfield. And just when I felt lost in its unyielding gaze, the killscreen ripped me from my consciousness: a sequence of red and blue flashes almost certain to induce a seizure. At least that's what happened to me, anyway.  \n  \nDespite the health scare, I was compelled to keep playing. I tore apart my house looking for quarters and wandered the streets in search of loose change. I actually pretended to be homeless once. Yeah, I'm not proud of it either. I started seeing men in black out of the corner of my eye, and they'd disappear as soon as I looked at them. I never told anyone that, I didn't want to seem crazy. My parents convinced a rehab center to take me (gaming addiction wasn't recognized as a disorder back then), and luckily, it worked. I looked into similar options for my son, but my insurance doesn't cover rehab. Even with my salary, San Francisco is a bitch. They practically charge you to breathe here.  \n  \nGoing back to Arcadia, it seemed to be nothing more than a modernized Polybius. Upon starting a new game, the following message appears on screen: \"WARNING: In this game you earn a score. This score will not be posted to a leaderboard. Do not post about your score online. Your score is between you and God.\" Absolutely batshit. Another warning: \"In this game you play as a rat. You collect molecules. Do not question this.\" Well I wasn't going to before, but *now* I am.  \n  \nAnd the microtransactions bear questioning, too. They sell lootboxes, but there's no loot. All you get is a color indicating rarity. You can also buy credits to spin a wheel for the chance to increase a number. This number has no gameplay significance, and as far as I can tell, there's no way to actually look at it. Of course, in mobile games, they always give you something on your first spin (the first hit's free), and all it said was \"The number has been increased.\" By how much? Who knows! My son really begs me for money for *this?*  \n  \nWhat was especially concerning was that after playing the game, all my targeted ads became cigarettes and alcohol, even on my real phone. Is it even legal to advertise those? I asked my son if he got those ads, and luckily, he said no. His ads were for candy and soda. Ok, so at least it's age appropriate. But aren't candy and soda addictive in their own way?  \n  \nThere were other wrinkles too. In addition to the addiction, he also developed behavioral problems. He started fights at school and lashed out at anyone who tried to take his phone away. He even tried to bite a teacher. He was never like this before Arcadia. He was always a sweet boy. He loved butterflies and rainbows even when other kids made fun of him for it. Where did that boy go? \n\nBut I shouldn't talk about it if there are no other witnesses, right? So I started talking to other parents. It turns out Arcadia is a much bigger problem than I imagined. My son isn't even the worst case. Some kid broke into his father's gun safe and pointed it at him when he tried to take his phone. Luckily, it wasn't loaded. I made a Facebook group, and over 50 people joined. We all gave each other advice and emotional support. Arcadia has many victims.  \n  \nDespite this, and despite the weirdness, I felt a strong urge to play it again. I was too antsy to wait to get home to my VM. I downloaded it again, and I was reluctant to allow all those permissions. But I already gave all my data to China when I downloaded TikTok, so what the hell. Those targeted ads must have worked too, cause I bought cigarettes for the first time since I had my son. A six-pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade, too (don't judge me), and a lotto ticket. Maybe if I win I can get my son into rehab. As I sat on the deck with my cigarette and my nightcap, chasing molecules, a warm feeling came over me. It was more than nostalgia, it wasn't the *pain* of homecoming. I *was* home.  \n  \nI came back in to the sound of my son screaming. I rushed to his room. \"I couldn't move!\" he said, \"I couldn't scream!\" Sleep paralysis. I know the feeling. It happened to me after Polybius. The arcade cabinet sat on my chest, weighing me down, and men in black surrounded my bed. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. My dad had sleep paralysis, too, right before he was abducted and injected with psychedelics. Seeing it happen to my son broke my heart. As I consoled him, I peeked at his phone. It was flashing red and blue, playing a YouTube video titled \"Arcadia Activation Sequence (10 hours).\"  \n  \nI asked the parents if they remembered Polybius. Only a few did, but their stories all matched mine. And they all saw men in black too. It's nice to know that memory is real, at least. But soon after I mentioned Polybius, the group got deleted. I'd added a few of them as friends, but they suddenly disappeared from my friends list. I guess they were cleaning up their friends lists after the group got shut down.  \n  \nI found a trademark for Sinneslöschen filed by a Michael M. Zadrozny. I contacted him, and he happened to have a Sinneslöschen business card on his desk that very moment. Strange coincidence. The only thing on it was a website, and worryingly, it was a .onion domain. They're really going to make me break out Tor for this, huh? \n  \nIt looked lika BBS from the 80s: white ASCII on a black background. The only available page was \"careers.\" Suddenly, I had an idea. I've been coding since I was a kid. Ada Lovelace and Hedy Lamarr were my childhood heroes. I never worked in games because there's more money in other fields, but the fundamentals carry over. If I went undercover, I could blow this thing wide open. Clicking the link took me to a command line, where they asked me to type my name. Upon doing so, it prints the message \"Your data has been collected. Thank you for your participation in the Arcadia Initiative.\" All I entered was my name! What data? At this point, do I even *want* to know?  \n  \nI woke up in the middle of the night. My phone was on my chest, open to the activation video. It weighed as much as an elephant. I couldn't move. Jesus Christ, not again. Not again. Not again. Not again.  \n  \nTwo men in black appeared on either side of my bed, fading into view like ghosts. They jammed a needle into my neck and injected me with god knows what. I looked down as far as my eyes would allow, and was greeted with a floor covered with writhing, shrieking rats. The bedroom door opened, and an exposed nervous system floated in. It hovered above me, brushing me with its feathery tendrils before mimicking my position. Its brain bubbled and dripped a tar-like substance onto my face. The smell. Oh my god, I'm back again. The nervous system descended, sinking into my body and becoming part of me. The bedroom became bathed in alternating flashes of red and blue lights. And then everything went black. \n\nWhen I came to, I was bound to a steel folding chair in a blinding white room. A stout, bearded elderly man sat behind an antique mahogany desk, flanked by two men in black. His inquisitive eyes lent him a grandfatherly appearance, but his crooked smile betrayed his calculating nature. \"I'm glad you could make it to our scheduled interview,\" he said. \"I wasn't sure if you'd accept our invitation. Christopher Hedgering, charmed.\" He extended his hand for a handshake. Funny guy. \"If you have any questions before we begin, I'd be glad to answer them.\" The men in black reached into their inside breast pockets. \"But do choose your words carefully.\"  \n  \nWhere do I even begin? I had no way of knowing if what I was about to say would lead to my own death. My mind went blank. I could only muster the courage to speak one word: \"Why?\"  \n  \n\"Why what?\" prodded Hedgering.\n\n\"Why do this to children?\" \n\nHe seemed surprised by my question. \"Why does any company do anything? For money, of course.\"  \n  \nI don't buy it for a second. \"So it's all business, huh? Well what about *them*?\" I nodded towards the men in black. \"What business do you have with government agents?\"  \n  \nThe men in black whipped out their pistols. Hedgering motioned for them to lower them. \"They're a private security firm. Our data is very sensitive, as I'm sure you understand.\"  \n  \n\"The data you get from turning kids into addicts?\"  \n  \n\"The term 'addiction' carries so much stigma. We prefer 'player retention.'\" He pulled a cigar from his desk drawer and snipped off the end. \"The data from the Polybius experiment served us for many decades, but we've reached the limit of that technology. Oh, by the way, the secret of Polybius is that the joystick measures the galvanic skin response, and the game intensifies whatever stimulus increases it.\" He paused to light his cigar. \"Your son's generation is the perfect test bed for our new player retention system. They *are* called 'Generation Alpha,' after all.\"  \n  \nI scoffed. \"What a sick joke. What you call player retention, I call gambling.\"  \n  \nHis smile grew in devilish condescension. \"Have you noticed how an arcade cabinet resembles a slot machine? You insert coins and move the lever for a chance at satisfaction.\" I *hadn't* noticed that, actually. It seems so obvious in retrospect. \"And video arcades didn't come from nowhere: they're the evolution of early 20th century pinball arcades. And pinball, for a long time, was considered gambling. It was actually illegal in Chicago and New York until the late 70s. So you see, gambling has been in video gaming's blood from the very start. It's written into their DNA. But while gambling is regulated by the federal government, video gaming is not, which makes it a useful gateway to more mature forms of chance-based gaming.\" He took a long drag of his cigar. \"The fact of the matter is this: there is no conspiracy. Simply put, addiction is profitable.\"  \n  \nI had no response. Has it really always been this way? The men in black untied me. Hedgering stood from his chair. \"I'll show you out. Unfortunately, we don't have any openings right now. If you're looking for a new line of work, why not franchise an animatronic pizza parlor? I hear those are popular with the kids these days. I was going to open one in the 70s, but some rat beat me to it.\"  \n  \nHedgering wrapped his arm around my shoulder and led me out of the office. Dozens of men in black lined the halls. I was paralyzed. \"What's wrong?\" asked Hedgering. \"They're only security. Don't you feel secure?\"  \n  \nEyes wide in terror, I shambled forward. The men in black shot daggers at me from behind their sunglasses. I couldn't stand to look at them. I lowered my head and kept my eyes glued to the floor. The path out the building took so many twists and turns I lost count. I was a rat in a maze, my every movement being observed. My chest tightened and my breathing shallowed. Was it a panic attack or a heart attack? Every time I stopped to soothe the pain, the men in black pushed me forward. I felt the aura of a migraine. The sharpest, most splitting headache of my life took hold of me. I grasped my hair, pulling it from the roots. All I could do was collapse.  \n  \nThe next thing I know, I'm standing on the shoulder of a highway. Thank god for Uber, am I right? Cost a fortune. Apparently I was in Sunnyvale. My son didn't even realize I was gone, that activation video kept him too busy to notice. So now that I'm home, I've been struggling to process this. The crazy thing is, Arcadia uninstalled itself from my phone and it's no longer on Google Play. It even uninstalled itself from my emulated phone. I can't believe I'm thinking this, but... That app *did* exist, right? I would ask the other parents, but they stopped responding to my texts. Were they told to do so? Or do they think I'm crazy? I need you guys to help me out.  \n  \nQuestion one: are we *sure* it's not the government? Hedgering said the men in black were private security, but they never seemed to secure anything. They were always watching from a distance, and took off when spotted. That sounds more like surveillance to me. Question two: *am* I being paranoid? Hedgering's explanation of the industry made a lot of sense, and it's simpler than any conspiracy theory (Occam's Razor, and all). But that still doesn't explain the psychological effects.  \n  \nEver since I left that building, I've been going through withdrawals. Nausea, migraines, red and blue flashes in my vision. I see men in black everywhere, unobscured and in broad daylight. But when I reach out to push them away, there's nothing there. I check every day to see if it's on Google Play. I've downloaded so many mobile games, but they're just not the same. They don't feel like home. Didn't stop me from spending all my money on them, though. If things keep going this way, I won't have to *pretend* to be homeless anymore. In its absence, I've been smoking and drinking to fill the void. I don't care about my body anymore. I haven't felt right in it since Sunnyvale. I feel like a floating nervous system with a rotting brain. I look in the mirror and see my body there, but I'm not in it. That isn't me. My sense of self has been deleted. Jesus, I think I might actually be going insane. I mean my dad had bipolar, and that can get passed down. But was that diagnosis even real? Or were they just trying to paint him as crazy so no one would believe him? Am I losing my grip on reality? Was it ever that strong to begin with? I *need* you to tell me if I'm making sense. I *need* you to tell me I'm not being gaslitthugjhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjnb \n  \n[END OF DOCUMENT] \n \n[SUPPRESIVE APPREHENDED]  \n  \n[STATUS: DECEASED] \n \n[CAUSE: NATURAL CAUSES] \n \n[RESTING PLACE: OTERO COUNTY, NEW MEXICO LANDFILL] \n  \n[...]  \n  \n[YOUR DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED]  \n  \n[THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE ARCADIA INITIATIVE]"},"244":{"title":"Need help finding a creepypasta I listened to a few years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fowu35\/need_help_finding_a_creepypasta_i_listened_to_a\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"No-Two-8271","selftext":"This was one of the first I ever listened to and I can't find it anywhere.

I also think the bodies were ripped to pieces)\n- the main guy crawled into either the ventilation or walls of the house and found someone in them (I think the kid of the parents and he was alive)\n- the cops went back to the house later on and ended up staying the night in the house (one in the main bedroom upstairs, one in the living room on the couch. They also might have done this a few times idr. Also a chance that this wasnt part of the story im thinking of) \n- I think this took place somewhere in like Arizona or new Mexico but I definitely don't remember\n- it wasn't really paranormal I don't think\n- I can't remember anything else but I do know for a fact that it was supposedly a true story and there was even a link to a video of the guy himself telling the story to a crowd of people or something. I don't really remember how long it was. I wanna say 40ish minutes but it might have been like 20\n\nI'm sorry I can't remember much more about but it's been driving me crazy tryna remember the story that started it all for me"},"245":{"title":"I don't think it can survive for long without wearing someone's flesh...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fojbt6\/i_dont_think_it_can_survive_for_long_without\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Exciting_Ball9852","selftext":"I slapped my alarm as quickly and quietly as I could. While holding my hand over the alarm I  slowly turned to see if I had woken my wife. Jane always managed to look pretty, even when she was sleeping, well not really but, she looked pretty to me. I walked to the bedroom door on my way to the kitchen making sure to avoid the creaky aged planks that made up my bedroom floor. I could practically step around them with my eyes closed. Jane has always loved the taste of fresh game, I could never understand what she liked about it but, I loved hunting so it was a nice balance. I tried preparing the pots and plates as quietly as I could but, you know… they’re pots and plates. I told myself she couldn’t hear anything I was doing and the surprise wouldn’t be ruined but, I’m certain I heard her trying to race back up the stairs quietly to spare my feelings.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the kitchen ready for the meal I would prepare later I grabbed my beautiful bolt action CZ rifle and left out the front door. The outside world greeted me with a single tone that mirrored itself as far east as west. The blinding white frost of the cold winter morning created the illusion of distance at infinity while simultaneously appearing completely flat and right in your face. A gentle breeze made sure my eyes never opened further than a squint. I whistled at my lazy mutt and he poked his head out of his luxurious dog house. I lowered my fist to Bartleby and he used my knuckles to give himself a nice shiatsu head massage. I tucked my hand back into my pockets after the cold strips what little heat I had left. Bartleby bites at my hand annoyed that I put it away. I led him to the passenger side of my truck, opened the door for him and he hopped in closing the door behind him with his jaws on the rag I wrapped around the handle on the inside. I walked over to the driver's side and just before I ducked into the seat I looked up to see her smiling at me from the 2nd-floor window. When I saw her she flinched away but quickly came back when she realized I had already seen her. She gives me a bashful smile and wave and I shake my head chuckling while waving back at her. I start the truck and regret not getting the heater fixed, even on high it’s only barely enough to allow me one hand on the wheel while I warm up the other. At Least she’s a reliable rig.\n\n\n\nWe cut through the fresh snow with ease on the main road heading towards a nice hunting spot that I frequently visit. Bartleby had already buried himself in his smelly blanket and refused to come out. I pat him over the blanket, “Come on boy, haven’t you slept enough?” He stubbornly gives me a soft “woof”. I reach into the glove box and pull out a package of dried venison. I lay a piece next to his snout and he briefly pokes his nose out to sniff and lick up the treat. I rub his head and continue down the road until I reach my right turn. After arriving, Bartleby and I left the truck and headed towards the treeline. Bartleby immediately finds a tree to mark his territory at, and as I wait for him I begin to load up my rifle one round at a time. The forest is oddly quiet until I hear faint footsteps in the distance, I squint my eyes to try and see what’s causing the noise and I see something coming towards us from in the woods. I used my scope to get a better look at the animal and saw that it was a wolf sprinting in my direction, “huh”. I looked further up and saw an enormous pack of snarling wolves following closely behind the first. My eyes widened as an electric wave of shock sprang from my heart to all of my fingers, despite the biting cold I broke out into a sweat. I hadn’t even realized I dropped my bullets. After they lightly landed on the ground, I had already turned around to run for the truck, stopping when I didn’t see Bartleby following. I must have stopped too quickly because my feet easily lost the ground and I found it with my hands and nearly my face.\n\n\n\n I got up as quickly as possible ignoring my stinging hands, I ran back to Bartleby with the stampede of menacing black fur and white hungry teeth in the background growing in size with each passing moment. You don’t realize how large a wolf really is until you see one with your own eyes. As soon as I could reach him, I grabbed his collar and yanked. He got the message and began following. We weren’t far from the truck but the wolves also weren’t far from us. Their paws were dreadfully audible now and as I ran I couldn’t tell if the panting directly behind me was my own dog or a wild wolf. I must have been panicking too much because after I reached the truck I ended up on my ass again. “DAMN IT!” I exclaimed as I missed the handle by mere inches. I looked up and it was too late, there was no time to make it back in the truck, Bartleby stood over me like a lion. He braced for the gnashing jaws of fierce wolves but the impact never hit. The wolves ran over Bartleby and I as if we weren’t even there. They completely ignored us and continued running as a pack as if they were caught up in a blazing forest fire and had made a temporary alliance with all life in the forest to just escape. I watched them cross the main road I had turned on, their large frames shrunk to nothing in the vast empty canvas that blurred the lines between heaven and earth. The only discernible point of reference was the sun, faded behind clouds with no depth or shadow. I sat there in silence for a moment trying to calm my breath.\n\n\n\nMaybe the trees absorbed the wind, maybe the snow muted the ambiance but, after the storm of wolves passed by, the silence of the forest was unnerving. Still sitting on the ground, I laughed to myself in terror as Bartleby licked my face trying to comfort me. I gave him my knuckles and he scratched his head with them. Returning to where I dropped the bullets, I noticed that the divide between the forest and the rest of the world suddenly seemed greater. I stood before the border of two worlds and I willingly stepped into one where I didn't belong.\n\n\n\nWalking through the forest I looked up directly at the sun and felt no pain due to the clouds evenly distributing its light everywhere. Still morning, nearing noon. Bartleby found a scent and I followed him, eventually the scent became a small trail of blood. That wasn’t too unusual but, what I saw in the distance was. I jogged ahead of Bartleby because he was still just focused on the trail in front of him. I saw something in the trees. My gaze grew more intense with every step, as a clearer picture revealed itself to be another wolf hanging upright on a tree branch with its innards on display like some sick mad scientist dissection experiment. Its skin was stretched out and pinned to the tree branches as if someone were leaving an animal's skin out to dry in the sun. The corpse was still purging its scarlet fluids onto the massive blotch of fowl black-dyed snow below. My brow furrowed, and my face turned to a scowl of confusion and disgust, the pure white snow around the gorey scene only made the colors seem more vibrant and clear. What the hell could have done this? Bartleby backed up with his tail between his legs, I looked around some more and noticed the surrounding trees all had unrecognizable symbols roughly carved into them. I didn’t know what to make of what I was seeing, it was simply strange and disturbing to say the least.\n\n\n\nFinally, we arrived at my little tree fort, hunting shack, shelter, whatever you want to call it. I built her right onto a tall strong tree. Bartleby jumped into the box I made for him attached to a rope leading all the way up. I climbed up first using the ladder steps nailed right into the tree then I pulled the rope to bring Bartleby up with me. The shelter was a small one, standing upright in it was impossible and if I layed down on any side with my hands and feet stretched out I could easily touch each side of the walls. Only one side of the wall had an entire section of wood missing to show the view of the deeper part of the forest, the other walls could only be opened with small hinged hatches acting as windows barely large enough to fit my head. There was a large camo tarp covering the biggest segment of the open wall to keep out the cold. We sat patiently and comfortably inside, protected from the unrelenting cold, but despite the gentle howling of the wind, the forest really was oddly quiet. I hadn’t realized how clearly I could hear my blood pulsing to the beat of my heart in my head until the silence was broken by a gentle knocking just behind my head on the wooden wall where I was sitting. Immediately my veins froze over, my heart sank as my eyes grew.\n\n\n\n I tried to ease my growing heartbeat by thinking “Well it’s probably just a loose branch” I got up hunched over and looked at the hatch on the wall, I hesitated as I began to raise my hand towards the lock when another 3 knocks halted my movement. A weak voice from either a young boy or a lady said “Hello..?” from the other side of the wall. The adrenaline came back and I worried someone out there was freezing, in need of my help but no, that couldn’t be. How did they get up here, have they been here for some time, before I even arrived? Are they just hanging on the tree? No, if someone was out there in need of help, they wouldn’t be waiting outside a shelter, I would have found them in here when I came up. I looked at Bartleby and was surprised he hadn’t started barking, he stared at the wall intensely without moving. I opened my mouth to respond to whoever was on the other side but for some reason, my instincts were telling me to do as Bartleby was doing. Bartleby and I sat still feeling like my heartbeat was being too loud, my body strained from being in an awkward position for too long. It felt like any small movement would mean trouble so I ignored the static in my legs as they fell asleep from being in a crouched position for so long.\n\n\n\nThe silence was broken by the sound of frozen planks cracking under the weight of something on the roof. I hadn’t sealed the roof as well as the walls so there were slits where the planks joined. Light weakly pushed through and whoever was out there began blotting out what little rays of light made it through with their limbs. It began with one patch covered as flakes of undisturbed snow fell where pressure was being applied, then another landed as the first moved away to a new spot. Another two appeared behind the first two. Whatever was out there, was taking their time crawling on all fours. I began to question whether I had really heard a voice or if the silence of the forest had finally gotten to me. My lungs forgot how to work as I watched it continue across above us. After it reached the edge of the shelter, there was one last creak slightly more audible than the others, the shadow disappeared from the roof and briefly returned where the tarp was hiding us from the outside world. It had jumped. There was a thud on the floor below muffled by the snow, then rapid footsteps that quickly decreased in volume. I finally remembered to breathe again and made my way to the tarp. I lifted it and looked out. Bartleby joined me in my search but we only saw a small patch of upturned snow that broke the wavy frozen white ocean and footprints leading away from us.\n\n\n\n I looked around for a while longer before retreating back into the shelter, Bartleby decided to stay and watch for me. I quickly checked the hatch on the side of the wall where the knocking originated. Sticking my head out, I saw nothing unusual. I locked it again and sat back down still processing the odd occurrence. Had I really heard a voice? A few minutes later Bartleby began softly barking at me, trying to bring my attention back outside. “What do you see, boy?” I asked while making my way over to him. I squinted into the distance where he was looking and saw movement far away. By the color of the animal, I was fairly certain it was a deer. I grabbed my rifle and put my scope in the animal's direction. I saw a deer slightly hidden behind a tree. The shot wasn’t ideal but clear enough. For a moment I had forgotten about all that had happened up to this point but was quickly reminded that it wouldn’t end there. After focusing my sights on the deer I noticed it wasn’t quite standing but not laying down either. And it was lightly convulsing, and momentarily twitching, causing its limp hanging head to rock unsettlingly as if its bone was disconnected, clung together only by flesh and muscle. The deer appeared to already be damaged, maybe a wolf got to it before because part of its coat was hanging off of its body, and the fur was dyed red by its own blood.\n\n\n\nNot too long ago I had just woken up, well rested and with all my strength but, this day has worn me down emotionally. My mouth hung suspended in motion to speak but, being unable to find the right words to ask and no one was even around to hear me… No one was around to hear me. I dropped the scope and looked down at the ground in need of a break from the incomprehensible scene before me. After taking a breath I decided the deer was sick, I’d hunt it, but only to put it out of its misery. I had no intention of taking that back home with me. I fixed the scope back on the deer and almost as soon as I did, I jumped when the deer's neck suddenly snapped back in place, its head turned to aim its eye at me and it felt for a split second like we had switched roles. Fear manifested as a shiver down my spine amplifying the winter air around me. I hastily planted the crosshairs on the deer’s chest as if to desperately take back the role of “the hunter” and pulled the trigger without focusing my shot. The banging echo of the gun cracked through the forest bringing it to life only for a moment. In the blink of an eye, a black dot appeared on the deer’s chest as the bullet ripped through its body. The deer shook mildly at the bullet's impact but otherwise stood like a boulder, the wound didn’t even bleed. With no other reaction, the deer simply turned its head and ran off, or at least… it tried to run. I must have severed some sort of nerve because the deer moved like how my dog would walk when I would put shoes on his feet but, Bartleby looked cute doing that, but this deer was simply uncanny.\n\n\n\nAfter the deer was long gone, I wondered if chasing it was a good idea. I didn’t even want to touch it before but, my curiosity pushed me forward. Bartleby didn’t like the idea and whimpered as we first followed the footsteps of whatever was knocking on my shelter. I noticed that those footsteps were oddly humanoid, they were in the direction of the deer that I had shot so I studied them as we went. The walk seemed longer than it should have been, I looked up at the sun. It was just past noon now. I looked around the still forest half expecting to see more odd symbols etched into the bark, “That’d be creepy” I said out loud. Arriving where the deer had been when I shot it, I saw a gruesome scene. Despite the small hole, void of blood that the bullet had made on the deer's chest, the snow here was nearly completely melted away from the nauseating amounts of blood poured onto it. There was a pile of shredded organs on the floor, some bones littered the area and others were still attached to the muscle, there was even a skull there, all belonging to a deer I assume. Steam rose from the heap of warm deer guts and I gagged after staring far too long. Questions raced through my mind, I don’t know what it was that was pushing me to follow the deer I had shot but, whatever it was, it wasn’t common sense. I was stupidly desperate for answers to questions I should have never asked. At this point, snow began to dance down around me from the sky. I had to move quickly before losing the trail. Bartleby loyally but reluctantly followed behind as we walked for nearly an hour in a direction I don’t think I’ve ever walked before.\n\n\n\nThe footsteps were fading as the intensity of the falling snow increased. My vision was obscuring as the snow slowly became a mild blizzard. I saw a large dark spot in the ground ahead of me, after an hour of walking the ground rose upwards until it became a hill where I stood. The dark spot eventually revealed itself to be the mouth of a gaping hungry cave. I was done at that point, I didn't feel it'd be worth it, and I didn't have time to go off on a side adventure with my wife waiting at home. I was already late so I turned to leave. But, something had caught me off guard. I turned around to check if what I saw was reality. The footsteps I had been following abruptly ended. I was afraid to acknowledge I had been tricked I looked around my surroundings, and where I stood there was a tree-less patch going over and around the cave.\n\nI’ve heard of animals like foxes backtracking to avoid predators but, what kind of animal would use that to catch prey? I looked to Bartleby for answers and he was focused on the trees behind us. I turned back around and followed his gaze. The blizzard was giving the distance a white tint. Bartleby began growling and barking, my hairs stood on end at the thought of an unseen enemy.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't have seen it if it hadn't moved. A single hand with long slim fingers wrapped around a tree far away opened like a flower in bloom. The tree was thick and yet, this thing had half its hand around it. I looked upwards and saw the silhouette of a head. The blizzard blurred its features on the thing but I had seen enough. I froze, I hoped that what I was seeing was just an illusion brought on by the blur of the blizzard but I had to make sure. Those few seconds of stillness stretched into hours. I steadied the gun on my shoulder aiming at the now still figure I had to know if there was something really there. Bartleby had been whimpering and his cries increased exponentially as I aimed. Just as I fired the bullet, I felt an electric current shock my left leg. I looked down and saw Bartleby biting my leg hard, tugging at me while whimpering like I’d never heard him do before. He threw my shot off, but I caught a glimpse of the figure recoiling as a misty red cloud bursts from its shoulder. My eyes returned to the figure and it was sprinting at me on all fours, this was no illusion. I didn’t wait to find out what its face looked like undisturbed by a hazy storm. Bartleby led the way into the cave, and I followed without protest. My footsteps echo grew as I pushed further into darkness. Eventually, I found a boulder for Bartleby and me to take cover behind I turned to the entrance and saw the silhouette of the figure pause there standing on two legs. I aimed my rifle again and it ducked down, beginning to crawl again. I could no longer see it, all I saw was the bright outside world at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\n\nI sat there with Bartleby for a couple minutes just listening for any movement. The wind caused an almost whistle-like effect inside the cave making it difficult to make out which sounds were real and what was in my imagination. I decided it was best to keep the rifle in a defensive position as a shield rather than hope that I’d have time to lock on to my invisible target guided by sound alone. I thought my eyes were finally adjusting to the dark because I had convinced myself I could see hints of the cave walls around me and just barely the outline of a tall, long-limbed humanoid figure. It was just standing to my left not too far away. I don’t understand why it hadn’t attacked yet. I slowly aimed the rifle at it from my hip, I cannot stress how slowly I moved making sure my aim was flawless. My finger slowly squeezed the trigger, I braced for the recoil and a split second before, mere inches away from my left ear I heard the same weak “hello..?”  I flinched as the bullet hit my imaginary enemy, the flash gave me a brief scope of the area, there was no cave, I was surrounded by trees covered with odd symbols. My adversary had already gotten far too close to me biding its time using the wind as a cover for its incremental movement in the dark.I could hear it begin to make its move but Bartleby miraculously tackled the thing before I or it could react. A struggle began, I heard my dog snarling angrily and the same human voice that said hello except now it was howling like the souls of the damned.\n\n\n\nI began yelling, not in fear or any emotion that I could clearly describe, my voice just flowed without my permission, the monster's cries died out but Bartleby was showing no mercy, he continued barking, snapping his jaw and tearing at whatever that thing was. I’ve never heard Bartleby bark so intensely, it was as if he stopped taking breaths in between barking, and continued his assault. I continued yelling as my ears began ringing. After my lungs were empty a warm glow drew my eyes.I looked at my burning home. The flames raged on as I opened my mouth to release emotional pressure through my voice. I don’t know if I even made a noise, a ringing in my ears had begun deafening my audible reality. I was shaking even though I wasn’t cold. The heat from the fire felt like it scorched the hairs from my face. My wife grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me violently. I continued yelling in her face in a delirious state, I stared at her but I couldn’t remember what her face looked like. She guided the rifle in my hands to her chest while chanting something that I couldn’t hear. I kept the rifle fixed on her not knowing what else to do. She eventually walked away to the side of the house and got down on her knees. She began working on something on the floor but I couldn’t see what it was. The ringing in my head was unbearable. I couldn't explain any of my actions if I tried but, without hesitation I lifted the barrel of my rifle to my chin and fired a round into my head. My world flashed and I was plunged back into the dark reality of my situation, the transition shocked the air out of my lungs and I fell to my knees gasping for air.\n\n\n\nWhen I caught my breath I noticed Bartleby whimpering weakly, I stepped towards where I heard him. “Bart…? Y-you okay boy?” My voice quivered. I knelt down near his body, He whimpered softly. I lowered my fist to his head with tears in my eyes. Then I felt a fleshy furless skull, I recoiled before attempting to touch it again, I reached my hand out to confirm and again felt a fleshy body before me. I jolted up and pulled the trigger aiming at the spot where that thing was laying in front of me. All I heard were clicks, I reloaded the rifle in a panic and attempted the trigger again, there was one last whimper as the bullet struck it. I looked towards the entrance, and called out for Bartleby. “Here boy, where are you?” He responded with a strong bark and I saw his silhouette appear at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\n\nI jogged to him leaving the cave behind. Stepping outside, the world seemed darker than I remembered, way too dark. I searched for the sun where I last saw it, but it had disappeared. It was now hanging low on the other side of the sky, evening. How long was I in that cave for? Bartleby began walking ahead, I was eager to be done with this day too. “You leaving without me?” Bartleby stopped and turned his head at me, I stopped approaching him “What’s wrong Bart?” Bartleby stared at me and I noticed the wound on his coat, he wasn’t in good shape. A piece of his skin hung loosely around the belly area. “Oh, you’re hurt” I knelt down next to Bartleby and reached for him to check on his wound when he barked violently at me and growled. I sprung back up throwing my hands in the air “Whoa, heh-hey bart, it’s okay. It’s me Bart” his growl faded and he began walking back. I watched him continue for a moment, still a little shocked that he had snapped at me. Eventually I jogged to catch up to him, I watched him carefully as we walked and made sure to keep a distance behind him in silence.\n\n\n\nThe sun was about to begin its setting phase and we began our long walk back to the truck. I went into autopilot watching the trees go by, we walked passed my shelter in the tree and then the corpse of the gutted wolf until the sight of my truck in the distance returned my lucidity. My steps began to feel heavier the closer I got to my truck, my body tensed up as I put my hand on the door handle. I just stood there holding the door long enough to allow the cold metal to hold me back. “Bartleby…?” I turned to him as I spoke. I peeled my hand from the door and balled it into a fist, lowering it down to him I said “Come here boy” His eyes stared at me, he stood immobile while my fist hung in the air waiting for reception. Eventually he slowly walked towards me and licked my fist. I stood there clenching my jaw, my emotions turned to liquid and pushed against my eyes. I slowly pulled my hand back and gripped my rifle tightly. I closed my eyes forcing tears down my cheek that provided me with brief relief from the cold but quickly froze over stinging my face worse than the air ever could. I slowly lowered the barrel to that things head and immediately it zipped away at astonishing speed, I let out a breath of short-lived relief until it turned left onto the mainroad in the direction of my home.\n\n\n\nI dashed to the driver side and hopped in and drove away recklessly. I sped down the road disregarding the speed limit. With nothing else to do I tried to comprehend the horrors of this day but, that only left me feeling overwhelmed, I looked to my right at the passenger seat, the sight of flattened blankets put a pulsing pressure behind my eyes I lifted them hoping a stubborn mut would stick his nose out to greet me. My chest ached, but my body didn’t allow me to shed anymore tears, I couldn’t even moan in pain, only release bursts of pathetic gasping whimpers. Ignoring the roads I shifted off onto where the grass lay under the snow when I saw my home in the distance. I glided towards my driveway as my car shook and bounced violently and I nearly crashed had there not been a pile of snow to slow me down. I threw the door open and as I stood out in the cold of the growing dark I saw my wife standing in the bedroom window embraced in darkness. She had one hand raised waving at me, my muscles went limp and I shook as the strength of my will bled from my very being. I calmly walked up the steps of my porch and pushed opened the door that had already been left half open.\n\n\n\nIt was just as cold inside as it was out. I shut and locked the door behind me and made my way up the steps making sure to hit every creaky floorboard until I reached my bedroom door. My hands rattled violently as I revealed more of the room while pushing the door open. The thing wearing my wife’s skin waited for me to see it adjusting the stolen skin as it slid over its skull like a cheap mask. Gripping the rifle in my shaky hands I began to raise it to my chin, that’s when it jumped towards me inserting its fingers into my right side like it was warm butter. I don’t remember falling but I sat there against the wall looking at my exposed rib and heaving lung, somehow I never lost my grip on the rifle. When I looked up at the thing it had been momentarily blinded as the stolen skin shifted around its eyes in the commotion. I somehow found the strength to get up on my feet with a horrible gurgled grunt in my throat. I stumbled down the hallway to the hatch leading up to my attic, I struggled to reach it with half of my torso muscles gone. Eventually I brought the ladder down and climbed. I turned around and the thing was still desperately trying to readjust my wifes face onto its own like its existence depended on having an identity, even if it wasn’t its own. I could see its bones shift like they were each their own separate entity. I continued up and locked the hatch when I was in the attic. I stood leaning on the slanted ceiling around me with my rifle aimed at the hatch.\n\n\n\nIt banged on the hatch each strike fully intending to pulverize the barrier. When it inevitably came up I fired a round into its chest and confirmed my suspicion that a single round wouldn’t do much, especially in my limited time. I finally got a good look at this demonic being, it seemed to have given up on my wife’s face and showed what it was really made of. Its facial features writhed desperately changing shape as if it were waiting for an input, same went for the rest of its body except for the parts where the stolen flesh hadn’t fallen off. I fired again this time aiming at the water heater behind the thing, it hissed moments before the bright flash sent me against the wall. I felt the burn of heat and cold simultaneously, the blaze burned the hairs off my face and the cold behind me made them stand on end. I was weightless for the few moments I spent falling. I don’t remember hitting the ground but I woke up dazed. There was a patch of dirt unbothered by snow on the side of the house where a pretty red leafed plant was growing next to me, I was worried I had crushed part of it with my fall.\n\n\n\nThe world was blurry and seconds passed by as minutes. The world went dark as I closed my eyes, when I opened them again I heard the shrieking belows of a thousand souls both human and animal, when I looked at the source of the hellish cries I saw dozens of contorted limbs writhing as fire freed the souls trapped in the demonic vessel. Each of its heads displayed a unique skull spazzing wildly as if it had forgotten what it originally looked like when it was birthed from the rankest bowels of hell. It began to run off aimlessly into the distance as its body fought with itself unable to decide which direction to go. That was the last memory I could recall from the night I lost everything.\n\n\n\nAnd now I lay here staring at a cheap white tiled roof, hooked up to a machine. I can still feel my leg, the nurses say it's called phantom limb syndrome and that it should go away or become mostly undetectable after the first year. I hope to God that whatever that thing was, it died along with my wife and dog but, something tells me it's still out there somewhere, I’m going to have to sell my land to pay for the medical expenses, but I can’t ever truly leave until I know it's dead.\n\n"},"246":{"title":"I Just Started A New Creepy Pasta Show :)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fonij8\/i_just_started_a_new_creepy_pasta_show\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"jboormancross","selftext":"I’ve been doing youtube for around a year now and decided I wanted to mix things up with a new series.

It feels like a lifetime, but I have never been so affected by a performance before.\n\nI had waited a long time for this evening. Plácido Domingo—the legend, the voice that had captured the hearts of millions around the world—was going to perform Verdi’s *Otello*. As a child, my mom and I listened to his records, watching VHS tapes of his performances, even though the video quality was quite poor. Now I stood here, finally, in the grand opera house of the Wiener Staatsoper in Vienna, anticipation building inside me as the lights dimmed, and Plácido’s almost unreal presence filled the stage.\n\nHis performance was flawless. More than flawless. His voice was strong, commanding, and powerful, carrying us into the tragedy of *Otello*. Every note, every movement was perfect and refined. The audience sat spellbound, mesmerized by the pure magic of his art. When the final note faded and the curtain closed, there was a brief moment when the audience, struck by awe, sat in complete silence. The silence was charged with tension, the air electric. And then—applause.\n\nWe all rose to our feet, clapping in praise and admiration for the performance we had just witnessed. The applause was well-deserved—after all, Plácido was a genius. I clapped along, cheering with intensity, my heart pounding with excitement. I had never before felt so overwhelmed with emotion during a performance. The crowd was full of energy, and the sound of thousands of clapping hands at once was like an unbridled force of nature.\n\nPlácido came back on stage, bowing deeply, his face glowing with humility and pride. The applause intensified, the sound echoing off the ornate walls of the opera house. Naturally; he was, after all, a living legend. He bowed again, waved, and left the stage for the second time. But the applause continued.\n\nThe clapping had now gone on for quite a while. Three to five minutes? Anyway, it felt like it would never end. At first, I reveled in it. We were all celebrating a transcendent moment, a kind of collective worship. But soon, a strange sensation crept in. The clapping felt different now. More forced. More relentless. As if we had all agreed to keep going without knowing why.\n\nSeven minutes. A faint pressure started building at my temples. I shifted on my feet, glanced at the faces around me. Everyone was still clapping. Smiling. Enthralled. Should I stop? No one else was stopping. I scanned the room, hoping to catch someone’s eye, someone who might share my hesitation. But they were all enraptured, clapping like their lives depended on it.\n\nI checked my watch. Seventeen minutes. You don’t understand how long seventeen minutes are until you’ve clapped through every second of them. My palms had started to ache, the skin warm with friction. Each minute felt like an entire year passing, each second a weight dragging me deeper into this overwhelming experience.\n\nThe noise. It was unbearable.\n\nIt had started as a simple, rhythmic applause, a natural reaction to the performance. But now? Now it had become something else. The clapping had intensified, deafening, like a tidal wave crashing over me again and again. The sound filled every corner of the hall, overwhelming my senses. \n\nTwenty-five minutes. My ears were buzzing from the constant assault, so loud it seemed to drill into my skull. The pressure. The pain blossomed deep inside my head, spreading to my temples, distorting my brain. The lights above us burned too bright, the air grew too thick, and I swear, for just a moment, the walls began to close in.\n\nAnd then I felt it, with a sickening warmth. The wet trickle running down my neck.\n\nI raised my hands, trembling, and touched my ear. Blood.\n\nI froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The sound, the immense pounding of a thousand hands, thundered in my head. Each clap like the precise strike of a hammer, ringing and pounding with intense force. I wanted to scream, but my voice was lost in the noise.\n\nI looked around, desperate, but no one seemed to notice. Their faces were blank, their eyes glazed, their hands moving in that endless, mechanical rhythm. The room began to blur, the faces around me turning into indistinct shapes, their hands nothing more than ghostly blurs in the low light.\n\nThirty-three minutes. The clapping reached new heights. I winced as another wave of applause crashed against my head, and the ringing in my ears grew into a scream. My palms ached, my arms trembling, but I couldn’t stop. There was a weight in the air, as if being the first to stop clapping would betray the moment, a sin against the magic we had all witnessed.\n\nMy palms began to burn. At first, it was a faint warmth, like friction against the skin, but now the heat grew sharper, stinging. I looked down and saw small red lines blooming in the center of my palms, the skin raw and tender. I kept clapping. I couldn’t stop. My heart beat in time with it, each pulse reverberating in my temples, in my ears.\n\nFifty-one minutes. Plácido appeared again. A sound wave so loud I felt my bones tremble. Little pricks of pain in my skin. I looked down. The skin had split in places, my hands slick with blood. My elbows ached, they shook with each clap, the joints grinding together like rusty metal. I felt the tendons in my arms tighten like an overstretched harp string, about to snap.\n\nPlácido stood on the stage, his face shadowed by the stage lights. He bowed deeply once more, but there was something wrong with his smile. It stretched too far. It was as if he was no longer real—just another part of this nightmare we had created.\n\nThe clapping echoed even louder, a thunderous sound that felt like it would never end. The unbearable pain. The assault. But I couldn’t stop. I won’t be the first to stop and, in doing so, dishonor the great Plácido Domingo.\n\nA full hour passed. The woman next to me groaned, her eyes wide and glittering with fear. Her hands were red, slick with blood like mine. She looked at me, her lips trembling, as if she wanted to say something, anything. But she didn’t. She just kept clapping.\n\nThe ringing in my ears had become deafening. Each clap felt like an explosion inside my head. I could feel the blood running faster, soaking the collar of my shirt, the pain blinding, suffocating. It drowned all thoughts, reason, and logic.\n\nSixty-four minutes. Would this ever end? Could it end?\n\nPlácido bowed again.\n\nAnd I kept clapping.\n\n"},"249":{"title":"What's Worse than an Exorcism? ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fofyjq\/whats_worse_than_an_exorcism\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"iifinch","selftext":"It was 2 AM in the morning, and I was either about to ruin my friend group or start something new and strange.\n\nExhausted but unwilling to go to sleep, I pushed off my blanket to only cover my legs and sat up on the couch I laid in. Less than two feet apart from me was the owner of the apartment I was in, a girl I was starting to have feelings for.\n\nI was either getting love or sex. Sex would be a natural consequence of lowered inhibitions, the chill of her apartment that these thin blankets couldn't dampen, and the fact we found ourselves closer and closer on her couch. The frills of our blankets touched like fingers.\n\nLove would be a natural consequence of our common interests, our budding friendship—for the last three weeks, I had texted her nearly every hour of every day, smiling the whole time—and most importantly, our little game we'd been playing since I got here. Who's the bigger freak? Who can say the most crude and wild thing imaginable? It started off as jokes. She told me A. I told her B. And we kept it going, seeing who could weird out the other.\n\nThen we moved to truths and then to secrets, and is there really any greater love than that, to share secrets? To expose your greatest mistakes to someone else, and ask for them to accept you anyway.\n\nI didn't quite know how I felt about her yet in a romantic sense. She was a friend of a friend. I was told by my friend to not try to date her because she wasn’t my type and it would just end in heartbreak and might destroy the friend group. The funny thing is I know she was told the same. \n\nMabel- the girl who laid beside me- texted me casually earlier that day. She mentioned she didn't know what movie to watch. I knew what movie I wanted to watch. I'd pick and pay for the movie, she'd host and cook. Now, here we were about to start love or sex. It's never both this early.\n\n\"That was probably my worst relationship,\" she said, pulling the covers close to her. \"Honestly, I think he was a bit of a porn addict too.\" Her face glowed. \"What's the nastiest thing you've watched?\"\n\nI bit my lip,  gritted my teeth, and strained in the light of the TV. Our game was unspoken, but the rules were obvious—you can't just back down from a question like that.\n\nI said my sin to her and then asked, \"What's yours?\"\n\nShe groaned at mine and then made two genuinely funny jokes at my expense.\n\n\"Nah, nah, nah,\" I said between laughs. \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"No judgments?\" she asked.\n\n\"No judgments,\" I said.\n\n\"And you won't tell the others?\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\"Pinky promise,\" she said and leaned in close. I liked her smile. It was a little big, a little malicious. I liked that. I leaned forward and our pinkies interlocked. My heart raced. Love or sex fast approaching.\n\nShe said what it was. Sorry to leave you in the dark, reader, but the story's best details are yet to come.\n\nShe was so amazed at her confession. She said, \"Jesus Christ\" after it.\n\n\"Yeah, you need him,\" I joked back. Her face went dark.\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" she asked.\n\n\"What? Just a joke.\"\n\n\"No, it's not. I can see it in your eyes you're judging me.\" She pulled away from me. The chill of her room felt stronger than before. And my chances at sex or love moved away with her.\n\n\"Dude, no,\" I said. \"You made jokes about me and I made one about you.\"\n\nShe eyed me softer then, but her eyes still held a skeptical squint.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said, \"I just know you're religious so I thought you were going to try to get me to go to church or something.\"\n\n\"Uh, no, not really.\" Good ol' guilt settled in because her 'salvation' was not my priority. I am Christian, just not good at it. I'm not too shabby at the love-everyone part though, so that's half the battle. Well, at least I was good at loving your neighbor, but we'll get there.\n\n\"Oh,\" she slid beside me again. Face soft, her constant grin back on. \"I just had some friends really try to force church on me and I didn't like that. I won't step foot in a church.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry to hear that.\"\n\n\"There's one in particular I hate. Calgary.\"\n\n\"Oh, uh, why?\" I froze. I hope I didn't show it in my face, but I was scared as hell she knew my secret. I just took a job at Calgary.\n\n\"They just suck,\" she said, noncommittal.\n\nDid she know?\n\n\"What makes them suck?\"\n\nShe took a deep breath and told me her story—\n\nAt ten years old, I wanted to kill myself. I had made a makeshift noose in my closet. I poured out my crate of DVDs on the floor and brought the crate into the closet so I could stand on it. I flipped the crate upside down so it rested just below the noose. I stepped up and grabbed the rope. I was numb until that moment. My mom left, my family hated me, and I feared my dad was going insane. The holes in the wall, welts in his own skin, and a plethora of reptiles he let roam around our house were proof.\n\nAnd it was so hot. He kept it as hot as hell in that house. My face was drenched as I stepped up the crate to hang myself. I hoped heaven would be cold.\n\nHeaven. That's what made me stop. I would be in heaven and my Dad would be here. I didn’t want to go anywhere without my Dad, even heaven.\n\n Tears gushed from my face and mixed with my salty skin to make this weird taste. I don't know why I just remember that.\n\nAnyway, I lept off the crate and ran to my dad.\n\nI ran from the closet and into the muggy house. A little girl who needed a hug from her dad more than anything in the world. It was just him and me after all.\n\nReptile terrariums littered the house; my dad kept buying them. We didn't even have enough places to put them anymore. I leaped over a habitat of geckos and ran around the home of bearded dragons. It was stupid. I hated the feeling that I was always surrounded by something inhuman crawling around. It hurt that I felt like my dad cared about them more than me. But I didn't care about any of that; I needed my dad.\n\nI pushed through the door of his room, but his bed was vacated, so that meant he was probably in his tub, but I knew getting clean was the last thing on his mind.\n\nI carried the rope with me, still in the shape of a noose. I wanted him to see, to see what almost happened.\n\nI crashed inside.\n\n\"Mabel, stop!\" he said when I took half a step in. \"I don't want you to step on Leviathan.\" Leviathan was his python. My eyes trailed from the yellow tail in front of me to the body that coiled around my dad. Leviathan clothed my dad. It wrapped itself around his groin, waist, arms, and neck.\n\nAnd it was a tight hold. I had seen my father walk and even run with Leviathan on him. Today, he just sat in the tub, watching it or watching himself. I'm unsure; his mental illness confused me as a child, so I never really knew what he was doing.\n\nI was the one who almost made the great permanent decision that night, but my dad looked worse than me. His veins showed and he appeared strained as if in a state of permanent uncomfortably, he sweat as much as I did, and I think he was having trouble breathing. The steam that formed in the room made it seem like a sauna.\n\nHe was torturing himself, all for Leviathan's sake.\n\n\"Dad, I—\"\n\n\"Close the door!\" My dad barked, between taking a large, uncomfortable breath. \"You'll make it cold for Leviathan.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" I did as he commanded and shut the door. Then I ran to him.\n\n\"Stop,\" he raised his hand to me, motioning for me to be still. He looked at Leviathan, not me. It was like they communed with one another.\n\nI was homeschooled so there wasn't anyone to talk to about it, but it's such a hard thing to be afraid of your parents and be afraid for your parents and to need them more than anything.\n\n\"Come in, honey,\" he said after his mental deliberation with the snake.\n\nAnd I did, feeling an odd shame and relief. I raised the noose up and I couldn't find the right words to express how I felt.\n\nI settled on, \"I think I need help.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" my dad said and rose from the tub. So quick, so intense. For a heartbeat, I was so scared I almost ran away. Then I saw the tears in his eyes and saw he was more like my dad than he had been in a long time.\n\nHe hugged me and everything was okay. It was okay. I was sad all the time, but it was going to be okay. The house was infested, a sauna, and a mess, but life is okay with love, y'know?\n\nHe cried and I cried, but snakes can't cry so Leviathan rested on his shoulder.\n\nAfter an extended hug, he took Leviathan off and said he needed to make a call. When he came back, he told me to get in the car with him. I obeyed as I was taught to.\n\nWe rode in his rickety pickup truck in the dead of night in complete silence until he broke it.\n\n\"I was bad, Mabel Baby,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"As a kid, I wasn't right,\" he said. My father randomly twitched. Like someone overdosing on drugs if you've seen that.\n\nHe flew out of his lane. I grabbed the handle for stability. The oncoming semi approached, honked at us. I braced for impact. He whipped the car back over. His cold coffee cup fell and spilled in my seat. My head banged against the window.\n\nIt hurt and I was confused. *What was happening?* The world looked funny. My eyes teared up again, making the night a foggy mess.\n\n\"I wasn't good as a child, Mabel Baby. I was different from the others. I saw things, I felt things differently. Probably like you.\"\n\nHe turned to me and extended his hand. I flinched under it, but he merely rubbed my forehead.\n\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" he said, hands on the wheel again, still twitching, still flinching. \"You know you're the most precious thing in the world to me, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. Um, we're going fast. You don't want to get pulled over, right?\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't stop for them. No, Mabel Baby, because your soul's on the line. I won't let you end up like me.\"\n\nThere was no music on; he only allowed a specific type of Christian music anyway, weird chants that even scared my traditionally Catholic friends. The horns of other drivers he almost crashed into were the only noise.\n\n\"What do you mean, Daddy?\"\n\n\"I was a bad kid.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I was off to myself, anti-social, sensitive, cried a lot, and I wasn't afraid of the dark, Mabel Baby. I'd dig in the dark if I had to.\"\n\nHis body convulsed at this, his wrist twisted and the car whipped going in and out of our double yellow-lined lane.\n\nI screamed.\n\nIn, out, in, out, in, out. Life-threatening zigzags. Then he adjusted as if nothing happened.\n\n\"Daddy, I don't think you were evil. I think you were just different.\"\n\nThis cheered him up.\n\n\"Yes, some differences are good,\" he said. \"We're all children under God's rainbow.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I said. \"We're both just different. We're not bad.\"\n\n\"Then why were we treated badly? We were children of God, but we were supposed to be loved.\"\n\n\"We love each other.\"\n\n\"That's not enough, Mabel Baby. The good people have to love us.\"\n\n\"But if they're mean, how good can they be?\"\n\n\"Good as God. They're closer to him than us, so we have to do what they say.\"\n\n\"But, Daddy, I don't think you're bad. I don't think I'm bad. I think we should just go home.\"\n\n\"No, we're already here. They have to change you, Mabel Baby. You're not meant to be this way. You'll come out good in a minute.\"\n\nWe parked. I didn't even notice we had arrived anywhere. I locked my door. We were at a church parking lot. The headlights of perhaps three other cars were the only lights. He unlocked my door. I locked it back. Shadowy figures approached our car.\n\n\"It's okay, honey. I did this when I was a kid. They're going to do the same thing to me that they did to you.\"\n\nBANG\n\nBANG\n\nBANG\n\nSomeone barged against the door.\n\n\"They made me better, honey. The same thing they're going to do to you.\"\n\nMy dad unlocked the door. Someone pulled it open before I could close it back. I screamed. This someone unbuckled my seatbelt and dragged me out. I still have the scars all up my elbow to my hand.\n\nScreaming didn't stop him, crying didn't stop him, my trail of blood didn't stop him.\n\nTHE END OF HER STORY\n\n\"And that's it. That's all I remember,\" she said and shrugged.\n\n\"Wait. What? There's no way that's all.\"\n\n\"Yep. Sorry. Well...\"\n\n\"No, dude, tell me what happened. What did they do to your dad? Does it have to do with the reptiles? What did they do to you?\"\n\n\"I just remember walking through a dark hallway into a room with candles lit up everywhere and people in a circle. I think they were all pastors in Calgary. They tried to perform an exorcism. Then it goes blank. Sorry.\"\n\n\"No, that's not among the criteria for performing an exorcism.\"\n\n\"Excuse me? Are you saying I'm lying?\" she said with a well-deserved attitude in her voice because I might have been yelling at her.\n\nI wasn’t mad at her to be clear. I was passionate. I was a Pastoral intern because I saw the good the church can do. I wanted people to get the same feeling of love and hope I got from church that I got. And more than anything I hated when the church let down those it was supposed to protect.\n\n\"No,” still not calm. “I'm just saying a child considering suicide isn't in the criteria to perform an exorcism.\"\n\n\"Oh, maybe it's different for Calgary.\"\n\n\"No, I know it's not.\"\n\n\"And how do you know that?\"\n\n\"No, wait, you need to tell me what really happened.\"\n\n\"Need?\"\n\n\"Yeah, need. It's not just about you; this is important.\" I know I misspoke but for me it was a need. I could fix this. If I played my internship right I could take over Calgary in a couple of years I had to know its secrets. I could put an end to it.\n\n\"It's never about me is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, this certainly just isn't—\"\n\n\"It's always about you because you're good, you're Christian and you're going to make this world better or something.\"\n\n\"What? No, c'mon, where is this coming from?\"\n\n\"It's always okay because you're Christian.\"\n\n\"That's not fair. I just want to know what happened because it wasn't an exorcism. What happened?\"\n\n\"It's getting late. I think I want you to leave.\"\n\n\"Hey, no, wait. I'm doing the right thing here. Let me help you...\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not want or need your help you think you're better than me and could somehow fix it because you're Christian.\"\n\n\"No, I think I could fix it because I have the keys to the church.\"\n\n\"Oh...\" she was stunned and I saw a mischievous grin form on her face again. “Well,” she swallowed hard and took a deep breath. “They took something from me, something that's still down there. And I'm not being metaphorical; I can feel it missing.”\n\n\"If you lost something, let's go get it back.\"\n\nThere was another possibility I hadn't thought of between sex or love that I could have tonight: adventure."},"250":{"title":"The Chilling Mystery of Overtoun Bridge","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1foi1jc\/the_chilling_mystery_of_overtoun_bridge\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the eerie tales of Overtoun Bridge, where dogs leap into the unknown.

I can’t ever shake it. It sits at the bottom of every insane thing I’ve ever done. I know what medical professionals would call it, were I ever to have voiced it to one of them. Delusion. They’ve said that of thoughts far less crazy than this, this toxic memory. \n\r\nI’m nineteen. It’s late august, early September. The last day of my summer internship. I’m getting my final timesheet signed. The guy signing it is not who normally signs them, it’s time to leave and pretty much everyone has already gone. He asks me if I have any thoughts on the experiment we’re running. I ask if the giant laser is really necessary, and he laughs and says something like, how else would you heat it. I respond eddy current heating. It’s just as fast, and far simpler so probably far more efficient. Then the conversation strays to the depleted uranium in the capsules. I suggest fission may not need neutron collisions, just activation energy.\n\r\nAt that point, he reaches on his pocket for his keys. A car alarm on the other side of his office window goes off. He fakes a curse, turns off the alarm and continues the conversation. Trying to convince me what I’m saying won’t work. I’m 19, have only taken one year of college, and his job title suggested he had a PhD or something. I took him at face value. Fifteen years later, I’m not convinced. I’ve done the math myself now. Rough, off the cuff calculations, but I have found the idea to be extremely feasible.\n\r\nBut that’s not what makes this weird, or a delusion. That isn’t what haunts me. That isn’t what condemned me to a life spent crying alone in a padded room.\n\r\nThe delusion is what happens next.\n\r\n3 Corporate security officers enter the room, guns drawn, but aimed at the floor. The guy tells them they need to question me. Then he takes his stuff and leaves. \n\r\nAnd then they draw syringe and ask me my alcohol tolerance. I say I’m a lightweight. One laughs and suggests that I’m lying. And then another one injects me. I ask what it is, they laugh and say “sodium pentathol. The truth serum.”\n\r\nI laugh and say they’re joking, but don’t resist as they inject me. One of them has me at gunpoint, and I, I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. Just asked questions. Tried to help. But it seems, nineteen-year-old interns aren’t supposed to know certain things. \r\nAnd then, in a few seconds, I was drunk. Not just drunk, completely shitfaced. My memory is patchy. I don’t remember what they asked. I don’t remember what I said. I just remember flashes. \n\r\nFlashes of me bent over with no pants. Flashes of a computer monitor playing the darkest pornography imaginable, reflections in ice water flickering in the monitor light, and then another, longer moment. Burned into my mind forever. A pure existential horror that no amount of alcohol or pentathol or whatever that was could override. They were on my public Facebook profile. They were scrolling down my friends list. Making plans to rape my female friends and family members. Talking about how they’d make a lot of money off some of them. Telling me they’re with the CIA. And if I ever told anyone they’d destroy me and everyone I loved.\n\r\nAnd then I was home. Parked on the street by my front yard. Sitting in my passenger seat. My parents aren’t home from work yet. We were flying to Hawaii for vacation the next day. They were working late, again, to have enough work done to be able to relax while we were gone. At my feet is an empty fifth of Jack Daniel’s that I don’ t remember buying or drinking, what I do remember, is so horrible, it feels like a dream, it can’t be real, it can’t be true. I decide to forget it, and never go back. A week later I was at school. In another world, and the whole experience, was easily forgotten. \n\r\nExcept it wasn’t. \n\r\nA year and a half later, I had a public speaking project in my engineering ethics class. I didn’t know what to talk about. My girlfriend suggested I talk about my internship. A reasonable suggestion, I suppose, except it caused me to remember. I didn’t talk about my internship. Instead, I talked about something I found on the company’s website from an entirely different department. \n\r\nBut the memory, oh god the memory, it came back. Horrifying, bizarre, unbelievable. And to make matters worse, my girlfriend was cheating on me. Had been since day one. The relationship was falling apart. I could pretend I didn’t know for only so long. I could pretend I didn’t care for only so long. She couldn’t keep it a secret, and she couldn’t help but feel hurt that I seemed not to care. \n\r\nAs the relationship fell apart, I turned to porn. And then I found them. In the millions of pornstars out there, there were bound to be a few doppelgängers. \n\r\nAnd when you have a horrifying memory telling you something horrifically evil is planning to traffic everyone you’ve ever met, once you find one, you can’t help but hunt for them all. It is said that, Seek and ye shall find. And I found. Some real, most imagined, but so close. So horrifyingly close. \n\r\nI lost my mind. \n\r\nI went completely batshit insane. Spent nearly a year in mental hospitals being called schizophrenic and drugged with every mind and soul crushing sedative they could put into me.\r\nJust like my rapists wanted me to.\n\r\nIt took me fifteen years of therapy to figure out that the bit at the end, where they picked through my Facebook was all for show. They weren’t looking for other targets. I was their target. \n\r\nAnd now the only question left in my mind is, did they do it because they’re a pack of terrible lone wolves, or did they do it because the policy of nuclear non-proliferation meant I was too dangerous to be left waking around? Because my questions were the cusp of something incredible. \n\r\nNuclear fusion. The ultimate energy source. Achieved with a net energy game by using tiny thermonuclear bombs, detonated by using eddy current heating to start fission in uranium and implode micrograms of tritium and deuterium, in fusion blasts do small they could be contained and harnessed.\n\r\nIt could solve all the world’s problems (technology wise), but at the same time, it would proliferate nuclear weapons worldwide. \r\nI struggled with the ethics of my present dilemma for a long time, but from my angle, the angle of someone who was raped to keep a secret, the ethics become a bit easier. \r\nThe world must know. Because when rape becomes a matter of procedure, the darkest of dystopias is realized. \n\r\nA field comparable to that of an MRI machine, shut off instantly using vacuum interrupters, would produce a changing magnetic field strong enough to heat a few milligrams of depleted uranium to 15MeV, the energy required for fission.

It's called spelunking, and it involves gearing up and crawling into cave systems for fun. We got together and planned another trip to a new cave near our city, but we didn't know this trip would leave us as spooked as it did.  \n  \nBefore this trip, we had explored caves countless times. We loved that sense of accomplishment in discovering new parts of the underworld that no one else had seen. On a caving forum, we heard about a new cave nearby, one that didn’t require ropes or harnesses, and we couldn’t resist the urge to go explore it.  \n  \nWe spent the night before preparing. We checked our equipment, boots, waterproof jackets, helmets, and extra flashlights. We studied the weather reports, ensuring there was no chance of flooding. Everything seemed good, so we loaded it all into the car and decided to head out early in the morning to the new cave.  \n  \nThe entrance of the cave was smaller, a tight restriction that you had to wiggle into. We fought our way inside, which then opened up into a small room, the cool air wrapping around us. Cave systems are always cold, which is why you need to pack a jacket and proper gear to prevent hypothermia. We navigated through narrow passages, often contorting our bodies to fit through tight spots. At one particularly constricted section, we had to lie flat on our stomachs to crawl through, the rock scraping against our arms and sides.  \n  \nIt was at this point that something caught our attention. In the damp mud below, we saw paw prints that led deeper into the cave. Jake shrugged it off, suggesting it was probably a possum or some other small creature. I nodded, a little unease creeping in, but I pushed it aside. We were seasoned cavers; we had encountered wildlife before, but often it wasn't this deep into the cave. Besides, there is often no light or food in these caves, and the prints were too big to be from a bat or rat.  \n  \nAfter crawling through the restriction, we emerged into a larger chamber, the ceiling rising about seven feet high. It felt like a small bedroom carved from stone. We took a moment to breathe, the air thick and musty. That was when we heard it—a soft scurrying noise from the other side of the room.  \n  \nWe slowly moved toward the sounds, our flashlights cutting through the darkness. The light illuminated the damp walls, with stalactites dripping water onto the cave floor. Tracing the walls more with the light revealed two paths branching off from the chamber: one sloping sharply downward and the other resembling a standard passage. I hesitated, and so did Jake. We both shone our lights down the visible passage but saw nothing. Then we crept closer to the steeper passage and shone our lights down into the crevice.  \n  \nAt first, there was nothing but shadows, but then... there it was. A creature, hunched and dark, with glowing eyes peering at us from around the corner. It must have been 2 to 3 feet tall, so much larger than any typical cave animal we've seen before. It was panting heavily. My heart raced as I shouted out my favorite obscenity. I guess I shouted loud enough because whatever that thing was quickly ran off behind the corner of the tunnel, out of our sight.  \n  \nI looked at Jake and asked what the hell that thing was. He had no clue. He mentioned that maybe it was a bobcat or some other type of mountain lion. We were deep in the Smoky Mountains, which are known for these types of animals.  \n  \nPanic surged over both of us. We didn’t wait another moment. We quickly gathered our gear, adrenaline propelling us back toward the entrance. The darkness behind us was unnerving. At any moment, that thing could be crawling up toward us, so we moved quickly, crawling back through the narrow passages, our flashlights flickering as we maneuvered around the corners of the tunnels we had entered.  \n  \nFinally, we reached the cave’s mouth, the daylight illuminating the walls and giving us some relief. When we got out, we decided to just call it a trip and head back home to wash off and get some food. We took a little break from caving after that event, but eventually, we both concluded it was some type of larger animal that must have taken shelter in the cave. It was a scary encounter nonetheless."},"254":{"title":" A Reflection, you can’t escape","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fo79c0\/a_reflection_you_cant_escape\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Upstairs_Pay_8698","selftext":"The Watcher in the Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric and his wife Lisa had always dreamed of living in the countryside, away from the noise and chaos of the city. So, when they found a charming old farmhouse nestled on a quiet road surrounded by woods, it seemed perfect. The house was beautiful, if a bit worn, with large windows that overlooked a serene field. It was everything they had hoped for.\n\n\n\n\nThe first few weeks were peaceful. They spent their days fixing up the house, enjoying the fresh air, and getting to know their new, quiet life. But as the days grew shorter and the nights darker, Eric began to notice something odd.\n\n\n\nEvery evening, just after sunset, he’d feel a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, as though he were being watched. At first, he dismissed it as paranoia—just getting used to the isolation. But the feeling persisted. Whenever he looked out of the large windows facing the field, he felt certain that something—someone—was standing there, just beyond the edge of the woods.\n\n\n\nOne night, unable to shake the sensation, Eric stood by the window, staring into the dark expanse of the field. The moon was full, casting long shadows across the grass. For a long time, there was nothing. But just as he was about to turn away, he saw it—a figure, standing far out in the field, motionless. It was too distant to make out clearly, but it was tall and human-like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Lisa,” he called, his voice uneasy. “Come look at this.”\n\n\n\nLisa came to the window, squinting into the distance. “I don’t see anything, Eric. Are you sure?”\n\n\n\nEric blinked, and the figure was gone. The field was empty. He tried to laugh it off, convincing himself it was just a trick of the light, but the uneasy feeling lingered.\n\n\n\nOver the next few nights, the figure returned. It would appear at dusk, standing a little closer each time, always watching. Eric began dreading sunset, unable to shake the feeling that the figure was coming for them. He stopped mentioning it to Lisa, not wanting to scare her, but the lack of sleep and constant anxiety were wearing on him.\n\n\n\nOne evening, as they were having dinner, Lisa glanced out the window and froze, her fork halfway to her mouth.\n\n\n\n“Eric…” she whispered. “There’s someone out there.”\n\n\n\nHe looked up, his stomach dropping. The figure was closer now, standing just at the edge of the yard, barely visible in the fading light. It was tall, impossibly tall, with elongated limbs and a featureless face, just a dark shape staring at them.\n\n\n\nThey both ran to the door, but when they flung it open, the yard was empty. No footprints in the soft ground, no rustling in the trees. Nothing.\n\n\n\nThe next night, the figure was even closer, standing just outside the window, its long fingers nearly brushing the glass. Eric felt a cold sweat break out across his body as he stared into the thing’s blank face. He knew—without knowing how—that it was waiting. Watching.\n\n\n\nThat night, Eric woke with a start. The room was cold, the kind of chill that cuts through your bones. He glanced at the clock—3:12 a.m. Something felt wrong.\n\n\n\nAnd then he heard it.\n\n\n\nA soft tap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\n\nEric’s breath caught in his throat. The sound was coming from the window.\n\n\n\nSlowly, he turned his head. There, on the other side of the glass, was the figure. It was closer than ever, pressed against the window, its head tilted unnaturally, as though it were studying him. Its hand was resting on the glass, fingers tapping rhythmically.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Eric couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. He stared at the thing in horrified disbelief, his heart pounding in his ears.\n\n\n\nThen, with a sudden burst of terror, he grabbed Lisa’s arm, shaking her awake.\n\n\n\n“Lisa, wake up! It’s here!”\n\n\n\nLisa opened her eyes groggily, but before she could ask what was happening, a loud crack echoed through the room. The window shattered, glass spraying across the floor. The figure was gone, but the cold air rushed in, biting at their skin.\n\n\n\nPanicking, they fled the house, jumping into their car and driving through the night without looking back.\n\n\n\nThey never returned to the farmhouse. When they called the police the next morning, no one believed their story. The officers found nothing unusual, no signs of forced entry—only the shattered window. But Eric knew what he had seen, and so did Lisa.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes, late at night, when he’s alone, Eric can still hear it—the soft tap, tap, tap—just outside the window. Always watching. Always waiting.\n\n\n\n*next story* \n\n\n\n\n“The full terror of what’s inside the mirror is too long to share here.

It didn't feel quite like a nightmare when I was in it, it was as if I knew all \"the rules\" of what to do in such a situation, but when I remember it now it does seem like creepypasta material. In fact, shortly after I'd woken up I was convinced that I dreamed about some kind of well-know creepypasta or SCP, but nothing really comes to mind.\n\nHere is my attempt at describing it in detail:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes, a strange door appears in apartment buildings. In some cases, it appears in random spots that don’t quite make sense, where there is usually nothing; in other cases, it “replaces” one of the normal apartment doors.\n\nThe door itself doesn’t look like anything special, but it’s simply not one of the doors that have always been in that building (it can look very similar to them, though). Usually, it’s either unlocked, or you can unlock it with your own keys.\n\nWhat’s behind the door looks like a pretty ordinary apartment at first glance, even quite familiar, like the one where you or someone you know might live. There are no people inside, but there may be a TV working, and you can even find some food like cookies or some other tasty snack on the kitchen table. There may also be pets (mostly cats); they aren’t afraid of you and can actually be quite cuddly and affectionate.\n\nOverall, the apartment seems quite cozy, even welcoming, as if the owner’s been expecting guests.\n\nHowever, this “new apartment” also has something strange about it. For example, when you enter, you may feel a bit dizzy and disoriented for a moment, and once you are fine, you suddenly see that you’ve closed the entrance door and taken your shoes off, even though you have no memory of it. In fact, it can be quite hard to find where your shoes have gone to: they may be somewhere in a room you haven’t even entered yet, or hidden in some closet you’ve never opened, or maybe nowhere at all. You can find similar-looking shoes, or shoes that look like some of the other ones you own, but they are NOT your shoes.\n\nThe other bizarre thing becomes obvious once you look outside – the view from the window simply makes no sense. You may have entered the apartment on the ground floor, but from the inside, it looks as if it’s at least on the 10^(th) story, if not higher – the building itself may not even have that many floors. Besides that, the surrounding neighborhood is eerily empty: it can be the middle of a sunny summer day when you enter, and yet there is no one outside, and the sun is getting slowly blocked by encroaching grey clouds.\n\nOnce you’ve looked around the place for enough time, you may also find another strange door. It’s black and looks pretty heavy, and its placement is bizarre as well: it can be found inside a closet, or in the bathroom. There is no door handle or keyhole from your side, so you can’t open it. However, there is an eyehole, and you can see some kind of dusty and cluttered room through it, but not much else.\n\nThe longer you stay in the apartment, the more odd things start to happen. Remember the TV that was on? It will now occasionally show ads in foreign languages you can at least somewhat understand. These ads are all unique, but they do have one thing in common: they all tell you to flee… but not from the apartment. They tell you that you should flee FROM the outside world TO the apartment, that it’s just not safe outside.\n\nYou can also start finding notes scattered across the apartment. They are all written in some foreign language, like the ads, except now you can’t really understand any of it. The moment you look away, they seem to disappear without a trace, only for new ones to appear somewhere else.\n\nIf there are any pets, they start to get a bit… too affectionate. They will follow you everywhere, block your path, make lots of noises, etc. You may also start to notice that they aren’t quite the same anymore: their bodies seem to subtly change every time you look at them, and, given enough time, they morph into a completely different animal, and you may not even be sure if such a creature exists on Earth (still cuddly, though)\n\nFinally, when you look outside again, the sky will be completely overcast. On the horizon, you can also now see some kind of black dot floating in the air.\n\nAnd it seems like it’s approaching you.\n\nIt looks quite distant, slow, and may seem to stop completely at times, but the moment you turn away and look back at the window, you will see IT.\n\nDull grey fur. Dead eyes, too big for its head. No pupils, no eyelids. A faint glow. It looks in your direction, but its stare is also completely vacant.\n\nSeconds pass. The Thing is motionless. It simply floats outside your window, showing no signs of life.\n\nOnly its head and neck are visible. It looks like some kind of taxidermied big cat, similar to a lion, but the proportions seem off (like the eyes being too big). Besides that, instead of a normal lion’s mane it seems to have almost human-like white hair: unkempt, extremely long, and flowing.\n\nThe Thing slowly drifts to the side and disappears from your view. Everything seems silent. You look away from the window again.\n\nBANG!\n\nSomeone’s banging on the window. It’s only just one window at first, but soon you start hearing it everywhere. You look back at the window, ready to see the Thing trying to get inside.\n\nInstead, you see human faces. Familiar faces. Faces that belong to people you almost seem to know. They bang on the windows with their hands. They shout. They talk.\n\nThey say that it’s not safe outside, that you must not leave the apartment. That you must let them in.\n\nDO NOT listen to them.\n\nYou MUST leave this place. DO NOT take anything from the apartment with you.\n\nAs you rush to the entrance to leave the apartment, you can make out a new noise among the cacophony of banging and voices – the sound of that mysterious black door slowly unlocking.\n\nYou MUST leave.\n\nYou MUST lock the entrance door behind you.\n\nAfter you’ve locked the door, DO NOT look back\n\nWalk down the stairs, no matter how long it takes. DO NOT use the elevator.\n\nYou are safe ONLY once you leave the building completely.\n\nDO NOT come back alone."},"258":{"title":"I need help finding this creepypasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fo658u\/i_need_help_finding_this_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"metalpastaboiii","selftext":"I don't know who wrote the story and it was narrated by a creepypasta YouTuber.

My nightly routine follows a chaotic rhythm of dosing off for 30-40 minutes at a time while panic dreams keep my mind locked in fear, often spilling into reality; twisting my perception of the dark in my room to a barely lucid void of unrecognizable horror. Tonight is no different.\n\nAfter 38 minutes of what almost no one would call rest, I woke to the vague realization that sleep deprivation is probably worth saving my last two Xanax for a night that my terrors become tangible, so l turn on my computer and plunge myself into the unhinged cesspool that is Reddit.\n\nI almost always find that immersing my mind into a world of nonsensical bullshit on the internet suppresses the gnawing fear in the back of my skull like a rat scratching frantically to get out of my head. After 3 hours of scrolling in some sub related to the dark web, my eyes have been subjected to enough torment for the evening, and I attempt putting my mind to rest.\n\nA faint voice echoes in the back of my subconscious, \"sleep\". Like a whisper that doesn't cease reminding me to fear my own unconscious mind, further validating the idea that I'm not the only one in this prison.\n\nAs that thought forces me back into the reflective pool of warping nether of my computer screen, I'm greeted by a familiar face. The portrait I see is my own, but slightly younger and distorted. A smile corkscrews it's way across my face and I can't look away.\nHaving been in this plane before I recognize the state of my night terror and attempt to open my eyes; in vain. All my attempts to cry out are met with a suppressing void of sound. The longer I attempt to remove my consciousness from this hell, the more I'm reminded of its futility. I give up resistance and watch in third person as my distorted self begins creeping from room to room, first stopping at my younger sisters door. \"Do you smell her? Can you taste what I taste?\" The entity turns to face me and I watch as my body with that horrific smile contorts itself inhumanly and crawls on all fours onto my sister's bed. I try to wake her. I scream with all the air that my lungs have to offer, and no sound is released.\nI watch as this demon rips my 11 year old sister into pieces, halting only once my tears run out and I've given in to the horror unfolding before me.\n\nThe figure continues,\nambulating in a twisted fashion on all fours, backwards, forever staring me in the eyes with that drooling, misshapen smirk, as it slaughters my parents in the same disgusting fashion as my younger sister. \"What have we done, David? How could you?\nWhat will your grandmother think David?\" The monster disappears for a moment and I'm able to force my eyes open.\nI'm sitting upright at my computer. The screen has long since cycled through to the automatic shut off setting. The sun has begun to creep through the holes in my blackout curtains as I pull myself out of my chair and walk down the dark hallway to the bathroom. \"Day 23 without more than a few hours of Good sleep\" I think to myself. \"I need to figure this shit out\". I turn the shower knob and wait for the water to heat up. I look into the mirror and see a face that doesn't belong to me. I feel my mouth twisted into a painful, crooked grin and a deafening roar of maniacal laughter fills my head. I am covered in blood. We are covered in blood. I've won. I've made my way into our conscious mind.\n\"Sleeeeep. Sleeeeeeeep.\" His cries in the back of my mind grow fainter by the moment as I lick the blood off of our hands.\nI feast.\n\n"},"261":{"title":"Game over","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fo32bo\/game_over\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"eyesfilmsoficial","selftext":"\nDavid siempre había sido un chico promedio, pero su vida cambió radicalmente cuando descubrió Fortnite. Lo que comenzó como una simple distracción después de la escuela, rápidamente se convirtió en su mayor obsesión. Cada tarde, después de clases, corría a su habitación, encendía su consola, y se sumergía en la pantalla durante horas, intentando mejorar, alcanzar más victorias, y ser el mejor.\n\nAl principio, su familia no le dio importancia. \"Solo está jugando\", decían sus padres. Pero conforme las semanas pasaron, David comenzó a cambiar. Los deberes escolares empezaron a quedar de lado, las llamadas de sus amigos fueron ignoradas, y las cenas familiares dejaron de ser parte de su rutina. Comía en su cuarto, rodeado de envoltorios de comida rápida y latas de refresco. Su vida se redujo a la pantalla de su televisor, donde el mundo virtual era más importante que cualquier cosa en la realidad.\n\nDía y noche, el sonido de los disparos, las construcciones rápidas y las voces de otros jugadores llenaban su habitación. La luz del sol se apagó para David, que ahora apenas dormía. Sus padres, preocupados, trataron de intervenir.\n\n—David, tienes que parar un poco —le decía su madre, tratando de que bajara a cenar o, al menos, saliera a tomar aire.\n\n—Solo una partida más —respondía él, sin despegar los ojos de la pantalla.\n\nPero esa \"partida más\" se alargaba por horas. Su cuerpo comenzó a reflejar su estilo de vida. David engordaba día tras día, consumiendo cantidades absurdas de comida chatarra para mantenerse despierto. El ejercicio era inexistente, y su piel se volvió pálida, cubierta de grasa. Las ojeras oscurecieron su rostro, y su postura se encorvó frente a la pantalla.\n\nLos profesores comenzaron a llamar a sus padres. Las calificaciones de David cayeron en picada. Las faltas se acumulaban, pero a él no le importaba. \"El colegio es una pérdida de tiempo\", pensaba. \"Lo importante es ser el mejor jugador.\"\n\nLos meses pasaron, y mientras más se obsesionaba, más deterioraba su salud mental y física. La pantalla era su única conexión con el mundo, y el sonido de la consola, su único compañero constante. La realidad dejó de tener sentido para él. Comenzó a confundir los dos mundos: a veces, mientras caminaba por su casa (en las raras ocasiones que lo hacía), imaginaba estar recogiendo suministros o construyendo rampas en el aire.\n\nUn día, mientras jugaba en línea con un grupo de desconocidos, David se sintió extraño. Sus dedos, que siempre habían sido rápidos en los controles, empezaron a temblar. El sudor caía por su frente, pero no de la emoción del juego, sino de un cansancio profundo que no había sentido antes. Su corazón latía rápido, demasiado rápido. Le dolía el pecho, pero lo ignoró. \"Solo una partida más\", se dijo.\n\nSus ojos comenzaron a desenfocar la pantalla. Los personajes y las armas se mezclaban en un caleidoscopio de colores borrosos. Su respiración se volvía pesada, pero aún así, no se apartó del juego. No podía. No quería. Sentía que, si se detenía, perdería todo lo que había logrado.\n\nEn un último intento por concentrarse, David tomó otro bocado de pizza y una gran bebida de refresco. Pero su cuerpo, agotado y colapsado por la mala alimentación y la falta de movimiento, ya no podía más. El dolor en su pecho se intensificó, una presión insoportable que lo hizo soltar el control. Se llevó las manos al corazón, intentando calmar lo que estaba sucediendo, pero no funcionó.\n\nCayó hacia atrás, su silla rodó unos centímetros y él quedó tendido en el suelo, mirando el techo de su habitación. Los sonidos del juego seguían en segundo plano. Su pantalla seguía viva, pero él no.\n\nHoras después, su madre lo encontró, su cuerpo inmóvil, con el control aún en la mano. El cuarto estaba desordenado, lleno de comida a medio consumir, y la pantalla seguía mostrando la partida. La consola seguía encendida, pero el corazón de David ya no latía.\n\nLos médicos confirmaron lo que su cuerpo ya había dejado en evidencia: había muerto por obesidad mórbida y complicaciones cardíacas derivadas de su sedentarismo extremo. Su vida se apagó, consumida por un juego que, para él, lo era todo.\n\nEn la pantalla de la consola, el mensaje final de la partida aún brillaba: \"Game Over.\"\n\n\n"},"262":{"title":"What is the september thing about?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fo0hgf\/what_is_the_september_thing_about\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Brandigoon50","selftext":"I'm pretty confused because I didn't see this \"i cant remember,  what happened in september\" thing last year.

We would try to change the baby napoleon clothes to normal baby clothes, but he would always end up in Napoleon clothes. \n\nThen there was a time where we accepted it and just allowed our baby to wear the Napoleon clothes. There was this nagging feeling inside my mind about how I could fix this mess. I would try to change my baby to wear normal clothes and then in a blink of an eye, my baby was in Napoleon clothes. I would shout and scream, and my parents and relatives would also make remarks about my baby in Napoleon clothes. It was then that we knew that our baby must think that it is Napoleon or something. \n\nWe would try to tell our baby that he is not Napoleon. Then we found something else about our baby. It could also see the future as it's eyes turned white. Now all of the future seers eyes turn white when they see the future. Everyone pretty much ignored yhe Napoleon clothes and were delighted that our baby was a future seer. I am ashamed to say that my parents would show my baby the lottery tickets, and then when my baby sons eyes turned white, he was obviously seeing numbers. \n\nMy baby cannot talk though or even know what numbers are. So when my parents started shouting at my infant baby, I banned them from ever seeing him. It's really silent in the house right now and my baby is wearing Napoleon uniform again. I try to dress him up like a normal baby but like I said as soon as I turn around, my baby is napoleon clothes again. I try to tell my baby that it isnt Napoleon and that it is a normal baby. It then started to see the future again and it was just speaking baby talk again. \n\nI don't think my wife can accept my infant baby boy to thinking he is Napoleon. She just wants to dress him up as a normal baby, but our baby thinks he is Napoleon.

It's a genius idea and one I had come up with myself. Paying tax is a tiresome game for me and one which has been a thorn on my side. So I am always trying to dodge paying tax and the tax man is my devil. I am sure that I am a devil to other people, mainly the poor folk as I take so much from them. I don't want to pay tax and I have found a way round it. \n\nI find an extremely old person who has no connection to any of their relatives, due to family troubles. I then go up to them and I make them feel good. Then I set up a trust fund which is owned by them, I then put billions of pounds in there. Then a contract is drawn which says when the old individual dies, I will get the whole trust fund. Here in the UK there are trust funds which are protected from tax. The old individual has no idea what I am doing but when they die, I inherit my billions without paying tax or sometimes really low tax. \n\nI think it's genius and I have been doing it for many years now. I find a lonely old dying person, and I make a trust fund in their name and I then put billions of pounds in it, where also I am the soul hier to it. It's amazing. I have saved myself so much from paying tax and I really love myself for it. I really do think I am amazing at figuring this out all on my own and no body has sussed it out yet. \n\nThen there is 1 old person who made a trust fund in their name, and I put billions of pounds in the trust fund and where I am the soul hier to it. The lovely old woman signed it and everything. The one problem though is that she hasn't died yet. I then asked one of the workers about when she is supposedly to die. I them get told that she has been alive for 400 years and she doesn't seem to die at all. Her immortality is proving to be a problem for me. I need her to die so that I could inherit the billions that I put into the trust fund in her name. \n\nThen I put something in her food to kill her bit she is still alive? Maybe this one is a loss. I've still got other old people dying and me inheriting my billions without having to pay tax. We all make a loss sometimes.

I remember loving the story when I was younger, but now I’m realizing it’s because I wasn’t thinking of the original story whatsoever lmao. \n\nI never remembered the story in great detail since then, but I always thought the story roughly went like this.\n\nJeff was 15-17 and had a sister. I remember the sister had just gotten a boyfriend who was abusive to her. Jeff’s sister, her boyfriend and his friend group would hang out a lot and one day when Jeff’s parents were gone she had them come over and they were hanging out in the garage or something. I remember the boyfriend started being verbally or physically abusive to the sister and just being a dick to Jeff as well. So Jeff tried standing up to the group and ended up getting beaten by the group and covered in bleach and fuel, then getting lit on fire with a match or something like that. Then after he recovered his eyelids and cheeks were burnt off, which gave him his opened eyes and smile.

The agony felt like white hot daggers throbbing in my chest as I awoke with a fever addled gasp. A powerful hand pressed with firm but careful force upon my shoulder as I tried to rise. ‘Careful my friend’, a deep resonant voice rumbled, ‘you are lucky to be alive’.\nMy vision swam with a kaleidoscope of blurry lights and shadows as I struggled to focus on the voice. I took a deep breath and focused, my Order honed mind taking over as I surrendered to other senses. The cool kiss of the metal slab on my back coupled with the familiar thrum of machine noise spoke volumes. That and the sterile smell was something you experienced often in the early days of training. I was in a medical bay. Slowly my vision returned with my calm breathes as the room itself came into stark focus. The familiar sight of The Orders primary Med Bay met my returning gaze.\n \nStanding over me, hand still placed upon my shoulder was the welcome sight of my best friend and mentor, Alaric Harker. ‘Alaric, you have no idea how glad I am to see your face’.\nRemoving his hand from my shoulder and walking across to a small chair at the foot of the slab, Alaric replied. ‘You are lucky I found you when I did’.\n‘I didn’t think there were any other Hunters in the Appalachians’, I muttered with difficulty.\n‘None posted, but when I heard they sent you so soon after the Wendigo, I hastened to dispatch my mark to come to your aid’.\nI slowly began to rise, the pain beginning to lessen as a flush of ice cold fluid pumped through my veins from the canular in my hand. ‘How long have I been out’?\n‘Not long, only twelve hours’, Alaric replied. Twelve hours? Not long at all I thought. ‘The Lycan?’ Alaric reached into his grey combat vest and pulled out a cigarette, his other hand drawing a flip lighter from one of the other many pouches, and lit the cigarette, taking in a deep lungful. ‘Dead and disposed of my friend, you did some fine blade work based off those wounds. Still, based off how I found you, it took a little too long to despatch.’\nI shrugged and moved to stand. The cool rush off blood to my head almost made me pass out. Alaric reached to steady me but I waved him away. Looking down at the canular and then across to the almost empty IV bag, I glanced at Alaric. ‘That’s what happens when I get sent off alone, not fully recovered’. I gestured down to my hand, ‘help me with this thing, will you?’ Alaric put aside his cigarette, and with practiced hands, slowly went to work on the canular.\n \n‘So, what else happened while I was asleep? Is there a new mark?’ Alaric held some cotton wool to my hand as he reached for some surgical tape, then chuckled to himself before replying. ‘There just so happens that there is. Multiple in fact, but you need more rest. The IV is full of Regen fluid, amongst other things, but I would rather you heal up for a while first.’ Sighing to myself I pondered. It took a month to almost heal from the wendigo fight and I lost a lot of muscle mass. I recovered most of it before I took on the Lycan, looking down at my bare form I noticed with curiosity that I had lost little mass, and that the wounds themselves were but a small handful of scars. I looked up at Alaric and before I could voice my surprise he commented. ‘It’s been a while since you were last here Cypher, the Order as recently finished a new batch of Regen. A much stronger concoction which as it turns out, is timely.’ I narrowed my eyes, divining what was coming next from his tone.\n‘Vampires Cypher. A brood of them. We got contact from the Watchers during your Lycan hunt. The wretched things have been coming down from their lairs and taking hikers with greater frequency.’ I thought about his words for a moment. It wasn’t particularly unusual for vampires to take hikers, but the increase in frequency suggested that the brood was either trying to expand its territory, or had grown too large to maintain itself through the usual number of killings. Vampires you see, tried to avoid killing too many people in one area as it tended to catch our attention. For centuries we have managed to hold them back from society, but the modern age and the expansion of human cities into the wilderness has made that job a lot harder. ‘Where exactly is this brood located, and when do we leave?’ I watched as Alaric moved over to a metal desk, near the exit door and retrieve a small folder. ‘In here are all the details.’ I took the proffered folder and quickly scanned its contents.\n \n- Vampire brood infestation, threat level Epsilon.\n- Location, Blue Ridge Mountains, Appalachia.\n- Dual Kill Team advised, followed by full containment of surrounding areas populace for full spectrum mind wipe.\n \n‘Dual Kill team’, I looked at Alaric questioningly, ‘We are to Hunt together?’\n‘Yes, my friend, it has been quite some time, but neither of us are capable of taking this one on alone.’ I smiled. Not since I was an initiate had I hunted with my mentor. Usually speaking, The Order only sent one hunter per mark. Dual Kill Teams were a rare thing. This brood must have them worried. ‘When do we leave?’ I asked. ‘In three days, I want to make sure you are fully healed’.\nThe drive out to the location seemed to take forever. The anticipation of the fight to come and the enormity of the situation forced cool spike of adrenaline through my veins. Vampires, especially a brood of them, were difficult foes. The speed and strength of the beasts were more than most humans could handle. I had fought them before and could attest to the primal ferocity of those encounters. Vampires you see, are not anything like the popular media has led people to assume. They don’t sparkle in the sun, nor are they charismatic romantics with nothing better to do than embrace innocent high school students. No, they are voracious predators with few equals.\n \nOur road led us not to a dark mansion on a mountain top, nor to some billionaires’ pad. It led us deep into the wilderness, through near impassable terrain, over rocky outcrops and through dark forests. Our destination was a dark cave complex off a narrow dirt path, thirty kilometres from the nearest population centre. The truck came to a stop with a small whine of overused brakes. Looking out of the rolled down window in the pre-dawn light, the forest was eerily silent. No birds chirping their morning song. No night insects made even the slightest music. The area itself held a deep oppressive feel, as if the forest itself urged us to leave. I locked eyes with Alaric and nodded. Silently we left the truck, retrieved our gear and took inventory.\n \nThe gear we required for this was more or less what the movies did get somewhat right. Small automatic pistols full of silver inlaid bullets, a recent addition to the arsenal. We traditionally aimed to drop our targets at greater range, with higher calibre bullets. Vampires were usually too aware for single shot weapons, and most of the time they got the jump on you. These would help us even the odds that the vampires had in speed. Close combat weaponry consisted of large almost sword like combat knives, edged in silver and razor sharp. We were both clad head to foot in dark grey combat fatigues with built in arm and leg protection of unique Order design. Vampire claws could scythe through common equipment like a knife through butter. Our gear was different. A special composite material, tough as steel but flexible. It wouldn’t completely turn away the strikes, but it would make it somewhat safer. Killing the creatures would require head or heart destruction followed by burning the corpses afterwards. The caves would be dark. Our solution for this was the addition of Lumen serum to our bandoleers of preventatives. It allowed us to see in perfect darkness, albeit not in full colour. I reached into my bandoleer and took out the Lumen serum, along with the Regen. Unscrewing the caps, I downed both in quick succession. Looking over to Alaric I noticed he was doing similar preparations.\n \nWe headed off at a brisk pace, the cool morning air burned my lungs as we covered ground towards the caves. The morning light was just breaking through the trees, lighting up our path and warming my face. Attacking during the day gave us the obvious advantage of an escape route to the purifying sun if needed, and guaranteed that the majority of the brood would be resting. ‘I’ll take the lead. Watch my back and remember your training’, Alaric spoke with confidence. ‘The Watchers intel puts the numbers of this brood at close to fifteen’. I nodded, followed closely behind Alaric as he led the way through the mossy aperture of the cave entrance. At a glance that might seem insurmountable. What must be remembered is that Vampires were not the immortal creatures from the fables. Apex predators for sure, but not supernaturally powerful.\n \nI followed Alaric’s’ movements down the dark tunnel, the suns warmth and light fading at our backs until it disappeared entirely. Our vison shifted in the low light, as the Lumen serum revealed the darkness, casting the tunnel in a dim grey countenance. Alaric held up a hand and crouched suddenly. I paused and immediately took a knee, pistol and blade drawn. Peering into the gloom, I took a deep breath and focused. The tunnel ahead curved to the right and slightly downwards to an open grotto. The sound of water dripping off the granite walls echoed with a rhythmic beat on the damp mossy ground. A soft, barely perceptible clicking sound emanated from up ahead. Echolocation. Vampires could see, though not very well. They relied on a form of echolocation to communicate and to perceive the world around them. Alaric motioned direction and distance with the Orders hand sign. Following his code, I looked slightly up and to the left of the vast chamber. About fifty feet away, hanging from the wall and facing towards us was a Vampire. Its pale almost translucent skin was just visible to my altered vision. It had heard us, but as far as I could guess, not seen us. Its gaunt humanoid form twitched as it moved across the wall. Long too spindly arms ended in four razor sharp claws that held it fast. Thin membranous wings connected its middle forearms to its lower back. Two slightly thicker, but powerful reverse jointed legs terminated in three clawed toes. The head twisted spasmodically as it clicked to determine our location. Alaric signed that it was alone. A sentry. We waited to see what the creature would do next. It was too far away to engage without noise, and we did not want to risk alerting the brood.\n \nThe vampire continued to crawl, sniffing the air clicking as it moved. A moment later, our plan went to hell. A keening screech echoed through the chamber and a blur of movement from directly above followed it. I cursed inwardly. The sentry was a distraction. Above our heads a vampire hidden from sight in a small alcove had sprung the trap. What happened next was quick. I watched as Alaric, quicker than I have ever seen him move, discarding pretence of subterfuge, draw a bead on the descending vampire. A moment later, a three around burst of gunfire rang out with a staccato crack. Two of the shots took the creature centre mass, whilst the third cored the head in an explosion of greyscale viscera. The vampire dropped like a stone to the cold floor and then the fight was on in earnest. The vampire on the far side of the chamber had closed the gap in the meantime. Raising my pistol, I took quick aim and fired a burst. The now familiar crack echoed loudly as the bullets flew towards their target. The vampire, having seen its brood mate killed, jinked to the side. The shots flew through the air it had just vacated and slammed into the wall behind it. Alaric turned to help but was set upon by another creature as they started to pour from hidden alcoves. I brought my blade on guard just as the creature reached me, claws slashing at my throat. I deflected the first two swipes and dove under the third. The creature’s momentum carried it forward for several feet, which gave me time to roll as I hit the ground, turning into a half kneeling stance to take aim. Just as the creature turned, I put three shots into its chest, dropping it where it stood.\n \nPained screeches off to my left told me Alaric was still engaged. Turning quickly, I entered the fray. I saw two additional corpses at his feet, my mentor making quick work of the first wave. He was engaged in a fierce melee with a two others. He spun, ducked and weaved under bestial blows, almost inhuman in his speed. I took advantage and dropped one with gunfire, before joining the melee, my pistol clicking as it ran dry. Together we attacked as one. Slice, block, evade, switch position, slice. In a matter of moments, the vampire fell under a storm of silver edged steel.\nThe echoes of combat slowly receded, giving us a moments respite. Looking around, I saw no immediate danger so I took a knee as Alaric rolled his shoulders. ‘Well, that was stupid of us’, he remarked with a coughing breath. I could only agree. Falling for the obvious trap was not the greatest start to the hunt.\n \nRe arming ourselves with fresh ammunition, and baring no injury we moved further into the cave. Slowly and methodically, we moved, our footsteps echoing off the stone walls. I started to wonder, and I could tell by Alaric’s gaze, that he was thinking the same as I. Where was the second wave? We had made enough noise in the entry chamber to alert the others, of that I was certain. Still, we continued deeper into the musty smelling cave. Up ahead the tunnel widened and we were met by a sour faecal smell. I signed Nest to Alaric. He nodded and returned the sign for, Eyes up. The answer to our worries was soon revealed. Before us stood a smaller chamber, covered with stone columns, no doubt created by the meeting of stalactites and stalagmites. The smell was worse has we entered, but that was the least of our worries. Ahead in the greyscale gloom stood four more vampires guarding a fifth and much larger vampire. A brood mother. That explained why we hadn’t been attacked further. They knew we would either leave and thus not bother to follow, or that we would reach this final terminus. Obviously confident in this small space, with a brood mother to back them.\n \nThe brood mother gazed menacingly in our direction. Standing fully ten feet tall, it dwarfed the vampires guarding it. In all others ways it was identical to the smaller brood members, other than a crest of dark, razor sharp spines that jutted out of its back and rattled as it took deep resonant breathes in and out. Alaric looked at me and nodded. Together we advanced into the chamber, weapons at the ready and eyes focused on the monumental task that lay before us. A guttural roar, that vibrated the very blood in our body, tore through the chamber from the gaping maw of the brood mother. On que, the lesser vampires made their move. Two came directly for us as the other two circled to the left and right to catch us in a pincer movement. Not skipping a beat, I raised my pistol and emptied the clip at my target as Alaric simultaneously unloaded on his. The two lead vampires having almost crossed the distance, practically evaporated into clouds of warm vitae. I discarded my now empty pistol and brought my blade up for close combat. These next two vampire were quick, very quick. My strikes were deftly avoided and pain exploded across my chest as the vampire’s swipe knocked me from my feet. Time slowed to a crawl as the beast flew in for the kill. Recovering my senses quickly, I rolled to the side as I brought my blade up to slice at the exposed underside of the vampire, eliciting a pained screech of frustration. Continuing the momentum of my roll, I came to standing just in time to slip two claw strikes as my blade thrusted home, taking the creature in the heart and spilling its hot blood over my arm. Twisting my blade once, I wrenched it free and turn to see how Alaric fared. His vampire and torn a wound across his shoulder but in return appeared to be down, its head missing from its torso as the neck pumped out blood across the ground.\n \nThe brood mother howled in frustration and flew with surprising speed for something that size, and encircled Alaric in a fierce embrace as he turned to engage it. ‘Alaric!’, I screamed in horror, as I rushed into my mentor’s aid. Late, much too late. The brood mother knocked Alaric’s thrust aside with contemptuous ease and promptly tore out his throat. It dropped Alaric’s corpse, a look of shock upon his face inn death, to the hard ground with a wet crunch. My vision blurred with equal parts rage and anguish at the site of my slain friend and mentor.\nThe brood mother turned, a mocking look on its face as I dove into a slide, retrieving Alaric’s blade on the way to rising up to my feet, both weapons poised. ‘Prepare for death foul beast!’ I screamed in rage. The creature advanced, slowly and methodically, like a lion stalking soon to be dead prey. I moved in a semi-circle and waited for my opening. The beast moved first, a contemptuous over hand strike at my head as it came within range, attempting the same grab it had used to dispatch Alaric. Having seen the move, I took the risk and ran forward under the swipe, surprising the vampire with the bold move. One blade I plunged under its armpit, through towards its heart, hard bone arresting the blade and the second found purchase under neath the chin. The vampire bellowed with surprise, coughing up dark blood as it stumbled back. Not letting up, I gladly took its next strike across the face, its claws scraping across bone as I pulled the blade from its jaw to ram repeatedly into its heart. Three strikes later, we both fell in a heap onto the ground. It dead and me opened across the face to the bone.\n \nLaying still, I took deep gasping breathes, as I fumbled for my bandoleer. Finding the Regen fluid, I took another vial down and promptly passed out.\nI awoke in cold agony sometime later. My eyes almost glued shut from blood, with the tell-tale sign of white hot fire the only thing telling me I still had my sight. I raised my hands to my face to feel my wounds. They seemed to have mostly closed. The new Regen fluid was a marvel to be sure. Raising myself to sitting, I observed the environment around me. What met my eyes was an Order cleansing team. A strong hand reached down to me which I took as I was steadily raised to my feet. ‘How exactly are you here so fast?’ I groaned in pain.\nThe dark clothed man, stared at me a moment before replying. ‘I assume Alaric didn’t have time to tell you, but the gear you wear has been outfitted with tracking and heart rate monitors.’ I shook my head to indicate that I wasn’t, before he continued.\n‘When we saw Alaric had fallen, we sent in the team straight away, fearing that you too soon would fall before you got a chance to clear the nest. It took us six hours to get here. It’s amazing that your survived’. I dipped my head in sorrow as my gaze fell to the body bag that held Alaric. Holding back tears I nodded numbly. Sensing that now was not a good time to ask for my report, the man graciously led me by the arm from the chamber and outside into the bright mid afternoon sun. The effects of the Lumen serum had long worn off, but still it stung my eyes. The heat, normally a welcome embrace, felt cold against my skin. Alaric was gone, and with him my only true friend. With aid, I limped back down the trail, slowly and painfully for more than one reason. Waiting at the base of the climb was an impromptu Order camp. I was led to the med bay to be seen and debriefed. All the while, the image of Alaric’s death stare haunting my thoughts. I lay down on the cold steel slab, closed my eyes and fell into a disturbed slumber praying not to wake, as I relived the encounter in nightmarish detail, over and over again.\n "},"273":{"title":"Which stuck with you?

I downloaded it, excited for a light-hearted experience.\n\nAt first, everything was delightful. I spent hours breeding my dogs, watching them grow limbs and mutate into strange, endearing creatures. But soon, something began to feel off. My dogs would behave strangely, their eyes sometimes glinting in a way that seemed almost... sentient.\n\nAs I continued playing, I noticed odd messages appearing on the screen. “Help us” and “We are trapped.” I dismissed them as glitches, part of the game’s charm.

First of all, know that I am not a good storyteller and that I am writing this at my own pace, so excuse me.\n\n\n\nA month ago I was sitting alone in my room watching TV as late as usual, I felt hungry and went to get something from the kitchen, but the fridge and oven were empty. I put on my outdoor clothes and asked my dad for some money to buy some groceries since there was nothing to eat in the house, it was 11pm and my dad was almost asleep, but he let me take some money and go, so I took the money and left the apartment and closed the door behind me, there was a small store in the far north of the neighborhood that was open until 3am, I left the building and headed towards it, and even though it was July and the place I live in is very hot even at night, I felt terribly cold, it might seem normal since the weather in my area is very changeable, but the atmosphere and aura of the place itself suggested otherwise.\n\nI arrived at the store and entered it, and the first thing I noticed was that the salesman was not there, and the second thing I noticed, the counter was covered in blood... In a situation like this I should have run away immediately, but I remembered that in such situations in movies, the perpetrator suddenly appears behind you and hits you on the head from behind and kills you instantly. I looked behind me quickly but there was no one, so I quickly left the store and started running towards my building, and in the middle of the way, I heard the sound of footsteps running behind me, I didn't even dare to look back, I kept running and running and running, until one of those running behind me threw a wooden stick at me, but it didn't hit me.  The entrance to our building was a completely metal door with no small window. As soon as I entered, I closed the door tightly, and immediately the people who were running after me arrived, whom I knew were two from their screaming. They kept banging on the door and screaming at me and cursing me to open the door. Under the influence of adrenaline and excitement, I started cursing them too. From their voices, I knew who they were. They were well-known thugs in our neighborhood. They were known for selling drugs and knives and getting involved with their friends in many fights here and there in cafes and alleys.\n\n\n\nAt this point you will say, 'Where is the horror here? This is a story about you and your neighborhood thugs. What does that have to do with us?' The weirdness begins here.\n\n\nWhile the two thugs outside and I were cursing each other and insulting each other's mothers, I noticed that they were screaming hysterically and frantically and hitting the metal door brutally with their feet and fists, as if they were not in control of themselves. At first, I thought that I had gotten on their nerves to the point that they had gone crazy, but their hysterical screaming became extremely loud, and they even started hitting the door with their heads and retreating and running towards the door to break it. Here, I stopped talking and insulting them and kept looking at the door anxiously (there were no windows or glass on the door for me to see what was happening outside, the door was entirely metal, and there were also no windows on the lower floor of the building overlooking the outside).  I looked at the door in confusion and worry as I heard the thugs slamming the door, kicking it and hitting it violently with their bodies and heads to break it, and I said in a state of worry, \"Hey, what are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\"  They didn't answer me and continued screaming louder and louder like beasts until they actually started breaking the door, so I quickly went up the stairs and headed towards the floor where my apartment was, I took out my keys but they fell from my hand to the ground, only then did I hear the door of the building below completely smashed and the screams of the thugs approaching me through the stairs, I took the keys, quickly opened the door with them and entered the building and quickly closed the door behind me with the keys, as soon as I did this, suddenly the screaming inside the building stopped, the thugs stopped screaming completely, I stayed in my place in front of the door waiting for them to attack it and smash it so they could enter like they did with the door of the building..... and this is what did not happen, I stayed there in front of the door for a few minutes expecting something to happen, but nothing happened, so I relaxed and moved away from the door... I looked at the clock, it was 11:15pm, I thought about calling the police and informing them of what happened, fearing that the thugs might come back later to smash the door of my house to enter here, but I  I know they don't know which apartment I live in, maybe that's why they went to the first apartment, so I went to the kitchen, I didn't bring any groceries unfortunately, I just had a cup of water and some bread then I went to my room and changed my clothes then went to sleep..\n\n\n\n\nThe story is not over yet, many things happened after this but I only found time to write what you just read, I will complete what happened to me but first tell me what you think..

Evenings were filled with gentle drizzle, the world quiet and still as the people of town watched for thunder from the shelter of their backdoors.\n\nThis quiet stillness bode well for the autumn to come, and the Halloween to come with it. Nights like these never failed to put me in that Halloween humour, and so I decided to explore town with my camera, capturing any scenes I could find of the eerie and uncanny while the town gently slept.\n\nI paused at a huge tree blowing in the gentle night breeze, the orange glow of a streetlight casting dappled shadows onto the grass. I set up my camera and began recording, hoping that no cars would pass by and ruin the audio of the rustling leaves.\n\nNone did; I was alone in the silence, left to scan the shadows as the recording timer steadily grew to long minutes.\n\nAs I finished up, I turned to see a silhouette standing nearby, its features unclear in the harsh streetlight.\n\n‘That camera’s fuckin’ deadly bud! I’d say you could get some class photos with that!’\n\nHe was friendly, but I stayed on guard in case he fancied selling my camera for a song after a swift sucker-punch.\n\n‘Sure can.’ I replied. ‘It does video too - I’m getting some clips of the streets for my channel while it’s all quiet and spooky.’\n\n‘You’re talking my language now bud! If spooky is what ya want-’ he paused to wag his finger like he had just made a sale. ‘- I’ve a few stories to tell!’\n\nHe introduced himself, telling me he lived in an estate not far from where I used to live myself. He seemed a decent sort.\n\n‘What brings you out and about on a night like this yourself?’ I asked him.\n\n‘Ah, the missus kicked me out. I was gonna fly down to the 24-hour to grab a naggin if you fancied the walk?’\n\nI agreed, and he began to tell me his story along the way.\n\nHe spoke of the nearby Lover’s Lane, a small lane running down behind the petrol station we were making our way towards.\n\n‘It’s all built up now, new lights, new houses, the lot - but ya wouldn’t believe what happened down there back in the day boy… make your blood freeze so it would.’\n\nHe was clearly enjoying drawing out the story for a better build-up. I got the sense he wasn’t used to being listened to, so I indulged him. Besides, his enthusiasm for telling the tale was infectious.\n\nAs it so happened, “back in the day” was the early nineties, the best time for urban myths to spread, by word of mouth and with little to no internet to ruin them.\n\n‘The lane was just dirt, with that little rusty gate at the end.’ He waved his hand in abroad stroke in front of him, an artist painting the scene onto his canvas of night air.\n\n‘No tarmac or streetlight or nothin’, just a dirt path. People used to sneak down it for a quick joint or a shift. Speaking of which-’ he reached into his hoody pocket and produced an immaculately-rolled joint. ‘J’want half?’\n\nI politely declined. I made the right decision; he lit it up as we strolled, and the second-hand smoke alone almost floored me.\n\nHe continued his story after a deep drag of his joint, unperturbed by the Mary-Jane-miasma wafting from his mouth.\n\n‘There was this girl, she was seeing a lad who lived ‘round the corner from me. I won’t say their names now - I’m superstitious about these things. So she was doing the dirt on the lad ‘round the corner from me. She was seen going down Lover’s Lane, pretending she was going to the petrol station for some sweets-’\n\nHe paused to dig me in the ribs with his elbow. ‘But she was getting some sugar alright!’ he laughed as if he had spoken comedy gold. I couldn’t help but laugh along with him.\n\nHe took another drag.\n\n‘Mm!’ he nodded with urgency, eager to get the story moving. His expression darkened.\n\n‘She was seen anyway, and someone ratted her out. Instead of saying to to her face, the boyfriend decided to wait until she was going on one of her little “trips to the shop”, and follow her down. Sure enough, that’s what happened. He followed her down, hoping to catch her in the act.’\n\nHe paused to hold his hands out a forearms-width apart.\n\n‘And he took a knife this big with him.’\n\nWe arrived at the petrol station, the fluorescent lights and shelter seeming like a cool oasis on such a humid night. Tiny droplets of drizzle were made a misty curtain over the harsh white of the station lights.\n\nAfter talking the attendant into selling him a naggin of vodka after alcohol sale hours had ended, we took shelter beside the public washing machines next to the station, out of sight so that he could take a drink.\n\n‘So in the dark, he walks right up to them while they’re busy shiftin’, pulls the knife out on them and starts roaring his head off. The girlfriend’s fella thinks he’s about to get stabbed, so he grabs for the knife and things get messy. No lights at the time remember - so the two are rolling around in the dirt and the dark, punchin’ and stabbin’ in the heat of the moment. Then… silence.’\n\nThe body of the boyfriend is found the next day, with the knife-’ he paused to make a puncture noise with his mouth while pointing at his chest. ‘-stuck straight into his heart.’\n\nHe paused to take another mouthful of vodka.\n\n‘The girlfriend and her fella must’ve fled town, ‘cuz no one ever saw ‘em again. Good thing too after the rumours started spreadin’ - not just about them, but what was seen there in Lover’s Lane after they left...’\n\nHe shivered suddenly. ‘Fuckin’ hell, gives me shivers thinking about it.’ he said, laughing at his own unease.\n\n‘They say that the boyfriend’s ghost haunts the lane, appearing on nights like this to anyone who’ve ever even thought about doing the dirt on their girlfriends or boyfriends. He appears beside ya, as suddenly as he appeared to his girlfriend and her fella, with that big knife wound still bleeding from his heart, all bloody and pale…’\n\nHis eyes drifted to the lane just over the wall, lost in thought as he imagined the chilling sight only feet from where we stood.\n\n‘Do you want to walk down it?’ I suggested.\n\nHe shot me an incredulous half-grin, and sheepishly shook his head.\n\n‘Nahhhh man… no way. Not now.’\n\n‘Ah go on!’ I encouraged him. ‘I have my camera and all - maybe we could capture the ghost on video and get famous. Think of stories we could both tell then!’\n\nHe fidgeted for a moment, gears turning in his head. The chance of being able to tell the tale of the real thing had swayed him it seemed.\n\nWithout a word, he downed the entire remainder of his vodka, and flicked his head towards the lane. ‘Alright, ‘mon.’\n\nWe rounded the corner, and stood at the entrance to the lane. It seemed a mile long now, ending in darkness at the rusted gate that was all that remained of the old lane. I readied my camera, imagining a figure stepping forth from the shadows, knife blade glinting in the flickering streetlight…\n\n‘Of course the fuckin’ light is banjaxed!’ he said with a nervous giggle, cursing himself for agreeing to walk down with me.\n\nI began recording, and we walked steadily down the lane. The temperature seemed to drop, and the lane was filled with the sound of the gentle rain and our echoing footsteps. Our unease mounted as we neared the dark part at the end.\n\nThe gate was an old-style kissing gate, the kind that moved back and forth within a barrier so that only one person could go through at a time. My companion rushed through in his eagerness to leave the lane, which meant that if anything should appear behind me, my escape would be blocked in the long seconds it took him to walk through…\n\nI felt the hairs on my neck stand as I consciously chose not to look behind me.\n\nHe pointed to a patch of broken tarmac behind me.\n\n‘That’s where it happened. That’s where they found him. They said all the pain and anger in his heart came out in his blood, so nothing ever grew there again. Even when they tarmacced it, that spot never settled properly.’\n\nI made my own way through the gate. The man looked around him, clearly on edge, with the vodka doing little to steel his nerves.\n\nAs we walked down the hill into a housing estate, we felt the unease leave us as we left the lane behind. I ceased recording and opted to take one last photo for the road.\n\nI lined up my camera, and took a test photo to gauge the lighting. As I turned to thank the man for being my ghost hunting partner, I saw him standing agape, eyes wide with fear and stone-cold sober. Without so much as a goodbye, he ran away in a dead sprint, leaving me alone in the silent estate.\n\nI forced myself to look back at Lover’s Lane, and saw only blackness, and the light of the lane behind the gate.\n\nWith the chills on my back never dying down, I walked home, checking over my shoulder the entire time.\n\nI looked the man up on social media the next day. To my amusement, he had been tagged in several incendiary posts from who I can only assume was his now-ex girlfriend. Abusive tirades of unpunctuated vitriol covered his timeline, making liberal use of the title “two-timing scumbag” and other colourful insults.\n\nI went over the footage, and nothing really stood out. However, the photo I took revealed much more.\n\nIt had only been a test photo, and so it was somewhat shaky and poorly exposed, all noise and shadows. But I could see well enough why my companion ran so suddenly. Something my eyes hadn’t seen, but his had.\n\nI did well to walk away when I did.\n\n[This is what my camera had captured.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/loverslane-jpg-ZC7rkHf)"},"286":{"title":"How does Slenderman see?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fmtx2e\/how_does_slenderman_see\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"OrdinaryDrawer5451","selftext":"See"},"287":{"title":"My Experience in the Woods.

I sat up, but immediately hunched over hugging my stomach. I fell to my side, curling into the fetal position as I felt my organs move to their designated area. When I started to catch my breath, the pain started to ease. But as I slowly sat myself upright, I began to cry. I was in a hospital room with the same black pith on the walls and equipment. As absurd as it sounds I felt like I was cheated out of my death. The more I thought about, the angrier I got and the more I cried. As I wallowed over how unfair it all was I grabbed the collar of my shirt and blew my nose. When I pulled it away from my face I noticed it wasn't my shirt, but a hospital gown. I quickly scanned the room and I was alone. Instantly on alert I jumped off the bed. I pivoted on my foot to see three large windows behind me. They were rectangular, the top touching the ceiling and the bottom stopping at my waist. The world outside was so dark I couldn't tell if they were windows or holes. I walked up to the one in the middle, hesitating as I put my right hand on the edge. As I placed it down my palm curled around the edge as my fingertips gently kissed the outside wall. My fingers started to tingle and shiver, and my brain screamed at me to let go and run. As I began to let go I heard something faint come from the deep in the darkness. It made me hesitate, but before I could tell myself to ignore it I heard it again. This time it was a little louder, and I could hear them mumbling something. I turned back to the window and put my other hand down on the edge, the same sensation now rushing through my entire body. I ignored my better judgement and waited until I heard it again. I started leaning towards the voice as it spoke. It was a little louder, mumbling something. It started mumbling incoherently, getting louder as the seconds passed. It started to sound like multiple people were whispering over each other until it sounded like static. I started leaning farther in as I tried to figure out what the voices were saying. I started getting a headache when I noticed the voices stopped. The silence seemed unnatural, as though the darkness itself was stalking me like a predator stalks prey. I squeezed the edge of the window as my whole body tensed up.\n\n\"Why did you do it!!\"\n\nThe voice was raspy and chaotic, like multiple people were saying it. I jumped back, falling onto the bed as I slipped on the gunk on the floor. My gaze never left the window as I stayed frozen in place. My hands shook as I slowly pushed myself up. I waited terrified, waiting for some horrific monster to start crawling out the window. When nothing happened I relaxed a little bit, standing up to make my way to the door. But before I could turn around I felt a big snake slither across my feet. I slowly looked down to see what I could only assume was an anaconda due to its size. It had sharp spiked crest on the top like its spine was on the outside of its body. My head and eyes slowly scanned it, slightly turning as I followed it to the bed. The air left my lungs as I saw it wasn't a snake, but a tail. It had the same eyes as the man who'd been dragging me, and a human like body that was covered in black scales. They glistened in the dim light making it look as though it was made out of the universe itself. It had elongated fingers that ended in sharp claws, and it had two black horns growing from its forehead. It stared at me, its face missing a nose and mouth. As we both stared at each other it began to slowly close its eyes until it looked faceless. It stayed like this, the hairs on my neck standing up. I tried to sneak past it, slowly stepping over its tail. But when my foot touched the floor I heard the sound of something tearing. The bottom of the monster's face had started to slowly rip open to reveal long, skinny sharp teeth. When it stopped the torn scales and skin healed and turned into lips.\n\n\"Why did you do it!!\"\n\nIt along with the voice from outside were screaming at me. Closer to the window I abandoned the door and ran towards one of the windows. I put my hands on the sides and one foot on the bottom. Without stopping I leapt out the window, but before I could start to fall its tail shot through my upper right leg. It pulled me back through the window and slammed me onto the bed so hard it moved to the side. It ripped its tail out and began to laugh, clutching it's stomach as I groaned with pain. When it recomposed itself it spoke, but it sounded human.\n\n\"I'm gonna miss doing that.\"\n\nMy brain couldn't process what was happening, and if the creature noticed it didn't care. Tears started to squeeze out my eyes as I tried to stop myself from crying.\n\n\"Do you ever get tired of feeling bad for yourself?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything to deserve this!!\"\n\nThe words left my mouth before I realized I'd even thought them. I flinched as I waited for a swift punishment but it just stared at me as though it was expecting something. \n\n\"Where am I?\"\n\n\"Um..... A hospital?\"\n\nIt answered like I'd asked something stupidly obvious, but it didn't seem hostile. My curiosity started to whisper in my head, questions swirling around until another slipped out.\n\n\"Why am I here?\"\n\n\"You're here because you need some serious help, and this is the only place that can truly accommodate to your needs.\"\n\nIt spoke as though we were having a light hearted conversation. I didn't know why but its answer made me anxious to the point my heart twisted in pain. I did my best to stay composed as I continued.\n\n\"Where's the guy that brought me here?\"\n\nIt tilted its head, a confused look on its face.\n\n\"A guy didn't bring you here.\"\n\nNow I was confused. How could it not know who I was talking about?\n\n\"He looks like me- you know he's human. But his eyes look exactly like yours.\"\n\nIt didn't respond, its confusion turning into a look of concern. Annoyed I quickly changed the subject.\n\n\"What are you?\"\n\nIt rubbed its chin with the end of its tail.\n\n\"You don't have time for me to explain or the braincells to understand. So just slap a label on me and move on.\"\n\nIt talked with a haunting smile on its face. I sensed hostility slowly growing from it, but it still seemed willing to talk. I continued to ignore my growing anger, determined to get any information I could. \n\n\"Where-\"\n\nIt put one of its clawed hands up and spoke over me. \n\n\"Think of me like a genie, but I'll only answer three questions.\"\n\n\"I only asked two questions.\"\n\nI spoke more confidently than I felt, tensing the muscles in my face to keep a blank expression. It just laughed as though a child had tried to trick it. My anger boiled over as I decided I was better off finding my own way out. I shoved it to the side as I threw myself off the bed. I jumped on my feet, ignoring the pain from my leg as I limped as fast as I could towards the door. I wrapped one hand around the door frame when the monster's tail burst through my chest. It pushed through until it was long enough to wrap tightly around my waist, the spines cutting deep into me. I was ripped away from the door. It pulled me back to the bed keeping my feet a few inches away from the floor as I faced it. A wide smile was spread across its face like it was excited. \n\n\"Awesomesauce we're skipping the tutorial this time.\"\n\nThe tone of its voice made my skin crawl with fear. It raised its right clawed hand, its elongated fingers shrinking into human like ones. I stared at its new hand impressed and terrified me. \n\n\"Well don't be rude.\"\n\nIt motioned its hand towards me. Hesitantly I raised my hand, pausing again before opening my palm and stretching out my fingers. I slowly brought my hand forward, causing it to get more excited. As it rushed its hand into mine they collided with a loud SMACK!! My hand stung as I pulled it away. I looked down at it to see if it was red, noticing a puddle of blood forming under me in the black gunk. The blood was falling like rain from my waist. I looked to my side to see my lower half being held by the ankles, blood dripping from it as well. It bursted into laughter like it had just pranked me. I screamed and cried but it just laughed louder. It walked towards the windows still laughing as it threw both pieces of me out like trash. As I fell deeper into the darkness all I could hear was its laugh. I began to wonder if I was trapped in a bad dream like in a movie. I closed my eyes ready to rest in the void once more. But this time all I felt was dread as small hands clawed at me. They dragged me further into the void, scratching small chunks of flesh off me as they lost their grip. I tried to scream but no sound came out. The voices of children giggled as tried, and the small hands started feverishly ripping me apart. They broke my fingers and toes before twisting and pulling them off one by one. They counted to 20 as they did it, speaking in unison. \n\n\"Ooone.... Twoooo.... Threee.\"\n\nThey sounded like something was immitating childrens voices.\n\n\"Eeeleven..... Tweeelve..... Thirteeen.\"\n\nI could feel less of my body, but the pain just grew more intense. I could even feel my legs as they were torn apart. \n\n\"Eighteeeen..... Nineteeeeen..... TWENTY!!!\"\n\nThe voice was now distorted and creepily excited. I couldn't feel the pain anymore, all I felt was fear that I'd wake up again."},"289":{"title":"4 Minutes With Creation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fn2e2u\/4_minutes_with_creation\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Southern-Sell3935","selftext":"**Minute Zero**\n\nWilliam sat up with a gasp.

Nearly thirty, and more than a little overweight, with short unruly brown hair left him a less than perfect physical specimen. \n\nThe air was unnaturally still without even the hint of a breeze and slightly chilly. “*Where am I and how did I get here?”* he thought as he looked around. The place seemed to have no light source yet was bright enough to see. With a flash of pain so intense he gripped his head and fell to his knees as his vision blurred. \n\nFor the space of a breath he saw a bright light glare directly into his blue eyes and could almost hear voices. He could not understand them but he could hear urgency in their tones. Then as quickly as the episode struck it was gone, taking the headache with it.\n\nGrunting, William stood back to his feet, his gray sneakers crunching on dry grass. Shouting, he said, “Hello! Is anyone there?” No answer came. For the first time William noticed that there was no sound in this place. Only his breathing made any noise at all here.\n\nThe silence and strangeness of this place forced William to start walking. This place felt wrong, oppressive, and perhaps even hostile though he could not have said why. Picking a direction at random, as every direction seemed the same he set off at a slow, limping pace. It seemed that while the headache was gone, the pain in his right leg, a permanent companion since a combat injury a decade ago, still remained. \n\nWilliam was once a promising soldier, dedicated and skilled with a bright future that was ended by an explosive placed alongside a road in Afghanistan.  While he kept the leg and could even walk, the pain and limp had never left him in ten years and he knew never would. William walked for what felt like hours with the landscape never changing and no sun ever seeming to rise. The flat semi bright light that illuminated this plane of dead grass seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere but never brightened or dimmed. \n\nFinally he stopped as the ache in his leg forced him to take a break. In a detached way, Will noticed while his leg seemed to feel the miles he walked, he was not tired. “*I haven’t felt hungry, tired, thirsty, or even the need to piss. What the hell is going on?”*  he thought. \n\nHe sat again in the grass and tried to think back to how he arrived…wherever he was. “*What is the last thing I remember? I remember waking up to my alarm going off…”*\n\nSquawking from his phone woke William from his hangover as he slapped around the nightstand trying to hit the off button. His mouth felt as dry as a desert and dragged him fully from sleep. He stood from his bed in the cramped room of his apartment and stumbled down the short hall to the bathroom. Cupping his hands, he drank straight from the faucet and splashed his face with a handful of water. The man looking back at him from the mirror looked haggard and disappointed. At 28 he had always assumed he would be an NCO with a wife and children, happy and serving his country. \n\nInstead he was fat, prematurely aging, and lived alone in a cramped apartment. The only bright spot in the crappy place was his 2 year old feline companion, Molly who made herself known by rubbing his legs as she entered the bathroom. “Hi girl,” Will muttered as he rubbed her back, while turning on the shower. He tried to shake off the worst of the hangover from last night as he entered the shower and felt the warm water flowing over him. \n\nA breakfast of redbull and cigarettes followed the shower, and a quick goodbye to his furry companion before he was out the door. William walked down the flight of stairs to his old beat up pickup. The aged black truck, more dents than original body panels, sputtered to life and he pulled out onto the road. The gas station he worked at was only a few minutes down the road from his apartment and he filled the time driving there hating his life. This was a daily occurrence for Will. The gas station was a crap job but the college kid who was his boss would never fire William for showing up to work a few minutes late like usual. The pay was terrible  but just enough to cover his expenses with some left over for whiskey and weed. Eight hours later, Will headed home, a fresh fifth of jim beam in the console of the truck, and a joint tucked into a pocket of his jeans. \n\nThe memory left William and again he was sitting in the grass of the flat plane. “*I don’t remember what happened next. I got home and then…what?*” he thought. Finally a sound crossed the grassland around him. A horrid, inhuman squeal , high pitched and filled with pain seemed to come from behind him. William did not know why but he felt certain he did not want to find what made that sound. \n\nHe again rose to his feet and began limping in what he thought was the direction he had been headed before he stopped. With no landmarks it was hard to keep direction stable in his mind. He limped along as fast as his busted leg would let him for an unknown amount of time when he saw a vague outline in the distance, slightly to the side of his current direction.\n\nAdjusting course he approached what he realized was a crop of pine trees. The feeling of danger behind him had not gotten any closer but it seemed to be keeping pace with him, pushing him forward. The trees were as dead as the grass, needles hanging brown and limp from the tall branches. The dead tree forest was much larger than it had originally seemed as he approached. \n\nThe danger from behind seemed to fall back a bit when he entered the trees and William ducked behind a large, broken stump. He examined the direction he had come but saw nothing behind him. He still felt that something lay in that direction that wanted to hurt him though he did not know why. \n\nSuddenly he realized he had never checked his pockets for his phone and patting himself he discovered his pockets empty. No phone, wallet or keys. He never went anywhere without all three and found it particularly odd that he would be somewhere without any of them. \n\nAs he was leaning against the broken stump, a faint smell tickled his nose. Woods smoke like a campfire or barbeque. Following his nose he passed farther into the dead trees until he lost sight of the grass plain and only the trees and a carpet of pine needles surrounded him. \n\nAfter a few minutes of following the smoke, the smell growing stronger, he spied a point of flickering light, brighter than the strange constant low light of this place. Finally coming to a clearing, William limped out of the trees to a pleasantly flickering campfire next to a downed tree. After what felt like nearly an entire day of wandering this strange place Will saw an old man sitting on the log looking into the dancing flames.\n\nAs William entered the clearing the man, looking somewhere in his late sixties, with unruly gray hair and an even more unruly gray beard, looked up at him. The man was wearing cargo shorts, boots, and a sweatshirt, seeming for all the world to be out on a pleasant hike.\n\nThe man smiled kindly, offset by his eyes which were crimson and seemed to glow slightly. The man said, “Finally got here? I have been waiting for a while now. Come have a seat and get the chill out.” The man's voice seemed to slam into William’s perception with a confusing maelstrom of sound. The voice contained birdsong, a thunderstorm and a million other sounds great and small. William felt deep in his core that this thing in front of him was neither a man nor a friend but it was not a threat either. This thing sitting on the bench was not the danger he had felt since arriving in this strange place.\n\nWilliam’s leg was practically screaming for a rest so with unease he sat to the left side of the man near the fire and felt a measure of relief rush through him as the warmth cut through the constant low chill of this place. The man stared in silence at William for a moment before asking “Do you like this place?”\n\n**Minute One**\n\n“Do you like this place?” William shuddered at the strange power of the red eyed man's voice. Feeling compelled to answer, Will said, “I don't even know where this place is. What is this place? How did I get here and why am I here? This place is obviously not earth, there is no sun here and nowhere on earth is this quiet or empty.” William said all of this in a rush, hoping to finally get some answers from whatever this thing sitting in front of him was.\n\nThe old man looked slightly confused and said, “You do know what this place is, and why you are here. As for where, I suppose you could say this place is between.” The man said this with a strange finality that William found himself believing completely. While he did not know why, William felt certain that this man was telling the truth. In the same way William knew water was wet, he knew this man would not lie. Like this man was somehow antithetical to the concept of a lie. Truth incarnate, inescapable and undebatable. The man's words simply were as gravity simply was. A function of reality that could not be denied. \n\nThis understanding seemed to war in William’s mind as he was sure he did not know where he was or how he had arrived. As these thoughts were crossing his scattered mind, another spike of blinding pain slammed through his skull. As before, William seemed to see through eyes elsewhere. Colors blurred across his sight, white shapes, bright multi colored lights and a strange shrill tone wailed just loud enough for him to hear. \n\nThe ache passed and again he was sitting on the log, the red eyed man, who was not a man, looking at him, apparently still waiting for an answer. The man smiled gently and asked again in his strange voice, “Do you like this place?” William glowered and said “No. This place feels…wrong. Dead and empty.” \n\nThe man nodded sagely and said, “It did not used to be like this. It used to be bright, full of life and vigor. It was allowed to become as it is now. It is so sad to see a once beautiful place so ugly.” William was quiet a moment before he asked, “Who are you?”\n\nThe old man simply replied, “Creation.” William felt the truth in that one word. A creeping fear seeped into Will as he asked softly, “Am I dead?” “No,” Creation responded. “Am I in a coma?” Will asked. “No,” Creation again said. “*Real helpful this guy*” thought William. \n\nCreation looked into William’s eyes and seeming to read his thoughts said, “You were given life were you not? What more help do you feel you are owed? Were you not given the same world as everyone else?” William rocked back at those words but his train of thought was interrupted by a howl of pain and possibly anger coming from the trees behind him. The feeling of danger returned to him. A shiver ran down his spine at the sound and the warmth of the campfire seemed to fade slightly. William turned to Creation and asked, “What is that sound? What is out there?” \n\nCreation finally moved as he stood, slightly taller than William, who had also jumped to his feet. Creation looked to the trees behind them and responded, “It is a thing of hate, bitter and full of resentment. It destroyed this place. Corrupted it into the dead emptiness you see around you.” Turning back to face Will the old man continued, “It wants to kill you. It hates you more than anything else in existence.” \n\nWill felt a splash of cold fear wash through him at this revelation and said, “Why does it hate me? Why am I here and where the fuck even is here?!” By the end, he was shouting as he demanded answers of the being called Creation. \n\nCreation started walking away from their log and the fire, further into the trees as he calmly replied, “I do not understand why it hates you. You, however, do know why it hates you. You also know where you are, you have always been here. You could not ever be anywhere else. You will be here for as long as you live.”\n\nWill followed Creation away from the fire, not wishing to face whatever lay behind him alone. William had once been a brave soldier but the thing behind him, whatever it was, scared him far more than anything he had ever experienced in his life. The two walked swiftly into the trees away from the distant howls as William asked Creation, “How do I get back home?” \n\nCreation was silent for a time as they walked but eventually he said, “You have always been here.” William stumbled over a branch and cursed venomously under his breath. Growling back at Creation he said, “If I have always been here why do I not recognize it? Where is my apartment? Where is my cat? Where is the sun?” \n\nCreation seemed disappointed with Will’s lack of understanding and said simply, “They are where they have always been. Nothing has changed. Your cat is sleeping in the windowsill of your apartment kitchen right now. Your home is still in the same building it has been in since you rented it.”\n\nWilliam glowered at the being and walked through the dead forest in silence for a time confused and angry at Creation’s lack of explanation. Just when his leg again began to slow him William finally snapped, “Why are you here? If you won’t explain where I am will you at least tell me that?”\n\nCreation came to a stop and turned to face William. The old man smiled and said, “I am here to show you the story of this place. What it was before the creature of bitterness appeared here.” William staggered to a tree and leaned against its trunk as he rubbed his damaged right leg. With an annoyed chuckle he said, “You are really bad at giving an answer to questions, you know that?”\n\nCreation cocked his head and said, “I answer truthfully, you simply refuse to understand.” Shaking his head with a sigh of disappointment, Creation conceded, “I will show you if you still cannot understand.” Creation gently grabbed William by his shoulder with a wrinkled hand. With a dizzying flash of light and color William found himself standing in a city. The first buildings he had seen in this place. Startled Will realized he knew this place. His hometown as he remembered it as a child. The world seemed brighter and to his surprise the plants were green and vibrant. Flowers bloomed and trees held their leaves and needles toward a noonday sun. \n\nCreation watched William turn a full circle with a look of astonishment. William went to ask Creation what happened but the being was gone. From the place he had stood last his voice seemed to linger saying, “See what you need to, then I will return.” Confused but fascinated by the change William set off toward the outskirts of his hometown. Perhaps he could find someone to help him there. Maybe Creation, whatever he was, had finally taken him back to reality.\n\n**Minute 2**\n\nWilliam walked toward the town across a now green meadow of grass and scattered trees. As he walked William realized with a smile that for the first time in years, his leg did not pain him. He gingerly stepped harder on his right leg and when it did not ache he began to jog then run and finally sprint into town. Smiling brighter than he had in longer than he cared to remember he came barreling into town arriving on the street he grew up on.\n\nThe houses were exactly as he remembered them with cars parked in the driveways and the familiar peaceful scent of home riding the air. There were no people however, no traffic and no one walking down the sidewalk. Confused and disappointed as this was clearly not reality, William decided to approach his oldest childhood home. The same white walls and green window shutters stood before him from his memory. The old van he had not seen in nearly twenty years in the driveway.\n\nDeciding to enter and figuring this was some sort of vision from Creation, Will did not bother knocking but tried the knob on the front door. The door clicked open and Will walked inside. A sea of memories seemed to swim before his eyes as he stood in the entryway of the house. His family was always a complicated subject for Will. As an adult he had slowly come to resent nearly every member of his family with the sole exception of his mother. \n\nWill’s father always seemed disappointed in his children, never feeling they quite added up in his eyes. Williams’s sisters were always flitting from one thing to another making foolish choices and always expecting Will to support them and clean up after their choices inevitably led to a mess. His brother was a different story though. Will had always gotten along well with his brother, his first true friend, but after they grew Will had made some bad choices of his own. His brother ended up screwed by one of Will’s bad choices and now they did not speak.\n\nWilliam felt truly awful about how he had hurt his brother but he was too much of a coward to face him and had allowed years to pass without speaking to him. His brother had married and even had children in those years yet Will had never met them. Only his mother spoke with William these days as he had cut himself off from the others.\n\nStanding in this house though he felt like he was a child again, only six or seven playing legos with his brother while mom cooked dinner and dad tinkered in the garage on some project or other. A feeling of nostalgia and loss passed through him. How long had it been since he felt like he was truly home? How long since he felt like he still had a family?\n\nHe pressed on farther into the house and to his surprise saw his whole family, including his younger self sitting in the dining room eating dinner together and speaking about their days with ease. He stood in the entry to the dining room and watched silently as the whole family interacted with the simple beauty of an everyday moment. There was nothing special about this dinner, it was one of a thousand others they had shared, but to 28 year old William it was something he had missed for years without even realizing.\n\nWhen the family finished eating the scene seemed to fade away to an empty room except for the younger version of himself. Young Will stood up from the table and looked his older self in the eyes and said, “Why did you turn me into what you are? When did we become so bitter and so mean?”\n\nThe world flashed bright and when the light cleared Will was in the backyard, watching his family play in the pool. His siblings laughed with young Will, splashing around while his mother sat reading a book, and his father grilled burgers. Young Will spotted his father and with a smirk shouted, “Heads up,” and threw a sopping wet ball from the pool at his fathers head.\n\nWill’s father turned with a chuckle as the ball smacked into the back of his head and jumped into the pool, tackling young Will into the water. The scene again dissipated leaving only young Will. He turned to his older self and said “We did not always feel so empty or so alone. When did we start accepting that we were alone? When did we choose to forget that there were good times and only remember the bad? Dad was unfair sometimes. Our siblings were thoughtless sometimes but so were we. Does that mean we have to forget that they were also our first friends? Our first family? Do you like living like that?”\n\nWilliam felt tears sliding unbidden down his cheeks as he walked away from his old house. Somewhere along he had stopped remembering all the years of fun, love and joy in the house and focused only on the worst parts of his family. He wanted others to see him for more than the fat, bitter man he had become but refused to do the same for his own family. When had that happened? \n\nFor what felt like hours William wandered his old town, viewing memories from his friends and family all somehow forgotten in a haze of disappointment and bitterness. Yes life had not turned out how he wanted but how much of that would be different if he simply focused on different things. If he had focused on all the fun with his dad would he have not had that final huge argument that led to them ignoring each other for years now? If he had remembered all the little things, a thousand small moments, with his sisters, would he have found more patience for their bad moments? When William enlisted at 18 he cut off everyone from his home and swore he was going to start a better life but instead he found himself alone and worse, he did it to himself.\n\nAs he left the last of his childhood friend’s houses Creation was standing on the front porch waiting for him. William looked at the man with a soft smile and said, “Thank you for showing me this. I had forgotten.” Creation nodded and said, “You did not always live alone. Now you have hidden from life so long you no longer remember that you want people around much less how to reach out to them.”\n\nWill looked over his old streets and asked, “Why did you show me this? What does this have to do with why I am here?” Creation seemed to ignore the question and said, “Do you like this place?” William, slightly annoyed at being ignored replied flippantly, “Of course I like it here but here isn't real. This place is what, a memory? It is gone.”\n\nCreation nodded and said, “Yes it is gone.” With a gesture from the man who was not a man, time seemed to pass over the town rapidly and the buildings decayed, roofs collapsing, windows breaking, and cars rusting. After a few moments William found himself standing in the vast, dead grass plain again with no sun and a tarnished version of the town lay around him. The same threat from before seemed behind him, closer than before with the same unearthly howl as it bore down on him. \n\nCreation ignored the howl and asked for the fifth time since meeting Will, “Do you like it here?” William snapped at the man, “Why do you keep asking me that? No, I hate this place. It's awful, it's empty, it's ugly.” Creation nodded in agreement and again started walking across the dead grass plain with William rolling his eyes and following. As they left the town Will took one last look at the buildings and to his shock he saw something moving in the ruins. A twisted hunched humanoid creature with gray skin and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth. It made eye contact with him and howled the same terrible, rage filled sound he had heard periodically since he woke here. Will began to run.\n\n**Minute 3**\n\nWilliam started to sprint away from the creature in the ruins of his old home but his leg again ached and he could only manage a mediocre pace. Creation always seemed a few steps ahead of him no matter how fast Will moved. After a few minutes of this hobbling pace William heard a new sound in this place for a few moments he swore he heard rain and a screeching of…tires maybe. Then the raging pain, worse than ever, hit his head again and William fell screaming to the ground. \n\nAs the ground rushed up to meet him, Will saw flashes of faces in some kind of mask briefly and a harsh acrid smell. Then he hit the dead grass. When the pain passed and he stood, Will found himself in his old army uniform standing in the entry to his old barracks. His old unit buddies moving back and forth to their rooms or the parking lot for a smoke or a thousand other places bustling with the constant rush of a military base.\n\nThe sun had returned to the sky and the grass was again green and full of life. There were the sounds of one of the shooting ranges in the distance, first sergeants and soldiers chanting cadences as they ran by the building and a thousand old sounds so familiar to him. Again he found his leg did not ache as he walked out of the front door to the barracks in search of Creation but instead he passed his best friend, Jason smoking a cigarette. Jason smiled at seeing him and said, “Did you hear we will be deploying soon?” \n\nWill watched as a bit younger version of himself walked up from the parking lot and grabbed a smoke from Jason’s outstretched pack. Bumping fists other William said, “Yea I just heard from staff sergeant Morris. We finally get to do army shit instead of endless training.” The two young men smiled and chatted, dreams of heroics and adventures filling their minds. \n\nThe scene disappeared to be replaced by the two friends marching down a road side by side toward a village in the mountains of Afghanistan, other members of the unit stretched out behind them. They were exhausted, hungry, and ready for this patrol to end. William remembered this day well. He would watch a humvee at the front of the column roll over a seemingly identical patch of dirt road to all the others before it would go up in a cloud of smoke and an almighty bang.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared younger William was on the ground, shrapnel from either the humvee, or the IED, no one was ever sure, having shredded a section of his leg. The next few months flashed by in moments, the endless appointments with surgeons, physical therapists, and officers before the army would thank him for his service but ultimately kick him out. Medically discharged, unfit for continued service. \n\nWilliam watched himself begin to drink, first a few drinks, then many, then an entire bottle. His relationship with Jason would sour and Will would grow to resent his friend for simply being unharmed, a truly shitty thing to hate your friend for. He eventually moved back to his home state and live for several months off his disability until his drinking became expensive enough that he finally sought out work at the gas station.\n\nThe next few years passed in a blur of drink and depression. He rarely left the crappy little apartment to do anything but work or buy booze. He lived off gas station snacks and the weight began to pile over what had once been hard earned muscle. His cat, Molly, would show up as an abandoned kitten on his porch and William kept her. She was the only thing that made him smile anymore. \n\nWilliam blinked and found himself in the now familiar dead grass plains next to Creation. The old man was staring intently at Will. The feeling of danger and rage was so close behind them William was practically choking on the malevolence of the thing. Will turned with a limp to face the being that had been pursuing him through this strange world since his arrival. \n\nIt was human only in the vaguest sense of the word, gray skin, with a hunched shuffling posture as it snarled, circling him and Creation. It was now so close Will could have walked a few steps forward and touched it. The creature snarled out through sharp gritted teeth, “I hate you. You are alone, you are a failure, you are pathetic.” William felt he finally understood the thing that wanted him dead more than anything. He was staring at himself. At what he had become. A broken angry creature, too hurt and twisted to see anything past its own bitterness and hate.\n\nAn almighty searing pain flared across William’s head and he fell to his knees as he suddenly remembered why he was in this ugly place. He was driving home from work, rain pouring down on the road and he had decided to begin drinking before he even left the parking lot of the gas station. The bottle of Jim beam, a good bit already warming his blood, lay in the center console of his old truck. He was listening to his favorite band on spotify and in his drunken state he missed the stop sign he drove past a thousand times to and from work. \n\nWith a screech of tires and crashing metal a garbage truck slammed into the passenger side of his truck and sent it rolling down the side of the road and into a ditch. The pain passed and William sat on his knees in front of the ugly twisted creature on the dead grass. William looked at it and in a whisper said, “I don’t want to be you anymore. I want to be who I used to be.” The creature uttered a bone chilling laugh and growled out, “We don’t even remember how to be happy anymore. We are bitter, selfish and cruel.”\n\nCreation finally turned from where he stood looking at William and faced the creature of hate. He said, “William, I will ask you one more time. Do you like this place?” William looked up at Creation from where he kneeled and said, “No I do not. But I used to” William felt his head start to swim and dizziness began to creep in. \n\nThe same distant wailing sound and multi-color flashing lights from before started fading in and out. Creation smiled at Will and said, “If you do not like this place then change it. You choose whether this is a place of life and color or a place of death and emptiness. You have always lived here and always will. Make it a place worth living” \n\nWilliam now felt like his head was going to explode and was so dizzy he could no longer see the man who was not a man. The flashing lights coalesced into red, white and blue lights. Familiar lights. William realized he knew those lights. An ambulance.\n\n**Minute 4**\n\nWith a gasp and a cough William opened his eyes. He lay on a gurney being wheeled by two paramedics into the back of an ambulance. His truck was smashed in a ditch a few feet away. The driver of the garbage truck was off to the side talking to a police officer. \n\nOne of the paramedics noticed Will’s eyes opened and said with a smile, “Glad to see you. We lost you for a few minutes there but you’ll be alright now.” In the coming weeks, William would face challenges on the road to recovery. His sobriety was not an easy battle to fight but he was a soldier, something he forgot somewhere along the way. He was a warrior and he would win this fight. His family would be a long road back to being together again but for the first time in years he was ready to face them again. Life would not be easy or simple but the choice to be ugly or not was simple. The question of Creation would echo in William’s mind for the rest of his life. “Do you like this place?” The next time he saw Creation, as we all do in the end, he would be able to say, “Yes I do like this place.”\n\nAlways remember, you get to choose what world you live in. If you want to see only ugly and bitter things, there is plenty to see. If you want to see bright colorful things, there are just as many of those to see. We each of us gets to choose whether we like our worlds. If you find you do not, then you can change it until you do.

Not sure if this counts as creepy enough for the subreddit . I wanted to write it as I suddenly seemed to be able to put the last few years of recovery and therapy into words through fiction.\n\nA\/N 2 Not the best story in the world but its my story. I am not named William and my military injury was not my leg. I broke my back but the leg fit the story better. This story came to me overnight and once I started writing it just flowed.

I do not have any magical qualities of any kind but I have made many people dream of things they desire, and the desires I had put in them. I am very good at it and some people yearn to desire things and dream these two elements makes life more interesting. Some even call me the sand man and I accept that as a compliment. Some people don't believe what I can do and I prove them all the times. \n\nWhen paul came to me wanting to see my abilities. I was happy to do so and when I dipped his son into lava that was alive, it kept burning his son and then healing his son from the burns, to just burning him again. Paul's son is forever stuck inside the lava fire that is living, and paul was dreaming and desiring that his son wasn't stuck inside the living fire. At that point Paul called me the sand man as I am making him dream for his son and making him desire for his son to be out of the living fire. \n\nThen another guy came to me and he didn't believe in what I can do. I don't have any magical powers at all, but I can make people dream and desire. This other guy was called Darren, and Darren wanted to feel what it was like to dream and desire again. I took Darren's aged mother and I sent her to a creature that will turn her back into a child, because this creature scares children. So when Darren's mother gets turned into a child again, her fear would feed this creature and make it stronger. \n\n\nDarren's mother would then be kept as a child by this creature. Darren was now dreaming of his mother's safety and he was desiring for his mother to be safe. He couldn't believe at what I was able to do and he called me the sandman. I laughed and I told him that I'm no sandman but rather I just think of ways to make people dream and desire, through practical means. They think I'm the sandman because I can make them dream and desire things.

That was until I moved into an old, dilapidated home on the outskirts of town, a place semi-familiar to me because it belonged to my grandmother. She had passed away a few years prior, and when the property fell into my hands, I thought it was a chance to reconnect with my roots. Nature had reclaimed so much, the trees bending in grotesque shapes, and the creaky floorboards groaned as if carrying the weight of lost memories. I felt it was a place where I could finally rest.\n\nBut soon after I settled in, things began to unravel.\n\nIt started when I heard whispers—a low, almost melodic hum that seeped through the cracks of my mind. The voice was soft yet chilling, weaving in and out of silence like a spider spinning a web. Each time I felt a presence nearby, something cold would whisper my name. At first, I thought it was merely my imagination. Old homes creak and groan, don’t they?\n\nBut I wasn’t alone in that house. I sensed him—an entity that was neither male nor female, a presence that seemed to emerge from the very shadows themselves. I saw glimpses of him at the corner of my eye, a shifting mass that melted into the walls. At times, his form appeared less human and more a reflection of something sinister, something ancient. There was a smell too—something rancid that stung my nostrils, something that felt like decay.\n\nThe first time he made himself known was on a night thick with fog. I was lying in bed, confronting the sense of dread that had pooled in my gut for weeks now. Suddenly, I woke to find the air around me suffocatingly heavy, the room darkened, but a singular light flickered—a dull glow from the corner of the room. It was in that sickly light that I first saw him, standing unnaturally still, his figure hunched as if willingly hiding within the shadows.\n\nMy breath caught, and I could barely muster a whisper, but he just stood there, blank eyes boring into me like hollow tunnels. Time slipped away; seconds felt like hours. I don’t know what compelled me, but I reached for my lamp to turn it on, and just as I did, he vanished, leaving behind a whisper that echoed in my mind, “Stay with me.”\n\nFrom that night onward, sleep became a distant memory. He’d appear more frequently, merging with the rising shadows, whispering secrets and tales that twisted my psyche. He was charming and disconcerting. With every encounter, he drew me closer to madness. I’d find myself speaking back, an involuntary dialogue blooming in the void. “Who are you?” I would ask, my voice trembling.\n\n“You know me,” he would reply. “We’re one and the same. I’m everywhere, but in you, I’m home.”\n\nWith each passing night, I began to lose track of time, of days passing, and the outside world faded. I couldn’t remember the color of the sky or the sound of children playing. I hardly remembered my own name. The whispers grew more compelling, more convincing. I felt as if I was sinking into a tar pit, drawn ever deeper. Friends would call, but the calls went unanswered, their voices lost in the suffocating presence of him.\n\nThen there was the other one.\n\nAt first, I thought he was a figment of the same madness—a dark reflection of the original. As days dwindled, I learned they weren’t mere overlapping shadows. He was different—far darker, with eyes that glinted with cruel knowledge. He fed on fear, blossoming in shadows like a carnivorous plant. He delighted in my terror, left unrelenting marks on my sanity, and pushed me deeper into despair. Whenever he appeared, it felt more substantial, more real, like a solid punishment.\n\nI realized they were two entities, separate yet woven together in a grotesque harmony. One pulled me into familiar oblivion, the other clawed at me with ravenous hunger. In this eldritch duet, I was trapped.\n\nHe fed off my fear while the other whispered promises of eternal darkness, and I became accustomed to their dance, a marionette strung along by despair. I could feel him trying to find me, could sense his twisted desire to claim me entirely.\n\nAnd then it hit me—the truly horrifying truth: I was not merely a captive. I was bait.\n\n“Stay with me,” he would say, in a softer tone, as if lulling me into a dream. But when the other one rose, the air would grow dry, cruel laughter echoing in my mind, mocking my helplessness. They were hunters and I was their prey, entrapped within a circus of horrors, tugged and twisted at their will.\n\nI grew aware that they were out for more than just me—there were others. Drawn by the fear they fed upon, they lurked in the shadows, waiting, extending their reach. They would race against each other to find the next host, the next vessel of terror.\n\nI write this, my sanity waning, hoping to warn anyone who dares to read these words. If you hear whispers curling around your mind, if you feel a cold breath creeping on your neck, know that you are not alone. You are being observed.\n\nAnd that curiosity you feel, that itch to explore—resist it.\n\nHe tried to find me, it will find you too."},"294":{"title":"My first trailer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fmpklg\/my_first_trailer\/","flair":"Video","author":"anthonypearson","selftext":"Please check out the trailer for a film I'm still working on called \"The Curse Of The Twilight Ballrooms\" - [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/animation\/comments\/1flywnn\/my\\_first\\_trailer\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/animation\/comments\/1flywnn\/my_first_trailer\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) - I'm trying for old school creepy - interested to hear comments bad or good"},"295":{"title":"I'm looking for an old poképasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fmrzre\/im_looking_for_an_old_poképasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"TRIPP-MUST-DIE","selftext":" Hope this is ok to post here I figured it would be the most likely place for someone to know what I'm on about \n\nI remember the whole thing was in the game universe blue has a Charmeleon and it starts by him taking about how the police found a dead pidgey and then he revealed it was actually him and he always got away with it then he starts ranting about how red is the worst and he ends up impulsively killing red and hiding the body in the house so his little sister wouldn't see it then he buried the body in the back yard at night \n\nIt just popped into my head and I wanted to check it was as bad as I remember but I can't find It I did try and look it up but I only found strangled red or blue tears but those are both from the pov of a player \nI definitely heard it on YouTube maybe some ordinary gamers, mah dry bread, Mr creepypasta or creepsmcpasta but It could have been someone else\nAnyone recognise this one?"},"296":{"title":"The Mark of Laugher","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fmixm0\/the_mark_of_laugher\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"ArthurBlox_","selftext":"[Story](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/19_3Jeq-1-6bkKnXkMtK-_4Mx_z0KfbAk3HHr9T3kMAs\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHey guys, I've wrote a little story of paranormal horror and I really hope you all enjoy it."},"297":{"title":"Why I'll Never Go to a Waterpark Again! – My Terrifying Animated Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fmj3ha\/why_ill_never_go_to_a_waterpark_again_my\/","flair":"Video","author":"Sudden-Zombie9098","selftext":"Ever wondered what happens when a fun day at a waterpark turns into a **nightmare**? [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LxGwtrmzzkE](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LxGwtrmzzkE) Watch this **terrifying animated story** to find out why I’ll never visit a waterpark again!

Story","author":"Collective1985","selftext":"\nIn the shadowy depths of a bygone era, where the swampy embrace of Texas and Louisiana intertwine, there lay an island shrouded in the gloom of ancient cypress trees and the whispers of the restless dead there was the infamous Houghlin Island, a place where the very earth held its breath and the moon cast a pallid light upon the waters that surrounded it. \n\nHere, in a time lost to the annals of history, the Glatcher family once reigned as lords of the land, a lineage of proud and esteemed landowners whose lineage was as unblemished as the gleaming swords and powerful muskets of their ancestral lineage was a peculiar and solitary breed, a Northern European family who were wealthy and decided to try their look by living in the bayous for generations that placed the sanctity of their bloodline above all else interacting with Cajuns, Spaniards, Creoles, and Native Americans. \n\nTheir seclusion from the ever-changing tides of the world outside had led them to embrace a disturbing tradition of intermarriage, a secret so dark it was seldom spoken of, even in the faintest of whispers isolation grew into a twisted obsession, a cocoon of madness that spun their hearts and minds into a tangled web of deformity and depravity.\n\nThe 19th century had brought with it a tumult of change and despair, and it was during this era that the very fabric of the Glatcher family \nand their existence began to unravel during one fateful evening, as the full moon painted the swamp in a ghastly pallor, the earth beneath their majestic mansion trembled with a hunger that could only be sated by the sins of the damned and a roar that could be heard for miles, the ground split asunder, swallowing the opulent manor and its inhabitants into the abyssal maw of the bayou.\n\nBut the Glatchers would not succumb so easily to the cold embrace of the earth and emerged from the murky waters, transformed by their ordeal into beings of pure terror as their skin had taken on the sickly hue of the swamp, their eyes gleaming with the feral cunning of the creatures that dwelt in its depths and the very essence of their humanity had been stripped away, leaving only a ravenous craving that could never be satisfied.\n\nWith the tenacity of the damned, they constructed a new abode from the wreckage of their former lives, a floating edifice of decayed wood and sunken earth, bound together by the very bones of the graveyards found on the island including corpses to rebuild their mansion with the foundation being anything they could find from the swamp like mud, clay, stone, and wood once again becoming a beacon of terror, a testament to their refusal to be forgotten by the world that had abandoned them.\n\nAs the years grew into decades, the Glatcher family plunged into madness deepened as they were off from the sustenance that fed them and when farming failed and the land no longer provided, they turned to the darkest of human practices, cannibalism as each moon brought forth a new round of horrors, as they stalked the swamp, preying upon the unsuspecting travelers who ventured too close to the haunted shores of their domain and their former prestigious name became a curse, a whisper of dread that sent shivers down the spines of those who dared to speak it.\n\nThe legend of the Glatchers grew, a chilling folktale that echoed through the swamp's dense tapestry of moss, and vines, and the very trees seemed to lean away from the accursed island, as if in silent protest of the abomination that dwelt within, and yet the mansion remained untouched by the ravages of time, floating serenely on the stagnant water, a grim reminder and relic of the past that had been buried but never truly forgotten.\n\nIn the later years, whispers grew into a cacophony that could no longer be ignored, and the townsfolk gathered their courage to confront the horror that lay in wait as one moonlit night, a group of brave souls set forth, their hearts pounding in unison with the distant drums of fate and approached the floating mansion of blood and death with torches in hand, their lights casting a dance of shadows upon the water's surface.\n\nThe mansion loomed before them, a towering specter of decay and despair, seemingly alive with malicious intent as the air grew thick with the stench of death and the cries of the forsaken and watched in horror as the shadows within the mansion's windows twisted and contorted into the forms of the lost souls that had suffered within its walls.\n\nThen the townsfolk, fueled by terror and righteous anger, set the mansion ablaze, the flames licking the night sky like the tongue of a fiery beast yet, as if by the cruel whims of the gods themselves, the clouds opened up in a torrential downpour that quenched the fiery wrath and left the mansion standing, a grim sentinel scarred but not vanquished by the fire.\n\nAs the fires were put out the real horrors of the Glatcher family were revealed, and the mansion became a forbidden place, erased from the maps of the living and spoken of only in the hushed whispers of the bravest of souls around the flickering embers of campfires and candlelit taverns.\n\nYet the tale of the Glatchers does not end there for on the quietest of nights when the moon is full and the fog is thick enough to slice with a knife, it is said that the mansion of bones still rises from the murky waters, a specter of the past that refuses to die the Glatcher Mansion still standing today under one condition, that the travelers who dare to venture into the swamp keep their distance and respect the area and terrain because no one knows exactly where the mansion is today.\n\nThe maps of the bayou have been redrawn, the swamp itself seemingly shifting to keep the horrors of Houghlin Island hidden from the eyes of the curious, yet the whispers persist of twisted figures that skulk in the shadows, their eyes gleaming with a hunger that can never be satiated.\n\nAnd so, the legend of Houghlin Island lives on, a grim folktale that weaves through the fabric of the swamp, a reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, of the primal instincts that lurk just beneath the surface, waiting for the moment when the veneer of civilization is at its thinnest and the consequences of meddling with the natural order are laid bare.\n\nThere are so many more legends about the Glatcher family for another time, but for now, let us leave the whispers of the swamp to those who dare to listen, and remember the grim lesson of Houghlin Island, where pride and isolation spun a web of madness that still echoes through the murky waters."},"303":{"title":"The Bean Jar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1flqof4\/the_bean_jar\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Erutious","selftext":"Dad was always kind of a weird guy.\n\nWeird and strict.\n\nI always thought this was just because he was a single parent, but even that seemed to only barely cover his odd behavior. He expected the best of me, expected my chores to be done, expected the rules to be followed, and, if I didn't, there was only one punishment that would do. \n\nDad never hit me with a belt, he never spanked me with his hand, he never took my stuff or put me in time out.\n\nNo, Dad had a different sort of punishment he used.\n\nHe didn't introduce the jar until I was six, and it was revealed with a lot of serious contemplation.\n\nI remember coming home from my first day of Kindergarten and finding my Dad sitting in the living room, the jar on the little end table where the magazines and rick rack usually stood. The jar may have begun life as a pickle jar, it always smelled a little of brine, and inside were beans. These were spotted pinto beans, the kind I had used on art projects and crafts since before I could remember, and I noticed they had been filled up to the brim. All in all, there were probably about three bags of beans in there, and a piece of scotch tape declared it to be my jar.\n\n\"Take a seat, we need to have a very serious talk,\" he said, and I ended up just sitting on the floor of our living room and looking up at him. He looked very serious, more serious than I had ever seen him before, and that scared me a bit. Up until now, Dad had always been this goofy guy who played pirates and astronauts and Mario Kart with me, but now he looked like a judge ready to sentence me to death if I didn't have a pretty good defense for my crime.\n\n\"You are six now, long past knowing right from wrong. In this family, it is customary to use The Bean Jar to punish children. Do you see this jar?\" he asked like there was any way I could miss it.\n\nI nodded and he smiled, seeming pleased.\n\n\"The Bean Jar symbolizes You. It is everything you are, and everything you might be. So, from now on, when you are bad, or insolent, or you disobey my orders, I will not yell at you or send you to your room. I won’t do anything but take a bean from The Bean Jar.\"\n\nI almost laughed. Was this a game or something? Was I supposed to be scared of a jar of beans? This had to be another one of Dad's jokes. Dad was always doing stuff like this, telling me how the monsters in my closet could be kept away by a teddy bear or that the Cavity Creeps would eat my teeth if I didn't brush them twice a day. Dad was a goofball, he always had been, but I think it was his face that made me wonder if he was joking or not. Throughout the whole thing, he just sat there, deadly serious, and never averted his eyes from me.\n\n\"You're a smart kid, just like I was, and I see now that you'll need an example. You may think this is just a regular jar, but you're wrong,\" he said, reaching in and picking up a bean, \"dead wrong.\"\n\nHe didn't even take it out. He just lifted a little, hovering it over the pile, but he didn't need to do anything else. Suddenly, miraculously, it felt like someone was touching my brain. It was the feeling of getting a sudden sadness, a sudden bit of anxiety, and I wanted him to drop that bean back in the jar. I needed to be whole, I needed all my beans, and he must have seen that on my face because he dropped it back in and I trembled as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you have to know what's at stake here. You're my last chance, I have to make sure that you are perfect, and the Bean Jar knows perfection from flaw. My own father used this method, and his father, and his father before him. The Bean Jar is always used until the child's eighteenth birthday, or until all the beans are gone.\"\n\nI was panting when I asked him what would happen if all the beans were gone.\n\nHe looked at me without mirth and without any sign of a joke or a goof, \"You don't want to know.\"\n\nThat's how we started with the Bean Jar. Dad didn't suddenly turn into an ogre or become a villain overnight. He went back to being the same guy he'd always been. We would play video games together, build with my Legos, and play pretend after school. My Dad had never scared me like that before, he and I were always really close, but I remember how he would get when he had to take beans out of the jar. His face would become completely neutral, and he would walk to the jar and take out a bean before crushing it between his thumb and forefinger. \n\nThe Bean Jar was utilized even for the most trivial of infractions. \n\nForgot to wash my dishes? Lose a bean.\n\nForgot to put my clothes away? Lose a bean.\n\nStayed up too late on a school night? Lose a bean.\n\nThere was no escalation either. There was never any difference between forgetting to clean up my toys or yelling at Dad because I was frustrated. It was always one bean at a time, ground to dust between his large, calloused fingers. He would look at me too with this mixture of pain and resolve once it was done, his stoicism only going so far.\n\nThose times he took a bean, however, were unbearable. \n\nIt felt as if each bean were a piece of my psyche that he was turning to dust. As a child, every bean made me hyper-aware of my actions, but I was still just a child. Sometimes I forgot things, sometimes I was lazy, and sometimes I thought I could sneak around and get away with not doing what I was told. I was always caught, always punished, and I always fell into a state of anxious, nervous emotions once it was done. I hated the way it felt when he crushed those beans, and I didn't want to lose another one. I didn't want to lose them so badly, that I trained myself to perform the tasks expected of me without fail. Five am: start the laundry. Five twenty: make breakfast. Five Thirty: wash my dishes. Five forty: dress. Six o'clock: clean up my room. Six thirty: backpack on, fully dressed, waiting by the door to leave. Three ten: Get home, do homework. Four thirty: Clean house. Five: Start dinner. Six: Eat dinner when my father got home. Nine o'clock: brush teeth, take a shower. Ninethirty: Bedtime. Every day, without fail, these things were done or I would be one bean shorter.\n\nThis manifested itself as a kind of mania in me. Not only did I have to get all my chores done, but I needed to get good grades too. After a while, good wasn't good enough either. What if Dad decided that C's and B's weren't good enough? I strove for all A's, and Dad seemed happy with my efforts.\n\nTo the other kids, however, I was a weirdo, and I didn't really have any friends.\n\nDad was my only friend, but it was a strange kind of friendship.\n\nLike living with someone who has schizophrenia and could change at the slightest inclination.\n\nI didn't have any real friends until high school when I met Cass.\n\nCassandra Biggly was not what you would consider a model student. Her parents had high expectations for her, but she was a middling at best. She came to me because I was the smartest kid in school, at least according to the other kids, and she begged me to help her. I helped her, tutored her, showed her the way, and soon her grades improved. That was how we became friends, and how she was the first to find out about the Bean Jar.\n\n\"So, he just takes a bean out and crushes it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, not sounding at all mystified about the process.\n\n\"And...what? It means you have less beans?\"\n\nI thought about it, Dad had never actually told me what would happen, only that it would be terrible.\n\n\"When he takes out all the beans, then something awful will happen.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Cass asked, \"No dessert for a month?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I know that when he crushes those beans, it's like a piece of my sanity is mushed. I feel crazy after he smooshes a bean. I don't like feeling that way, I don't like it at all.\"\n\nI started crying. I hadn't meant to, I was sixteen and I never cried anymore, but Cass didn't make me feel bad about it. She just held me while I cried and eventually, I stopped. It had felt good to be held. Dad hugged me, but he never really comforted me. I didn't have a mom, someone whose job seemed to be comforting me, and as Cass held me, I realized what I had been missing all these years.\n\nI had been missing a Mom that I had never even known.\n\nWe hung out a lot after that, Cass and I. Despite our age, it never became inappropriate. She gave me something I had been missing, a friend without the threat of punishment looming over our relationship. The realization made me feel differently about my Dad. He was still the lovable goofball that he had always been, but I started to see how our entire relationship hung under the shadow of that bean jar. As I pulled away, he became more sullen, and more suspicious, and I saw him holding the Bean Jar sometimes as if he wished to smash them. If I wasn't misbehaving, though, he couldn't, that was always the deal. He knew it, I knew it, and he knew that as long as I abided by the rules, he couldn't punish me. \n\nDespite how it will sound, Dad was never cruel about the Bean Jar. He never used it to take out his frustrations, he never came home and punished me simply because he’d had a bad day. The rules were established, we had both agreed to them, and I knew that by following them I would be safe. I think, deep down, Dad really did think he was doing the best for me, thought he was molding me into something better than I could be, and I guess he was right, though it wasn’t fair, not really. \n\nThen, one day after coming home from Cass's, it all came to a head.\n\nDad was supposed to be at work, so Cass and I came back to the house to play video games. She had never even seen a Super Nintendo, and she wanted to play some Mario Kart with me. We had come in, laughing and making jokes, when someone cleared their throat loudly, sending a chill up my spine and turning me slowly to find my Dad sitting on the couch. He looked so much like he had the day he introduced the Bean Jar, and he was wearing that look of pain and resolve.\n\n\"You come home late, your chores aren't done, your homework is undone, and you have brought someone here without permission. Why have you decided to break the rules like this?\"\n\nI saw the hammer come down on the table, but I hadn't realized what he'd done until then. It turned the bean he had laid there to smithereens, and I shuddered as I gripped my head and moaned. If he noticed, he made no comment. He just brought the hammer down on another one, and I nearly vomited as a pain like no other went through me. He had lined up four, one for each infraction, but he had never done anything like this. It had always been one at a time, and that had been bad enough. \n\nThis, however, was unbearable.\n\n\"Stop it!\" Cass yelled, \"Whatever you're doing to him, stop,\" but he cut her off. \n\nHe grabbed her under the arm and heaved her toward the door, \"This is your fault. You've changed him, made him forget his purpose, but I won't let you kill him. You aren't allowed in this house, never again, and I,\"\n\n\"Put her down,\" I growled, finding my feet, weaving only a little, \"You will not touch her.\"\n\nMy father looked at me, not believing what he was hearing.\n\n\"Put her down, now,\" I repeated, stepping up close and getting in his face.\n\n\"You dare? You dare to challenge me? You're no different than the rest. I tried to raise you better, but it appears I was a fool. I'll smash every damn bean in that jar if I have to. When all the beans are gone, you’ll cease to exist! I’ll smash every damn bean in that jar, just to prove...just to...just to...prove,\" but he never finished. \n\nHe let go of the hammer as he clutched at his chest, and it fell from his grip as he gasped and beat at his shirt front. His face had gone from red to purple and before he hit the floor it was nearly black. I just stood there for a moment, listening to Cass beat at the door and ask what was wrong. I couldn’t answer, I just stood there, feeling like I was suffocating as the realization that my father was dead fell across me. \n\nThat was two years ago. \n\nI’ve been living with Cass since then, her parents taking me in gladly. Cass and I are getting ready for college and that’s when I remembered the house. It’s still there, still sitting on the same lot, and I decided that it might be good to sell it so I can pay tuition. There were things inside as well, I’ve been back there a few times to get things, and I knew my father’s room was essentially untouched. The police hadn’t bothered to search the place. Dad’s death was no mystery, after all, and they had decided he had died of a heart attack and saved me a lengthy interrogation. \n\nI started cleaning it out as summer began, selling what I could and donating what I couldn’t. I found pictures of my Dad and I, taken in better times, and far too soon I had cleaned out everything and was left with only my fathers room. I paused at the door, almost feeling like a burgler when I thought of going in there, but finally decided this was my house now and this room was as good as mine.\n\nThe room was spartan, a bed and a dresser and a closet, but it was what I found inside it that took me by surprise. \n\nFive jars, each of them bearing a different name.\n\nJacob, Mark, Sylvester, Katey, and James.\n\nThey were empty, the lids gone, and the taped on names made them look exactly like mine.\n\nWhat the hell was this? Who were these people? I didn’t know any of them, and no one but Dad and I had ever lived in the house. It had always been the two of us, always just…\n\nNo, that couldn’t be true, because my mother had once lived with us. \n\nThere, in the back, was a sixth jar, the glass broken but the tape intact.\n\nMaggie.\n\n“When the beans are gone,” I heard Dads voice echo in my head, “then you cease to exist.”\n\nHad the names on those jars been real people? Had I lived with them and simply didn’t remember them? How could you remember people who never existed? \n\nI sat there for a long time, trying to make sense of it all, and finally decided to write al this before it grew unclear.\n\nApparently Dad wasn’t as crazy as I might have thought, and maybe I should have been more respectful of the bean jar.\n\nIt sits on the shelf in my dorm room now.\n\nI took it from the house before I sold it and I guard it jealously. \n\nI don’t know if it still works the same now that dad is dead, but I’m not taking any chances. "},"304":{"title":"The Whispers in the walls","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1flw4zd\/the_whispers_in_the_walls\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Rilloraza2003","selftext":"In a small, forgotten town nestled deep within a dense forest, there stood an abandoned house known only as Hollow Manor. Local legends whispered of its dark past—a family that had vanished without a trace, leaving behind nothing but their possessions and an eerie silence that seemed to envelop the property. Curious teenagers often dared each other to venture inside, but few returned unscathed, their minds haunted by something they couldn’t quite articulate.One foggy autumn evening, a group of four friends—Anna, Mark, Jess, and Tom—decided to explore the manor, driven by a mix of bravado and curiosity. Armed with flashlights and a cheap video camera, they set off just as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the overgrown path.As they approached the manor, its crumbling facade loomed ominously. The front door, barely hanging on its hinges, creaked open as if inviting them in. With a shared look of trepidation, they stepped inside. The air was stale and heavy, carrying a faint scent of mildew and decay. Dust motes danced in the beams of their flashlights, illuminating faded wallpaper adorned with floral patterns long since turned to peeling remnants.\"Let’s check out the living room first,\" Mark suggested, his voice barely above a whisper. They moved cautiously, the wooden floorboards groaning beneath their weight. The living room was a graveyard of forgotten memories—tattered furniture, a shattered mirror, and photographs that had yellowed with age.As they explored, Jess stumbled upon an old journal tucked away in a drawer. Its pages were filled with the frantic scrawls of a woman named Eliza. The entries described a growing unease within the house, strange noises at night, and an overwhelming sense of being watched. The last entry sent shivers down Jess's spine: \"I hear them whispering in the walls. They want me to leave, but I can’t. I’m afraid.\"\"That’s creepy,\" Tom said, peering over her shoulder. \"Let’s get out of here.\"But Anna, the most adventurous of the group, dismissed his fears. \"We need to see more. There could be something interesting upstairs.\" Reluctantly, the others followed her lead, climbing the narrow staircase that spiraled into darkness.At the top, they found a long hallway lined with doors. Each one seemed to beckon them closer, yet an unsettling feeling settled in the pit of their stomachs. They opened the first door, revealing a child’s room frozen in time. A faded teddy bear sat on the bed, and toys were strewn across the floor. It felt too quiet, too still.Suddenly, they heard it—a faint whispering that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves. It was soft at first, like the rustling of leaves, but grew louder, forming indistinguishable words. Panic set in as they exchanged fearful glances.\"What is that?\" Anna gasped, her bravado faltering.\"Let’s get out of here!\" Mark urged, but the whispers grew more insistent, wrapping around them like tendrils. They could hear phrases like “leave now” and “you’re not welcome.”Ignoring their better judgment, they pressed on, drawn by a morbid curiosity. The next room they entered was a study, lined with bookshelves filled with dust-covered tomes. In the center sat an old desk, and upon it lay a faded photograph of the family who once lived there. The parents looked happy, but the children—two girls—seemed to be staring directly at the camera with expressions that sent chills down their spines.\"Okay, this is getting too weird,\" Tom said, his voice trembling. \"We should go.\"As they turned to leave, the whispers escalated into a cacophony, drowning out their thoughts. \"Stay with us,\" they pleaded, \"forever and ever.\" The friends froze, paralyzed by a fear they had never known. The air grew thick, almost suffocating.Without thinking, Anna bolted for the door, but it slammed shut before she could reach it. Panic erupted among them as they tried to push it open. The whispers intensified, swirling around them, demanding their attention. “You’re part of us now,” they hissed, a dark promise laced with malice.In a frantic attempt to escape, Jess remembered the journal. “The way out is through the basement!” she shouted. They hurried down the hallway, the whispers now a chaotic storm, desperately trying to drown out their escape. They reached the last door at the end of the hall, which led to a steep staircase descending into darkness.With no time to hesitate, they descended into the basement. It was cold and damp, the air thick with an oppressive gloom. At the far end of the room, they found an old door that looked as if it hadn’t been opened in years. Mark forced it open, revealing a narrow passage.“Go! Go!” he urged as the whispers began to rise again, clawing at their sanity. They squeezed through, feeling an overwhelming pull as if the house itself was trying to drag them back.Finally, they burst into the night air, tumbling onto the overgrown lawn. Gasping for breath, they looked back at the manor, which now stood silent and still, the whispers fading into the wind.“Did that really just happen?” Jess panted, still in shock.“We need to get away from this place,” Tom insisted, and they ran down the path, hearts racing.As they reached the edge of the forest, Anna glanced back one last time. For a fleeting moment, she swore she saw faces in the windows—eyes watching, pleading, waiting. The whispers had fallen silent, but the air was thick with an unshakable feeling of being followed.Days turned into weeks, but the memories of Hollow Manor lingered. They couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed within them. Sometimes, at night, they would hear faint whispers—soft, persistent, like a gentle breeze brushing against their ears, calling them back to the darkness.And every so often, Anna would find herself staring at the old photograph, wondering about the family that had once called Hollow Manor home, and the price they had paid for their silence. The house was empty, but it was far from vacant; it held secrets that were not yet ready to be uncovered. The whispers would always remain, waiting for the next curious souls to wander too close.\n\nClick here for more info: https:\/\/s.shopee.ph\/608z64zU7G"},"305":{"title":"need help making a decision for my story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1flvt3l\/need_help_making_a_decision_for_my_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"writting_for_thedead","selftext":"so, im working on creating a creepypasta oc, and i want to write her story, my main idea is that she's basically in the woods being hunted, and trying to survive, but she's caught and brutally murdered, expect when she's left (the people chasing her thinking she's dead) she's still just barley alive, and slenderman comes, yk does his little creepypasta thing, and turns her into a proxy, and she becomes like a part of the woods big sharp ass teeth, antlers, etc, and she hunts the people who are in the woods (especially people there to hunt animals).\n\nthe part i need help with deciding is why exactly she's being hunted? my two main ideas were classic stalker situation y'know? normal creepypasta stuff, my other idea was some kind of sick and twisted family ritual that she has to survive, but im also open to other ideas! so some feedback would be nice "},"306":{"title":"Creepypasta Music Playlist!!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fltj39\/creepypasta_music_playlist\/","flair":"Iconpasta Story","author":"BlackVultureFeather","selftext":"Did you love creepypasta back in the early 2010s?

I just wanted to smash windows and I guess I have serious social issues. I grew up in a rough area and now I want to burn the whole village down. I saw a group of poshly built houses and I thought to myself \"Yep I'm smashing those windows\" and I guess I am not a big fan of the rich. So I got my bat out and I wore my hoodie and I was ready to smash some windows. I've done it before and it's hilarious how cowardly people can be. \n\nWhen I smashed the first window it wasn't random crack lines, or glass breaking onto the floor. When I smashed the first window it revealed to me a map. It was the map of the area and it had arrows of where i should go. This was highly strange and I smashed another house window, and instead of random crack lines, I got another map with arrows telling me where to go. I wondered where it was leading me and I decided to follow it. I took a picture of it but when the arrows ran out, I knew I had to smash another window. \n\nSo I smashed another window and another map was drawn out of the cracks. It was incredible to see and the arrows led me further down the area, and the houses got more older and prettier. I then started going crazy and just started smashing more windows, the cracks formed more maps of other treasures and bones that weren't meant to be discovered. I couldn't find a map that would lead me further down this area. Then as I smashed another window, the area of the map came about. \n\nIt lead me down the area of a figure and the cracks lines actually made a figure. This figure had all sorts of swords nailing him to the ground. The figure spoke out to me and said \"the window smasher has found me, did you like my maps that I made the cracks to make!\" And I had no idea what it was. It could talk and it had wings and it was begging me to free it by pulling out the swords. I just walked away and I could hear it begging me to come back. \n\nNow and then I like to smash a window, and I enjoy seeing the crack lines drawing me a map to where this creature is.

We enjoyed exploring abandoned buildings, and Jake liked to record it to post on YouTube and his other social media platforms.\n\nThis time, we planned to explore a closed mall that was maybe 40 minutes away from our house. The drive there didn't take as long as we expected. As we pulled into the mall parking lot, our car rattled over potholes while we parked behind a loading dock near what used to be the food court. It provided a good hiding spot for the car behind the dumpsters.\n\nThe mall itself was a shell of what it must have been—a vast, empty husk. Napkins and garbage littered the floors, most of it stained and brittle from years of neglect. It had a creepy vibe that often made the hair on my neck stand on end.\n\nAs we walked deeper into the mall, we passed a broken escalator, its steps torn away and missing, exposing the jagged insides of the machine like some kind of mechanical carcass. We decided not to risk walking up it and instead looked for the stairs.\n\nBehind us, we heard a strange noise—a metallic scraping sound, slow and deliberate, like someone dragging a metal pipe across the floor. We stopped, exchanged a look, and listened.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" Jake whispered, his voice barely a tremor in the heavy stillness around him. He tightened his grip on the flashlight, the beam slicing through the darkness. We both thought we were here alone, but that noise wasn't something an abandoned mall made by itself.\n\nThen we heard a rough voice yell out, \"I'm going to fucking kill you both.\" We both froze, adrenaline kicking in like ice through my veins.\n\nJake and I didn’t even hesitate. We instinctively started running toward the nearest exit sign because the voice came from where we had just walked in.\n\nWe managed to find an exit, and luckily the doors were not locked. We burst through the doors. Sprinting back to the car took a while because we had walked a decent distance from the food court while inside the mall. I kept looking over my shoulder, expecting to see someone lunging at us from behind, but the man was gone.\n\nWe turned on the car, and Jake immediately started driving away. However, we noticed something else: the front tire was flat. We could feel the tire thumping as we drove.\n\nWe didn't risk taking the time to fix it near the mall. Instead, we drove to the nearest building with lots of lighting and stayed in the car for a few minutes to ensure this guy didn't somehow follow us.\n\nWe fixed the flat tire and decided we'd just call it a night. This was the only time we encountered someone else while urban exploring. Honestly, we took a few weeks off from doing it again because we were so shaken up, but now we both explore with a decent-sized hunting knife tucked in our bags."},"316":{"title":"Looking for creepypastas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fl5vau\/looking_for_creepypastas\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Legal_Conversation68","selftext":"Hi everybody!!!

It took me days to figure out the issue, but I found nothing. However, interestingly enough, my computer did find a strange .txt file that repeated \"I AM NINTENDO\" a hundred times, ending with \"Don’t Disappoint Luigi\" in the same way.\n\nAside from that, I am now sick with strep, so I had to stay home from school. However, this gives me time to type all of this out. It’s currently 7 PM, and no, this isn’t my usual bedtime; I typically go to sleep around 11. Now, I have some interesting stuff to share, so keep reading this post and stay with me.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/oiEZrWq8I7o?si=kqJ2F-rsNNHRx67S](https:\/\/youtu.be\/oiEZrWq8I7o?si=kqJ2F-rsNNHRx67S)\n\nThis time, I loaded up the game, and it immediately started outside Peach’s Castle (or, in this case, Burnt Luigi’s Castle, with me as the actual Luigi—an interesting combo, I must say). However, this time he was no longer standing in front of the castle like before. I started exploring the layout outside the castle, as I hadn’t examined it thoroughly before. I headed to the bridge on my right. The trees were all gone. So, I continued toward the castle, knowing there wasn’t much on the left.\n\nI threw some “wahs” and “wahoos” as I jumped my way there, like any Mario 64 player would. I’m one of them. When I got inside, I ran toward the door with Bob-omb Battlefield. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I haven’t really interacted with the levels—only the castle—and I feel bad about that. I think in my second post (if I remember correctly), I couldn’t share footage of Bob-omb Battlefield, and for those who think it was lazy writing, it wasn’t. OBS Studio is just garbage; it doesn’t always capture everything. I’m pretty sure I accidentally stopped the recording when I entered the level, so you didn’t see anything.\n\nWhen I entered the room, the Bob-omb Battlefield portrait was thankfully still the same. I was expecting some spooky image, like a black-and-white photo of Burnt Luigi or something worse, like a frame from a snuff film or gore site. I made my character jump out of excitement because, honestly, I didn’t feel like getting spooked. Any normal person would understand that. I entered the level, \"Big Bob-omb on the Summit.\" However, I wasn’t going to defeat King Bob-omb because, if you remember from Post #1 (when this blog was handled by my brother), he was already defeated. As of now, Burnt Luigi has made himself the leader of Bob-omb Battlefield, turning all the Bob-ombs into his slaves.\n\nThe level played out normally, but I noticed the missing trees (thank God, because I really didn’t want to see that image of Luigi again). The sky was black, and unlike the castle, the level was darker and gloomier. Also, I should note that this game is super laggy, so I apologize for that. It's the case with all ROMs on my computer, even the normal ones.\n\nI noticed the Chain Chomp was missing, along with its gate. Normally, you go there for the sixth mission, \"Behind Chain Chomp’s Gate,\" which is an easy star if you know how to ground-pound. Without the gate, I could collect the star at any time—easy win for me. However, I skipped that for now because I wanted to find a 1-up to give myself an extra life for later. I knew where one was—under the bridge at the entrance to the mountain with the rolling black balls.\n\nAs I slid under the bridge, I found something strange: the green mushroom was missing its eyes. Even though I needed it, I hesitated. No eyes on a mushroom? I was concerned about what it might do. Yes, I know mushrooms don’t normally have eyes, but given the weirdness of this copy, I didn’t want to risk it. So, I left it and went back for the star I’d passed.\n\nI collected the star and returned to the room with the portrait. Then, I headed to the courtyard to see what was happening. From what I’ve gathered, this area seems to be Burnt Luigi’s little hangout spot. Yes, I still can’t believe I’m calling him that, despite how absurd it sounds.\n\nTo those watching the footage: you’re seeing this, right? Notice how the screen pans to the fountain. There are three trees—or rather, three Burnt Luigis—on top of the fountain, like some kind of cult ritual. I checked to see if the caged Boo had returned—it hadn’t. I looked up at one of the pillars on the right and saw another Luigi staring directly at me.\n\nI’m not joking anymore; this is really creeping me out. If you listen closely in the footage, you can hear me breathing heavily in fear. I tried to move around, but when I looked back at the fountain, they were still staring at me. Standing there in horror, I turned toward the door and ran, but I heard the Endless Staircase music playing quietly in the background, layered over the castle theme. I didn’t look behind me. I don’t know why, but that music was creepy enough, and it managed to scare me even more than running up those stairs in the actual game.\n\nSeriously, the Endless Staircase music sounds like you’re being chased, and it fit this situation perfectly.\n\nI rushed back to Bob-omb Battlefield as quickly as possible. I felt safer there, despite the enemies. Even though I’d already done the sixth mission, I just wanted to do the first one to escape that castle. At this point, I was ready to grab the mushroom. I didn’t care what it might do.\n\nI slowly approached the mushroom and finally built up the courage to grab it. Then, the screen froze and went black. I watched as Burnt Luigi emerged from the shadows. I hate to say this because I know people might find it unrealistic or cliché, but Burnt Luigi had his head down. The image wasn’t compressed—it looked like 1080p. It was as if it came from that hack, “Render 96,” which has detailed specs. Burnt Luigi looked hand-drawn, not like his in-game model. He looked like the physical version from my nightmares, only slightly animated.\n\nI’m slowly coming to the conclusion that this might just be a hacked copy of *Super Mario 64.* I know that sounds silly, especially with how old this game is, but this goes beyond the N64’s capabilities. Some people might have thought I was joking in earlier posts, but now I’m serious. You can see it in the footage—I’m starting to experience what my brother did.\n\nI’m in shock at what I’m seeing. The background audio is heavy drums on repeat. It sounds like it was pulled from somewhere else but is using the game’s soundfont—or at least something close. Burnt Luigi lifted his head, and this was the first time I heard a voice outside of in-game text. It sounded like someone trying to imitate Luigi but “monster-like,” as if they were practicing Italian and doing a terrible job.\n\nHe said the following message, and I’m typing it out word-for-word:\n\n“It seems like you’ve disappointed Luigi, like I warned you not to, all this time. Now, I’m willing to give you another chance, but if you screw this one up, I’ll delete your save file again. Actually, I might keep doing that anyway because I get so much enjoyment from watching you suffer. Now, I’ll talk to you on Discord, and if you even think about messing with me, I’ll become your bogeyman—and one for your little friends on the Mario Amino community, too!”\n\nAfter that, Burnt Luigi faded into the darkness, and the game closed. Another text file appeared. If this keeps happening, I might just make a folder exclusively for Burnt Luigi’s ramblings. I hope he won’t mind. Apparently, I’m now required to talk to him on Discord. Do I want to? No. Should I block him? Probably not a good idea.\n\nI’ll see what I can do. Thankfully, he can’t read these posts—he’s both dumb and horrifying at the same time."},"319":{"title":"Where's the best place to post a creepy story and receiving feedback?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1flcsk1\/wheres_the_best_place_to_post_a_creepy_story_and\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Strange_Ebb_4565","selftext":"I'm new at writing creepy stuff, but I would like my story\/es to get read by people, should I post it here or on another sub?

The thing goes to the windows and calls out to the grandpa looking for him. Hes on the floor to keep them out of view and im pretty sure he covers the kids mouth. The thing stays around and leaves after a while. The grandpa explains it and I don’t know if it included the kid growing up and taking over care for the house. Possibly the kid needing to take over looking fter the thing that comes from the woods.\n\nI have no clue if it is a creepy pasta or a no sleep or such.

Craig went into the incubator and his liver was taken out. The incubator was keeping Craig alive and the robot put Craig's liver into its own system. The robot was using Craig's liver to test how good it is, and it was good. Then the robot wanted to test more of craigs bodily organs. Craig was glad that his liver was good and that the robot was able to use it. The testing was not to end at this minute though and now the robot was going to test Craig's kidneys. \n\nThe robot took Craig's kidneys this time and the robot put it into its own system. The robot drank many things and it could see that Craig's kidneys were in good condition. Craig was happy that his kidneys were working fine. Craig was safe inside the incubator and Craig was actually enjoying being inside the incubator. He was enjoying relaxing from the world and not worrying about stuff. It was completely painless and the robot was being good to him. Then the robot was testing out his other organs by using them. When Craig's intestines were being tested and they were in fine working order. Craig was happy. \n\nThen when majority of Craig's organs were inside the robot, Craig was still fine because the incubator was keeping him alive. Craig was really enjoying being inside the incubator and he didn't want to come out. It was a good break from the world and all was good. Then the robot tested out Craig's tongues and ears. They too were in good condition and they too were very useful. Craig was able to know that his tongue and ears were in good condition, because the robot transported the report of his tongue and ears straight to his brain. So the robot now had all of Craig's organs and tongue and ears. \n\nThe robot started testing out more of his body. Like his nose and skin, the robot actually wore his skin. Craig was not in pain though as the incubator kept him alive. Then the robot tested out Craig's reproductive system, heart, lungs, teeth and bones. They were all in good condition as the robot used all of them and also Craig's wife was now pregnant. This report went straight to Craig's brain and he was happy. \n\nTh robot started to feel in love with Craig's wife and he told Craig who was still completely useless in the incubator, and the robot took more of Craig apart from his brain. Craig smiled and the reason Craig smiled was because it will always be his child. This unnerved the robot and even though he reproduced with Craig's wife, it was still Craig's reproductive system. \n\nThe robot unalived Craig's family. The robot went to Craig who was still inside the incubator, and took his brain. Craig had now completed the body check.

Pero como todo en esta vida, una fuente de información puede ser corrompida por las malas ambiciones del ser humano y estos son dirigidos para unos fines menos apropiados para la evolución positiva del \"ser\" humano y van mas para el bando de la obtención de mas poder y dinero. Para cuando una persona de a pie se topa con este tipo de temas de conversaciones (Que no son para nada frecuentes) uno puede responder de varias maneras, entre ellas, el importarle poco o nada lo que ocurra pues su principal misión en el mundo es el de vivir o si puede el de ser popular, y luego están algunos que cuando sus mentes son estimuladas con tales charlas, se les enciende un poco las bombillas y al menos se dignan ha alzar la cabeza y preguntar: \"¿Que coño es todo esto?\". Mas que no se te olvide picha mía que, lo que te venden como una utopía distópica que nunca sucederá, como si de un cielo que para los ateos seria muy bonito pero imposible de alcanzar, una sociedad o un mundo donde la única bandera que se alzara sobre los vientos seria la de la libertad y la única lengua usada por el mundo sea la de la verdad. Claro esta que.... Estando como están las cosas, muy difícil es de que suceda. No es imposible, pero es muy difícil.\n\nEn el caso de que tu quieras bombardear con esta información a un joven de veintipocos años y con la mente aun joven y flexible, la combinación no es que sea bastante buena, pues nunca ha sido buena idea decirle a un niño con una sola cifra de edad que lo importante es querer a todos como a uno mismo (entiéndase la referencia bíblica) y a la vez decirle que todos son unos mierdas y que al final solo podrá confiar en si mismo. Este fue por desgracia el caso de Gustavo, quien con sus 24 primaveras se creyó que podía comerse al mundo con sus palabras, sus sentidos y su justicia y, al final solo se convirtió en la sombra del hombre que vendió al mundo.\n\nQuien te dijera que la universidad, escuela o el instituto es solo una parcela que representa en lo absoluto la libertad, miente: Realmente, compañero, no es nada mas que una cárcel de falsa doctrina y de moralidad. Aquel iluso que se piensa que al entrar será capaz de poner a prueba su mente para terminar siendo mas listo, sabio y espiritual, al final se encuentra con la mas horrorifica escena de profesores que en cuanto pueden te mostraran pamplinas y mentiras por todos lados para confundir y para tergiversar la verdad.\n\nAsí que ahí va el pequeño gorrión de ojos azulados como el mar y de pelo marrón como la madera de los arboles, yendo sin saber lo que le esperaba hacia aquella parcela que supuestamente era el símbolo vivo de la libertad.\n\nNingún día se hizo destacar en general por su monotonía y por su repetida forma de ser y parecer, mas había algo que decoraba un poco para bien aquella experiencia: Clubs.\n\nDe todos los clubs que había, el de poesía y letras le llamo la atención porque al menos allí tenia la oportunidad y la pequeña abertura para escribir sobre lo que le diera la gana y encima con toda la excusa, razón y sentido del mundo entero. Al fin y al cabo: La poesía transmite lo que uno siente. Así pues, Gustavo se adentro en aquel club de poesía y fue bien recibido por todos y por cada uno de sus componentes. A diferencia de muchas historias que habrás podido escuchar sobre personas hundidas por el infortunio, o espíritus y criaturas sobrenaturales que simplemente son malas por naturaleza o fueron impulsadas a serlos: Aquí nuestro pequeño poeta no recibió ninguna mala mirada nada mas llegar al lugar, eso vendría mas adelante.\n\nBajo la seguridad de que podía escribir y expresar todo lo que pensaba y sentía, comenzó a crear varias obras poéticas y escritos de todo tipo para así despejar un poco el peso que sentía en su pecho, y para su fortuna fue bastante apreciada y alabada por sus colegas.... Todos menos uno.\n\nAparentemente este sujeto era un alguien que, aunque era respetuoso y amable con las personas, tenia un perfil oculto que espantaba a las personas debido a que era muy radical en cuanto a opiniones e ideas se refiere. Cuando este sujeto vio que clase de vientos golpeaban la melena del poeta, se dirigió hacia el e intento convencerle de que borrara sus escrituras y cambiase de parecer porque, según su parecer, estaba equivocado en absolutamente todo y eso solo haría que los tópicos que el tocaba se viesen perjudicados mediante una mala imagen publica.\n\nAnte tal petición, el poeta no contuvo su risa ante tal estupidez y le comento que el pensamiento y la opinión eran unos temas tan subjetivos, generales y amplios que el mero intento de juntarlos en un paquetito era un grave error. Después de eso le comento que no lo volviera a hacer por el mero hecho de que se metería en problemas al ser tan extremista y se volvió a su habitación para seguir escribiendo cosas por su cuenta.\n\nGrande es la sorpresa de todo aquel que ha encontrado esta hoja de papel al saber que OBVIAMENTE este dictador del pensamiento no iba ha dejar pasar por alto este confrontamiento de palabras y esta clase de vacilación ante su majestuosa figura, así que se regreso a \"su cueva del pensamiento\" (es figurativo) y se propuso a preparar su venganza.\n\nY aquella venganza anteriormente dicha no era moco de pavo, pues de un día para otro empezó a recibir una cantidad de cartas con amenazas de muerte en su interior y otras cosas macabras como ojos falsos de gominola en la mochila o grafitis en su taquilla. Con el pasar de los días no sabia quien era aquel que lo tenia en aquel estado constante de \"tormento\" y \"desesperanza\", pero descubrió con el tiempo quien era el autor de todas estas cosas: El dictador del pensamiento.\n\nCon rabia se fue para su \"cueva del pensamiento\" y lo encaro con rabia por la poca madurez que tenia al no soportar que día tras día escribía cosas que iban en contra de lo que este tipejo opinaba, pero mas alla de acobardarse y echarse para atrás, este decidió echarle cojones al asunto y lo encaro también con su supuesta \"mala educación\" y su \"poca madurez\" al no aceptar su doctrina y sus opiniones personales fundadas en sus propias conjeturas y pruebas.\n\nPara la desgracia del poeta no todo se quedaría en aquella pelea verbal.... Para nada. Una vez que Dios apago la hoguera del cielo y la bella dama de plata se dispuso a observar la oscuridad del planeta, el dictador se colo a la ventana del poeta y lo quiso matar con una daga para clavársela en el corazón, pero por suerte no funciono: Gustavo, atraído por las llamas de la pasión de un hombre en su divina juventud, se lanzo a la cama de la chavala de la habitación de al lado debido a que ambos se llamaban la atención en muchas formas distintas. Así que el dictador no tuvo la ocasión de matarlo aquella misma noche.\n\nMas ahí no se quedo la cosa, decidió darle una patada a la puerta de la chavala de al lado y amenazo de manera teatral al poeta con un duelo a muerte para así saber quien era merecedor de estar en aquel club de poesía, cosa que el rebelde poeta no se pensaba que se hiciera realidad porque el dictador se lanzo a su cuello con el cuchillo en mano de manera súbita. Como respuesta, este alzo su pierna para defenderse de su ataque y se encontró de la manera mas horrenda posible como el dictador se cayo al suelo y la daga encima de este, atravesando su tráquea y finalmente callándolo para siempre.\n\nAquella noche se quedaría grabado a fuego en la cabeza del poeta por la escena en la que se vio envuelto y por sus propias conclusiones sobre porque había sucedido eso. Al final no termino ni la carrera ni nada por el estilo y se dio a la fuga del lugar por obvias razones.\n\nAhora la pregunta seria, querido lector.... ¿Acaso la bombilla se te encenderá? Mire usted que no soy mas que un loco mas tirado en el salón, pero en algún momento atinare a la tecla que te vibre en lo mas profundo de su corazón: La escuela, la muerte, el pensamiento, la libertad..... libertad.... Para que quieres expresarte si no tienes libertad? Hazme un favor, alma mía: Tu no digas ni pio. No somos mas que un auditorio de oídos sordos y un publico con las manos llenas de sangre....\n\n-Infamouskron"},"325":{"title":"A Werewolf in the Road ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fl2v9t\/a_werewolf_in_the_road\/","flair":"Video","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fQfvDccM2hA?si=cNqJ9v0REj5MpJ0S\n\nA group of teenagers decides to take their parents' car to go to a party in a neighboring town, but on the way down a deserted road, they hit something strange.

I was driven back to Campus by Officer Jackson and he let me out in the parking lot next to the commons area where I met the three. I was walking by and I saw Greg and his goons sitting on a couch. I didn’t want to but I had to. I wanted to find the three before the police did. I want to know why they did what they did. Maybe he saw them last night. I walked into the commons area and towards Greg.\n\n\n\n“Hey Greg, have you seen Eric?” I asked with as much politeness as I could muster. \n\n\n\n“You might want to leave, freak.” Greg said slowly standing up to intimidate me.\n\nMy right arm started burning again.\n\n\n\n“Look, all three of them assaulted me last night outside of my dorm hall, I’m trying to find them and find out why.” I explained as quickly as possible before he would just hit me and get it over with.\n\n\n\n“He doesn’t get it, guys.” Greg said to his goons. One of them put his hand on Greg’s shoulder to try and calm him down. “You embarrassed me…in my own commons area…screw you…” Greg reared his fist back for a sucker punch.\n\n\n\nI close my eyes and flinch in preparation. My right arm felt searing hot and I felt it move up in a striking motion. I open my eyes as I see my right palm connect with Greg’s chest with a loud thud. Greg flew down onto the table behind him, almost breaking it. One of his goons went to his aid as the other one stood up to me. The one that put his hand on Greg’s shoulder. \n\n\n\n“They left last night. I was walking home from our party and I saw their car packed with alot of stuff.” He said quickly. “Now get out of here.”\n\n\n\nI leave as requested with the exact information I wanted. So they assault me and leave? What was the point of that? Where did they go?\n\n\n\n“...take me home…” the voice said. \n\n\n\n\n\n“Hanger’s Woods…” I said in sudden realization. I turn around and head towards the woods. On the way, I take out my phone and try to find any information on the ritual we performed in the woods. After about an hour of walking I was at the wood’s again. I finally found a website that explained the ritual.\n\n\n\n“This specific ritual is risky…” the website stated. “...while it can summon a spirit you must be careful. If the ritual is meant with ill intention it will commence in a different way. Instead of a temporary possession it will turn into a transference of consciousness. Basically, if one or more of the participants have already performed this ritual and have a temporary possession the spirit will find a new host. One of weak constitution and no temporary possession.”\n\n\n\nI put my phone away. I was only about 100 feet away from the gate. I hop over and head into the woods towards the ritual site. As I trekked through the brush I started hearing laughter. I started to follow that laughter and realized that I was about 50 feet away from the three. They were laughing. I’m here with a busted up head and they were laughing. My arm started to burn. \n\n\n\n“Not now, trust me.” I said quietly.\n\nThe burning subsided. I step out into the woods and I throw my Gatorade bottle towards them and hit Will in the chest. I stepped closer. \n\n\n\n\n\n“STOP!” Eric yelled toward me. “You don’t understand.” he explained.\n\n\n\n“Understand? You assaulted me last night. The police know who you are now. You’re done!” I screamed back. I started to cry, “All I wanted was friends…I never had friends before. You know, I was so happy that you guys found me. I just wanted to be friends…” I sobbed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEric slowly approached me. My arm was burning again. \n\n\n\n“Stay back, please…” I said tearfully.\n\n\n\n“Ryan…we had to do it.” Eric started. “We were all a part of this…when we first did this…we messed up. The Hangman entered Emily first. He was inside her head. She couldn’t control what she said or really anything. It was a miracle that we found Will. We were able to transfer the Hangman to him but some remnants stuck with Emily. Emily and Will were slowly being taken over. We were at the end of our rope. That’s when we saw you.” \n\n\n\n“How long did you know I was your victim?” I asked.\n\n\n\n“We knew….for awhile.” Eric replied.\n\n\n\n“Did you…..stalk me?” I asked. My right arm starting to burn with more intensity.\n\n\n\n“...yes.” Eric responded. “Look, we did what we had to do and once we knew you were able to take it…”\n\n\n\n“Stop…” I interrupted. \n\n\n\nEric approached me and I started tearing up again. \n\n\n\n“...let me help you…” My right arm stiffens up and strikes Eric in the chest with my palm sending him backward about ten feet. “...you tried to send me back…” I said, realizing that I have lost control of my voice now. “...I like it here and I want to spread myself to everyone…” I said.\n\n\n\n“Eric, RUN! It’s happening again!” Will screams out.\n\nEric slowly starts to rise to his feet just as my right hand connects with his face. \n\n\n\n“STOP!” I yelled in my own voice. I felt sick seeing the blood dripping from his nose.\n\n\n\n“I don’t want to hurt anyone, I…..just want closure.” I said. My arm slowly returning to normal. \n\n\n\n“Just go, I got what I wanted.” I said softly to Eric. “But please, don’t ever come back.”\n\n\n\nEmily was two steps ahead already rushing through the woods, Will gave chase and soon after Eric. They disappeared into the woods behind a mess of fallen trees and leaves. That was the last time I ever saw them. I haven’t heard of any reports of their capture by Police. So I guess they were free. While a part of me hates them with a passion, another part understands why they did it. No one wants to live with this…parasite in them. Except, for me. I kind of enjoy it to be honest. I feel invincible, like I have superpowers. I feel that I could help the weak realize something more in themselves. I’m sitting here in the commons area writing this. It’s my Sophomore year and surprise surprise Greg and his goons were picking on someone new.\n\n\n\nI watched as Greg approached this kid with a rageful look. He starts saying the same old tired speech he said to me last year. Word for word. Before the violence ensued I stood up.\n\n\n\n“Greg…” I said. He looked at me and my right arm stiffened and my fist clenched. Greg stopped what he was saying and walked away without saying a word. The kid was obviously frightened and weak. What a great chance to help him grow stronger. I slowly walk over him and put my hand on his right shoulder. He looks up at me smiling.\n\n\n\n“You look like you could use a friend…”"},"327":{"title":"You Don't Remember Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fks1g5\/you_dont_remember_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Beefy_Boogerlord","selftext":"It's difficult to quantify what has been happening in my life lately. There is something very wrong. Someone who is after me. I know I've seen them. I know they've been in my apartment, and I feel so sure that it was while I was here, but I just... can't remember anything specific about them, which is crazy because things keep getting worse, and I know there has to be someone behind this. I didn't imagine their presence. I remember... legs and arms and anger... but no. Nothing solid. The flashes I get aren't good.\n\nI keep losing time. And it's not like a blackout. It's like there was something erased while I was awake and aware. I'm standing there and it dawns on me that I don't recall the last few minutes, again and again. I get fresh cuts and bruises I can't account for. My furniture is knocked over or broken sometimes and I couldn't tell you when it happened. My cat went missing and I don't know how long ago. And more and more I get hit with this horrible feeling like I've just been through some new trauma I can't place. I've forgotten it, but my body remembers. It feels like I'm not safe here at home, or maybe anywhere.\n\nI can't imagine how someone could erase themselves from your mind whenever they want. I want to try to take a picture or a video or get some kind of evidence, but every time I realize they've been here again, the opportunity has already passed. How am I failing?\n\nI tried to run away a few days ago, and I can't even leave now!

As soon as they left, I felt the timeskip again, and the gun was back. It's always pointed toward me. There was no note or message of any kind about it, just the implication.\n\nI've thought about this as hard as I can. Tried to nail down any detail that could unravel this mystery for me. The best I can recall is just a phrase, not even the voice that uttered it.\n\n*\"You don't remember me.\"*\n\n...and I still don't."},"328":{"title":"I'm not crazy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fku0i7\/im_not_crazy\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"sisoiqadra","selftext":"I’m not crazy. I knew that was what they thought, what they all thought, but they were wrong. I have spent weeks, maybe even months, trying to make them understand. Not that it mattered; nobody listens to me. They call it a breakdown, a psychotic episode. But I saw what happened. I saw the truth. I'm not crazy.\n\nThey call it a disorder, as if I was crazy. When I first came here, they tried to convince me that I was seeing things, they tried to tell me that I was crazy when I'm not, and they tried telling me that what happened was something that could've been prevented. Now I'm stuck here, in this ugly room, where there are people that, unlike me, are crazy.\n\nThat therapy room is cold, the walls are washed-out gray, like everything else in this place. This morning I sat in a circle with the other patients, who stared vacantly at the floor, lost in whatever corners of their minds held them prisoners. Across from me, the therapist sat, her expression calm and practiced. She had one of those faces that never gave anything away. I hated that. How could I know what she was thinking if she didn’t show it?\n\n“It started slowly,” I began, my voice raspy, cracking from weeks of repeating the same story over and over. The therapist nodded, her pen ready to scribble down my words. It didn’t matter what I said; they were just notes to her, more material to analyze. “I’m not crazy,” I muttered, feeling the stares of the other patients pressing down on me.\n\nI closed my eyes, forcing myself back to that time before it all went wrong. My job had consumed me. I was always buried in work, staying late at the office, bringing piles of paperwork home with me. I barely had time for Elena and the kids. They understood, or at least, they pretended to. Elena would say, \"You’re doing this for us,\" whenever I apologized for missing another dinner. The truth was, I missed many dinners. I missed bedtime stories, movie nights, weekends at the park. I was always lost in the stress of deadlines, projects, promotions—the endless grind.\n\nIt was during one of those long nights at my desk that I first noticed something had changed. I came home to find the house eerily quiet, too quiet for a family with two young children. The air felt thick, suffocating. Elena was in the kitchen, standing motionless in the dark. When I flicked on the light, she jumped, as if caught in some forbidden act. She turned to me, and I swear, her eyes glinted with a strange light. Not the familiar warmth of my wife’s gaze but something cold, calculating.\n\n“I’m just tired,” she had said, forcing a smile. I wanted to believe her. God, I wanted to believe her. But after that night, things only got worse.\n\nI opened my eyes, returning to the sterile room. “They started changing,” I said, glancing around at the others, hoping for a flicker of understanding. There was none. The therapist kept writing, her eyes never leaving me.\n\n“What kind of changes?” she asked, her voice cool and cynical.\n\n“They weren’t themselves,” I continued, running a hand through my hair. “Elena’s voice… it was off. She pronounced words wrong, and there was this strange rhythm to her speech. At first, I thought she was just mocking me, making fun of how I wasn’t around much.” I shook my head, gripping the arms of my chair. “But it wasn’t a joke. It was something else. Like she was trying to pretend to be my wife.”\n\nThe kids, too, started acting strangely. I used to come home to their laughter, but now they barely spoke to me. They would sit on the couch, holding hands, watching me with wide, unblinking eyes. I would talk to them, ask them about their day, but they would just smile and stare. That smile... It wasn’t the innocent, joyful one I remembered. It was wrong, like a mask stretched over their faces.\n\n“At night, I would wake up and find them standing in the doorway of our bedroom, just... staring,” I said, my voice quivering as I recounted those moments. “They whispered to each other. It was like listening to the wind howl through a forest, all hisses and clicks. No comprehensible words at all”\n\nThe therapist scribbled something in her notebook, glancing at me over the rim of her glasses. “And did you try talking to them about this?” she asked, her tone almost mocking. She didn’t believe me. None of them did.\n\n“Of course, I did! I’m not crazy!” I snapped. “I asked them what they were doing, why they were acting so strange, but they’d just laugh it off. Elena would say I was working too much, that I was stressed.” I felt my anger rising, my hands clenching into fists. “I was working too much, but that didn’t mean I imagined it. I started noticing bruises on their skin, strange marks like tiny claws had scratched them. I’d ask, and they would just look at me, smiling, as if I’d asked the stupidest question in the world.”\n\nI rubbed my temples, feeling the headache building again. It always came when I tried to remember those days. “I thought I was losing it. I even went to a doctor, got a check-up. But I was fine. There was nothing wrong with me.” I leaned forward, locking eyes with the therapist. “I’m not crazy. I know what I saw.”\n\nMy nights became sleepless. I would lie awake, listening to them move around the house, whispering, plotting. One night, I set up cameras. I needed proof, something to confirm I wasn’t imagining things. But every morning, the footage was gone, wiped clean. I confronted Elena, demanded to know what was happening. She just looked at me with that look, that cold, unfeeling stare. “You’re not well,” she said. “You’re working too hard.”\n\nI gritted my teeth, feeling the sting of those words. They used my guilt against me, made me doubt myself. But then I saw it, and I knew. That final night... God, I’ll never forget it.\n\nI slumped back into my chair, staring at the floor. “I came home early. I thought I’d catch them off guard.” I swallowed, my throat dry, recalling the sight that awaited me. “Elena was in the kitchen, pretending to be speaking to something in the dark. I couldn’t see what it was, but I felt it, like a presence pressing down on me, filling the room with that sickly sweet smell.” I glanced around the therapy room, the shadows flickering in the dim light. “Her skin... it moved. Rippling like water, peeling away. And her eyes, they glowed, bright yellow, like an animal’s caught in the night.”\n\nThe room was silent. Even the other patients seemed to be holding their breath. I took a shaky one myself, fighting the panic rising in my chest. “The kids crawled out of the shadows,” I continued, my voice barely more than a whisper now. “Their bones... bent the wrong way. Their mouths stretched open, pretending to smile; but it was too wide, too many teeth.” I clenched my eyes shut, hearing their hissing laughter echo in my skull.\n\n“I had to stop them,” I said, my voice breaking. “I grabbed the knife... I had to. They weren’t my family anymore. They were monsters wearing their skin. They would’ve killed me. I was saving them. I was—”\n\n“You were saving them,” the therapist interjected, her voice cold and detached. “From what?”\n\nI looked at her, my heart pounding in my chest. “From whatever had replaced them,” I croaked. “You don’t believe me, do you? I’m not crazy” I asked, my eyes burning with fury and despair. “But you saw it too. The police found the marks on their bodies, marks that didn’t make sense. You read the reports.”\n\nShe said nothing, just stared at me, scribbling in her notebook. I glanced around the room, feeling my sanity slipping through my fingers. The lights flickered, and for a split second, I saw it: the therapist’s face blurred, her skin rippling like a disturbed pool of water. I blinked, and it was gone.\n\n“You saw it too!” I screamed “I’m not crazy! They’re still out there!” I thrashed as they grabbed me, gesturing me to get out. “You have to believe me!”\n\nAs they dragged me out, I caught one last glimpse of the therapist. Her eyes glinted with a sickly yellow light, and she smiled, her lips stretching just a bit too far.\n\nAs I leave yet another meeting, I knew they would never believe me.\n\nUnlike them all, I’m not crazy."},"329":{"title":"Never Alone, Restless Curse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fl59l0\/never_alone_restless_curse\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"rarriaga89","selftext":"I remember the first time I saw it—or thought I did. It was more like a flicker in the corner of my eye, a dark blur slipping out of view just as I turned my head. I was sitting at my kitchen table, staring into a cup of cold coffee, when something moved near the doorway. Just a quick, dark flash, there and gone. I blinked, shook my head, and convinced myself it was nothing—just my tired mind playing tricks. After all, I hadn’t been sleeping well, and after everything that had happened, it made sense for my brain to be a little scrambled.\n\n\n\nLife had been a series of blurry, aimless days since my breakdown. I don’t remember the exact moment it started, just the slow unraveling of everything I thought I knew. My job, my friends, my sense of self—they all slipped through my fingers like sand. I’d tried to hold it together, to be the person everyone expected me to be, but it all fell apart anyway. The breakdown was like hitting a wall, a sudden, violent end to the pretense of normalcy.\n\n\n\nI lost my job not long after that. Stopped showing up. Stopped answering calls. My friends and family reached out at first, their voices full of concern and pity, but eventually, they stopped too. I think they got tired of trying to reach someone who wasn’t there anymore.\n\n\n\nSo, I stayed in my little basement apartment, a space that felt like a cocoon and a prison all at once. It wasn’t much—just a couple of rooms with creaky floors and dim lighting, but it was mine. The only place I didn’t have to pretend. I thought I was alone there. I thought I could finally breathe. But I was wrong.\n\n\n\nThe first note appeared one morning, stuck to my bathroom mirror. I’d just stepped out of the shower, steam still clinging to the glass, when I saw it—a simple, yellow post-it with a message scrawled in neat, blocky handwriting.\n\n**You’re doing a great job. Keep going.**\n\nI froze, staring at the words until the steam blurred them into fuzzy lines. My heart was pounding in my chest, a panicked rhythm that seemed to echo in the small room. I couldn’t remember putting the note there. I couldn’t remember writing it. But I’d been so scattered lately, so lost in my own head, that it was easy to convince myself I had. Maybe I was trying to be kind to myself, to give myself a little push. I peeled the note off the mirror and stuck it in the trash, my hands trembling.\n\n\n\nI didn’t mention it to anyone. I just… kept going, like the note said. What else was there to do?\n\n\n\nA few days later, I was talking to my sister on the phone. She’s always been the one I turned to, the one person who never judged me, no matter what. I told her about the note, about how strange it was, and she listened quietly. When I finished, there was a long pause on the other end of the line.\n\n\n\n“You know,” she said slowly, “I think it’s a good thing.”\n\n\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked, frowning.\n\n\n\n“It’s like… you’re trying to take care of yourself, even if it’s subconscious. You’ve been through a lot, and it’s okay to need a little help, even from yourself.” She hesitated, then added, “You know I’m always here, right? If you need to talk, or just… not be alone.”\n\n\n\nHer words hit me harder than I expected. I hadn’t realized how much I needed to hear them. For the first time in a long while, I felt a small spark of warmth in my chest.\n\n\n\n“Thanks,” I whispered. “I appreciate it.”\n\n\n\n“Why don’t we go out this weekend?” she suggested. “Just for a change of scenery. It’ll be good for you.”\n\n\n\nI agreed, and for the first time in weeks, I felt something close to hope.\n\n\n\nThe second note came the day before I was supposed to meet her. It was on the back of a book I’d left on the kitchen counter.\n\n\n\n**Be proud of yourself. You’ve come so far.** But the writing seems less clear. like it was written in a hurry. \n\n\n\nI read it over and over, feeling something warm and unfamiliar stir inside me. It was like a small light flickering in the darkness, a tiny beacon of hope that maybe, just maybe, I could pull myself out of this pit. I put the note in my journal, a little memento of what felt like progress.\n\n\n\nThe next few days were almost peaceful. I spent time with my sister, went out for dinner, even sang karaoke one night. It felt good to be out of the house, to feel the world around me again, even if just for a little while. My sister had a way of making everything seem lighter, less daunting.\n\n\n\n“You’re not sad,” she said one evening, as we sat in a small, cozy bar. “You’re not depressed. You’re just bored. You need to get out more, live a little.”\n\n\n\nMaybe she was right. I laughed, a real, genuine laugh, and for a moment, it felt like things could be normal again.\n\n\n\nBut the feeling didn’t last.\n\n\n\nThe night I came back from karaoke, I was walking down the hallway, heading to the bathroom, when I saw it again—a dark figure, peeking around the corner at the far end. It was just a flash, a quick movement that sent a jolt of fear through me. The figure receded slightly, but I could still see it peeking at me, even without eyes. I stopped, staring, my heart pounding in my ears.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t move. Just stayed there, half-hidden behind the corner, its head tilted slightly as if watching me. I could feel its gaze, cold and oppressive, and I took a hesitant step forward.\n\n\n\nThe figure darted back, disappearing around the corner. I hesitated, then hurried to the end of the hallway, peeking around the corner myself.\n\n\n\nNothing. The hallway stretched empty before me, the dim light casting long shadows on the walls. I let out a shaky breath, backing away slowly. As I turned, I saw it again—this time, peeking around the opposite corner, closer, its head tilted in that same eerie way.\n\n\n\nMy body went cold. The air around me felt heavy, suffocating. It was real. I wasn’t imagining it. The figure was there, watching me, moving just out of reach. I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet, and when I looked again, it was gone.\n\n\n\nI rushed into the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind me. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely turn on the light. I splashed water on my face, trying to calm down, but I couldn’t get the image out of my mind—that dark figure, silently observing, moving just out of reach.\n\n\n\nThe next note appeared in the kitchen, taped to the fridge, a page torn from my journal.\n\n\n\n**“Why are you gone?”**\n\n\n\nIt felt like a slap in the face, a sudden shift from the previous messages. I stared at it for a long time, feeling a mixture of anger and fear churn in my gut. It wasn’t encouraging anymore. It wasn’t kind. It was… accusing.\n\n\n\nI ripped the note off the fridge and threw it away, my hands trembling. I tried to tell myself it was a prank, that someone was messing with me. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. This was something else, something darker.\n\n\n\nThat night, I saw the figure again. I was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, my mind a tangled mess of anxiety and fear. I hadn’t been able to sleep, my thoughts too loud, too chaotic. I turned my head, and there it was, standing in the doorway.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. It was closer now, its shape more defined but still featureless, a dark silhouette against the pale light from the hallway. And then, it did something it hadn’t done before.\n\nIt raised a hand, pointing directly at me.\n\nI felt a cold chill sweep over me, like ice water trickling down my spine. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, my body frozen in place. The figure stood there, arm outstretched, its faceless head tilted slightly as if it were studying me.\n\nIts body shuddered, as if it were struggling to maintain its form, and then it began to breathe. Long, ragged breaths, each one sounding like a death rattle. I could hear the air scraping through it, a wheezing, unnatural sound that sent waves of terror rippling through me.\n\nIt took a step closer, its arm still outstretched, and I felt my heart slam against my ribs, the panic clawing at my throat. I wanted to scream, to run, but I was paralyzed, pinned under its gaze.\n\nThe figure’s breaths grew louder, more labored, and it took another step forward. I felt the temperature drop, the air turning icy cold, and I could see my breath misting in front of me.\n\nAnd then, in a voice that was low and raspy, like dead leaves scraping over concrete, it whispered a single word: “Never.”\n\nThe sound echoed in the silence, filling the room, reverberating through my bones. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block it out, but it was everywhere, wrapping around me like a suffocating shroud.\n\nWhen I finally opened my eyes, the figure was gone. I was alone, shivering, my body trembling uncontrollably. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night, every creak and groan of the house sending my heart racing.\n\nI called my sister, my voice shaking as I tried to explain what was happening. She listened quietly, and then, after a long pause, she said, “You need to see someone.. Please. For me.”\n\nI didn’t want to. I didn’t want to admit that I was losing my mind, that I couldn’t handle this on my own. But I was so tired, so scared, that I agreed.\n\nT“What do I do?” I whispered.\n\n“Think of it like facing an echo,” she said. “An echo can seem overwhelming, but it has no substance, no real power. When you hear it, acknowledge it. Don’t run from it, but don’t let it take root in you, either. Remember, the echo can only exist where there are walls for it to bounce off.”\n\nShe looked at me intently, her eyes kind. “Let those walls fall. Show it that you’re not afraid, that you’ve moved beyond where it can reach.”\n\n“But what if it gets louder?” I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nShe smiled gently. “Then let it. Acknowledge it, let it pass. Know that it’s just noise. It can’t touch you anymore. The storm may have left wreckage, but you are not part of that debris.”\n\nHer words hung in the air, and for the first time in a long while, I felt something shift inside me—a small but determined spark.\n\n“I’ll try,” I said, my voice steadier.\n\n“That’s all you need to do,” she murmured. “One moment, one breath at a time.”\n\nShe prescribed me some medication to help me sleep and my anxiety and I begrudgingly took it. I had been on meds before. I didn't like it. I felt better but something made me stop. Something inside me told me that the meds were making me worse.\n\nI didn’t want to, but I was desperate. The pills sat on my kitchen counter for a week before I finally took one, the plastic bottle rattling like a taunt. I didn’t want to take them. I didn’t want to admit that I needed help, that I couldn’t handle this on my own. But I was so tired, so scared, that I swallowed the pill with a shuddering breath.\n\nFor a few days, nothing happened. The figure was gone, the notes stopped. I felt almost normal, almost sane. But there was a sadness too, a quiet, lingering emptiness. I was relieved, but I also felt like I had lost something, like I was abandoning a part of myself.\n\nAnd then, everything changed.\n\nI was in the kitchen, making tea. I hadn’t seen the figure all day, and I felt lighter, almost normal. I was reaching for a cup when I felt it—a presence behind me, cold and oppressive. I turned slowly, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nIt was standing in the doorway, its shape darker than the shadows around it. Faceless, featureless, but unmistakably there. I froze, my breath caught in my throat. It didn’t move. It just stood there, staring at me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.\n\nIt started to breathe, long, labored breaths that rattled through the silence, each one more strained than the last. It sounded wrong, like it was struggling, like it was angry. The air around me seemed to vibrate, to pulse with the sound, and I felt a pressure building, pressing down on me, squeezing the air from my lungs.\n\nIt took another step forward, the darkness around it growing denser, and I felt something cold and sharp twist inside me. I gasped, my body jerking, and for a moment, I was certain I was going to die.\n\nAnd then it whispered, so softly I almost missed it:\n\n“Your fault. Rage”\n\nThe voice hit me like a punch to the gut, and suddenly, I knew. It was the \"Rage\" that did it. Only one person said that. Only one person had ever called me that. I knew who this was, who this had always been. The realization crashed over me like a wave, and I felt my knees give out, my body crumpling to the floor.\n\n“It’s you,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “It’s been you all along.”\n\nThe figure loomed over me, its form shuddering, twisting. And in that moment, I saw it—not the shadow, but him. His face, gaunt and hollow, his eyes wide with something like anger, or fear, or maybe both. His body was thin, almost skeletal, the way it had been at the end, before everything fell apart.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I sobbed, my hands clutching at the floor. “I’m so sorry.”\n\nHis form flickered, and for a moment, I thought he might disappear. But then, slowly, he shook his head, his face contorted with rage.\n\n“You left me,” he hissed, his voice a rasping, broken thing. “You let me die.”\n\nTears streamed down my face, my whole body shaking. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean to… I told you so many times to stop. I—”\n\n“You left me alone!” he roared, his form swelling, filling the room with darkness. “You’re a coward. A liar.”\n\n“No,” I said, my voice shaking but growing stronger. “I didn’t leave you. You left me long before I ever walked away.”\n\nThe shadow seemed to recoil, its form shuddering in the darkness. I took a step forward, my eyes locked on the twisted, faceless shape before me.\n\n“I loved you,” I said, my voice breaking but fierce. “I stood by you through everything—through the yelling, the lies, the threats. I tried to be there, to help you, but you just kept pushing me away, hurting me over and over.”\n\nI took another step, my anger and pain fueling me now. “You wanted me to endure everything—your words that tore me down, the bruises you left behind, the fear you used to control me. And when that wasn’t enough, you turned to the drugs. How much more was I supposed to take? How much of myself was I supposed to lose for you?”\n\nThe figure writhed, its outline flickering, distorting. I could almost see his face now, twisted with anger and something else—something like fear.\n\n“I didn’t run away because I was weak,” I continued, my voice rising. “I walked away because I finally understood that I deserved better. That I deserved to be safe, to be happy. You weren’t going to let that happen. You would have destroyed me if I’d stayed.”\n\nThe shadow flared, its form growing larger, darker, but I didn’t back down. “I loved you,” I whispered, my voice raw. “But that love wasn’t worth losing myself. I had to let you go, because holding on to you meant losing me.”\n\nFor a moment, everything seemed to freeze—the air around me, the darkness pressing in, his shadow looming over me. And then, slowly, the figure began to shrink, its edges blurring, fading.\n\n“You made your choices,” I said, my words steady and clear. “You chose to hurt me, to destroy yourself, and now you want to blame me for surviving? I won’t carry that guilt. Not anymore.”\n\nThe shadow wavered, its form flickering like a dying flame. I watched it, my breath steady, my heart finally calm.\n\n“I’m done being haunted by you,” I said softly. “I’m done being afraid.”\n\nAnd with that, the figure dissolved into the darkness, leaving me standing alone but unbroken.\n\n“I hate you,” he whispered, his voice so soft, so broken, it made my heart ache. “I’ll never forgive you.”\n\n\"I know.\" I whispered. \"That is why you'll never get better. You  are dead Daniel and you are still killing yourself.\"\n\nAnd then, just like that, he was gone. The room was empty, silent. I lay on the floor, shaking, my body numb, my mind reeling.\n\nIt took a long time to get up, to pull myself together. I didn’t know what to do, didn’t know how to move forward. But I did. Slowly, painfully, I got up. I took the pills. I went to therapy. I talked to my sister, told her everything.\n\nThe figure didn’t come back after that. Not like before, anyway. The notes still appeared, sometimes—sweet, kind ones, like at the beginning. Other times, they were cruel, blaming. But they were rare, like echoes of a memory that couldn’t quite let go. \n\nI stayed on the medication. I kept going to therapy. I tried to move on, to let go of the guilt, the anger. It wasn’t easy, and sometimes, it felt like I was just pretending. But I kept trying.\n\nNow, sometimes, I still see him. Just a flicker in my periphery, a shadow that lingers a little too long. But he doesn’t scare me anymore. Not really. Because I know what he is now. I know who he is.\n\nAnd I know that I’m stronger than he is.\n\nI used to think I was haunted, that I would never be free. But I was wrong. I’m not the one who’s haunted anymore.\n\nHe is.\n\nBecause I’m still here. I’m still standing. And he’s just a ghost, a shadow, a memory that can’t hurt me anymore.\n\nHe never escaped me.\n\nAnd he never will.\n\n"},"330":{"title":"A Mother's Obsession | Creepypastas to stay awake to","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fkweoz\/a_mothers_obsession_creepypastas_to_stay_awake_to\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"TheDarkPath962","selftext":"Hope you guys like it:  \n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/MQqrOax77Ys](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MQqrOax77Ys)"},"331":{"title":"Feed the hunger(part 3)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fl43sw\/feed_the_hungerpart_3\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TapThink8687","selftext":"Feed the hunger (pt 3)\nBy Alex Valencia \n\nI put the gun in my bag and picked up Paige’s bag as well. The whole walk back I didn’t dare make a sound, how could I? I had just murdered 2 people within a minute. I was afraid. Afraid of myself.\n\nAs soon as I got back to Paige I started to tend to her wounds. “Are you okay?” She asked, “I heard a gunshot earlier.”\n“Must have been Kaleb messing around,” I replied.\n“Oh, ok.”\nI couldn’t tell her yet. Even though I did it for her I couldn’t bring myself to admit to such a thing. I was already scared, who knows how SHE would have reacted. I built us a fire and set up our sleeping bags, thankfully we were supposed to sleep in tents at the camp so the school had us bring them. As soon as I finished setting down my pillow I realized it had been Hours since we last ate. I remember hearing somewhere that as long as it has water, the human body can survive without food for like 3 weeks. Me and Paige both had water jugs so we would be fine as long as we rationed it. Then I remembered that Paige was wounded. She would probably need more water than I did to replace all the fluids she lost from bleeding. Fuck! \n\nMy thought was interrupted by the growling of Paige’s stomach. “Sorry,” she said. “You’re fine, hey you didn’t happen to pack any food did you?”\n“Oh yeah! I brought a cliff bar with me! Did you want to split it?”\nI thought for a moment.\n“Nah, you can have it.”\n“You sure? We don’t know how long we’ll be out here for, and we have to keep our strength up.”\n“Don’t worry about me, you’re the one who’s wounded and I have to focus on keeping you alive.”\n“Ok…”\nI couldn’t tell if it was just from the cold, but her face seemed to be flushed.\n“Here, you need to stay warm.”\nI moved her sleeping bag closer to the fire and helped her wobble over to lay down.\n“Get some sleep, you need rest to recover”\n“Alright, goodnight Hunter”\n“Goodnight Paige”\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night.\nMy stomach felt like it was trying to eat me from the inside out, I needed food. Where could I find food? The huckleberry bush! \nI wandered through the dark forest and made my way back to the spot where I faced off against Kaleb and Sam. \nI tried to be quiet as I approached the clearing, surely a wild animal would have found this banquet by now. Hopefully the animal was looking for the berries rather than the corpses. \n\nWhen I arrived at the bush I was met with the sight of a grizzly bear licking it's paws clean of berry juice, I could hear my heart beating in my chest. I tried to remember what my dad had told me to do if I was ever faced with a situation involving a bear but I was drawing a blank. I was running out of time, it was only a matter of seconds before he finished grooming himself and noticed me. I slowly started to step backwards to try and get away without alerting the grizzly, but karma had finally arrived for me. “KRCHK!” The bear turned to look at me and immediately started charging, in a panic I dropped to the ground and covered my head with my hands. It was too late to get out of this without being hurt, but hopefully I could minimize the damage. The beast growled before swatting me with it's enormous paw, his claws digging into my back. I let out pained cry “HAAUGH!!” This fucking brute was clawing the shit out of me, but I knew I deserved it. This was the least I should have been punished with for what I did. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the grizzly finally walked off and left me alone after toying with me. With adrenaline coursing through my body, I weakly lifted myself and leaned against a tree. I needed food, especially after that. But where else could I find it? At this point I was willing to eat ANYTHING as long as it had… pro… tein…\n\nMaggots squirming throughout the muscle fibers and flies swarming around the blood soaked skull. A haunting aura surrounded the body and drew me in. As if time itself stopped, the forest grew eerily silent so that I could hear nothing except for the buzzing of the flies and squelching of the maggots. I wish I had ANY other choice, I wish I could fucking eat Sam for gods sake! But wishing was pointless. I got down on my hands and knees to further inspect the carcass, and sat there for hours. Not once did I take my eyes off of it, I stared at every detail from the cracks in the skull to every strand of fur that coated the skin. I grabbed a handful of dirt and sprinkled it around the body to clear away the flies, then I dug my fingernails into the stringy meat. I pulled it off the bones and shoved it into my mouth. I licked the blood and wriggling larvae off of the rib cage. I devoured every single piece of meat until there was nothing but bones left. When all was said and done I picked up the skull and scraped out the brain matter inside. I put it in my backpack and walked back to our shelter.\n"},"332":{"title":"Looking for creepypasta recommendations.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fkq6or\/looking_for_creepypasta_recommendations\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Castiel_TheDragon","selftext":"As the title states, I'm looking for creepypasta recommendations as I want to read more.

Early for us at least. 10am the next day. Ray wouldn’t be up for another two hours. Maybe three.\n\nThe morning light shone through the window, bright beams gently shooting through the partitions in the plastic blinds. It was nice, warm, and nostalgic. No rushing, no movement, no needless noise or persons stirring. Hot coffee going warm then going cold.\nI laid longways on the couch and read something waiting for Ray to wake up. Shitty informercials on the TV whispering in a low hush. The book I was reading had to have been either ‘Catcher In The Rye’ or ‘Fahrenheit 451’, I don’t remember exactly just that it was something I stole from our High School library.\nThe light shone, I read, and just when I had decided I had all of the quiet morning I could take the phone rang. I stood up and tossed the book on the couch, dust like little fairies shot up out of the fabric and flew around in the new day, lingering in the light. I took my mug with me.\n\nThe home phone blared from the kitchen counter, assaulting the morning silence with digitized warbling. I picked it up, a sleek oblong piece of grey plastic with an ugly green screen for a face and buttons to match. I recognized the number on the screen almost instantly. It was my mother.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Why aren’t you home.” She didn’t ask. She said. Rather angrily. \n\n“I’m at Ray’s.” I paused. “I left a note.”\n\n“I saw.”\n\n“I just wanted to show him a CD I found.”\n\n“Where.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Where did you find this CD. I didn’t give you any money and you don’t have a job. So who’d you steal from?” I could smell the liquor through the phone.\n\n“No one. It was one of Derrick’s. Honest.”\n\n“So you stole from your brother.”\n\nI tried to think of something to respond with. “No. I’m not keeping it. I just was listening to it over the weekend.”\n\n“Well you’re at Ray’s. So it ain’t just the weekend.”\n\nI paused. Silent for a moment, thinking. I never really knew how to respond to her,“I’ll be home soon. Promise.”\n\n“Sure you will.” Dial tone. She hung up before I could retort.\n\nI returned the phone to the charging dock on the counter, reheated my coffee and went back to Ray’s room. \n\nStanding proud in the corner of his room next to his stereo and across from his bed was Ray’s “battle station”. A boxy illshaped cream coloured PC shadowed by phaux-wood cubbies and shelves. Blank CDs, PC games, cords, and speakers were crammed into every available space the desk had to offer. Breaking up the tech related humdrum were an assortment of knick-knacks, a single lava lamp, and the occasional empty soda or beer can. For the time it was all extremely impressive but looking back it just seems so prehistoric.\nRay hadn’t used it much since he got his copy of Halo 2. But even before that the only times he’d really use it is when we were high—— when for whatever reason we’d become completely enamored by a multitude of different extremely violent flash animations we’d found on either Stickpage(.)com or YouTube. It was always the same ones too. \n\nI set the mug on Ray’s desk then approached him, I placed a hand on his blanketed shoulder and shook him awake gently. Ray groaned.\n\n“Get your ass up. Coffee’s made.”\n\nHe groaned again, acknowledging my comment. \nI sat down in the computer chair and booted up Ray’s PC. With a few clicks I was on MapQuest looking up the street name my brother had provided for us the previous day. Found it. It was a ways out, about 30 minutes west of us. We weren’t terribly unfamiliar with the area. We had passed through there a time or two.\n\nI shuffled through all of the junk on Ray’s desk looking for something to write with and write on, knocking over a few empty soda cans in the process. I wrote the directions on the back of a receipt. \nRay sat up on the edge of the mattress. He sludged out of bed, blanket over his shoulders. Listlessly stealing my coffee from the desk, he sniffed it then took a sip.\n\nI scoffed, “Nah, it’s cool. It’s yours now.”\n\n“I thought you said you made coffee?” \n\nSquinting with grogginess, he studied the computer screen.\n\n“Those the directions?” \n\n“Yup.” \n\n“Ugh, we’re going this early?”\n\n“We agreed to do it first thing in the morning. Besides, we’ll be fine.” I said. “I’ll make myself another coffee since that one’s yours now. And when you’re dressed we’ll head that way. We can just grab something to eat on the way there.”\n\n“Word.” Ray groaned.\n\nThe rest of the morning came and went, as did the drive there. We passed by a few familiar sights, a few long forgotten ones, and some we’d never seen before.\nWe turned off of a main road and onto a shotty, less paved one which later turned into dirt and potholes. The suburban bumbled, kicking up bellows of dust behind it until we crawled to a stop. \n\n**Odor’s**\n\nWe sat parked in front of what we presumed to be Odor’s house, that is what still remained. Two large magnolia trees completely shrouded the front of the old building, a roof barely visible. What once accented the front of someone’s home had now grown unhindered for years. Sprawling knotted branches and wide dark green leaves obscured the entirety of the front porch and main entrance.\n\n“Alright, I think we should go home.” Ray muttered. “It’s obvious his parents aren’t here anymore.” His sweaty grip locked onto the steering wheel.\n\nFor someone as relaxed as Ray, the slightest hint of danger seemed to shake the guy right down to his core. While shaken at the thought of danger, Ray was always calm and collected in the face of it. Reluctance never riddled him long either, given a push he’d sign himself up for just about anything. He found courage in spite.\n\n“Don’t be such a fucking pussy, Ray.” I crassly consoled him, “His parents aren’t here. Big whoop. I say we hop out and have a look around the place. Besides it’s not like we haven’t snooped around places like this in the past.” Just as nervous as Ray, I tried not to show it for both his and my sake. \n\nRay sank into the fabric of the drivers seat, the car still running. Mulling something over in his brain. \n\n“In and out?” He asked in a dry tone, no doubt still nervous. \n\n“Promise.”\n\nWe stepped out of the vehicle and as we approached the old home Ray said, whilst turning back to look at his suburban, “Alright, we can go in. But just be aware that when we get home you are cleaning my car.” \n\nI objected and questioned, “What?”\n\n“Yes, what. That dusty ass road fucking covered my car.” \n\n“Whatever.” I continued walking.\n\nNot wanting to push through the half decade of growth that shadowed the front of the dilapidated structure, we headed for the back of the house. \nWalking along the side of the house I was able to really see the sort damage the passage of time had caused. At some point the paint had been blue but now it was chipped to all hell, sun-bleached, and entirely colorless. The roof sagged, caving in near the rear of the building. Everything at the back of the house was in horrible condition. The back entrance to the home was a doorless opening, the awning and the porch that may’ve once known Fourth of July parties and Cookouts was nothing but a pile of rotting plywood and shingles. \n\n“No way four years have passed.” I whispered to Ray.\n\n“No kidding. This is gnarly.”\n\n“Dude this is like a decade of decay. There’s no way.”\n\nNavigating the once-back-porch-now-pile-of-rot, stepping over rusted nails protruding through 2x4, we walked in through the doorless opening.\n\nAs we entered what may have been a laundry room, there was in the center of the floor a massive hole, just below an opening in the roof. At some point rain must’ve gotten in and waterlogged the hardwood floors, leaving the boards to decay in long silence. Ray and I hugged the wall to get around it, to get to the kitchen and dining room. \nIt was dark. Had it been night or had there been no windows we might not have been able to see anything. We certainly wouldn’t have been able to see the trash that was everywhere, thrown about all over the place. Broken glass, paper, magazines, containers, amenities, so much fucking shit. Just everywhere, dust and sand and time caked on all of it.\n\nAmidst the dust and the sand there were only faint traces of people passing through, sticking their noses in places that they shouldn’t, doing exactly what we were doing. In that moment, I couldn’t make out what kind of people they might have been, wanderers, homeless, thieves, or bored teenagers and twenty-somethings. There was no graffiti and most of what Odor and his folks left behind was still there. It was hard to tell what other people saw in the place or what they were using it for.\nRay passed through a door on the other end of the kitchen and went to I don’t know where. I went a different direction, walking through an archway in the dinning room.\n\nAs I entered the living room I shouted to Ray, “Be on the lookout for more CDs or eviction notices or whatever. Anything that might answer some questions.”\n\n“Roger.”\n\nLosing lottery tickets and cigarette butts littered the shag carpet, a lone TV in the corner of the living room sat across from a couch. I made my way past both, eyeing a staircase on the other end of the room the entire way. \nStanding at the bottom and looking up the staircase, a shut door stared back down at me. I creaked up one step at a time, the old wood squealing underfoot, one after the other. At the top of the stairs I tried the door, with a turn of the knob the bolts and springs echoed throughout the immediate area. I pushed the door open gently, the ancient hinges cried in an age worn way. Revealing a meek, dusty bedroom. \n\n“This has to have been Odor’s room.” I said to myself. \n\nA single bed sat across from a dresser, an end table beside the bed. A window illuminated the room, across from it was a closet door, the sliding kind with huge mirrors spanning the entirety of the door. \n\nI rifled through the dresser then through the drawer, not sure what exactly I needed to be looking for. More copies of the CDs, maybe a tape recorder, a lyric sheet, an extensive letter explaining why his house was in the condition it was, anything. I found nothing of note in the drawers. I shut the bottom drawer and then saw the corner of something peeking out from underneath the end table. I fetched it and stood up to better analyze what I was holding. \nIt was a notebook. College ruled, a thin wire spine circling down one side. Blue and beat to all hell, it had a massive crease right down the middle. It’s owner likely folded it and carried it in the back of their pocket. \n\n“Is this Odor’s journal?” I thought aloud. \n\nI flipped through it, page by page, treating each one like some kind of artifact. It was impressive and well loved. Pressed and taped to every other page were flowers or leaves, photographs of friends or places that were important to the writer, magazine cut outs, newspaper clippings, the likes. Beside, above, under, and around each one were words. Poems, journal entries, song lyrics, single sentences of thought, long paragraphs mourning some kind of loss. Figuratively, my jaw dropped. I had never before seen that level of creative commitment firsthand. It felt like I made a huge archaeological find, a breakthrough, a Rosetta Stone, something with which to cross-reference or that might decipher the nonsense of ‘Frykondula’.\nPaying no real attention to was written inside, I continued to flip through until something caught my eye. A photograph of my brother arm in arm with who I presumed was Odor. The words ‘The Outsider’ were scrawled in pen beneath the picture. Derrick looked far younger than he did at that point in time and far far younger than he does now, clean shaven, unkempt shoulder length hair, a leather necklace I forgot existed. He was standing next to a thinner young man. The person my brother was with was taller than him, had a buzzcut and wore a large sweater. The features of his face were beautifully pronounced, strong cheekbones, a straight nose, sharp eyebrows. I couldn’t envision the person in the photograph going psycho and killing some girl he may or may not have been secretly dating. I had a hard time believing that he just lost his mind and fell off the deep. Looking at Odor, or rather a picture of him, I didn’t know what to think.\n\nI ripped the photograph out of the notebook, folded it twice, then crammed it into my pocket. In that moment I tried to convince myself that I stole the picture from the journal to show Derrick later, for his nostalgia’s sake. In actuality, it was an attempt to further distance my brother from anything related to Odor and the disappearances. \nI folded the journal the same way it had been folded a thousand times in the past, put it in my back pocket then turned to leave.\n\nRay slinked up the stairs quickly and quietly, closing the bedroom door behind him slightly. It startled me a bit.\n\n“Dude, you almost gave me a heart attack.” I began to say haphazardly.\n\nHe shot his arms towards my face and covered my mouth. He looked around the room frantically, jerking his head from the window to the bed to the closet door. Then I heard it. Boots on glass. \n\nCold. Cold washed over me. A wave of frostlike shock lapped at my body. The adrenaline had worked it’s way from Ray to me. My eyes went wide and I watched Ray start for the closet door as someone casually stomped about the house somewhere beneath us. He slid the door open slow and silent, trying his damndest not to make any noise. I winced at every little creak or crack the old wood made.\nThe footfalls were distinctly unhurried. Whoever was looking for us, wasn’t sure where we were or which room we were in. They were taking their time.\n\nAfter a painful eternity of bated breath, he gestured for me to enter the closet. I tiptoed over and entered. When we were both inside, he carefully slid the door closed. Leaving only a sliver of light for me to look out of. \nWe waited. The sound of the clunky boots ebbed and flowed. They would be directly under us then after a moment or two would fade away deeper into the cavernous home. I wanted to whisper something to Ray, a question, something about being frightened, an idea on how to get out of the predicament. I said nothing. I was afraid of being heard.\nThen the broken glass and shuffling papers could no longer be heard, they were no longer underfoot. Instead, creaking. The footfalls came from the bottom of the stairs.\nThey were slow, nearly deliberate. Climbing their way up one by one. \nThen at the top of the staircase, there was nothing, only a long silence. I felt like a stick of dynamite, lit and ready to explode. I felt like a statue, nonconsensually cemented in place. I felt a million things.\n\nThe rusted hinges on the bedroom door groaned and the bulky boots padded softly into the room. My heart slowly began to drum louder and louder until blood coursed through my body like a torrent. It was deafening, I worried that it would give us away. \nI watched through the sliver of light and studied the person who had been and was still actively looking for us. The footfalls belonged to a large thinly bearded man. He wasn’t terribly intimidating but seemed angry and determined to find someone. It was hard to make out any further detail, the sliver only provided so much sight.\n\nHe continued to search for us, kneeling down and looking under the bed. The bed obstructed my view of him, I presumed he was reaching his hand underneath the bed feeling around for something or someone. Then he stood up, I could see him again. I could see that he had directed his attention to the closet door. Another icy surge assaulted my body. I felt as if his eyes had met mine.\n\nBefore he moved his way around the bed to where we were hiding, a female voice sounded out from downstairs, “They’re not here. You’re being paranoid. Let’s just go.”\n\nShe sounded bothered and annoyed.\n\nThe man issued out a heavy sigh, “You’re right. Probably just some noisy kids anyways.” He turned to the end table then shouted, “Give me one second, I’m gunna check for something.”\n\nHe stomped over to the end table and opened each of the drawers, shuffling about the contents inside.\n\n“Dammit. Where is that stupid thing.” He swore under his breath to himself.\n\nHe shuffled for a moment more then started for the bedroom door, slamming it behind him.\n\n“Still nothing.” He shouted to whoever was downstairs.\n\n“I told you. It’s gone. You’re not going to find it.” Her words began to trail off, growing quieter as his booted feet barreled further down the stairs. \n\nRay and I sat in the quiet closet for the longest time, only working up the courage to whisper after ten or so minutes had passed.\n\n“Who was that?” I shot the question in Ray’s direction. \n\n“I don’t know.” He said softly, nearly soundless. “I was in one of the other rooms looking out a window and saw them walking towards the house.”\n\n“Was there only two of them?”\n\n“Yeah.”\nRay hugged his knees in the corner of the closet, dark and obscured.\n\n“What was he looking for?” Ray asked.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know.” I raised my voice just above a whisper. “I think we’re good though.”\n\n“Good.” Ray said standing up, “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”\n\nWe all but ran back to the suburban and piled in. The hulking vehicle wobbled along the dirt road as Ray gassed it. Speeding and bouncing from pothole to pothole quicker than he should have.\n\n“Dude, slow down.” Ray was a live wire, I tried to put him at ease.\n\n“How did he know we were there?”\n\n“We parked outside.” I answered. “I know you’re nervous but he was probably just a neighbor or something.”\n\n“A neighbor would’ve just told us to leave. I don’t think they would’ve looked for us like that.” Ray chattered uneasily.\n\n“Dude. Of course the guy was looking for us. We were breaking and entering.”\n\nRay huffed, stilling himself, “Yeah but we didn’t break and enter into anything. We just sort of waltzed in.”\n\nRay steered the vehicle onto a main road, the same one and same direction we came from. \n\n“Exactly. Look, the guy was just doing his do diligence or whatever. I promise you, we are fine.”\n\nRay relaxed even more, worrying only a little, “What if he called the cops?” \n\n“Are we still there?” I asked.\n\nRay let out a deep sigh, “No.”\n\nWe drove home in relative silence, the radio turned up only slightly. Ray was wordless, tension in his bones leaking out of the marrow. \nI fetched the journal from my back pocket and began to study the content inside. Shiftless and lackadaisical, I thumbed through until I reached a section near the back of the notebook. A collection of pages, newspaper clippings and missing persons posters stapled or mod podged to each one. The clippings and posters spanned about five or so pages. \n\n“Yo, look at this. It’s a bunch of missing persons stuff.”\n\nRay’s eyes never left the road, “Didn’t your brother say something about people going missing?”\n\n“Yeah, but not like this.” I studied the posters with their blurbs of information. “This is extensive. It’s more than just one girl. It’s several people.” I felt like Biggie, I was beginning to get interested in what was really going on.\n\n“Let’s just save it for tomorrow, man. I don’t want to think about it anymore.”\n\nMy eyes roved about the words a little longer, then I shut the journal with a sigh, “Yeah. We can just show Biggie tomorrow.”\n\nThe drive home came and went. Stopped outside of the garage door, Ray’s slender fingers reached for a clicker attached to the drivers side sun visor. \n\n“Just pull off by the hose. I’ll spray off your car.”\n\nRay retorted, “Dude, I was just fucking with you.”\n\n“Eh. It’s fine.” I wasn’t sure how to tell Ray I wanted a moment to myself, time alone for my brain to process all that had occurred. “Just toss something in the oven when you get in. I’m starved.”\n\nRay parked the suburban beside the garage, hopped out and went inside the house. I shut the passenger door behind me and approached a long green snakelike coil that sat beside the home. I lurched over for the sprayer on the end of the rubber hose then lurched again to turn the water on. I twisted the crank until water sprayed like a mist on my hand from the faulty set up. Pulling the trigger, I sprayed the thirsty grass to see if the pressure was decent enough for a halfassed car wash. \n\nI approached the suburban but stopped, catching a glimpse of something unnerving. Handprints. \nThey were on the passenger side, driver side, rear windshield, and on every dust-covered window of the car. They were cupped, as if whoever they belonged to were attempting to peer into the vehicle. On the passenger side I could make out a little oily dot in the center of the handprints, no doubt from a nose. The handprints were wide, far bigger than mine or Ray’s. They had to have belonged to the man that was looking for us. They had to have, we made no other stops and no one else had been around us that day.\nI studied the handprints a little while longer then pulled the trigger and sprayed them off."},"334":{"title":"Slender Man: Unmasked ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fknhkk\/slender_man_unmasked\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Phantom_Specters","selftext":"I thought some people on here may enjoy this video.

Es un dolor clavado, una estaca al corazón. Un llorar para nada, una canción mal cantada,\n\nque mirada bien mirada, no es ni siquiera canción...\n\nEl amor es la mentira capaz de convencer a cualquiera. Es una primavera, con las flores al revés. Un jarabe de palo, tan catastrófico y malo, que te hace un nudo en el\n\nnabo para el que venga después.\n\nPero sin el, no sabemos vivir, no sabemos estar ni tampoco ir. Es un pensamiento criminal que se clava en lo mas profundo de nuestro ser, si lo sabemos manejar bien,\n\ny si no resulta fatal.\n\nUn enamorado perdido cayo en los lazos de una mujer en su dorada juventud. Sus ojos, teñidos con colores rosados por el estado en el que se encontraba, la veían como\n\nuna diosa en la tierra y como una divina estatua de Grecia traída a la vida. Esta visión sobre la doncella era una buena señal pues el alma del enamorado no estaba\n\nmanchada por la roña de varias costumbres generacionales como el prostituir el valor del ser humano al estar cambiando de dama por cada noche, o el incluso pagar por\n\nunos servicios manchados por el trauma y la amargura y muchas otras costumbres normalizadas a día de hoy.... Pero por desgracia todo esto no era correspondido.\n\nSi alguna vez te dicen que los hombres son unos mezquinos en cuanto al amor se refiere…. No se equivocan en realidad. Pero que no te engañen: Mientras que es cierto que el hombre tiende a diario ser cruel con el amor del prójimo de variadas maneras, por desgracia la mujer también le sigue los pasos y puede hasta ser mas dolorosa y venenosa que el propio hombre.\n\nLa doncella del enamorado no es que fuera el diablo en persona o nada parecido, pero en cuanto al amor se refiere no era una santa: Ademas del enamorado, otros hombres pasaban por su alcoba y se entregaba al deseo carnal sin pena ni vergüenza…. Al fin y al cabo, Dios creo el sexo desenfrenado para disfrutarlo, cierto?\n\nLa tragedia aterrizo en las carnes del enamorado cuando eventualmente logro encontrar a su adorada diosa entregada a otro hombre en la misma cama que ambos tenían, la mujer miraba con sorpresa a su pareja y con un obvio temor falsificado se dirigió a este para intentar aliviar su sorpresa y crear una excusa de porque estaban en la posición en la que estaban. El enamorado sin querer estar en aquella habitación por mas tiempo, salio disparado hacia la puerta y huyo de aquel lugar para nunca regresar.\n\nDecir que ella se sintió mal por lo que hizo seria una verdad a medias, pues cierto era que sentía cierto mal estar por haberle hecho daño a una persona que se le veía que era buena, al contrario que (por desgracia) muchos hombres que solo se preocupan por mojar el churro con cuantas mujeres puedan y exponerlo al mundo para rellenar un hueco en sus almas que muy difícilmente seria llenados. Pero por otro lado, no existía el suficiente dolor en su alma como para sentir arrepentimiento y acto seguido actuar en consecuencia para sanar el dolor o al menos hacer el intento de no volver a provocarlo a otra persona.\n\nEl tiempo paso y lo único que se sabia del hombre es que el estaba destrozado…. Por fin había encontrado su alma gemela y fíjese usted como fue pagado por el destino y el libre albedrío de la muchacha. La situación empeoro en gran medida cuando la horrible noticia de su suicidio es hizo eco por toda la ciudad.\n\nPese a que sus acciones la pintaron como una mala persona, esta lloro sin consuelo al saber lo que había provocado y fue ahí cuando sintió remordimiento y arrepentimiento. Pese al dolor que sentía, se propuso cambiar su forma de vida pues no quería que todo esto se volviera a repetir, pero por mucho que ella hiciera había una cosa que todavía no había hecho: Ir a la tumba del enamorado.\n\nDebido al remordimiento de sus acciones pasadas, no pudo ir en ningún momento a la tumba de quien fue una vez su pareja porque no se sentía siquiera digna de estar cerca del cementerio en si, mas ella no era conocedora de lo que le ocurriría por no hacer tal cosa.\n\nUna noche cualquiera seria testigo de una gran tragedia que sacudiría la ciudad entera. La mujer se encontraba en su casa tomándose una ducha cuando algo entro de manera sigilosa por la puerta.\n\nElla se puso una ropa cómoda para la noche y se estaba secando el pelo con una toalla para cuando escucho por fin un ruido extraño en el salón. Confundida y algo asustada de que pudiese ser un ladrón, se acerco poco a poco al salón con una lampara en la mano para así encontrarse con la nada misma, el salón estaba tal cual ella lo había dejado.\n\nCon un suspiro de alivio se dio la vuelta para regresar a su dormitorio, pero tal fue el susto cuando lo vio que la lampara cayo al suelo, rompiéndose en mil pedazos: Un ser similar al hombre enamorado, pero sin un ápice de su antigua humanidad.\n\nSu piel era de un tono azulado casi negro. Tenia pelo corto y poseía unos brazos, piernas y una cola de hierro rojo como la sangre. La señora, atemorizada por lo que estaba viendo, salio corriendo lo mas rápido que pudo de su propio hogar, siendo perseguida por aquella criatura que como una sombra la perseguía por todas partes con una gran velocidad.\n\nSalio de la casa y se dispuso a recorrer las calles de la ciudad mientras gritaba a pleno pulmón por ayuda, pero como si estuviese en un universo paralelo: La ciudad estaba totalmente vaciá.\n\nCon la mente yendo a mil por hora, pensaba de todo mientras oía a la bestia rugir detrás suya, y en un momento dado se le vino a la cabeza aquello que la podría salvar: El cementerio.\n\nSe dirigió hacia aquel campo santo de los muertos y busco con desesperación la tumba de su antigua pareja mientras que ese ser la estaba buscando con hambre. Al final consiguió encontrar aquella lapida y con destrozo se lanzo sobre ella para llorar riachuelos de lagrimas de amargura.\n\nPensó que al hacer eso, al haber ido al único sitio en el universo que se veía incapaz de ir, se había salvado de aquella criatura, mas eso no era mas que una pequeña llama de esperanza que se apago por los vientos del sur. Con un gran estruendo, la criatura aterrizo detrás de ella y la miro constantemente con sus ojos dorados como la miel….\n\nLas noticias estaban que ardían al amanecer del día siguiente: Un grito afónico trono por toda la ciudad y alarmo a todos los ciudadanos. Con intriga, extrañeza y esa frialdad que solo la televisión podía brindar, se televiso la noticia de que una mujer había sido asesinada, con un gran boquete en el pecho y con la notable ausencia de su corazón, **su adorable corazón….**"},"336":{"title":"My daughters were missing for 3 years before I got closure.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fkelyh\/my_daughters_were_missing_for_3_years_before_i\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"OliviaAtk","selftext":"Following the loss of my husband to complications with a brain tumor I found myself becoming what I viewed as a worse father, I was too deep in my grief to attend to the grief and needs of my daughters. I thought it best to take a weekend to myself to tackle my own problems so I can be more present, so I called my older brother Oscar and his wife Lilian and nearly begged them to watch the girls for a few days, they obviously were happy to. They picked them up later that day and I got to my process of healing (getting very drunk and staying in bed mostly).\n\nWhen Monday came I got my shit together as best I could and waited for my brother to drop them off, I was prepared to help them work through whatever they needed. as the hours ticked by without them showing I began to worry, I called my brother's phone probably 50 times, his stupid voicemail message became the soundtrack to my panic. \"You've reached Oscar Fordeat, leave a message after the Forbeep!\" played out into the echoing walls of my house as I paced the halls. When the sun went down and I began to dial the police a knock on my front door made me nearly jump out of skin, It was Lily, she looked very distraught, what I'm sure was mirrored thought she had upon seeing me.\n\n\"Dean...\"\n\nShe looked me up and down, \"He didn't show up did he..?\" we filed a missing persons report for Oscar and the girls before the night was over, they weren't found. I obviously could not accept that the police stopped looking after a few months so I began searching on my own, often but not always with Lily's help, in a few weeks I had combed the woods around the school the girls attended and Oscar's house leaving no stone unturned. by this point the people in my town that I had know my whole life had moved on with their lives and stopped dropping by to check on me so I spent most days alone. one night as I sat awake on my bed far too late to be awake something struck my mind that baffled me as to why I hadn't thought of it already, My brother's last worksite! He did freelance construction and was assembling a modular home out in the woods, the police had briefly looked over the place but what about the woods surrounding it!\n\nAgainst my better judgment I began to get dressed and look for my car keys, I should have waited until morning but I was so determined to find anything, even a mild clue as to where they had went. I called Lily and asked her for the address and she groggily gave it to me and I was on the way. when I arrived I used the flashlight on my phone to get a look around, part of the modular was collapsed at the back but I wasn't concerned with that, the police had probably checked that out already, I was more concerned with the woods. I made my way to the tree line, I could see from a distance there was a steep drop off just beyond it, as I got closer I could feel my ankle roll on top of loose dirt and I fell forward and down the drop off. I don't remember a lot after that, I remember unbearable pain, I remember waking up in the hospital the next day with Lily at my side.\n\nI had hit my back just right during the fall to paralyze myself from the waist down, but I honestly didn't care, not like I had much to live for anymore anyway. Instead my mind stayed focused on that loose dirt, I couldn't explain why I was so fixated on it, it just felt important. with the new limitations of my wheelchair I could hardly make it past my front yard let alone to the site, not on my town's dirt roads. after a week or 2 of pestering I finally convinced Lily to go search the area, it was raining hard that day, of course it was. all the ground would be soft and muddy, just as I expected she came back with nothing, I thanked her anyway and it continued to eat away at me for days, which became weeks, then months and years. by the 3 year mark I was basically just doing what was required to survive, I would eat, I would sit for hours, then sleep to start over. Lily had all but stopped talking to me by this point, my fixation was 'stunting her grieving process' so I respected her boundaries and lost her number.\n\nI had boosted myself out of chair and into bed same as any other night, just as I had began to dream I heard a soft sobbing beside my bed, I opened my eyes to see a silhouette, hunched over crying into it's hands. I quickly flicked on my bedside lamp and the figure shot it's head up as it was bathed in the light, it's mouth hung open and it's eyes open wide as if staring into the eyes of god. It was my brother, he looked different, his thick but short trimmed neat blond hair and well groomed Walrus mustache had been replaced with a dirty raggedy mop of shoulder length hair and similarly filthy full beard, his tattered clothes were covered in blood as was most of his face. \"Oscar..?\" I muttered,\n\n\"I- I'm... so sorry..\"\n\nHis voice was rough and rashly as if those were the first words he'd spoken in a long time. before I could process anything he lunged at me, wrestling me to the other side of my queen, his fingernails dug into my throat like an animals claws as he choked me, I mustered all my strength to punch him in the jaw with crack. I pushed him off of me and the bed as he clutched his face and groaned, I crawled as quickly as I could, tracking blood on my sheets to the other side of the bed and off to the ground beside my chair, I struggled with the footrest of my chair, pulling it off it's hinge and wielding it like a small bat. he cam barreling clumsily across the bed and towards me, right when he got close enough I cracked the footrest hard against his temple and he fell limp on top of me. I pushed him off with much effort and this rage boiled up inside me, this unbearable hot anger in my chest, I bashed the footrest into his face again, and another time, \"WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN?!!\" I screamed as I hit him again and again in the face and chest. after I caught myself and stopped battering him I threw the footrest and crawled to my nightstand, I called the police.\n\nWhen the police arrived they told me to my surprise, that I hadn't killed him, and they took him in. 2 days later an officer arrived at my house and told me that Oscar had confessed to what I'm going to tell you now: 3 years ago, on the Monday that Oscar was suppose to return my daughters, he picked them up from school and took them to his worksite to give me a few extra hours. the modular collapsed on the 3 of them, Oscar was mostly unharmed, but the girls.... they were crushed and contorted, Delilah was still half alive, writhing when he pulled them out of the wreckage, he panicked, and decided to put her out of her misery, terrified to face Lily and I after what he had done, he buried them by the tree line and fled a few states away. after 3 years of his mind stewing in it's own guilt made him paranoid and unstable, he returned to tie up loose ends. he killed Lily in her sleep and then came to my house to do the same to me.\n\n Alice and Delilah, my beautiful girls, rest easy, and please forgive me.

It was late November of 2004. I was nineteen years old. I had just graduated the summer before and had been floating from day to day since then adrift and devoid of any ambition or direction. I spent most of my time listlessly flipping through magazines with the same shitty informercials burning into the back of my brain like cigarettes buds in a bedsheet. I blanketed the nothing of my days with the same CDs, changing up the rotation very rarely.\n\nAt that point in time, life for me was very drab. I had been sad and stagnant for several months. The only thing that ever roused me out of my nothingness was visiting what few friends I had or rummaging through my older brother’s stuff, sometimes both. That day, the latter seemed to be the perfect antidote for the aimless teenage monotony I seemed to suffer from.\n\nAn acre away from my mother’s farmhouse sat an old red barn rusted and rotting in stretches of rolling green fields. Clods of clay stuck to everything inside, tools hung from its every wall, and heaps of boxes. There were heaps and heaps of boxes, stacks of four and five. Boxes were everywhere in this barn, towered and arranged like a makeshift maze. My older brother had filled majority of these with all kinds of stuff before he moved out.\n\nThat day just as any other that I took to rummaging, I shuffled the totes around long enough for dirt to float high into the air then cascade back down like snow. Which is when I happened upon a box marked ‘Derrick’s Keepsakes’.\n“Score.” I thought to myself.\nI had sorted through much of his things by now but every now and again I’d find something I hadn’t already gone through. I slid the tote away from the others and pried open the thick plastic lid. Like an archaeologist diligent not to break or misplace anything, I sorted through its contents with care. Admittedly, the container had some really cool stuff in it: magazines, tablature, vhs’ with god-knows-what taped over them, a few n64 and snes games, and what I had regarded that day as the greatest find—— a pleather binder chockfull of CDs.\n“Double score.” I thought to myself.\nThe binder was coated in clay and cobwebs much like everything else in the barn. I did my best to wipe it off with my shirt before I unzipped the binder and looked at the inside. It was full. Not an empty slot.\n\nThe CDs inside weren’t anything out of the ordinary. Some classics. Some not-so-classics. One or two movie soundtracks. A few albums I wanted for my collection. And several blank discs. \nUnder the vast blue sky and alongside its brisk breezes that stirred the trees, I made the acre trek back to my mother’s house. I thumbed through the CD wallet again and again. The blank discs excited me. A few of them were labeled in sharpie, most weren’t. Even then, the labels were cryptic references to inside jokes and phrases I was not privy to. Anything could be on them. Ripped albums. Home-brewed musical endeavors. A now defunct local bands’ attempt at leaving a dent in the music industry. Anything.\nI can recall my brother burning CDs and gifting them to friends and vice versa but I can’t ever remember what he was burning onto them. \n\nInside my room, I sat the binder on the end table beside my bed. The only other things on it were a small stack of magazines and a CD player that doubled as an alarm clock. I ejected whatever had been in the CD playing alarm clock and returned to its case. I unzipped the binder and began to thumb through the blank discs. ‘FRYKONDULA’. The scrawling on the CD stared back at me. \n“What an interesting string of letters.”\nI had no idea what it meant, still don’t. But it hooked me, deep. Curiosity sunk her claws into me and demanded the CDs sounds be heard.\n\nIt was goddamn bizarre. Even the most eclectic pieces of art have semblances of cohesion. Not this, this was a little different.\nThe production was godawful. It sounded like a recording of a recording of a recording.\nAs for the music, some tracks were paced like most grunge songs, i.e. clean verse, distorted or screamy chorus, repeat. However, the screamier parts sounded horrible, not that the singer was a bad vocalist but it sounded tortured—— he sound tortured. Every other track was like eavesdropping on a mental breakdown. Contrarily, the verses were really nice, there were two or three voices stacked on top of each other reading spoken word. Virtually impossible to make out.\nThe instrumentation was average. Interestingly, no matter the song, the drum tracks were always backwards.\nThe songs that were not at all paced like typically radio play were strange beyond description. I’m not sure if it was an attempt at being artsy or what. They were painfully quiet. Feet could be heard shuffling in an echoey place. On one track, a man could be heard answering questions with a horribly distorted voice. On another, what sounded like a swarm of locust infected with dial-up tones assaulted the listener.\n\nNone of it made sense and I’m not sure it ever will. In that moment however, I tried to make it make sense. Thoughts spiraled in my brain like the last bit of water draining out of a tub, circling and circling and circling. The two most distinct thoughts were, “What is this,” and “I should show Ray.”\n\nI went to the kitchen and snatched the phone from the counter.\nRay was my best friend at that point in time, he had been since sophomore year. He was the only other person I knew who had seemed to love music as much as I did. While his audio-obsession wasn’t near as extensive or expensive as mine, I knew he’d get a kick out of my discovery. He might even know what to make of what I had heard and what he would soon come to hear.\nI dialed Ray’s cellphone. Then waited. Then waited.\nThen, “Yo.” \nHe answered the phone with a yawn. It was just before noon, he had probably just woke up or was going to.\n“Yo Ray.”\n“What’s up, man?” He replied in a dry tired tone.\n“Dude, you gotta see this CD I found.”\n“Oh word?”\nI could hear him thumbing away at some game controller in the background. It distracted him. Preoccupation was nestled comfortably in his scratchy cadence. \n“Word. I found it when I was going through some of my brothers old shit. I don’t have the car today. You think you could pick me up?”\nThe statement seemed to wake him up a bit, “Wait, why don’t you have the car?”\n“My mom borrowed it cuz hers was in the shop.”\nRay responded with a soft, “Oh okay.”\nHe paused for a moment. He was looking for an excuse not to make the six minute drive to my house.\n“Ray, you live right down the road from me.”\n“I’m in the middle of a game, bro.” He said it almost as if it were a responsibility he had to attend to. “You think you could bike here?”\nI relented, “I mean, yeah.”\nHe paused again. I assume, distracted entirely and focused on the game.\n“See you in thirty.”\nI hung up the phone with a sigh, mentally preparing myself for the dreary bike ride to Ray’s house.\nI packed my bag then left a note on the kitchen table. It read: ‘Hey mom! Went to Ray’s—— if you need me you know who to call. Love you!’\n\n**Ray**\nPast hayfields, past dying oaks, past endless webs of barbed wire, I rode up the dirt road to Ray’s house. I tapped on the window to his bedroom before sliding it open and crawling in. He gave me a dismissive ‘wazzzzuup’, a ceaseless gaze fixed to the TV’s screen. \n\nThe room reeked of cigarettes, weed, and unwashed young man. It was terribly messy. Ray’s closet was the floor. Every available surface was crowded with empty cans, magazines, CD cases, amongst other things.\nRay’s lean frame was sprawled out on the couch, controller in hand. He was wearing long cargo shorts and a band tee two sizes too big. He likely hadn’t changed in a few days. Ray was remarkably handsome. Auburn hair, chiseled features, the occasional piercing. He belonged in a movie, one about some disillusioned surfer bro trying to make it big or find his way in life. I could be wrong. It is possible that Ray was average looking. It is possible that at this point of my life I had such bad luck with girls that I had given up ever dating one and was beginning to consider the alternative. I was never too sure.\n\n“Ray, how long have you been playing Halo? You haven’t put it down since you bought it.”\nThe tall figure sat up a bit and turned slightly to address me. His eyes never leaving the screen.\n“Bro, it’s fucking fun! We need to get you an Xbox so we can play together.”\nHe wiped his face with his shirt. For a guy whose diet consisted entirely of pizza rolls and similarly greasy foods, his skin was always so clear. \n“I can’t really afford that right now. And you know that my mom would freak if I saved up just for an Xbox.”\nHe scratched around his eyebrow piercing, impatiently waiting to respawn.\n“Yeah but still, dude.”\n“Not to mention, I don’t find getting bitched at in broken English as fun as you do.”\nI tossed my bag on the ground then sat on the couch next to him, forcing him sit up even more and to fix his posture. I reached over to the TV stand, grabbed an ash tray and set it on the arm of the couch. \nI fished for a pack of cigarettes in my pocket until Ray pointed his foot to a pack on the ground. I pulled a cigarette from the pack, tucked it between my lips and began to smoke. Vapor like incense swirled and hit the ceiling. \n\n“I take it you’ve been doing this all day.”\n“Yup, I just got up.” Ray seemed concentrated on the game.\nI couldn’t understand the fascination. Video games were a lot of fun in the company of friends, but alone? I couldn’t fault Ray though. What else were we going to do? Our small town afforded us little to nothing. It’s not like any of our other hobbies required much thought or effort.\nSmoke filled the air where a comfortable silence hung, occasionally broken up by the sound of in-game explosions and Ray swearing under his breath. He sucked at the game. That or the other players were just really good. Ray gestured for a drag of my cigarette, I held it to his lips and he inhaled deeply, blackening his flesh colored lungs. He exhaled.\n\nOnce spent, I put the cigarette out in the ash tray and stood up. \n“Yo, what was that thing you wanted to show me?” Ray said, still zeroed on the low poly super soldiers. \nI walked over to my bag and pulled the pleather binder out, flipped through until I found the ‘Frykondula’ Mix. I walked over to the stereo that sat next to Ray’s desk. Hit eject, opened the tray, then substituted whatever Ray was listening to before with the mystery CD.\n“You have to hear this.” I said. \nRay squeezed his hand in between the couch cushions for the remote, digging it out he pressed the rubber button that muted the TV. I hit play on the stereo.\n\nThe atmosphere thickened instantaneously. The life in Ray’s cold lightless room slowly bled out as the sounds of the wailing gibberish and backwards drum tracks took its place. I laid back on his bed staring at the ceiling letting the music wash over me for a second time. Ray sat up, alert and unsure but intrigued.\nThis time I could make out some of the lyrics, specifically the verses with spoken word: “...speak like a fool, call it defiance. several thoughts, a (book) full of ideas, no man was made to keep silent...\n...between a hundred rings the dying brow of the aborted furrows in quiet...\n...her mighty legs spread to save her heart. a quiet marriage, a man and woman, another ring...\n...and realize I need a cigarette when I think of summer’s end... fall is here, (I am undone)...”\nDespite picking up on some of what was being said it was still nonsense to me.\nWe continued to listen. Absorbing its absurdity, the silence and the shuffling and the sounds of moving around. An old man answering questions in the echoey place. Dissonance and wailing and whispering then quiet.\n\nRay broke the silence, “This reminds me of ween if ween sucked and was kind of unsettling and they were being cut with shards of glass.”\nI chuckled at the thought.\n“What else do you think about it?” I asked him.\n“It’s weird. It’s really fucking weird. Like I said, it’s probably someone’s like whackass-ween-wannabe band.”\n“Haha, I guess. It’s not just ween though. The wailing? I see what you mean, on the slower songs.”\nClarity struck Ray, derailing our analysis, “You know who would get a kick out of this?” He paused then said, “Big E.”\n\nBig E or Biggie was a friend of mine. He had a particular knack for the obscure and the obscene. Terribly fascinated by the unknown and paranormal, he spent a lot of his time during High School trying and failing to solve local mysteries. Now that we were out however, he only dabbled.\n“I mean, what else can we say about it? That it’s weird? E’s a bloodhound. He’ll be able find out way more than we ever could. This has E written all over it.” Ray stood up from the couch, tossed the controller on a mountain of laundry, then stretched. “And besides, I need to get out of the house. I haven’t seen the guy in forever.”\n\nI swung open the passenger door and loaded into Ray’s 1996 Chevy Suburban, he ignited the engine as I swung the door closed.\n\nThe drive to Biggie’s was the same as it always been. We used the dirt roads that snaked through the outskirts of town to get to a paved and far less bumpy main road. We’d coast into town, past the old baptist church, and into ‘suburbia’. It wasn’t really suburbia, these houses were just nicer than mine. Not to mention, the neighboring houses weren’t separated by acres of pasture. There were just a stone’s throw away.\nGarage doors open wide to expose ping-pong tables and CRTVs on work benches, tall windows revealed Tuscan interiors and stucco walls, at times you could catch a glimpse of deep baby blue pools with adjacent hot tubs in their backyards.\nIt was nothing like what I was used to, they always reminded me of the commercials. The kinds in which a twenty or thirty something year old guy in a bathrobe walks out of his house, down the sidewalk, and to the corner store to get a carton of milk. \n\n**Biggie**\nWe pulled into the circular driveway in front of E’s house, I opened the passenger door and studied the meek two story home. Ray went ahead of me and knocked on the door while I fetched my bag from the floorboard. Let in by his mother, we exchanged pleasantries and romped our way up to Biggie’s room and entered without a knock.\nBig E sat in front of a small TV, his pupils expanding now and again as they darted about the grey bulbous box of static. Bags under his eyes. He was playing Pokémon: Really Red or Super Purple or some shit. It’s likely he stayed up all night playing it. He had to have played that game at least a hundred times by now. I didn’t see the fun in it. Yuri, another one of our friends, sat next to E. He was wordless, soundless, watching E’s every in-game pixelated movement.\nAfter making our presence known, Yuri turned without E to acknowledge us. \n\n“Hey, Yuri. What’re you doing here?”\n“...”\nYuri didn’t say anything. He didn’t really ever say anything. He would wave, he would skate, he would game, he would laugh, but he wouldn’t say anything. On very rare occasions would he speak, when he did it always very low and monotone and dry. He raised his voice once. Him and E were playing something competitive. They were bitching at each other about needing another rematch for this or that reason.\n\nThere was a stirring in Big E’s bed. A tired groan sounded out from the mountain of blanket and pillow.\n“Samatha? What the fuck? You guys came over and didn’t tell us.”\nSamatha was another friend of ours. His birth name is the same as mine. In high school to avoid confusing the two of us, our friend group decided on a new name for him—— Samantha. Why we chose that name, I still don’t know. Ol’ Sammy put up a fight at first, but this really only guaranteed that we’d keep calling him by the new name.\nSamantha rolled around in E’s bed, lazily trying to find a way out of the heap of fabric he was under. In no real rush at all.\nMuffled, we could hear him say, “We called Ray but he didn’t pick up”\n“Ray!” I punched his arm, playfully.\n“Sorry, the Chief needed me.” Rubbing his arm and referring to the recent bought of binge gaming that seemed to disease him. \n“Whatever. We’re smoking. You joining us, E?” I shot a question at the hyperfixated Biggie. \n“Nah.”\nRay turned to the shape on the bed, “Sam, you want in?”\nSamantha grunted and rolled over, presumably going back to sleep. Without either of our asking, Yuri stood up solemnly, walked up to the window that led to the roof then opened it. Whether he said it or not, Yuri wanted in.\n\nStepping out of the window and onto the roof, we sat one beside the other on what felt like sand paper. We’d been up here so much that the shingles had lost most of their grit. It was a favored smoking spot for us—— the first and more frequented of the two being Ray’s bedroom. We had enough space on the roof to walk around, sit and lay down without fear of falling off.\nBiggie and I had a lot of interesting conversations up here. We’d look over the sleeping city. Late nights becoming early mornings, we would watch the city slowly rise out of its slumber, the sun gently waking the buildings. \nI always wanted something like this at my house. Somewhere to go. To escape. I was tired of bouncing between my friends places.\n\nRay handed over the goods to Yuri, a bag of ‘herb’, a pipe, and a lighter with a metal sleeve depicting several skulls engulfed in flame.\nYuri proceeded to pack the pipe without a word, slowly, carefully. It was almost reverent. For us it was reverent, a ceremony. Ray and I didn’t break the silence. \nYuri toked. Then passed it to Ray. \n“How long have you guys been here for?” I asked Yuri in a low tone, almost as to not ruin the mood that had been set.\nHe held up three fingers.\n“Including today?”\nHe nodded.\n“What’ve you guys been up to?”\nYuri gestured to the open window which could mean a few things. Video games, TV, browsing the internet, or getting stoned like there’s no tomorrow. Something exciting. Something boring. You just had to be there. You always had to be there. Otherwise you might miss it.\nRay interrupted with a cough. The kind that burns your esophagus. \n\nI waited for the fit to be over before asking, “Where are your folks this time?”\n“Fuck if I know. Cancun. Bahamas. Don’t really care.” Ray stared off at our small town, observing its humble skyline. The water tower, the concrete distillery.\nRay’s parents were never home. Ever since I’ve known the guy, I’d never once seen them in person. I knew it had to suck for him.\n“What a drag.” I murmured, an attempt at empathy.\n\nHe reached over to me with the pipe. Quietly, I took it. It was a small glass thing nestled in the palm of his slender hands. I took it and held it up to my mouth, pressed my lips against the pipe, lit the bud, and inhaled deeply. I loved the way good marijuana made me feel. Relaxed. Different. Good marijuana. Good friends. I had a sense that it wouldn’t last forever, or much longer for that matter. That we’d have to leave this all behind us. Grow up, get big. Quit ‘fucking around’ and focus on ‘what matters’, whatever the hell that meant. \nI let this go, the idea of change and the unneeded anxiety that came with it. I turned my eyes towards the skyline and observed with the others. Allowing the high to work its way from my lungs to my brain.\n\nI passed the pipe to Yuri and began to melt into the roof. We passed it back and forth, lips to lips, until the window slid open and another joined us. Samantha.\n“Morning.” Sam said in a cardboard tone.\nRay immediately retorted, “Morning? It’s nearly two in the afternoon.” \nRay was no better, if you let him he could sleep the day away. \nAs Ray passed the pipe off to me he wheezed out, “I never asked, what do you think the CD meant?”\nI responded, “Oh man. I don’t know. I’ve never heard anything like it. Could be a band or something my brother had been a part of.”\n“What is it?” Sam rubbed his eyes. \n“It’s just this CD mixtape thing I found. I found it in the barn with some of my brothers old stuff. It’s called ‘Frykondula’ or something.”\nSamantha yawned, “What was the name again?” He stretched, wringing the sleep out of his bones.  \nI repeated, “Frykondula.”\n“That sounds so familiar.” Samantha thumbed about the files in the proverbial vault, his fingers reaching for the pipe. Attempting to break and broaden the rotation. \n“We’re out.” Ray said.\nWe all sat in silence. The high had my body sinking further into the roof, I felt heavy. Like stone. Everything seemed to pass me by in that moment. \n\n“Frykondula. Isn’t that the guy who is like super screamy? Not like Pantera or Korn but like... he sounds like he’s freaking out or some shit?” Sam said, recognition in his cadence.\n“Yeah.” I said.\n“Really weird?” He asked.\n“Yeah, yeah. Like super cryptic and shit.” \n“Uh huh. I think I know him. If it’s who I think it is, I caught him at a show a long ass time ago when I first started going to shows. I should have a CD of his.” Samantha stretched and grunted. Then continued speaking through a yawn,\n“I had to have been like fifteen or so. It was at the Bunker, that old basement venue. But the guy was weird as fuck. If I remember correctly he like vanished off the face of earth or some shit. Ran off with some chick. People were talking about it for a while.” Sam paused, rifling through his dirty blonde hair. \n“One thing I do remember clearly though, a while after his first few shows he started hunting down the CDs that he sold asking for ‘em back. People who bought them said he was hellbent on getting them back. He’d pay double or even triple for them. Asked me for my copy. I told him I had lost it. It was weird. Getting them back seemed important to him, I guess.”\nCurious, I asked, “Why? I mean he sold them? What was so important that he had to have them back?”\n“No idea.” Sam didn’t reciprocate the intrigue.\nHe seldom did. Samantha was so much of a realist it bordered on pessimism. If he couldn’t rationalize something, he criticized it and those who could.\nI continued questioning, “Do you remember what his set was like? Like when you saw him preform.”\n“Not really. Nothing out of the ordinary. Super screamy scrawny guy trying to leave some sort of mark on the world.”\n“Do you know if my brother was there? Was he a part of the band or anything like that?”\n“No. Not that I remember.” Samantha said.\nWe all sat in silence for a moment. I had no more questions, not right then. Eyeing ‘suburbia’ from the rooftop with the others I wondered about the CD.\n\nSam piped up, “You should call your brother.”\n“Eh.” Internally shrugging off the suggestion.\n“I mean it’s his CD. Maybe the guy confronted him about needing it back.”\n“Yeah, you’re probably right.” I said, wincing on the inside.\nThe thought of calling my brother was almost as difficult as living with my mother. Not knowing what else to say, I didn’t say anything.\n“He’ll probably have more to say than I do.” Samantha added. \n“I know.” I tried to brush off the awkwardness and move on with the conversation. “I’ll call him later. I brought the CD with me if you want to hear it, I was gunna show Big E.”\n“Then let’s have it, broski.” Sam stood up on the shingles and stretched for the final time that afternoon. \n\nYuri slid open the window and we all filed in behind him. \nBack inside of E’s room, I fetched the CD wallet from my bag, then flipped through until I found the disc marked ‘Frykondula’. I walked over to the stereo that sat on Biggie’s desk. Hit eject, opened the tray, then substituted whatever E was listening to before with the mystery CD.\nRay stood behind E and aggressively massaged his shoulders, trying to rip him away from his game with the playful distraction.\n“Alright. Pause your game and listen to this.” Ray commanded the slouching E. \nBiggie squirmed out of his grasp, “Okay, okay! I’m listening.”\n\nE paused the game and tossed the controller aside. I hit play, adjusting the volume as guitar feedback announced the beginning of our listening experience. Again, the obscene sounds stole our breath and our words. No matter how many times I had to endure listening to the CD, I couldn’t bring myself to speak over the ‘music’. \nA few tracks in and during a transition, Biggie said under his breath, “What am I listening to?”\n“Just some local jagoff.” Samantha placidly stated from the top of a double decker couch. \n“Wait you know this guy.” E turned to face him.\nSam replied, “I know of him. I’ve been to a show or two.”\n“Yeah, tell him about how he tried recalling the album.” Ray added.\n“Oh,” Sam sounding uninterested, “The guy went crazy and tried getting his mixes back before he disappeared with some bitch.”\nThe spear of Intrigue stuck Big E in the side, sitting up and addressing a lounging Samantha, “What do you mean ‘went crazy’”\n“I don’t fucking remember. This happened like four years ago.” Sam said, angst bleeding into his demeanor. \n“He ran off?” E pressed him further.\n“I think so. I don’t know, people talk. Some said he killed the girl he was with. Some said he just ran off with her. I really don’t remember.” Perhaps done with the conversation, Sam continued to feign ignorance.\n“What do you mean you don’t remember?” E unhindered continued to grill him.\n\nSamantha and Biggie began to clash, which wasn’t unusual for the two. Between Sam’s apathy and E’s curiosity, the push and pull of their conversation could last all day if no one were there to mediate. One scratching desperately at an insatiable itch. The other content not to scratch at all. The fact that Samantha was the only one of us who had any information about the CD would have been hilarious if the two weren’t prone to argue.\n“Oh, here we fucking go. Dude I don’t remember.” He threw his hands up.\n“Someone was killed and you don’t remember?” The other leaned into his words.\n“People said she was killed. That’s not a fact.” Samantha began to sit up a bit.\n“But it has to be based on some sort of truth though.” \nSam snapped at Biggie, “No it really fucking doesn’t.” \nI interjected, “Samantha, step off.”\n“Oh, were you guys not there?” Subtle agitation in Sam’s question. “The time that he brought over this like fucking cowboy rifle that he swore could turn off TVs by itself.”\n“Oh word?” I inquired, never having heard this story. \nE tried to defend himself, “It did though.”\n“No, it fucking didn’t.” Sam barked back. “That shit is so easy to explain away. Faulty wiring, the electricity being weird, the TV being weird. Just because it happened with the rifle in the room means jack fucking shit. Not to mention it happened with only you in the room. You could’ve made the whole thing up.” Samantha continued, “Or or or what about the time we went looking for crystals or martians or whatever the fuck at that abandoned hospital?”\nRay began to say something but was promptly cut off. “Watch him, he’s gunna somehow connect this to a crime syndicate or the mafia or some shit and I don’t know about you guys but I don’t really feel like wasting my time on crackpot theories and wild goose chases.” \nBig E finally responded, “Man, I just asked a question.”\n“You’re asking questions now but I promise you, you are going to work yourself up and everyone around you over nothing.”\nI chimed in, aiming to end the dispute and placate both parties, “It’s my brother’s CD. I’ll just call him and ask him about it. You obviously don’t want to answer questions, we won’t ask you questions. Just drop it, you two.”\nE began to interrogate me now, “Wait. Why did your brother get to keep a copy of the CD but no one else could? Was he a part of the project?”\n“I really don’t know, I’m gunna call him as soon I get to Ray’s.” \nWith that the tension subsided some but wouldn’t completely vanish until we became preoccupied with something other than Frykondula.\n\nRay and I spent most of the remaining day at E’s. When it came time to leave a wordless lull washed over some of us. Sobered up and socially drained, Ray and I took our leave and rode home quiet. \nWe passed through the familiar sights on our way back to Ray’s house. The pools and two car garages of ‘suburbia’, the lots and the alleys of our small sleepy southern Baptist town that wouldn’t know for gentrification for another two decades, and lastly the long dreary dirt roads and vacant pastures just outside of town.\n\nSomewhere between the parking lots and empty hay fields, Ray broke the silence with a question, “What’d you think of what Samantha had to say? About that girl going missing and all.”\nI opened with a sigh, “Eh, I don’t know. It’s an interesting thought but I sort of agree with Sam. Everyone might be getting worked up over nothing.”\n“You don’t think that Frykon-whatever guy killed her? “\n“Not really.” I replied, “I mean, wouldn’t we have heard about it. Small towns love to gossip.”\n“Sam said it happened like four or five years ago. Maybe that’s why we don’t know about it.” \nRay seemed genuinely unsure. He wasn’t trying get to the bottom of anything. He just didn’t know what to think right then and there.\nI tried to reassure him. “Four or five years ago we were freshman, that or late into the eighth grade. Either way we would’ve heard about it. Someone would have told us.”\n\n**Derrick**\nRay’s garage door rumbled open with chains, pulleys, and a mechanical whirring. He parked his suburban and clamored inside anxious to return to the squalor he called ‘home’. I followed behind him but stopped midway to his room, I approached the bar in the kitchen.\n\n“My brother?”\nGod, I hated how touchy the subject was. Family. Ray seemed to me more like family than anyone I was related to by blood. Whether we admitted to it or said it aloud, he and I tried to be there for each other. A shoulder to lean on. Contrarily, my older brother was all but estranged. Despite not having to deal with our mother’s alcoholism and all that it carries with it, he always swore I had it better than him—— that I was freeloading, that I was taking advantage of my mother’s support. He left home just as our parents were discussing the terms of their divorce. Before the belligerence and the violence and the booze. Still, he swore I had it better. Despite how much that may have bothered me, I needed to know what my brother had to say about the mixtape. In some strange ‘next-of-kin’ kind of way, I also wanted to clear his name. Not to mention, it was about this time that I was ready to put it all behind me. To me, it really wasn’t that big of a deal. I was content believing that it was nothing more than someone’s ‘whackass-ween-wannabe band.’ I was completely fine with cataloging it alongside the other albums in my collection, not thinking twice about its history or its maker(s). For Biggie’s sake and to spare Samantha an onslaught of questions, I decided I would call my brother and leave it at that. To conclude whether the person behind Frykondula had any involvement with that girl disappearing or if it was just a coincidence. All I had to work with up until this point was hearsay from Samantha. I needed more information before I could write all of this off as some schoolyard rumor. \n\nI dialed Derrick’s cellphone. Then waited. Then waited.\nThen, “Who’s this?” A voice, grizzled and worn, spoke from the other side.\n“It’s your brother.” I replied very matter-of-factly.\n“My man! How you been?” He almost sounded excited to hear from me.\n“How’s the job hunt going?” He inquired, masking his need to know my financial status with real concern.\n“It’s going good.” I lied. “I’ve been filling applications and handing out my resume like crazy.”\n“Good to hear. What’d you call me for? Or were you just checking to see if your old bro kicked the can yet?” He chuckled. He thought he was so funny. \n“Yeah, that. So I was going through your old CDs and I found this really weird one called ‘Frykondula’, ring a bell?”\n“Oh man!” He bolstered knowingly, as if greeting an old friend. “That was Odor’s project. Yeah, I know it.”\n“Odor?” \n“Owen. You remember? Maybe not, he never came over. I hung around him a lot though.” He either sipped something or took a long drag from a cigarette before continuing. “Odor made a few of those back in high school. I think it was our junior year when he started. Maybe senior. Didn’t care to talk about it much.”\n“How’d you get one? Did he give it to you?”\n“Oh no. I stole that shit.” He began to laugh. Laughs becoming coughs. He cleared his throat, “He’d preform some of the music locally with a few friends of his. I attended a show one time. He sold them there primarily. But we were hanging out at his place and I just kinda took one.”\nWere Derrick telling the truth, it would make sense why this ‘Odor’ person didn’t harass my brother into giving back his copy of the album.\n\nWanting to know more, “What does it mean? I mean you’ve heard the music, did Odor or Owen or whatever tell you what it meant?”\n“Uh, I remember asking a couple times but he was pretty vague. Truthfully, he was a friend of a friend, I didn’t know him that well. We all just hung out at his place a few times even though the guy was sorta strange. He was a courtyard kid. Wrapped up in his little fantasyland. Practically documented everything in this notebook he carried around. It was kind of endearing.”\nI was reluctant to steal my brother from memory lane and despite not knowing how to approach it, I began to ask about the girl. “Was he involved in anything sketchy?”\n“Whatdya mean?” Derrick had no clue as to what I was insinuating.\n“Like someone going missing.”\nHe thought for a moment. “Oh, his little girlfriend. At least that’s what we called her. I don’t think they were official. Yeah, she was just as weird as him. Hung out all the time. Both went missing on a hiking trip. It happens.” He finished with a sigh.\n“Missing while hiking?” \n“Yeah, it happens more than you think. A few hotshot kids think they can brave the great outdoors despite lack of experience, food, and gear. Happens a lot.”\n“Did anyone go looking for them? Was this local?”\nDerrick scoffed, “No shit people went looking for them. And yeah, I think they were at Green Oak. That huge ass National Park west of here.” He huffed, “Look, I loved chatting with you bro but I gotta go. Kids are getting rowdy, bored, you know how it gets. If you’re that damn interested in the guy his folks are probably still at the same place.”\n“Which would be where?”\n“Very end of Pecan Avenue in Brookmore. It’s got the two magnolias out front. Can’t miss it. Oh, one last thing. Don’t be a stranger, kid. You know where I stay.”\nDial tone. He hung up the phone.\n\nWith that I returned the home phone to the dock on the kitchen counter and went to Ray’s room. I relayed everything my brother had said to Ray.\n“So now what?” \nI sighed, “I guess we go talk to his parents.” I plopped on the couch beside Ray who had been slouched over a controller. “He was just so nothing about the whole conversation. I’m not sure what else to do. I really just want to forget it and move on.”\n“It’s whatever, man.” Ray reassured me, “We’ll swing by his parents place, they’ll probably say the same shit your brother did, we’ll move on.”\n“Alright. Then that’s what we’ll do. First thing tomorrow.”"},"344":{"title":"Burnt Luigi (Post #2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk8q3q\/burnt_luigi_post_2\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"JosephTheSnail","selftext":"Ah, look at that, post #2. I recently found this blog thanks to my brother. I had a huge problem trying to record this for him, as he requested; apparently, he told me something about a story called “Burnt Luigi.\" Am I correct on that? It’s kind of a stupid name; why would you name a story that? Eh, I won’t care too much; he’s my brother anyway.\n\nFor a proper introduction to whoever is reading this post, my name is Joseph. I did not write the original post that was locked; my brother did. Recently, I got a hold of this post, so I’m writing it now. Well, enough dilly-dallying. You wanted a post about something creepy, right? Well, you’re probably going to get it now.\n\nIf you knew my work on the internet, you’d know I love writing and creating games as a little hobby, and I knew this was my opportunity. So, I gladly agreed to take over this blog that my brother was trying to write. One thing I noticed about this post is the use of bad grammar and such. (For those grammar checker experts who like correcting others’ grammar on the internet, my grammar is terrible too, but I’m sure it will be way better than my brother’s grammar, I tell you that.) Well, back to what I’m talking about: I recently stumbled across the ROM that my brother posted on the web.\n\nI thought it was a virus at first, but if it came from my brother, I had to trust him, right? And besides, it was Super Mario 64; how could I not? It’s definitely a favorite of mine, next to Super Mario World and Luigi’s Mansion on the Nintendo GameCube. Of course, you are expecting a bloody and totally scary mess out of this post, right? Well, I’m expecting to write about one too. Just stick with me; we will see together.\n\nAnyway, I started downloading the ROM, and judging by how I have Project 64, I could play this easily and record the thing, in case you think I’m lying. Either way, my way of recording things like this may seem like I’m just lying and writing a story to scare others. The ROM finally downloaded, and I was able to play it; though, I had to drag it into a folder with my other games, and luckily, it’s been converted into a Z64 file in the first place (heck yeah, I can play this now).\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qiie21SFxeE?si=aDHFzTetAltYr7Bs](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qiie21SFxeE?si=aDHFzTetAltYr7Bs)\n\nThe game started with Mario’s head, of course, like anyone would expect when they play this game. I decided to play around with Mario’s face, pulling on his ear, nose, you name it. I pressed start, and it took me straight to the selection screen.\n\nOne thing I noticed is the save folder from the time my brother was using this blog (it was refreshed to 1 star for some odd reason). I opened it and was met with something quite odd; it was a still frame of Mario in the basement, completely flooded with water. Of course, you know, it was in the original game anyway.\n\nLord, I was hoping I would have a day where I don’t mention anything creepy (something that children may find creepy only) in a post, but instead, I did. Basically, Mario was lying in the water, basically dead, not moving at all, still as a picture, and the water was reddish, mixed with blood. It would've been obvious anyway; it was playing Bowser’s laugh on repeat, and it got deeper at the last frame.\n\nHow long was this going to take? God knows how long, but it finally took me back to the selection screen. This time, the original save file (Mario A) had Mario’s head in the center of the gray square but with his eyes completely closed, and he’s puking red water out of his mouth. The HUD that had the stars and “new” text was completely gone; there’s no way I could open the save file back up; my only options were B, C, and D.\n\nI opened B, but the same thing happened, though. This time, it showed a close-up of the lava in Lethal Lava Land, and there was Luigi’s hand coming out of the lava. I don’t know why Luigi was in this, as he was never in Super Mario 64 in the first place, only when the game was still being worked on.\n\nFYI, he was found afterward after the “rumors” of him being in the game were spreading like wildfire.\n\nThere were also frames of Luigi; they weren’t very fast, so I could see them and describe them to you. It was a photo of Luigi, clearly edited and taken in-game; he was burned, and the photo was black and white, as if it were taken during the older days. His mustache was completely gone, as was his flesh, revealing his skeleton. His clothing was also torn, revealing some bone underneath. You can see this in the video as well, if you’re following along. Some things had to be cut because I wanted you to figure them out yourself or because I didn’t find them important enough.\n\nAs with the first save file, it took me straight to the file selection screen after a little while, now this time showing Luigi's burnt and disfigured look in the center of the gray box, though it got refreshed back to a new file.\n\nMy only options were C and D.\n\nI entered the “C” save file and prayed to God that it would grant me at least one game.\n\nIt didn't grant me a game, sadly, though instead of that, I got an in-game photo again. It turns out, my job was done in the first place; Bowser was destroyed, though he was decapitated. Who did it? Well, if you’ve been around since the first post, you would know that Luigi drowned Mario, and he might’ve been the one that killed Bowser.\n\nIt was playing the Big Boo’s Haunt theme (but deeper and slower for some reason) on repeat, and after a little while, it took me to the selection screen. Though the background was completely distorted and had Luigi’s face flashing on the screen, Bowser’s head was on the center of the buttons like Mario and Luigi, again not pressable, and my only option is D. I hoped for a game, or else I'm wasting my time.\n\nI pressed the final save file, and it was actually a game, though it took me directly to Bob-Omb Battlefield level, though the scene was dark and depressing, and there was the music that you would hear in Dire Dire Docks. The audio was peaceful, but it gave me an uncomfortable feeling of abandonment.\n\nWhat I meant by that is, do you remember what happened with King Bob-omb? He died, and the battlefield has been left to rot. I don't know who runs it now, but you will find out in this post.\n\nI climbed up the mountain, dodging the black balls going down the hills, and when I reached the top, my screen started glitching and going out of frame.\n\nThe man on top was indeed green, burnt, and fleshless.\n\nIt was Luigi.\n\nWhen I saw him and approached, my screen got darker and darker, then flashes of the Luigi picture again started appearing faster and faster.\n\nRandomly, there was a video of a man staring at me, overlaying the flashes of Luigi’s face. This wasn’t Shigeru Miyamoto or Charles Martinet, but this man who flashed on the screen was definitely an employee at Nintendo; how did I know that? He had a uniform on. I don’t know about this man yet, but he might have importance with this file and explain why this version of Super Mario 64 is the way it is.\n\nMy theory is that this man could be the one who added Luigi, but he did it in this way without Miyamoto’s knowledge. From what I’m thinking, he might’ve done this because Luigi was his favorite character, and he got angry over the fact that Nintendo didn’t add him to the game, so before launch, he broke into one of the copies and snuck it into my brother and my nearby GameStop that’s located in my Walmart submall (no, I don’t live at a store, I live in a town that I won’t give my address to).\n\nThough that’s my theory, it shouldn’t be true.\n\nI also forgot to mention the fact that my screen capture of the Bob-omb Battlefield broke, so you may only hear audio, though the beginning of the video where it shows the selection screen has been shown working perfectly; however, my screen capture usually flashes now and then when it happens, but in the recording, you may see some weird stuff. Let me know what you see.\n\nIn the video, you may also notice how choppy the video is. I apologize for that; my computer isn’t very good. Anyway, I can’t continue this post any longer. Before I end this post, this is being recorded with OBS Studio, which is something I’ve been using for a while.\n\nWell, please have a good day. I will continue this again in Post #3 if I ever find anything interesting. Oh wait, I’m getting a call from a curator on the Mario Amino. Let’s see here. It’s TakeASoda? I will answer this.\n\n—\n\nSorry, no video footage was recorded yet, and I don’t even want to know what happened to my game or what Luigi did to it (he might’ve damaged it; that green plumber). I recently felt my computer overheating at times, and on my desktop, I heard deeper laughs of Bowser playing on a loop and screams of Luigi burning in the lava in Lethal Lava Land.\n\nThough, even if I didn’t record any footage today, I wrote down some things that TakeASoda and I said on the Mario Amino:\n\nMe: Hello, what do you need, TakeASoda? Are you asking me about a post violation or something?\n\nTakeAsoda: No. It’s regarding your theory of the second post.\n\nMe: Please specify, please.\n\nTakeAsoda: Ok. So, you know how you came up with the fact of someone over at Nintendo getting angry at the fact Luigi wasn’t in Super Mario 64, right?\n\nMe: Ohhhh yeah, that, I remember now.\n\nTakeAsoda: Basically, it’s true; that employee literally threatened to kill everybody in Nintendo of America; someone I knew who worked at the company at the time told me about this, and he had to evacuate the building.\n\nMe: Did the deaths of Mario and Bowser mean to replicate anything relating to the threats?\n\nTakeAsoda: Yup. One time, he told me that the employee wanted to drown someone, and for another person, he wanted to decapitate them.\n\nMe: Oh wow, what was the employee’s name?\n\nTakeAsoda: His name is unknown, and he exclaimed himself Luigi for some reason. He had an obsession with Luigi for some strange reason.\n\nAfter that talk, TakeAsoda ended the call and sent me and other leaders and curators to a private chat together to discuss it with people like eeh1229, meph, odd.grump, and other admins of the community that I’m following.\n\nMe: Oh?\n\nTakeAsoda: Yeah, I created this private chat just now.\n\nLuigi joined the conversation.\n\nTakeAsoda: Wow, I didn’t invite him.\n\nMe: Yeah, where did this guy come from?\n\nMeph: Don’t disappoint Luigi.\n\nEeh1229: Don’t disappoint Luigi.\n\nOdd.Grump: Don’t disappoint Luigi.\n\nFYI: Those were the only people who said that message; other leaders and curators remained silent.\n\nMe: Wow, what the actual crap was that?\n\nMe: Don’t disappoint Luigi.\n\nMe: LUIGI SHUT UP! HOWEVER IS DOING THAT HAS TO STOP!\n\nTakeAsoda: I think it’s the Luigi user; someone has to kick him out.\n\nLuigi left the conversation.\n\nMe: Thank God...\n\nTakeAsoda: Yeah, who was that?\n\nMe: Ben?\n\nTakeAsoda: What? No. He didn't drown. Be serious, Joseph.\n\nMe: Ok, sorry, this is confusing and intriguing.\n\nBURNT Luigi joined the conversation.\n\nNotice how the user’s name has BURNT at the beginning of the text. How did this happen? I think the fact that I’m on Amino’s desktop site means the virus might’ve found its way into the browser; I don’t remember ROMs doing something like this.\n\nBURNT Luigi: I am Nintendo.\n\nBURNT Luigi: I am Nintendo.\n\nBURNT Luigi: I AM NINTENDO.\n\nMe: Uhhh… I think my computer has a virus.\n\nBURNT Luigi: I AM NINTENDO.\n\nBURNT Luigi: I AM NINTENDO.\n\nMe: LUIGI SHUT UP ALREADY!\n\nTakeAsoda: Uhh… Here, I will take care of this.\n\nBURNT Luigi left the conversation.\n\nTakeAsoda: There, I banned him from the chat, but judging how I couldn’t ban anyone from the community, I asked a leader on here to do it.\n\nMe: Good, thank you.\n\nI know, you guys might’ve been annoyed over how that user was giving off cringe dialog to us, and it sounded like something you heard from these types of stories. But I’m telling you right now, that’s what the user was saying to us, and yes, he was spamming that to us; he also private messaged us (even if some of our messages were turned off).\n\nThe same thing happened again; it literally felt like the endless staircase, but not in Super Mario 64; it was in an endless loop, and the user kept being banned but kept coming back when we didn’t invite him in the first place.\n\nBurnt Luigi joined the conversation.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Hello.\n\nMe: uhhh… hello?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Hello JosephTheSnail.\n\nMe: hi?\n\nMe: What do you want from me?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Do you want to see a photo of me?\n\nMe: Uhhh, why are you asking me? I guess.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Great! It was from our last meetup.\n\nMe: I’m sorry, WHAT?\n\nBurnt Luigi sends a picture, clearly photoshopping an old picture of me sitting on a log, and he’s holding my hand.\n\nMe: I’m sorry, I do not remember taking this photo with you.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Happy birthday! I heard your birthday is October 8th, correct?\n\nMe: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? DID YOU CHECK MY DISCORD TOO?\n\nBurnt Luigi: I have my reasons.\n\nTakeAsoda: I’m sorry, but what is this? OH, OH, no.\n\nMe: I know, right? What is this?\n\nBurnt Luigi: It’s just me. It's me, Luigi!\n\nMe: No, you’re not; you’re not Luigi.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Yes, I am; I’m Luigi.\n\nMe: No, you’re not. I know Luigi; he’s a hero in the real Mario games, and you’re something else.\n\nBurnt Luigi: But I’m a hero.\n\nTakeAsoda: You know what? That’s it; I’m deleting this chat.\n\nMe: Please do it; it can stop this.\n\nTakeAsoda then deleted the chat, and then Luigi, the one from the private chat, went on my wall and said that I wasn’t a fun person; luckily, he blocked me afterward, and I can officially have peace—well, at least for now.\n\nWell, my only option is to turn this computer off and go to sleep; maybe it will stop. Well, see you guys in the third post if I’m still around at the time I write this. Ah! I will be around (it’s not like this figure or game can hurt me); I just have other work to do, like school and the like."},"345":{"title":"It came from the trees (Part Five) ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fkc81m\/it_came_from_the_trees_part_five\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"WaluigiStan","selftext":"\n“Audrey, honey, I need you to tell me the truth ok?”\n\n“Ok, Grandma.”\n\n“Who are the happy people?” \n\n“The happy people who live in the woods!

On tonight's podcast one of my split personalities has a confession to make and us 3 personalities are going to listen to it. It's going to be one hell of a podcast show tonight. It's going to get heavy. I am the first and true original personality. \n\n2nd personality: You know you always seem to think that you are the main personality out of the rest of us. Also you are the only one with a name and the 3 of us got. What if you are not the main personality. It really got us talking and I wanted to see whether I was main original personality born from birth. So then I found an opportunity. I found a reddit post about a wife complaining about her husband and it really made me think that it was my wife. \n\n3rd personality: you know being the branch personality from a main original personality isn't so bad. Sometimes to just exist is enough for me and being the main personality isn't a priority to me. \n\n1st original personality: you know I am definitely the first and true personality that was born from birth and you lot are branches, it's just facts. \n\n4th personality: it's the cockiness of it all really and that you think you are better than us, for being the main original personality. We get it and you don't need to keep going on about it. \n\n2nd personality: any how back to my story, the reddit post sounded like my wife was writing about me. It described me in horrible ways but I wasn't ashamed, but rather I found it exciting. So I did more stuff to my wife and I then read about it later on reddit. I was excited rather than ashamed. \n\nThen I accidentally unalived my wife and I then found my dead wife writing about it on reddit. \n\n1st original personality: what the hell\n\n3rd personality: man what on earth!\n\n4th personality: dude for real\n\n1st original personality: I rush home because we all have the same wife and she hasn't been seen today or even picking up her phone.

Life never gave me the chance to be otherwise; I have stealed, scammed, lied, and yes: I have killed. This is my first, and probably last, confession I would make since I know now that my life is about to end.\n\nI was raised in El Salvador, where being born poor was a death sentence no matter where your life goes, either be part of organized crime or be a victim of it. I didn’t have parents; I didn’t have friends; I was alone most of my life. I’m not trying to excuse myself, because I know there is no excuse for all the things I’ve done.\n\nWith all that in the table, let me tell you about my encounter with El Cadejo. In our folklore, el Cadejo is a black dog created by the devil himself to give the damned souls a premature trip to the fiery pits of hell. I never believed it, why would I? Dogs aren’t typically scary; hell, I’ve had dogs, big dogs even, and none of them have ever frightened me. And yes, I’ve been bitten and scratched by dogs, every dog owner has been. How naïve I was.\n\nI was walking to my house, if you could call my small, rickety structure made of mismatched planks that way. It was nighttime, the weather was warm as usual for a tropical country, no clouds at all in the sky, I could see the stars decorating the dark canvas of the sky as my footsteps where the only sound I could make out during the quietness of midnight. I came back from a shitty day, with not a single cent to my name for food or water. When all of the sudden, as I was reflecting on how I came to that point in my life, a chill ran down my spine.\n\nHave you ever had the feeling of someone or something watching you? You probably had, now imagine it while you’re alone, down a path you have walked a million times, feeling as safe as someone who knows your road like the palm of your own hand. The sudden realization that I wasn’t safe at all, my legs started to tremble and my breathing got heavier, as if the air became thicker and impossibly hot.\n\nMy vision blurred as my hearing could capture a noise, an unfamiliar noise for the place. It sounded like a hoof, like the ones from goats, faintly but constant and approaching rapidly. When my sense of sight came to, I asked if someone was there, I screamed to the air, and no response at all. Then I saw it.\n\nIt emerged from the shadows, as if it was materializing from the night itself. Its eyes burned with an intense, blood-red glow that pierced through the darkness, its fur is matted and clinged to its gaunt frame, coated in shadows. A foul odor, like sulfur and decay, permeated the air around it, and its growls sounded like a chorus of anguished whispers. As it moved closer to me in seconds that felt like an eternity of suffering, the ground seemed to tremble faintly, as though the very earth recoiled from its presence. Its form is that of a massive dog, much larger than any ordinary pet, with a muscular yet unnervingly graceful build.\n\nJust when I thought I would collapse or even die under its gaze, it stopped. It didn't leap or lunge. It just... stood there, as if savoring my fear. My legs finally responded, and I stumbled back, almost tripping. My mind was a storm of terror, but something pushed me to take another step, then another. \n\nWith every step back I took, it followed, always staying just out of reach, but close enough for me to see it. I walked backward, eyes locked on its burning red gaze, refusing to turn away. My heart pounded painfully in my chest, my breaths shallow and rapid. It felt like hours, that slow retreat, my feet dragging over rocks and roots. The scent of decay clung to me, the echo of its growl lingering in my ears. \n\nI know the story, I know why it came to me; but what I don’t know is why, as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished. I stood there for a long moment, heart still hammering, legs trembling. The path ahead was empty now, but the memory of those glowing eyes burned in my mind. I had faced El Cadejo and survived. Why did I survive? God knows I don’t deserve it.\n\nWhen I finally made it back home, I just stayed there, standing, contemplating every single choice I’ve ever made. I want to say that the encounter gave me a new perspective on life and death, how I want to live and where will I go when I die; but I fear that no amount of self-reflection can help me, as I look out the window and see glowing, red eyes coming from a silhouette that appears to be a massive black dog."},"348":{"title":"The death of Deputy Tim Weller","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fki2jd\/the_death_of_deputy_tim_weller\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"ClammyWalnuts","selftext":"I never thought it’d happen here. Small town, middle of nowhere. The kind of place where folks leave their doors unlocked, and the worst we deal with is a drunk stumbling out of the bar after a bad day. But when the outbreak started… we were just as screwed as anywhere else.\n\nThe bite is deeper than I thought. She got me good. A girl—couldn’t have been more than sixteen, her face half gone, but she was fast. I didn't see her in time. One minute I was clearing the street, barking orders to get people inside, and the next she was on me, teeth sinking into my arm. I put her down, but the damage was already done.\n\nThe bite burns like fire now. My head’s pounding, sweat’s dripping down my neck. Every second feels heavier. I’m sitting in my patrol car, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turn white, trying to focus on the road, trying to remind myself of one thing: I need to get home.\n\nAnna and Joey are waiting for me. They have to be. I told them to lock themselves in, to stay safe until I got there. But I’m losing time—blacking out in moments, coming to without knowing how far I’ve gone. My arm’s starting to throb worse, and I keep pulling my sleeve down to cover the wound, as if hiding it could somehow stop it from spreading.\n\nI try the radio again. Static. Nothing but damn static. Every station’s gone silent. Dispatch was overrun before I even got to my car. Last I heard, the whole county was falling apart. People turning in the streets, ripping each other apart. The station was lost within hours. No one’s coming. It’s just me now.\n\nI’m gripping the steering wheel, staring down the empty road, but every so often, I see things in the corners of my eyes. Shadows that flicker, faces that aren’t there. I blink, and they’re gone. Or maybe they’re not.\n\nMy mind’s slipping. \n\nI pass the town square. It’s chaos—cars overturned, bodies sprawled everywhere. Some of them are moving, twitching, dragging themselves across the asphalt. I hit the gas, but my foot feels heavy, disconnected from the rest of me. I have to get home. I promised Anna. I promised Joey. \n\nMy phone buzzes. I fumble it out of my pocket, but it’s just a message from hours ago. Anna telling me she’s locking the doors, telling me to hurry. I try calling, but it doesn’t even ring. Damn service.\n\nMy vision blurs. I nearly run off the road, jerking the wheel just in time. There’s something crawling up my throat—a mix of bile and fear, maybe more. I cough hard, spitting out something black and thick onto the floorboard. I stare at it, my brain trying to connect the dots, but I can’t. I can’t think straight. It doesn’t make sense. Nothing does.\n\nThe bite on my arm itches, the flesh around it turning purple and sickly. I know what’s happening. I’ve seen it a hundred times today. I’ve shot the ones who didn’t get away in time. I know what’s coming for me, but I can’t stop. I can’t stop thinking about Anna, about Joey’s laugh, about that picture-perfect family life I’ll never get to live again if I give up now. \n\nI need to see them, one last time.\n\nThe streets blur together, and I can’t tell if I’m driving through town or down some nightmare. The houses all look the same—boarded up, abandoned. I slam on the brakes outside my house. I’m here. I don’t even remember driving the last few blocks. \n\nMy vision’s swimming, and my hands don’t feel like my own anymore. I drag myself out of the car, stumble toward the front door. I can hear voices inside—Joey’s laugh, Anna calling my name. It’s a lifeline, pulling me forward, even as my legs start to give out beneath me.\n\nI bang on the door. “Anna! It’s me!”\n\nNothing. Just silence.\n\nI bang harder, feeling my strength slipping, feeling the heat in my head rising. “Open up, please!” I scream, my voice hoarse. \n\nThe door cracks open, just a sliver, and I see her. Anna’s eyes are wide, filled with fear. She knows. She sees the blood dripping from my arm, the purple spreading up my neck. She sees what I am now.\n\n“Stay back,” she says, her voice trembling. “You’re… you’re sick.”\n\nI shake my head. “No… I can fight it. I just… I need to be here. I need to see Joey. Please, Anna, don’t shut me out.” My voice is breaking. I can barely keep it together.\n\nShe looks at me for what feels like an eternity. Then the door closes. Just like that. I hear the lock click. \n\nI collapse on the porch, my strength gone. I can hear Joey’s voice inside, laughing, playing. But I’m not part of that world anymore. I’m not the man I was. I’m something else, something worse.\n\nThe itching turns to burning. The voices in my head grow louder. And as I stare up at the blood-red sky, the world goes dark."},"349":{"title":"The Silent Sketch ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjxqes\/the_silent_sketch\/","flair":"Images &amp; Comics","author":"gacoldfish","selftext":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qh8yb78jllpd1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98365c59d89a94d0ce0f16505c95917873059380\n\nI started drawing her by accident. Just a sketch, nothing more. A woman... or maybe a creature. She didn’t have a face at first, just a vague figure. But every time I drew her again, she came back, more detailed, as if my hands were following some force older than my own will. Her features changed, new details appeared, but one thing always stayed the same: her strange smile.\n\nAfter each sketch, I burned or tore the drawing. I had to erase it, forget it. But this time, I couldn’t. Something inside me made me keep it. I placed it on my desk, feeling guilty, and that night, she appeared in my dreams.\n\nShe was standing there, in a room with smooth, grey walls, a frozen smile on her face. She moved her lips, trying to talk to me, but no sound came out. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. Her smile was soft, yet it scared me.

The moment I stepped into that decrepit building, I could feel something sinister lurking in the shadows. But being a skeptic, I shrugged it off as mere superstition.\n\nAs I began exploring the mansion, I stumbled upon a locked door hidden behind a tapestry in the hallway. Curiosity got the better of me, and I managed to pry it open with an old rusty key I found in the study.\n\nInside was a room untouched by time, frozen in the past. Dust-covered furniture, moth-eaten curtains, and faded portraits adorned the walls. But what caught my attention was a peculiar painting in the corner—a portrait of a woman with hauntingly familiar eyes.\n\nIgnoring the chill running down my spine, I approached the painting. It felt as if those eyes were staring right through me, piercing into the depths of my soul. I couldn't tear my gaze away.\n\nSuddenly, a voice whispered from behind me, \"Why have you come here?\"\n\nI spun around, but the room was empty. Fear gripped my heart as I realized I was alone. Or so I thought.\n\nFrom that day on, strange things began happening in the mansion. Doors slammed shut on their own, eerie whispers echoed through the halls, and shadows danced in the moonlight.\n\nI tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but deep down, I knew something sinister was at play. And it all seemed to center around that forgotten room and the enigmatic woman in the painting.\n\nDesperate for answers, I delved into the mansion's history, uncovering dark secrets buried beneath layers of time. It was then that I learned about Evelyn, my great-grandmother's sister, who was said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n\nLegend had it that Evelyn had dabbled in the occult, seeking forbidden knowledge beyond the realms of the living. Some whispered she had made a pact with dark forces, while others believed she had become a vessel for vengeful spirits.\n\nBut one thing was clear—Evelyn's presence lingered in the mansion, trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead. And now, it seemed she was reaching out to me, drawing me deeper into her web of darkness.\n\nAs the days passed, I became consumed by fear and paranoia, unable to escape the mansion's malevolent grasp. Every night, I would hear her whispers growing louder, her icy fingers brushing against my skin.\n\nI knew I had to leave, to escape the horrors that lurked within those walls. But Evelyn wouldn't let me go. She had claimed me as her own, a pawn in her twisted game of torment and despair.\n\nAnd so, I remain trapped in that forgotten room, forever haunted by the ghost of Evelyn and the sins of the past.

The console I grew up with was the Nintendo 64. The games on the console are great, but the one I liked the most was Super Mario 64. Unfortunately, I realized that I don’t have a copy of Super Mario 64 since, if I remember correctly, my parents sold a lot of games I had, and as we were moving at the time, we kept the original Super Smash Bros., in which I had a lot of fun playing.\n\nAnyway, we saved up, and we had enough money to afford more games, so I asked my parents if I could get Super Mario 64 again; they agreed, and I went across the street to the nearby GameStop next to Walmart because it's a submall with GameStop. Now, keep in mind that my first idea was to get the game from eBay; however, I don't really trust the sellers, so I went to GameStop to see if they were having a nostalgia sale or whatever. For some reason, I didn't expect this—I found the game along with other games like Majora's Mask, another favorite game of mine, without hesitation; I purchased it and Majora's Mask because of my nostalgia trip—but there was no short message written in sharpie on the cartridge or anything eerie from one of those haunted game stories I'd seen before.\n\nI returned home and turned on my Nintendo 64 to begin playing, and the game began as it usually does: I was greeted by the head of Mario, I pressed START, and it played the cutscene where Mario jumped out of the pipe. I didn't find anything weird; it was like any other Mario game. Keep in mind that this game was not cheap; it cost the exact same as what you would expect from a Super Mario 64 copy.\n\nAnyway, when I first started the Bob-omb Battlefield level, I collected stars one by one.\n\nAfter I reached the top of the mountain, King Bob-omb came there to greet Mario and say his line. For some reason, his brother is mentioned in the text, but I don't remember what it said because I was focused on the good part of the level, fighting King Bob-omb. I did notice the text, though; it said something about Luigi. If you saw the text in the original game, it was familiar, but this game included a different way to end the message.\n\nI didn't care since there's nothing weird about hearing Luigi mentioned in any of the Mario series. I finally collected the star after I defeated King Bob-omb.\n\nNothing really weird happens; it's just me having fun.\n\nBut I played the game until I unlocked the basement after defeating Bowser and getting the key. I didn’t go into any detail because nothing fascinating happened, and then I entered the basement.\n\nThis area always creeped me out as a kid since it was dark down there, and it gave me an eerie feeling like the regular game gave me; I don’t know why. I just walked around; I usually stopped periodically and mashed the buttons on my N64 controller to activate something; I don’t know what I activated, but I might’ve activated a secret; and eventually, I reached the part of the basement where the picture frame of Lethal Lava Land is after running through the halls.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3mocgn9rznpd1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=443c189445aa80e1dc0c4871ad1d635105beaee5\n\nFor some reason, instead of the figure in the picture frame, it was Luigi. For some odd reason, this version of Super Mario 64 is so dedicated to Luigi that it's almost like the \"Year of Luigi\" thing is still continuing; I personally didn't find anything wrong with it since I like Luigi as a character after all.\n\nAgain, it didn’t seem too out of the ordinary because Luigi was planned to be in the game during the beta test days, but I just jumped into the picture frame, and I was sent to the level afterward.\n\nLethal Lava Land was the same as it normally should be, but some platforms were missing, and coins were gone.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bmrq8j7tznpd1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0041b3c1a33fc399dbb6e95d00025c4841b9e506\n\nI began looking for stars to collect in order to unlock a level or star room. I eventually arrived at the platform where Mr. I was supposed to be, but instead of Mr. I, the eyeball enemy, Luigi was standing there on the edge, not moving at all. I approached him to see if he was just Mr. I with a different model; this could have been a modded version of Super Mario 64, a personalized copy, or something else, and I accidentally pushed him into the lava.\n\nI felt very bad for him.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vydy3fuwznpd1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089c89eae48d580feca76782b4ce3c513c094acd\n\nHis screams and cries for Mario were not distorted or recorded by a different person; they were made by Charles Martinet, the voice actor of Mario and Luigi, their usual voice actor. Maybe, judging by this being clearly recent, it sounded like the screams were A.I. generated.\n\nAfter Luigi’s flesh melted and he drowned in the lava, a star flew out of the lava, and I collected it.\n\nI was instantly sent to Peach’s castle, but for some reason, I was knocked out of the picture frame like Mario is when he fails a level. I noticed that the water was red, almost like blood, and Mario had a terrified expression on his face.\n\nRight behind him, Luigi looked different—almost like a zombie; his clothes were darker, and his skeleton was visible. His clothes were torn as well. Every time I tried to find my way out, it was like the endless staircase you need to go up to defeat Bowser. But every door was locked, and the gruesome imagery of Luigi will stay in my mind when I try to sleep.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nhawp8xyznpd1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b165f7399c7d2498d03dd7d2681871ced57745\n\nTrust me, I tried everything to get out of this situation. I tried doing the BLJ (Backwards long jump) to get out of this, and guess what? It didn't work.\n\nThe eerie part is that Luigi in the picture frame had 1080p graphics, and the game doesn’t really have higher graphics since the console is pretty old and it was beyond the system's technical limitations. While the main graphics worked, this was different. You've seen games like Super Smash Bros. and the others, and the quality didn't look like Luigi's picture frame. The picture of Luigi's disfigured body in the picture frame threw the original graphics out the window, and if I'm being honest, I really liked how this version worked. Unfortunately, I will probably not be able to try this version again, but luckily, I screenshotted everything in this game.\n\nAnyway, this bloodied water rose, and Mario drowned in it while performing the drowning animation; there are no more lives since it took them all, and it returned me to the intro with Mario's head; the game went back to normal; I turned off the game as I'm not taking any risks anymore; I'm done.\n\n—\n\nIf you want to play this version of Super Mario 64, lucky for you, I copied the original game file and brought it over to the web. Good luck finding it. As for the game itself, I still have it since, after this situation, the copy is back to normal; there's no creepy moment where Luigi gets burned by Mario pushing him, and I'm able to play it normally again. How did I put the original game on the web? I dumped the ROM, and for goodness' sake, do not ask for a link.\n\nFor now, I'm protecting this blog, and if my brother ever finds this game, this blog will be given to him, as just like me, he loves Mario, and he knows more about this stuff than I do. Hopefully, he will do a better job than I did with this blog, my grammar, or anything like that.\n\nNothing's going to happen, and I will be fine. I will just enjoy my copies of Majora's Mask and Super Mario 64.\n\nMy wish is for my brother to record this experience and do a better job than I did.\n\nI hope that I will stop having nightmares of Luigi getting his face burned off and his screams."},"353":{"title":"Best\/worst video game creepypastas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fkcbhr\/bestworst_video_game_creepypastas\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Logaheart","selftext":"What are some of the best\/worst gaming creepypastas?

They were dense, dark, and full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered. But there was one area that always seemed to call to me, a secluded part of the forest where the trees stood closer together, their branches intertwining to form a natural canopy that blocked out most of the sunlight.\n\nOne day, driven by curiosity, I decided to venture deeper into this shadowy enclave. As I pushed my way through the thick undergrowth, a sense of unease washed over me. It felt as though unseen eyes were watching my every move, and the air was thick with an oppressive silence broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of trudging through the underbrush, I stumbled upon a small clearing. In the center stood a dilapidated cabin, its wooden walls weathered and worn by time. Despite its decrepit appearance, something compelled me to approach it.\n\nAs I stepped inside, a chill ran down my spine. The interior was barren save for a single chair sitting in the center of the room. On instinct, I sat down, and that's when I heard it—the whispering.\n\nAt first, it was barely audible, like the faintest breeze rustling through the leaves. But as I listened closer, the whispers grew louder, filling the cabin with an eerie cacophony of voices. They spoke in hushed tones, their words unintelligible yet somehow familiar, as though they were calling out to me from a distant memory.\n\nSuddenly, the walls of the cabin began to warp and shift, morphing into grotesque shapes that seemed to pulsate with a life of their own. I tried to stand up, to flee from this nightmarish scene, but an unseen force held me in place, trapping me in the clutches of the whispering woods.\n\nAs the voices grew louder, I felt a presence looming behind me, its presence suffocating and oppressive. With a sense of dread, I turned to face it, only to be met with darkness so absolute that it seemed to consume everything in its path.\n\nIn that moment, I realized the true nature of the whispering woods—they were not merely a place of shadows and secrets, but a gateway to something far more sinister, something beyond the realm of human understanding.\n\nI tried to scream, to call out for help, but my voice was drowned out by the deafening chorus of whispers that surrounded me. And as the darkness closed in, I knew that I was doomed to wander the whispering woods for all eternity, trapped in a nightmare from which there was no escape."},"356":{"title":"A werewolf on the road","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk2k3r\/a_werewolf_on_the_road\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"It was a sweltering night in November of 1964. Guilherme, with his foot on the gas, drove his father’s borrowed car like he was in a race. In the back seat, Júlio and Roberto laughed loudly, and Isabela, sitting in the front seat, held a nearly empty bottle of beer. Everyone was excited, ready for the party in the neighboring town. The road was deserted, with very little lighting, and the sound of the car’s engine was practically the only thing echoing through the warm night air.\n\nDistracted by the conversation and the beer he had already drunk, Guilherme didn’t notice the large, furry shadow that crossed the road ahead of him. It happened too fast. The impact was hard, and the car jolted violently. The sound of metal crunching and tires screeching on the road made the group fall silent for a second.\n\n“Dude, what the hell was that?” Júlio shouted from the back seat, leaning forward.\n\n“I think we hit something, but I didn’t see what it was,” Guilherme replied, his heart racing, his hands trembling on the wheel.\n\n“Get the hell out and check!” Roberto shoved Guilherme lightly, while Isabela stared into the darkness outside.\n\nGuilherme swallowed hard. The car was stopped in the middle of nowhere, and all that could be heard was the muffled sound of the still-running engine. Gathering his courage, he opened the door and stepped out. The night wind brought with it a strong smell of grass and... something else. A strange, almost animal-like odor.\n\nThe headlights illuminated a small stretch of the road, but, surprisingly, there was no sign of anything. No body, no animal. Guilherme slowly walked to the front of the car and saw the dented fender. He crouched down and noticed something strange stuck to the grille. Hair. Thick, coarse, like that of a dog.\n\nSuddenly, a deep growl came from the darkness at the edge of the road.\n\nGuilherme froze. His muscles locked up for a second before he ran back to the car, nearly tripping over his own feet.\n\n“What was it? What was it?” Isabela asked, her voice filled with panic.\n\n“There was nothing there, but…” he tried to speak, but fear choked him. “I heard something. We need to leave, now!”\n\nHe started the car with his hands still shaking, but before he could shift into gear, the sound of something big approaching the car began to echo on the road. It was like claws scratching the asphalt, accompanied by a deep growl.\n\n“Start the damn thing and get out of here!” Roberto shouted, now staring out the back window, his eyes wide.\n\nGuilherme floored the gas, but the car began to shake. The engine sputtered as if it was having trouble, and suddenly, it died. Silence filled the car, interrupted only by their heavy breathing.\n\n“No, no, no!” Guilherme tried turning the key again, but the car wouldn’t respond. It was as if something had broken for good. Júlio tried to open the door, but Roberto grabbed him.\n\n“Are you crazy? Don’t go out there!”\n\n“What do we do?” Isabela asked, nearly in tears.\n\n“Shut up, dammit!” Guilherme yelled, and then everything got darker when the creature appeared.\n\nThe headlights captured the silhouette of the thing that was now slowly walking towards the car. It was huge, bipedal, with black fur and glowing eyes, almost red. Its long snout was dripping with saliva, and its claws scraped the ground with each step. It was a werewolf. Everyone froze in fear, except for Guilherme, who continued to desperately turn the key.\n\nSuddenly, red lights from a police car began flashing on the road in the distance. A patrol car was heading towards them. The sound of the siren cut through the air, and for a brief moment, everyone felt relieved.\n\nHowever, the creature stopped moving and turned its snout towards the patrol car. Guilherme watched, unable to believe what was happening, as the werewolf growled, baring teeth as sharp as knives, and then, with an astonishingly agile leap, it disappeared into the darkness of the woods.\n\nThe patrol car pulled up alongside them, and two officers got out, flashlights in hand.\n\n“What happened here?” one of the officers asked, his face serious.\n\nGuilherme was speechless. Júlio started speaking, stammering.\n\n“I-I think we hit… a wolf… or… something like that…”\n\nThe other officer shined his flashlight on the front of the car, inspecting the dented fender and the hair stuck in the grille. He narrowed his eyes but said nothing. The sound of the radio crackled from the patrol car, breaking the silence.\n\n“You guys are lucky we were patrolling here. You shouldn’t be drinking and driving,” the first officer said sternly, looking directly at Guilherme.\n\nGuilherme, still trembling, nodded without saying a word.\n\n“We’re towing the car. Get in the patrol car, the party’s over for you guys.”\n\nWithout arguing, the group obeyed. As they drove away in the patrol car, Isabela looked back at the dark and deserted road. She was sure she saw something between the trees, but when she blinked, the figure was gone.\n\nWhatever that thing was, it wasn’t over.\n\n"},"357":{"title":"It came from the trees (Part Four)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk2fw8\/it_came_from_the_trees_part_four\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"WaluigiStan","selftext":"\nI’ve been driving for days.

When I arrived back, they were all there waiting for me. I was a little early so I thought I would beat them there. \n\n“Hey, ready to eat?” Eric asked me. They all three stood up from the couch at the same time and started heading towards me. \n\n“Yeah, that class took forever.” I said holding the door open for them.\n\nWe went to a local diner that had only one other table with customers. We sat at a booth in the back of the diner. Eric sat first then on the other side Will and Emily sat. I sat at the only available spot, beside Eric. A few minutes later our waitress came over and took our orders. \n\n“So, we want to invite you to a gathering tomorrow night…” Eric said “…just us three and you if you’re interested.” Eric asked.\n\n“Oh, like a party?” I asked. My ears perked up hearing his offer. I’ve never been to a non-birthday party party before. \n\n“Sort of. I’m going to be blunt. Don’t freak out. You can say no at any time and we can still be friends. Do you believe in the supernatural?” Eric asked carefully.\n\n“Like…Sam and Dean, or real-life hauntings and stuff?” I joked. \n\nThey laughed and Eric replied, “No, not Sam and Dean. Real.”\n\n“I read fantasy stuff all the time so yeah, I do…I think my old orphanage was haunted but I don’t know…are you ghost hunters or something?” I asked.\n\n“We’re more like Ghost Talkers…” he replied “…we want to know what happened to certain people before they died. Especially ones that died without a cause listed. Here’s where a lot of people run away and we don’t blame them…We harness them into our bodies. We basically let them possess us for a brief period to communicate and then we close off our bodies and the portal we created. We then record the entire interaction. By doing this we can give people their lineage or find out how someone passed for evidence purposes.” Eric explained. He was stone faced. No small smirk or even a quiet chuckle from him or the others. I could tell they were completely serious. A chill went up my arms and into my head. I’m not sure if I was scared or…excited. I’ve read about being spiritual and possession before but I always thought the books I read were a little outlandish.\n\n  \n“Have you ever heard of a Ouija board before? That’s what the general public uses to communicate with the dead.” I said, sounding a bit standoffish but trying not to offend them. \n\n“It’s too slow…” Emily blurted out. “…there’s also a lot that can be taken out of context or just not said at all. For a spirit to use a Ouija board it has to harness its own power. With us however, we lend our physical means, our power, to them. It’s much less stressful for them. It nets a better result overall.” She explained. Confident in her words she sat back and sipped on her Iced Tea. \n\n“Yeah, what she said.” Eric said, leaning forward, elbows on the table with his hands covering his mouth. “So, what do you say? Wanna try it?” Eric asked after a long and uncomfortable pause.\n\nI sat there silent until the food came about three minutes later. I looked at my Grilled Cheese sandwich and I realized that I lost my appetite. Not from the food, of course…but because I was just offered a chance to essentially be a host body for a spiritual detective case. You don’t get offered that very often. But…I was intrigued. \n\n“I’m in…” I said. “I work until 7pm tomorrow but I’m free after that. Where do we meet?”\n\n“Oh, okay awesome. Meet at Hanger’s Woods, tomorrow at 9pm.” Eric said. He seemed shocked that I was so interested in his offer. To be honest, I was too. “You know where Hanger’s Woods is right?” Will asked. Before I could answer Emily chimed in, “Go past the square in town heading north. A mile up the road there’s a dirt road, it looks like it goes on for miles and it does. Three miles in fact. Do not drive. At the end of the dirt road there’s an iron gate. Go over it and we will be there. Got it?”\n\n“Okay, MapQuest.” I said hoping they would laugh. They did. It honestly felt amazing to have friends. Even if they’re “Ghost Talkers” as they said. After dinner I rushed home and got ready for bed. I threw on an episode of The Office and passed out a few minutes later. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I made sure to pack a bag for work and for later that night. Flashlight, phone battery pack, first aid kit, water and some trail mix. Class was the same old same old. Throughout the day walking in between classes I looked for my new friends but I couldn’t find them. Even in the commons area. They must have been busy getting ready for tonight. After all, it can’t be easy to summon the dead without prep work, right? After I got out of work I immediately headed for the woods. It was a good walk and I was a little tired after work so I didn’t want to hurry. I wanted to enjoy the walk. During my walk I did a little research about Hanger’s Woods on my phone. I discovered that the gate is like a sort of historical landmark\/monument. Apparently, the gate is in the same position as where the town I just passed through did their hanging back in the late 1700’s early 1800’s. After the town was overrun with “more classy people” as the website put it, they shut down hangings completely. After they shut it down, the Hangman that performed the executions started to have hallucinations of the people he had hung. They tormented him so bad that he eventually ended up hanging himself. I guess that’s why they call it Hanger’s Woods. So why were we coming here? It’s a fact that he did it himself. I finished reading the article as I got to the gate. I wanted to save it for later but my phone lost all service and internet connection as I leaned against the gate. I looked through the gate trying to find my new friends but I couldn’t see them. I look back down at my phone to check the time. 9:02 P.M. I was only two minutes late; did they really leave already? As if they heard my thoughts, I heard Eric call my name. I look through the gate again and see them at the edge of the woods. \n\n“Climb over the gate, don’t disrespect any of the property.” Eric told me.\n\nI scaled the gate easily enough and jumped to the ground. A cloud of dirt hit me in the face and I started to cough. I reach in my bag for a towel and my flashlight. I turn on the flashlight, ”Turn that off!” Emily screamed at me. “Heard!” I said back. I wiped the dirt off my face and started towards them. \n\n“Stuck the landing. Good work.” Eric said. “Let's head in. He’s waiting.” I stared at the woods puzzled and then back at them. \n\n“Everyone’s here though.” I said confused.\n\n“The hangman…” Will said with a cocky smirk.\n\n“Oh, I was reading about him on the way over here. The article said he hung himself after going mad…”\n\n“…because he was being tormented from the spirits of the people he hung?” Eric said, interrupting me. “Yeah, we all read that article. We feel there’s something more. The article states that after hangings were outlawed is when he started being tormented. It just seems too convenient that he wasn’t tormented for all the years he performed the hangings, but only afterwards? It doesn’t make sense. We’re thinking foul play and his fate was re-written by historians because they were trying to perfect the town's image so that richer people move there.”\n\nI stood there in a sort of shock at the amount of thought and research that went into this. I quickly snapped out of it. They said they were serious about this so it’s no wonder they did their due diligence. \n\n“Let’s do this.” Eric said, leading us into the woods. We went about a mile into the woods into a clearing. On the ground in the clearing, I see an emblem painted in orange paint and tiki torches lighted for us to see. The emblem was a circle with a cross in the middle and five lines protruding from the bottom of the circle facing downward. Each tiki torch at the bottom of each line. The air started to get heavy. \n\n“Here...” Will said, handing me the same orange paint. “…paint that same emblem on your right palm. When you’re ready let us know and we will guide you through it. Don’t speak until we say so. When we say “now” place your painted palm on the ground at the emblem.” \n\nI’ve gotten myself into some serious stuff now. This is real and not like one of my books. I expected some weird stuff, obviously after the talk we had at the diner, but this. This was a lot. But, against my better judgment and want for friends, I accepted the paint and started the design. After about five minutes I was done and flashed them a quick thumbs up, signaling I was ready. They waved me over, each one now standing at an end of the cross. They pointed me to the open space at the top of the cross. I walk over and stand facing them. Each one flashes me a head nod and they start chanting in unison. \n\n“Wronged Hangman…lend us your words…give us the knowledge only you can give us…” the ground starts to sink beneath me. I wanted to scream out for help but I kept quiet. “…we offer this body as a vessel for your truth…consume it so we can speak…NOW!” I did as I was told and placed my painted hand on the ground. The ground stopped sinking around me as a gust of wind blew from behind me. It knocked the other three off of their feet. Everything stopped. It was quiet just like before the ritual started. \n\nEric was the first to get up. “I had a feeling that was gonna happen…” he said, dusting himself off. “…you’re too strong.” \n\n“Too strong?” I replied. “Too strong for what? For him to take me over?” \n\n“Yes…” Will said, reaching his feet again.\n\n“We need you weaker, mentally.” Emily said doing the same as the others.\n\n“What does that even mean? I can’t help that.” I said.\n\n“Look, being strong willed isn’t a bad thing, until now. We need to dig up some stuff from you. Nothing too major. You got any trauma?” Eric asked. That was the most straightforward question I have ever been asked.\n\nI stood there and all I could think about was my childhood. How alone I felt most of the time. That was until Jennie came into my life. But every time I thought of her, I had to push her out of my mind. I then thought about the last words I ever said to my Mother. \n\n“Bye mommy, see you later! I love you!”\n\nI thought of how she didn’t even look back. I started to feel a heaviness in my stomach and a lump in my throat. I put my head down and started to cry. Why didn’t she want me? Why couldn’t she just hold on to me when I needed her most? Even more tears came down. My breathing started to become a little more labored. The sense of overwhelming sorrow took a hold of me but I couldn’t let my friends down. I figured I can use this sorrow for something productive. I looked up, tears streaming down my face and I locked eyes with Eric. I nodded. \n\n\"Wronged Hangman…lend us your words…give us the knowledge only you can give us…” again the ground became weak beneath my feet, I held on, “…we offer this body as a vessel for your truth…consume it so we can speak…NOW!” With more force than last time I slammed my palm into the ground. This time my arm started to shake uncontrollably and I started to sweat. As I felt the numbness creeping up to my shoulder, I thought of Jennie. I thought of the light she brought into my life during my hardest times. Suddenly, the ground was firm again. However, my arm was still numb.\n\nMy mind was racing, like I had someone else talking to me somehow telepathically. My ears were ringing like a cannon just went off inside my ear drum deafening me for a short period. Tears were still streaming down my face as I looked up to see the three of them gathered closely talking to one another. I couldn’t hear a word of what they were saying but they kept looking at me strangely. I hope I didn’t scare off my new friends with my past coming out. When they saw me starting to try and stand up they rushed over to me. \n\n“Hey, Ryan! You good?” Eric yelled while hurrying toward me.\n\n“Yeah, I’m good.” I replied weakly. “Good news…it worked.” Will said with a smile. \n\n“Yeah, I kinda figured. My arm is killing me. It feels like pins and needles are repeatedly sticking into me.” I said.\n\n“Good, that’s how it's supposed to feel. Now let's head back to my dorm, we have a safety room set up and camera so we can document what the Hangman has to say.” Emily said.\n\nWe gathered all of the equipment used for the ritual and washed the paint off of the ground. After about ten minutes the site was just the way they found it. Empty. We walked back to the dorms in silence. No one said a word. It wasn’t like they were ignoring me but it just felt that way. I know everyone was focused on the task we had waiting for us and the no doubt long night ahead. We got back to campus around 11pm. That's when Emily finally spoke. \n\n“Did you bring a leather-bound book?” She said.\n\nWhat was she talking about? She didn’t ask me to bring anything.\n\n“Oh yeah, did you?” Will asked. “We need that to…” he paused for a moment looking like he got distracted. The smell of a Mcdonald's right beside the campus must’ve caught his nose.“...for you to write in. In case the Hangman doesn’t want to talk.” Eric finished.\n\n“I have a journal that I got from Wal-Mart before I started school. It’s at my dorm. I haven’t really checked if it was real leather though.” I replied, still confused as to when they asked me to bring this. “Let’s go get it.” Emily said frantically.\n\n“We’re burning time here.” I lead them to my dorm hall. I grabbed my keys and out of my pocket and I unlock the door and suddenly….light’s out. I woke up in my dorm with my roommate on the phone with his Mom asking what he should do with me.

I’ll continue to post until I find a way to completely wipe that anomaly from the game.\n\nAs it turns out, I lied about posting tomorrow in my previous update. Sorry, everyone. The reason I haven’t been posting lately is that I’ve been feeling sick.\n\nWhy? Well, I’ve been having fainting spells and throwing up at school. I had to stay home a few times and felt lightheaded. I’m feeling better now, though. I still don’t understand why all of that happened right after I posted *BURNT.wmv* on YouTube. If it was because of that specific video or something, then that’s just ridiculous.\n\nThankfully, I’m back, even though it hasn’t been that long. However, I’ve been speaking with my therapist lately about the strange Mario figure I saw before the game shut off, before I even answered. If I remember correctly, looking back on these posts...\n\nHe was asking for my help, saying he was being held captive, and he wanted me to save him, along with the real Luigi I’m planning to rescue. I will do this, but I’ll need to get the video footage ready.\n\nBefore you ask, yes, I used a cheat code to unlock a 100% save file, as paranormal investigators don’t sit around playing games for fun; they take their investigation seriously.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/fX6i2VHbddQ?si=6iWajpqm2X1RViVq](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fX6i2VHbddQ?si=6iWajpqm2X1RViVq)\n\nRegardless, I opened Project 64, loaded my *Super Mario 64* copy, and started playing (I’m sure you’ve heard this before). I opened my previous save file from last time (which was, oddly, empty this time), and I ended up in a different part of the courtyard at Peach’s Castle. It was the same location with the Power Star monument that had a message beneath it, which I still don’t understand (like, what is it? ‘Eternal Star’ or ‘L is Real 2401’?). Despite not understanding the message, I noticed that all of the Boos were missing, including the Boo with the cage (which would normally break the game, but I didn’t care since I didn’t need to go there).\n\nI also noticed that all of the trees were gone, except for one. However, that tree had Burnt Luigi’s model on it. The missing trees still had shadows beneath them, but one shadow was clearly misplaced—it was standing behind the fountain.\n\nI could have easily climbed it, but I didn’t want to test that theory, considering the consequences of what might happen if I did.\n\nWhen I looked up, I saw that the sky had turned from red to pitch black. I ignored it and slowly approached the fountain, when the Endless Staircase theme started playing very, very slowly. Then an image of Luigi began flashing rapidly—it was the same black-and-white image you and I saw earlier in this post. It was Luigi (or Burnt Luigi), standing in the dark with his mouth wide open, almost as if he were smiling at the camera.\n\nThe music grew louder as the image continued flashing. The portrait of Lethal Lava Land also began flashing, until it all finally stopped, and the following text appeared:\n\n“Luigi has been unlocked.”\n\nThe text was in the same font as the messages on the signs, just like the “drown” message in my previous post that caused Mario to drown.\n\nI had completed one of my goals—rescuing Luigi from Burnt Luigi—and was rewarded by being able to play as him. After the text, my character switched from Mario to Luigi, and I was no longer in the courtyard.\n\nAs I made my way out of the castle, I noticed that the Toad who’s usually next to the entrance was completely gone. It was as if he had left in a big hurry. He was there before I unlocked Luigi, but now—like I said—he was gone. I went outside, but this time, all the trees were gone except for one. Again, it had the Burnt Luigi texture (descriptive, I know), but there was something pointy sticking out of the top of his head (which I couldn’t explain—might be a texture error). Luigi looked even more compressed.\n\nHe was just standing there in front of the castle, staring directly at me. Clearly, he was angry that I had freed Luigi, the one who had been imprisoned and framed. Trapped beneath the fountain, he had caused all those \"L is Real 2401\" rumors to spread like wildfire. I slowly approached him, and then the screen started flashing black (as if one of my PC adapters was acting up—my monitor sometimes goes black at random). A loud buzzing sound followed, and then the game crashed.\n\nI guess I’ll have to end this post here and troubleshoot what happened, because this is getting really weird..."},"360":{"title":"Burnt Luigi (Post #4)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk8tp5\/burnt_luigi_post_4\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"JosephTheSnail","selftext":"Hello, this is the fourth post? Well, we’re back at it again and ready to record some video footage! Especially since I built up the courage after those horrible nightmares and trying to save Luigi from that fountain. Now again, I know I was having nightmares, and they couldn’t possibly be real.\n\nTo lighten the mood with a bit of humor—how can this be real? This is just a game. Though, in all seriousness, I am interested to see if I can help the poor guy. I’ve developed a theory, and I’m assuming that since Luigi was in that fountain, it must mean that the monster isn’t actually him but is trying to ruin his reputation. However, this is just a theory, but there’s certainly a possibility.\n\nAnyway, I loaded up the game again, being greeted by Mario’s head. You get the idea, and I do too. So, I pressed start, which brought me to the file select screen. Thankfully, it was all normal this time. If you’ve read the second post, you may remember the files showcasing some graphic screens, such as Mario’s drowned corpse in the basement, Luigi’s hand reaching out of the lava, and Bowser’s decapitated body.\n\nNot to mention the faces of Mario, Luigi, and Bowser appearing on the files—they weren’t there anymore, which was a blessing. So, I hit the first save, the one with the single star. I should note that I have attached the video in the post, so you can follow along if you want to and point out certain things I might’ve missed.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/1Uh0oKNt\\_Qk?si=BcAxW3tGX2ttqQIu](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1Uh0oKNt_Qk?si=BcAxW3tGX2ttqQIu)\n\nBack on topic: as soon as I entered the game, I started to notice that something wasn’t quite right. Specifically, I noticed that two of the trees at the spawn were missing, but all that remained were the shadows where the trees used to be.\n\nThat wasn’t the only weird part, though. Sure, the audio with the birds and all of that was perfectly fine. However, as I looked at the sky and castle, I noticed something strange. It was even stranger than the lack of trees. When I looked up, I noticed the sky was dark red. Sure, it may look black depending on how you’re viewing the recording.\n\nBut the strangest part was Peach’s castle itself. Sure, everything remained intact, except I noticed that the top part of the castle was completely gone, with the windows floating in mid-air. Instead of a picture of Peach in the window, it was replaced with a grayscale photo of Luigi—of course, it had to be the one with the monster.\n\nIt looked as if the picture didn’t fit properly, with the frames sticking out. Now, I know for a fact that the picture was intended to be in the game, as it looked like it was in the same style. While unnerved, I was also interested and wanted to explore more. I didn’t want to enter the castle; I wanted to see the rest of the map.\n\nSo, I moved towards the water. Surprisingly, it wasn’t blood or anything like that, which somewhat brought me a sense of safety. Just regular blue water like it is in real life—nothing strange. Though, again, if the water had been blood, that’s when I’d start questioning things. But in this case, I saw nothing unusual. I explored some more, checked the water underneath the bridge—again, nothing strange. But I know some of you are hoping that there’s going to be something strange.\n\nI checked the signs, expecting some creepy message, my home address, or something like that. Nothing—absolutely nothing. Not even a new paragraph, which made me feel a little safer as I looked at the butterflies. Seeing them around, along with the fish in the water, made me feel less unnerved.\n\nAs I looked behind me, I saw the top part of the castle in the distance, which looked surprisingly cool if you ignored the castle behind me.\n\nI continued exploring some more and went to the side of the castle, which scared away the birds as I jumped around like crazy. But, as usual, everything was the same.\n\nAs I started getting bored, it wasn’t long until a message appeared above saying the following word in the sign’s text:\n\n“Drown.”\n\nWas this how I was supposed to unlock Luigi or something? I mean, I noticed the irony as I saw the image featuring Mario drowning, which was dark, sure. But since I was doing it to save someone, I found it both odd and interesting.\n\nNow, I have never seen the game make a message appear like that, which was fascinating.\n\nBut since I had no choice, I had to obey what the game told me to do, which was to jump into the water underneath the bridge and just sit there in the water until Mario ran out of air. As guilty and villain-minded as I felt, I didn’t think I had a choice. Heck, maybe this could possibly spawn me to the L is Real 2401 statue or something. I have many theories, but they’re probably not true.\n\nAs I sat there, Mario finally performed the drowning animation, gasping for air until he died. Instead of Bowser’s laugh and all of that, it took me to an odd screen, which removed my HUD as if I were getting a game over or something.\n\nI was looking at a black screen with nothing but an entity that resembled Mario’s model, except he was missing the eyes and the logo showing the “M” initial on his hat with the buttons on overalls missing. I heard no music until he started talking. Judging by the way he was speaking, I assumed he was either addressing me or somebody else.\n\nWhat I heard was the Merry-Go-Round music, which normally plays in the Haunted House level. I heard this as he turned his head towards me.\n\n“Player.”\n\n“You have to help me.”\n\n“Please listen.”\n\n“That monster, which looked like Luigi, isn’t actually him.”\n\n“You need to destroy him; he is holding me captive.”\n\n“Can you…?”\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“...”\n\nSince I didn’t say anything, he shut off my game. But I chose to say yes, typing it into my keyboard. Not sure if he wanted me to speak into my microphone or not, but just in case, I communicated through the keyboard.\n\nRegardless, I’ll see where this takes me tomorrow. That’s all I have to say for now. I’ll update my post tomorrow if I come across anything interesting.\n\nCheers."},"361":{"title":"Burnt Luigi (Post #3)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk8rmw\/burnt_luigi_post_3\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"JosephTheSnail","selftext":"Hello, it's Joseph again. I apologize for not posting about this in so long, and unfortunately, I couldn’t get video footage last night. My computer keeps acting up, and it’s driving me insane. This might be because Avast, my anti-virus software, kept tagging Project 64 and my Super Mario 64 file as viruses. I uninstalled it, so I should be able to record it later.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6oxhpirw0opd1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e78f9533c5366aca43d31f9fddf76b68dad7164\n\nI should also point out something. When I was writing this post, I noticed that my wallpaper had changed to that disturbing grayscale photo of Luigi, the same exact one that showed up during my gameplay. This startled me because it was the normal desktop picture earlier. Thankfully, I was able to change that freaky Luigi photo back to the original one.\n\nI’ve attached a screenshot of my wallpaper from that time for those who are curious.\n\nAs of last night, I haven’t really checked the Mario Amino much, and thankfully, when I did check, there were no messages from that Luigi guy. However, when I checked Discord, like I usually do, I was instantly hit with a message.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Hello, JosephTheSnail.\n\nOh, for the love of God. Yes, this thing has the “APP” (formerly known as “BOT”) icon, which shows that Burnt Luigi is a bot. Yeah, I know, Captain Obvious speaking here.\n\nBurnt Luigi: How are you today?\n\nMe: ...Good...?\n\nMe: You?\n\nBurnt Luigi: I am fine. Remember me?\n\nThis guy must think I'm stupid or something. Of course, I remember him. I had to deal with him in these past posts, and I sent him a very toxic response (which is usually what I do when someone makes me super annoyed and angry).\n\nMe: OF COURSE, I REMEMBER YOU! I HAD TO DEAL WITH YOU AND YOUR STUPID “OoOoOoOoOoO SpOoKy” SHENANIGANS. CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY?!\n\nThat was too much, I know, as he basically just asked if I remembered him. However, if you were reading my original posts about this freak, you would understand why I hate this guy by now.\n\nBurnt Luigi: I AM NINTEN–\n\nMe: Don’t. Start. It.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Why shouldn’t I? You banned me from the Mario Amino.\n\nMe: No, I didn’t lol.\n\nMe: I am not even a leader or curator there.\n\nI am sorry for not bringing this up in my second post. Judging by the fact that a former curator, TakeAsoda, deleted the chat and I blocked Luigi, I didn’t have the chance to see if he was banned from the community or not. But when I asked a higher-up in the Amino, they informed me that yes, they did ban Luigi from the Amino, so there you go.\n\nAfter I said that I am not a leader or curator, he started saying random gibberish, and of course, I started responding with annoying sentences used by other users.\n\nBurnt Luigi: The earth is flat.\n\nMe: Who asked?\n\nBurnt Luigi: Donald Trump is actually the 45th president.\n\nMe: Okay, but who aksed?\n\nMe: asked\\*\n\nBurnt Luigi: I am Nintendo.\n\nBurnt Luigi: Your death in real life will be by being burned alive.\n\nMe: ...\n\nThis guy was definitely trying to scare me by giving me those old-fashioned death threats and, of course, using that ridiculous “I AM NINTENDO” catchphrase of his.\n\nBurnt Luigi: I HATE YOU!\n\nMe: Very original.\n\nMe: To be honest.\n\nMe: I am becoming less and less scared of you by the moment.\n\nClearly, I lied when I said I was becoming less and less scared of him, as he later sent me my home address. Obviously, I am going to censor it for my safety.\n\nBurnt Luigi: You live at \\[\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\].\n\nMe: .\\_.\n\nLike anyone with sense would, I reported the user for exposing private identifying information. Luckily, Discord took action and dealt with the user.\n\n—\n\nHello again. I know I said hello twice, but after that one Discord incident, I've been having recurring nightmares, and I remember them all very clearly. Some of them were unrelated, but half had something to do with that copy of Super Mario 64.\n\nSomething inside me really wants me to sit down, shut up, record, and play the game. Please trust me; I don’t know what’s in that game, and I don’t know what it wants from me.\n\nI will share my nightmares with you.\n\nPlease forgive how short the paragraphs are; there isn’t much to explain here.\n\nI had one nightmare where I was doing my nightly walks, and there was a moment in the dream where I felt like I was being followed.\n\nI kept walking until I felt it.\n\nIt was a gloved hand, and the fingers touching my shoulder felt bony. I couldn’t even feel the nails, so I immediately stopped and turned around. I was going to tell this freak to stop following me and get a life.\n\n“HEY YOU—”\n\nI stopped when I looked at him; he looked like Luigi, or at least a man who looked very similar to him.\n\nThe man said, “You've got to help me.” I seemed confused and looked behind him, noticing a house on fire. I immediately took action and called the ambulance. They arrived quickly, but all of the people in the vehicle looked like Luigi; everybody looked like Luigi. I rubbed my eyes, and they turned out to be normal people.\n\n“Is everything alright?” they asked me, and I said, “Yeah.”\n\nAs I was going to explain the burning house and the identical Luigi fellow, I noticed a dragon-like creature in the far distance; it was revealed to be Bowser. You knew what to expect by now: screams were heard, and the town was burning to a crisp.\n\nI woke up in a sweat, hoping to get a nicer dream. I slept again, and once again, another dream.\n\nI woke up in a claustrophobic tunnel; the walls had the same texture as the ones seen in the basement of Peach’s Castle. It was extremely dark down there, so dark that I felt very paranoid as I imagined some unsettling face appearing out of the darkness and staring at me.\n\nWith each step I made, I heard the footstep audio from Super Mario 64 (duh, what did I expect) coming from behind me.\n\nI got even more paranoid with each step until I couldn’t control it anymore.\n\nI made the big mistake of turning my head to see Luigi’s burnt and charred body; he wasn’t in his N64 model, but instead, he looked more like he was made in CGI. I saw every unsettling detail of his corpse: his rolled eyeballs, the burnt eyelids, horrific teeth, and holes in his clothes, such as in the torso and gloves, revealing bone.\n\nIt made me uneasy.\n\nObviously, I kept walking, staring behind me, which stopped him from following me. I was afraid of turning my back.\n\nOnce again, I risked my life. Even though this was a dream, I started running and running until the tunnel became wider. The footsteps behind me got louder and louder. I looked behind me and saw Luigi trying to catch up to me until I looked around me again.\n\nWhat I saw was a hallway full of Luigis standing, making me afraid to touch the wall, even though that seemed gross. It got even grosser as I started smelling the stinky breath of the plumbers, which is typically what you expect from rotting corpses.\n\nThey all started chanting.\n\n“CONTINUE PLAYING THE GAME!”\n\n“CONTINUE PLAYING THE GAME!”\n\n“CONTINUE PLAYING THE GAME!”\n\nI started to cover my ears, still running and yelling “Stop...” over and over again, until they all went away, along with the one chasing me.\n\nMy fear soon went away until I entered the courtyard, where I saw the Power Star fountain in the middle.\n\nFeeling calmer than before, I looked into the fountain, and what was originally fear turned into sadness. I saw Luigi, the real one, stuck at the bottom of the fountain; he was being held by tentacles or vines.\n\nHis face was incredibly pale, and I noticed blood coming out of his jaw. Clearly, he was trying to live on those air bubbles that allow you to breathe longer underwater (if you’ve never played Super Mario 64 in your entire life).\n\nI noticed that he was reaching out his hand to me, which made me assume he was trying to get help from me. I rolled up my sleeve and grabbed his hand.\n\nI was mumbling, “Come on, you can do it, buddy.” Luigi immediately tried to grab my hand with as much strength as he could. I started to hold my grip to prevent myself from letting him go, with my anger boiling, knowing for a fact that his burned counterpart was responsible for this.\n\nThere is no way this was an accident, and there is no way Luigi would just casually fall into the fountain and be held by vines. Plus, he would use his strength to get out.\n\nThis was not the case.\n\nThankfully, we were both making progress. As I saw his face peeking out of the water, he was gasping for air. I successfully pulled him out of the water as Luigi’s color started returning.\n\n“Luigi, please, are you okay?!”\n\nLuigi then replied while coughing up some bloodied water, “Joseph, please finish this game. Save the Mushroom Kingdom for me and my friends.”\n\nLuigi spoke once more: “Wake up; there is still time. Stop him from ruining my reputation further.”\n\nI woke up, and I will finish this game in my next post. I will do it for my safety and his safety and figure out how to end that monster once and for all."},"362":{"title":"I led a secret mission during the Cold War, Today I expose what happened.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjxd9h\/i_led_a_secret_mission_during_the_cold_war_today\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"SocietysMenaceCC","selftext":"\nMy name is Captain James “Jim” Carter, and this is the account of Operation Black Frost. This story is not one for the faint-hearted, nor for those who seek comfort in the familiar. It’s a tale of darkness, treachery, and the cold, unforgiving grip of fear that comes from confronting the unknown.\n\nIn the winter of 1962, deep into the Cold War, I was part of a covert task force sent by the United States to infiltrate the frozen wilderness of Siberia. Our mission was to track down and eliminate a high-ranking Soviet official, Dimitri Ivanov, who was believed to be overseeing a top-secret government experiment. The nature of the experiment was unknown, but the little intelligence we had suggested it was a threat unlike anything we had encountered before.\n\nOur team consisted of nine soldiers, each handpicked for their unique skills and unwavering resolve. There was Lieutenant John “Johnny” Rourke, my second-in-command, a man of few words but immense bravery. Sergeant William “Bill” Turner, a grizzled veteran with an encyclopedic knowledge of explosives. Corporal David “Dave” Hernandez, our communications expert, whose quick wit often lightened the mood. Private First Class Samuel “Sammy” Lee, a sharpshooter with nerves of steel. Private Gregory “Greg” Thompson, our medic, whose calm demeanor under pressure was a beacon of hope. Private Richard “Rick” Davis, a scout with an uncanny ability to navigate the harshest terrains. Private Andrew “Andy” Johnson, our engineer, capable of making or breaking anything mechanical. Finally, Private Robert “Bobby” Kim, a linguist and cryptographer, essential for deciphering Russian communications.\n\nWe were dropped into the heart of Siberia under the cover of night, our breath visible in the frigid air as we trudged through knee-deep snow. The cold was merciless, cutting through our gear and chilling us to the bone. We moved swiftly and silently, each step taking us closer to our target and deeper into the unknown.\n\nOur journey began uneventfully, but as the days passed, an oppressive sense of dread settled over us. The forest around us seemed alive, the trees whispering secrets and shadows moving just out of sight. We had been trained to handle fear, but this was different. It was as if the very land was warning us to turn back.\n\nOn the third night, we set up camp near an abandoned village, its dilapidated buildings standing as silent witnesses to some long-forgotten tragedy. As we huddled around a small fire, the wind howling outside, Dave picked up a faint transmission on his radio. It was in Russian, and Bobby quickly translated. It was a distress signal, originating from within the village. Against our better judgment, we decided to investigate.\n\nThe village was eerily quiet, our footsteps echoing off the crumbling walls. We followed the signal to a small church at the edge of the village. The door creaked open, revealing a scene of horror. Bodies, frozen and contorted in agony, lay strewn across the floor. Their eyes were wide with terror, mouths frozen mid-scream. At the altar, a lone figure sat slumped over, clutching a radio. It was a Soviet soldier, his face twisted in fear, fingers frozen to the bone.\n\n“What the hell happened here?” Rick muttered, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n“I don’t know, but we need to get out of here,” Johnny replied, his eyes scanning the shadows.\n\nAs we turned to leave, the radio crackled to life. Static filled the room, followed by a voice, distorted and barely audible. “They are coming… the shadows…”\n\nBefore we could react, the church doors slammed shut, and the temperature plummeted. The shadows around us seemed to come alive, writhing and twisting as if possessed by some malevolent force. Panic set in, and we fired blindly into the darkness. The shadows dissipated, but not before claiming Sammy. He vanished into the darkness, his screams echoing long after he was gone.\n\nWe fled the village, our morale shattered and our numbers reduced. The forest seemed more hostile than ever, the shadows watching our every move. We pressed on, driven by duty and the need for answers.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and our supplies dwindled. The cold was relentless, sapping our strength and will to continue. Then, we found it—a hidden facility, buried deep within the mountains. It was heavily guarded, but we were determined to complete our mission.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, we infiltrated the facility. What we found inside was beyond comprehension. It was a laboratory, filled with strange devices and jars containing grotesque specimens. The air was thick with the stench of decay and chemicals. At the center of it all was Dimitri Ivanov, overseeing an experiment that defied all logic.\n\nHe was using the shadows themselves, harnessing their malevolent energy to create weapons of unimaginable power. The shadows were alive, feeding on fear and pain, growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nWe attempted to sabotage the facility, but the shadows fought back. One by one, my men were taken. Bill was torn apart by unseen forces, his screams filling the air. Greg was dragged into the darkness, his fate unknown. Rick and Andy were consumed by the shadows, their bodies disappearing without a trace. Dave and Bobby fought valiantly, but they too fell to the relentless onslaught.\n\nIn the end, it was just Johnny and me. We confronted Ivanov, but he was beyond reason, consumed by the power he had unleashed. In a final act of desperation, Johnny detonated the explosives we had planted, destroying the facility and the horrors within.\n\nI barely escaped, my body battered and broken. I wandered through the snow for days, the shadows still haunting my every step. Eventually, I was found by a Soviet patrol and taken prisoner. They never believed my story, and I spent years in a Siberian gulag, haunted by the memories of that fateful mission.\n\nThe gulag was a place of misery and despair, but it was nothing compared to the horrors I had faced in that cursed forest. The other prisoners were hardened criminals, spies, and political dissidents, but even they sensed that something was different about me. They kept their distance, whispering about the haunted American who spoke of shadows and unseen terrors.\n\nYears passed in a blur of hard labor, starvation, and the bitter cold. The guards took pleasure in our suffering, and any sign of weakness was met with brutal punishment. I learned to keep my head down, to endure the pain and the fear. But no matter how much I tried to bury the memories, the shadows were always there, lurking at the edges of my vision, whispering in the dead of night.\n\nOne particularly harsh winter, when the cold was so intense it felt like knives slicing through our flesh, I befriended a fellow prisoner named Sergei. He was a former KGB operative, a man of few words but with eyes that spoke volumes. He had seen things, things that made my stories of shadows seem almost mundane. We formed an unspoken bond, finding solace in each other’s company amidst the relentless bleakness of the gulag.\n\nOne night, as we huddled together for warmth in our barracks, Sergei leaned in and whispered to me. “I believe you, Jim. About the shadows. I’ve seen them too.”\n\nI stared at him, searching his eyes for any hint of deceit, but found only sincerity. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Before I was imprisoned here, I was part of an operation similar to yours,” Sergei explained. “We were sent to investigate a remote research facility in the Ural Mountains. What we found there… it was beyond comprehension. The scientists were experimenting with something they called ‘Project Nochnoy Zver’—the Night Beast. They were trying to harness the energy of the shadows, to create weapons that could strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.”\n\nMy blood ran cold as he spoke. “What happened to your team?”\n\n“They were all taken,” Sergei said, his voice barely above a whisper. “The shadows consumed them, one by one. I barely escaped with my life, just like you. But I was captured and thrown into this hellhole, and no one believed my story.”\n\nAs Sergei spoke, a plan began to form in my mind. If there was another facility, another project like Ivanov’s, then we had to find it. We had to stop it, once and for all. The shadows could not be allowed to spread their darkness any further.\n\n“Sergei, we have to get out of here,” I said, my voice filled with determination. “We have to find that facility and destroy it.”\n\nSergei nodded, his eyes gleaming with a newfound resolve. “But how? This place is a fortress. Escape is nearly impossible.”\n\n“We’ll find a way,” I replied. “We have to.”\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur of planning and preparation. We gathered what little resources we could, bartering with other prisoners for tools and information. It was dangerous work, and more than once we came close to being discovered by the guards. But desperation drove us forward, the knowledge that we were the only ones who could stop the shadows from spreading their terror.\n\nFinally, the night of our escape arrived. A brutal snowstorm raged outside, providing the perfect cover for our plan. Under the guise of a routine work detail, we managed to slip away from the main camp, making our way towards the outer perimeter. The cold was intense, sapping our strength with every step, but we pressed on, driven by the knowledge that failure was not an option.\n\nWe reached the outer fence, a towering barrier of barbed wire and electrified steel. Using the tools we had painstakingly gathered, we managed to cut our way through, slipping into the frozen wilderness beyond. The storm battered us mercilessly, but it also covered our tracks, buying us precious time.\n\nFor days, we traveled through the snow, surviving on whatever scraps of food we could find. The shadows were ever-present, watching, waiting. But Sergei and I were determined, refusing to give in to the fear that gnawed at our minds.\n\nFinally, we reached the Ural Mountains, their jagged peaks rising like silent sentinels against the sky. Sergei led the way, his knowledge of the terrain guiding us to the hidden facility. As we approached, a sense of dread settled over me, the memories of that fateful mission flooding back in vivid detail.\n\nThe facility was much like the one we had encountered in Siberia—an ominous structure of concrete and steel, hidden deep within the mountains. We watched from a distance, observing the guards and the routine of the compound. It was heavily fortified, but we were prepared to face whatever dangers lay within.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, we made our move, slipping past the outer defenses and into the heart of the facility. Inside, the air was thick with the stench of chemicals and decay. We crept through the dimly lit corridors, our hearts pounding in our chests. The shadows seemed to grow darker, more malevolent, as we neared the central chamber.\n\nAnd there, at the center of it all, we found him—Dimitri Ivanov, the architect of this madness. He stood before a massive machine, its mechanisms pulsating with a sickly, otherworldly light. The air crackled with energy, the shadows swirling around him like a living shroud.\n\n“You should not have come here,” Ivanov said, his voice cold and devoid of emotion. “You cannot stop what has already been set in motion.”\n\n“We’ll see about that,” I replied, my voice steady despite the fear gnawing at my insides.\n\nAs we moved to sabotage the machine, the shadows attacked, lashing out with tendrils of darkness that sought to envelop us. Sergei and I fought desperately, our bullets seemingly ineffective against the intangible foe. The shadows fed off our fear, growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nIn the chaos, Sergei was dragged into the darkness, his screams echoing through the chamber. I fought on, determined to finish what we had started. With a final, desperate act, I managed to overload the machine, causing it to explode in a blinding flash of light.\n\nThe shadows recoiled, their hold on reality weakening. But as the facility began to collapse around me, I realized the true horror of our situation. The shadows were not defeated; they were merely contained. And with Ivanov’s death, their malevolence was unleashed upon the world.\n\nI barely escaped the facility, stumbling through the snow as the mountain trembled and collapsed behind me. I wandered for days, the shadows still haunting my every step. Eventually, I was found by a rescue team, my body battered and broken, my mind shattered by the horrors I had witnessed.\n\nI was brought back to the United States, where I was debriefed and then quietly discharged. They tried to bury the truth, to silence me with threats and promises. But I know the shadows are still out there, lurking in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nAnd now, as I sit here in the quiet solitude of my home, I can feel them watching me. The shadows are always watching, always waiting. And once they have marked you, there is no escape."},"363":{"title":"Starfall Wood","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjzrwu\/starfall_wood\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"SpookyDabDaddy","selftext":"For most, the question of \"*when did your innocence die?* \" can seem like a loaded proposition. When it's asked, in the unlikely chance it is presented to someone, it usually leads to the individual wracking their brain through a myriad of memories in an attempt to decide *which* of these pivotal moments was truly the moment that their innocence and naivete was squashed. I wish I was as lucky.\n\nI grew up in a small, sleepy town in the northeastern United States. It was one of those small villages you might see on a post card or internet search, taken by a photographer who was only passing through. There was small white church steeple in the center of town, a single gas station on the corner, and miles and miles of trees surrounding it. Everyone knew everyone's name, and everyone also knew when any of the local kids were up to no good. The night I ventured into that forest, and many of the nights leading up to it, my name had been no stranger to the tongues of the townsfolk.\n\nOne particular night, my friends and I had scored a handle of Jack Daniels from my companion's older sister Melony, and were looking for a place to act more drunk than we actually were. We huddled around our lunch table that Friday morning, although to us it had the fervent discourse of a United Nations tribunal.\n\n\"No, I told you, my mom and her boyfriend are going to be home. We can't sleep at my house!\" Parker snapped frustratedly.\n\n\"But, dude, we always go to your house! Your parents probably wouldn't even care! Remember when they caught you and Anthony? They didn't even yell at you!\" David retorted.\n\n\"He is NOT my dad,\" Parker started angrily.\n\n\"That's because we weren't drunk, we were high and listening to Pink Floyd. If we're over there drunk, we're going to be loud,\" I cut in, matter-of-factly.\n\n\"But what if we're quiet?\" David begged.\n\n\"No, dude, that'll never work. Plus, I told Fiona and Jane to come,\" Edwin smirked. I felt the palms of my hands turn sweaty and my stomach churn, but I forced a less than convincing confident smile. *Girls?* I thought to myself, heart racing in excitement and a confusing fear.\n\n\"Okay, so then everyone's house is out, no way any of our parents are gonna let girls over,\" Parker slumped onto the table, defeated.\n\n\"What about- no, that won't work...\" We all took turns stabbing at the air, but came up with nothing. Until, finally, it dawned on me.\n\n\"What if we go to the woods? Get some blankets and camp in our cars? We wouldn't even have to lie to our parents!\" Edwin and Parker looked elated, but David's brow furrowed.\n\n\"The woods? Like, Starfall Wood?\"\n\n\"Yeah! What about it?\"\n\n\"Isn't...isn't that like where those kids went missing ten years ago? Not that I'm scared or anything! Just, thinking about the girls, they probably won't want to go there,\" David smiled, trying to recover. An icy silence ran over the group like a cold breeze. Half-remembered memories nudged from the back of my consciousness: police, assemblies, Mrs. Henderson taking a two week sabbatical from her job as our assistant preschool teacher to mourn. Posters EVERYWHERE.\n\n\"Dude, they'll be fine. Jane use to be a girl scout, and Fiona is Fiona! Besides, those kids were into hiking and shit. We're not going that far. And if the girls bail, they bail! I want to get blasted,\" Parker laughed, smacking David on the back. With that, and a nervous chuckle from the rest of us, it was decided.\n\n\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\n\nAfter the last bell of the day had broke, and I had swung home for some clothes, a sleeping bag, and my hidden stash of weed, it fell to me to pick up Parker and some snacks. Parker was my oldest friend out of the group. We had been friends for as long as I could remember, and troublemakers since his parent's divorce two years ago. For years now, he was looking for reasons to escape the fighting, and me my shitty step-father. Hence, we'd grown up more on the streets of our town than we had in our own homes.\n\n\"Dude, you ready for tonight?\" he grinned, hopping up into the cab of my night-purple Ford Ranger. I gave him one back.\n\n\"Almost man, Edwin said we're in charge of getting snacks.\" I put the truck into reverse and backed out of the driveway, pulling left towards the single gas station in town. As we drove, I took a second to appreciate the scenery. It was peak leaf season in New England, and the trees were a tapestry of gold, red, orange, and brown. Any day now the flood of leafers would come, buying overpriced maple syrup and tchotchkes from the small businesses in town. The air pouring through my open crank windows had a refreshing bite to them, although I worried how refreshing that bite would be tonight.\n\n\"I brought some weed tonight, too, I'm worried it's gonna go stale if I leave it too long,\" I said as we turned the corner off his street.\n\n\"Stale?\" He smirked, reaching back behind the bench seat for the cubby I usually kept it in. I smacked his hand away.\n\n\"Not until tonight man! Or at least, after the store.\" He groaned.\n\n\"Come on man, Jimmy won't care!\"\n\n\"Yeah, but what if Mr. Mayberry is working?\"\n\n\"Jimmy's dad? Gah, fuck! Fiiiine,\" Parker pouted. We soon pulled into the small parking spaces on the side of the building. The small chime of an old bell clanged from atop the establishment's only door, signaling our entrance as we pushed through into the dingy market. I only had twenty dollars left to my name after my car insurance payment earlier in the week, so we were shopping on a limited budget. Luckily for us, Jimmy was working, so our budget just stretched a little bit more.\n\nJimmy was the long, greasy haired son of the gas station owner, Mr. Mayberry. He was twenty two, a pot-head, and our supply for sub-par gas station weed. He was our idol.\n\n\"Boys! What's up? What brings you to the land of booze and honey?\" He extended a hand to dab us up over the cashier's counter. I could see as our hands meet that he was in a black decal t-shirt, with the movie poster of *The Fellowship of the Ring* printed on the face. Frodo's eyes looked up at me in a sad plea as I pulled back from the finished handshake.\n\n\"Hey Jimmy, just getting some snacks, your dad here?\" Parker asked.\n\n\"No can do, big dog. All out of bud until my guy stops by Monday,\" Jimmy answered. As they talked, I made my way back into the isles, comparing the price and flavor of several bags of chips.\n\n\"That's alright man, we're just here for snacks. We're going up to the woods tonight to go camping and get wasted,\" Parker grinned. *Just go ahead and tell the whole town, then Parker,* I thought to myself. Of course, I couldn't tell him to stop. Talking to Jimmy was a fine line, and a mis-step could lead to us cut off from our only source of weed in the entire sleepy town.\n\n\"Which woods?\" Jimmy asked inquisitively.\n\n\"Starfall Wood,\" Parker answered innocently.\n\n\"Dude, stop. You can't go in there, go down to...Evergreen Bridge. Yeah, go down to Evergreen Bridge. That's where everyone goes to party,\" Jimmy said in a serious tone.\n\n\"Nah man, that's where EVERYONE everyone goes. Someone could catch us over there. What's so bad about Starfall Wood? Like, those kids went missing, but don't people go missing all the time?\" I quietly slid next to Parker, sliding a couple bags of chips and a sad looking package of hot dogs on the counter. I placed the twenty gingerly to the side of the pile.\n\n\"Little bro, it wasn't JUST those kids. The local Apache tribes around here refused to go there, they said it was full of skin walkers and wendigos. The night those kids died, they got picked off one by one by a wendigo, until there was one left. The thing made him eat his friend, and become one itself!\" I rolled my eyes.\n\n\"Okay man, I trust you. We'll go to Evergreen Bridge. You can keep the change too,\" I butted in. Jimmy grinned and gave me a meaty fist bump, and Parker looked at me uneasily.\n\n\"Rock on, man! For real though, Evergreen Bridge is the spot. Enjoy the feast, little dudes, find me Monday!\" Jimmy called as Parker and I started to leave.\n\n\"See ya Jimmy!\" I called back as I pushed Parker out of the door.\n\n\"Dude, are we actually going to Evergreen Bridge? I gotta text Edwin,\" Parker asked once we were in the cab of my truck, the snacks secured in my truck's toolbox. There weren't any actual tools back there, but it came free with the Ranger so I used it for storage space.\n\n\"Fuck no, dude. The Apache and skin walkers are from out west, like Nevada or some shit. And if everyone died, who the hell was supposed to tell Jimmy about it?\" I watched the realization wash over Parker's face.\n\n\"Dude, Jimmy's so full of it. He's probably jealous we're getting blasted and he's working!\"\n\n\"Probably,\" I chuckled. I looked down at my phone and cursed. My heart skipped a beat as I read the text back to Parker. \"*David is out, Ant.* *Says his parents grounded him for the weekend.* *I'm almost to the woods, can you grab the girls?* *David was supposed to pick them up at the library*.\" Parker shrugged and I turned my truck around. I dropped the truck into second gear, sending us lurching into the street as I tried to race my nerves to the library.\n\n\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\n\nI lost the race. As we pulled up to the library, I could spot the two girls on a bench out front. I was suddenly thankful that they were, because neither of us had their numbers. Jane and Fiona were probably two of the few girls who would be caught dead with the likes of us. Jane was dark haired, and wore circular glasses like Harry Potter. For as long as I'd known her had a book in her hands and an attitude on her face. She always had her hair in a styled bun, an intricate braid, or straightened with precision. Fiona was the opposite: she had hair like fire, and a reckless and bubbly attitude to match. If her hair was ever dressed outside of a mass of curls, it was a half-finished messy bun. Everyone knew her as the wild child of the only Marine Corps veteran in town, who had passed down to her a proclivity for fighting. I was half certain she could kick my ass if it ever came down to it.\n\nEdwin was also madly in love with her, and he bet us each ten dollars that tonight he was going to get his first kiss. This was the third time he had made this bet, as each time before, the raven haired Jane had swooped down and snatched Fiona in the nick of time. We couldn't ever be sure if Fiona was actually into him, or just liked to watch him loose money.\n\n\"Hey ladieeess,\" Parker said in sarcastic bravado out of his window as the truck came to a stop in front of them.\n\n\"Gross,\" Jane huffed. She stood up stiffly, and Fiona gave a playful smirk to Parker before standing up herself. \"Where's David? He was supposed to pick us up,\" Jane asked as Parker hopped out of his door. She looked disdainfully at the bench seat.\n\n\"David couldn't make it, and Edwin's almost to the woods. Sorry for the tight fit,\" I said, trying to sound as casual as I could manage.\n\n\"We don't mind, do we, Jane?\" Fiona snickered, nudging her friend forward.\n\n\"Well, I am NOT sitting next to you,\" she shot an icy glare at Parker and slid into the cramped cab next to me. Fiona eagerly jumped in after her, and Parker swung the door closed. It swung hard to catch the latch, smooshing us all together on the bench made for three. I kicked the parking brake off, and with sweaty hands I pulled the steering wheel back towards the direction of the road.\n\n\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\n\nThe gravel crunched underneath my tires as we drove the last bit of dirt road to the edge of the Starfall Wood. With every bump, our bodies awkwardly jostled together in the cramped cab. Elbows jutted into sides, knees knocked together, and the occasional awkward apology was the only thing to break the silence. When we finally came to a stop, I sighed in relief to see Edwin's brown Ford Taurus sitting at the edge of the a clearing in the woods. The road we were on had taken a final turn past a cliff, and ended by seemingly spilling through a break in the trees into the meadow. Edwin waved his hand at as we stopped, marking the end of the awkward ride. He was sitting on his hood, next to the handle of his sister's whiskey and a liter of warm coke.\n\nI waited as my passengers disembarked from the clown car, and then swung my backpack to the front seat. From it's cubby, I took out the airtight bait box that held my cache of weed, and a glass pipe Jimmy had sold me at a heavy discount for my sixteenth birthday. I caught Jane's eyes staring at it, and I quickly threw it in my bag. My cheeks burned red in a way they hadn't when I had used it with Edwin and his sister last weekend. I shook off the feeling and climbed out of the cab.\n\nI opened up my toolbox and lifted out the snacks, bringing them to the tailgate of my truck. Parker had already lowered it to sit on, and I joined him there. Fiona and Jane were standing in-between the two vehicles, stances as polar as their hair.\n\n\"So, you guys want to drink?\" Ewin grinned, waving a hand to the alcohol.\n\n\"Duh! Anyone bring cups?\" Fiona asked. With a wave of his hand like a magician, Parker reached into his bag. Slowly, with showmanship, he pulled out a stack of maybe ten red solo cups.\n\n\"Swiped these bad boys from my pantry today,\" he said proudly, taking a cup and passing it around. When it got to Jane, she hesitated. \"You guys sure no one is going to find us up here?\" Edwin shook his head.\n\n\"My sister said everyone is going to be watching the finale of that stupid show that's all over Netflix. You know, the one about the 80s kids.\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" Jane sighed. She grabbed a cup and passed the stack to Fiona. Fiona, unlike her friend, grabbed one with glee. Edwin cracked the cap to the Jack, and in all of his chivalry, poured Fiona the first *gulg*. Then Jane, Parker, myself, and finally his own cup. Parker hopped up onto his feet, standing tall above us on the tailgate.\n\n\"To Edwin, for acquiring such bountiful mead! And to our home for the night, Starfall Wood! Salute!\" He called in a horrid pirate accent. The group chuckled at raised their red tankards to match. Even Jane's eyes betrayed a look of amusement. We all simultaneously took our first sip, and all simultaneously grimaced. The liquor burned the back of my throat as it went down, it's fiery warmth traveling down my esophagus and settling in my stomach.\n\n\"Monkey piss!\" Fiona cursed, and we couldn't help but laugh. I found myself watching Jane as the group's attention was on Fiona. I couldn't tell what it was at first. Maybe it was the crinkles at the corners of her sapphire eyes, the way she half hid her mouth with her cup, or the dark figure moving in the tree line behind her head.\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\nI did a double take, rubbing my eyes. There had been a large, black mass moving in the trees on the other side of the clearing. It was at least my height from what I could tell, but it was gone before I could make out it's distinct shape. Just...maybe the shape of antlers? I sat back when I realized Jane was staring back at me, eyes wide in annoyed confusion.\n\n\"What?\" she asked haughtily. I grimaced and quickly searched for words.\n\n\"I, uh, there was, uh, behind you, um...deer! Or something. There was a deer behind you, I was trying to see it, but it's gone now,\" I stammered. She rolled her eyes and glanced behind her.\n\n\"It suuuure is, Ant,\" Parker laughed from next to me. I punched him gently and took a sip from my cup. Yeah, a deer made sense. The antlers had definitely belonged to a deer.\n\n\"A deer? Awww, I wish I had seen it!\" Fiona huffed.\n\n\"Why don't we start a fire, huh? I think I have a lighter, we just need some sticks,\" Edwin stepped in, saving me. I mouthed a *thank you* to him as I got up and grabbed Parker.\n\n\"We'll get some!\" I announced, dragging him towards the group of trees next to our car, far from where I had seen the deer. We started to look for small branches, twigs, anything that might burn, but making sure we were still in eyesight of the vehicles.\n\n\"Dude, what was that?\" Parker asked when we were out of earshot.\n\n\"There really WAS something there, man,\" I blushed.\n\n\"Yeah, uh huh, Jane was!\"\n\n\"Whatever, man. Let's just make this fire, I want to smoke my whole box and forget that happened!\" I said, bending down for more sticks. Booze didn't seem to help my nerves, but weed always seemed to calm me down.\n\n\"Nah man, not anymore. I don't want to ruin this, I'm getting sooooo drunk tonight. You remember the last time I got crossed,\" he said, grabbing a small downed tree by the trunk. My nose crinkled, still smelling the vomit all these months later. \"You think this'll be big enough for the fire?\" He asked with a smirk. I shook my head, feeling slightly better.\n\n\"Sure man, let's get it back to camp.\" By the time we got the small tree dragged back to my truck, Fiona had sat down on the hood next to Edwin, and Jane had found a seat on the tailgate. Parker dropped the tree and made a bee-line for the bottle of whiskey, and I wound my way back to my cup, which was filling the seat next to Jane. There wasn't much left in it, so I finished it off with a gag.\n\n\"I'm gonna go smoke, if anyone wants to come,\" I announced to the group, in a buzzed attempt to get some space. Parker had started attacking the corpse of the tree, and Fiona and Edwin were too wrapped up in each other's conversation to answer. I sighed and shrugged, grabbing the backpack from side of my truck bed.\n\nI made my way over to a log at the edge of the last turn before the clearing. It was still in sight of the cars, but it overlooked the valley I called home my whole life. I unzipped my bag, and broke open the weed container's lid. The skunky smell filled up the air, drifting with the wind that blew gently in my face. As I packed the bowl of the pipe, I could hear the crunch of footsteps against the dirt, coming up behind me. I assumed that it was Parker after changing his mind, but was surprised to see the book in the crossed arms swing into my view. My stomach did summer saults as I realized we were alone.\n\n\"Hey, can I...?\" Jane gestured quickly to the pipe in my hand, not moving her arm from her chest.\n\n\"Yeah! Uh...yeah, here, I think there's enough room for you,\" I blushed. As she sat down, still hugging her book, I asked, \"Have you ever smoked before?\" She nodded. From the way we were facing, the last rays of the blood orange sun were dipping bellow the horizon, and coloring her face in a warm orange tinge. Still though, I swore her cheeks were more red than they had been at the start of the day.\n\n\"Yeah, I have. I don't know how people survive in this town without it.\" I handed her the pipe after I had gotten it lit, and she placed her book down in between us. I watched as the orange flame danced around the bowl, smoke curling around from the edges of her mouth. I glanced down at the title of her book while she worked.\n\n\"The Alchemist?\" I asked as I took the pipe back from her.\n\n\"What about it?\" she asked defensively as I sipped the smoke from the end of the glass tube. It's smoke, like the liquor before, burned on it's way down. The edges of my eyes began to water as I exhaled the pale smoke into the gentle wind.\n\n\"Nothing! Its, uh, a good book,\" I choked. Jane took the pipe and turned her head from the cover to the opposite end of the horizon, hiding her face from mine.\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" she muttered to herself as she took another drag. My teenage mind raced as I tried to figure out if she believed me or not.\n\n\"No, I'm serious! We read it for freshman year English,\" I said. She handed me back the pipe without looking at me, instead opting to stare out at the dying sun. From here, it's rays seemed to ignite her once black bangs, making them glow orange like burning steel.\n\n\"Okay, then what's your favorite part?\" she tested. I took a long, slow drag and tried to think as deeply as I could. I wanted to tell her a portion of the book that would convince her and impress her at the same time. I held in the smoke as I thought, and smoothly coughed up a lung as I let it out. I decided to go with the truth.\n\n\"The end, I think. Where he finds the treasure back in the church he had the dream? I liked how it all went full circle at the end, and that the real treasure is your home,\" I said as I passed her back the pipe. Jane laughed, an unexpected chime that rattled the lull that the encroaching twilight was bringing. I smiled hesitantly, asking, \"What?\" Her body still angled away from me, but she looked at me for the first time since sitting on the log.\n\n\"That is NOT the point of that, but I'm impressed that you actually read it,\" she scoffed and picked up the book.\n\n\"Then what is it?\" I asked as I watched her intently.\n\n\"The point is that that he could never have found the treasure without the journey. He's a different man because he traveled all that way, and did all those things, and came back changed. That's what I want to do. Go on a journey like that! Past the mountains and all these damn hills.\" Smoke curled out of her mouth like an upwardly flowing waterfall as she spoke. I looked where she was looking: over the horizon. I had never truly thought about it before, just understood the concept that yes, those places exist. But never that they existed past those mountains, and that I would have to leave to get to them. I shuddered at the thought.\n\n\"Is that your favorite part? When he leaves?\" I asked her.\n\n\"No, because then he just gets stuck selling rocks. My favorite part is when he leaves with the Alchemist, when he has to leave Fatima and the tribe behind. That's when he REALLY leaves, and gets to learn all the secrets of the world.\"\n\n\"When you do, you mind writing them back to me?\" I asked. She giggled, and the cold breeze didn't seem so cold.\n\n\"That's not really the point, but sure.\" I blushed and scooted a foot next to hers, and she didn't move it. I looked her in the eyes again, and the early dusk stars seemed to sparkle off them. I was so lost in them, I almost didn't hear the footsteps rushing up behind us.\n\n\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\n\n\"GUYS GUYS GUYS!\" The drunken shouts of Parker jarred me out of the trace I was in with Jane. She seemed to snap out of it, too, and dashed her foot away from mine. I was going to kill him for that.\n\n\"What?\" I asked angrily, whipping my head around. Parker was drunk already. I could tell by the sideways way he ran at us, and the half-finished bottle of Jack in his hand. When I turned to his face, though, it was smeared in worry and fear.\n\n\"Something took them! Edwin and Fiona! They're gone!\" Jane stood up fast and I rolled my eyes.\n\n\"Fucking idiots!\" She huffed and strode back toward the camp. Parker shimmed over in front of her to stop her.\n\n\"Dude, they probably just went to go make out, its okay!\" I said to him, trying to calm him down.\n\n\"Move, dork!\" Jane commanded Parker. He didn't budge and shook his head dizzily.\n\n\"Wait, wait! No, listen, they were sitting right there, I mean RIGHT THERE, and then I went around the back of the car to piss, and, and there was this like trumpet sound dude, it was weird, and I turned around and they were gone! You guys didn't hear it?\" I looked at Jane and we both shook our heads.\n\n\"Let's go check the camp, Parker,\" I said softly, trying to guide him back to the way he came. He looked at me desperately, eyes wide as saucers.\n\n\"Dude, please,\" he begged. I grabbed him by the arm and eased him towards the cars. Jane was already ahead of us, speed walking to the distant flicker of the campfire that had been built in our absence. Jane entered our camp first, looking into the cars and under them as I helped Parker sit down on the end of my tailgate. As Jane searched, she became more and more frantic.\n\n\"Where is she? Where is Fiona? Answer me, Parker!\" Jane shouted at him, striding up and stopping just in front of him, her hands on her hips like an angry mother would.\n\n\"I told you, I don't know! I didn't see them even get up! We...we need to get out of here, man, something is fucking wrong here! We're all gonna end up like those kids!\" Parker moaned and buried his face in his hands in drunken frustration. As they argued, I walked to the spot the two had been sitting. The car was undisturbed, as were their drinks. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight, waving it around. My light settled on the dirt bellow the hood. There was a mess of footprints where they had been resting their feet, and long smoothed lines before that where Parker and I had drug the tree over. And yet...\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I said under my breath. There, in the middle of the smoothed path Parker and I had cleared maybe thirty minutes before, were hoof prints. Just two, side by side in the middle of the tree marks, facing the hood of Edwin's car.\n\n\"Wha, what, what the fuck?\" I repeated a little louder, backing up.\n\n\"What? Did you find something?\" Jane asked, rushing over. I held out an arm to stop her from going over the tracks.\n\n\"Parker's right, there's something fucked going on here. Look at those! In the tree marks!\" I said in an almost whisper. Jane ducked under my arm and crouched down, examining the tracks.\n\n\"Parker, you sure there wasn't a deer or anything that came through the camp?\" I asked him. He looked over to me, eyes wide with confused worry.\n\n\"I mean, there was that sound? Can deer make sounds? I didn't see any deer, fuck you'd think I woulda mentioned that already?\" He answered in a slur.\n\n\"We need to find them, and get out of here. Like, NOW.\" I turned to the woods, scanning the tree line for any sign of life. Even with the bright luminescence of the moon and the last of the dying color of the sky, the woods seemed to be an inky black.\n\n\"What are you so freaked out about? The fucking deer prints? Yeah, it's the WOODS, Anthony,\" Jane said, standing back up. I shook my head and strode back next to her, pointing at the dirt at our feet.\n\n\"There's only TWO, Jane! Look at how they're facing! Look how far apart they are! They're in a fucking line like a person! Fuck, we might have to call the cops!\"\n\n\"Cops?\" Parker asked weakly from the truck bed. In the lull between his question and my response, I heard it. We all did. A long, high pitched bugling from the edge of the forest. It washed over the clearing and through us like a wave, finding it's way into every crack and crevasse of our beings. Every hair on my body stood at end, and I felt Jane's hand grab my own as she shot up. We all remained motionless, the bugle cracking all three of our wills simultaneously. When it finally faded, as if by some unspoken agreement, I tugged at Jane and we scrambled after Parker into my truck. I threw her in the middle and climbed in after, fumbling with my keys. I gasped for air as I found the key to the truck and jammed it into the ignition.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Jane yelled, pulling my wrist back. Again, I tried for the ignition.\n\n\"Getting us the fuck out of here! What do you mean?\" I responded desperately.\n\n\"Lock the doors, man! Lock the doors!\" Parker interjected over our bickering, slamming the door lock on his side with the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Fiona? And Edwin?\" I looked back up at her. She wore a mask of anger, but bubbling to the surface from under it was fear. It welled up at the corners of her lips, and wet the her eyes. I took a shaky breathe. She was right. By the time a cop could get up here, they could be gone.\n\n\"Fuck, fuck, okay. How about this, we turn the truck on, but we do a lap of the field with the headlights? I, I have four wheel drive, and no one has to get out of the car. Deal?\" Jane pursed her lips and nodded wiping a tear away with one arm, and let my hand go. \"Parker?\" I asked him. He hugged his arms around his chest.\n\n\"Fuck man, fine, but after that, after that we go? And no one gets out?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man. Lets just fucking do this,\" I said, turning the ignition switch. With her normal rattle, the danger ranger roared to life. I grabbed the 4 wheel drive selector and jammed it to 4 HI. I started us forward, turning towards the right side of the clearing and switching on the brights. The headlights penetrated deep into the woods, but there was nothing. We started to circle the clearing, the silence only abated by shaky breathing. We made a wide circle, slowing to a near stop at points so I could navigate the field, while Parker and Jane stared out the windshield and side window intently. No matter how hard we squinted, though, there was no sign of our friends. With anxious disappointment, I turned the truck back around to the side of the clearing that lead back to the road. I realized with horror that it wasn't as clear as it was before we had started.\n\nStanding at the mouth of the clearing, silhouetted in the rising moon's light, was an elk. It was a massive bull, with towering antlers and glinting eyes that almost seemed to glow from the reflection of my high beams.\n\n\"Oh, fuck,\" I breathed.\n\n\"Dude, is, is that a deer?\" Parker stammered, moving around frantically with no real discernable goal.\n\n\"I'm just high, I'm just high, I'm just high,\" Jane repeated to herself, each time her voice cracking just a little bit more. She grabbed at her hair with her hands frantically, and I put a hand on her knee to try and steady her.\n\n\"What the fuck do we do?\" I asked aloud.\n\n\"Uhh, fuck, uh, uh, maybe drive around it?\" Parker whispered. I nodded and put the truck back into first, creeping in the direction of the forest giant.\n\n\"Do you two not fucking get it? Or are you too stupid?\" Jane snapped.\n\n\"Okay, your attitude is NOT helping,\" Paul slurred.\n\n\"Uuugh, that's an elk, you idiot! AN ELK! When was the last time there was an elk in the northeast? Eighteen-fucking-hundred!\" She hissed. The truck continued forward, slowly revealing more and more of the defiant creature ahead of us. When we got about thirty feet away, the truck suddenly stalled next to the smoldering remains of the fire that Parker had built. The lights cut off, and the only light now seemed to come from the moon high up in the sky.\n\n\"Shit!\" I cursed, frantically jimmying the key. Nothing. I tried stepping on the clutch, tapping the gas, moving the stick to neutral, but nothing worked. Defeated, I turned back to the elk. We stared at it for a moment, before it let out an audible *gruff* and pushed itself up onto it's hind legs. A quick shriek slipped past Jane's lips before she clamped a hand down over her own mouth.\n\nThe elk towered above the truck, with unnatural balance. It continued to stare down at us, unmoving. The cold night's air condensed it's breath, making the wispy exhales of steam emanating from it's nostrils appear to be dragon's smoke. It snorted, and it's mouth opened. I braced, expecting another shrill trumpeting blast, but I heard something far more unnerving.\n\n\"*Yeladim, ha-yareach do'ech*\" The words rattled deep through all of us, the notes akin to the deep base of a shockwave. We sat, stunned, too afraid to move. The silence that followed was so deafening that I could hear Jane's heart beat next to me. The great beast moved towards the truck with an unnaturally steady gate, the only lateral movement being the hairs of it's massive neck.\n\n\"Goddamnitgoddamnitgodamnit!\" I panicked, finally freeing my hand from it's paralysis and trying for the ignition. Still, there was nothing, not even the clicking of the starter relay.\n\n\"Come on!\" Jane shouted at me, finding her voice.\n\n\"I'm trying here!\" I shouted back. I frantically worked, while the beast closed the distance between itself and the driver's side door. It was useless, and I turned to see the elk stoop down to meet my gaze, staying on it's hind legs. It's eyes leveled with mine, and I saw them in all their detail. They had the normal, horizontal pupil of a prey animal, but these were sat in a deep maroon iris. They stared at me unfeelingly, as if they didn't see something that they particularly hated, feared, or loved. If this thing wanted to kill us, it was because it was a chore.\n\nFrom behind me, I heard my passenger door open. Then, a bump on the roof over us. The elk stiffened and stood up straight, and I followed it's gaze. Although I couldn't see Parker dangling from the open door from the angle I was at, I could hear his drunken response to the situation.\n\n\"Fuck you, deer!\" There was the sound of broken glass and a quick *whoosh* as my vision erupted in flames. The elk roared, sending a flaming hoof punching through my window. Glass exploded onto Jane and I as heat flooded the cab. I desperately tried the ignition, and said the world's fastest prayer as the turned over. I punched it, right as Parker slung back into the cab. I didn't look back, stomping on the gas even harder. Jane held onto Parker by his waist until he could get the door closed. As we took the first turn by the log that had seemed so peaceful not an hour before, I looked back, and saw the fiery silhouette of the elk standing at the edge of the clearing.

His fingers, pale and trembling, kept tugging at the frayed cuffs of his prison jumpsuit. He looked like a man who hadn't slept in days—worn down by something much deeper than exhaustion. It was fear. And something else.\n\nI leaned forward, keeping my voice calm and controlled. \"You said it started with a crack?\"\n\nJack nodded slowly, barely meeting my gaze. \"Yeah,\" he mumbled. \"Just a crack in the wall. That's how it all began.\"\n\nHe paused, running a hand through his hair, and for a moment, I thought he wasn't going to say anything else. Then he took a shaky breath, his eyes distant, like he was trying to relive those first few days in his mind. \"Solitary's always been a mess,\" he continued, voice hoarse. \"The walls in there—cracked, dirty. You get used to it. It's like the whole place is rotting from the inside out. You stop noticing after a while. Mold in the corners, cracks everywhere... normal stuff for a place like that.\"\n\nHis fingers drummed absently on the table, the sound sharp in the otherwise quiet room. \"I noticed the crack in my cell a few days before everything started. It was small, maybe three or four inches, right down by the corner where the wall meets the floor. Nothing unusual, right? These walls were falling apart all over the place, so I didn't pay much attention at first.\"\n\nHe looked up, his brow furrowed as if trying to decide how to explain what happened next. \"But the next day, it wasn't just a crack anymore. There was… something growing out of it. Black stuff. I thought it was mold. That's what you'd think, right? This place isn't exactly sanitary.\"\n\nJack took a deep breath, his fingers tapping faster now, more erratic. \"It didn't move, at least not that I could see. But every time I looked at it, it seemed like there was more of it. I swear to God, it was spreading. Slow. Maybe six inches a day. I couldn't see it move, but when I'd wake up in the morning, it had crept further along the wall, like it was crawling while I was sleeping.\"\n\nI wrote down the details and looked back up. \"You're saying it was growing that fast? Just overnight?\"\n\nJack nodded, his voice growing more agitated. \"Yeah. I'd wake up, and there'd be more of it. Not much at first—just a few more inches, but I could tell it was moving. The crack was getting wider, too. And it wasn't just mold. I knew it wasn't mold, not with the way it looked. It wasn't just sitting there on the surface. It was alive.\"\n\nHis voice grew quieter, as though he wasn't sure if he should be saying the words out loud. \"It was like it was breathing.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrow but kept my expression neutral. \"What made you think that?\"\n\nJack shifted in his seat, eyes darting toward the walls of the room before fixing on the table. \"It wasn't just that it was spreading. It was how it made the room feel. Different. Like the air was heavier. It smelled wrong, too. Not like the usual mold or dampness. This was something else. It smelled like… like something rotting. Foul. The kind of smell that makes you gag.\"\n\nHe paused, rubbing his fingers against his temples, trying to recall every detail. \"I told the guards the second day, right when I noticed it had spread. The guy dropping off food just shrugged it off. Said he'd file a report, but I knew he wouldn't. Why would he? It's solitary. They don't care what happens in there as long as we stay quiet.\"\n\nJack's fingers clenched into fists, knuckles turning white. \"So I waited. Figured maybe someone would check it out. But no one came. And each morning, when I woke up, the black stuff had spread a little more. Not fast enough to notice while it was happening, but enough that I knew it was growing.\"\n\nHis voice lowered, his eyes widening slightly as he recounted those days. \"By the third day, it had covered the entire corner of the wall. The crack had gotten bigger, and the black stuff—it wasn't just growing anymore. It was feeding. It had to be. There was no other explanation for how it was spreading so steadily. Every morning, it was a few inches closer. And the smell kept getting worse.\"\n\nHe ran his hands through his hair again, his face etched with frustration and fear. \"I kept telling the guards. Every time they walked by, I'd bang on the door and shout that something was wrong. They thought I was losing it and told me to shut up and deal with it. But I wasn't crazy. That stuff was real, and it was spreading.\"\n\nJack took a deep breath, his voice dropping almost to a whisper. \"I wasn't imagining it. I know what I saw.\"\n\nThe room felt heavier, his words sinking in like stones. He paused, waiting for my response, but I let the silence stretch, giving him time to collect himself. Finally, I asked, \"What happened after the third day? Did it stop?\"\n\nJack shook his head, his voice wavering. \"No. It didn't stop. It just kept growing, slow but steady.\"\n\nJack took another shaky breath, his fingers tapping nervously against the table. He looked around the room again, like he was searching for something that wasn't there, then rubbed his face with both hands. I could tell he was trying to push back the memories, but they kept clawing their way to the surface.\n\n\"It kept spreading,\" he muttered, his voice strained. \"Every morning, I'd wake up, and that black stuff was a little closer. Six inches, maybe more, every damn day. The crack, too—it was getting bigger like something was trying to push its way out from behind the wall.\"\n\nHe stopped, staring at the ceiling for a moment, then shook his head. \"I couldn't take it anymore. I started banging on the door, yelling at the guards every time they passed. I told them the black stuff was spreading and that the crack was getting worse. They didn't believe me. They just looked at me like I was crazy.\"\n\nHis hands clenched into fists. \"I wasn't crazy. I knew what I saw. But to them, I was just another inmate trying to get out of solitary. They told me to calm down and that someone would come check it out, but no one ever did. Not for days.\"\n\nJack's voice dropped lower. \"By the fourth day, I could barely breathe in there. The smell… it was like something had died in the walls. Worse than that. It was foul, like the whole room was rotting from the inside out.\"\n\nHe stared down at his hands. \"And I could feel it. In my bones, you know? Like something was wrong with the air itself. It felt thick and heavy like it was pressing down on me. I couldn't sleep anymore. I'd lie awake at night, staring at that black stuff creeping along the wall, knowing it was getting closer.\"\n\nJack paused, shaking his head again like he was trying to clear the memory. \"I begged them. Every time a guard walked by, I begged them to move me, to get me out of that cell. They ignored me. Days passed. The black stuff kept growing. I could feel it getting closer, but they didn't care.\"\n\nHe let out a bitter laugh, the sound hollow. \"It wasn't until the lawsuit threats started flying that they decided to move me. They couldn't risk me going to a lawyer, saying they were keeping me in a contaminated cell. So, they moved me.\"\n\nI watched him carefully. \"Where did they take you?\"\n\n\"To another cell in solitary,\" Jack muttered. \"A dirtier one, if you can believe that. No black stuff, though. But I could still see my old cell from the window in my door, just a few doors down. I'd look at it every day, but I couldn't see the fungus. Not yet.\"\n\nHis voice dropped, barely a whisper now. \"I wasn't the only one in solitary anymore. They put someone else in my old cell.\"\n\nJack stared at the table, his face tight with anxiety. \"At first, I didn't hear much about him. The guards didn't talk to me after I was moved. But after a few days, I started to overhear things. Little bits and pieces. They said the guy they put in my old cell… he'd touched the black stuff. They had to move him to the med wing.\"\n\nHe stopped, rubbing his hands together as if trying to warm them. \"I didn't know what had happened to him at first. Just that he was unconscious, and they didn't think he'd wake up. Then the rumors started.\"\n\nJack's eyes darkened, his voice lowering. \"They said his skin was changing. One of the guards said it looked like it was blistering, like something was eating him from the inside out. Another said his veins were turning black, like the stuff was crawling under his skin.\"\n\nI scribbled down notes, glancing up at Jack. \"How long after they moved you did this happen?\"\n\nHe shrugged, his voice distant. \"A couple of days, maybe. Not long. Whatever was in that cell, it got him fast.\"\n\nJack's hand shook slightly as he continued. \"I started hearing more after that. The guards didn't want to talk about it, but I could tell they were scared. They were trying to keep it quiet, but everyone knew something was wrong. The guy they put in my old cell… he wasn't just sick. He was changing.\"\n\nJack shifted in his chair, his eyes narrowing slightly as if the memory of what came next still gnawed at him. \"It wasn't long after that when things started changing. I could feel it—something was happening in that place. The guards… they stopped talking. Just did their rounds without saying a word. No more gossip, no more jokes. Nothing.\"\n\nHe paused, his fingers drumming nervously on the table. \"The guy in the med wing… they said he wasn't getting better. They'd quarantined him and locked the whole wing down. That's when they started wearing those suits. You know, the ones they wear when there's a biohazard. Full suits, gloves, masks. I couldn't even see their faces anymore.\"\n\nJack's voice grew more agitated. \"When they came to drop off my meals, they wouldn't look at me. Just shoved the tray through the slot and walked away. I tried asking them what was going on, but they didn't answer. They didn't say a damn thing. It was like I didn't exist anymore.\"\n\nI watched him carefully, jotting down notes as he spoke. \"Did you see anything unusual from your cell during this time?\"\n\nJack nodded slowly, his eyes flicking up toward the small window in the door. \"Yeah. I started watching my old cell more closely. I couldn't see the black stuff at first, not from where I was. But after a few days… I saw it.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"The fungus. It was spreading, creeping along the walls of my old cell. I could see it through the window. It had covered almost the whole corner by then, and the crack—it was bigger, a lot bigger. I couldn't see it move, but every day, it was a little further along, a little darker, like it was eating away at the walls.\"\n\nJack swallowed hard, rubbing his hands together again. \"And the smell… even from where I was, I could smell it. Like rot, like something festering. It made my stomach turn every time I caught a whiff of it.\"\n\nHe shook his head slowly, his voice growing more desperate. \"I kept banging on the door, shouting at the guards, asking what the hell was going on. They wouldn't tell me anything. Just dropped off the meals and left. No one spoke to me anymore. It was like the whole place had gone silent.\"\n\nJack's eyes met mine, wide with fear. \"That's when I knew. Whatever was happening in that prison—it wasn't just some sickness. It was something else. Something worse.\"\n\nJack's voice wavered as he continued, the fear evident in every word. \"A couple more days passed, and that's when the real shit hit the fan. They stopped delivering meals on time. One day, nothing. No food, no guards. Just silence. And I knew something had happened. I could feel it in the air.\"\n\nHe rubbed his arms as if trying to shake off a chill. \"I kept looking out my window, trying to see anything. But the hall was empty. No one came by, no sounds, nothing. It was like I'd been forgotten.\"\n\nJack paused, his voice trembling slightly. \"And then I heard the screaming.\"\n\nHis eyes grew wide as he relived the moment. \"It wasn't loud—solitary's far enough from the main wings that you don't hear much—but I heard it. Faint, like it was coming from down the hall, near the med wing. Someone was shouting, panicked like they were fighting something. I didn't know what was happening, but I knew it wasn't good.\"\n\nJack's breath hitched, and he gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white. \"That's when I saw them. The guards—they were running. I've never seen them run before, not like that. They were trying to get out of the med wing, but something was wrong. One of them looked terrified, and I could hear them shouting at each other. Then… silence.\"\n\nHe stared at the table, eyes wide and unblinking. \"That's when I heard the footsteps.\"\n\nJack's breath quickened as he continued. \"They were heavy, dragging, like something was limping down the hall. I rushed to the window, trying to see what it was, but the hall was still empty. The sound grew louder and closer, and I swear, it was coming from the direction of the med wing. Whatever was making those footsteps—it wasn't walking like a person.\"\n\nHe paused, his fingers gripping the edge of the table so tightly that his knuckles turned white. \"I heard the guards again. They were shouting something about getting the doors open. I didn't know what was happening, but I knew they were scared. And that scared me.\"\n\nJack looked up at me, his eyes wide with fear. \"I saw one of them. A guard, running down the hall. He was heading toward my cell, fumbling with the keys, trying to unlock the door. He kept looking back like something was chasing him.\"\n\nHe swallowed hard, his voice shaking. \"I didn't see it at first, but I heard it. This… wet, squelching sound, like something dragging across the floor. And then I saw it. The thing they'd put in the med wing. It wasn't human anymore. It was… changed.\"\n\nJack's hands shook as he spoke, and I could see the fear in his eyes, the memory of that moment burning like a fresh wound. \"I couldn't move. I just stood there, staring at it. The thing… it wasn't human anymore. I don't even know if it remembered being human.\"\n\nHis voice cracked, his breath uneven. \"It was big—taller than I remembered the prisoner being like it had been stretched somehow. Its skin, if you could even call it that anymore, was swollen, bulging in places like it was filled with something. The black fungus had grown over most of its body, but it wasn't just on the surface. You could see it moving underneath, crawling through its veins, thick and dark. Its skin was splitting in places, oozing this… thick, black liquid. Parts of it looked like they were rotting, but it was still alive.\"\n\nJack leaned forward, his voice dropping as he described the creature in horrifying detail. \"The worst part was its face. The fungus had taken over most of it, but I could still see parts of what used to be a man—his mouth was hanging open, slack like it had forgotten how to close. His eyes… God, his eyes. They were completely black, not just the pupils but the whole thing. Like they'd been swallowed by the darkness inside him.\"\n\nJack's hands gripped the table, his knuckles white. \"It wasn't just the way it looked. It moved wrong, too. Like its bones had been broken and put back together in the wrong order. Its arms were too long, its legs bent in ways that didn't make sense. It didn't walk so much as lurch, dragging one foot behind the other. Every step it took made this wet, squelching sound like the fungus was eating away at it from the inside out.\"\n\nHe paused, staring at the floor, his voice growing weaker. \"It smelled, too. Like rot. Like meat left out too long. The air around it was thick with the stench, and I could barely breathe. I don't know how the guard could stand being that close.\"\n\nJack swallowed hard, eyes wide. \"He almost had the door open. I was right there, watching through the window, and I could see him fumbling with the keys, trying to get the lock undone. His hands were shaking so bad, I thought he'd drop the keys.\"\n\nHis voice trembled as he continued. \"He was muttering to himself, saying something about needing to get me out. I don't even think he saw the thing coming for him until it was too late.\"\n\nJack squeezed his eyes shut as if trying to block out the memory. \"The door clicked open. He finally got it. I thought for a second I was going to make it, but that thing… it was right behind him. It grabbed him before he even had a chance to run.\"\n\nJack's voice faltered, barely above a whisper. \"I've never seen anything like it. The way it grabbed him—like it didn't even care. It just… tore into him. Its hands, if you can even call them that, were these twisted claws, black and dripping with whatever the fungus had turned it into. It sank them into his chest like they were cutting through butter.\"\n\nHe shook his head, eyes distant. \"He didn't scream. Not even once. One second, he was there, and the next… he wasn't. Just blood. Everywhere. The thing was ripping him apart, tearing chunks out of him like it was feeding. And I just stood there, watching, too scared to move.\"\n\nJack took a deep breath, his voice still shaking. \"I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like forever. But after it was done, it didn't even look at me. It just turned and started dragging his body down the hall, like it didn't have any purpose like it was just following some mindless instinct.\"\n\nHis hands were still trembling, Jack lifted his head slightly, and his voice was growing faint. \"And then… it left.\"\n\nJack's breathing was shaky as he continued, his hands still trembling slightly from the memory. \"I thought it was over. I thought once it killed the guard, I'd be next. But it didn't even look at me. It just dragged the body down the hall.\"\n\nHis voice wavered, growing more desperate as he relived the moment. \"The fungus… it had spread. I hadn't noticed it before, not like that. I could see it now, seeping out from under the door of my old cell, black tendrils creeping into the hallway. It had gotten bigger—much bigger. Thick, dark strands covered the walls near the cell, growing into the cracks, spreading further and faster than I'd ever seen.\"\n\nJack swallowed hard, his voice shaking. \"The thing—it dragged the guard's body right up to the spot where the fungus was leaking out into the hall. I thought maybe it was going to leave him there, but… no. It did something worse.\"\n\nHe looked down at the table as if ashamed of what he'd seen. \"It shoved the guard's body into the fungus. Just… pushed him right into it like the wall wasn't even there anymore. The black stuff—those tendrils—they wrapped around him, pulling him deeper like it was absorbing him.\"\n\nJack's voice grew quieter, his fear palpable. \"I could see it. The fungus spread over the guard's body, crawling over his skin and covering him like a web. His face—what was left of it—disappeared into the black mass, and then the wall… the wall seemed to eat him. It pulled him in until all I could see was this black mound stuck to the wall like it was holding him there.\"\n\nHe stared at the floor, eyes wide. \"It was like the fungus had claimed him like it was feeding off of him. The more it wrapped around him, the bigger it got, spreading faster now, reaching further along the hallway.\"\n\nJack paused, his breath catching in his throat. \"And then the thing… the thing that killed him—it started eating.\"\n\nHis voice faltered, his eyes wide with terror. \"It crouched down right by the spot where the fungus was growing the thickest. And then it started tearing chunks of it off—big, wet chunks of black mold—and shoving it into its mouth. It was like it was starving for it like it needed the fungus to survive.\"\n\nJack's body shook, his hands clenching into fists. \"I couldn't watch. It was… it was eating the fungus like it was meat, like it was devouring something alive. And the more it ate, the more the fungus seemed to spread. I could see the walls pulsing, like they were alive like the whole damn place was breathing.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, his voice barely a whisper. \"I don't know what it was. I don't know if it was still the prisoner or something else entirely. But whatever it was, it wasn't human anymore. It was part of the fungus, part of whatever was growing inside the walls.\"\n\nJack's breath hitched, his eyes wide. \"I was too scared to move. I just watched as it fed.\"\n\nJack's voice was quieter now, but there was a tension in every word. \"I don't know how long I stood there, watching it eat. I was too scared to move, too scared to breathe. I thought if I made a sound, it would turn around, and I'd be next.\"\n\nHe swallowed hard, staring at the table as if seeing that moment again. \"But eventually… it stopped. The thing just stood up, slow, like it had all the time in the world. I thought for sure it would notice me then, but it didn't. It just turned, shuffling down the hall back toward the med wing. The fungus was still spreading behind it, creeping further down the walls.\"\n\nJack took a shaky breath, his hands clenching and unclenching as he continued. \"That was my chance. The door was unlocked. I didn't want to go out there, but I knew I couldn't stay in the cell. Not with that thing out there. Not with the fungus spreading.\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes wide, still rattled by the memory. \"So I opened the door. As quietly as I could, I slipped out into the hallway. The place smelled worse than ever—like the air itself was rotting. The walls… they were breathing, pulsing with the black fungus. It had spread further since the last time I looked, covering the doors, the cracks, creeping along the floor.\"\n\nHis voice wavered, fear threading through his words. \"I didn't know where to go. The hall was empty. No guards, no prisoners. Just me. I thought about heading back to the main wings, but I didn't know if anyone else was still alive. I didn't know if the fungus had spread to the rest of the prison.\"\n\nJack rubbed his temples, trying to push back the panic that still clung to his voice. \"The sound… I couldn't get it out of my head. The walls were making this wet, squelching noise. Every time the fungus pulsed, it sounded like something living was inside the walls, moving with it. Like the prison itself was infected.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, eyes wide with fear. \"I kept moving, but it was slow. I was terrified of making too much noise. I didn't know if that thing was still out there, and I wasn't going to take any chances. I stuck close to the walls, avoiding the patches of black mold that were creeping up from the cracks in the floor. The whole place felt… wrong. It felt alive.\"\n\nHis hands trembled as he spoke, the fear in his voice growing. \"I made my way through the hallway, past the other cells. Some of them were still locked. I could hear things inside, but I didn't stop to listen. I couldn't afford to. I just kept going, trying to get as far away from that thing as I could.\"\n\nJack swallowed hard. \"I don't know how long I walked before I reached the door to the main wing. I thought maybe I'd find someone. Another guard, maybe. But the door… it was locked. No way out.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, his eyes darting to the camera in the corner of the room. \"I was trapped.\"\n\nHe rubbed his hands over his face, his voice trembling. \"That's when I heard it. The creature—the thing that killed the guard. It was coming back. I could hear its footsteps, that slow, wet shuffle, dragging something along the floor. I knew it was coming for me this time.\"\n\nHis hands clenched the edge of the table. \"I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I looked around, trying to find somewhere to hide, but there was nothing. The fungus was everywhere, crawling along the floor, the walls… I could hear it pulsing. I thought I could feel it inside my head, beating like a second heartbeat.\"\n\nJack swallowed hard, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"And then I saw it. An air vent, just above the door. It was small, barely big enough for me to squeeze through, but it was my only option. I climbed up, using the edge of the door for leverage, and pulled the grate off the vent. It wasn't quiet, but the creature… it didn't seem to care. It just kept coming.\"\n\nHe took a shaky breath. \"I shoved myself inside the vent, trying not to make too much noise. I could hear it below me, dragging itself closer. I could feel the heat from its body, the smell of rot filling the air. I didn't dare look down. I just kept crawling, inch by inch, through that narrow space, praying it wouldn't hear me.\"\n\nJack rubbed his hands together, the tension clear in his body. \"I don't know how long I crawled through those vents. It felt like forever. I could hear the fungus growing inside the walls, like it was alive, spreading through the ducts. But eventually, I found another opening.\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes wide. \"I didn't know where I was anymore. The prison was like a maze, but I knew I had to get out. I climbed out of the vent and dropped down into another hallway. This one was quieter and cleaner. I could hear voices in the distance. Someone was talking. It wasn't a guard. It sounded… official.\"\n\nJack's fingers trembled slightly. \"That's when I saw them. Federal agents. They were wearing protective suits, walking through the hallway, and talking into radios. I tried to call out to them, but my voice was barely a whisper. I was weak, starving, and my body felt like it was shutting down.\"\n\nHe rubbed his face, his voice quieter now. \"One of them saw me. They turned and pointed, and the others came running. They grabbed me, lifted me up, and I blacked out after that. When I woke up, I was here.\"\n\nThe room was quiet for a moment as Jack finished his story. He stared down at his hands, pale and trembling, the words hanging in the air like a thick fog. I watched him carefully, my mind turning over the details of what he'd said. The transformed prisoner, the fungus, the guards… it all lined up with the reports, but something felt off.\n\nI glanced at my notes, then back at Jack. \"You said the fungus was in the walls. That it was everywhere. Do you think it spread beyond the prison?\"\n\nJack hesitated, his fingers twitching slightly. \"I don't know. It was moving fast. If it's still there, it's probably spread even further by now.\"\n\nI tapped my pen against the table, considering my next question. \"What about you? Did you come into contact with the fungus?\"\n\nJack's eyes flickered toward the camera in the corner of the room, his expression tightening. \"No,\" he said quickly. \"I stayed away from it. I made sure.\"\n\nI watched him closely, noting the tension in his voice. \"You're sure? No spores, no mold on your skin?\"\n\nJack's hands clenched into fists, his voice dropping. \"I said I didn't touch it.\"\n\nBut something was wrong. I could see it now, in the way he moved, the way his skin looked under the harsh fluorescent light. There were small, barely noticeable black spots on his hands, like tiny cracks forming just beneath the surface. His fingernails were chipped and discolored, and there was a faint sheen of sweat on his forehead.\n\nI leaned forward slightly. \"Jack… are you feeling all right?\"\n\nHe didn't answer at first. He stared down at his hands, his breath growing shallow. His fingers twitched again, and then I saw it—just the slightest movement. The skin on his knuckles shifted, bulging for a moment, like something was crawling underneath.\n\nJack's eyes widened, his breath quickening. \"No… no, this isn't happening. I didn't… I didn't touch it.\"\n\nBut the evidence was clear now. His skin was changing, dark veins spreading slowly under the surface. The fungus had gotten to him. I could see the horror in his eyes as the realization hit him.\n\nHe backed away from the table, his voice trembling. \"You've got to help me. I can feel it—under my skin. It's spreading.\"\n\nI stood up, reaching for the door, but Jack grabbed my arm, his grip weak but desperate. \"Please. Don't let it take me. Don't let me turn into one of them.\"\n\nI pulled away, calling for the other agents. The door swung open, and they rushed in, their eyes wide as they saw the black veins creeping up Jack's arms.\n\nHe collapsed to the floor, shaking, his breath ragged. \"It's too late,\" he whispered. \"It's already inside me.\"\n\nAnd then, as the agents restrained him, I saw the first crack in his skin. The black tendrils were already spreading.\n\nAfter Jack was restrained and taken away, I sat there in silence, my mind racing. His story was almost too terrifying to believe, but the black veins spreading under his skin told me that something far worse than we could have imagined had happened in that prison.\n\nThe medical team rushed Jack out of the room, and I made my way to the surveillance office. The tapes from the prison's security cameras had been pulled, but I knew where I needed to start: the med bay. Jack had mentioned the prisoner who had been quarantined there—the one who had touched the fungus. If I was going to understand what we were dealing with, I needed to see what had happened to him.\n\nI sat down in front of the monitor and loaded the med bay footage. The timestamp matched the days Jack had been talking about, right around the time they had moved him to a new cell and put the infected prisoner in his old one. The screen flickered to life, showing the sterile, dimly lit interior of the med bay.\n\nAt first, the footage seemed ordinary. The prisoner lay on the bed, motionless, connected to machines that were monitoring his vitals. Two guards stood nearby, occasionally glancing at him but not paying much attention. It all looked normal—until the prisoner's body twitched.\n\nI leaned forward, watching closely. The prisoner shifted again, his arms jerking slightly, his head rolling to one side. At first, it looked like he was waking up, but something was wrong. His movements were erratic and unnatural. The guards noticed it, too; they stepped closer to the bed, exchanging nervous glances.\n\nAnd then, it began.\n\nThe prisoner's body convulsed, his back arching off the bed as if something inside him was forcing its way out. His skin started to blister, bulging in grotesque patterns, as if something was crawling underneath. The guards rushed toward him, shouting for help, but it was too late.\n\nI watched in horror as the black veins spread beneath the prisoner's skin, creeping up from his hands, his arms, his neck—everywhere. His face twisted in pain, his mouth opening in a silent scream, but no sound came out. His eyes… turned black, completely black, as if the darkness inside him had consumed everything.\n\nThe guards panicked. One of them backed away while the other tried to restrain the prisoner, but the prisoner was no longer human. His body was contorted, his arms bending at impossible angles, his skin cracking open to reveal the black fungal growth underneath. It spread across his body like wildfire, taking over every inch of him.\n\nThen, with a terrifying burst of strength, the prisoner snapped free from his restraints and lunged at the guard closest to him. The camera shook as the scene descended into chaos. The other guard screamed, backing into the corner, as the prisoner—now a monstrous creature—ripped into his colleague, tearing him apart with inhuman strength.\n\nI paused the footage, my heart pounding. The image on the screen was frozen: the creature, mid-attack, its black eyes staring soullessly into the distance as it tore into the guard's chest. The room was a bloodbath, and the transformation was complete. Whatever that thing was, it was no longer the man they had brought into the med bay.\n\nI hit play again, watching as the creature dragged the lifeless guard's body across the room, tossing it aside like a rag doll. The other guard tried to escape, fumbling with the door, but the creature was faster. It leaped at him, bringing him down in an instant. Blood splattered across the camera lens, obscuring the footage for a moment, and then… silence.\n\nThe creature stood over the bodies, breathing heavily, its chest rising and falling in sharp, unnatural movements. Black fungus covered its skin, growing thicker and darker with each passing second. It lingered there, almost motionless, and then turned slowly toward the camera. I froze. Its black, hollow eyes were locked directly on the lens as if it knew I was watching.\n\nI shut off the footage, leaning back in my chair, my breath ragged. Whatever had happened in that prison, it had started here, in the med bay. And now, it was spreading.\n\n "},"366":{"title":"Black nights of bohemia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk20q6\/black_nights_of_bohemia\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Latter_Habit408","selftext":"When a society puts forwards the freedom of each person to speak and think whatever they desire, many of them will cry in abundance, through their empty eye sockets due the bad use of technology, whole rivers of salty tears like the beaches di la mia terra gaditana. but like everything in the world, a source of wisdowm can be tricked due bad ambitions of the human beings to go through ways that doesn't seek the evolution and prosperity of the \"Being\" of man kind, but power and money. When a common person finds out these kind of conversations (which aren't frequently) they can reply with a huge variaty of things, for example: They can say that they doesn't care about it since they just want to live, or, if it's possible, became popular. For the other hand there are persons that once their minds are stimulated with these topics, a bulb will shine on top of their heads and at least they will rise their eyes and ask: \"What the hell its all of this?\". But do not forget, friend of mine, these kind of \"dystopian utopia\" (like a heaven for atheists that it's a good place to be, but it's impossible to reach) of a land which only flag its the freedom and the only lenguage spoken its the truth isn't impossible to be.... it is difficult, due how the world its nowadays, but it is not impossible.\n\n\n\nIn the scenario of you desiring to insert these information into the mind of a boy around his twenties, with a plastic and flexible mind, the combination isn't great at all since never you will never tell a boy of three years old that the most important thing in this world it's loving and caring each other (may be understandable the biblic reference) and then tell him that everyone are shit and that he could only trust in himself.\n\n\n\nThis is unfortunately the case of Gustavo, who with his twenty four springs thought he could domain the world with his words, senses and justice, but at the end... He only became the shadow of the man who sold the world.\n\n\n\nwhoever tells you that university, school or highschool it's just a parcel that represents absolutely the freedom, lies: In truth, mate, it's nothing but a jail of false doctrine and morality. Those fools that thinks that inside they will be able to get out of there more inteligents, wiser and more spiritual will find out the horrorific scene of teachers showing lies and silly stuff just to confuse and paint the truth.\n\n\n\nSo there he goes, the little bird of blue eyes as the sea and of brown hair as the wood of the trees, walking without knowing what will awaits in that parcel that supposed to be the living simbol of liberty.\n\n\n\nNo day was very especial due the monotony and it repetitive way of being and feel, but there was somehing that painted a little bit better the experience: Clubs.\n\n\n\nOf all the clubs, the club of poetry and letters called his atention because at least in there he could express himself without problems wih all the reason in the entire world. In the end... Poetry serves to express what someone feels on his insides. With this, the boy in his divine youth of 24 years signed in that club of poetry and he was well received for every single one of its components. Unlike others stories that you might heard about people drowned into destruction or ghosts\/supernatural entities that only desires to do bad things: In this one, the little poet didn't received a single bad word or look.... it would came after.\n\n\n\nUnder the protection of being able to write everything he thought and felt. he started to write down a number of various works of poetry and scriptures of philosophy with the intention of reduce the weight that he was carrying on his chest, and for his fortune and luck: His mates loved what he was doing.... Everyone but one.\n\n\n\nApparently this man was someone who at first he seemed as someone respectful and friendly with the rest of the people, but he was hiding a profile that scares the persons that knows him better due he was very radical with his opinions and thoughts. When this man saw the winds that carried the poet, he went to him to try to convince him to delete his scriptures and change his mind, because in his point of view, Gustavo was wrong in absolutely everything and that would just stain all the topics that he was touching with a bad public image.\n\n\n\nWith such request, the poet couldn't hold his laugh to that silly thing and told him that the thought and the opinion were so big that the mere try of put them together into a little subjective box was an inmense mistake. After that he asked him to not do that again because he could get himself in troubles, and then, he entered into his bedroom to keep writing his things.\n\n\n\nHuge is the surprise for everyone who has found this paper when they found out that OBVIOUSLY this.... This dictator of the mind wasn't going to let that argument of words and that mockery to his awesome figure, so he entered into his \"cave of thinking\" (it's figurative) and prepared his revenge.\n\n\n\nThat revenge of his wasn't nothing, because from one day to another, Gustavo received a number of letters with blackmails on its insides along with other things as fake eyeballs on his backpack or graffitis in his locker. With the pass of the time he didn't knew who was the person that was keeping him in that state of constant \"torment\", but then he finally found out who he was: The dictator of the mind.\n\n\n\nWith rage flowing through his veins, he went to the \"cave of thinking\" of the dictator and with anger he faced him for his little maturity for not accepting the things that he wrote that was against his ideology, but instead of taking a step backwards, the dictator faced him too by reaproching him his \"little respect\" for not accepting his doctrine and his personal opinions created by his own investigations and proofs.\n\n\n\nFor the poet's misfortune, it wouldn't be only a verbal confrontation... not at all. Once the inkwell of the night fell over the sky and the frozen eye of Yahweh started to watch he darkness of the earth, the dictator sneaked himself through the window of the poet to try to kill him with a knife to stab him in the hearth, but luckily it didn't work. The poet, tempted by the flames of passion of a man in his divine youth, sent himself to the bed of the girl's next door, so the dictator couldn't receive his ocassion to kill him that night.\n\n\n\nBut wouldn't be the end of his act. With decision, he kicked the door of the girl and threated the poet into a death match in a very poetry way, so they both could decide who's the chosen one to stay in the club of poetry. The poet didn't thought that it would be possible to happen, but before he could do anything else, the dictator jumped on him with the knife in hand. As an answer, Gustavo raised his leg to protect himself of such attack, and lately he found out how the dictator fell to the ground due such move and how the knife ended up in his throat, finally silencing him forever.\n\n\n\nThat night would get engraved by fire in the mind of the poet for the scene he would be involved and for his own conclusions about why that happened. In the end he didn't finished the career he was studying and ran away from the place for obvious reasons.\n\n\n\nBut now the real question, dear reader.... ¿Will the lightbulb of your head turn on? Look that im nothing but another mad man in the hall, but at some point i'll hit the button that will make vibrate the deepest part of your heart: School, death, freedom.... Freedom.... Why do you want to express yourselve if you don't have freedom? Make me a favor, my friend: Do not say anything. We are nothing but an auditorium of deaf ears and a public with our hands stained with blood...\n\n-Infamouskron\n\n"},"367":{"title":"The Haunting of Captain William Morgan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fk1201\/the_haunting_of_captain_william_morgan\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Dive into the chilling tale of Captain William Morgan, a ghostly figure whose mysterious disappearance still haunts the shadows of history. #GhostStories #History #Haunting #CaptainMorgan \n\n[https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@grafts80\/video\/7415947819418389806?is\\_from\\_webapp=1&amp;sender\\_device=pc&amp;web\\_id=7397566127821604382](https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@grafts80\/video\/7415947819418389806?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7397566127821604382)"},"368":{"title":"Might had been demonic.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjv2u1\/might_had_been_demonic\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BusinessRazzmatazz73","selftext":"There's a type of anger that goes beyond reason, beyond control. It's a primal thing, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path. I've only seen that kind of anger once, and it was in the eyes of my ex-girlfriend the night she tried to kill me. We'd been drinking, the four of us, lost in that easy camaraderie that comes with too much alcohol and not enough common sense. My ex was always volatile, but that night she was different. There was a brittle edge to her laughter, a challenge in her eyes that made the back of my neck prickle. Still, I didn't see it coming. None of us did. The blowout happened on the gravel road, the rear tire blowing with a loud crack that made us all jump. I cursed, already mentally calculating the cost of the repair, and that's when she snapped. Spittle landed hot on my cheek as she lunged at me, her fingers clawing for my face. I recoiled, shocked, as she shrieked obscenities that made no sense. Somehow, I managed to get out of the car, telling her to pull over before she shredded the rim. But she just floored it, the tires squealing as the car fishtailed. I barely had time to register what was happening before she was gunning for me, the headlights casting long, twisted shadows on the ground. I leapt clear by inches, my heart hammering in my chest as the car crashed into the ditch with a sickening crunch. She came at me then, her eyes wild, a rock clutched in her fist. It was like looking at a stranger. The first blow caught me on the cheekbone, a blinding flash of pain. The second hit my forehead, warm blood welling down into my eyes. I raised my arms, trying to defend myself, and that's when I saw my chance. As the rock arced down again, I swung. I wasn't aiming to knock her out, just get her off me, but my fist connected with a sickening crack and she crumpled. I left her there, groggy and moaning, as I stumbled through the dark to find a payphone. I was maybe thirty seconds gone when her scream echoed through the night – \"I'll stab your heart out!\" The words sent a chill through me and I moved faster, not looking back. When I finally got through to my mom, she told me to file a report before coming to get me. I didn't see the point, but I humored her. We were barely walking in the station when I saw my ex, her face smeared with tears and false concern, already spinning her lies to the cops. But they just looked at me, at my bloodied face and torn shirt, and they knew. They didn't believe her, thank God. But that didn't matter. What mattered was the look in her eyes as the cuffs went on, a look of pure, unadulterated hatred. I knew in that moment, I wasn't just dealing with anger. I was dealing with something much, much worse. And I knew I'd never be able to shake it off completely.\n\nTrue story"},"369":{"title":"who is SCLMBOO ?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjumjf\/who_is_sclmboo\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"chjxzkaka","selftext":"Fuckin’ hell that was creepy asf i was searching through Wikipedia about some studies for my college, but there was a blue name in the end of the page that i can click on it but, the page was literally empty then i got a notification from avast anti virus protection that says (we captured it don’t worry) then i clicked on chrome to you know close the window but all of the sudden chrome was uninstalled can anyone relate to this please?"},"370":{"title":"They don’t make them like they used to.

His hand, still bleeding from smashing the window earlier, gripped the steering wheel tightly. Every breath was shallow, every thought clouded with images of blood and death. Jessica's mutilated body haunted him, but that wasn't the worst part—it was the growing certainty that Jeff was targeting those closest to Emily. And by extension, him.\n\nThe buzzing of his phone tore him out of his trance. His eyes darted toward the screen. Another call.\n\n“Daniels,” Harris muttered, picking up the phone with a sigh.\n\n“Mark...” Daniels’s voice came through, shaky, unsteady. “It’s another body.”\n\nHarris straightened, the tension in his chest tightening like a vice. “Where?”\n\n“Parking garage. Downtown. Corner of Seventh and Hill. I’ll meet you there.”\n\nThe line clicked dead before Harris could respond. He clenched his jaw, throwing the car into drive and tearing through the rain-soaked streets. The thought of another body made his blood run cold. How many more? How many more people were tied to his past?\n\nHarris pulled up to the parking garage, its concrete structure looming against the darkened sky. Red and blue lights from police cruisers illuminated the scene as officers stood by the perimeter, cordoning off the area. The rain had let up slightly, but the air was thick with the stench of wet pavement and…something else.\n\nThe sight of John Michaels’s body made Harris’s stomach churn. He was sprawled out in the middle of the second floor, limbs twisted and pinned to the concrete with spikes in a grotesque display, Jeff’s signature smile carved into his face. The cuts were jagged, uneven, and blood still pooled around him, the smell pungent and metallic. Laying next to the man's mutilated face was his badge, along with Jeff's taunt stained in red:\n\n*Dance while the music still plays.*\n\nHarris froze for a moment, his mind racing. John. The first officer on the scene the night Emily died. He remembered the young cop standing on the doorstep of his childhood home, pale as a ghost, trying to keep the blood from staining his uniform.\n\n“He’s one of them, isn’t he?” Daniels’s voice pulled Harris from his thoughts.\n\nHarris nodded, his throat dry. “John was there the night Emily died. First officer on the scene.”\n\nDaniels cursed under his breath, running a hand through his wet hair. “Jesus, Mark. You think—”\n\n“I know,” Harris interrupted, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the bloodstained floor. “This isn’t random. Jeff’s targeting people connected to Emily.”\n\nDaniels looked at him, wide-eyed. “Why now? It’s been over a decade.”\n\nHarris had no answer. He simply stared at John’s mutilated face, the realization that Jeff was dragging him back into the past sinking deeper and deeper.\n\nBack at the office, Harris sat hunched over his desk, a mess of files and crime scene photos scattered in front of him. The pieces were starting to fall into place, but he still didn’t have the full picture.\n\nJessica Miller, her father the contractor who renovated their home after Emily’s murder. Tom Hargrove, the mechanic who had seen the confrontation between Harris and Jeff the day Emily rejected him. And now John Michaels, the first officer at the scene.\n\nBut then there was Sarah Greene. What was her connection?\n\nHis mind drifted back to Sarah’s aunt Lisa, who had been Emily’s best friend. She was there, at the birthday party, the day Jeff’s obsession had begun. That day marked the moment everything spiraled out of control. Emily’s rejection. Harris’s confrontation with Jeff. And now, Jeff was systematically erasing everyone who had been part of that day or Emily’s murder.\n\nThe phone buzzed, jarring him out of his thoughts. It was Daniels.\n\n“We got him, Mark,” Daniels said, his voice tense and hurried. “We got Jeff. He’s at the station.”\n\nHarris froze, his heart skipping a beat. “What?”\n\n“He’s at the station. We got him.”\n\nSomething about Daniels’s voice didn’t sit right. There was something off. But Harris was too focused, too desperate for it to be over. Without another word, he grabbed his jacket and bolted out of the office, speeding toward the station.\n\nThe police station was dead silent when Harris arrived. The lights flickered in the dim hallway, casting long shadows against the walls. Something was wrong. His gut twisted as he moved further into the station, his boots echoing off the tile floors.\n\nThe smell hit him first—*blood.*\n\nHis stomach lurched as he rounded the corner. Bodies. Blood everywhere. Officers were strewn across the floor, their limbs torn from their bodies, their faces unrecognizable beneath the gore. Blood splattered the walls, and the metallic scent filled Harris’s lungs, choking him.\n\nAnd then he saw him. Daniels. Barely alive, slumped against the wall, his face peeled off and pinned above him like some kind of grotesque mask. His badge was nailed to the wall next to it, gleaming under the flickering lights.\n\nHarris rushed to his side, dropping to his knees in the blood-soaked hallway. “Daniels… what the fuck happened?”\n\nDaniels’s breaths were shallow, wet with blood. He struggled to speak, his voice barely a whisper. “He… made me… call you…”\n\nHarris’s heart pounded in his chest. “Where is he?”\n\n“You know… where…” Daniels rasped, blood bubbling at his lips. “He’s… waiting for you…”\n\nDaniels’s body went limp, his final breath escaping him as the light in his eyes faded. Harris stood there, staring at the blood-soaked message scrawled above Daniels: \n\n*You know where the final act is.*\n\nHarris sped through the streets, his heart racing as he drove toward his childhood home. The pieces had all fallen into place.\n\nJessica, Tom, John, Sarah—they were all connected to that day, Emily’s birthday party. The day Jeff’s obsession had begun. The day Harris had confronted him, shoving him to the ground and telling him to stay away from Emily. That was the day Jeff decided to destroy Harris’s life.\n\nHis phone buzzed again. Harris grabbed it without thinking, expecting another taunt from Jeff. But instead, he heard a small, broken voice.\n\n“Help… please… help me…”\n\nDaniels’s daughter.\n\nHarris’s blood ran cold. In the background, he could hear Jeff’s quiet voice, almost a whisper. “It’s almost time, Mark. Don’t keep me waiting.”\n\nThe house stood in darkness as Harris approached. His heart pounded in his chest, every step heavy with dread. The front door was slightly ajar, and inside, the haunting melody of Emily’s music box drifted through the air, echoing through the house like a ghost.\n\nThe house was almost exactly how he remembered it, but something felt… wrong. Shadows danced in the corners, twisting and warping as Harris stepped inside. The air was thick, heavy with the stench of rain and something… darker.\n\nAs Harris moved through the house, memories flooded back to him. Emily’s laughter. Her smile. And then the blood. So much blood.\n\nHe reached the basement door, his hand trembling as he pushed it open. The music box’s melody grew louder as he descended the stairs, the soft clicks of its winding mechanism echoing in the silence.\n\nAnd then, Harris felt it. His foot pressed down on something—something sharp. A trap.\n\nBefore he could react, a spike shot out from the wall, tearing into his side. The pain was blinding, white-hot, and he collapsed to one knee, gasping as blood poured from the wound. He pressed a hand to his side, trying in vain to stem the flow of blood.\n\nAnd then, Jeff was there. A blur of movement, a flash of steel. Harris barely had time to react before Jeff was on him, slashing at him with a knife, each cut deep and precise. Harris stumbled back, his right arm rendered almost useless as Jeff’s blade tore through muscle.\n\n“You’ve always been too slow, Mark,” Jeff hissed, his smile gleaming in the dim light. “Too slow to save her. Too slow to stop me.”\n\nHarris’s vision blurred from the pain, but he could still make out Jeff’s face—his smile, wide and twisted, his eyes gleaming with madness.\n\nHarris tried to fire his gun, but his right arm dangled useless. The pain was overwhelming, but he couldn’t stop, not when he was so close. \n\nNot now.\n\nThe basement was a nightmare. Kimberly, Daniels’s wife, was strapped to a contraption, her mouth slowly being cranked open by a series of jagged metal spikes. Madison, Daniels’s daughter, was tied to a chair, a birthday hat perched atop her head—a sick echo of Emily’s birthday party.\n\nAnd there, standing behind Madison, grinned Jeff, slowly winding the music box Harris had given Emily for her last birthday. \n\n“It’s time to make a choice, Mark,” he taunted. “Her… or her.”\n\nKimberly’s screams filled the basement as the contraption tore into her jaw, the sound of bone cracking and flesh tearing echoing through the room. Harris’s mind raced, the pain in his side nearly blinding him, but he knew he had to act. He struggled to lift his gun, but his arm was barely responding—numb from the deep slashes Jeff had inflicted. His eyes darted between Kimberly, her eyes wide with terror as the spikes inched deeper, and Madison, shaking uncontrollably in the chair, her face pale beneath the crooked birthday hat.\n\nJeff’s grin widened, his eyes gleaming in the faint moonlight creeping through the basement window. “Tick-tock, Mark,” he whispered, his voice low and chilling. He wound the music box again, the delicate notes punctuating the grotesque scene like a ticking time bomb. \n\nHarris gritted his teeth, pushing through the pain. He had no time left. If he tried to shoot Jeff, he knew his aim would be off, and the bastard would make his move before he could even get a second shot.\n\nInch by inch, he edged closer to Madison. His mind raced—how could he save them both? But Jeff had orchestrated this moment too well, left him with no options. The soft notes emanating from Emily's music box seemed to mock him.\n\nThe contraption around Kimberly’s head clicked again, pulling her mouth wider. She screamed in agony, the sound barely human as her jaw began to split.\n\n“Tick-tock, Mark.” Jeff whispered again.\n\nHarris’s heart hammered in his chest. Madison—the terrified girl—looked at him, pleading silently with her wide, tear-filled eyes. His instincts screamed at him to protect her, to stop Jeff, but that meant making the impossible choice.\n\nJeff stood behind Madison, his knife flashing in the dim light. He taunted Harris with a grin, his fingers tracing the girl’s shoulder. “Last chance, detective. Save her… or her.”\n\nHarris’s vision blurred from the agony searing through his side, but he didn’t hesitate anymore. There was no saving them both. His fingers tightened on the revolver. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, the words catching in his throat as he aimed the gun at Kimberly's suffering body.\n\nBefore the spike could drive fully through her skull, he pulled the trigger. The gunshot cracked through the room, and Kimberly went limp, the unbearable sounds of her pain finally silenced.\n\nA second of eerie stillness filled the basement. Jeff’s wicked laugh followed, low and rumbling, as if the whole thing had been one elaborate joke. Harris’s stomach twisted with disgust and rage. He had fallen right into Jeff’s trap.\n\nBut as Jeff took a step toward him, Harris used that moment of distraction. With a grunt of sheer determination, Harris shoved Madison to the floor, knocking the chair sideways. Jeff moved fast, but Harris was faster—he pressed the barrel of his gun against Jeff’s chest and fired point-blank.\n\nThe impact sent Jeff stumbling back, his smile faltering for a moment. But the monster recovered quickly, his knife flashing toward Harris in a flurry of strikes. Pain exploded across Harris’s right side as Jeff slashed him again and again, deep, rapid cuts leaving Harris reeling. His gun clicked empty.\n\nHarris dropped to his knees, the world spinning around him. Blood poured from his wounds, his body trembling as he fought to remain conscious. Jeff’s face loomed over him, his twisted grin the last thing Harris saw before everything went dark.\n\nHe woke to the sound of Madison screaming. His vision swam as he blinked through the haze of pain, struggling to push himself up. The music box was still playing, its haunting melody filling the room. Jeff was gone, his knife left embedded deep in Harris’s side, and the blood from his wounds felt warm as it soaked through his shirt. Every muscle screamed in agony, but he forced himself to move.\n\nMadison was thrashing in her chair, her terrified sobs filling the basement. Harris staggered over, each step a struggle as the pain in his side threatened to take him down. His hands trembled as he pulled the knife from his flesh with a sickening squelch, using it to slice through the ropes binding Madison to the chair.\n\nThe girl collapsed into his arms, her small body trembling against him as she clung to him with desperate strength. Harris barely had the strength to hold her, but he did, shielding her from the horrific scene around them.\n\n“It’s okay… it’s over,” he whispered, though he wasn’t sure if he believed his own words. Madison didn’t respond, her sobs the only sound that echoed through the darkened room.\n\nTogether, they stumbled toward the stairs, Harris’s legs barely able to support their combined weight. His entire body was shaking with the effort, but he had to get them out. He couldn’t let Jeff finish what he’d started.\n\nThe music box’s haunting melody followed them up the stairs, growing fainter the closer they got to the door. Harris kicked the basement door open, the cold night air rushing in and offering a small respite from the suffocating dread that filled the house.\n\nThey made it to the front porch, Harris collapsing onto the wooden steps with Madison still clutching him. His hands fumbled for his phone, his fingers slick with blood as he dialed 911. He could barely focus on the words as he gave the address—his childhood home. A place where the nightmare had started all those years ago.\n\nHarris watched the lights of the approaching police cars in the distance, the wailing sirens growing louder. Relief should have come, but all he felt was a cold emptiness. This wasn’t over. He knew it. And deep down, he knew Jeff wasn’t gone.\n\nAs the first flashing lights became visible, Harris heard a familiar sound—the soft, eerie melody of Emily’s music box, still playing from inside the house. His blood ran cold as he looked back at the door, the chilling sound creeping through the air like a final, taunting reminder.\n\nThen his phone buzzed in his hand. Harris glanced down at the screen, his heart skipping a beat. The caller ID read:\n\n*Daniels.*\n\n"},"374":{"title":"Wait is that Ball bouncing... vigorously","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjr65x\/wait_is_that_ball_bouncing_vigorously\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"stunnaboynum1gogetem","selftext":"This all goes back to when I was just 9 years old I loved Lebran but ever since that day I've been too traumatized to even look his direction.

Billy Crowe was a latchkey kid, often picked on in school and mercilessly abused at home. His father drank away the family’s misery, leaving scars etched deeper than the ones on his skin. It wasn’t until he stumbled upon the dark arts, flipping through an old book in the dusty corner of a decrepit library, that everything changed.\n\nHe dedicated his late-night escapades to mastering the sinister rituals that promised retribution on those who wronged him. But desperation and despair replaced innocence, and one fateful night, a terrible plan was set in motion. Lured by the lies of power, he drank deeply from the well of vengeance, unknowingly sealing his own fate.\n\nThe night he was murdered seemed like any other in Briar Hollow. Toro, the town bully, and his friends had discovered Billy lurking behind an old oak tree, desperately clutching his tattered book of secrets. They encircled him, their laughter dark and cruel. It didn’t take long before they turned a cheap thrill into a bloodbath, beating him—punches raining like hard, pity-less raindrops.\n\nBilly felt his heart stop, suffocated by pain and betrayal. Darkness swam around him, stretching out his final moments as a heavy weight crashed onto his chest. “Let the darkness take you,” Toro jeered, as the world faded to black.\n\nBut death, it turned out, was only a threshold.\n\nDays later, a thick fog rolled into Briar Hollow, dense and choking. Whispers of an ominous presence prowled the streets, echoing through the alleys. On the tenth night, the air turned electrified, crawling with an uneasy energy. Billy arose from his grave—a puppet of malevolence woven together with strands of wrath and agony. His eyes were hollow, reflecting nothing but an insatiable hunger for revenge.\n\nAs he staggered from the loamy earth, shadows clung to his form, each step resonating with the echo of pain he endured. His hands were transformed into lethal instruments of vengeance. He stalked the streets, a wraith cloaked in darkness, disconnected from the sensation of being alive.\n\nOne by one, the inhabitants of Briar Hollow began to disappear. Their screams ricocheted off the walls, sending the townsfolk into a frenzy. Houses were locked tighter than vaults, but he was patient, a predator relishing the game.\n\nThe first victim was Toro’s best friend, Jake—a jock who reveled in his own cruelty. Just as dawn broke, Jake’s lifeless body was discovered in the school gymnasium, eyes wide open, a mocking smile carved grotesquely into his face. A twisted message was scrawled on the wall in red: “I’m here to stay.”\n\nRumors spread like wildfire; the town’s grip on sanity twisted and cracked as one by one, Billy’s former tormentors succumbed to his wrath. Each death was more horrific than the last, a gruesome spectacle that left the remaining bullies trembling in fear. When he found Toro, he presented a new form of hell—binding him to the very tree where the beating occurred. With an unholy laugh, Billy peeled away the skin from Toro’s face, layering it over his own like a morbid mask, each turn of the knife punctuated by the boy's howls of agony.\n\nThen came the others—those who had shared in his torment—hunted and dispatched in a flurry of relentless vengeance. A girl named Lisa, who once hurled a bottle at him in gym class, met her end in the woods, her screams muffled by the ragged landscape. When he killed her, he wore the shirt he had been mocked for, blackened and torn, rendering her terrified expression a mirror of despair.\n\nBut it was his parents he saved for last. They would pay dearly for the suffering, the neglect, and the beatings—for reducing him to a mere shadow of a child. When the final night came, the house was alive with tension as his parents heard the creaking floorboards echo just down the corridor, a sound they hoped to forget.\n\nBilly entered their home, drenched in darkness more potent than ever before. The look of recognition and horror on their faces as they realized the monster they had created sent shivers down the spine of the universe. As each scream consumed the silence, Billy reminded them of the pain they had inflicted, giving them a front-row seat to their sins.\n\nTheir horror culminated as he crafted a reality so twisted it felt like waking from a nightmare into another. They became shadows of their former selves, trapped and tormented in their own home, while he reveled in their fear, delivering imaginations so grotesque they could hardly perceive them—barbed wire, animals turned on their own, and the echoes of his own laughter filled their ears.\n\nAs dawn broke over Briar Hollow for the final time, it did so on a landscape marred by chaos, shadows stretching across the land—no sign of a boy who once knew innocence.\n\nBilly Crowe had become more than a victim; he had become the embodiment of vengeance, a creature of darkness that no longer felt pain, only rage. Those who had wronged him would never find peace, for he was both judge and executioner—an echo of torment that would linger long after the last scream faded into the morning light.\n\nAnd as for the town? It became a hushed whisper—a chilling tale told around campfires, a testament to the horrors that once lived under the surface, waiting to rise again."},"376":{"title":"Music","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjjwy0\/music\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"g00bette","selftext":"I'm currently trying to make a spotify playlist filled with creepy pasta songs.

It felt like I'd had the worst nightmare of my life but I couldn't remember any of it. Despite this I still felt extremely scared and anxious. As I began to wake up more I noticed it felt like I was being dragged. Thinking I was being dragged out of bed I tried to kick at whoever was pulling me. But my legs wouldn't move. I soon realized neither would the rest of my body except my eyes. I closed my eyes and tried to force myself back to sleep, but it only woke me up more. It didn't help it felt like I was being dragged through what felt like thick, wet mud. When I finally opened my eyes they started to burn causing me to wince from the pain. I struggled to open them again as my eyelids fought against me to stay closed. As I kept trying to open my eyes I started to wonder where I was being taken. When my eyes stopped burning and adjusted to the bright, yet somehow dim lights, I stopped breathing. I was being dragged through a hospital corridor, but the walls and ceiling were covered in a thick black substance that covered everything like pith on a fresh peeled orange. I strained my eyes to get a look at who was dragging me, but could only see the top of their black curly hair. I shut my eyes and tried to calm myself down, telling myself it was nothing more than a sleep paralysis nightmare. This wasn't anything new, it was just more fucked up than I was used to. I could feel tears pushing past my eyes and rush down my cheeks as I started to believe myself less and less. When I opened my eyes again I was face to face with someone. He was bent over and looking directly into my eyes. He looked like any other person but his eyes disturbed me. One was an ocean of pure white that seemed to swirl like a cloud. His iris was an inky black slit that resembled a bottomless ravine. The other eye so black the glowing white slit looked like a pure white cloud floating in the middle of his eyesocket. Looking into his eyes made me uncomfortably aware of my mortality, and left no doubt in my mind that he ragarded my life with the concern someone would have for dirt under their feet. I strained my eyes to look in front of me again and they teared up to the point my vision was blurred. The curly haired person was no longer in front of me even though I was still moving. I tried to rationalize it but couldn't come up with anything. I was so lost in thought and self pity that I didn't notice my eyes were bulging out until I felt the pain. As the pain grew I noticed it felt more like they were being slowly pulled out. My nerves and blood veins were desperately trying to stay intact as my vision began to warp. I could feel the air caressing them as they were pulled farther away from my face causing me to feel an overwhelming sense of disgust and discomfort. The nerves and blood veins tore until they came free with a \"pop\" and I felt the severed tails slide out of my eyesockets. The pain caused an awful symphony of cries and screams erupted from my mouth and echoed through the corridor. But as soon as I'd started my jaw was slammed shut, my teeth cleanly severing my tongue. My eye sockets and mouth overflowed with blood as I began drowning in it. Seconds turned to minutes as I started to wonder when I'd die, and as more time passed I started to wonder why I hadn't died yet. My feet suddenly dropped to the floor with a loud, wet smack. Immediately after I felt something pull my head, dragging my body up until I could feel him breathing on my face. The blood in my mouth and eyesockets poured down my face like waterfalls. I couldn't comprehend what was happening to me, I couldn't even think of why I deserved any of this. Unable to give myself a logical answer I drowned in my anxiety and became lost in panic. I suddenly started getting chills and undescribable abdominal pain as I felt something crushing my muscles and organs. I felt as my lungs and heart popped, and then my stomach and other organs. My stomach acid spread like chrapnel burning through the mush that had been the inside of my body. It burned as I felt my insides get pulled up towards my mouth, widening my thought as it came out. I could feel the unsettling texture of my blood, organs, and flesh as it slid out my throat. It made me violently nauseous causing more pain. I could hear it piling on the floor and I prayed that when it was done I'd finally die. I waited, content that the pain would finally stop. I tried to wait for death with dignity but again it seemed that it had no intention of freeing me. I started to panic again as minutes became an hour when the last of my insides came out hitting the floor. Air rushed into my gaped throat as I immediately realized I couldn't breathe anymore. I felt hollowed out like a Jack O Lantern, and my skin felt like an empty sack. My head was released and I fell in the pile that'd been left. I lied there hoping it would think I was dead. But I couldn't even explain why I wasn't dead so I already knew it wouldn't be that easy. For awhile all I could hear was a low hum, but I was still paranoid that it never left. In my head I begged it to just leave me alone. As I waited I swore I heard a faint laugh, it didn't seem like it came from whatever had been dragging me. While I tried to determine if I really heard anything I noticed I wasn't in pain anymore, and I couldn't feel my head resting on my guts. I felt more and more detached like I was floating deeper into a void. For the first time I felt safe, and though I couldn't explain it I didn't want to leave.

In the attic, I stumbled upon an old wooden chest buried under dusty boxes. Inside were a folded American flag, some medals, and a journal—all in perfect condition, almost untouched by time. Here’s the strange part: my mother always said my great-grandfather and his squad-mates were never found after an assignment, so I assumed they were MIA in combat. But after reading his journal, I realized that wasn’t the case at all.\n\n \n\n**August 28, 1899**\n\nIt’s been a few weeks since I last heard the sweet voice of my Ruby, and oh, how I miss her.\n\nMy thoughts often drift to her swollen belly, our unborn child, and the plans we made for after this mission. Louisiana was supposed to be our new home once I returned—war or no war, I promised her that much. Yet here I am, in this forsaken ruin, the Spanish Fort, which should’ve long been left to rot.\n\nThey say it’s strategic, but I’ve yet to see any sense in that. We ain’t seen hide nor hair of an enemy. Sergeant Harris got the orders, though he seems just as puzzled as the rest of us. He’s a solid man, Harris, but there’s a look in his eye I don’t care for. Maybe it’s just the quiet here—too much of it.\n\nThe air feels... wrong, heavy, like it’s watching us.\n\nOrders were simple: *report any anomalous activity*.\n\nWhat that means, none of us rightly know. But I can’t help but think we’re here for something more than they’re telling us.\n\n**September 1, 1899**\n\nFort’s falling apart at the seams.\n\nWall’s crumbling, place is a damned wreck.\n\nWe’ve been patrolling day and night, but it’s dead as a graveyard. Richards keeps griping about how this whole thing’s a waste of time, and maybe he’s right. Still, Hunter takes it all too serious-like, creeping around every corner as if an army’s about to pop out of the shadows.\n\nBut it’s Jameson that’s got me worried. He’s been here longer than any of us, but the man’s been spooked ever since we arrived. Pale, eyes hollowed out, muttering about “the voices.” I asked him what he meant by that, but all he did was look at me like I’d find out soon enough.\n\nAin’t no comfort in that, I can tell you.\n\n**September 5, 1899**\n\nIt was late last night when things took a turn.\n\nHunter and I were on watch when we heard it—soft, like someone whispering from a distance. It didn’t make sense. The fort’s been empty for years, but there it was. We scoured the perimeter, found nothing, just that voice slipping away like smoke.\n\nWhen we told Harris, he brushed us off, tried to act like it was nothing. But I saw his hands shake, just for a second. Something’s not right here.\n\nJameson gave me that same look again—like he’s known this all along.\n\n**September 8, 1899**\n\nJameson finally cracked, pulled me aside last night after everyone else had turned in.\n\nHe’s been hearing things since the day he set foot here, he says. Voices, whispers, just like the ones Hunter and I heard. I told him it was just the wind, but he swore up and down it wasn’t.\n\n“It’s them,” he said.\n\nWhat he meant by that, he wouldn’t say. Left me with a knot in my gut that ain’t gone away since.\n\n**September 12, 1899**\n\nSergeant Harris broke his silence today.\n\nTurns out, we ain’t the first ones to be stationed at this godforsaken fort. There were others before us, sent here for some ‘observation missions.’ Most of ’em never made it back. Disappeared, or left their posts, according to Harris.\n\nHe was told to keep quiet about it, but with all that’s been happening, he couldn’t hold it in no more. He said this place has got a reputation, that people say it’s haunted. Haunted or not, something’s definitely wrong.\n\nThe whispers... they’re getting louder.\n\n**September 15, 1899**\n\nJameson found a chamber.\n\nGod knows how he came across it, but it’s been buried under rubble for who knows how long. He took me there just before dawn. Inside, we found old uniforms, rusted weapons, and bones. More bones than I care to think about.\n\nJameson stood there, white as a sheet.\n\n“This is where they are,” he whispered.\n\n“They never left.”\n\nI wanted to run, hell, I *should’ve* run, but Jameson wouldn’t budge. Says the fort’s cursed, that what happened to those soldiers is happening to us.\n\n**September 18, 1899**\n\nJameson’s gone.\n\nJust like that.\n\nOne minute he was here, the next—nothing. We searched every inch of the fort, but there’s no sign of him. Only thing left was his jacket near that chamber. Richards is close to losing his mind, keeps saying we need to leave before it’s too late.\n\nHarris, though—he’s sticking to orders like a drowning man clinging to driftwood. The whispers... they’re following us now.\n\nSometimes I think I hear Jameson’s voice among them, calling out from the dark.\n\n**September 22, 1899**\n\nI don’t know how much longer I can do this.\n\nThe fort feels alive, like it’s breathing down our necks, watching every move we make. Harris is falling apart, trying to keep us in line, but it’s no use. Hunter won’t speak anymore, and Richards... well, Richards isn’t far behind him.\n\nThe voices—they ain’t just in the air anymore. They’re in our heads, calling us by name.\n\nHow long before they call me too?\n\n**September 24, 1899**\n\nFound another door today, hidden in the old barracks. Behind it were more bones, and an inscription on the wall:\n\n*We are the forgotten. Do not seek us.*\n\nIt felt like a warning, like it was meant for us, though we ignored it.\n\nHunter’s convinced we ain’t supposed to be here, and I’m starting to think he’s right. But it’s too late for second thoughts now.\n\n**September 26, 1899**\n\nRichards is gone.\n\nLeft in the middle of the night, no note, no nothing.\n\nAll we found were his tracks leading off into the woods. Harris sent us to search, but it was a waste of time. Hunter’s barely holding it together. Keeps muttering that we’re being hunted, and I’m starting to think he’s right.\n\nThe whispers—they’re louder now, clearer. Sometimes I hear footsteps too, but when I look, there’s no one there.\n\n**September 28, 1899**\n\nThree of us left.\n\nHarris, Hunter, and me.\n\nWe don’t talk about the others, not anymore. Last night, we heard something moving in the fort, heavy steps echoing through the walls. Harris went to check, but he came back shaking like a leaf. He won’t say what he saw, but whatever it was, it’s only a matter of time now.\n\nHunter ain’t slept in days. He says we were sent here to contain something, something dark, and I’m starting to believe him.\n\n**September 30, 1899**\n\nIt’s happening.\n\nHarris is holding on by a thread, clinging to duty like it’s all he’s got. But there ain’t no mission left, not really. Just survival. Hunter won’t leave the gatehouse, says something’s coming for us, the same thing that took Jameson, Richards, and God knows who else.\n\nThe whispers—they’re so loud now, it’s like they’re right beside us. Harris keeps talking about orders, about relief coming, but I don’t think anyone’s coming for us.\n\nI think we were sent here to be forgotten.\n\n**October 3, 1899**\n\nI’m the last one now.\n\nHarris, Hunter…\n\nThey’re gone.\n\nVanished like the others. The whispers—they won’t stop. They’re calling my name, telling me it’s time. I hear Jameson’s voice in the dark, telling me to come to the chamber.\n\nI don’t know how much longer I can hold out. Whatever’s here, it’s been waiting for us all along, and now it’s calling me home.\n\nMay God be with me.\n\n**October 5, 1899**\n\nAfter months in this sweltering heat, these islands don’t seem so bad anymore. The lads are in good spirits, joking around like old times.\n\nHarris has been keeping us steady as always, barking orders but with a grin.\n\nRichards keeps talking about heading back to New York after this, says he misses the noise of the city and the hustle of Manhattan. He’s had his fill of the Philippines, says he can’t stand the heat, the mosquitoes, or the dampness that clings to everything.\n\nHunter’s been quieter, but that’s always been his way—watchful, thinking things through. Keeps his thoughts close.\n\nJameson...\n\nWell, Jameson’s been restless. He keeps saying we’ve got more work to do here, that the insurgents are still hiding out in the hills, waiting for us to drop our guard.\n\nBut I reckon we’re nearly done here.\n\n**October 7, 1899**\n\nI got a letter from Ruby. Our daughter’s here now, a little baby girl, can you believe it?\n\nShe gave birth last week, and I’m already picturing her in my arms. I’ll be holding her soon enough. They’ve named her Myra, after my mother. Sweet thing, I can almost hear her little cries.\n\nRuby says she’s the spitting image of me—poor girl, she’ll have to grow into the nose, I suppose. I can’t wait to meet her, to see the way she looks at me when I walk through that door in Louisiana.\n\nWe’ll be a family.\n\nA real family.\n\n**October 10, 1899**\n\nYou know, it’s strange, but I had this dream last night.\n\nMyra, all grown up, wearing a white dress, a veil over her face. She was getting married, standing at the altar, and I could hardly believe it—how fast the time had gone. Harris and Richards were there, laughing, patting me on the back, saying, *“Can you believe it? She’s all grown up!”*\n\nIt felt so real. And when I saw her, my little girl all grown, I wept like a fool. I think she even kissed me on the cheek before walking down the aisle, telling me, *“I love you, Pawpaw.”*\n\nIsn’t that something?\n\n**April 13, 1979**\n\nThank the good Lord it’s Friday! The boys are coming over for a few beers!\n\nWould you look at that—I can’t believe I still have this log book after all these years. Been sitting in the dresser all this time, just waiting for me to remember it. Funny how life sneaks up on you like that. Myra’s all grown now, married, and with a baby on the way. I reckon Melinda’s a fine name for a girl, but at my age, what do I know? Hard to wrap my head around the thought of being a grandfather soon.\n\nRetirement, well, it doesn’t much suit a man like me, but I suppose I’m finally ready to hang up my hat. Ruby’s been after me to tidy up my old service things—calls it sentimental value, and I guess she’s right.\n\nJust got to track down the rest of my decorations now.\n\n \n\nThat was the last entry.\n\nI’m not sure what to make of it. According to my mother, my great-grandfather never made it back home. She said she never got to meet him. The strange part is, they were stationed at Spanish Fort, right here in New Orleans, Louisiana. But in his last journal entries, he wrote as if they were in Southeast Asia, during the Philippine-American War in 1899. Was he confused? Did he enter the chamber? How did the journal even make it back to my family? I have so many questions, but no one left to answer them now that my grandmother has passed.\n\nStill, the journal revealed much about the man he was—a loving husband, a good father, and a true friend. I only wish I could tell him “He’s never forgotten.” But I find comfort knowing he’s happy, wherever he is.\n\n[CreepyWeirdStuff](https:\/\/youtu.be\/l04ER7EqLiQ?si=KbNq1svAG2TZDwrb)"},"379":{"title":"making a creepypasta vid basically reading some popular ones is it ok??","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjfgwv\/making_a_creepypasta_vid_basically_reading_some\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Extension-Cod8041","selftext":"BASICALLY. im a very very unpopular youtuber i have 97 subscribers but for halloween i wanted to make a silly \"reading nostalgic creepypasta video!!!\" however im scared to be disrespecting the authors of it?? obvioulsy the video will not be making me any money whatsoever, but i just want to be safe. so i just wanna know if its alright to post a vid of just reading\/commentary of some creepypastas with credit in the description??"},"380":{"title":"It came from the trees (Part Two)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjg9fw\/it_came_from_the_trees_part_two\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"WaluigiStan","selftext":"\nOne week, that’s all it had been. \nMoving out of my childhood home was meant to be a breath of fresh air.

It was all in my head.\n\n(“Audrey, come with us, Audrey.”)\n\n“Everything seems fine, Ms. ———, maybe try to get some sleep and see if you feel better.”\n\nSleep. Sleep sleep sleep sleep. It’s just a nightmare. I was stressed from work and the anticipation of moving. My mind was playing tricks on me. But it was not. It was not a nightmare. \n\nI dreamt of it again that same night. \n\n(“Audrey, you are not alone, Audrey.”)\n\n(“Audrey, we won’t hurt you, Audrey.”)\n\nIn my dream, it took away the light until all I could see was its eyes. \nWhen I woke up, all the nightlights were gone. All the bulbs in the lamps were gone. \nI remember screaming hysterically. Telling my neighbors to leave me alone because I wasn’t sure if it was actually them. \nI remember the sweet ladies voice. \n\n“Are you okay Ms. ———? We heard you screaming, do you need help? Should I call the authorities? Ms. ———?”\n\nAfter this I installed cameras. In every room. In front of my door. Next to my bed. \nI started to take a sleeping aid. \nIt did not help. \n\nI wanted my parents. \nI wanted to go home.\n\nGo home. \n\nI could not remember what my home looked like. \n\nI avoided everyone.

The voices would be mixed together to form broken sentences. \n\n(“Audrey, take our hands into your own.”)\n\nI was falling to pieces. I started to cover my mirrors. Even in the daylight I could see it. \nIt would reach for me with its broken limbs and horrid smile. Since I had first seen it, it had become so human-like. \nTrying to copy something that might comfort me. Something to convince me to trust it. \n\nBut still wrong. \n\nIt’s arms still had too many bends and twists. \nIts face was never fully visible. \nWhite eyes.

Para empezar, estaba abandonada desde que alguien podía recordar, y nadie en el pequeño pueblo de villarosario hablaba de ella, excepto en murmullos. \n\nPara aquellos que pasaban frente a ella, un frío extraño les recorría la espalda, y nunca, ni por accidente, miraban hacia sus ventanas.\n\n Esos cristales empañados y rotos parecían seguirte, y el jardín, con sus árboles ya sin hojas y malas hierbas enredadas, emanaba un olor a cementerio que ni siquiera el viento lograba desvanecer\n \nLa casa pertenecía a la familia bayona, o eso decían las historias. Alguna vez, fue la más hermosa de la región, llena de vida y risas. Pero esa familia se fue apagando como una debil vela en la oscuridad. \n\nEl último de los bayona, un hombre llamado jacob, fue encontrado muerto en su dormitorio hace 21 años. \n\nNadie quiso entrar a investigar demasiado. Después de todo, todos sabían que no había sido un simple ataque al corazón el verdugo de su existencia.\n\nAlex Alvarez no era del pueblo. Había llegado hace seis meses, huyendo de una vida en la ciudad que se le había vuelto insostenible. A sus 36 años, buscaba una vida tranquila, alejado de la vida costosa de la ciudad . \n\nLa estancia en villarosario le parecía ideal: un pueblo donde todo es tranquilo y donde la rutina es la misma desde años atras. A menudo, mientras caminaba por el sendero cerca de la laguna, sus pensamientos lo llevaban al límite de la propiedad de los bayona.\n\n Al principio, Alex evitaba la casa como todos los demás. Algo en su cabeza le decía que debía mantenerse alejado, Pero la curiosidad, ese impulso que a veces conduce a la gente a comportarse de manera imprudente, comenzó a abrirse paso en su mente.\n \nUna tarde de octubre, cuando las sombras eran largas y el aire olía a hojas quemadas, Alex decidió dar un paso que cambiaría su vida. Se detuvo frente a la casa y la miró detenidamente por primera vez. \n\nNo era muy distinta de otras casas viejas y deshabitadas que había visto, pero algo en la manera en que la luz del crepúsculo iluminaba la fachada lo inquietaba profundamente.\n\n Quizás era la forma en que las sombras parecían aferrarse a las paredes, o cómo las ventanas reflejaban en su interior una desconocida y siniestra dimensión macabra. Y entonces, como si una fuerza invisible lo empujara, Alex se encontró caminando por el sendero de grava, tierra y flores marchitas hacia la puerta principal.\n \nLa puerta, pesada y hecha de madera oscura, se abrió con un crujido largo como si fueran gritos de lamentos. Dentro, el aire estaba viciado, cargado con el olor de la humedad y el polvo, pero también con algo más. Algo indefinible que lo hizo contener la respiración.\n\n La sala estaba llena de muebles viejos cubiertos de sábanas amarillentas por el tiempo. Las escaleras que conducían al segundo piso estaban intactas, pero Alex sintió un rechazo a subir.\n \n En lugar de eso, se dirigió ala cocina, donde las cortinas colgaban pesadamente, bloqueando casi toda la luz. Mientras sus ojos se acostumbraban a la penumbra, notó algo extraño: una silla, arrinconada, sin cubrir y aparentemente utilizada recientemente. \n \nSe acercó, su corazón latiendo más rápido. Sobre la mesa frente a la silla había una hoja de papel, amarillenta y quebradiza, como si hubiera estado allí durante décadas, pero con una tinta fresca que decía: \"Bienvenido de nuevo, Jacob. Te estaba esperando\"\n\nAlex sintió un escalofrío por todo su cuerpo. Dio un paso atrás, pero algo lo detuvo. La casa, con su atmósfera sofocante y su silencio aterrador, parecía esperar algo de él. De repente, un fuerte ruido de pasos resonó por el pasillo, como si alguien bajara las escaleras pesadamente.\n\n El sonido hizo eco en la casa vacía, y Alex se quedó paralizado su mente se bloqueó por completo. No podía moverse, ni siquiera gritar. Una figura apareció en la entrada del salón, apenas visible en la penumbra.\n \nEra un hombre, alto y delgado, con una cara pálida y hundida, como si hubiera estado enfermo durante mucho tiempo. Llevaba ropa antigua, como si hubiera salido de otra época. Pero lo más aterrador de todo eran sus ojos, o más bien, la ausencia de ellos. \n\nEn su lugar, había dos huecos negros que parecían absorber la poca luz de la habitación. Alex intentó retroceder, pero sus pies parecían ser sujetados fuertemente por manos saliendo del suelo, como si la casa misma lo estuviera atrapando.\n\n El hombre comenzó a avanzar lentamente hacia él, y con cada paso, el aire se volvía más pesado, más denso. Alex comenzó a respirar de manera agitada como si el oxígeno se le escapara .\n \n\"Jacob\", susurró la figura con una voz que parecía surgir de lo más profundo del infierno. \"Finalmente has vuelto.\"  \"No... no soy Jacob\", tartamudeo Alex, tratando de recuperar el control de su cuerpo.\n\n Pero la figura no se detuvo. Extendió una mano, cadavérica, hacia él. En ese momento, Alex sintió una punzada de dolor en el pecho, un dolor que se extendió rápidamente por todo su cuerpo. Era como si alguien hubiera desgarrarado su pecho y estuviera apretando su corazón con fuerza.\n \nCon un último esfuerzo, Alex logró dar un paso hacia atrás, pero sus pies se enredaron y cayó al suelo. El impacto lo hizo perder la visión por un segundo, y cuando abrió los ojos, el hombre había desaparecido. \n\nLa casa estaba nuevamente en silencio, pero el dolor en su pecho persistía. Alex, jadeando, se levantó tambaleándose y corrió hacia la puerta de entrada, sintiendo que algo oscuro y malvado lo seguía de cerca. Cuando finalmente salió de la casa, la luz de la luna lo golpeó como un balde de agua fría. \n\nCorrió sin mirar atrás, y no se detuvo hasta que llegó a su casa al otro lado del pueblo. Cerró todas las puertas y ventanas, encendió todas las luces y se sentó en una esquina, a temblar y llorar.\n\nEsa noche, Alex no pudo dormir. Cada vez que intentaba hacerlo, veía al hombre sin ojos, avanzando lentamente hacia él, llamándolo Jacob. Pero lo peor vino al amanecer, cuando notó una mancha oscura en su piel, justo sobre su corazón. Era una marca, un hematoma, en forma de mano.\nUna mano cadavérica. \n\nDespués de ese día Alex se sintió diferente. Había algo en él que había cambiado. Sus pensamientos se volvían oscuros, y en las noches más frías, escuchaba pasos fuera de su puerta. \n\nLos vecinos empezaron a darse cuenta de que algo no estaba bien con él. Ya no saludaba ni sonreía, y cada vez que alguien le preguntaba si le ocurría algo o si estaba bien de salud, él simplemente respondía que no era nada y se despedía apresuradamente.\n\nUn  mes después, los vecinos hicieron un macabro descubrimiento. Alex yacía muerto en la cocina, sentado en una silla. Su cuerpo rígido y sin vida estaba inclinado hacia adelante, con la cabeza golpeando contra la mesa, como si en sus últimos momentos hubiera intentado desesperadamente levantarse, pero algo oscuro y siniestro lo hubiera retenido.  El aire dentro de la pequeña morada parecía más denso, como si hubiera absorbido los gritos de agonía de los condenados. Su corazón, se había detenido inexplicablemente. Pero no fue la muerte lo que atormentó a quienes lo encontraron; fue su rostro.\n\nEn la penumbra, la expresión de Alex era un grito silencioso. Sus ojos ahora eran dos pozos de desesperación. sus labios estaban estirados en una mueca de horror. Nadie sabe Qué había visto en sus últimos momentos, o Qué abismo había contemplado más allá de la realidad\n\nLa gente comenzó a especular pero nadie tenía pruebas concretas, Sin embargo, una cosa era segura: la marca en el pecho de Alex, en forma de mano cadavérica, era una huella siniestra, como si los dedos de algo más allá de este mundo hubieran perforado su carne y arrebatado su alma. era la prueba de que había sido llamado de vuelta a la casa que está, Al Final Del Camino"},"382":{"title":"I seem to keep delivering pizzas to my empty flat ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fj2b4s\/i_seem_to_keep_delivering_pizzas_to_my_empty_flat\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I found a pizza delivery job just 10 minutes from my flat.

Now I need you stress that I live alone and ever since I started working at a delivery pizza takeaway store, the only place I ever seem to deliver to is to my own flat? That sounds absurd because I live alone and if I am work, then how can deliveries come from my flat? \n\nIt's true and I remember the first I got a delivery order from my own flat. I had to deliver it and I was calm. I knocked on my flat and some weed smoking hippy opened the door and took the pizza and gave me a great tip. My flat looked different inside and had a load of hippies inside. I then drove back to the pizza delivery place and I got another pizza delivery from my flat again. I was knocked out of the park by these deliveries all coming from my flat. I delivered another pizza again to my flat on the same day, this time an obese lonely man opened the door. \n\nThe flat looked completely different and it smelled horrible. The hygiene of the place was  putrid and I gave the pizza to the obese guy and he tipped me as well. All night long I was delivering pizzas to my own flat. Then when I went home to my flat, it was completely empty and it was back to being my flat. It was incredible what I had just experienced and I had no idea who those people were. At least I got paid and tipped all at the same time and I didn't have to deliver far, as all of my deliveries were to my flat. \n\nEver since working at the pizza place 2 years ago I have just been delivering to my own flat. I see all sorts of people opening the door and my flat inside looks completely different. I have delivered pizza to my flat where murderers had opened the door and there was blood all over the walls. I have even delivered pizzas to my flat and non human figures had opened the door from inside the flat. \n\nThen I come home and it is exactly the same as I had prepared it. Then one day I get another pizza order to my flat like usual, when I get to the front door of the flat, the person who opens it, is myself.

I had stepped out and turned on my phone light. \n\nI should’ve stayed in my car. \nIt wasn’t a deer. \n\nIt was large and looked like its limbs were broken. I couldn’t see its head, only its backside. It almost looked like a dog and I remember feeling horrible, thinking I’d hit someone’s livestock guard. \nIts breathing was wet and raspy. \nAs I stepped closer it jerked and shuddered, a sick cracking sound filling the air as its limbs twisted and moved. \n\nI still feel dread thinking of its face. \nToo dark to see anything but its eyes. And teeth. \nA limb with too many joints had extended to me. The sound was nauseating.\n\n(“…..A…Aud-drey…”)\n\nIt choked the word out. \nMy name. \n\nI ran to my car and sped off.

Was its voice. \nIt used the voices of people I know. \n\nMy family. \nMy friends. \nMy coworkers.\n\n(“Audrey, we are here Audrey.”)\n\nEven when I was awake I could hear it calling to me. \nWhispering to me at my work desk. \nHumming to me in my car. \nTalking to me like an old friend, but much more unsettling.\n\n(“Audrey, come to us, Audrey.”) \n\nI moved from my home one week ago. \nI thought a change of environment would put an end to the nightmares and paranoia.\n\nI was wrong. \nIt only got worse. \nI am not alone. \nAnd I don’t know what it is they want from me.

At 5 years old, a child should be wondering about space or dinosaurs or Bluey. But me? I was wondering where I was and what happened to my parents. Did they not want me? That was the question I always asked myself. Every morning that I didn’t wake up to my parents and every night that I went to sleep without a goodnight from them. Being that young, you can start to do things yourself, have sort of a control over certain situations…but there was no control over this. All I remember from that day in November was waking up outside the orphanage with my mother carrying me to the door crying. I remember thinking she was taking me to a playdate with one of my friends and I got excited. An older man answered the door and slowly took me out of my mother’s hands. I remember saying, “Bye mommy, see you later! I love you!” but she must not have heard me because she just kept walking away. \n\nAs I grew older and technology started becoming a little more advanced, I always begged my guardian to go to the library so I could read and get on the computers. I would spend most of my free time there playing Club Penguin and reading fantasy novels. My favorites were ones where the Hero went through such hardships and torment that it almost seemed impossible for a happy ending. But it always happened, always. \n\n“That’s going to be me one day.” I said every time I finished the last chapter of any one of those books. For someone my age at the time to go through that and still have optimism about life is nothing short of a miracle. My guardian was always nice to me and always listened to what I had to say. She would let me cry, laugh, speak, and share my secrets and dreams. Jennie was her name. She always had a smile that could light up anyone’s day. She was the only real friend I ever had growing up. I loved being around her. So, when I turned 18 and was able to sign myself out of the care of my guardian, I did but not for any bad reason. I stated that the help and knowledge she provided me, along with the job she had helped me get was all above standard and that I wanted to lighten her workload. When that day came, she came up and gave me one of her famous hugs and told me these words.\n\n“You are so brave. Everything that you have gone through has only made you a better person. I know that the pain will never go away but use that to fuel your life. I am going to miss you but I know you will do great things. You are so special.” Those words are now mounted above my front door in my way too small dorm room. I would read them every day before I left. It kept me grounded. \n\nAfter high school I went to college up north, being from the mid-south it was quite the change. Seasons were more pronounced and the weather shifted in an instant. My freshman year in college started off normal enough. Good grades, held a job down at the local grocery store stocking shelves. I had a few grants for college but not enough for the full ride like most people. But when the Trust fund brigade came around campus, I couldn’t help but be resentful of them. Not because they came from money but because of the way I always heard them talk to their parents on their phones. Nothing was ever good enough for them. \n\n“Dad, my car broke down. Can you buy me a new one?” one of them said. He waited a few seconds for the reply and from his tone going forward I assume he didn’t like the answer. “Garages are dirty and the people there don’t know anything. Just get me a new one.” He replied, pressing the call end button and putting his phone in his pocket. That was the standard for them. Not one of them was what I would consider reasonable or nice. One day, I witnessed them take it too far and they started harassing some other students. Nothing physical thankfully but more on verbal and mental abuse. Which is just as bad and unforgivable. That’s when they noticed me in the commons area reading one of my fantasy novels. I tried to ignore them as they walked closer. Three guys all with suits on with a Fraternity emblem on the breast above their pocket. \n\n“Who are you and what are you doing in my commons area?” he asked. His voice got slightly higher than normal. \n\nI looked up from my book, “Your commons area? I don’t see your name on it anywhere plus I’m just reading my book. I’m of no harm here. Please leave me alone.” I said lowering my head back down to start reading again.\n\n“Why don’t you look behind you on that wall and tell me that again?” he demanded.\n\nI followed his request out of sheer curiosity and I saw a plaque behind me. \n\n“Commons Area paid for by Gregory Richardson the Second.” It read. \n\nI turned back around, “Are you Gregory Richardson the Second?” I asked. Within two seconds my face was pressed up against the plaque by the guy who approached me. He leaned in close and said, “My father paid for this. That makes it mine too. So, when I say leave, that means leave.” He said into my ear through his teeth. \n\n“Let him go, Greg.” A voice echoed through the commons. I felt Greg’s hand loosen from my head and I was able to slip out. He pushed me to the floor as he responded to the voice. \n\n“I’m handling Theta Pi Gamma business, Eric. Don’t get involved.” Greg said in a threatening but shaky tone. Just then two more people got up off the couches and stood beside Eric. One man and one woman. \n\n“Just leave Greg. We get it, your daddy's rich and you’re a spoiled brat who has never been told no before. Popular in high school but an annoyance here.” Eric said. Everyone in the commons stopped talking at that point.\n\n“Come on, guys. My dad paid for this place so that the poor had a place to go. This area is a pity case.” Greg blurted out. You could tell he was annoyed by the way he left. I just sat there in sheer enjoyment of that jerk finally getting called out on his crap. My enjoyment didn’t mask the tears from the pain from the side of my face. My right side indented with the inscription from the plaque. I look down away from everyone as I wipe the tears away. I opened my eyes to see three sets of feet in front of me. I look up hoping it wasn’t Greg and his goons again. It was Eric and his friends. He extends a hand toward me. \n\n“You look like you could use a friend. Come on, I’ll help you up.” \n\nI accepted his offer and he helped me up. I stand in front of the three. “I’m Eric…” he points behind him to his right “…that’s Will…” he points behind him on his left side “…and that’s Emily.” He stated. I sized Eric up as he was introducing me to everyone. He was around six feet tall, slender build with no real muscle mass. Will was quite the opposite; around five foot eight inches and about 250 pounds. And then I saw Emily up close for the first time. Five foot five inches, brown hair, green eyes, and a stance that kind of intimidated me. She was beautiful. \n\n“I hate those guys. They’ve been here for 4 years and every day is the same with them.” Eric said, putting his hand on my shoulder. I noticed everyone else in the commons get up and leave after Eric introduced himself. \n\n“Thanks for helping me. I was hoping they would leave me alone. My name is Ryan.” I said. \n\n“Nice to meet you, Ryan. And yeah, everyone hopes that. You might want to go wash your face before the annoyance rubs off on you.” Eric said, laughing a bit. “Bathrooms down the hall. We’ll walk with you to make sure they stay away.”\n\n“Yeah, don’t want to turn into that.” I said, cracking a smile. They walked me to the bathroom down the desolate halls that were once filled with students before the altercation. It seemed odd but who was I to pass up friends? We got to the bathroom and they waited outside. As I started to wash my face, I heard them talking just outside the door. It was muffled so I was only able to make out my name being said a few times. But they sounded friendly by the way their tone was. I push open the door to leave the bathroom. \n\n“Much better…” Eric said with his arms crossed. “…looking sharp.” Just then, my watch alarm went off. “Aw damn, I’m gonna be late for my Marketing class.” I said hastily. \n\n“Oh, creative brain huh?” Eric said. \n\n“Uh yeah, I always have ideas for things but never knew how to make them come to life. So, I decided that Marketing could be a great start.” I explained. I didn’t want them to judge me so I tried to hurry out of there. \n\n“Whoa, Professor Brewer doesn’t care about being a few minutes late, so you can walk there.” Eric said reassuringly. “Do you live on campus?” Eric asked. I felt weird about letting them know that I did but campus security is normally on top of things regarding the dorms. \n\n“Yeah, 143B, West wing.” I replied. “What about you guys?” I asked, returning the favor.\n\n“Yup, all three of us live on campus.” Eric said. “Do you wanna get food with us later?” Will asked, the first time hearing him speak. \n\nI thought it over for a moment. These three seem normal. And I was starting to get hungry. I was new around there and haven’t ventured much off of campus. “Yeah, sounds good.” I replied.\n\n“Let’s meet back here after Ryan’s class. At 6. His class ends at 5:45 right?” Eric asked.\n\n“Yeah, how did you know that?” I asked. \n\n“We’ve been here quite a while too.” Emily responded. \n\n“Oh okay, what are you guys studying?” I asked. I wanted to know a little more about my new found friends. \n\n“We can talk later at dinner…” Eric said. “…go you don’t want to be too late.”"},"386":{"title":"Trying to remember a creepypasta about a son and his father(or grandpa) driving down a highway","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fjjuat\/trying_to_remember_a_creepypasta_about_a_son_and\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"PacifisticBear","selftext":"I remember watching a video about it back in like 2015 or 2016, it was a creepypasta of a son and his grandpa or dad driving down a highway and the grandpa telling the boy not to look behind him or in the car mirror or something, the whole thing has a message of aging and the grandpa or dad slowly starts to age and everything gets fucked, then they're back to normal.\n\n\nIf anyone could help me find it it'd be awesome!"},"387":{"title":"My Ancestors Are Eldritch Abominations...

It was just the way it was and there was a photo shoot done of all the people who worked at the hospital, it was one big picture of every medical worker inside the hospital. \n\nWe hung the picture outside the hospital for the public to see. Then it didn't take long for the hospital to become quiet. We didn't have much patients coming to our hospital at all and this was highly strange. We were all experiencing boredom now, and there was a time where we hired a doctor who wasn't that attractive. That doctor took his own life for over work and that didn't sound right at all. Something was weirdly odd about this situation and the hospital wasn't getting any visitors for any medical problem.

Then I heard that people were doing home births and cleaning up their own wounds and stitching themselves up. Some were even trying to repair their own broken bones or just living with it, or even taking their own lives. This was all too concerning and I was in the dark until I read the note that the dead doctor had written, who had taken his own life for being over worked. \n\nPeople were coming to him in droves because the other doctors and even nurses were too pretty. They felt too embarrassed to go to anyone attractive within the hospital. Then as people started taking their own lived to be rid of physical pain, or just living with it in general, I had to go hire a load of unattractive doctors and nurses. Then we finally saw people coming into the hospital and people were being treated again. \n\nI had to let go of a load of attractive doctors and nurses, so that the patients felt more comfortable.

I’d rolled into my sleeping bag sometime after midnight, my face glowing with the soft blue light of my phone screen as I mindlessly scrolled through dumb memes and TikToks. The clock was ticking by, unnoticed. Until it wasn’t.\n\n3:33 AM.\n\nI don’t know why the sight of those numbers those three goddamn numbers made my skin prickle. But they did. Something about the stillness of that moment made the world feel... off. Like the air was different. Heavier. Colder. A weight settled over the room, pressing down on my chest.\n\nI glanced around. The laughter and chaos from earlier had evaporated, leaving behind the shallow breathing of my friends in their sleeping bags, the occasional twitch of someone caught in a dream. But the darkness it had teeth now. I swear it did. The shadows were longer, thicker, like they were something more than just the absence of light.\n\nAnd then I heard it. A slow, grating creak. The kind that made your bones feel cold. My gaze snapped to the closet door across the room. It wasn’t shut all the way, I knew that. But now it was opening. Just a crack. Slowly, as if someone or something was gently pushing it, testing the air.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. I waited, frozen, hoping it was just a draft. Yeah, right. The kind of explanation adults give to brush off the thing you know you saw, but they refuse to believe in. No draft opened doors this slow, this deliberate.\n\nAnother creak. The door inched open a little more, showing nothing but pitch-black darkness behind it. I stared, my heart doing a jittery dance in my chest, the kind where each beat feels like it might be the last before something terrible happens.\n\nI should’ve looked away. Hell, I wanted to look away. But I couldn’t. It was like that door had latched onto my brain, holding me captive. Every muscle in my body screamed at me to run, but all I did was watch, paralyzed, as the darkness inside the closet began to shift.\n\nThen it appeared a hand. Thin, grotesque, with skin like stretched leather over brittle bones, and nails so long and cracked they scraped the wooden floor. I tried to swallow, but my throat had closed up. All I could do was stare as the thing stepped out of the closet.\n\nA figure. It was human-shaped but barely. Black hair hung in tangled clumps over its face, covering everything except the faint gleam of its eyes. They glittered in the shadows, like they could see straight through me. The rest of it was shrouded in darkness, except for those filthy nails that clicked as it moved toward me.\n\nI wanted to scream. To wake up my friends. To do something. But the words were stuck, strangled in my chest. My mom. I needed her. I needed her to tell me everything was going to be okay, that it was just a bad dream.\n\nBut I knew better. I knew it wasn’t.\n\nBefore I could blink, it lunged at me fast, impossibly fast. Those nails found me, dug into my skin with a sickening, wet rip. I felt the pain before I saw the blood, and then I was screaming, screaming so loud I thought my throat would tear.\n\nAnd then I woke up.\n\nJust like that. One moment, that thing was clawing into me, pulling me into the blackness, and the next I was awake. The room was the same, but the light had shifted. The early hours of dawn hadn’t come, not yet. My heart was racing, beating so fast it hurt. My skin was clammy, my sleeping bag soaked with cold sweat.\n\nI sat up, trying to get a grip, trying to convince myself it had been just a dream, a nasty nightmare conjured up by too many ghost stories and too little sleep. I wiped my hands on my shirt, shaking.\n\nThat’s when I saw it.\n\n3:33 AM.\n\nThose numbers on my phone screen again. I stared at them for what felt like forever, my breath coming in shaky gasps. My brain kept telling me it was just a coincidence. That’s all. Nothing supernatural about a digital clock showing the same time twice in one night.\n\nBut something was wrong. I was wrong.\n\nI turned my head, dreading what I might see, knowing deep down that whatever had come from the closet in my dream wasn’t gone. It was here, and it was real. I forced my eyes toward the closet, praying the door would be shut. But it wasn’t.\n\nIt was open. Wide open.\n\nAnd from inside, something moved. Something was waiting.\n\nThen I heard it again the creak. The slow, deliberate groan of the closet door creeping open... all over again.\n\n"},"396":{"title":"I heard it too","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fj2l1h\/i_heard_it_too\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"Title: \"I Heard It Too.\"\nBy: StoryLord\n\nAs Sarah lay in bed, engrossed in her TikTok feed, the tranquility of the late evening was shattered by her mother’s call, “Sarahhhh.”\n\nThe sound reverberated through the house, prompting Sarah to reluctantly set her phone aside. Slipping out from under the covers, she approached her bedroom door cautiously. With a hesitant glance to her left, she surveyed the dimly lit hallway beyond, the staircase entrance looming in the shadows.\n\n“Sarahhhh.” The call echoed once more, this time seemingly emanating from the depths of the dark staircase. With a mixture of curiosity and apprehension, Sarah approached, her heart pounding in her chest. Peering down into the abyss, she felt a shiver run down her spine as the darkness seemed to swallow her whole.\n\nAs Sarah stood at the top of the stairs, the darkness below seemed to reach up like a living thing, a thick, viscous blackness that enveloped the wooden steps in a suffocating embrace. It was not merely an absence of light; it was a presence, heavy and oppressive, that whispered of unseen horrors lurking just out of sight. The air felt charged, as if the very molecules held their breath in anticipation, and an instinctual shiver crawled up her spine.\n\nHer heart raced, pounding in her chest like a caged animal, each beat echoing in the silence that surrounded her. The shadows at the bottom of the staircase seemed to shift and writhe, as though something was coiling within them, waiting for her to take that one fateful step down into the abyss. An unsettling sensation prickled at her skin, a warning that whatever lay below was not merely darkness, but a formless terror that thrived on fear.\n\nEvery instinct told her to turn away, to retreat back into the safety of her room, yet she found herself drawn to the staircase, her gaze locked onto the inky void. It was as if the shadows were alive, beckoning her to come closer, to delve deeper into their secrets. Each moment stretched painfully, the silence pressing against her ears like a weight, filled with the promise of something sinister just out of reach.\n\nIn that moment, the staircase transformed from a simple set of steps into a gaping maw, ready to swallow her whole. The shadows whispered her name in a chorus of muted voices, echoing through the stillness, a haunting melody that twisted her stomach into knots. As she stared down, a feeling of dread settled over her like a damp cloak, the kind that seeped into your bones and whispered of things best left undiscovered.\n\nAgain, her name reverberated through the house, unmistakably her mother’s voice. “Sarahhhh.” The echo persisted, sending chills down her spine.\n\nSuddenly, her mother burst out of her own room, gripping Sarah’s arms tightly. Together, they fled back to Sarah’s room, the fear palpable in the air.\n\nBreathless and trembling, Sarah’s mother whispered, “I heard it too.”\n\nAs panic surged through her veins, Sarah hastily barricaded the door, her heart racing with each thud of her pounding footsteps. “Sarahhh,” the voice persisted, now ominously close, as if it were right outside the door.\n\nWith a sense of urgency, she scooped up her child, seeking refuge in the closet. As she handed her trembling child the phone, her voice firm with resolve, “Call the police. Do not leave this closet. I’ll be back.”\n\nLeaving her child in the safety of the closet, Sarah dashed back into the darkness, her mind racing with fear and determination to confront whatever lurked beyond the safety of her barricaded door.\n\nHer mom gave her a tender kiss on the forehead and whispered, “Be careful. Don’t do anything stupid.”\n\n“SARAHHH!” The voice thundered louder, sending shockwaves of fear through the room. Sarah’s mom swiftly closed the closet door, her heart racing as she fortified herself for what lay ahead.\n\nHer mom, grabbing the lamp from atop the dresser, wrapped the cord around it, holding it like a makeshift weapon in a defensive stance. Outside, the relentless pounding on the door intensified, causing cracks to spiderweb across its surface.\n\n“Sarahhh,” the voice echoed once more, sending chills down her spine. With determination etched on her face, Sarah’s mom braced herself for whatever awaited on the other side of the splintering door.\n\nWith adrenaline coursing through her veins, Sarah’s grip tightened on the phone as she struggled to maintain her composure. “911, what’s your emergency?” the operator’s voice came through the line.\n\n“Someone broke into my house,” Sarah whispered, tears streaming down her face, her voice trembling with fear.\n\n“It’s gonna be okay. What’s your location so we can send help?” the operator reassured.\n\n“Sarahhhh?” The voice interrupted once more, freezing Sarah in her tracks as she struggled to find the words to respond.\n\n“1234 Elm Street, Springfield, Anytown, USA 12345,” Sarah relayed to the operator, her voice still trembling with fear.\n\n“That’s good, you’re doing great. We’re sending police to your location right now,” the operator assured her. “Do you know what the intruder looks like?”\n\n“No,” Sarah replied in a shaky voice, her mind racing with uncertainty and dread.\n\nAs the tense silence enveloped the room, Sarah’s heart raced in anticipation. Suddenly, a deafening crash shattered the stillness as the creature slammed against the door with bone-rattling force. The wood groaned and splintered, resisting the onslaught for a brief moment before succumbing to the overwhelming power.\n\nWith agonizing slowness, the door buckled under the relentless assault, each creak and crack echoing through the room like a death knell. Sarah’s breath caught in her throat as she watched in horror, every second stretching into an eternity of dread.\n\nFinally, with a thunderous boom, the door exploded inward, sending shards of wood flying in all directions. Time seemed to stand still as the monstrous silhouette of the creature loomed in the doorway, its twisted form silhouetted against the dim light of the room.\n\nThe creature had a long neck, its face grotesquely resembling her mother’s but twisted in a way that defied nature, an unnatural distortion that made the skin crawl. Its long limbs stretched all the way to its knees, the arms too long, too thin. The creature’s smile was stuck wide, devoid of teeth, creating an unsettling grin. Its eyes appeared melted, shaped like misshapen orbs that looked like they were oozing down its face, devoid of any life. Her hair, neatly styled just like her mother’s, hung in twisted, unkempt locks, an uncanny echo of the woman Sarah knew.\n\nWith a guttural roar, it surged forward, a nightmarish vision of chaos and despair.\n\nIn that moment, Sarah’s mom knew that her worst fears had come to life, and that she would be face-to-face with a terror beyond comprehension.\n\nThe creature burst into the room, its distorted face casting a shadow of fear and despair. Its skin, pallid and sickly, seemed stretched too tight over its skeletal frame. As Sarah’s mother lunged forward, wielding the lamp as her only weapon against the monstrous intruder, the creature unleashed a devastating force, hurling her across the room with frightening power. The sickening sound of bones cracking echoed through the air as her head collided with the wall, her life extinguished instantly by the brutal impact.\n\nSarah watched in horror as her mother’s lifeless body crumpled to the ground, her heart breaking at the sight of the ultimate sacrifice made to protect her. Trembling with grief and rage, Sarah knew she had to act fast to survive the nightmarish ordeal unfolding before her.\n\n“SAAAARRRAAAHHH!!!!,” the creature’s chilling scream echoed through the room, and Sarah’s heart pounded in her chest, her breaths shallow and ragged as she struggled to remain silent. Tears streamed down her face, her hands trembling with fear as she pressed them against her mouth, stifling any sound that threatened to escape.\n\nThe creature erupted into a whirlwind of chaos, moving with a speed that defied all logic, a blur of limbs and twisted features that left no room for doubt it was an embodiment of pure malevolence. It lunged at the walls, its long fingers scraping against the paint like a deranged artist possessed by a sinister muse. Each scratch tore through the drywall with a screeching protest, sending a shower of dust and debris cascading to the floor.\n\nIn an instant, the creature swept across the room, launching the lamp from the dresser with a flick of its wrist. The lamp flew through the air, shattering against the far wall, its shattered glass glimmering like fallen stars on the floor. The bed shook violently as the creature seized it, tossing the mattress aside with the casual disdain of a child discarding a toy. The dresser followed suit, toppling over with a thunderous crash, drawers spilling their contents clothes, knickknacks, and memories like a storm of forgotten lives unleashed upon the floor.\n\nA cacophony of chaos ensued, the room transforming into a nightmare tableau of disorder. Pillows fluffed into the air like caught whispers, clothes entwined with broken pieces of the lamp, and the air filled with the acrid scent of fear and desperation. Every object became a projectile in the creature’s frenzy, a testament to its inhuman rage, as it reveled in the destruction, a deranged conductor leading an orchestra of despair.\n\nIn mere moments, the once-cozy sanctuary of Sarah’s room had become a scene of utter devastation, a chaotic reflection of the dread that coiled within her chest. The creature’s laughter if it could even be called that echoed in the corners of her mind, a haunting reminder of the nightmare she had stumbled into.\n\nWith bated breath, Sarah listened as the footsteps of the creature faded away, leaving behind an eerie silence that seemed to suffocate her. “Sarahhh,” it echoed once more, a haunting reminder of the terror that lurked just beyond her hiding place.\n\nMeanwhile, on the phone, the caller’s voice broke through the silence, a faint lifeline in the darkness. “You’re still there, what’s that noise?” The caller asked, but Sarah couldn’t bring herself to respond. With trembling hands, she gently placed the phone on the floor, her gaze fixed on the room door before her, the door left ajar.\n\nSummoning every ounce of courage she had left, Sarah slowly and cautiously pushed the closet door open, just enough to peer out into the room. And there, in the dim light, she saw the devastating sight that awaited her a horrifying tableau of death and despair. Her mother’s lifeless body sat upright, her head crushed by the brutal impact with the wall, blood dripping in a macabre rhythm onto the floor below.\n\nTears welled in Sarah’s eyes as she beheld the tragic scene before her, her world crumbling around her with each passing moment. But amid the overwhelming grief and fear, one thought burned bright in her mind a determination to survive, no matter the cost.\n\nAs Sarah crawled closer to her mother’s lifeless body, her heart shattered into a million pieces. Tears streamed down her cheeks, mingling with the blood from her injured hand as she reached out to touch her mother one last time.\n\nBut before she could even process the horror of her situation, the voice called out again, closer this time, “Saraahhh,” sending a surge of panic through her veins. With a jolt of fear, Sarah scrambled back, her hand grazing against the jagged edges of the broken wood on the floor, drawing blood.\n\n“SARAHHHH!!!!!!!!” The voice thundered louder, echoing through the room like a primal roar. Sarah’s body froze in terror as the creature burst into the room, its eyes locking onto her with an intensity that sent shivers down her spine.\n\nUnable to move, Sarah could only watch in horror as the creature approached her, its twisted form reaching out to embrace her. But instead of comfort, Sarah felt a wave of revulsion wash over her, pushing the creature away with all her strength.\n\nAs she tried to flee, the creature’s grasp tightened around her, dragging her back with a force that seemed inhuman. Sarah fought desperately, clawing at the floor, but it was futile. With a bone-chilling scream, she was dragged out of the room, her cries for help echoing through the empty house until they were swallowed by the darkness.\n\n“AAAAHHHHHH!”\n\nAnd with that chilling scream, Sarah’s harrowing ordeal came to a close, her fate sealed by the malevolent force that had invaded her home.\n\nWith every repetition of her name, the echoes seemed to grow fainter, yet somehow more sinister, as if the darkness itself was whispering her fate. And as the last haunting syllable faded into the night, the creature dragged her off, enveloped in a silence that echoed louder than any scream.\n\n“Saaraahh.”\n\nThe End.\n\n---\nI wrote the story I didn't come up with it but I wrote it myself based on what I remembered from the video.\n\nThe original story animation video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/HAqBh5KDFgQ?si=YNIADhWhFz-yiXZJ\n\n"},"397":{"title":"the journey of a curious soul ( comic book pitch ) ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fiyx6h\/the_journey_of_a_curious_soul_comic_book_pitch\/","flair":"Images &amp; Comics","author":"gacoldfish","selftext":"\\_ Imagine a man whose head gets bigger every time he takes a step.

Here’s my theory, pieced together from various cryptic elements and recurring themes:\n\n---\n\n**1. The Characters:**\n\n- **Aidan:** A central figure in the narrative. His backstory involves a tragic event where his son was killed by an intruder who broke into their home. The pervasive use of peanut butter in the videos seems to symbolize blood, intensifying the dark atmosphere surrounding his story.\n\n- **Nadia:** Likely Aidan's wife. Hints towards this include references to a wedding and the resemblance of her name to \"Aidan.\" This connection suggests she may play a crucial role in the unfolding story.\n\n- **Nutter Butter Clown:** Originates from old Nutter Butter commercials where he gave out cookies to children on playgrounds, promoting the notion of accepting sweets from strangers. This character has been reintroduced in the TikTok videos as a symbol of chaos and menace.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Videos and Themes:**\n\n- **Password Video:** Features a sequence where numbers are replaced by Nutter Butters, and an incorrect code triggers a warning from the Clown saying, “don’t you dare.” This might hint at hidden access or secrets.\n\n- **Aidan’s Name:** The name “Aidan” appears on various objects, and the text “uɐpıɐ” (Aidan reversed) suggests a connection to Nadia. It could symbolize either Nadia herself or a deeper reason for the reversed name.\n\n- **Wedding Symbolism:** An auto with the license plate \"ai4an\" and cans attached to it appears in one video, possibly indicating a wedding or a significant event related to Aidan and Nadia.\n\n- **Child’s Death:** A video shows a child (depicted by a Nutter Butter) being attacked with peanut butter, which may symbolize the child’s violent end. This ties back to the overall dark theme.\n\n- **Christmas Gift:** Aidan receives a gift filled with peanut butter. This reinforces the macabre theme and the ongoing symbolism of peanut butter as blood.\n\n- **Interactive Elements:** Some videos instruct viewers to share them with others, adding an interactive layer to the narrative. This could be part of a larger plan or secret message.\n\n- **Diary with Symbols:** The diary reappears with encrypted symbols, suggesting there are still hidden messages to be decoded or clues yet to be uncovered.\n\n---\n\n**3. Cryptic Messages and Symbols:**\n\n- **“You have been visited by the Nutter Butter Man”**: This message implies the visitor’s intentions are unclear, and there’s a call to share the video to ensure Aidan’s return.\n\n- **“Help me Papa”**: This could indicate a plea for help from a child (the small Nutter Butter) in distress, possibly connecting to the theme of Aidan’s family tragedy.\n\n- **Encoded Text:** “Zozy jt csbot zfbs 1” appears in the diary, adding another layer of mystery that may need further decoding.\n\n---\n\n**4. Possible Connections and Theories:**\n\n- **Nadia’s Role:** If Nadia is Aidan's wife, her involvement in the story might be crucial, especially in relation to the wedding and her connection to Aidan.\n\n- **Symbolism of Peanut Butter:** Peanut butter appears as a symbol for blood, enhancing the horror and surreal aspects of the story. This symbolism may represent deeper themes of violence and loss.\n\n---\n\nOverall, the Nutter Butter TikTok account seems to be creating a rich and unsettling narrative using surreal imagery, cryptic messages, and interactive storytelling. The connections between characters, especially Aidan and Nadia, along with the recurring themes of violence and mystery, suggest a complex and hidden story that fans are only beginning to uncover. \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or any additional clues you might have!\n"},"399":{"title":"Nightmare's Echo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fiz4lw\/nightmares_echo\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"Nightmare's Echo\nBy StoryLord\n\nThe TV flickered, casting restless, jittering shadows that danced across the living room walls. I sat on the couch, fighting to stay awake, the low murmur of the late-night news playing like background static. Sleep had been coming in fits and starts these days, with exhaustion gnawing at the edges of my mind, threatening to pull me under. That’s when it happened.\n\nThe scream.\n\nIt wasn’t just any scream, though it was my son’s. You don’t mistake something like that. It was sharp, like a nail driven into your brain, the kind of scream that rips you from whatever half-slumber you’ve been clinging to and makes your heart stutter in your chest.\n\nI was off the couch before I even realized I was moving, feet slapping against the hardwood, the old floorboards creaking under my weight. The hallway felt darker than usual, like the shadows were pressing in, clinging to me. The scream still echoed in my head as I reached his room. My hand paused on the doorknob. Why? I don’t know. Maybe because some primal part of me knew that whatever was in there wasn’t normal. It wasn’t just a bad dream.\n\nI twisted the knob, the door groaning as it swung open.\n\nMy son was sitting up in bed, huddled under his blanket, his small body trembling like a leaf in the wind. His face was wet with tears, wide-eyed and terrified. I rushed to his side, feeling that same old wave of helplessness I’d come to know too well.\n\n\"Daddy,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible, \"there’s a monster under my bed.\"\n\nI forced a smile, that old, practiced lie rising to the surface. \"There are no monsters, buddy,\" I said, my voice sounding too thin, too strained.\n\nBut his eyes...his eyes said something different. They were too wild, too full of a terror that didn’t belong to the world of a child. He wasn’t just scared he was knowing. His finger, trembling, pointed downward, toward the dark space beneath his bed.\n\nI knelt beside him, my knees pressing into the cold floor, and looked under the bed, expecting hoping to find nothing but dust and forgotten toys. But instead, I saw something that made my stomach lurch. My son was under the bed. The real him.\n\nHis face was streaked with tears, his little hands clamped tight over his mouth, holding back a sob as his wide, pleading eyes stared into mine. He removed his hands just long enough to whisper, “Daddy, there’s a monster on my bed.”\n\nMy throat tightened. I slowly looked back up, knowing what I was about to see but praying I was wrong.\n\nSitting on the bed was the thing. The thing that looked like my son, but wasn’t. It sat there with a strange, almost mechanical stillness, its head cocked at an unnatural angle. Its skin was pale, the kind of pale that doesn’t belong to anything alive, and its eyes...Jesus, those eyes. They were nothing but dark, empty voids, sucking in the light around them, swallowing it whole.\n\nAnd that smile. That twisted, impossible smile that stretched far too wide across its face, showing rows of jagged, needle-like teeth, each one glinting in the faint moonlight streaming through the window. The thing moved, its body jerking in sharp, staccato motions, like a marionette controlled by invisible strings.\n\nBefore I could react, it lunged at me.\n\nIts long, clawed fingers clamped around my throat, cold and impossibly strong, pinning me to the floor. My mind screamed, but no sound came out. It held me there, those hollow eyes staring down at me, and then it did the unthinkable. Its other hand, those filthy, blackened claws, reached for my face. I felt the sharp, bone-like nails dig into my skin, ripping through the flesh with a sickening, wet sound.\n\nIt tore into me, peeling the skin from my face like a butcher skinning an animal. The pain was beyond anything I could have imagined white-hot, blinding. I felt my own blood running down my neck, felt the air hit the raw, exposed muscle beneath. It was like every nerve in my body had been set on fire. My vision swam, and the room tilted as my own face my face was ripped apart in a frenzy of violence.\n\nI wanted to scream, but my voice was caught in my throat. All I could do was gurgle, blood filling my mouth, choking me. My hands flailed uselessly, trying to fight back, but the thing was too strong. It loomed over me, its teeth bared in that grotesque, rictus grin, and then...\n\nI woke up.\n\nJust like that. I sat bolt upright on the couch, gasping for air, drenched in cold sweat. My heart was hammering in my chest, the adrenaline still pumping through my veins. The TV was still on, the light flickering, throwing more of those damn shadows across the room. For a second, I just sat there, breathing hard, trying to make sense of it. It had been a nightmare, just a nightmare. But God, it had felt so real.\n\nInstinctively, I reached up and touched my face, expecting to feel the slick, torn mess I’d just experienced. But no. My face was intact. Whole. I let out a shaky breath, relief flooding through me.\n\nThat’s when I heard it.\n\nThe scream.\n\nIt was my son again. His terrified cry echoed down the hallway, the same blood-curdling sound that had torn me from sleep in the first place. My stomach dropped. This time, it wasn’t a dream.\n\nI stood, every step toward his room heavy, as if the air itself was thick with dread. The door was ajar, just a sliver of darkness waiting for me.\n\nI knew, in the pit of my soul, that whatever had been in my dream...wasn’t just in my head. It was still here.\n\nGod help us both.\n\n"},"400":{"title":"Need help finding an old creepypasta reading video.

The video I believe was uploaded on YouTube sometime in the early 2010s or even earlier. The title of the video was something along the lines of \"**The worst thing a parent could experience**.\" It was in the format of a creepypasta reading, with some old images of children, primarily schoolchildren, in a slide-show format. There was a female\/feminine-sounding narrator who explained a condition in which some children would refuse to eat food given to them in school because they believed there was something inside it. So much so that they screamed and freaked out. The video ends with some really creepy edits of the children's faces, and pitch-shifted audio of children crying and yelling. Growing up, I think this video was one of my childhood traumas.

The following story is depicted exactly how I remember it. Yes I use audio enhancements and what not.. but I haven't a clue how I'd even go about even coming remotely close to producing something like this.. Reddit sucks for telling stories so I'm limited where I can even post this because I just keep getting banned for \"self promotion.\" I couldn't care less.. I enjoy making videos for fun but im not looking for fame. I'm only posting this because I just want to know what in the actual fk this is!!!! \n\n--------------------\nSummary at Bottom\n\n**Video at Bottom before description spoils it**\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Encounter:\n\n  I caught this encounter on video in July 17th of this year - 2024.\n\n  I'm super experienced with extreme rugged camping. I avoid cold at all costs - not my cup o' tea but heat and rugged; I adore.\n\n  I ride out on quad usually to remote locations.. Often cowboy camp.. Literally just facedown in the mud\/dirt\/sand, you name it ect... occasionally. \n\n  This year I ventured out. Found an off grid site that had an old Iron trash can as a fire pit and a Picnic table. \n\n  Middle of boonie nowhere.\n\n  About 10 minutes go by after I shut the quad off, I begun hearing these odd screaming sounds with reverb off in the far South-East distance of my position - moving North-East.\n\n  Didn't think much of it at all, firstly.. Thought some fired up riders passing through or something as quite common.. It being a Tuesday though, barely seen anybody out there the entire week until friday.\n\n  I do NOT scare easily AT ALL.\n\n  Finally noticed it getting closer and closer to me.\n\n  That's when I started rolling film..\n\n  It sounded like a male adult primally screaming in dying agony, some type of creature, and either an adult female screaming or small child screaming - All at once with reverb. The way the sound was bouncing through the trees was downright bizarre. No echo I've ever really heard in my life in the woods or... anywhere really..\n\n  It all suddenly phased into sounding like it was completely surrounding all around me at this point a few yards beyond the tree line. (Imagine hearing screaming in a specific direction and it suddenly clicks to sounding like it's all around you.)\n\n  It all suddenly halts.\n\n  I then hear semi-unintelligible words screaming from the male with reverb, in the north-west of my location.\n\n  The female \/ little child screams back from same location.\n\n  More word screaming commenced as some other rider came up chasing after it for whatever reason..\n\n  I halted the guy on the bike and he said he had no idea what it was, but was following it try and see what it was. - No clue how he even came across whatever this was...\n\n  It begun moving quick off in the distance again and the rider took off immediately there after.\n\n  No clue wth it was personally or why guy was even trying see what it was...\n\n  Never heard anything like this in my entire life of camping\/riding and I have completed hundreds of excursions at this point..\n\n  Was never spooked for some odd reason either through the entire experience... Looking back, I sure as shite should have been no doubt at all. But for some reason... I just simply listened and recorded.\n\n  I've listened to the recording a million times over and I still have zero clue.... At all....\n\n  The state I was in is known for Wolfman and other cryptids if one believes in folklore as such I suppose.. I've never encountered any creatures eyes-on in my life so I can't say personally if they exist or not. I don't dismiss anything as it can't be totally ruled out. Life is mysterious in general so I stay open minded.\n\n  I simply have absolute zero clue what I encountered that night and it's still driving me nuts..\n\n  Anyone out there think this is drunkards or something..?\n\n  Just for reference because this has been stated in another post - No mountain lions exist in the state I was in.... The possibility of mountain lions being rouge can't be ruled out obviously... But I don't think they speak English lol or at least what resembled English to me in the experience and video...\n\n  I even recently returned and took a trip back to the same exact location.. Passed out in the dirt\/sand for a few and awoken around 11:20PM.. Didn't feel like camping there a full night again because I wanted to explore new locations to camp so I ended up taking off... \n\n  Which I am in the process of making another video of that trip but it's nothing spectacular by any means.. No occurrences took place at all. Barely even any wild life for the three days I was out there...\n\n  I have a short version of this but I'm providing the long version due to it being so much more clear regarding sound.. Because I overlaid a video ontop just for a good intro in the beginning...... and there's other proof within the video of possibilities of being completely ruled out..\n\n  Anyone out there want to take a stabb at what this could be??? ...Because I'm clueless...\n\nLike I said, I don't scare easily at all. In the moment, I even remember at one point I thought, \"should I scream back?\"... Just to see wth would happen.. but common sense kept me from it since I had no clue what I was dealing with.. Still 50\/50 kicking myself for lol\n\nWasn't spooked at all in the moment but now.. Every. Single. Time... I listen to these sounds, my hair stands like static..\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n (*Summary*) I just arrived at an off grid campsite to cowboy camp.. about 10 mins go by and I begin hearing these these otherworldly sounds I barely even have a definition or words for... far off in the south-east distance..  caught it on video as I noticed it was coming closer.. sounded like it was all around me at one point... word screaming begun and then a rider came up shortly after chasing it.. halted rider to ask. Didn't provide much info.. the rider took off as the sounds faded off in the north-west of my location..\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nI did not use any lights for two reasons.. It'd give away my location for one.. since I had no clue of what I was dealing with.. and two. The tree line was downright beyond thick so I knew I wouldnt see jack S...\n\nI'm now actively working with a few other audio specialists to see if I can drown out the white noise and isolate the vocals.. Will provide update(s) when it's done!\n\n  Enjoy I suppose..!\n\n  High strangeness begins at 8:00 mark.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/GJnpqJpZW5s?si=N-Z2E97EAT7P5V_p\""},"403":{"title":"Need help finding a story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fiy87e\/need_help_finding_a_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Vohems","selftext":"I read this a while back.

They laughed it off, as you do with ghost stories around the campfire—until curiosity got the better of me. I decided to dig deeper, letting my fascination overtake rationality.\n\nThe official story was that in the late 1940s, Soviet researchers had tested the limits of human endurance by depriving five test subjects of sleep for 15 consecutive days. They’d conducted the experiment in a sealed chamber, bombarding the men with gas that would keep them awake. After several harrowing days of silence, the men’s sanity began to unravel, which seemed to culminate in the most grotesque of outcomes.\n\nDespite the horror of the tale, I created a detailed outline for my own research paper, wanting to unveil the truths buried in speculation. Armed with my laptop and a drive to discover the unknown, I found myself knee-deep in dark web forums. It felt clandestine, maybe even thrilling—until I stumbled onto something I thought I’d only read in scared whispers.\n\nThe forums were filled with accounts of survivors, people who claimed to have experienced something akin to the original experiment—people who recounted chilling tales of being tested beyond the limits of sanity. They described shadowy figures lurking in rooms, whispers echoing in the dark, and the maddening sound of never-ending machinery. I instantly felt a gnawing fear, but pressed on.\n\nThen I found a hidden thread titled “The Final Stages.” It was as if I had entered a realm of lost souls, each post more harrowing than the last. The details became horrific—participants claiming they could still feel the effects of sleep deprivation. Some could hear voices calling their names, while others felt an inexplicable compulsion to tear at their own flesh. I nearly shut my laptop, but a lingering curiosity gnawed at me. I had to know.\n\nI continued to explore, discovering researchers who theorized that the gas wasn’t merely a stimulant; it fed on fear and desperation. I instinctively locked my door, brushing off the growing dread. I knew it was just stories, a blend of paranoia and fictional splendor, but something in my gut told me to be cautious.\n\nSuddenly, I lost the light outside my window; a blaring storm gripped my small apartment. Thunder cracked like a whip, sending a jolt through my body. I stared into the night, my heart racing. The sound of rain pounded against the glass, but then… beneath it, was a new sound—a soft whisper.\n\n“Stay awake… don’t drift…”\n\nI shook my head, heart in my throat. I attributed it to the storm playing tricks on my mind, the tales of the experiment amplifying my fears. Desperate to shake off this creeping terror, I switched off the screen and tried to distract myself with music, but it wasn’t enough. I felt an unsettling presence in the room, as if I was being watched.\n\nThat night, every time I closed my eyes, I slipped into images from the horror stories. My dreams were twisted, reminiscent of the forgotten thread—visions of shadowy figures and swirling mists tormenting me. I stumbled to my feet, splashing cold water on my face, but the whispers persisted, haunting me in every reflective surface.\n\nThe next day was agonizing. I could hardly keep my eyes open, the very act of blinking felt too taxing. I tried to abandon my research, but a part of me was tethered to those narratives. Desperate for a reprieve, I pulled out my phone and browsed through the forum again—only to find my own username tagged in a new post: “You’ve awakened them.”\n\nPanic coursed through me as I skimmed the words:\n\n“Be wary of the shadows. They can feel your despair. You cannot escape what has followed.”\n\nMy breath quickened; I felt sick. I staggered backwards, my shaking legs barely holding me. The light in my room flickered violently. My mind whirred, speeding through the implications. I dashed to the window, but the storm was gone. Only silence remained, an eerie stillness that suffocated the remnants of tension.\n\nHours turned to days, and sleep deprivation clawed at my sanity. I tried to rationalize—to convince myself it was all in my mind. I canceled plans, stepped away from everything, becoming a hermit cloistered in my apartment. I could hear it whispering when the light faded, drowned in shadows too thick to behold.\n\nThere were moments when I thought I glimpsed them—the shadows lurking just out of view. The whispers grew louder: “Stay awake… stay with us…”\n\nI dated the walls with my despair, spiraling further into madness, and at the brink of losing myself, I attempted to find solace in sleep. Each time I let myself drift, the darkness taunted me, pulling me into horrifying landscapes where the gas seeped into my veins and memories melted away.\n\nI would wake in cold sweats, my heart racing, surrounded by the darkness of my own making. The shadows danced, wrapping around me tighter, pulling me closer. Bewildered, alone, my screams echoed—unheard.\n\nTime became fluid, a greyscale blur of the real and the unreal. My friends had grown concerned; they knocked on my door, but I couldn't let them in—I couldn't risk exposing them to the shadows that craved company.\n\nThen one night, in the suffocating darkness, the whispers crescendoed into a roar. I sprang out of bed, eyes wide, my chest heaving. I was trapped in the delusion of my making. I felt hands on me—cold, skeletal fingers reaching, pulling, suffocating me amid their deafening chorus.\n\nI broke. I opened the door to the outside world, where the first light of dawn painted the sky. But the moment I stepped outside, the whispers retreated, slinking into the shadows. I'd succeeded in waking from the darkness.\n\nOnly, when I turned, back towards my apartment, I noticed something etched into my door, a message only I could see.\n\n“Thank you for keeping us awake.”\n\nNow, I write this from the solitude of an asylum, where doctors keep me under watch. They say it's the sleep deprivation playing tricks on my mind, but I know the truth. They keep me here—not to save me, but because they're afraid. Afraid of what’s still lurking within me.\n\nEvery night, when the lights go dim, they forget to check on me, leaving me with the whispers. The shadows cling to the walls in my room, becoming more vivid. I can feel their presence like an insatiable caress.\n\nAnd despite the medication, the screams—unanswered—carry through these sterile walls. I realize now that the experiment never truly ended; I am merely their vessel. In the depths of night, I forsake sleep and dive into their embrace, waiting for the next willing soul to awaken their hunger.\n\nWhen they come, I'll welcome them. Until then, I remain awake. Forever awake."},"405":{"title":"Futurehoot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fikjwb\/futurehoot\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"This is a story I’ve kept bottled up for years. It haunts me still, like an old wound that never quite heals. It was back in December of 2012 one of those gray, cold days, the kind that creeps into your bones and stays there. I was doing Christmas shopping for my son, wandering the aisles, half-focused on the usual holiday crap wrapping paper, toys, the stuff that clutters your cart and your mind. I wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nAn owl toy, nestled between a row of plastic action figures and cheap, flashy trinkets. But this thing wasn’t like the others. It stood out, even in the dull store light. Its feathers shimmered in shades of blue and silver, gleaming unnaturally, almost like the thing was glowing from the inside out. It was... mesmerizing. But there was something wrong about it. Its glass eyes, glossy and too alive, seemed to follow me as I reached for it.\n\nThere were two buttons on its belly. One shaped like a sun, the other like a crescent moon. The buttons were small, almost insignificant, but something inside me some instinct I’d long stopped listening to whispered to leave it alone.\n\nI didn’t.\n\nI pressed the moon.\n\nThe change was instant. The feathers warmed under my hand, soft, real like I was touching a living thing. Then, its eyes. They blinked to life, glowing a sickly green. I should’ve put it down, walked away. But I couldn’t. The air around me thickened, the kind of thick that makes you feel like you’re not alone, like something else is there with you, breathing down your neck.\n\n\"Greetings, seeker of truths,\" it said, its voice soft but with an ancient rasp, like a whisper on the wind that had traveled too far. \"You have chosen the path of the night, where dreams and secrets intertwine.\"\n\nThe words sank into me, icy and sharp, and before I knew it, I was hooked.\n\n“Ask your question,\" it whispered, \"and I shall reveal the future hidden within the shadows.\"\n\nI wanted to throw it down, run out of the store, but I didn’t. Instead, I heard myself ask, \"How will I get home today?\"\n\nThe lights flickered once, twice, and then went out completely, plunging the store into suffocating darkness. My heart hammered in my chest, the silence around me thick and impenetrable. And then just then the owl’s eyes glowed brighter, cutting through the black like twin orbs of neon.\n\nIts voice, smooth as silk but hollow, slithered into the darkness:\n\n\"In the dark, the owl’s eyes gleam,\nShining bright, like a haunting dream.\nFuture’s coming, can’t you see?\nA twist of fate awaits for thee.\"\n\nThe rhyme echoed in my head, bouncing off the walls of my mind like a cruel joke.\n\n\"Round and round, the shadows play,\nSecrets whisper, night turns to day.\nHear the warning, don’t be rash,\nIn a flash, there’s a car crash.\"\n\nI felt my breath catch, my stomach tighten as the last words slipped from the owl’s beak. Then the lights sputtered back on, weak, flickering like dying stars. My legs felt like lead, but I turned, scanning the aisle around me, and that’s when I saw him.\n\nA man or something like one was standing at the far end of the aisle, just beyond the toys. He didn’t move, didn’t blink. His face was pale, too pale, and his head... it wasn’t right. His head was the shape of an owl. A twisted, grotesque mockery of the toy in my hand. The hollow sockets where his eyes should’ve been stared at me, empty and consuming.\n\nI blinked.\n\nThe lights came fully on, bright and harsh. The figure was gone.\n\nI stood frozen, my hands shaking, the toy still clutched in my grip. I wanted to believe it was some trick of the light, a figment of my overactive imagination, but deep down, I knew better. The owl toy had known knew everything and whatever it was, it had seen me too. And it wasn’t done with me yet.\n\nI stood there, trembling, my heart racing in the sudden quiet of the store. The aisles felt like they were closing in on me, the bright lights almost too much, blinding in their harshness. I glanced at the owl toy, its feathers still shimmering faintly, and the sickly green glow of its eyes flickering like a distant memory in my mind.\n\n“What was that?” I whispered to myself, half-expecting the owl to respond again. But there was only silence, thick and suffocating. I hesitated, my instincts battling with my curiosity. I should have dropped the toy and run, but instead, I found myself drawn to it, the weight of its promise and the chilling knowledge of what it might reveal anchoring me in place.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but the air was charged, crackling with something unnameable. As I forced my feet to move, I made my way toward the checkout, the rows of toys blurring in my peripheral vision. I could feel the weight of the owl’s gaze, as if it were a living entity watching me from within my grasp.\n\n“Just a toy,” I muttered, trying to convince myself, but the words felt hollow. The echoes of the owl’s rhyme reverberated in my mind, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted in the fabric of reality, that this was not just another mundane shopping trip.\n\nAs I approached the register, the cashier a bored-looking teenager with headphones dangling around her neck glanced up, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Is that... an owl?” she asked, a hint of confusion creeping into her voice.\n\n“Uh, yeah.” I forced a laugh, but it came out shaky. “I just found it. Weird, huh?”\n\nHer gaze fell to the toy, and she raised an eyebrow. “I’ve never seen one like that. Kind of unsettling, don’t you think?”\n\nI nodded, feeling a chill run down my spine. “Yeah, it is. But it caught my eye.”\n\nShe began scanning my items, but as she reached for the owl, she paused. “Wait. There’s no price tag on this thing.” She glanced up at me, an uncertain look crossing her face. “I can't sell it if there’s no tag. Do you still want it?”\n\nA rush of relief washed over me. “I mean, I guess if it’s free…” I trailed off, not quite believing my luck. The owl toy felt heavier in my hands, almost as if it were urging me to claim it.\n\n“Yeah, take it,” she said with a shrug, swiping the other items through without a second thought. “Maybe it’ll bring you good luck or something. Just don’t let it haunt you.”\n\nI chuckled nervously, but her words sent another chill down my spine. “Thanks,” I said, feeling the weight of the owl’s gaze again as I accepted the plastic bag. I clutched it tightly, a part of me fully aware that this was not an ordinary toy.\n\nStepping outside, the biting cold air hit me, and I looked around at the bustling holiday shoppers, oblivious to the shadows creeping in the corners of my mind. The thrill of getting the owl for free mingled uneasily with the feeling of dread that still lingered.\n\nI took a deep breath, forcing myself to shake off the unsettling thoughts. I would just go home, forget about the toy, and everything would return to normal. But even as I thought it, a nagging voice whispered in the back of my mind: Nothing would ever be normal again.\n\nWhen I reached my car, I placed the bag on the passenger seat and started the engine. The familiar hum of machinery contrasted sharply with the unsettling memories swirling in my head. I had to focus. I had to get home.\n\nAs I pulled onto the road, the evening sky darkening overhead, the feeling of being watched returned, a presence at my shoulder. The air thickened, and the shadows stretched longer, warping in the headlights like living things. My grip tightened on the steering wheel, and I forced myself to concentrate on the road ahead, ignoring the way my pulse quickened with every passing moment.\n\nBut the owl’s voice lingered in my thoughts, a reminder of the choice I had made. And as the streetlights flickered above me, casting momentary shadows across the pavement, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the true journey had only just begun.\n\nMy car came to a sudden halt at the red stoplight, the engine's low rumble barely cutting through the thickening silence. A cold sweat broke out across my forehead as the owl's warning echoed in my mind: “In a flash, there’s a car crash.” The words twisted in my gut, knotting tightly as I realized the implication. Would that mean I’d get hit by a car? Was this some twisted fate sealed in the glowing eyes of that accursed toy?\n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see headlights bearing down on me, some malevolent specter ready to push me over the edge. But nothing appeared just the dim glow of taillights stretching into the night like the ghostly remnants of forgotten dreams.\n\n“Why did I take that damn toy?” I muttered, my frustration morphing into a creeping panic. What was wrong with me? A voice deep inside, the voice of reason I often ignored, screamed that I should’ve left it behind, forgotten its allure. But the way it had glimmered in the store, the warmth of its feathers under my fingers it had felt like a call to something darker, something I couldn't quite comprehend.\n\nThe light flickered back to green, snapping me from my spiraling thoughts. I pressed the gas, but unease clung to me like a damp shroud. Each stoplight felt like a countdown, a ticking clock marking the moments until something inevitable, something horrifying, happened.\n\nI tried to rationalize it. Surely, it was just a toy a creepy piece of plastic that had caught my eye in the shadowy corners of that store. Yet the memory of its unnerving gaze haunted me, its eyes so alive, so knowing, as if it were a window into a reality I dared not explore.\n\nThe road twisted ahead, dark and winding, illuminated only by the weak glow of my headlights. “It’s just a toy,” I repeated under my breath, desperately trying to convince myself. But the words fell flat, echoing in my mind like the hollow drumbeat of inevitability.\n\nSuddenly, the car in front of me slammed to a halt, its brake lights flaring bright like warning beacons. I reacted instinctively, slamming on my brakes, the tires screeching against the asphalt, each sound amplified in the suffocating silence. My heart raced as the world around me seemed to slow, reality stretching like taffy. I was seconds away from a collision, an unseen hand reaching for my fate.\n\nBut I stopped just in time, the car lurching to a halt inches from the bumper in front of me. My breath caught in my throat, the rush of adrenaline coursing through me like fire. Had I just escaped the crash foretold by that damned owl? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, but the tension in my chest remained coiled, ready to snap.\n\nI glanced at the owl toy, still sitting innocently in the passenger seat, and a cold realization settled over me like a winter’s fog. I wasn’t merely an observer in this unfolding story I was its unwilling protagonist, and the plot was thickening, tightening around me like a noose.\n\nThe light turned green again, dragging me back to reality. I eased back into the flow of traffic, but my mind raced with questions. What was I supposed to do now? Could I escape the darkness that seemed to beckon me, or was I already ensnared in its grasp? With every passing car and flickering streetlight, the weight of my choices bore down on me, pulling me deeper into the shadows that lurked just beyond the edge of my vision.\n\nAs the night stretched on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was coming was just around the corner, waiting patiently in the darkness for me to cross its path.\n\nThe impact was a thunderclap, sharp and merciless. One second, the road stretched ahead, empty and dark. The next, it was filled with the blinding flash of headlights and the deafening crunch of metal twisting like it was nothing more than aluminum foil. My body lurched forward, chest smashing into the steering wheel with a force that felt like a sledgehammer. The windshield spiderwebbed, shards of glass exploding into the air like a million tiny daggers. I barely registered the screech of tires, the sickening jolt as my car spun out of control, before everything went black.\n\nAnd then, silence.\n\nA deep, all-consuming silence that seemed to stretch on forever. Somewhere in the distance, I thought I could hear the faint hoot of an owl, low and taunting, but it slipped away as quickly as it came. My mind felt like it was sinking into some bottomless void, detached, floating.\n\nThen came the beeping.\n\nSlow at first, then steady, a rhythmic pulse pulling me back, dragging me out of the dark. My eyelids fluttered, the world coming back into focus piece by piece. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, sterile and cold. My mouth was dry, a dull ache spreading across my chest like I'd been hit by a truck. I blinked, trying to shake off the fog clouding my thoughts.\n\nBeep... beep... beep...\n\nA heart monitor. That was the sound. It was close, too close, tethering me to reality, reminding me I was still alive. The scent of antiseptic filled my nostrils, and I felt the stiff sheets of the hospital bed beneath me.\n\nI shifted my head slightly, and that’s when I saw it. Sitting across from me on the dresser, under the harsh fluorescent glow, was the owl toy. The same one from the store. Its glassy eyes glinted in the light, watching me, unblinking. My chest tightened at the sight of it, a knot of dread curling in my gut.\n\n\"You're awake,\" a voice said, cutting through the haze. I turned my head slowly to see a police officer standing at the foot of the bed. He was a big guy, late forties maybe, with a thick mustache and tired eyes. His uniform was neatly pressed, but there was something heavy in his gaze, something that told me he’d seen too many nights like this.\n\n“How are you feeling?” he asked, pulling a chair up to my bedside.\n\nI tried to speak, but my throat felt like sandpaper. I managed a rasp. “What happened?”\n\n“You were in a car accident,” the cop said, settling into the chair. “You were hit at an intersection. Head-on collision. Driver ran a red light. You’re lucky to be alive.”\n\nI swallowed hard, the memories of the crash flooding back in fragments blinding lights, the horrible screech of metal. “And the other driver?”\n\nThe officer sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “The other driver’s in bad shape. Concussion, broken ribs, a punctured lung. They’re still in surgery.” He paused, as if weighing his words carefully. “Look, we need to get your statement. Do you remember anything about the crash? Any details?”\n\nI closed my eyes for a second, trying to piece it together, but all I could remember was the flash of headlights, the owl’s warning echoing in my ears, and then... nothing. “It all happened so fast,” I muttered. “I don’t remember much.”\n\nThe cop nodded. “It happens. Traumatic events like this, the brain has a way of protecting itself.” He shifted slightly, leaning forward. “Do you want to press charges? Given the circumstances, you'd have grounds. We can file the paperwork.”\n\nMy first instinct was to say yes. Hell yes. The driver nearly killed me. But deep down, something held me back. I felt it in the pit of my stomach a nagging sense of guilt. I’d been distracted. The owl, the warning... it had rattled me, pulled me out of focus, and I hadn’t been paying attention like I should’ve. If I’d been more aware, maybe I could’ve reacted in time, maybe I could’ve avoided the whole damn thing.\n\nI shook my head, my voice barely above a whisper. “No. No charges.”\n\nThe officer raised an eyebrow. “You sure?”\n\n[part 2 ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Storyworld\/s\/v68mnTED2v)"},"406":{"title":"What creepypasta story should I write about?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fihkz6\/what_creepypasta_story_should_i_write_about\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Beautiful_Deer307","selftext":"Hello, I'm somewhat new and curious to know what your phobia is, I love writing story but have no inspiration at the moment"},"407":{"title":"Office\/office guy creepypasta recommendations ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fimt7e\/officeoffice_guy_creepypasta_recommendations\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Main-Faithlessness50","selftext":"Can you recommend creepypasta about an office guy?

The smell of that room still haunts me—like damp earth mixed with something sharp and unclean, like moldy paper and grave dirt. It clung to me even after I was scrubbed clean. Being in there felt like stepping into a nightmare that was all too real.*\n\nIt started this morning. I was informed that I’d be participating in another \"test.\" I should have been able to get used to this by now, but every time I hear the term, I feel that familiar pit in my stomach. They lead me down the sterile hallways, the white lights flickering above like a malfunctioning heartbeat, until I reached the door of SCP-049’s containment chamber. Just looking at it sent a shiver racing down my spine—a solid, reinforced slab of steel, primal and foreboding.\n\nWhen the door opened, I almost turned and ran. It wasn’t the Dr. 049 I was afraid of; it was the dread that seeped into the very air I breathed. He was standing there, stock-still, his beaked mask as permanently affixed to his face as the smile sewn into the skin of the Joker’s smile. I could barely move as they shoved me inside, the door slamming shut behind me with a heavy, echoing clang that rattled my bones.\n\n“Ah, a visitor!” he croaked, his voice a grating whisper that seemed to resonate in the empty space.\n\nSCP-049 is terrifying. It’s not just the mask or the ancient clothing that seems to hang off his frame like the tattered remains of a centuries-old funeral garment. No, it’s the absolute certainty in his demeanor—the way he gazes at you as though he sees through to your very soul. I could almost feel him poking around in my mind, sifting through the remnants of my thoughts like a butcher examining meat.\n\nAt first, there was only silence. We stood there, him and me, like statues frozen in time. And then he approached. He walked slowly, deliberately, every footfall a quiet thunder against the concrete floor. I wrote down some of our dialogue, but it was hard to keep my thoughts organized; the fear made my head swim.\n\n“I can sense it, you know,” he said, his tone condescending yet urgent. “The affliction that plagues humanity. The inescapable rot that festers within.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “What rot?”\n\nHe leaned closer, his beak inches from my face. “The mortality you shroud yourself in. But fear not! I am a doctor, sworn to cure! To liberate you from the chains of disease and death!”\n\nThere was something manic in his eyes then. They weren’t just filled with madness; they were filled with an obsession, a fervor that made my skin crawl. I felt an overwhelming urge to recoil from him, but his presence was suffocating, wrapping around me like a smothering blanket of dread.\n\nSuddenly, he reached into the depths of his robes and pulled out a small, rusty scalpel. My heart stopped; I couldn’t take my eyes off it. “This is the tool of salvation,” he proclaimed, holding it up for me to see. “Only through sacrifice can we stride towards true health.”\n\nI shook my head instinctively. “I don’t want anything from you!” I shouted, desperation twisting my voice.\n\n“Do you not wish to be free?” he asked, almost hurt. “Your kind is so consumed by fear, yet I offer you the gift of rebirth. All you must do is trust.”\n\nI can’t help but wonder what that means. Trust him? Each word felt like a drop of poison, seeping into my veins. In that moment, the full weight of the awful truth crashed down on me: he was dead serious. He believed he was saving me, yet every instinct in my body screamed that salvation for him meant something else entirely.\n\nHow long I spent in that sterile room with him, I don’t know. Time felt like a mercurial thing, slipping through my fingers as I stood caught between terror and his sickening allure.\n\nFinally, a guard interrupted us, yanking the heavy door open and pulling me back into the light. I stumbled into the hallway, my heart pounding frantically, and the metallic tang of fear still hanging in the back of my throat.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever be the same after that—knowing there’s a creature out there that views death as merely another step towards some idealized existence. I can still feel his presence lurking behind my thoughts, whispering visions of despair and decay.\n\nWhat terrifies me most is that a part of me almost… almost believed him.\n\nI’m shaking as I close this entry. I don’t know how much longer I can endure this. Just thinking about another encounter with SCP-049 chills me to the bone.

A shape moving into my kitchen like it was afraid of the fact I saw it. Always I go to the kitchen to see if it's still there in the dark or not. I'm always too slow to catch up to it. By the time I reach the kitchen it's always gone. By the time the shape sees light it's gone. Ducking behind the wall that covers the kitchen like if a neighbor got caught looking at your yard through his hedges. No matter what I try it always hides before I can reach it and curiosity slowly consumes me by the passing nights when I do see the shape. I can't really make out what it is or what shape it is. Circular or rectangular. What is it? What can it be? I've gotten so used to whatever this thing is that at this point I want to find out what it is! More specifically how it looks. Sometimes I even see it in the corners of my eyes at night no matter when the lights are on or off. Again it flees and flees from my vision. This has to be a sign that I must catch and see what this thing finally is. So unlike the nights before I came up with a plan. I'll be completely in the dark to do this. No hallway lights to assist me or scare off this thing. So I turned off the lights, lay against the wall, and waited. And waited. I got so quiet that I was practically in the darkness. Not a soul living or not could notice I was in the darkness. I then had the feeling that now is the right time to confront this thing so I can finally discover what it is. Or even to finally have a good look at it. **I jumped out of the way dashing into the kitchen HELL I EVEN NOTICED IT GOING INTO THE DARKNESS** and... quietness prospered but the sound of my quick heartbeat was the only thing that was playing throughout the house. In the dark I noticed that I can no longer see the kitchen like I was usually able to do. I have finally caught this thing **CORNERED IT EVEN!**  But then I realized I may have asked for too much. I've gotten what I've wanted but... it was a mistake. I finally got a glimpse of this... this thing! Oh god! I regretted even thinking of seeing it! **OH GOD! WHAT WAS I THINKING?!

Little did the villagers know that this night would forever alter their reality.\n\n\n\nIt all started with an ordinary egg—or so it seemed. This egg had an unnerving trait: it smoked cigarettes. No one could explain how it came to be. Early reports claimed that the egg, as if guided by a ghostly hand, would consume cigarettes, and smoke would seep out through its tiny cracks.\n\n\n\nAt first, the villagers were intrigued. But fascination quickly turned to fear. It became clear that the egg’s smoking habit was not just peculiar but perilous. A man named Karl Zeigler was found dead near the egg, suffocated by the dense cigarette smoke emanating from it. The villagers were baffled and began to suspect that the egg harbored a dark power.\n\n\n\nThe legend says that the smoking egg was created by a secretive brotherhood, once led by a dangerous leader known as the Alpha. This leader was a self-proclaimed master of occult arts who crafted the egg as part of a ritual designed to breach the boundary between life and death. With the Alpha’s demise, the ritual was abandoned, and the egg fell into obscurity—until it reappeared in the village.\n\n\n\nAttempts to destroy the egg were futile. It seemed impervious to any form of damage; even when struck with hammers, the cigarette smoke only grew more intense. Desperate, the villagers decided to bury it. Yet, mysteriously, it always reappeared—somewhere new, always with the same noxious smoke polluting the air.\n\n\n\nThe story reached a journalist, who set out to unravel the mystery. After weeks of investigation, he uncovered ancient records about the brotherhood’s secret ceremonies and the role of the Alpha. It turned out that the Alpha had created the egg to capture the souls of the unwary who ventured too close. The cigarettes symbolized eternal damnation, while the smoke served as a prison for their souls.\n\n\n\nBut the truth came too late. The journalist was never seen again. All that remained were an empty pack of cigarettes and a note that read: “The egg’s smoke has claimed me.” The village was once more haunted by a new terror—a terror that was beyond this world.\n\n\n\nCallala, the smoking egg, is now a ghostly part of village lore. It is said to still lurk in the shadows, and anyone who dares to seek it out or attempt to destroy it is doomed to a grisly fate. Villagers whisper that the cigarette smoke still drifts through the night, an eternal reminder of the Alpha and his dark, malevolent arts.\n\n\n\nFor Callala is not merely an egg—it is a monument of evil, its origins rooted in a true and horrifying tale that remains only partially unraveled.\n\n  \nOnly known picture of callala: [https:\/\/ibb.co\/179KXRv](https:\/\/ibb.co\/179KXRv)"},"411":{"title":"The Walker in the Fields  |  Written by Morilix07","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fisyld\/the_walker_in_the_fields_written_by_morilix07\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Morilix07","selftext":"It was a quiet, cold, windy night in the cornfield I was in with my dog. My father told me to search through the somewhat small yet vast cornfield. My father was always scared of people that weren’t us in his field. We both grew up hearing stories of our family members encountering unexplainable shit in forests, old buildings, and that very cornfield my father sent me to search. I remember how my father used to tell me experiences he had in that field. Like seeing the stalks move on their own when the night was still and hearing sounds of animals like coyotes far or even close to him. Yet he’s with me sharing the story. I always take my dog with me because he’s able to sense something wrong from afar. There were some close calls several times in my life all could have turned bad but never had thanks to my dog. I quite literally owe my life to him. I then noticed the wind suddenly stopping. It was a still night once again. It was my time to search the field on a still night.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI walked onto the dry dirt. My dog silently followed. I walked to the field. Looked so small yet through the stalks so vast. I paused inches before entering the field. My dog too and he looked up at me wondering why we were still. This gave me reassurance as he did not know what I needed to know. I then entered the field in the near darkness of sunset. As soon as I started roaming around in the field the sun was gone and moonlight began to shine throughout the place. My flashlight was very dim as it was pretty old. Still my dog walked with me with no issue. I was getting pretty close to the tree line when a memory came up to me. Long ago my mother warned me to not check a certain section of the corn field. This part of the corn field was on the far left side. It was a spot that led to the forest that was next to the field. I remember seeing it only once and that one time was enough for me. There was a clearing with a small yet huge wooden house. It was abandoned for a very long time as my father remembered it always being abandoned. I remember seeing the building’s roof through the corn and hearing its many creaking sounds. Something always felt wrong about that house. It just emitted a very bad feeling. Anyways as I got closer to that side of the field I noticed my dog looking around more and treading carefully. He does that whenever he knows the presence of small critters like rats who eat the corn. Really nothing to care about.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor a moment I felt sorta lost despite me always walking in a straight line when searching through the corn which is normal considering I’ve been walking through corn for maybe half an hour already. Then the roof of that house popped out of the corn in the near darkness. That feeling or presence returns. I all of a sudden hear some type of whimpering from some type of animal. It was my dog… I almost forgot that he was here with me after staring at the roof for a second. Just something about that building just takes away my breath and makes me stare at it. Maybe that’s my fear of it speaking to me. I take a look at my dog. He’s doing nearly the same thing as me but instead of mindlessly staring at it like how I did he was staring at it with only one thing in his mind. Fear. I immediately knew something was wrong and that feeling of safety vanished. Before I could think my dog began moving away from me slowly getting faster like something was getting close. This was unusual as my dog always stayed by my side. I instantly knew this was my call to follow my dog. As soon as I began to follow him in a sort of speed walk I heard wind between the corn. Shaking the corn in the process. I had a feeling to check if it was really wind so I put my arm up as high as I could towards the sky and above the corn while on the tips of my toes. The wind wasn’t passing through my fingers… as the wind wasn’t here today. I… was not… alone. I began running towards the direction of the end of the field. My dog started running when I wasn’t looking and yet he was too slow to keep up with me. The wind was blowing harder as the corn was shaking, tearing, and falling to the floor. I only imagined it was wind to keep myself calm so I wouldn’t panic and ultimately not have enough air in me to keep running. It was blowing harder and harder until my dog wasn’t fast enough and got engulfed by the wind. It went straight through him. The wind wasn’t interested in him in the slightest it was blowing towards ME. I repeatedly amped my pace to out run this thing. It did so too like it knew exactly what move to mimic from me. I started to get tired and started to pant. It did so too with its somewhat deep yet high pitched animalistic yet humanoid-ish sounding voice. If I could call it that. I started to see moonlight reflecting off the ground through the corn stalks. I was almost out! I’M ALMOST THERE!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI felt the great feeling of the stalks brushing against me as I exited out of the corn field. I was not looking at the front of my house anymore… I was looking at nothing but forest… I looked to my left… There was my house from afar. I BEGAN RUNNING TOWARDS IT! ALMOST THERE! ALMOST THERE! AS I HEARD THE THING MOVING IN STALKS! GOING TOWARDS ME! UNTIL… I heard the sound of my shoes on the porch. I then realized that in my fear I’ve already reached home. I opened the door and as I was about to close it my dog went inside the house as terrified as I was. Once I closed and locked the door I fell down to the floor out of breath. I looked at my dog. He looked like he was tearing up and shaking violently out of fear. He had scratches on him from the stalks but two from whatever that thing was in that field. The home was quiet and dark like the field. My parents were asleep since it was late. I stayed next to the door until I could catch my breath. My dog went to his bed now sound asleep. I got up and as I was heading back to my room I felt the need to look at the window. So I did. I pulled the curtains back, Put my head as close to the window as I can to see as much out there in the dark as I could, and seen this:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[**https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/aKcKotf**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/aKcKotf)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI stood there frozen. It stood there frozen as well. We both didn’t move for minutes. I noticed that it had its head tilted in what I think was curiosity. As we both looked at each other I noticed that it had animal-like legs and yet it still looked humanoid. This was no human nor any animal that I know of. That thing then turned its head facing to the field in an unnatural, robotic, yet animalistic motion like it had noticed something in said field while tilting its head back to its normal position. It went back into the field unnaturally. I still stood there in complete shock at what I just witnessed.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI then put the pieces together with what I encountered. I believe what I encountered that night was a Skinwalker. No doubt about it. I never told my family members or anyone about this until now. 7 years have passed since that day. I was 14 when I saw that thing and it has since been quiet around here. However I have the feeling like it’s been too quiet as of late. A thought that I’ve been dreading is now lingering in my head. I or someone else might be the unfortunate next one to encounter it. I have a feeling that the next time won’t be so pleasant compared to what I experienced. The only thing I can really do at this point is to pray to god that the next time won’t be the final time. I can only pray.\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLicense: Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike This story is copyrighted by Morilix07 as Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA.\n\n\n\nAbout this License You can remix or tweak this story for non-commercial purposes as long as you credit the author and license your new creation under identical terms.

Every word is a struggle. What I witnessed today, I can barely grasp. The fear is still echoing in my mind like a twisted ghost that won’t leave me alone. But I need to get this down. Maybe it’ll save someone else. Maybe it’ll keep my sanity intact.\n\nI was selected for a routine test… or that’s what they told me. The usual preamble—“You’ll be fine, just go in, observe, and report back.” Like they had no idea what I was about to face. But I did. This time was different. I was put in a room with SCP-035, that godforsaken mask. I’ve heard the rumors, the whispered warnings amongst the other D-Class inmates. It’s a mask that consumes minds, that twists thoughts, that… that **possesses**.\n\nThey locked me inside with it while the guards monitored from behind the one-way glass. My pulse was hammering in my chest as they set the mask on the table, its porcelain surface gleaming in the fluorescent lights. It was just a mask, I told myself. Just a piece of art, an object. But as I looked into its hollow eyes, it felt like it was looking back at me, drinking in every ounce of fear and dread that radiated from my body.\n\nFor the first few minutes, nothing happened. It sat there in eerie silence, and I started to think maybe the rumors were just hype. But then it spoke. The voice was smooth, almost seductive, creeping into my ears like smoke. “Why do you resist?” It asked, every word laced with a persuasive charm that sent chills down my spine. “I can free you from this wretched life. I can give you power, purpose. You could be more than just a D-Class.”\n\nI shivered, shaking my head. “No… no way. I’m not falling for that.” But a part of me, a dark, succulent part, hungered for what it promised. I felt it clawing at the edges of my mind, whispering sweet nothings that curled around my thoughts like a serpent. “You could be someone important. They don’t care about you. You’re disposable to them.”\n\nThe longer I sat there, the more I felt my resolve unravel. The lights above flickered, and beneath the mask, its expression shifted—a grotesque grin splitting its painted face. It was alive. I could see it moving, its demeanor changing with each passing moment.\n\n“Look at me,” it urged, almost tenderly. “You see a mask, but I am a door. A door to a new life, one where your will is unchained.” I fought back against the sensations it invoked—temptation, regret, anger. But it was a losing battle. I could hear voices, my own, ripping through the facade of my sanity. “Give in…” they whispered. “It’s so easy.”\n\nThe air thickened with tension, suffocating me as I battled for control. The words of the mask twisted into a cacophony that made my skin crawl. I didn’t want to be here. I needed to escape. But… what would they do if I tried? I didn’t have anything to lose except my own mind.\n\nThen I felt it—a wave of darkness surged through me. I was slipping. The mask’s grin widened, and I could see myself reflected in its eyes, writhing with despair, screaming silently. I was no longer just a D-Class; I was prey.\n\n“Come closer,” it beckoned, voice dripping with malice. “Embrace your true self.”\n\nThat was it. I couldn’t take it anymore. I lunged for the door, pounding on the steel with a frantic desperation. My thoughts were splintering, feeling the weight of the mask’s influence pressing down on me like a physical force. “Let me out! PLEASE!”\n\nMoments later, the door flew open, and armed guards stormed in, pulling me away from the mask as if I were a rabid dog. I was shaking uncontrollably. I heard their voices, but they were muffled, distant. I wasn’t sure who I was anymore—just a collection of fragments barely clinging to reality.\n\nAs I was dragged out into the sterile hallway, I looked back. SCP-035 was still there, its smile etched into the mask, alive with a darkness that knew my name. I could still hear it whispering as I was pulled further away. I could feel my thoughts trembling on the edge, the fear still spiraling within me.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever be the same after this. I don’t know if I can sleep without seeing that mask, without hearing its promises echo in the silence. God, I hope you never have to face it.\n\nI’m not sure if it really is just a mask. Maybe, deep down, it’s something much worse."},"413":{"title":"My encounter with The Rake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fiquce\/my_encounter_with_the_rake\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Beautiful_Deer307","selftext":"It was just past midnight when I first noticed the creeping shadows lurking in the corners of my room. I had always been a skeptic, dismissing tales of the paranormal and the grotesque. To me, they were just stories told around campfires or whispered at sleepovers—fections of wild imaginations fueled by too much sugar and not enough sleep. But that night, sitting cross-legged on my bed with my laptop illuminating the dimness of my cramped apartment, those tales began to gnaw at my rational mind.\n\nI had been online, diving into the dark corridors of the internet, browsing through forums riddled with spine-chilling stories and unsettling encounters. The Rake. The name surfaced repeatedly, each post filled with accounts of dread-inducing experiences that no one could quite explain. Skepticism bubbled in my throat; I was too logical to succumb to fear. Yet, as the clock ticked on, a small seed of trepidation took root.\n\nI set my laptop aside and tried to shake the weight of the stories from my mind. I climbed into bed, a flimsy fortress of cotton sheets and a patchwork quilt. I told myself it was just a myth and closed my eyes, attempting to lure sleep into my restless thoughts.\n\nBut it was nothing short of an unsettling feeling that pulled me from slumber hours later. My senses were heightened; I could hear the faintest creaks of settling wood and the distant hum of a streetlight outside. I pushed the quilt aside and peered into the suffocating darkness. The fleeting glow of my laptop seemed a luxurious oasis in the otherwise oppressive gloom.\n\nThen, there it was. A sound—a quiet scratching, like nails against a surface that should not make noise. I sat up, heart hammering against my ribcage, laughter bubbling in my throat. \"It’s just your imagination,\" I whispered to myself. But it didn't help. The sound grew louder, an incessant scraping accompanied by an uneasy rustling. A breath caught in my throat as I listened, intensely aware of the stillness around me. The air felt charged, thick with an unmistakable tension.\n\nShadows grew deeper in the corners of my bedroom, and a shudder crawled up my spine as I swore I saw a shape—too slender and unnatural to belong to this world—sliding just beyond the edge of my vision. I turned on my bedside lamp, the yellow glow pushing back some of the darkness, but the shadows within my room seemed to shift, transforming into something sinister.\n\nIt emerged slowly, a figure warped and gaunt, with skin stretched tight over its bones—pale, glistening in the light like an unnatural enemy found only in nightmares. Its eyes were hollow, dark voids that bore into me, and I was paralyzed. The creature moved without sound, as fluid as water yet heavy with malice. And at that moment, I understood the horror of what I was witnessing. The tales of The Rake darted through my mind, inescapable memories of stories and warnings from the forums.\n\nI couldn't look away, frozen under that penetrating gaze. It approached, each movement deliberate, its limbs impossibly long, ending in fingers as pointed and sharp as shards of glass. I gripped the quilt tightly, my nails digging into the fabric as I stifled a scream. I was caught between disbelief and terror, my mind racing as I tried to fathom how this was happening, how the stories had leapt from fiction to reality.\n\nWith each passing moment, I felt the cold grip of despair wrap around me. The Rake was only inches from my bed—a grotesque amalgamation of my darkest fears and the twisted stories I had once mocked. A raspy breath escaped its lips, a sound so chilling that it reverberated through my bones.\n\nIn that second, I remembered what the stories always said: that it always comes closer, always draws nearer, feeding off your fear. I tried to muster courage, to shout, to summon any ounce of fight. But the only response that emerged from my throat was a pathetic whimper.\n\nSuddenly, it leaned in closer, the grotesque visage inches from mine. I thought I could smell the rot, decay mingling with the acrid scent of despair. It took a long, slow breath, as though savoring the moment. Just as a scream threatened to escape my lips, I felt a rush of wind—a sensation as if a door in the back of my mind had been thrown wide open.\n\nAnd in an instant, it was gone.\n\nI sat there, trembling, light flickering violently. The shadows slinked back into their corners, but the weight—the dread—remained thick in the air. I stared into the abyss where it had been, knowing deep down the stories were not merely fables spun from fantasy.\n\nI trembled under the sheets, gasping for breath, realizing that I would never sleep soundly again, forever haunted by that harrowing encounter with The Rake. What would I do if it came back? I could only wait, question my sanity, and hope the stories would remain just that—stories. But deep within me, a gnawing knowledge lingered: I had invited a nightmare into my life. And nightmares often come when you least expect them."},"414":{"title":"noescape.jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fij1wt\/noescapejpeg\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"sunicthehooxchoog","selftext":"Note: I tried to write a classic mystery creepypasta simmilar to smile dog\n\nBack in the late 2006 there was a strange image shared on 4chan called \"noescape.jpeg\" apparently it contained 4 men in straight jackets sitting in a room with brick walls, they were smiling but it looked forced.

Dishes piled high, clothes I hadn't bothered to pick up in weeks, and newspapers cluttered the floor like a layer of dust on my past. Everything about this place felt dead, as lifeless as I felt inside. It's been ten years since my parents died, but some days, it feels like it was just yesterday. Other days, like tonight, it feels like they've been gone forever. I stopped believing in anything after they passed. Faith, hope, God—none of it meant anything to me anymore.\n\nBut old habits die hard. I found myself sitting on the edge of my bed, hands clasped together like I used to when I was a kid, reciting half-remembered prayers. My words were hollow, slipping from my lips without meaning. I didn't believe anyone was listening. Why would they? I hadn't been to church in years and hadn't even thought about God in any real sense since I watched them lower my parents into the ground. But here I was, whispering prayers into the void, feeling stupid for even going through the motions.\n\nThe silence in the room felt suffocating. I let out a heavy sigh and ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back as I leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees. What was the point of all this? Every day felt like it bled into the next, an endless loop of nothingness. My friends had long since drifted away, and I couldn't blame them. I barely left the apartment anymore. Maybe they got tired of trying to pull me out of this pit when all I did was pull them in with me.\n\nIt was in the middle of that silence, that heavy, crushing stillness, that I heard it.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination—a voice, soft but clear, cutting through the haze in my mind. I sat up straighter, my heart pounding for reasons I couldn't explain.\n\n\"Jude,\" the voice said, smooth and comforting. \"Jude, I've been watching you.\"\n\nI froze, my mind racing. Was I hearing things? The voice was calm, almost soothing like it was speaking directly into my thoughts.\n\n\"Who...?\" I whispered, my voice cracking from disuse. My heart thudded against my ribs, the pulse-quickening as the voice continued.\n\n\"I am God,\" it said simply as if that explained everything. \"And I have chosen you.\"\n\nA cold shiver ran down my spine. God? That's ridiculous. I hadn't believed in God in a long time. But there was something about the way the voice spoke, something that made my skin prickle with fear and... a strange sense of comfort.\n\n\"You feel lost,\" it continued, as if reading my thoughts. \"You've drifted far from your path. But I am here now. I want to help you find your way again.\"\n\nI didn't respond. What could I say to that? My brain told me this was crazy, that I was losing my mind. But there was a part of me, the part that had been drowning in loneliness and despair, that wanted to believe it was real. I wanted to believe that someone—something—had come to save me from myself.\n\nI sat there for what felt like forever, staring into the darkened corners of my apartment, waiting for something else to happen. My heart was still racing, but my body felt frozen as if I couldn't move even if I wanted to. The voice—that voice—kept echoing in my mind. \"I am God.\" It was absurd, wasn't it? I wasn't some religious zealot or a man of faith anymore. But what else could it be? It wasn't like I'd had visitors recently, and it didn't sound like the kind of voice that came from a mind cracking under pressure. It was too...calm.\n\n\"I know you're afraid,\" the voice spoke again, softer this time, almost gentle. \"But there's nothing to fear. I've come to help you, Jude.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in my throat. \"Help me?\" My voice came out quieter than I intended. I didn't want to sound desperate, but I knew I did. I felt desperate.\n\n\"Yes,\" the voice replied, as steady and comforting as before. \"You've suffered long enough. I can see the weight you carry, the burden of your loss. Let me lift it for you. All I ask is to walk with you, to live through you, and to experience what it is to be human.\"\n\nSomething about the way it said that last part made my skin crawl, but I brushed it off. I wasn't in the position to question help, no matter how strange it seemed. Living through me? Experiencing humanity? That didn't sound so bad, did it? The Catholic teachings from my childhood floated to the surface of my mind—God moving through us, guiding our actions, helping us be better. Maybe that's what this was.\n\nI felt a flicker of something I hadn't felt in years. Hope. If this was real—if it wasn't some kind of delusion—maybe this was my chance. My chance to make sense of everything that had happened, of everything I'd lost.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I asked, my voice a little stronger now.\n\n\"Only what you've already been willing to give,\" the voice said, patient. \"Your life, your experiences. I want to walk beside you, feel what you feel, and help you heal. In return, I will show you things you've never known. You'll find peace again.\"\n\nPeace. God, did I want that. The kind of peace that didn't feel like drowning in sorrow. The kind of peace that would let me sleep without waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for air with my heart pounding like I'd just been buried alive.\n\nI hesitated for only a moment longer before nodding, though I wasn't sure who I was nodding to. \"Okay,\" I whispered. \"If you're really God, and you can do what you say... I'll let you in.\"\n\nThe second the words left my mouth, I felt something—like a cool breeze slipping inside my chest, filling the hollow space that had been there for so long. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was strange. Like I could feel the presence of something...someone else inside me.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the voice said, quieter now but still soothing. \"Together, we'll do great things.\"\n\nI exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. The apartment seemed quieter now, still dark and cluttered, but there was a lightness in the air that hadn't been there before. It was subtle, barely noticeable, but it was enough to make me feel...different.\n\nI stood up, shaky at first but steadier than I'd been in weeks. Maybe months. There was a new energy coursing through me, something alive and warm. It made me feel like I could take on anything. Maybe this was what faith felt like. Maybe I was finally finding my way back to something greater than myself.\n\n\"Now,\" the voice spoke again, guiding me, \"let's begin.\"\n\nThe days that followed were the brightest I'd had in years. The voice, soft and steady, kept me going, encouraging me to make small changes in my life. At first, it was simple things—cleaning up the apartment, tossing out the piles of trash I'd let build up for months. It was amazing how different it felt, how much lighter the air seemed once the place wasn't suffocating under the weight of clutter. The more I cleaned, the more I felt like I could breathe again.\n\nI started taking better care of myself, too. The voice, always calm and reassuring, nudged me to shower more often, to eat real food instead of living off frozen meals and takeout. The act of making a sandwich felt oddly fulfilling as if I was reclaiming something I'd lost. For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually looked forward to the little things. It was as if the voice had flipped a switch inside me, lighting up the parts of me I'd buried in the darkness.\n\n\"You're doing well,\" the voice would say, that comforting tone wrapping around me like a warm blanket. \"This is the first step. You're on the right path.\"\n\nAnd I believed it. How could I not? My life was improving slowly but surely. I wasn't just sitting in that dingy apartment, staring at the walls anymore. I was living again. The voice kept me focused, kept me grounded, and I found myself trusting it more with each passing day.\n\nBut it wasn't just about cleaning and eating better. One morning, as I sipped on a cup of coffee I'd actually brewed myself instead of grabbing from the convenience store, the voice nudged me toward something bigger.\n\n\"It's time to reconnect,\" it said as if it knew exactly what was on my mind before I even thought it. \"Your friends have been waiting for you. They miss you, Jude.\"\n\nI stared at the cup in my hands, the steam swirling up in delicate patterns. My friends. I hadn't thought about them in a while, not really. Sure, I saw them maybe five times a year, but it was always awkward like we were strangers who shared old memories but nothing else. Over the years, I'd shut them out, unwilling to burden them with my misery. Yet, the voice was right. They were still there, waiting for me. Maybe now that I had \"God\" with me, things could be different.\n\n\"They're important to your journey,\" the voice continued. \"Reach out to them. Show them you're changing, that you're healing. They'll see it, and you'll help them too.\"\n\nThere it was again—that idea of helping others. The thought didn't just sit with me, it bloomed inside my chest like a seed sprouting new life. Maybe I could help them. Maybe this wasn't just about me anymore.\n\nThat afternoon, I sent out a few simple texts to the people I'd grown distant from. *Hey, it's been a while. Want to catch up sometime?*\n\nTo my surprise, they responded. Enthusiastically. Within a few days, I was sitting at a small café, sipping coffee with old friends I hadn't seen in months. At first, the conversation was light and casual—what everyone had been up to and how work was going. But as the hours wore on, we slipped into more personal territory.\n\nIt was Tom who brought it up first. He leaned back in his chair, eyes distant as he spoke about how he'd been struggling with anxiety, how it felt like the walls were closing in on him sometimes. I listened, nodding sympathetically, but I could feel the voice stirring in my mind.\n\n\"He needs to confront his pain,\" the voice whispered, soft but insistent. \"Push him. Make him face it head-on.\"\n\nI hesitated. Tom's words were heavy, filled with uncertainty, and it didn't feel right to dig into that. But the voice... it sounded so sure, so certain that this was the way. I shifted in my seat, trying to figure out how to approach it.\n\n\"You know,\" I began carefully, \"sometimes you have to face that stuff directly. I've been going through some things myself, and what's helped me is... confronting it. Really digging deep, even when it hurts.\"\n\nTom blinked at me, surprised. His expression shifted—was that discomfort?—but I pressed on, the voice urging me forward.\n\n\"Maybe you need to look at what's really causing it,\" I continued. \"Stop avoiding it. Let it hurt for a while, and then you'll come out stronger.\"\n\nHe didn't respond at first, just stared into his cup. The silence felt heavy between us like the air itself had thickened. My heart started to race—had I gone too far? Had I pushed too hard? But the voice was calm, unbothered.\n\n\"You're helping him,\" it said, soothing me. \"This is what he needs.\"\n\nTom finally looked up, his eyes dark and stormy. \"Maybe,\" he said quietly, but there was a tension in his voice, something fragile that I couldn't quite place.\n\nThe rest of the conversation was more stilted after that. We talked a little longer, but the warmth from earlier was gone. I left the café feeling uneasy as if something had shifted, but I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Still, the voice reassured me, telling me that this was how people grew—through pain, through confrontation. I convinced myself that I was helping Tom, even if it didn't feel that way at the moment.\n\nThat night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the familiar pain in my back returned. This time, it was sharper and more intense than it had been before. I groaned, shifting uncomfortably as the ache spread from my shoulders down my spine.\n\n\"Relax,\" the voice said, gentle but firm. \"This is part of the process. It's how you grow.\"\n\nI clenched my teeth as the pain intensified, a burning sensation now radiating from my shoulder blades. It felt like something was pressing against my skin from the inside, trying to break free. But even as the discomfort grew, I found myself accepting it, welcoming it. The voice was right—pain was necessary. It was how we became stronger, how we grew.\n\nAs the night wore on, the pain dulled into a throbbing ache, but I didn't fight it. I let it consume me, drifting into a restless sleep with the voice whispering softly in the back of my mind.\n\n\"This is only the beginning.\"\n\nThe next few days passed in a blur. My back still ached, but I pushed it to the back of my mind, focusing on the progress I was making. Things were... good. Or at least, they seemed that way. I was reaching out to friends more, keeping the apartment clean, and eating better. The voice kept guiding me, offering bits of advice that I followed without question.\n\nBut Tom had been quiet since our last meeting. At first, I chalked it up to him needing time to process what I'd said, but after days of radio silence, a small seed of doubt began to grow in my mind. Had I gone too far? Had I pushed him when he wasn't ready?\n\n\"You did the right thing,\" the voice reassured me. \"He needs time, that's all. Growth comes through pain, Jude. You'll see.\"\n\nI wanted to believe it. I needed to believe it. After all, the voice hadn't steered me wrong yet. My life was better because of it. So, I pushed my doubts aside and focused on the next step in my journey—reaching out to Mark, another old friend I hadn't seen in months.\n\nWe arranged to meet at a local bar, the kind of place we used to frequent back in the day before everything had fallen apart. When I walked in, Mark was already there, sitting at a corner table with a beer in hand. He smiled when he saw me, but there was something in his eyes—a flicker of hesitation, maybe. Or was it just my imagination?\n\n\"Jude,\" he said, standing up to greet me. \"It's been a while.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, forcing a smile as I shook his hand. \"Too long.\"\n\nWe made small talk for a while, catching up on the usual things—work, life, the weather. But the voice was there, in the back of my mind, waiting. It felt like it was biding its time, waiting for the right moment to step in.\n\nAnd that moment came after Mark's second beer, when he leaned in a little closer, his voice lowering as he talked about his recent breakup.\n\n\"It's been rough,\" he admitted, his eyes downcast. \"I thought she was the one, you know? But... things fell apart. It's my fault, mostly. I guess I've just got too much baggage. She couldn't deal with it anymore.\"\n\nThe voice stirred, its presence stronger now. \"He needs to face the truth, Jude,\" it whispered, insistent. \"He's hiding from himself. Make him confront it.\"\n\nI hesitated again, just like I had with Tom. But the voice's pressure was stronger this time, more urgent. It pushed me, and before I could stop myself, the words were spilling out.\n\n\"You know, maybe she left because you weren't dealing with your own problems,\" I said, my tone sharper than I'd intended. \"Maybe she saw the cracks and realized you were never going to fix them.\"\n\nMark blinked, his expression shifting from sadness to confusion. \"What?\"\n\n\"You've got to face it, Mark,\" I continued, the voice pushing me forward. \"You can't just blame it on her leaving. If you want to move on, you've got to face your own shit. Stop hiding behind the breakup like it's all on her. You're the problem, and until you deal with that, no one's ever going to stick around.\"\n\nThere was a long silence after that. Mark stared at me, his face tightening, a mix of shock and anger flashing across his features. I could feel my heart racing and the blood pounding in my ears. Had I gone too far again? Had I pushed him like I had with Tom? But the voice kept whispering, reassuring me.\n\n\"This is for his own good, Jude. You're helping him grow. Pain leads to understanding.\"\n\n\"I—I didn't mean it like that,\" Mark stammered, his voice shaky. \"I... I don't know. Maybe you're right, but...\"\n\nHis words trailed off, and he looked away, his jaw clenched. I knew I'd hit a nerve, but instead of feeling guilty, I felt something else—a sense of satisfaction. The voice was right. This was how people grew. By facing their pain head-on.\n\nThe rest of the night was awkward. We didn't talk much after that; we just exchanged a few strained words before Mark made an excuse to leave early. I watched him walk out of the bar, the weight of the moment pressing down on me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had done the right thing.\n\nI sat there alone for a while, sipping my beer and replaying the conversation in my head. The more I thought about it, the more I convinced myself that I had helped him, just like I'd helped Tom. It didn't matter that they both seemed uncomfortable, even hurt by my words. Growth was painful. That's what the voice kept telling me, and I believed it.\n\nAs I walked home that night, the pain in my back flared up again, sharper this time. I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, wincing as the burning sensation spread across my shoulders. It felt like something was moving beneath my skin, pushing against it, trying to break free. I stumbled, clutching at my back as the pain intensified, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps.\n\n\"Breathe, Jude,\" the voice whispered, calm and patient. \"This is part of your transformation. You're becoming something more. Embrace the pain.\"\n\nI stood there, hunched over in the cold night air, gritting my teeth as the agony ripped through me. But I didn't fight it. I couldn't. If this was what it took to fulfill my purpose, to help others grow, then I would endure it. I would let the pain shape me, just like the voice had promised.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the pain dulled, leaving a throbbing ache in its wake. I straightened up slowly, my body trembling, and continued walking home. By the time I reached my apartment, I was drenched in sweat, my legs barely able to carry me to my bed.\n\nAs I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the voice hummed softly in my mind, soothing me, calming me.\n\n\"You're on the right path,\" it said. \"Soon, you'll understand everything. This is just the beginning.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, my body still aching, but I felt something else now—something deeper. A sense of purpose. Of destiny.\n\nWhatever was happening to me, I was ready for it.\n\nI texted Mark again, asking if he wanted to meet up. The first few texts went unanswered, but I kept pushing. After what happened last time, I understood why he might not be too eager to see me. I told him I wanted to apologize and that I just wanted to talk things through and make things right. After a long wait, he finally agreed.\n\nWe planned to meet at my apartment this time. Something about the isolation of it felt right. The voice told me it was better this way—no distractions, no interruptions. We could really get into what was holding him back, and I could help him grow.\n\nThe day came, and Mark showed up looking uneasy, fidgeting with his jacket zipper as he stood in my doorway. I tried to smile, to put him at ease, but there was a nervous energy between us that made my skin prickle. Still, I invited him in, and he hesitantly stepped over the threshold.\n\nThe apartment was clean now, almost unrecognizable compared to the mess it had been before. Mark glanced around, visibly surprised at the change. \"You've been busy,\" he commented, his voice strained with forced casualness.\n\n\"Yeah, I've been making some changes,\" I said, keeping my tone light. \"Trying to improve, you know? Just like I want to help you do.\"\n\nMark's eyes flickered with something—worry, maybe—but he nodded and sat down on the couch. I could see how tense he was, the way his shoulders were hunched forward as if he was bracing himself for something.\n\nWe made small talk for a bit, just like we did at the bar last time, but I wasn't interested in the surface-level stuff anymore. The voice was there, whispering in the back of my mind, urging me forward. It was time to help Mark break through his walls.\n\n\"You've been struggling,\" I said, cutting off the light conversation. \"Since the breakup. I know you're trying to move on, but you haven't really faced the real problem, have you?\"\n\nMark stiffened. His eyes darkened, his lips pressing together into a thin line. \"I... I don't want to get into all that again, Jude,\" he muttered. \"Not like last time.\"\n\nBut the voice pushed harder, louder now, drowning out any second thoughts I might've had. \"He needs to feel it, Jude. He needs to suffer if he's ever going to grow.\"\n\nI leaned forward, my hands clasped together as I stared at him, my gaze unwavering. \"You're never going to get past this if you keep running from it,\" I said, my voice firm. \"You need to face the pain, Mark. You need to feel it, deep down, or you'll never heal.\"\n\nMark shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting toward the door. \"I... I don't think this is a good idea.\"\n\nBefore he could move, before he could stand up to leave, the voice gave a final command. \"Show him. Make him feel it.\"\n\nMy hand shot out and grabbed his arm, gripping it tightly. Mark froze, his eyes widening in shock. \"Jude, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"You need to feel it,\" I repeated, my voice steady but my grip tightening. \"This is the only way. You can't keep running from the pain.\"\n\nI twisted his arm behind his back, forcing him to his knees as he yelped in pain. My heart raced, but the voice was there, soothing me, telling me this was right. This was how I was supposed to help him.\n\n\"Jude, stop!\" Mark gasped, struggling against me, but I held him firm, pushing him down harder. His body twisted under the pressure, his breath coming in ragged gasps as I forced him to the ground.\n\nThe voice was relentless now, filling my mind with its commands. \"Make him suffer. Only then will he understand.\"\n\nMy free hand reached for his throat, pressing down as his eyes filled with terror. His hands clawed at my wrists, trying to pry me off, but I didn't let go. I pressed harder, feeling his pulse quicken beneath my fingers.\n\n\"This is for your own good,\" I whispered, my voice trembling with some twisted form of reassurance. \"You'll thank me for this.\"\n\nMark's face twisted in agony, his body writhing as he struggled to breathe. His gasps turned into choked sobs, and I felt something inside me shift, something dark and violent taking root. The voice hummed in satisfaction, feeding on the pain I was inflicting.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, it wasn't just Mark who was suffering. A sharp, searing pain erupted in my back, so intense that I staggered, releasing him. My hands flew to my shoulders as the pain spread, tearing through me like a wildfire. I collapsed to my knees, gasping as the burning sensation reached its peak.\n\nMark scrambled away, coughing and choking as he stumbled to his feet. I barely noticed him flee, my mind consumed by the agony ripping through my body. I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pushing, stretching, breaking free.\n\nThe pain became unbearable, and I screamed, my voice raw and animalistic. My shoulders were on fire, my flesh tearing as something sharp began to poke through the skin. Blood soaked through my shirt, and I ripped it off, desperate to see what was happening.\n\nMy back was a mess of torn skin and blood, but beneath the gore, I saw them—two jagged, bony spikes protruding from my shoulder blades. They were growing, pushing their way out of me with sickening cracks and pops, stretching upward like twisted, blood-soaked wings.\n\nThe pain was unimaginable, but through it all, I felt... elated. The voice was there, soothing me, telling me that this was my transformation, my reward for doing \"God's\" work.\n\n\"You're becoming something more,\" it whispered. \"This is your destiny. Embrace it.\"\n\nI collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling, blood pooling beneath me. My vision blurred, the edges of the room darkening as I fought to stay conscious. But even as the darkness closed in, I couldn't help but smile.\n\nI had done it. I had helped Mark, just like I was meant to. And now, I was becoming something greater—something divine.\n\nAs I slipped into unconsciousness, the last thing I heard was the voice, calm and reassuring.\n\n\"You've done well, Jude. You're almost ready.\"\n\nThe voice had grown louder and more demanding over the past few days. It wasn't satisfied with the small acts of pain I'd inflicted. I'd pushed Mark and Tom, I'd made them suffer, but it wasn't enough. The voice told me they were only steps on a path, a necessary part of my transformation, but there was more—something bigger, something I wasn't yet ready to see.\n\nThat night, the voice called to me with a new urgency.\n\n\"Now is the time, Jude,\" it whispered, its tone colder than before. \"You've prepared yourself for this moment. You must bring suffering to the world. Only then will you truly become what I need you to be.\"\n\nI didn't question it. How could I? Everything the voice had told me up to this point had been right. I had seen the changes in myself, the transformation happening before my eyes—before my *soul*. The spikes in my back were proof that I was becoming something more than human. The pain, the agony I endured, it was all part of the process.\n\nBut this time, the voice wasn't asking for words or emotional suffering. This time, it wanted something real. Something irreversible.\n\n\"Go out tonight,\" it commanded. \"Find someone. A soul that needs to feel my presence. Bring them pain, Jude. Bring them to me.\"\n\nI didn't ask why. I didn't hesitate. I simply did as I was told.\n\nI left my apartment without a second thought, the cool night air hitting my skin as I stepped into the darkness. The city was quieter than usual. Empty streets stretched before me, illuminated by pale streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. I felt a strange sense of calm as I walked as if I knew exactly what I needed to do.\n\nThe voice guided me, tugging at my mind, pulling me toward the quiet alleys and backstreets. I walked for what felt like hours, my body moving on autopilot until I saw her. She was standing by herself, waiting at a bus stop. A middle-aged woman dressed in a dark coat looking down at her phone. She was alone. Vulnerable.\n\n\"This is her, Jude,\" the voice said, its presence now overpowering. \"She's the one. Her soul is ready. You must help her. Bring her pain, bring her closer to me.\"\n\nI felt my heart racing, not with fear, but with anticipation. My hands twitched as I approached her, my footsteps barely making a sound on the cracked sidewalk. She didn't notice me until I was right behind her.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I said, my voice steady, almost friendly.\n\nShe turned around, startled. I could see the confusion on her face as she took a step back, her eyes flicking to the empty street around us. \"Can I help you?\" she asked, her voice shaking slightly.\n\n\"You need to feel this,\" I whispered, taking a step closer.\n\nHer face contorted with fear, and she tried to back away, but I was faster. My hands reached out and grabbed her throat, squeezing tight before she could even scream. The shock in her eyes quickly turned to panic as she clawed at my arms, struggling to pull free.\n\n\"Shh,\" I whispered, tightening my grip. \"This is for you. You need to feel the pain. It's the only way to get closer to Him.\"\n\nHer gasps filled the air, her body thrashing as she tried to fight me off, but I held her down, pressing her into the ground, the cold pavement beneath us. My grip tightened even more, my fingers digging into her skin as her struggles became weaker, her eyes wide with terror. I felt no remorse, no guilt. This was the right thing to do. She needed this. I was giving her a gift.\n\nHer body stopped moving after a while, the last breath escaping her lips in a faint, broken sound. I held on for a moment longer, waiting until the life drained from her eyes. When I finally let go, her body fell limp against the pavement.\n\nI stood there, breathing heavily, my hands trembling as I looked down at her lifeless form. A strange sense of satisfaction washed over me. The voice had been right. This was necessary. I had done what was asked of me, and now... now I would finally receive my reward.\n\nAnd then, the pain hit.\n\nIt was unlike anything I had ever felt before. A burning, searing agony exploded in my back, sharper than the spikes that had emerged before. I screamed, my body convulsing as I fell to my knees beside her corpse. My hands clawed at my back, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. The pain grew worse, spreading from my shoulders down to my spine as if my entire body was being torn apart from the inside.\n\nAnd then I felt them—something large, heavy, and wet pushing through the torn skin of my back. The spikes, the ones that had been there for days, began to stretch and grow, tearing through the flesh with a sickening crack. Blood poured from the wounds, staining the pavement beneath me as the spikes unfurled.\n\nI gasped, my breath catching in my throat as I felt them grow—long, jagged, blood-soaked wings erupting from my back. They spread wide, casting dark shadows in the dim light of the streetlamp, each movement sending waves of pain through my body. I could feel the blood dripping down my sides, pooling beneath me as the wings twitched and flexed, heavy and sharp.\n\nBut through all the pain, I felt... alive. I looked up at the sky, my body trembling as I knelt in the pool of blood, her lifeless body beside me. The wings beat once, twice, heavy and strong, sending gusts of air around me.\n\n\"You've done it,\" the voice said, soft but triumphant. \"You've brought her to me. You've embraced your destiny, Jude. This is what you were meant to become.\"\n\nThe pain was unbearable, but it didn't matter. I had become something more—something divine. I had fulfilled my purpose. The wings, though grotesque and soaked in blood, felt like the final piece of my transformation.\n\nI had killed for God. And in return, He had given me this.\n\nAs I knelt there, the blood still seeping from my wounds, I felt a strange peace settle over me. This was what I was meant to do. This was who I was meant to be.\n\nI woke up in the hospital, strapped to machines, barely able to move. At first, I thought it was a dream—one of those nightmares where you can't scream, can't even open your eyes. But it wasn't a dream. This was real. I couldn't move, couldn't feel anything from the neck down.\n\nThey told me I had been found in the middle of the street, covered in blood, barely alive. The police thought I was the victim of some random attack. They said it was a miracle I'd survived at all. The woman—*the woman I killed*—they said she hadn't been so lucky. They told me they'd found her body next to mine, beaten, strangled. But they never suspected me. Not once. They said someone must've attacked us both, that I'd somehow made it out alive while she didn't.\n\nIt's strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved that I wasn't caught. But all I could feel was… devastation.\n\nI had failed Him.\n\nThe wings—*my wings*—were gone. When I came to that hospital bed, paralyzed and broken, there was nothing left. No evidence of the transformation I had undergone. No proof of the divine being I was becoming. I had blacked out after my wings emerged, and now they were gone as if they had never been there at all.\n\nAnd that… that is what haunts me the most.\n\nI didn't get to finish the work. I didn't get to bring the world closer to Him, to help them understand the beauty of suffering, the purity of pain. When I lost consciousness, I must have disappointed Him. I failed God at the moment when He needed me most.\n\nNow I lie here, in this bed, day after day. Paralyzed. Bedridden. Useless. They gave me this device to help me communicate and to speak my thoughts aloud so I could share my story. But what good is it now? What good am I now?\n\nStill… even in this broken body, I feel something. A kind of peace. Yes, I failed Him in the end, but I was chosen. *I was chosen* to let Him experience life through me. And for that, I am grateful.\n\nEvery moment of pain, every act of suffering I brought into this world… it wasn't for nothing. I allowed God to live through me, to feel what it means to be human. That was His wish, and I gave it to Him. Even if I couldn't see it through to the end, I did what He asked of me. I let Him feel.\n\nI lie here now, knowing I won't ever walk again. I won't ever leave this bed. But I still feel blessed. I was His vessel. I carried out His will, even if I didn't finish it.\n\nNo one knows what really happened that night. They think I'm a survivor, some poor soul who barely escaped with his life. But that's not true. I wasn't the victim. I was *chosen*. I was His instrument. And I will never forget that.\n\nI close my eyes, and sometimes I can still feel the wings, the weight of them, the blood dripping from the tips. In those moments, I smile. I may have disappointed Him, but I let Him live through me. I gave Him what He wanted. And that's enough."},"416":{"title":"Fragments of my mind","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1filx6o\/fragments_of_my_mind\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Beautiful_Deer307","selftext":"**I r**emember the first time I truly felt it—an icy grip tightening around my chest. I woke up one night, drenched in a cold sweat, the familiar shadows in my room twisting into grotesque shapes that crawled along the walls. They whispered secrets only I could hear, their voices a cacophony of madness that sent tremors down my spine. I had been reading about demontophobia, the fear of madness, trying to understand why it fascinated me so much.\n\nLittle did I know, it would soon devour me.\n\nAt first, I dismissed the sensations as mere nightmares. But as days turned into weeks, those dark tendrils crept deeper into my consciousness. I found myself standing in front of the bathroom mirror, staring wide-eyed at the reflection of a person I barely recognized. My own eyes, usually bright, had dulled, consumed by an all-encompassing fog of dread. I would hear my own voice whispering to me, urging me to confront the darkness, to embrace it.\n\n“You’re not afraid of insanity, are you?” it taunted, a mocking lilt dancing on the words.\n\nI tried to drown it out, tried to convince myself that sanity was a flickering flame I must protect. I’d dive into work, bury myself in tasks to drown out the sinister thoughts. But even then, the creeping dread slithered in during quiet moments—the hollow silence punctuated only by the soft ticking of the clock, mocking me with each restless second.\n\nOne fateful evening, unable to bear it any longer, I sought companionship; anything to escape the suffocating isolation. I joined an online support group, a gathering of lost souls sharing their fears and anxieties. It was here that I met Clara. She was articulate and soothing, her words wrapping around me like a warm blanket. Whenever I felt myself unraveling, I’d turn to our chats, always feeling a flicker of hope.\n\nHowever, Clara’s understanding came at a price. She began to share her own tales, and while they were captivating, they were always laced with an unsettling edge. One night, she told me about the “Voices”—how they had consumed her childhood, bled into her adulthood, until she could no longer tell where her identity ended and their madness began.\n\n“I invited them in,” she confessed, “and they’ve never left.”\n\nA shiver raced down my spine. Did I invite them in too? I already felt the edges of my life fraying, straying farther and farther from any semblance of normalcy. Clara’s words echoed in my mind long after our conversation ended, twisting into a mantra that played on repeat.\n\nDays turned into a blur, marked only by Clara’s increasingly erratic messages. She began to obsess over the “Door”—a conceptual portal into the abyss of pure insanity.\n\n“Once you cross it, you’ll never come back,” her messages warned, yet they were tantalizing, alluring in a way I couldn’t resist.\n\nMy sleep deteriorated, replaced by vivid dreams where I stood at the doorstep of a realm I didn’t understand, beckoning me with promises of freedom. Am I mad for even considering it? Frustration bubbled inside me; I needed to know. So, I decided to take a leap of faith.\n\nOne evening, I lit a candle and put on my headphones, searching for visualizations that promised to take me deeper into my own psyche. My room faded away, replaced by a swirling void, colors merging in a dance both beautiful and terrifying.\n\nAnd then, I heard it—the whispering escalated. The voices took shape, morphing into echoes of laughter and screams, all blended with my thoughts.\n\n“Join us,” they beckoned. It felt intoxicating, the anticipation sweeping through me as they unveiled the splendors of madness.\n\nAs I plunged deeper, I suddenly snapped back to my cluttered room, heart racing. The candle flickered pathetically in the dark. I pulled off my headphones, breathless. This wasn’t freedom; I had danced with the shadows and had been shaken back to reality.\n\nBut it was too late. Unbeknownst to me, something had followed me back. It lingered at the edge of my thoughts, warping my perceptions, distancing me from the world I once knew. I could no longer delineate what was real. My reflection in the mirror was devoid of life, a hollow imitation of the person I used to be.\n\nDesperation morphed into madness as I spiraled downwards, echoes of Clara’s laughter ringing in my mind. It was a twisted comfort. I tried reaching out to her one last time, but my messages went unanswered, as if she too had slipped into that lurking void.\n\nEach hour felt like a year, each tick of the clock like the toll of a bell marking my descent into insanity.\n\nIn the end, I realized the horrifying truth—madness isn’t a destination; it creeps in slowly, at first a whisper, a shadow at the edge of your mind. And when it envelops you, it is too late to turn back.\n\nNow, I sit locked in this barren room, writing this narrative as a last act of clarity before I plunge into the abyss. My heart pounds with dread, knowing the voices are closer than ever, hunger palpable, waiting for me to let go.\n\nAnd as I close my eyes, I embrace the madness, surrender to the laughter.\n\nAfter all, who better to guide me into that realm than the very insanity I had feared all along?"},"417":{"title":"Trying to find a creepypasta ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fi716u\/trying_to_find_a_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"BROITSJAZZY1111","selftext":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm fairly new to the creepypasta community—just joined a couple of months ago.

It's called the *Kagome Torii Ritual*, named after the torii gates that act as the threshold between the mortal world and the spiritual realm. The ritual is said to allow you to glimpse the future or change the course of your fate, but at a price—failure to complete the ritual properly could trap you in a cursed realm, doomed to wander the spirit world forever.\n\nThis ritual is no mere child’s game. You’re entering sacred territory, where the rules of the living world no longer apply. And once the gate opens, something might follow you back.\n\nThe origins of the Kagome Torii Ritual date back to Japan’s feudal era, where it was believed that certain *torii* gates—shrines often built at the entrances to sacred spaces—were cursed or misaligned with the spiritual world. These gates were thought to open not just to the *kami* (spirits of the land) but also to darker entities that dwelled between worlds.\n\nAccording to legend, a young samurai sought to change his fate after being dishonored in battle. He performed the ritual at a forgotten shrine deep in the mountains, hoping to glimpse a future where he could redeem himself. The ritual worked—he saw his future and gained great power, but he paid the ultimate price. He was never seen again, though travelers often report hearing strange whispers near the shrine where he performed the ritual.\n\nThis ancient practice has since become an urban legend among schoolchildren, thrill-seekers, and the lost souls who wish to change their fate. But beware, for those who enter the Kagome Torii often don’t return—or return changed.\n\n---\n\n### **The Requirements**\n\nBefore you attempt the Kagome Torii Ritual, you must gather the following:\n\n1. **A Small Wooden Torii Gate** – You can purchase a small replica of a torii gate from a shrine or create one yourself from wood or paper. It must be large enough for you to walk under without crouching, symbolizing your entrance into the spiritual world. The more authentic the materials, the stronger the ritual.\n\n2. **Kagome Kagome Song** – This traditional Japanese children’s song plays a crucial role. You must memorize it, as it will be sung during the ritual to summon the spirits. The song's eerie lyrics about being surrounded and trapped represent the dangerous nature of the ritual.\n\n3. **A Mirror** – The mirror will serve as your guide to see the future or change fate. It must be small enough to carry but large enough to see your entire face. A mirror handed down through family is ideal, as it is believed to carry ancestral energy, strengthening your connection to the spirit world.\n\n4. **Rice and Salt** – Offerings to appease the spirits. The rice represents sustenance, and the salt wards off malevolent forces. You’ll need these at the beginning and end of the ritual.\n\n5. **A Personal Item of Sentimental Value** – This item serves as a tether to the living world. You must choose wisely—something with emotional significance, like a childhood toy, a piece of jewelry, or a photograph.\n\n---\n\n### **The Ritual: Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Right Location**\n\nThe Kagome Torii Ritual must be performed at an actual torii gate, preferably one that is forgotten or seldom visited. Shrines deep in the forest or ones with a long history of supernatural sightings work best. Many urban legends say the more isolated and overgrown the shrine, the more potent the ritual.\n\nIf no such shrine is accessible, you can set up your own torii gate in a secluded location, but the risk increases dramatically. Creating a gate artificially may result in an unstable or more dangerous portal between worlds.\n\n**Step 2: Preparing the Space**\n\nArrive at your chosen location between 1:00 and 3:00 AM—the *witching hour*, when spirits are most active. Bring your torii gate replica, rice, salt, mirror, and personal item. Place the torii gate on the ground and sprinkle the rice and salt on both sides of it. This creates a safe boundary for you to pass through.\n\nStand before the torii gate and, before you pass under it, place your personal item at the base of the gate. This item will act as your connection to the living world, a tether that keeps you from getting lost.\n\n**Step 3: Passing Through the Torii**\n\nOnce everything is in place, you must step under the torii gate and walk through slowly, without looking back. As you pass through, recite the following chant in a whisper:\n\n_\"Kami of the gate, open the path,  \nLet me see what lies beyond wrath.  \nThrough this gate, I seek my fate,  \nBut beware, I leave my weight.\"_\n\nYou may feel a sudden shift in the air as you pass through the gate. The temperature may drop, or you may hear faint whispers or footsteps behind you. Do not turn around. Do not acknowledge them.\n\n**Step 4: The Kagome Kagome Song**\n\nOnce you’re through the gate, you must kneel in front of the mirror. Hold it up to your face and, looking directly into your reflection, sing the first verse of the *Kagome Kagome* song:\n\n_\"Kagome, Kagome,  \nThe bird in the cage,  \nWhen, oh when, will it come out?  \nIn the night of dawn,  \nThe crane and the turtle slipped,  \nWho stands behind you now?\"_\n\nAs you sing, continue staring into your reflection. You may notice subtle changes—a shift in the light, your reflection moving when you don’t, or a figure standing just behind you in the mirror. This is your spirit guide.\n\n**Step 5: The Choice**\n\nOnce you finish the song, you will hear a voice. It may come from the mirror, from behind you, or from the air itself. The voice will ask you one question: “*What do you seek?*”\n\nYou must respond clearly with your desire. Speak your wish aloud, but be careful of how you phrase it. The spirits are known to twist words and grant wishes with dark consequences. Many who ask for wealth become isolated, consumed by greed. Those who seek love often lose those they hold dearest, bound by the obsession of others.\n\nAs soon as you make your wish, something will happen. The mirror may shatter, or the reflection may vanish. You may feel an overwhelming dread, as though something is watching you. Stay calm, for the ritual is not over yet.\n\n**Step 6: Returning to the Living World**\n\nTo return safely, you must place the mirror down in front of you, look away, and slowly stand. Without turning around, take one step back through the torii gate. If you turn before you exit, you will become trapped between worlds, unable to return to the living.\n\nOnce you are safely on the other side, sprinkle the remaining salt and rice over the torii gate. This seals the gate and prevents spirits from following you back. Collect your personal item and leave the area without looking back.\n\n---\n\n### **The Consequences**\n\nYou will know within three days if your wish has been granted. Sometimes, it is immediate, as if fate itself has shifted overnight. But beware—there is always a price.\n\n- **Haunting Shadows:** After performing the Kagome Torii Ritual, many report seeing figures in the corner of their vision, shadows that flicker just beyond reach. These are spirits who were drawn to the ritual but could not cross through the gate. Some say they wait for an opportunity to drag you back into the cursed realm.\n  \n- **The Curse of the Guide:** If you speak your wish poorly, or if the spirit guide you saw is displeased, the consequences could be dire. Some have been followed by their guides, seeing them in reflections, windows, and mirrors. The more time passes, the closer they get, until the guide steps into the physical world to claim you.\n\n- **Loved Ones at Risk:** If your personal item was tied to a loved one, they may begin to experience misfortune as the spirit claims part of their essence in exchange for your wish. Illness, accidents, or even disappearances have been linked to those who performed the ritual.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Warnings**\n\n- **Never perform the ritual on a new moon.** The spiritual connection will be unstable, increasing the likelihood of being trapped in the spirit realm.\n- **Do not speak to anyone you see in the mirror other than the spirit guide.** Any other figure is a lost soul trying to escape. If you acknowledge them, they may take your place.\n- **Do not repeat the ritual.** The spirits will grow more aggressive with each attempt, and those who repeat the ritual are often found wandering the forests, mindless and empty-eyed, their souls trapped in the in-between.\n\nThe Kagome Torii Ritual offers you a chance to glimpse your future or alter your fate, but it’s not without its dangers. Some desires are better left unspoken, and once you open the gate to the spirit world, you may never truly be able to close it again."},"419":{"title":"Help me find this creepy pasta please","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fi4ebl\/help_me_find_this_creepy_pasta_please\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"OnFireDonkey","selftext":"~~Hello, I'm trying to find a creepypasta I heard narrated a while ago that I can't find anywhere now it may have been part of a larger series but I'm not sure about that.

I turned on my car and started driving. \n\nAt first I drove slowly, there were lots of cars,jeeps and trucks. But as soon as they cleared I darted across the streets quickly, the red and blue cars passing by me in a blitz almost seeming as large cylindrical hunks of metal rather than cars. \n\nI looked at the clock and it displayed 12:31.\n\nI remembered the many car accidents that happened in my city, so I slowed down my car. There were several cars in front of me, and when I saw the fog infront I started slowing down my car even more. \n\nI looked at the clock again and saw 12:37.\n\nThe fog slowly but surely settled in, at first anything 50 feet away from me was too foggy, then 40,then 30,then 20. \n\nAs I kept on driving I noticed how scarce cars or any other motor based vehicles were, the roads were completely empty of any cars, and only 3 cars were infront of me. \n\nI looked at the clock and it read 12:40 \n\nBy the time I reached a stoplight there wasn't a single car around me, the cars that were infront of me had taken turns and I was completely alone on the road.

And I saw no cars around me. \n\nI looked left,right and infront. There were no cars! This was alerting, usually at stoplights there were many cars. I have gotten worried that I might be driving in a potential weather disaster. I looked behind me and oddly there were no cars behind me. I looked infront and the stoplight was still red. The clock read 12:48. \n\nI waited, the clock turned 12:49. \n\nI waited, the clock turned 12:50 \n\nI started worrying, was there some sort of electrical error and the stoplight was stuck at red? I saw the stoplight go from green to red when I was driving. Why was the stoplight not turning green? \n\nI kept staring at the stoplight and around me,then at the clock. \n\n12:51 \n\n12:52 \n\nI started feeling uneasy,If there was a electrical problem then I should have just started driving, but what if I broke the law and the cops started chasing me? \n\n12:53 \n\n12:54\n\nI started feeling restless,I was sweaty and worried.

I looked at the clock and it read  12:55 . \n\nI tried starting my car so I can start driving,for some reason my car didn't move and i heard someone tap on mybut every time I tried my car simply couldn't start! Then I heard a loud and audible tap on my trunk. I quickly turned around and saw no one. I remembered that I locked my trunk before I went to my job this morning,so I felt a relief. \n\nI tried starting the car again several times but the car just simply didn't start!

I tried and I tried but my car simply wouldn't start! I looked at the clock and it read 12:57. Just then I heard whistling, whistling coming from one of those things that can produce a loud whistle. \n\nI looked infront of me and saw a man in old police uniform coming out of the fog,whistling. He was moving his hands around like he was telling which cars to stop and which ones to go. \n\nI tried starting my car and my car finally started working.\n\nI then saw the stoplight turning green. \n\nWhen he was 10 feet away from my car I saw that he looked completely normal. \n\n He stopped whistling when he was 5 feet away from my car and looked at me, he walked to my window and I heard him say \"be careful\"  and he continued walking. \n\nI looked at the clock, 12:58.i started driving forward and after 15 minutes of driving I started seeing cars again on the road. When 13:20 appeared in my clock majority of the fog was gone. And by the time 13:25 appeared the   fog was completely gone and sunlight started peering from the clouds. \n\nAt 13:30 I arrived infront my apartment, even more sunlight beamed from the clouds,I got out of my car and locked the car. \n\nI ran to my apartment and when I entered I locked the door. \n\nBy 14:30 I looked out of my window and saw that majority of the clouds had gone to some other place, the sun was beaming brightly onto the land. \n\nA smile dawned on my face,I finally felt safe."},"422":{"title":"My parents died in a car crash on their way home from dropping me off at Stanford","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ficr8g\/my_parents_died_in_a_car_crash_on_their_way_home\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Main-Bill883","selftext":"blabalabka\n"},"423":{"title":"Someone, please teach me manners!

Pressing my back against the wall, shifting my position yet never finding an ideal spot. It wasn’t comfortable, I had to wrestle the urge to go away. The toothy cold gnawed at my face and fingertips. I expected some chill, but not this. My arm grew weary while holding my phone, which I felt getting heavier by the second. I now understood why the place had gained a haunted reputation. That gas station wasn’t in the best conditions, faded painting in most parts, from the floor to the canopy. Some light bulbs were weaker and dirtier than others, gathering flies stuck in cobwebs, about to meet their hairy, many-eyed, wall walking, eight-legged demise. The view mirrored an old grey photo, all color having retreated under the indifferent grasp of night. The fact that I noticed this proves that I was bored of waiting. Still no signs of the supposed blood stained tire marks that would appear where a person got ran over here a decade ago. I wasn’t there for that, of course, it had always struck me as a made up story with no regards to believability.\n\n \n\n I took the unusual opportunity to go through horror stories put in my ever-expanding read later list. It worked, to great effect. The reckless solitary stay under the dark sky made me feel tense, helpless. The previous boredom dismembered as I read about supernatural monsters and gruesome murders. It was exciting, it brought me to the edge, and you should definitely not do it. Despite being skeptical of the more mystic elements, it reminded me that people are just as horrifying. No criminals went out at night on that town, as something worse takes their place instead, that’s the saying. I was there to learn why. Yet my doubts grew bigger. I consider myself good in putting apart fiction from reality. But something felt different, hazier, dreamlike. I was failing to calm down my fearful side with rational thinking. In a burst of caution, I looked around. The only sources of light being the gas station and copy-pasted streetlights besides the road in front. A single shade of darkness covered everything else. I was ready to go inside the main building, but the humming of an approaching car made me stop.\n\n  \n The last thing you want to do is to run away. I retold these words to myself. If the story was true then the best thing to do is wait. Sounds of the engine got closer, coming from down the road. A faint white fog started to build up close to the ground. The humid air made breathing a laborious task, I felt the cold droplets build on my face. The car sounded more threatening than ever, and the urge to run assaulted my mind. I felt the string of muscles in my legs tense up, ready to work, the act of standing in place instead felt suicidal. I looked at the road, but I saw no signs of the car whose noise spread over the whole place. It was empty despite the feeling that the noise was coming from right in front of me. As I noticed more aspects of the supernatural, an unexplainable wave of drowsiness struck me. The cold hard wall on my back now feeling like an inviting mattress as I closed my eyes. The sound of the car being overridden by noiseless sleep.\n\n \n\n When my eyes opened, I saw a hearse parked on the road in front of me. It was covered in black paint and it had a metallic reflection. It was clean and polished. I could feel the aroma of an old car with my eyesight, even if I was too far to smell it. I saw the silhouette of a woman through the side window, she was sitting in the back of the car and looking forwards. The figure’s outline sharply defined, contrasting the glow of the streetlights. She remained deathly still, like a portrait behind the glass. Seconds later, the door on the driver’s seat started to open. Slowly, the way it moved evidenced it’s heavy weight. I heard strained hinges. I don’t know if the sound was actually real of part of my imagination, given how far I was from the car. When the door opened, the urge to run overwhelmed me, yet I didn’t move. However, this time my stillness wasn’t a product of a rational mind, but instead of an indescribable sense of doom that paralyzed my very soul.\n\n \n\n A figure stepped out of the driver’s seat. It had a pale skull, which rested on top of a set of long bones, each bone lodged inside each holes on the lower part of the cranium, giving it support. Sets of cloaks, belts and garments that resembled a rich man from a century ago covered the rest of his body. His clothes, grey and black, stretched from his shoulders to the ground, in a confusing array of layers. The fog from earlier thickened, covering the floor as the figure started to move in my direction. He approached me at a constant pace, without any of the fluctuations of speed and body movements of someone on two legs. Instead, he moved like he was sliding on ice. He kept his head high as his posture mimicked royalty. I pressed my feet hard against the ground and started running. Or at least I thought I did, but despite feeling the strain on my flesh, my body remained still. My legs chose to stay in place and my eyes decided to lock on the one who was approaching me. Darkness coated every object in my view as he walked past it. As far as my vision was concerned, everything behind him ceased to exist.\n\n \n\n After an agonizing amount of time, he finally reached me. Bringing an ashy smell with him.\n\n \n\n “Hello there, friend… Care to hear a story?”\n\n \n\n Surprise slapped me in the face, I took time to process that he was talking to me. The gravely, deep voice carried casual words were delivered with power. The sudden shift in tension stunned me. The dark smoke behind him dissipated and I felt the control of my muscles returning. Yet I remained alarmed, with a shaking feeling inside my chest. I could hear impatient demand from the few words he uttered. Feeling like I was on a timer, I gave him a quick and thoughtless answer as I tried to step away.\n\n \n\n “I-I am sorry sir… But I’d rather not… I’m waiting for someone and-“\n\n \n\n His unearthly appearance and overwhelming aura mutilated my chances to speak with calm and confidence. I showed out hesitation and fear as I tried to come up with a dismissive excuse. He caught this then moved closer. The void eye sockets kept staring at me as he grumbled with authority.\n\n \n\n “I am trying to have a nice talk with you and I am not a fan of being denied, kid. A talk with me is more fruitful than whatever pointless thing you are doing. Show your manners and hear what I have to say!”\n\n \n\n His tone was now more threatening and aggressive, ripping through the silent night with hostility. Seeing the danger in the situation, I stopped in place. I then looked at the ground, foggy enough to conceal my feet. I used the break in eye contact to think better of a way to salvage the situation.\n\n \n\n “Of course! I… I would love to hear what you have to say! J-Just go on, I’m all ears…”\n\n \n\n My words were nervous. My mind raced in anticipation to his answer as I conjured a shaky smile. I tried to back away from him, but a wall behind me blocked my movements. I felt the cold pierce through my clothes and cause shivers on my skin.\n\n \n\n “Your fake enthusiasm does not fool me, boy.”\n\n \n\n He spoke with a patronizing sting. Then he let the words sink in for a second before continuing.\n\n \n\n “I will let this one pass, but I will not tolerate any further disrespect.”\n\n \n\n In contrast to mine, his words were firm and decisive. He cleared his non-existent throat then spoke again.\n\n \n\n “You see, an immense tragedy has struck my family some time ago. My lovely sister, killed by a terrible, terrible illness! We could only watch as she spat her bones out, one by one!”\n\n \n\n He exclaimed in an over the top fashion, his bony jaw opening wide as he did so. Something under his shoulders, beneath his cloak, moved to add to the drama. This made me doubt how much the event affected him, or if it was even real to begin with. Feeling the need to answer, I came up with some awkward words.\n\n \n\n “I see… Well I-“\n\n \n\n The figure interrupted me before I could finish my sentence.\n\n \n\n “She was indeed a very caring and kind person. It is very saddening to see something like this happen… Is it not?”\n\n \n\n I felt pressured to show empathy to his troubles. Inside, his words failed to move me. I never lost someone close, neither did I know how to react to it. While I pondered, a sound of approaching steps on wet dirt, then on hard ground, surprised my ears. I lifted my head to look around, doing this reminded of the macabre appearance of the person in front of me. My mind forgot about the sound and stumbled over a more pressing matter, answering before he got angry again. Still, I was indifferent to the death of someone unknown, no matter how much I tried to make it seem otherwise. Any semblance of compassion crushed under my fear of him.\n\n \n\n “I-It must’ve been hard for you... I guess it happens…”\n\n \n\n Electricity fills the air the moment I stop talking. The figure moves closer, invading my personal space before scoffing his words out.\n\n \n\n “It happens? How can you give such a heartless and cruel answer? My sister died and that is all you have to say?”\n\n \n\n I’m taken aback, not expecting this kind of reaction. Pointy bones start piercing his clothes from inside and popping out. The sense of having made a mistake grew in my chest.\n\n \n\n “I-I’m sorry… I didn’t mean it like that!”\n\n \n\n He lunged forward but stopped just as quick. In reflex, I jumped back, hitting my head against the wall in a painful thud. A sudden awareness of how fast my heart was beating struck me.\n\n \n\n “Enough! It seems that no one has ever taught you proper manners!”\n\n I could taste his threats. The ashy stench coming out of him almost made me choke. I felt his cold breath settling down in my exposed neck, like a dirtying smoke. I got paralyzed, and the only thing I could move were my eyeballs. Staring back at the old worn page yellowish skull. Noticing a crack that went from the bump of his nose to half an inch under his left eye socket, which seemed to be growing. We both glared at each other. The only thing breaking the silence were my own uneasy breaths.\n\n \n\n His stillness confused and frightened me. I expected him to move and rip me apart at any moment, yet it wasn’t happening. He stood there, like a creepy murder toy watching a paranoid child. After the shock dissipated a bit, I managed to look away from him. Only to set my sights on something just as terrifying.\n\n \n\n On the building’s corner, from where the earlier step sounds came, there was a man-shaped shadow. Entirely black and looking at me while also not moving an inch. I averted my eyes again, only to notice other two similar figures. One behind a column, underneath a light bulb but still just as somber. The other behind a bush, right in front of the forest. Lastly, my gaze went back to the car, the hearse which the figure stepped out of. The woman-like silhouette had turned and now looked at me. The newfound awareness of the unexpected audience heightened the sense of dread. Every one of them had the eerie ability to emanate sheer judgment, despite not moving or saying anything. It felt like they were able to read my thoughts thoroughly, coming out with the worst possible conclusions about me. A swarm of possible next actions infested my mind. But it felt like every single one was being unanimously disapproved of before they even came to be.\n\n \n\n Time seemed to have stopped around me. Even the wind showed no signs of movement. As my mind wandered, a sharp, booming voice slashed through the fearful peace.\n\n \n\n “Don’t you know it’s rude to focus on other things while talking to someone?”\n\n \n\n I looked back at the imposing figure in front of me. I felt his anger buzzing in the air. In a sudden movement, his skull started to morph like dough. Acquiring stretched, surreal shapes. Sometimes becoming a bony ball. Sometimes filled with trios of small holes that vaguely resembled screaming faces. I heard more livid words, but the voice didn’t seem to come from him anymore, but from my own eardrums instead.\n\n \n\n I could only watch as the figure moved closer. His skull finally settled in the shape of an elongated horse skull, an inch from touching my nose. In a moment, the wind turned warm and started hitting against my face. Stopping for a second then grazing on my skin again. In and out, in the same rhythm of a person breathing. The voice no longer came from him, the calm and calculative nature of a doctor replacing the previous anger. I felt everything around me dissolving into a lightless abyss. Telling me to focus on the thing in front of me.\n\n  \n “Allow me to teach you something. The best way to get someone like you back in line is through fear. Fear will make you think twice before speaking. Fear will help you stay quiet when you should. Fear will teach you respect towards those over you. It is quick, effective and long lasting.”\n\n \n\n I saw something rustling underneath his robes, moving around on his midsection.\n\n \n\n “And I know the exact way to put this fear into you. Do not worry, this is for your own good…”\n\n \n\n From the midst of his robes poked out a bone of a finger, and after it, a hundred more. Some short and chubby, some long and thin, nearly touching the floor. A whole fan of mismatched skeletal scraps opened. Each bone pressing and merging with another. Each pointy finger bursting out of the agglomerate like leafless branches from the trunk of a tree. As he raised his hand, each part of it seemed autonomous and disharmonic. Crushing and snapping each other in half as a buzz of dry crackling reached my ears.\n\n \n\n Before I noticed it, a few larger fingers were already holding me in place. I used my full strength break free, but to no result. Not a budge. My efforts weren’t even enough to get his annoyance.\n\n \n\n “It will be over soon.”\n\n \n\n As he spoke, a whip-like finger slithered out of the mess and started moving closer. I couldn’t contain the shortness on my breath as I saw it aim for my next, behaving like it had a life of it’s own. When the spiky tip methodically started piercing my skin, I felt a sharp pain on my chest and lost control over my muscles. He didn’t let me fall to the ground, and instead kept me in place. I was reduced to what my sensitive nerves could feel, the blurred mess my startled eyes could see and the wordless thoughts my dizzy brain could make.\n\n \n\n “The satisfaction of showing someone their place is like no other... Squirm more for me!”\n\n \n\n Instead of the expected pain, I felt my flesh opening up by itself instead. It read his intentions and obeyed by allowing passage. I could feel the soft bone entering my neck, slowly, pushing my flesh and blood vessels apart like a surgeon on duty. Wriggling deeper and deeper inside like a worm burrowing through dirt. My focus was on the bone chilling sensation of my throat pressing against his bony finger every time I gasped on instinct. The agonizing sensation similar to having something stuck on my throat took over me. My body tried to fight by coughing, shaking, sweating, aching, anything to make it stop. Make it stop!\n\n \n\n In a final display of precision. He wrapped his finger around my spinal cord and gently, oh so gently, pressed down on my nerves. At this point, my organs took over. Reacting in a botched soup of liquid emotions, gut-muddying cravings and autonomous moves. Each trying to escape in their own incomprehensible way. Revoking my mind’s control over them.\n\n \n\n Despite this, the figure remained a statue. His inability to have facial expressions doing little to stop the satisfaction coming from his words.\n\n \n\n “I sincerely hope that you have learned your lesson now. We will meet again. I expect more from you then.”\n\n \n\n With that, he pressed his finger a tad harder on my nerves. My body shut down completely in response. I could only see the inners of my eyelids as I got unconscious. My body hitting hard but numbly against the ground.\n\n \n\n It has been a few hours since this has happened. I barely remember the way back home. Only a few quick lapses of memory. Of the empty street and my confusion towards the sudden disappearance of the things I saw.\n\n \n\n When I arrived, I had trouble finding the way around my own place because of a terrible headache. On top of that, the repulsive feeling of having something lodged on my throat still haunts me. I’m having trouble to breathe. Whenever I try to eat or drink something, a tingling sensation accompanied by an urge to vomit overwhelms me. Earlier, while in front of a mirror, I noticed a grey spot on my neck, pulsating at its own rhythm. Nothing I did could take it off, scratching, cleaning or poking it. I even got the urge to grab a sharp knife and cut it off, regardless of the implied risks, but for now, I’m able to hold myself back.\n\n \n\n Right now, I’m in front of my computer, more collected than before. All my doors and windows are locked. I’m acting like a paranoid lunatic. I’m not even sure if I’m writing this down or if I’m already asleep, having a cruel dream. I heard his threats of seeing me again and I will not take them lightly. I’m going to share this story around the internet in hopes that someone will find it and help me with this. I’m scared. I don’t know if I’ll be able to survive the fated next encounter. So please, help me. I know that I can’t do much in return, but I want to live. Tell me what I did wrong, what I should do now. Anything that can help. I’ll stay awake through the night. I’m counting on you.\n\n \n\n Update: I need to write this fast. He’s here! The hearse is here! In front of my house. How did he know? I’m scared of what might happen if I don’t answer. No more editing, I’m posting the story right now. I’m going downstairs to greet him. I’ll try to read any messages hat come. I hope I don’t mess this up. Wish me luck…"},"424":{"title":"This still haunts me! - Watch the full animated story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fi1k2z\/this_still_haunts_me_watch_the_full_animated_story\/","flair":"Video","author":"Sudden-Zombie9098","selftext":"This still haunts me.

Even when Kelly's husband sleep walks he still hits her. Kelly's husband always apologises to her for hitting her while he is a sleep.

Kelly goes to bed now wearing protective gear just in case her husband hits her again. She has even gotten marks on body for the amount of times she has gotten physically abused by her husband. \n\nIt's all accidental though due to her husbands slee walking and sleep movement issues. The husband isn't doing it in purpose and it is all sleep issues. The husband went to all kinds of sleep specialists and he was still hitting his wife while a sleep. Even worse was when he was sleep walking and he was destroying stuff around the house, and he was still punching and hitting Kelly. It was becoming more aggressive and all of the sleep doctors and sleep specialists were all truly dumbfounded. Kelly was afraid when her husband went to sleep. \n\nShe couldn't stop her husband from sleeping though, but she did notice that her husbands sleep walks and sleeping in general were more physically aggressive, when he had a hard week at work. It was also aggressive when the bills were high and in general whenever life got tough, his sleep walks and in general sleeping were more aggressive. Due to desperation Kelly went to a witch doctor to help something with her husbands sleeping. The witch doctor gave her something which could help her enter her husbands dreams. \n\nKelly was astounded by this and by entering her husbands dreams or unconscious sleeping mind, she could make it less violent. So she tried it when her husband was being violent again but it didn't work. She was beaten up by her sleep walking husband. She went back to the witch doctor and she complained to her as to how she was tricked. The witch doctor claimed that if the rituals didn't work, then it's because your isn't a sleep but rather he is very much awake. Kelly was astounded again. \n\nHer husbands sleep movements and sleep walks are more violent during when he is passed off more after a hard week of work, or having to fix the car, or paying off stuff. He is pretending to be sleep walking.

I've been living in my van for roughly eight months and I'm done after this. The day was like any other day. I woke up and started my boring antisocial life I loved so much. I edited a few videos, ate some leftover meatloaf, and played some video games, you know the basics. I parked the van on the side of a camp ground up near the Colorado Rockies. It was getting late and I wanted to use what sunlight I had left to set up camp. The snow was pretty low at that point, probably from a snowfall a few days prior. I got out my firepit and got a little fire going. I was the only vehicle at the car lot, but I guess that didn't seem weird because it was in the middle of nowhere. As the night grew near, I received a warning on my radio about a blizzard that was due to hit in the next hour. I put my things away and got into my van, bracing for the blizzard. I wasn't to worried as I had a propane heater inside the van incase it got to cold.\n\nThe blizzard hit and it hit hard. The wind rocking my van snow covering the windows and sealing me inside the van. I panicked a little ill be honest, the thought of freezing to death flooding my thoughts. I remember laying in bed with my blankets wrapped around me and dozing off. at some point it got really quiet, so quiet it woke me up. I figured the wind had died down and it finally settled so I sat up. I wondered if I should go assess the situation and see how bad it was. Id say it went on for about 3 hours so it got pretty deep. I decided to make some coffee and warm up before I went out. I started to get dressed and put on my boots. Just as I pull up my boot a noise catches my attention. What sounds like something trotting through deep snow is making its way towards my van. Heavy footsteps approach from what I figure was about 30 yards out. I don't move a muscle, even my breath slowed down to basically nothing. My body was riddled with goosebumps as fear pulsed through me. My first thought was moose, but then there's also bears out here. I couldn't see anything thru the thick snow lining my windows. The footsteps were about 10 yards away at this point still making their way towards me.\n\nMy body begins to shake violently. I'm not sure if it was from the cold or the fear but I couldn't stop. I could hear what sounded like humming coming from the direction of the noises. It was very low and didn't really sound like anything I knew. It was getting closer and closer, the humming and footsteps were about 5 yards away now and I was almost certain this was no moose or bear. The footsteps stop right outside the rear of my van. The only windows I have are the front seat windows so I cant see anything out of the rear. A voice breaks the silence cold and small.\n\n\"Hello in there, may I have a word with you.\" It said in a voice from what sounded like a little girl.\n\nI almost melted into the ground at that point. My body was absolutely trembling, sweat pouring out from all over my body. Terror doesn't describe the feeling I had at that moment in time. I remained silent, refusing to utter even a breath. Now I really knew it wasn't an animal. First of all that walking sounded way to heavy to be a little girl. Its almost 1am right after a bad blizzard and its out in the middle of no where. No weapon or anything really to defend myself with, I felt absolutely helpless.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you I just need help.\" It said.\n\n\"Please do not ignore me, Its very rude.\" It said in a slightly deeper tone.\n\n\"Y.. I.. wh...\" I spit out not being able to talk from the terror I was in.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" It asked.\n\nI slowly picked my head up and looked at the back of the van. I gulped, took a deep breath, and forced out what little I could say.\n\n\"What's the problem?\" I said thru chattering teeth.\n\n\"No not a problem, I just wanted to ask if you had a tooth for me.\" It said.\n\n\"A tooth?\" I thought to myself.\n\n\"You need a tooth?\" I asked the voice.\n\n\"Yes, Just a tooth.\" It asked happily.\n\nMy mind was in a million different places at this point. Who the hell was I talking to? What did they want with a tooth. Was this some sort of monster you hear about in some travel channel show? I wasn't really sure what it was, but I was afraid nonetheless. I began to reason with myself. Maybe another car pulled up and I didnt realize it and they wanted to play a prank on me because they recognize the van.\n\n\"I don't have a tooth, can you please go away this isn't funny.\" I said\n\nThe sweet voice that asked so kindly for a tooth moments ago, changed almost immediately into a twisted dark deep voice like some kind of demon.\n\n\"Give me one of your teeth willingly, or I will rip the teeth from your skull one by one!\" It yelled.\n\nI began to search thru my van for a weapon, something I could fight this thing with if I had to. All I had was a hammer that was stashed under the engine hood in the front seat. I raised the hood and grabbed the hammer. I stood in the van, hammer in hand like some dollar store Thor. I turned around and thats when I remembered the shark tooth hanging from my visor. I ripped the tooth from the visor and went to the back of the van.\n\n\"I have a tooth for you.\" I said body still shaking uncontrollably from the adrenaline.\n\n\"THROW IT OUT NOW!\" It yelled again so loud it shook the van.\n\nI slid the van door open only to be met with a wall of snow the wind pushed against it. I stuffed the tooth into the snow and slid the door closed and locked it. A loud bang on the back doors and a loud scratch followed all the way from the back to the side door and stopped.\n\n\"Thanks for the tooth.\" It said back in the little sweet voice from before.\n\nThe humming began again and the loud heavy footsteps made their way away from my van. I curled up in the fetal position on the ground of the van until I couldn't hear the footsteps anymore. I jumped up turned the engine over  and began to let it heat up. I sat for about 15 minutes then I began the drive back home from my last day as a van life youtuber. I'm still not sure what to chalk it up to but I don't see myself going around the Rockies again ever."},"432":{"title":"Killer Mark (A true story)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhvpwt\/killer_mark_a_true_story\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Beautiful_Deer307","selftext":"\"You know, it's weird how the quiet ones are always the ones you suspect first.\"\n\n\n\nMy friend's words echoed in my mind as I looked around the dimly lit room. The party had been a bust. A bunch of us had decided to spend the night at Mark's place, a dilapidated old mansion on the edge of town that had seen better days. The floorboards creaked with every step, and the wallpaper peeled in places, revealing the dry, yellowed plaster beneath. The house had been in his family for generations, and it showed. It had the eerie charm of a place that held secrets.\n\n\n\nMark was indeed the quiet type. He'd inherited the mansion from his grandparents and had moved in alone after graduating high school. He never talked much about his life before that, which only added to the mystery. Whenever we'd ask him about the noises we heard at night, he'd just shrug and say it was the house settling. But something about the way he said it sent shivers down my spine. It was as if he was hiding something.\n\n\n\nThe party had been going strong until the lights flickered and died. We'd all laughed at first, but as the minutes ticked by and the darkness grew thicker, the laughter had turned to nervous whispers. Mark had gone to check the fuse box, and that was the last we saw of him. We found candles scattered throughout the house, and we lit them one by one, the flickering light casting dancing shadows on the walls. The air grew colder with each passing moment, and the whispers grew quieter.\n\n\n\nMy heart raced as I heard a faint sound, like the rustling of fabric, coming from the next room. \"Guys?\" I called out, but the only response was the echo of my own voice. The shadows grew longer and more sinister, and the candlelight seemed to push the darkness into the corners, only for it to seep back out again. I swallowed hard, trying to convince myself that it was just the old house playing tricks on my mind. But the feeling of being watched grew stronger, and I couldn't shake the image of Mark standing there in the shadows, a twisted smile playing on his lips.\n\n\n\nWe decided to split up and look for him, which was probably the dumbest thing we could have done. The house was a labyrinth of corridors and staircases that led to nowhere. I took the east wing, the part of the mansion that was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Mark's great-aunt, who had allegedly killed herself in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Each door I passed felt heavier, as if it were trying to keep me from discovering what lay beyond. I reached the top of the stairs and paused, the candle casting a feeble glow around me.\n\n\n\nThe rustling grew louder, and the air grew colder still. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. I took a deep breath and stepped into the first room, the floorboards groaning beneath my weight. The room was empty, save for a dusty four-poster bed and a wardrobe that looked like it hadn't been opened in decades. I shivered, the candle flame flickering as if in response to my fear. It was then that I heard it—a soft, muffled cry. It was faint, but it was definitely human. It was coming from the room at the end of the hall.\n\n\n\nMy heart hammering in my chest, I approached the door. It was slightly ajar, and through the crack, I could see a sliver of dim light. The crying grew louder as I got closer, and I recognized the voice—it was Mark. I pushed the door open gently, the hinges squeaking in protest. The room was a mess, with clothes and books scattered everywhere. In the corner, huddled over something on the floor, was Mark, his face a mask of despair. My blood turned to ice as I saw what lay before him—one of my friends, unmoving, a knife buried deep in his chest.\n\n\n\n\"Mark?\" I choked out, my voice trembling.\n\n\n\nHe looked up, his eyes wild with a mix of terror and something else—malice. The knife glinted in his hand as he yanked it out of the lifeless body. His gaze locked onto me, and he bolted upright, the bedspring groaning beneath him. In that moment, I realized my mistake. He wasn't crying over a tragedy; he was crying in anticipation of his next victim. And that victim was me.\n\n\n\nWith a snarl, Mark lunged towards me, the knife raised high. I stumbled back, the flame of my candle throwing erratic shadows on the walls. My heart was a jackhammer in my chest as I fumbled for the door, my mind racing to find a way out. But the floorboards had other plans. One step too many on the rotted wood, and I heard the unmistakable sound of a board giving way. With a splintering crack, I plummeted through the floor, the candle extinguishing as I fell into the abyss below.\n\n\n\nThe fall seemed to last an eternity, darkness swallowing me whole. I landed hard on the first floor, the impact sending shockwaves through my body. The wind was knocked out of me, and for a moment, I couldn't breathe. The house groaned around me, as if alive with the horror of what had just transpired. I scrambled to my feet, my eyes frantically searching for an escape. I could hear Mark's footsteps pounding down the stairs, growing louder with each passing second. Panic clouded my thoughts, but instinct took over.\n\n\n\nI stumbled through the moonlit foyer, my eyes landing on the front door. The handle felt cold and solid in my hand, and I yanked it open with all the strength I could muster. The night air rushed in, a stark contrast to the stale, suffocating air of the mansion. My legs propelled me forward, carrying me to the safety of my car parked just outside. The engine roared to life, and I threw the gear into reverse, tires screeching against the gravel as I backed out. The house loomed in the rearview mirror, a monolith of malevolence that had swallowed my friend whole.\n\n\n\nEight years had passed since that fateful night. I had tried to bury the memories deep, to convince myself that it had all been a terrible nightmare. But the news reports had brought it all back—Mark had been caught, and the trial was about to begin. They called him \"Killer Mark,\" and the details of his crimes made my stomach churn. He had killed over a dozen people in that house, each one a grisly tapestry of fear and pain. And I had been there, witnessed it with my own eyes, and lived to tell the tale."},"433":{"title":"The Pisser: Part Two","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhslpc\/the_pisser_part_two\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Mysterious-Ad-4795","selftext":"Archetti pulled his knife from his belt. The sharp blade glinted green from the streetlight (it was no longer red). Reese was breathing erratically, the air whistling through his nose. Archetti apologized to Reese for what he was about to do. If Reese heard him, great. If not, cry about it later. The tip of the knife touched Reese’s crusty lips. It was impossible to restrict the movement of Reese’s head while holding the knife steady. For Archetti, he was playing football with ten guys on the field, and the plum-faced coach yelling, “Don, you’re the quarterback and the wide receiver, now go win the fucking game!”\nArchetti, with surgical prudence, pushed the knife between Reese’s lips. He could feel the warm blood leaking from the corners of Reese’s mouth and onto his hands. Fuck this. I knew I should have called for backup. What the hell were you thinking? Kablooie! A popping sound bounced around the cabin like a volcano had erupted. Archetti looked up and saw soupy pink and white viscera tendrils dripping from the cruiser’s ceiling. One of the pustules on Reese’s head had reached capacity and exploded. Archetti pulled the knife away from Reese’s lips and covered his nose. The vile smell put a lump of vomit in his throat.  \nSuddenly, blinding white light filled the cruiser. Archetti gaped out the back windshield, his heart panicked. A truck was speeding toward the cruiser, the lights getting closer and closer. The truck had to be going sixty miles per hour because before Archetti had time to jump back into his seat and buckle himself in, the truck smashed into the cruiser. Wham! The cruiser’s back tires left the ground for a nanosecond as a jumbled symphony of breaking glass and metal banged inside Archetti’s head. The cruiser spun around one hundred and eighty degrees. \nThe engine was smoking and sizzling like someone had tossed a bucket of water on a hot grill. Archetti, facing upside down in the crunched-up backseat, not one hundred percent sure he was alive, listened powerlessly to the thunderous clopping of boots marching toward him. He heard masculine voices, but what they said was badly muffled. The violent clangor of the wreck continued to ring in Archetti’s eardrums; the world sounded like he was eight feet underwater. Archetti tried to move, but he was stuck, his legs pinned. The electronics in the cruiser were on the fritz, and the interior lights blinked in and out without rhyme or reason. You weren’t the only one in the car… Why didn’t the truck stop?! What the fuck was that?! You were not the only person in the car…\n“Reese,” Archetti said. Silence was Reese’s reply. \nArchetti heard the wail of an off-its-hinges-door opening. The manly voices were on top of him. They were militant in tone. Clueless to their volitions, Archetti decided to play dead, self-preservation at the forefront of his mind. He closed his eyes and ebbed his breathing. He prayed to Jehovah that the men didn’t hear him call out for Reese. \nArchetti pictured the faces of his wife and kids and promised himself there would be no coup de grace on his watch. As a father and a husband, there were rites of passage he needed to see through. Walking Ava down the aisle to give her away at her wedding with tears in his eyes. To witness Marshall in his cap and gown at his high school graduation, proudly clapping and cheering for him because he secured a full ride to Princeton. And Candice, the love of his life, they’d be happy empty nesters, and in the newfound quiet of their home, they’d tumble to the bed and fall asleep in each other’s arms, a two-week vacation to Portugal waiting for them when they awoke. \n An immediate stabbing pain beamed an emergency text to Archetti’s side: “Attention needed right fucking now,” it said. But he could hear someone foraging through the cabin. He had to eat the pain and accept the momentary punishment, which was the Bluebeard key to holding his wife and kids back again. \n“Is he breathing?” \n“Yeah, I got a pulse.” \n“Is he awake?”\n“Negative. Concussion. Bad one.” \n“Roger that. Let’s extract him and move out.”\n“Christ…”\n“What is it?”\n“The sores on his head. They all popped.”\n“Do I need to call it in?”\n“No. It’s just… the crash must’ve been unbearably painful.”\n“We don’t get paid to have feelings for samples. Anything else fucked up on him?” \n“Lemme examine him.” \nThe pain below Archetti’s ribs made him flex his toes against the vamp of his police boots. He battled to keep his peepers shut and not move a limb. These men, whoever they were, needed to think Archetti was pushing up daisies. Why didn’t I feel this out-of-this-world pain before? \nThe magnitude of the accident caused Archetti’s adrenal system to put his body into a brief window of hibernation. Archetti’s brain, major organs, and cortisol coordinated their signals to preserve his body’s vitals. Once all the vital programs cleared the necessary checkpoints, Archetti’s pain receptors flipped back on. Life found a way by taking a snooze.  \n“Damn, he’s got a broken leg.”\n“Roger that, what part?”\n“Um… feels like the tibia.”\n“Compound?” \n“I don’t see any protrusions. No blood.”\n“He’s lucky he’s light as a feather. Extraction team, you’re clear to proceed.”\n\nArchetti woke up in Harveston Regional Hospital. Franklin Hill had a building they called a hospital, but it was more like a glorified urgent care. Stitches and basic blood work were where they hit the ceiling in terms of actionable care. The first person Archetti saw was Candice. She was sitting in a brown recliner, her hand on her face and looking down at her phone. She looked beautiful but tired. Outside the windows, the sun was baking Archetti's face. It felt good, damn good. \n“Hey,” he said, hoarse and grainy. \nCandice shot out of the chair and speed-walked over to her husband. He held his hand out. She gripped it tight. He gazed at her gold wedding band and stared into her teary eyes. She smiled at him, and her chestnut-colored hair was luminous from the sunlight shining on her back. \n“You look like an angel,” Archetti said, wanting to shed a few tears of happiness but couldn’t because his lacrimal glands were dry as dusty wells. \n“You’re not dead,” Candice said. “And on a lot of painkillers.” \nShe let out a small laugh, and Archetti matched it. He asked where the kids were and got the report: Ava was staying at a friend’s house, and Candice’s mother, Terri, had driven up from Virginia to watch Marshall. Candice had been staying overnight, having breakfast and lunch at the hospital. She’d commute home around 5 pm to make dinner for the kids, eat what she could, and drive back to Harveston Regional to sit with her husband. \n“How long?” Archetti asked. \n“Three days,” Candice said. “Think of it as a long blackout. Like you drank two handles of tequila, and for dessert, you decided to smoke a bag of weed.” \nSimilar to the adrenaline junkie days, Archetti’s heavy drinking days were a thing of the past too. He couldn’t remember the last time he blacked out from too much of the drink. Archetti went to sit up, wanting to be closer to his wife’s heart-shaped face. He grimaced in pain and looked at the clear tubes pumping drugs and saline into his body. It was the same pain Archetti had playing dead in the cruiser but fantastically numbed by the hydrocodone flowing through his blood.  \n“Why did I—” \nCandice squeezed his hand and motioned for him not to stress too much. A tranquil mind and body was the road back to full health. \n“In the crash, your knife ended up in your side. You got tossed around really good, too. You lost a lot of blood, Don,” Candice said. “You needed a blood transfusion. A couple of them.” \nArchetti nodded. The severity of how gravely wounded he was took a minute to land. His brain was slacking off; everything was on seven second delay. Candice didn’t want to tell her husband how close he came to meeting his maker, but their relationship was founded on telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Candice also knew her husband would nag her until the sun went down and came up about the treatments he’d received. The irony of being in the hospital and having to “rip the bandaid off” wasn't lost on her. She would have snickered at the twisted, dark humor of it all, but Archetti was staring at her with his dark brown Krispy Kreme eyes, and the trepidation in them was palpable. \n“Reese, how’s Reese?” Archetti asked, blinking his eyes rapidly, trying to get moisture into them. Candice cocked her head to the side. \n“Who’s Reese?” she replied. \nArchetti took a profound breath; his side felt colossally inflamed, like the blade of the knife was still in there. His whole body had ranging degrees of soreness. Again, he winced in distress. \n“He was in the cruiser with me. I swear on my Aunt Elsie’s grave.”\n“Don, there was nobody with you,” Candice said. “You were the only one they pulled out.”\nAggravated, Archetti let go of his wife’s hand and scratched his temple. Candice watched in real-time as Archetti’s heart rate blipped upward on the cardiac monitor’s LED screen. \n“Don, you have to keep calm,” she said in a gentle but commanding voice. \n“Oh, fuck all that,” Archetti said. “I was driving him to the station. He pissed outside the Starbucks and—”\n“The doctor said you probably suffered a concussion,” Candice said.\n“When have I ever lied to you?” \nCandice shook her head and said, “Who would pee on a Star—”\n“It wasn’t on the actual Starbucks,” Archetti said. “He peed on the sidewalk. And he looked so sick. And not in the noggin’ sick. Like he had cancer. Something bad. I don’t know. Whatever it was, it wasn’t good.”\n“You gotta be sick in the head if you think it’s perfectly normal to whip your thing out and start rinsing off the sidewalk,” Candice said. \nArchetti’s head sank into his pillow. He sighed. Candice folded her arms, filling her cheeks with air. This wasn’t how she imagined her husband’s reentry into the cognizant realm going. It felt like she was walking on Avian Flu-contaminated eggshells, and the person who showed up from their slight coma was seventy percent of the person she married. How do I get that 30% of Don back? I know. The kids! That’ll snap him out of this sicko who tinkled on the Starbucks obsession he’s hung up on.  \n“When do you want to see the kids?” Candice asked. \nArchetti took his sweet time to answer. He was leagues deep in thought, baffled by who on the F.H.P.D. would lie to his wife. There had to be proof of Reese’s existence. That Archetti wasn’t alone in the cruiser when some idiot with his head up his ass slammed into them like a bull on steroids. Hold the fucking phone! There was proof of Resse’s existence! There was the cruiser’s dash cam. And the camera on his vest was rolling when he approached Reese. \n“I need—” \nSome knocks on the door cut off Archetti. He and Candice put on their best shit-eating grins. Archetti told the knocker to enter. The door moaned open, and the doctor walked in. She was WNBA tall, thin, and wore Wayfarer-style eyeglasses. Her hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail with streaks of bleach-blond in it.\n“I'm happy to see you awake and alert, Mr. Archetti,” she said in a decorous and upbeat voice. “I’m Doctor Block. How are you feeling?” \n“Like I got hit by a bus, Doctor.” \n\"That’s almost an accurate assessment,\" Block said with a chuckle, shifting her gaze to Candice, detecting the strained vibe in the room. \n\"Anyhoo, all your blood work came back excellent. If it weren’t for the semi-truck that ran the red light, you’d be a picture of health.” \n“It wasn’t a semi, Doc,” Archetti said. “And the light… was… green.”  \nCandice looked at Doctor Block and gave her a crooked smile. Doctor Block’s attention returned to Archetti and his testy mood. \n“We’re going to run a few more cognitive tests. Make sure your brain is firing on all cylinders,” she said. \n“You know what happens when I’m in Harveston?” Archetti asked. \nCandice interjected, directing her words to Block, “Don… he was on the F.M. Killer case,” she said. “He transferred to Franklin Hill to get away from the memories of it.” \n“I see,” Doctor Block said. \nHer patient had a history in Harveston, and it wasn’t the kind of history that makes you think of rainbows and unicorns. \n“Were you ever diagnosed with PTSD?” Block asked Archetti. \nHe hid his face in his hands, nearly pulling out the IV PICC in his arm. Archetti wanted to weep. His worst nightmare had come true. He was back in Harveston, and like the notorious F.M. Killer case, he had more questions than answers. Everyone around him (including Candice) felt aloof and foreign, as if the people in the room with him were phantoms in a Tim Burton movie. Maybe he had bled out in the cruiser, and the real Don Archetti was in a morgue in Franklin Hill with a tag tied around his big toe. Cause of death: helped man with a weak bladder. Crushed to death by a semi-truck for no good reason. But it wasn’t a fucking semi-truck! \nArchetti screamed. Candice and Doctor Block stared at him, their mouths agape. He took deep, windy breaths and said to anyone listening, “I want my phone, and I want to call Chief Nash.” \nWhat he said next flabbergasted Candice and made her contemplate the slim supernatural possibility that her spouse had his body invaded by aliens before he was pulled out of the wreck. \n“And I want to be alone,” Archetti said, insipid but stern.\n\nReese’s eyes popped open at the sound of some asshole pounding a fist against the plexiglass observation window. The man was about ten feet from the chilly steel table Reese lay upon. The asshole was dressed in a bright yellow hazmat suit, and looking at the suit stung Reese’s eyes. He went to move his arms but couldn’t. Raising his head and tucking his chin into his neck, Reese saw his arms and legs were secured to the table, leather belts around them. He tried wriggling his wrists and ankles, but the scrapping leather felt like hot coals against his pasty skin. The leg he broke in the crash was in a soft cast and hurt like a paper cut. It was annoying and persistent, but not the apocalypse.  \n“Hey!” Reese yelled at the man who was having a conniption. \nReese thought he looked like a six-foot child freaking out because his mother wouldn’t let him get a pack of SourPatchKids at the movies. The man reversed, eyes wide, and scampered to a red button on the sterile white wall. The man hit the button. An alarm blared. The shrilling banshee-like pitch sent shockwaves through Reese’s ears, and a searing pain settled in the front of his skull. \n“Turn that fucking alarm off!” Reese yelled at the top of his lungs. \nHysterical, he fought to free himself from the table as the man in the hazmat suit kept his eyes glued to the door. A group of men (also in hazmat suits) burst into the room. Reese continued to scream; it felt like a giant spider was trying to escape his body by chewing through his eye sockets. He leaned his head to the side; the hazmat men held stainless steel weapons resembling fire extinguishers. Or goddamn flamethrowers! They hastily surrounded the table like a shiver of sharks to a wounded sea lion. They aimed the whirring mouths of their shiny weapons at Reese. \n“What the holy fuck is this?!” Reese yelled, fustily kicking his good leg. \nThe trilling alarm stopped, and Reese could hear the men's breathing apparatuses. As a boy, he’d seen a movie where the main villain (a character shrouded in polished black and wearing a facemask made of metal terrified him) breathed like these men were. But Reese’s childhood fear of Darth Vader was irrational in hindsight. Reese learned the true meaning of fear the day he signed his contract with Garwarf Bio and PharmTech. \nA man with broad shoulders approached the table, unclipped the hood of his hazmat suit, and placed it on the floor. His head was shaved bald, and his icy blue eyes were intimidating in a Neo-Nazi sort of way. Sweat shined off his hairless skull, and the crow's feet around his deadly eyes ran deep. Reese figured the myriad of lines didn’t come from watching Netflix comedies and yucking it up. The lines were mortal imprints, a running tally of how much pleasure he got from performing unthinkable torture on any human belonging to Garwarf’s FOR SAMPLE PROGRAM. \nReese e-signed to be part of Garwarf’s FOR SAMPLE PROGRAM after his hoagie shop in Shamokin closed during the Covid pandemic and the government relief checks burned up faster than a buckwheat shrub in a California wildfire. Reese needed cash ASAP. Garwarf’s terms were simple: six years of documented contributions to the program, and the “associate” walked away with a check for a quarter of a million dollars. Reese watched with anguish as the bills piled up on his kitchen table. He was also late on his rent three months in a row. The program at Garwarf wasn’t the godsend Reese believed it to be.  \n“Reese, it’s nice to see you back home,” the bald psycho said. “You know you weren’t allowed to leave the research campus. It was in your contract.” \n“Fuck you, Pilsner.”\nPilsner laughed, “Is that any way to talk to the person who saved your life? I thought you’d be a little more grateful.”  \n“I know what was in the contract,” Reese said.\n“So you admit to being insubordinate,” Pilsner said. “And being of sound mind when you deliberately broke your contract with Garwarf?” \nReese nodded. I sure did, you fucking douchebag. Pilsner's gaze moved to a camera mounted in the corner of the room. He made sure Reese saw him point to it. Reese glimpsed it and stuck his tongue out. Since he couldn’t flip it off, it was the only act of chutzpah Reese had in his bag of tools. \n“We have your confession on video, Reese,” Pilsner said with a snake-in-the-grass smirk.  \n“You’ve never called me by my first name. Why now, Pilsner?”  \nPilsner gestured for his men to holster their weapons. They pushed the metallic hoses into a protracted rubbery sheath which was clipped to the side of their utility belts. Through Reese’s eyes, they were the devoted knights of an evil monarch who set their swords into their scabbards, awaiting the cue to decapitate the heretic.   \n“I saw your tape,” Pilsner said. “You lost your shit when he called you—”\n“Don’t say it!” Reese shouted.\n“Tell me, who was your friend in the bacon mobile?”\n“A nice man,” Reese said as Pilsner bent over him and pulled a penlight from his back pocket. Reese could smell his breath. Does Pilsner only eat tuna fish and garlic?  Pilsner shined the beam of white light directly into Reese’s dilated eyes. The muscles in Reese’s neck tightened as the thorny headache returned. He begged Pilsner to stop, imploring him with tears in his eyes, but Pilsner smiled heinously and dragged the penlight in methodical circles. \n“Reese, when you were back out there, in the—” \n“If you’re gonna kill me,” Reese said. “Kill me. I already have hundreds of time bombs that you dickheads put in me, but here’s the good news, if you ever have some fancy dinner with the board, be sure to tell ‘em their research center is built on Indian land. Cursed Ojibwe land. And when any fuckhead working for Gawarf leaves this earth, your soul belongs to them. They will have revenge. They always do.”\nPilsner clicked off his penlight and stared into Reese’s eyes. His eyes had no fear for the first time since joining Garwarf’s program. Pilsner placed his hand on Reese’s heart and stroked his cheek with his other hand. \n“You were a good egg, Reese Cameron. So many others would be dead by now. But there’s nothing left for you. Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall. He had a great fall. Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again,” Pilsner said, snapping his fingers. \nHe turned his back, grabbed his head cover, and walked to the door as the men armed themselves with their fire breathers. \nReese stared at the ceiling; he saw a thick crack in it. The foundation is never as solid as they think it is. Too busy focus-grouping the next Garwarf slogan, charging vacations to the company credit card, or boosting the stock with tricky math. Reese closed his eyes. Pilsner stopped at the door, raised his hand, and snapped his fingers again. Click! \nWithin seconds, the ultrahigh-temp flames rinsed the skin off Reese Cameron’s bones as Pilsner looked on from the other side of the plexiglass window. He pulled a wrinkled pack of Marlboros from his hazmat suit's breast pocket along with a Wawa lighter. He popped a bent cancer stick into his mouth, lighting it up. Minutes later, a new team entered the room. The men and women were with Garwarf’s sanitation department. They wore dark gray shirts and pants and N95 masks. The Garwarf logo was screen-printed on their shirts. An irascible Pilsner blew the smoke out his nostrils and shook his head. The shirts’ logos used to be sewn on; standards were being surrendered to the bazillions of overpaid bean counters in Plaza Building 31. Surprised, Pilsner heard Reese’s ominous last words drifting around in his head. It was a stupid coincidence, he concluded. Garwarf Bio and PharmTech were simply trimming costs on shirts. It didn't mean the rug was being yanked out from under the company’s big feet. \n\nArchetti pulled into the Wawa parking lot at 2:30 pm on a sunny, pillow-clouded day in September. It was the same Wawa he’d passed with Reese riding shotgun. The first Eagles game of the season played on his radio. They were beating the Chiefs thirteen to nothing at halftime. He got out and walked around the rear of the store. When Archetti reached the back door, he took out his phone and texted. He could see the red Wawa sign peeking out from where he stood. He watched a blue heron roost itself on the sign. It was a magnificent bird with such an inquisitive way of craning its long-beaked head. Too many of us thinking we know. Archetti cradled his phone against his shoulder and reached into his pocket, removing a bottle of pills. The police shrink had him on Ativan three times a day to cope with the recurring nightmares he was having. \nHis meetings with Chief Nash turned up zilch. According to the IT department, the footage from his cruiser and vest had been lost. They gave Archetti some runaround story about a North Korean hacker who briefly slipped into their network and stole sensitive information. The servers were shut down at the state's request until an update could be installed with an N.S.A.-certified firewall to keep foreign actors’ noses out of F.H.P.D.'s business. Archetti thought the crab cakes were rotten in Baltimore. The door opened, and a woman in her late thirties with dyed red hair and tattoos on both arms—a colorful assortment of skulls and flowers—greeted Archetti. Her name tag read Jenna Cabriano, Store Manager. Archetti eyed her hand. In it was a flash drive. \n“I could get fired for this,” Jenna said. \n“So could I.”\n“I guess we're both the filling in a shit pie then, huh?” \nArchetti smiled and nodded. That’s the idea. He removed his wallet and extracted a roll of cash. \n“They're trying to cover something up,” Archetti said. “I don’t know what—”\n“Welcome to Franklin Hill,” Jenna said, gazing at the olive-colored bills. \n“I thought when I moved here, I put the weird stuff in the past.” \nJenna held out the flash drive. Archetti took it and handed her the money. \n“You're not going to count it?” he asked. \n“Oh man, you are new around here. You’d have to be a complete horse’s ass not to pay me the amount we discussed.”\n“Why’s that?” \n“Cause I could report you to the police,” she said, flirty and mischievous. \n“Yeah. I’m a little foggy. They put me on these pills—” \n“You selling?” \nArchetti was ready to return to his car, listen to the Eagles game, and get home to his wife and kids. He and Candice had weathered the storm through all the ambiguous rubbish. He also told her more details from that night when he got home from the hospital, granular information that made it hard for Candice to believe that Archetti was fibbing. Archetti painted such a crystalline portrait of the man Reese was, not just some vagrant peeing out front of Starbucks. He was a real human being. He felt pain. He had a great-grandma with Indian blood. He’d given Archetti an abridged history lesson about the people who lived in Franklin Hill before the white world in Europe went to pot. \n“No,” Archetti said. “I’m not that kind of cop. Hey, did you watch the video from that night?” \n\tJenna’s mood turned frigid. It was a hot day, but Archetti felt the hairs on his arms peak and the goosebumps rise. Jenna took out a vape and hit it. The smoke that left her mouth smelled like menthol grapes. It reminded Archetti of a bubblegum he used to chew by the pack as a kid. Simpler times. Where did they go? Will they come back? Probably not.  \n\t“You got done dirty, dude,” Jenna said. “And trust me, it won’t be the last time. Garwarf—”\n\t“Who?”\n\t“It was a Garwarf… shit… they aren’t called trucks… like, military shit, but not a tank… the fuck they call them?”\n\t“No. No. Who is Garwarf?” Archetti said insistently. \n“Just the company that owns Franklin Hill,” Jenna said. “They sell drugs, ‘legal’ ones. I think they make vaccines, too. My mom told me they used to do all these horrible experiments on animals. Then some three-letter government agency showed up and put the kibosh on that.” \nArchetti touched the scar on his side and grasped the flash drive tightly. He felt a panic attack coming. The sudden estrangement from the ground underfoot, the sweaty palms, his mouth going dry as cardboard. \n“You alright?” Jenna asked. “You don’t look so hot.” \n\t“I’ll be fine, thanks,” Archetti said. “I appreciate you doing this for me.”\n            “No worries,” Jenna said. “Times are hard. Look at those gas prices. And I got two mouths to feed. But the taxman can’t see cash, right?”\n\tArchetti returned to his car and stared at the flash drive in his hand, setting it in the cup holder. He’d Google Garwarf when he got home. Archetti powered his window down and leaned his head out. His eyes fell on the Wawa sign. He hoped the blue heron, a bird that had been a pterodactyl at some point in its transition, would still be there. Marshall loved dinosaurs, and Ava thought certain birds were pretty. Snapping a picture of a blue heron chilling on a Wawa sign with his iPhone didn’t feel so anomalous as it should have. \nAfter Harveston and the mystery of Reese Cameron, it felt like one and one finally making two again. Archetti had a win-win on his hands. But the feathered creature had moved along. \nHe sighed, leering at the sign and cursing through gritted teeth. His eyebrows lowered, and he squinted; the sign was moving, wobbling ever so slightly in the still air. There wasn’t even a light breeze. Boom! Across the street, a telephone pole toppled over and splintered when it hit the concrete. Long pieces of serrated wood caused cars, trucks, and SUVs to skid sideways, their brakes screaming for mercy. The crunching of Chinese-made bumpers colliding was everywhere. Inside Archetti’s car, the steering wheel shook in his hands, and the loose change in the cupholders clattered about like a heavy metal concert.\n Archetti watched in helpless horror as people sprinted into the Wawa for safety. He saw racks stocked to the brim with chips and pretzels spill to the floor. Franklin Hill was having an earthquake, a formidable one. Archetti pulled out his iPhone and Facetimed Candice. She answered. Archetti’s screen was like watching a found footage horror movie while riding a wooden roller coaster. And keeping himself in frame was enough to make anyone vomit. The connection was spotty, with pixelated squares and offensive lines of RGB-colored interference corrupting the screen. He told Candice he loved her and told her to tell the kids he loved them. Then, the world went still. The earthquake was over. Archetti could hear the wail of sirens singing all around him. He clicked off the Facetime with Candice and stared at the flash drive in the cup holder.   \nArchetti hugged his wife and kids when he stepped through the front door. He kissed Candice on the lips in a way that he would know her taste forever. In the kitchen, Archetti grabbed two bottles of Yuengling—both were for him. On his way out of the kitchen, he took the bottle of Ativan from his pocket and put it inside the microwave. Candice didn’t say anything and was relieved he didn’t hit the power button. Archetti trudged into the living room, sat in his favorite chair, and turned on the TV. He wanted to watch the end of the Eagles game, but the local news was covering the “devastating aftermath” of the earthquake. \nThe news chopper zoomed in on the Starbucks on N. Center Street. A broad and deep chasm had opened below the sign, and fissures, like thin sprigs, devastated the sidewalk and the street. Archetti, taking a sip of his beer, instantly recognized the spot where the most expansive crater was. It was where Reese Cameron, on that demure and fetching night in June, had pissed on the sidewalk.\n"},"434":{"title":"I've return (A Pokémon Go Creepypasta)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhurzv\/ive_return_a_pokémon_go_creepypasta\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TheJboy2002","selftext":"(Creepypasta) I was playing pokémon Go one night things seems fine until around 3am when all the Pokémon disappeared and strange music started playing replacing the original I recognize the music tho it was lavender town when all of a sudden this strange looking pokémon showed up I clicked on him the name was missingno there was red text everywhere saying I've return I've return then my phone turned off when I turned it on I opened pokémon go I noticed the map was dark lavender town still playing I looked at my pokémon and they were all dead except one Missingno."},"435":{"title":"My Precious Little Boy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhq3ny\/my_precious_little_boy\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"JosephTheSnail","selftext":"Eric, my precious little boy.\n\nJust look at those precious eyes!

There’s something about the quiet that helps me think, unwind, maybe even get a little work done when the world has finally gone to sleep. At least, that’s how I used to feel about it. Now, I dread the late hours.\n\nIt was about a year ago, in late October. I was up late as usual, finishing up some paperwork for my job. My apartment is in a pretty safe part of town—small neighborhood, friendly neighbors, the kind of place you don’t really think twice about. I had my windows cracked open just a bit to let the cool air in, the kind of breeze that makes everything feel a little cozier inside.\n\nIt must’ve been around 2 a.m. when I heard it.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nAt first, I didn’t think much of it. Maybe it was a tree branch or something. I went back to my work, but then I heard it again, louder this time.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nIt was coming from the window right next to my desk.\n\nI froze. It wasn’t windy, and there were no trees close enough to my window to reach it. The tapping was deliberate, like someone was testing to see if I would notice. I looked over, expecting to see a bird or maybe some animal, but there was nothing—just the thin curtains fluttering with the breeze.\n\nBut then it came again. *Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nThis time, it was slow, almost rhythmic, like someone was waiting for me to answer.\n\nNow, I’ve always been a rational person. I told myself it was just a weird coincidence, maybe the pipes or something. Still, I got up and looked out the window, carefully peeling the curtain back.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe streetlights cast a dim glow over the empty sidewalk outside, and everything was still. But something didn’t feel right. You know that sensation when you *know* someone’s watching you? It felt like that, like eyes were on me, but there was no one there.\n\nI shook it off, convinced myself I was just tired, and sat back down at my desk. I kept working, but I couldn’t shake the unease. Every now and then, I’d glance at the window, half-expecting something to be standing there, staring in at me.\n\nAnd then, the tapping started again.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nThis time, it was louder, more urgent. My heart started racing, but I forced myself to look out the window again. I pulled the curtain back quickly, hoping to catch whatever—or whoever—was there.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe street was still empty, and my yard was just as I’d left it. But this time, I noticed something I hadn’t before. In the corner of my window, right where the tapping had been, were faint smudges. Like someone had pressed their fingers against the glass. Three distinct smudges. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nI started to get a little freaked out at this point. I closed the window, locked it, and pulled the curtains shut. Whatever it was, I wasn’t about to give it an audience. I double-checked all my other windows and doors, making sure everything was locked, and sat back down, my heart pounding.\n\nBut then, just as I started to calm down, I heard it again.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nOnly this time, it wasn’t coming from the window.\n\nIt was coming from the other side of the room. I turned around slowly, my stomach dropping as I did.\n\nI have a second window in my living room, one that faces the back of the apartment, where there’s nothing but a narrow alley and a tall fence. It was shut, locked, and the curtains were drawn, but the tapping was coming from there now.\n\nI didn’t want to look, but I had to. I crept over to the window, feeling the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The tapping was steady, insistent, like someone—or something—was just waiting for me to respond.\n\nI yanked the curtains open and looked out, expecting to see nothing again.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nStanding in the alley, just beyond the fence, was a figure. I couldn’t make out any details, just the shape of someone tall, too tall to be normal. They were standing completely still, their face hidden in the shadows. But the worst part? Their hand was raised, slowly tapping against the window with long, thin fingers that shouldn’t have been able to reach that high.\n\nI stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call the police—I mean, what was I supposed to say? “Someone’s tapping on my window”? They wouldn’t take me seriously.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could think of. I turned off all the lights, grabbed my phone, and sat in the corner of the room, watching the window from the shadows. The tapping continued, steady and slow, like it knew I was still there.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\nIt went on for what felt like hours, but in reality, it was probably only a few minutes. And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. I waited, holding my breath, listening for any sign of movement outside.\n\nNothing.\n\nEventually, I worked up the nerve to peek out the window again.\n\nThe figure was gone.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. Or the next night. In fact, I haven’t slept well since. I don’t leave my windows open anymore, not even a crack. I don’t stay up late either. But sometimes, late at night, when the house is quiet, I swear I can still hear it.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap.*\n\n---\n\n\n\n"},"437":{"title":"Scary videos in YouTube","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhbsk4\/scary_videos_in_youtube\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Vlad_Glad_6025","selftext":"Hello everyone.

The city was unusually quiet, the mist swallowing sound and muting the neon lights that flickered above closed storefronts. I stuffed my hands deeper into my pockets, the anticipation building inside me. It was Eric's idea to come out here, to find the infamous diner that only opened at night. I wasn’t convinced it was a good idea, but curiosity gnawed at me.\n\n\"What's the deal with this place again?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper, though I couldn't say why. Maybe it was the fog, or the unsettling silence around us.\n\nEric shot me a grin, his breath visible in the cold air. \"Rumor has it the diner opens at exactly 10 PM and closes before dawn. Some people say it's older than the city itself.\" He paused for effect. \"And, of course, the rules.\"\n\nThe rules. That's what everyone talked about. Online forums, late-night campus discussions, and even random whispers at parties. The 10 PM Diner's rules were legendary, each more bizarre than the last. Yet despite all the speculation, no one seemed to know why they existed or who enforced them. Some said it was just a quirky tradition to attract business. Others hinted at something darker, a power that the diner held over its patrons.\n\n\"You think it's just a gimmick?\" I asked, trying to sound casual.\n\n\"Probably,\" Eric replied. \"But isn't that part of the fun? Come on, where’s your sense of adventure?\"\n\nI forced a smile, more to convince myself than him. The idea of the rules didn’t sit right with me. But then again, how weird could a diner really be? We turned a corner and the building came into view. It sat at the end of a darkened alleyway, wedged between two ancient brick structures.\n\n“There it is,” Eric said, nodding toward the dim glow ahead.\n\nThe diner’s façade was cracked and faded, its windows fogged up from the warmth inside. The only sign of life was a flickering neon sign above the entrance, casting a sickly yellow light onto the wet pavement. As we approached, I noticed a faint outline of people through the grime-streaked glass. My stomach tightened.\n\n“You ready?” Eric asked, grabbing the door handle.\n\nI hesitated for a split second, glancing at the street behind us. The fog seemed thicker now, swallowing everything in its path. It felt like the world was closing in on us. I took a deep breath and nodded. “Yeah, let’s do this.”\n\nEric pulled the door open, and we stepped inside. A wave of warm, stale air hit me, carrying with it the scent of old leather, coffee, and a faint hint of something metallic. The interior was dimly lit, casting long shadows across the checkered floor. I scanned the room, trying to get my bearings. Booths lined the walls, their red leather cushions cracked and worn with age. A long counter stretched out on the opposite side, stools with torn fabric tops lined up neatly.\n\nThere were a few customers scattered around: a man sitting by himself, staring at the window; an elderly couple whispering over their cups; and a lone woman with her back to us, spooning sugar into her drink in a slow, methodical manner. But what struck me the most was how still everything seemed. The other patrons barely moved, their actions sluggish, like they were part of some strange, slow-motion dream.\n\nI glanced at Eric, who appeared to have noticed it too. His usual bravado seemed to wane slightly as we walked toward an empty booth in the center of the room. The seats squeaked under our weight as we sat down. Eric, always one for theatrics, leaned forward and whispered, “Okay, this place is officially creepy.”\n\n“Yeah, no kidding,” I replied, my eyes scanning the room again. Something about the diner made my skin crawl, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. It was as if the place itself was watching us.\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by the silent arrival of a waitress. She appeared seemingly out of nowhere, placing two menus on the table without so much as a word. Her movements were smooth, almost robotic, and she left as quickly as she had come. Eric raised an eyebrow at me, clearly unnerved.\n\n“Well, that was... something,” he muttered. “Guess we’re not getting the warm and friendly service tonight.”\n\nI picked up the menu, my curiosity piqued. It felt old, the plastic cover worn and sticky to the touch. Then, I noticed the writing on the front, bold, black letters spelling out “House Rules.” Beneath the title was a list of numbered instructions, each one stranger than the last.\n\n\n\nRULE 1: Never sit facing the entrance unless you are the first customer to arrive.\n\nRULE 2: Never greet the staff when they approach; only speak when spoken to.\n\nRULE 3: If a stranger joins your table uninvited, offer them a sip of your drink, then excuse yourself to the restroom. Return only when the diner clock chimes.\n\nRULE 4: If you hear soft humming while eating, immediately close your eyes and wait for the humming to stop.\n\nRULE 5: If a waiter drops something, you must turn away and not look at them until they leave your table.\n\nRULE 6: If you hear your name whispered from behind, do not turn around. Pretend you did not hear it.\n\nRULE 7: Should your utensil fall, leave it there. Do not bend down to pick it up, or you risk seeing something under the table that shouldn’t be there.\n\nRULE 8: If you hear footsteps following you as you leave, do not turn around. Slow your pace until the sound fades away.\n\n\n\nI read through the list twice, each rule more unsettling than the one before. My mouth went dry as I realized how specific they were. These weren't rules for a quaint diner experience. They were warnings. My eyes darted back to Rule 1: Never sit facing the entrance unless you are the first customer to arrive. A chill ran down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the glass door.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Eric whispered, pointing at Rule 4. \"If you hear soft humming while eating, close your eyes? What is this place, a haunted house?\"\n\nI forced a laugh, but my heart wasn't in it. \"It's probably just some elaborate gimmick,\" I said, trying to convince myself. \"You know, to get people talking.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right,\" Eric replied, his voice tinged with skepticism. \"Well, we came here for the experience. Let's just roll with it.\" He looked at me, waiting for some kind of agreement.\n\nI nodded, feeling a tight knot of anxiety form in my chest. We flipped open the menus and pretended to browse the food options, though neither of us really had an appetite. My eyes kept drifting back to the rules, especially Rule 1.\n\n\"Wait,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"We weren’t the first ones here, and...\" I trailed off, glancing at the door. Through the grimy glass, something moved. I couldn’t make it out clearly, just a dark silhouette shifting in and out of the foggy night. It was tall, unnaturally so, and seemed to sway as it stood there. I blinked, trying to focus, but it faded into the darkness.\n\n\"What?\" Eric asked, leaning forward. \"What did you see?\"\n\n\"There's... something out there,\" I muttered, not taking my eyes off the door. \"I don't know what it was, but it looked\"\n\n\"Don't mess with me,\" he interrupted, his voice strained. \"This place is already creepy enough.\"\n\n\"I'm not messing with you,\" I snapped, turning back to face him. \"I swear I saw something.\"\n\nWe both went silent, the unease between us growing thicker. The rules weren’t a joke. I was sure of it now. This place had its own set of laws, its own way of operating, and we were already violating one.\n\nThe tension between us grew thicker with each passing second. I kept glancing at the entrance, scanning for any sign of movement through the glass. My mind replayed the brief glimpse of that shadowy figure I had seen outside, and an icy fear gripped my chest. Eric shifted nervously across from me, tapping his fingers on the table.\n\nWe sat there in silence, waiting. The waitress reappeared, sliding up to our table without a sound, her hollow eyes staring straight through us. My skin crawled at the sight of her. Remembering Rule 2, I bit my tongue and stared at the menu in front of me, resisting the urge to greet her or even acknowledge her presence. Eric’s eyes widened as if he had to force himself to stay quiet.\n\nAfter a long, unsettling pause, the waitress finally spoke, her voice monotone and distant. “What would you like to order?” She didn’t ask it like a question, more like a command. The words felt cold and wrong, echoing strangely in the air around us. It was as if the sound didn’t belong in this place.\n\nEric coughed and glanced at me, seeking some form of validation. I nodded subtly, indicating he should answer first. He took a deep breath and said, \"I’ll have a black coffee and... pancakes.\" His voice trembled slightly, but he managed to get the words out.\n\nThe waitress turned her gaze to me, her eyes boring into mine like a predator assessing its prey. I swallowed hard, forcing myself to meet her eyes for only a moment before I replied, \"Same for me, please.\"\n\nShe didn't react, didn’t even blink. She just scribbled something onto her notepad and turned to leave. As she walked away, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief, as though a great weight had lifted off my chest. I exhaled slowly, my heartbeat gradually returning to a more regular rhythm.\n\n“That was... weird,” Eric muttered, breaking the silence between us. “Did you see how she looked at us?”\n\nI nodded, rubbing my hands together to warm them. “Yeah, like she was judging us for even being here,” I replied, keeping my voice low. “And the way she spoke, it was like she didn’t care what we ordered. Almost like it didn’t matter.”\n\nWe sat in silence for a few minutes, staring at each other, too afraid to voice the questions racing through our minds. We both knew something wasn’t right. This place felt wrong, like it was bending reality in subtle ways, making us question our perceptions.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the waitress returned with our orders. She placed the coffee cups and plates in front of us with meticulous precision, her movements almost robotic. “Enjoy your meal,” she intoned before turning on her heel and drifting back to the shadows.\n\n“Did you hear that?” Eric whispered, leaning closer to me. “She said ‘enjoy your meal.’ It’s like she was forcing herself to say it.”\n\nI nodded, my eyes locked on the steaming cup of coffee in front of me. I had an overwhelming urge to down the coffee and leave, to get as far away from this diner as possible. But something inside me, perhaps morbid curiosity, kept me rooted in my seat. I picked up my fork and prodded at the pancakes, watching the syrup ooze slowly down the sides.\n\nThen it started.\n\nA soft, melodic humming filled the air around us. My heart skipped a beat as I remembered Rule 4: If you hear soft humming while eating, immediately close your eyes and wait for the humming to stop.\n\n“Eric,” I hissed, grabbing his wrist. His eyes widened in alarm as he, too, began to hear the sound. “Close your eyes. Now.”\n\n“What?” he stammered, his fork frozen in mid-air.\n\n“Just do it!” I snapped, shutting my own eyes tightly. I heard Eric mutter a curse before he followed suit.\n\nThe humming grew louder, swelling into a haunting lullaby that reverberated through my skull. It was everywhere, in the air, in my ears, inside my own head. My grip on the fork tightened until my knuckles turned white. I kept my eyes squeezed shut, trying to focus on anything but the unnerving sound.\n\nI felt a cold presence sweep through the room, like a gust of wind in an enclosed space. My skin prickled, and the air grew thick and suffocating. Every instinct screamed at me to open my eyes, to look at what was happening around us, but I knew that would break the rule. I had to stay still. I had to endure.\n\nThe humming seemed to circle our table, changing in pitch and rhythm as if it was studying us, trying to coax us into making a mistake. My breathing grew ragged, my chest tightening with fear. I wanted to reach out to Eric, to feel some form of connection, but I was too afraid to move.\n\nThen, as abruptly as it had begun, the humming ceased. I held my breath, waiting, listening. I heard Eric’s shaky breathing beside me, but no other sound disturbed the air.\n\n“It’s over,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “I think we can open our eyes now.”\n\nI hesitated, then slowly cracked my eyes open. The diner was exactly as it had been before, but it felt different, colder, darker. I glanced at Eric, who looked as pale as a ghost. His eyes were wide, darting around the room in a panic.\n\n“Did you feel that?” he asked, his voice trembling. “It was like... like something was right here.”\n\n“Yeah,” I replied, my mouth dry. I glanced at the other patrons, expecting to see them staring at us, judging us for our fear. But they all sat motionless, eating their meals as if nothing had happened.\n\nI glanced down at my plate, my appetite completely gone. The pancakes looked wrong somehow, grayer, like the color had drained from them. I pushed the plate away, my stomach churning.\n\n“Let’s get out of here,” Eric muttered, his eyes darting nervously to the entrance. “I don’t care about the rules anymore. I want to leave.”\n\nI opened my mouth to agree when the waitress returned, appearing silently at the edge of our table. My heart nearly stopped. Rule 2, I reminded myself. Don’t speak unless spoken to. I clamped my mouth shut and waited, my heart pounding in my ears.\n\n“Would you like anything else?” she asked, her voice devoid of emotion.\n\nI shook my head, avoiding her gaze. She lingered for a moment, her presence sending a chill down my spine, before turning away and gliding back to the counter.\n\n“Okay, that’s it,” Eric whispered harshly. “We’re leaving. Now.”\n\nI nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. As we prepared to stand up, I glanced at the menu again, my eyes catching the list of rules. Rule 8 loomed in my mind like a warning: If you hear footsteps following you as you leave, do not turn around. Slow your pace until the sound fades away.\n\nWe weren’t done yet. The worst was yet to come.\n\nEric stood up abruptly, his chair scraping loudly against the floor, cutting through the oppressive silence that hung in the diner. \n\nA sense of dread washed over me. There was a nagging feeling that we were far from done with this place. Eric reached for his wallet, tossing a few bills onto the table. \"Let’s just go,\" he muttered under his breath, his eyes wide and darting toward the entrance. He wanted out, and so did I.\n\nWe started walking toward the door, the air around us seeming to thicken with every step. My legs felt heavy, as though I were wading through mud. The soft clinking of cutlery and hushed murmurs of the other patrons filled the space, but my senses were hyper-focused on our escape. Then, just as we were a few feet from the door, I heard it, the distinct scrape of a chair behind us.\n\nMy heart dropped. Someone had joined our table.\n\nI glanced at Eric, whose face had gone ghostly white. \"Oh no,\" he whispered, barely audible over the diner's eerie ambiance. \"Rule 3...\"\n\nSlowly, I turned back to look. There, sitting in my seat, was a tall, lanky figure. The man wore an old-fashioned suit, the kind you’d see in pictures from decades past. His head was bent forward, his hair hanging over his face like a dark curtain, obscuring his features. A wave of cold swept over me; the atmosphere around him felt wrong, as if he didn’t belong in this world.\n\n\"We have to follow the rule,\" I hissed at Eric, trying to keep my voice steady. \"Get back to the table. Now.\"\n\nWith reluctance, we approached the stranger. He remained utterly still, his head angled forward as if studying something invisible on the table. The room seemed to grow darker, colder, the air pressing down on my chest. My palms were slick with sweat, and I could feel my pulse pounding in my throat.\n\nI grabbed my cup of coffee, my hand trembling, and placed it in front of the stranger. \"Here,\" I managed to say, my voice barely a whisper. \"Have a sip.\"\n\nHis hand moved in slow, deliberate motions as he reached for the cup. His fingers were unnaturally long and thin, with skin that seemed almost translucent. He lifted the cup to his lips, taking a slow, deliberate sip. A chill crawled up my spine, and I fought the urge to look away.\n\n\"Restroom,\" I croaked, nudging Eric. \"We need to go.\"\n\nEric nodded, his eyes locked on the stranger. We backed away from the table, careful not to break eye contact until we reached the restroom door. The moment we were inside, we both exhaled, as though we had just come up for air after being submerged in dark water.\n\n\"What the hell was that?\" Eric rasped, clutching the edge of the sink. \"Who was that guy?\"\n\n\"I don’t know,\" I replied, my voice shaky. \"But we had to follow the rule. Now we wait until the clock chimes.\"\n\nSeconds felt like minutes as we stood there, listening to our own ragged breaths echoing in the tiny room. My mind raced, trying to process what had just happened. The air was stifling, pressing down on us as if the diner itself was alive, watching our every move.\n\nThen, the café clock outside began to chime. One… two… three chimes. We exchanged a glance, swallowing the lump of fear lodged in our throats. It was time to return.\n\nAs we stepped out of the restroom, we dared to approach the table. It was empty. The stranger was gone, leaving only our two cups and the uneaten plates of pancakes behind.  I exhaled shakily, but my relief was short-lived.\n\nAs we turned back toward the entrance, something metallic clattered against the floor. I froze. My fork had fallen, clinking loudly as it hit the ground, spinning a few times before settling just under the table.\n\nI felt my heart leap into my throat. Rule 7: Should your utensil fall, leave it there. Do not bend down to pick it up, or you risk seeing something under the table that shouldn’t be there.\n\n\"Leave it,\" I whispered urgently to Eric, who was staring wide-eyed at the fork. \"Don't look under the table.\"\n\nHe nodded, but his eyes were wide with fear. I could feel the tension radiating off him, his body rigid and tense. We were both aware of what Rule 7 warned us about, and yet the urge to look was almost unbearable, like an itch in the back of my mind that I couldn’t scratch.\n\nThen we heard it, a soft, muffled sound coming from beneath the table. My blood ran cold. It was the faint, heart-wrenching sobs of a child, crying softly in the darkness beneath us. My stomach twisted violently, and I had to grip the edge of the table to keep from collapsing.\n\n\"Don't listen,\" I muttered through clenched teeth, my eyes fixed on a point far away. \"It's not real. Just focus.\"\n\nThe crying grew louder, more desperate, echoing in the small space of the diner. It was the kind of sound that clawed at your heart, demanding your attention. Tears welled up in my eyes, not from sadness but from sheer terror. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to drown out the noise. But the cries persisted, coming in waves of anguish and despair, each one stronger than the last.\n\nEric shifted uncomfortably beside me. \"It’s... It’s just a trick,\" he whispered, more to himself than to me. \"We can’t look. We can't.\"\n\nThe cries turned into words, garbled and barely recognizable but unmistakably pleading. \"Please... help... me...\" The voice tugged at the deepest recesses of my sympathy, igniting an instinct to look, to bend down and see who, or what, was under there.\n\nI clenched my fists so tightly that my nails dug into my palms. \"It's not real,\" I repeated, my voice trembling. \"It's just trying to make us look.\"\n\nThe crying continued, now mixed with small, shuffling sounds like tiny feet dragging across the floor. My skin crawled, every nerve screaming for me to glance down and see what was beneath the table. I felt like I was losing my grip on reality, the line between what was real and what wasn’t blurring under the pressure of the noise.\n\nThen, a tiny hand wrapped around the leg of my chair. I stiffened, my muscles locking up in paralyzing fear. It gripped tightly, almost urgently, as though begging me to help. My heart raced so fast I thought it might burst, my breath coming out in short, panicked gasps.\n\n\"Don’t look!\" I hissed to Eric, fighting the urge to jump up and run. \"It’s not real.\"\n\nThe grip on my chair tightened, and the crying turned into a pitiful wail. My eyes burned from the effort of not looking down, of not acknowledging the nightmare unfolding beneath us. I could feel my sanity teetering on the edge, about to break.\n\nAnd then, as abruptly as it had started, it stopped.\n\nThe hand released its grip, the crying faded into silence, and the air around us returned to its suffocating stillness. I dared to glance at Eric, who was pale and shaking, his eyes wide and haunted.\n\n\"Did... did you see that?\" he croaked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI nodded, swallowing hard. \"Yeah. But we didn't look under the table. We followed the rule.\"\n\nHe exhaled shakily, his hands still gripping the edge of the table. \"Let's get out of here,\" he muttered, his voice strained. \"I can't take this anymore.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I replied, feeling a wave of nausea wash over me. We stood up slowly, careful not to glance under the table as we backed away. I couldn't help but notice that the rest of the diner continued on as if nothing had happened, the patrons still eating, the waitress still standing behind the counter with her hollow stare.\n\nWe started toward the exit, moving cautiously. As we reached the door, I heard it, a faint, distant whisper of footsteps following us. My body tensed, remembering Rule 8: If you hear footsteps following you as you leave, do not turn around. Slow your pace until the sound fades away.\n\n\"Don't turn around,\" I warned Eric, my voice strained. \"Just walk slowly.\"\n\nWe moved forward, each step heavy with fear as the footsteps echoed behind us. I fought every instinct to look back, to see what was trailing us. But I knew if we did, we’d break the rule, and whatever awaited us on the other side of that broken rule would be far worse than anything we had encountered so far.\n\nThe door was just a few feet away. My hand reached out, grasping the cold handle, and I pushed it open. The footsteps stopped as we crossed the threshold into the foggy night. I turned to Eric, both of us breathing heavily, our faces pale and drawn.\n\n\"Let's go,\" I muttered, my voice barely holding together. \"And never come back.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street, the diner's oppressive aura fading behind us. Neither of us spoke, too afraid of what we might say, of what might still be lingering in the air around us.\n\nAs we rounded the corner, I chanced a final glance back. The diner stood silent, its dim neon sign flickering in the fog. For a moment, I thought I saw a shadow at the window, staring out, watching us.\n\nI looked away and quickened my pace. Whatever had happened in there, I knew one thing for certain: we were never coming back.\n\n"},"442":{"title":"Jeff the killer rewritten (and hopefully better)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhm0f5\/jeff_the_killer_rewritten_and_hopefully_better\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Frost_By_te_","selftext":"Jeffrey Woods was fifteen years old when he moved in with his family to a new neighborhood. His father had gotten a new job and they decided to move closer to his employers office. Jeff and his little brother, Liu, missed their old house. However, they didn’t really mind moving. Their new house was, in their words, “fancy.” When Jeff’s family got to their house and finished unpacking, their new neighbor came to greet them.\n\n“Hello there, I’m Barbara. I just came over to welcome you all to the neighborhood.”\n\n“Thanks, said Jeff's mother, I’m Margaret, this is my husband Peter, and these are my two sons, Jeff and Liu.”\n\n“Oh, aren’t they cute? I have a son too. He’s in the backyard.” She turned to her house.\n\n“Billy! Come and meet the neighbors!” Billy came over and said hi, then he went back to play in his backyard.\n\n“He’s adorable.” said Margaret\n\n“You know, Billy is having a birthday party soon, so why don’t you come over? We can have a chat, the kids can play, and if they become friends, they can come to the party.”\n\n“Sounds like a plan! See you later.” Said Peter.\n\nJeff started complaining, he really didn’t want to go to “some dumb kid’s party.”\n\n“Jeff,” said Jeff’s mom, “we just moved here, we should show that we want to be friendly with our neighbors.”\n\nJeff, grunting, went to his room, and plopped down on the bed, humming his favourite song, “I don’t want to set the world on fire.” And suddenly, he got a weird feeling. Not so much pain, but something else harder to explain.\n\nAfter unpacking, the family went to Barbara’s house. Liu became good friends with Billy, and they decided to join Billy’s birthday.\n\nThe next day, Jeff went down to eat breakfast and get ready for school. After going outside with Liu behind him, he got another feeling, this time a slight tugging pain. Suddenly a boy on a skateboard came in front of the house, followed by another two kids. All three of them were a few years older than Jeff.\n\n“Hello there, you both must be new. Allow me to introduce ourselves. He’s Keith.”\n\nKeith was a skinny boy who had dark hair and a dopey face.\n\n“And that’s Troy.” Troy was a fat kid with brown hair and dark limbal rings.\n\n“And I’m Randy.” He looked like hadn’t gotten any sleep that day. He wore an Aeropostale shirt and ripped blue jeans.\n\n“Now, for all the kids in this neighborhood, there is a small price for bus fare, if you catch my drift.” Liu stood up, ready to punch the kid when Troy grabbed him from the collar. “Tsk, tsk, tsk, I had hoped you would be more cooperative, but it seems we have to do this the hard way.” Randy walked up to Liu and took his wallet out of his pocket. Jeff started to get angry, and went over to Randy.\n\n“Listen here, you better give me back Liu’s wallet.”\n\n“Or what will you do, you pillock?”\n\nAt that point, Jeff felt that feeling. A sudden surge violence enveloped his mind. He then punched Randy in the nose, and quickly followed with a low kick. As Randy rolled on the ground in pain, Keith lashed out at Jeff, grabbed him, and started kicking him. Liu, panicking, punched Troy in the stomach and Troy fell to the ground. After he freed himself, Liu ran to help Jeff, and kicked Randy in the ankle. Then he grabbed Keith and broke his wrist. Keith screamed, tears running down his cheeks.\n\n“Jeff, are you ok?” was all he said. They saw the bus coming and knew they’d be blamed for the whole thing. So they started running as fast as they could. As they ran, they looked back and saw the bus driver rushing over to Randy and the others. As Jeff and Liu made it to school, they didn’t dare tell what happened. However, Jeff couldn’t help but feel good after the fight, even though he dismissed it as adrenaline. He felt that strange feeling go away, and stay away for the entire day of school. Even as he walked home due to the whole thing near the bus stop, given that he didn’t want to take the bus, he felt happy. When he got home his parents asked him how his day was, and he said “It was a wonderful day.” When he got home from school on Friday, his mom, looking worried, was talking with two police officers.\n\n“Jeff, would you care to explain what happened here?”\n\n“What's happening?” Said Jeff.\n\n“Son, witnesses reported that they saw you and another kid getting into a fight with 3 more teenagers. One had a broken wrist, one with a stomach wound, and the other with a bruised nose and ankle. Now, can you explain to us what happened?”\n\n“Th-th-they were the ones who tried to steal from Liu, and even menaced us.”\n\n“That may be true, said one of the officers, but the wounds were pretty severe, so unfortunately you can’t go out clean. You’re gonna have to spend some time in juvenile hall.”\n\nLiu, hearing this, ran downstairs in tears, holding a knife.\n\n“Officers, I did it. I was the one who beat them up, and I have the marks to prove it.” \n\nAnd he then opened his sleeve to reveal cuts and bruises. But Jeff knew what he did, and felt the urge to sob, since he thought he heard crying from upstairs. But his parents and the officers didn’t.\n\n“Woah kid, put down the knife.” Said one of the officers.\n\n“NO! He started crying. I won’t, not until you let my brother go.”\n\n“Put, the, knife, down, kid.”\n\nLiu then rushed towards the other police officer and started trying to stab him while crying heavily. He fell to the ground screaming and sobbing “Take me away! I did it.” The officers talked to each other for a bit, and then grabbed Liu from the arms and put him in his car.\n\n“Kid, we’re sorry, but a few years in juvie will do you good.”\n\nJeff did not show any emotion. He couldn’t show any emotion. But he was incredibly sad. And simply went up to his room. During the months following, turning into one full year, Jeff became a very introverted child and didn’t really go to school at all. He only studied by taking online school. He did get over his brother getting sent to juvie.\n\nHowever one day, his mom woke him up in the morning. She had a very happy look on her face.\n\n“Mom? What is it?”\n\n“Jeff, guess what? The neighbors have invited us to their house for a party.”\n\n“And why the hell should I care.”\n\n“Come on Jeff, you might even have fun if you come with us.”“Ugh, fine.”\n\nAs Jeff got dressed after eating breakfast, he went down to tell his mom he was ready.\n\n“JEFF, come on, get dressed properly. You know, fancy.” He grunted and went back up to his room.\n\n“I DON’T HAVE ANY FANCY CLOTHES, MOM!”\n\n“JUST PUT ON SOMETHING!” Said his mom.\n\nAfter a while, Jeff came back down wearing a white pullover, and black jeans.\n\n“Well, better than nothing, let’s go.”\n\nWhen they got to the party, Jeff decided to play with the kids. It may not have been super cool, but he had fun anyway. However, Jeff then heard a noise. It was the sound of a skateboard wheel. Suddenly, Jeff saw them again, Randy, Troy and Keith. They had come to the house hoping to find Jeff. \n\n“Hello there Jeff. We meet again.”\n\n“Shut up! You’re the last person I want to see. You got my brother sent to Juvie.”\n\n“It was HIS FAULT DUMBASS!” Shouted Randy.\n\n“Shut up, shut UP, SHUT UP! I’LL PUMMEL YOU TO THE GROUND!”\n\nAnd Jeff rushed towards Randy. Randy punched Jeff in the nose, and Jeff grabbed him by the ears and head-butted him. Jeff pushed Randy off of him and both rose to their feet. Kids were screaming and parents were running out of the house, trying to reassure their children. Randy pulled out a switchblade and stabbed Jeff in the shoulder. Jeff fell to the ground, as Randy started kicking him in the ribs, as blood gushed down from his shoulder. He suddenly stopped while Jeff was crying on the lawn, his white shirt stained red.\n\n“Jeff, you disappoint me. I don’t want to see you ever again. Tell that to your parents, anyway, that bunch of wimps’ll probably do whatever for the good of their poor excuse of a son.”\n\nAnd at that moment, Jeff got the same feeling from the first time he met Randy. But this time, it wasn’t adrenaline, it was insanity. No more feelings, no more emotions, except aggression. Jeff grabbed the knife from his shoulder and pulled it out, without a sound, nor a face expression. He then plunged the knife in his ankle repeatedly. Jab after jab after jab, with Jeff laughing at the sight of his blood.\n\n“That’s IT!” Said Randy. He grabbed Jeff’s head and stuck it on a grill, setting the flame to the maximum. Jeff was now screaming at the top of his lungs. Randy saw a jug of bleach and started pouring it on Jeff’s head. The flames grew, and grew and grew, until Jeff stopped struggling. Randy dropped him onto the ground. He was breathing, but he didn’t move at all. Troy and Keith were looking at Randy, in shock. They had come to beat him up, not almost kill him. The police had finally arrived and grabbed Randy.\n\n“Sorry kid, you’re going away.”\n\nAs they put Randy in the police car, an ambulance arrived to get Jeff.\n\nA few days later, Jeff woke up in a hospital, but he only saw pitch black, because there was a cast on his face. He could barely move and he felt a tube inside his arm.\n\n“Jeff, honey? Are you okay? Guess what, after we told the police what happened, they decided to let your brother go.”\n\nJeff, excited, wanted to jump out of his bed. But then again he couldn’t move. ANd even if he tried, he would only hurt his shoulder, since after the stab, there was a bandage on it so it could heal.\n\n“Don’t worry honey, you just need to rest.”\n\nThe next couple of weeks were those where Jeff was visited by his family. Then came the day where his bandages were to be removed. His family members, including Liu, were all there to see it. As the doctors unwrapped the bandages from Jeff’s face everyone was on the edge of their seats. They waited until the last bandage holding the cover over his face was almost removed.\n\nAs the bandage fell, they were shocked.\n\n“So, what do you all think?” Asked Jeff, his smile fading as he saw his family, shocked at the sight of his face.\n\n“Why don’t you look in the mirror, honey?”\n\nAs he looked in the mirror, he started laughing. Then he laughed harder, and harder until he almost hurt his rib. He was still laughing, nervously, while feeling his face. It was soot white and had a sort of soft, leathery feel to it. His laugh fell to crying.\n\n“My, my face.” He started sobbing. “My face is, it’s, it’s…” He couldn’t finish his phrase, he just started crying.\n\nAfter going home, Jeff kept getting reassured by his parents and Liu, telling him it would be alright.\n\n“I mean, it’s actually alright.” Said Liu. \n\nJeff looked at him and hugged him.\n\n“I’m just glad you’re back.”\n\n\n\n“Goodnight honey. Come tomorrow, we’re gonna move back to the old house.”\n\n“Thanks mom.” Said Jeff.\n\n“You know what, I think before we move, I have a score to settle.”\n\n\n\nRandy was in his room, sleeping. It was around 11PM, so everyone in the house was asleep. The wind was blowing from the one window in his room, whistling through his curtains. Randy jumped out of his bed, because he had a nightmare. He heard a metal clang, but it was just his arrest monitor. After the fight, the police decided to put him on house arrest. Still dazed by his nightmare, he looked around his room. The half hung Metallica poster was gliding in the little bit of wind coming from the window. As Randy went to close the window, a chill ran down his spine. He looked behind him, and saw him. It was Jeff, standing on his bed. Holding the same switchblade he had used him to stab him in the shoulder.\n\nAnd he started vibrating, with some kind of hum resonating from him. It was laughter. Small at first, then slowly getting louder, louder, and more insane. He jumped on Randy, smiling at him, his warm breath in symphony with the wind. \n\n“Jeff, what are you doing?”\n\n“I…” started Jeff, “don’t want to set the world on fire.”\n\nAnd he started singing a song, preparing to stab him.\n\n“Jeff, please I’m sorry. Don’t. Don’t. DON’T.”\n\nAnd Jeff stabbed him in the eye. Randy was screaming, unable to move, feeling the pain run through his body, blood gushing out of his empty eye socket.\n\n“In my heart, I have but one desire. And that one is you.”\n\nAnd stab after stab after stab, Jeff attacked his head, holes forming all over his face, body parts flying all over the room.\n\n“I just want to start a great big flame down in your heart.”\n\nJeff then gave one final skewer through his heart. Randy stopped moving, a puddle of his red body fluids staining the carpet of his room.\n\nJeff started laughing again, mixed with sorrows.\n\n“I, don’t want to set the world on fire…” He looked at the knife.\n\n“I love you too much.” He plunged the knife into his cheek, cutting a crescent shape into the sides of his mouth, still laughing, blood drops from his cut falling into the lifeless eyes of Randy.\n\nA tall man arrived in the room.\n\n“Randy? RANDY!” Jeff looked the man in the eye and ran out of the room from the window.\n\nAs the police arrived at Randy's house, they received another call. A certain Margaret Woods called to report that her son went missing.\n\n"},"443":{"title":"WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhihpx\/what_is_the_difference\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Hadil_the_potterhead","selftext":"so what's the difference between \"creepypasta site\"\n\n\nThe one we already know, and the creepy pasta app? ..\n\nI am sure the one i have it's not an app but i got it through a link that automatically can appear on my home screen like an app \n\n\n\nI really wanna show the pic but I can not put any here...

His stuff was left for me, so I decided to play his one favorite game. I pulled out his ps5 and dusted it off by blowing on it into a big dust cloud, and turned it on, but something was wrong. All of his games were labeled \"CONCORD.EXE\", I thought \"hmm strange, maybe it is simply old console errors, showing the file type?\", so I clicked on the first one. But something was very off, the character on the main menu had red and black, bloody, hyper-realistic eyes and blood on her costume, I assumed it had been years since the game was last updated, so it could be graphical glitch. I selected the PLAY button as to PLAY the game, there was only one server online ARM AND LEG PULLER.  \nSince it the only one I click PLAY as to PLAY, and the game started. There was only one other player in the game, their username was the same as mine but backwards, spooky but I thought big world, could have same name, how quaint! But in the character selection screen all of the characters were the same as the main menu, bloody and red eyed. But I selected my character nonetheless, but when I did his hand came through the tv and grabbed me with a big meaty grip and pulled me in!!! I was strapped into a machine, and he said \"This is m'favorite machine, the arm and leg puller!!!!\" and I screamed \"HELP ME HELP ME I AM TRAPPED IN THE VIDEO GAME!!!\", but he pulled the big red lever and the arm and leg puller machine turned on and pulled off my arms and legs and I DIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sometime in  20[__], I was having my 16th birthday, as I had gotten my driver's license a few weeks earlier, my mother gave me a car, my father lived in Connecticut and I lived in New York with my mom and my little brother, Billy, and I decided to go see my dad with my brother and my new car, as I was driving down the highway, I realized, I forgot to put gas in the car, luckily, I saw a McDonald's near the street. highway. I stopped the car and we got out of it, however, the problem started when we entered the restaurant. Everything was covered in dust, all the glass was broken and shattered on the floor and the paint on the walls was peeling and faded, I told Billy to stay with me and he said yes, we both went to the kitchen which was filthy, it looked like a pan full of hot oil had exploded there, and the smell was terrible. When I turned around, Billy was running towards me and said that a man dressed as a clown wanted to talk to me, I followed in the direction he told me and used the flashlight on my cell phone to guide me in the dark, until I found a Empty room with a statue of Ronald McDonald on the floor, I thought it was no big deal, until the statue stood up. I was terrified and ran out to get my brother Billy and got back in my car, I put him in the passenger seat and drove as fast as I could until I found a security checkpoint a few kilometers away. When I was looking at my In the rearview mirror, I saw that figure waving at me and something written on the wall: \"SEE YOU SOON\""},"451":{"title":"Was ist das gruseligste, das euch je passiert ist ?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhdhy0\/was_ist_das_gruseligste_das_euch_je_passiert_ist\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"jozzmao","selftext":"Schreibt es rein"},"452":{"title":"[TOMT] Looking for a 2010s MLP Smiling related Creepypasta featuring SweetieBelle and a unnamed Stallion MC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fhcddm\/tomt_looking_for_a_2010s_mlp_smiling_related\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"CRAZYTAIL98","selftext":"I kinda feel a bit bad that I keep asking for help in different sub reddits but I really wanna find this video from my childhood \nI actually have a bit of a good memory of this video\n\n which was on YouTube, I’ll get started, we take the perspective of a unnamed stalion that wakes up in ponyvile, it looked dark and as the stallion sounds like he had woken up as they say [from what I remember]: “what…is…this ponyvile…?”, he seemed confused and I’m sure there was a line that was like, “what, happened?” that’s when Sweetbelle she seems really frighten as she puts her hooves on the screen to get the viewer’s attention, I don’t really remember if the stallion had say something else aside from the fact I’m sure the stallion asked what happened but the thing I remember the most in this scene is that sweetie bell said that, “he’s coming”, the next scene we see Sweetie bell running right besides the stallion as I’m pretty sure we hear laughing or giggling in the background as the moon does appear in the sky in the background but we see a pony [that I’m honestly unsure if it was bald or not] that is given a creepy smile as it doesn’t have any pupils in its eyes, the next part of the video we see that Sweetie belle took the stalion to the Carousel Boutique but the inside background is edited to look like the lights were out, the next part of the video we see that sweetie belle came further in the boutique as we currently only see the behind of her and as for the stallion, the stallion has called out to her and asked what is she doing and I’m pretty sure the stallion has asked if she was OK, the next part is where the jump scare happens, Sweetie belle some how became like that pony in the moon, no pupils but also smiling, she then walks closer to the screen as her is edited to sound echoey and she then speaks “WELCOME” and giggles as she walks closer and comes to the screen which then goes completely back, it’s the end of the video.\n\nanother thing I wanna bring up is that we don’t hear the stallion’s voice story the very end of the video.

But after months of sending out résumés and getting nowhere, you take what you can get.\n\n**\\*\\*Office Assistant Needed. Quiet Environment. Immediate Hire.\\*\\***\n\nNo salary, no details—I could feel the desperation. It screamed \"sketchy,\" but I was burnt out. My unemployment was nearing its end, and after hundreds of applications, I needed a job, any job.\n\nI hadn't told anyone—not my parents, not my friends. My landlord had been giving me extensions on rent, but I could tell his patience was wearing thin. I was ashamed and couldn't stomach the idea of moving back home.\n\nI pressed send, and within an hour, I received an email inviting me for an interview.\n\n**\\*\\*⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆\\*\\***\n\nThe funeral home stood alone, its weathered brick façade blending into the overgrown cemetery beside it. Crooked headstones poked out from the tall grass, leaning awkwardly—slowly sinking into the earth. It was clear no one had visited in decades—no flowers, no offerings, and no one to check on the graves. But that was life—people moved, died, and forgot. Time is the only constant in life; ultimately, it erases everything.\n\nThe scent hit me as soon as I stepped through the door—thick, overwhelming. \\*I hate lilies\\*, I thought. \\*They smell like the dead.\\* But of course, they did—it was a funeral home. If I got the job, I’d better get used to it.\n\nThe chipped stone walls of the funeral home felt oppressive from the outside, but once inside, the atmosphere shifted. Despite the peeling wallpaper, faded rugs, and dust in every corner, there was something oddly comforting about the place. The dim, flickering lights barely illuminated the space, but the warm glow of mismatched lamps created a sense of familiarity. It felt lived in, like a well-worn sweater, frayed at the edges but still warm. With a little attention and care, it could easily regain some of its former charm.\n\nThe viewing room was just as comforting. Its pews were dusty but neatly arranged, and the soft glow from small lamps on either side of the room cast a muted warmth. A closed coffin sat at the front, surrounded by lilies, their thick, sickly-sweet scent filling the air and making my eyes water. The coffin unsettled me, but like the lilies, I knew I'd have to adjust quickly.\n\nJared Halloway, the funeral director, greeted me at the front desk. He looked around forty, his appearance just as worn as the building itself—shirt half-tucked, tie hanging loosely around his neck. Despite his disheveled look, there was a warmth to him, a quiet familiarity that mirrored the comforting, lived-in feel of the funeral home. His eyes flicked to the coffin I'd been staring at before settling back on me.\n\nHe smiled, trying to put me at ease.\n\n\"Don't worry. We don't bite. Well, at least I don't. The ones in the coffins, though… they've been known to get restless.\" He waggled his eyebrows up and down.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh—it was such a dad joke.\n\nJared grinned again. \"Sorry, I have a five- and three-year-old,\" he said, and you could hear the love for his kids in his voice, softening the darkness of his humor just a little.\n\n\"And well, you have to have some twisted humor surrounded by this,\" he gestured towards the viewing room. His eyes grew dark, and he looked even more tired.\n\nHe shook his head as though banishing whatever thoughts he had.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he apologized, \"I'm exhausted. Along with my two monkeys, my wife is pregnant again, and since our old assistant quit, well…\" He trailed off. \"Well, come on back to the office, Nina, and we can chat.\"\n\nI followed him to his office, which looked like a paper bomb had gone off. Mounds of documents and files spilled across the desk, some teetering on the edge, ready to fall. Papers covered the floor in haphazard piles, creeping up the walls and cluttering the windowsill, half-blocking the light. Yet, amidst the chaos, the framed photos of Jared's family stood out, carefully placed and dust-free. They were the only objects untouched by the disarray, neatly arranged on his desk and walls, each photo lovingly framed and straightened, showing smiles and happy moments. It was evident his family was always a priority, despite the neglect of the funeral home.\n\nThere was a photo of a young boy grinning, his front two teeth missing, and a little girl with blonde pigtails laughing beside him.\n\nJared was smiling broadly, one arm around his children and a hand resting lovingly on his wife's round belly. She was beautiful, laughing with her eyes closed.\n\n\"That's Ethan, and that's Iris,\" he said, pointing to the picture he was beaming.\n\n\"And that beautiful woman is my wife, Elise.\"\n\nHe noticed me looking at the rest of the pictures.\n\n\"That's my mom, she's a beauty, right?\" he said, pointing to the picture of the woman with the kind eyes. \"I get it from her, obviously.\" He chuckled, but his laugh trailed off as his gaze shifted to the picture of him and his father. The change in his mood was instant, a shadow falling over his face.\n\n\"Yeah, that's Dad—Silas,\" Jared said, his voice dropping. His eyes flicked toward the hallway, then back to me. \"You'll meet him, eventually. He… keeps to himself. Spends most of his time in the prep room. He was supposed to interview you as well, but…\" Jared's voice took on a sharper edge, his smile tightening. He glanced down the hallway again, then back at me, shaking his head slightly. \"Guess he had other things to do.\"\n\nA faint thud echoed down the hallway as he spoke, followed by a distant bang. My head jerked towards the sound, but Jared didn't seem to react. Like a saw starting up, a faint buzzing hummed through the silence.\n\n\"He prefers the dead?\" I offered, trying to lighten the mood.\n\nJared laughed. \"Right, yeah. I think you'll be a good fit here, Nina.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I thought silently, trying and failing not to show how excited I was.\n\nThe interview went as expected. Jared asked the usual boring interview questions, such as:\n\n\"Have you worked in an office before?\" and \"How comfortable are you with answering phones?\" but some questions were… more unique:\n\n\"How do you feel about being around the deceased?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air, and I swallowed, trying not to think too hard about it. \"I think I'll manage,\" I said, my voice steadier than I felt.\n\n\"Can you handle being alone here after hours?\"\n\nAlone? Here? My skin prickled, but I nodded. \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"What would you do if something in the funeral home made you uncomfortable?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Depends on what it is, I said, managing a weak smile.\n\n\"Are you squeamish at the sight of a body?\"\n\n\"No,\" I lied, though the thought of an open casket still made my stomach twist.\n\n\"How would you react to people in extreme distress from grief?\"\n\nThis one gave me pause. \"I'd try to stay calm and help them through it,\" I said, though I could already imagine the weight of other people's grief pressing down on me.\n\nThe overall functions of the job were simple enough—answering phones, handling scheduling, and filing paperwork. My mouth dropped open when he told me about the pay rate. It was much more than I had made at my previous job, and hope fluttered in my stomach.\n\n\"Does that work for you?\" Jared asked, looking down as he adjusted some paperwork. \"I know it's not a lot, but you get yearly raises.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\" I blurted, unable to stop myself. \"That's twice as much as I made at my old job!\"\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, my cheeks flushing with embarrassment at my outburst, but Jared chuckled.\n\n\"Okay, well, you're hired,\" Jared said, grinning. \"You'll fit in just fine, Nina. And well, we are in a bit of a bind right now with Luella just up and quitting. So, let's go. Let me give you a tour of the place.\"\n\nMy stomach flipped. I had done it! I had the job. Relief. Excitement. But something wasn't right. Everything was moving too fast, too easily. A flicker of doubt crept in, making my skin prickle. I forced a smile, telling myself to shake it off. Don't think about it. Just follow him.\n\nJared led me back to the front and gestured to the reception area. Paperwork and old files cluttered the large mahogany desk, stacked precariously on every surface. \"This is where you'll be working most of the time,\" he said, gesturing toward a small desk by the window. \"You'll greet people, handle phone calls, schedule, paperwork—basic boring admin stuff. Nothing too crazy.\"\n\nI nodded, my eyes scanning the room. It looked as if the woman who worked here had left in a rush. An open tube of lipstick lay abandoned on the desk, a half-empty coffee cup sat forgotten, and a jacket was slung over the back of a chair as though someone had just stepped out but planned to return any minute.\n\nEverything felt… unfinished, like whoever had been there had left in a hurry.\n\n\"This way,\" Jared said, guiding me toward another room. As soon as we entered, the heavy scent of lilies hit me again, and I realized this must be the viewing room. The soft glow from the lamps created a muted warmth, and the room, though simple, had an almost comforting feel.\n\n\"This is the heart of the place,\" Jared explained. \"You'll sometimes help out here—arranging flowers, ensuring the tissues are stocked, keeping things neat.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"You don't have to worry about the bodies, though. Leave that to us, the professionals.\"\n\nI laughed nervously. The closed coffin at the front of the room caught my eye, sending a small shiver through me. I quickly looked away, not wanting to let my unease show.\n\nAs we left the viewing room, the floorboards groaned underfoot, and a sudden draft chilled the back of my neck as if something had brushed past me. Startled, I turned to look but saw nothing, only the soft glow of the lamps and the lingering scent of lilies. My stomach clenched as I tried to shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nJared continued the tour, walking down a narrow hallway with dimly lit portraits of solemn faces. \"This is the arrangement room,\" he said, opening another door. Inside, an old wooden table sat in the middle, surrounded by chairs. Brochures for caskets and urns were fanned out across the surface.\n\n\"You probably won't spend too much time here unless I need help organizing stuff or setting things up for families,\" he said, his tone light but distracted, as if his mind was elsewhere. I noticed his eyes flicker toward the room's corners, almost as if expecting to see someone.\n\n\"Okay,\" I muttered, feeling the heavy air pressing around me. I glanced over my shoulder again, the shadows in the hallway seeming to shift for a moment. Something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it.\n\nWe moved on to the storage room, cluttered with supplies—more files, cleaning materials, and stacks of unopened boxes. Jared gestured absently. \"This is where we keep any extra supplies. If you ever need anything, it'll be here.\"\n\nI barely listened. The hairs on the back of my neck were still standing on end. I was sure someone had been watching us.\n\nJared's voice broke the eerie silence. \"This way,\" he said, his voice dropping slightly lower, guiding me toward another door. \"The garage is through here. It's where we keep the hearse. Yeehaw!\" He chuckled. \"Sorry, my kids call the hearse a horse. Another dad joke—better get used to them.\"\n\nI found myself smiling. He clearly adored his kids. He was a good father.\n\nI told him so, and he laughed again, slightly embarrassed. \"Yeah, they're my world. I'd do anything for them.\"\n\nWe reached another larger and dimly lit room with cold steel tables and cabinets along the walls. Jared's voice grew quieter, more serious. \"This is the prep room. The embalming and everything happens here. You'll never have to come in unless… well, you'll probably never have to come in.\"\n\nHe hesitated momentarily, glancing at me before adding, \"And that back there is the cremation room.\" He pointed toward a large, scratched door at the end of the hall, its edges darkened from years of wear.\n\n\"You won't be going in there either,\" he said, his voice soft, almost reluctant. \"But I just want you to know the full layout of the place.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, my eyes darting around the sterile space. A shadow flickered at the edge of my vision, but it was gone when I turned my head. My chest tightened, and a shiver ran down my spine.\n\nJared stared at the door so long that it made me uncomfortable. The seconds dragged on, the silence pressing in like a weight. I shifted on my feet, waiting for him to say something. Just as I opened my mouth, Jared blinked, snapping out of whatever trance had taken hold.\n\nHe cleared his throat awkwardly. \"Okay, that's the end of the tour. Now, I can officially welcome you to Halloway Funeral. Congratulations,\" he said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.\n\n\"So, when can you start?\"\n\n\"Is tomorrow okay?\" I asked, trying to control my excitement.\n\n\"Perfect,\" Jared said with a grin. \"Let's get the paperwork sorted, and I'll train you first thing in the morning. Let's say 7? Before it gets rowdy in here.\" He chuckled at his joke.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. \"Yeah! Sure, thank you so much,\" I said, my voice bright with excitement. This was exactly what I needed—a fresh start. But as Jared turned and started walking down the hallway, whistling a low, casual tune, that excitement began to dim like a candle flickering in the wind. The uneasy feeling from earlier crept back in, heavier this time.\n\nI followed him, but the sensation of being watched clung to me. The shadows along the hallway felt darker, more alive. Instinctively, I glanced over my shoulder—and froze.\n\nThe door to the embalming room creaked open slowly. Through the narrow gap, a man stared at me. His wild, untamed white hair fell to his shoulders, and his face was emotionless. His unblinking eyes locked onto mine, and a chill crept down my spine.\n\nWait... I knew that face. My mind flashed back to Jared's office, to the framed photo on his desk—the one of him standing in front of the funeral home, looking solemn beside a man with unruly hair. It was Silas- Silas Halloway, owner of the funeral home and Jared's father. \n\nI blinked, my heart hammering in my chest. When I opened my eyes, the door was shut, as if nothing had happened. Then, the low buzz of the saw filled the air again.\n\n**\\*\\*⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆\\*\\***\n\nThe first few days at the funeral home were much quieter and slower than any other job I’d had before.\n\n\"That’s because most of our clients don’t talk back,\" Jared quipped with a grin as we broke for lunch on the third day of training.\n\nI rolled my eyes and smiled, surprised to find myself hungry even though I knew that just a few doors down, there were dead bodies. \\*Is it even sanitary to eat here?\\* I thought, spearing a piece of lettuce with my fork and staring at it. \\*I mean, body fluids are airborne, right?\\*\n\nJared saw the look on my face and chuckled. \"I know what you’re thinking, Nina,\" he said, leaning back in his chair. \"But don’t worry, the break room’s a safe zone. Completely separate from the prep area.\"\n\nHe grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. \"Hell, you could even eat at the embalming table if you wanted! That’s how strong our disinfectants are. Dad—Silas—has been known to do that.\"\n\nI dropped my fork into my salad. \"Seriously?\" I squeaked, my stomach churning. \"That’s disgusting!\" I said, feeling queasy. I didn’t think I’d be finishing my lunch today.\n\nJared laughed again, holding up his hands in mock surrender. \"Of course not, sorry! Please keep eating. I really need to learn when to shut up.\"\n\nHe rubbed the back of his neck with a sheepish grin. \"Elise is always kicking me under the table when dinner guests are over. My shin should be broken by now. I can’t help it.\" He shrugged. \"It comes with the environment, I guess. When you’ve grown up surrounded by the dead, you forget what’s normal for other people.\"\n\nI forced a faint smile and pushed away my lunch. My appetite had vanished completely.\n\nJared noticed, his face falling. \"Oh, no! I’m so sorry; it was just a joke. Even Silas isn’t that bad.\"\n\nBut his eyes betrayed him, hinting that Silas was exactly that bad. I wondered, not for the first time, how odd and strained their relationship seemed. Whenever Jared mentioned his dad, a storm cloud overtook the room, thickening the air with an unsettling heaviness.\n\n\"It’s okay! Seriously!\" I said hurriedly. \"I’m full,\" I lied, \"and it’s not very good.\"\n\nOf course, my stomach betrayed me with a loud grumble at that very moment. Awkward.\n\nMercifully, Jared pretended not to notice and instead changed the topic, telling me more about his kids. I found myself relaxing as he spoke. He was easy to talk to.\n\n\"Ethan’s five and full of energy,\" Jared said. \"Always running around, always curious, always doing what he shouldn’t be doing. And Iris, she’s three. She’s at that age where she’s trying to do everything Ethan does. It’s… exhausting but fun. She’s a little weirdo like me—she loves bugs. Any bug. Her brother despises them, so we have to stop her from shoving them in his face. She’ll yell, 'Bug!' and Ethan will run away screaming. And then I get in trouble with Elise for laughing, but I can’t help it! It’s so funny and cute.\"\n\nI laughed, picturing the chaos. \"They sound sweet.\" Then I smiled bitterly, my fingers tightening slightly around the table’s edge as I thought of my brother and how we used to terrorize one another.\n\n\"They are. And loud,\" Jared laughed, running a hand through his hair. \"But I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Elise is a saint for keeping up with them.\" He paused. \"And me.\"\n\nI leaned forward, pushing the memories away. \"How do you do it all?\" I asked. \"This job, your family… The transition from—\" I gestured around — \"this, to the liveliness at home. It must be difficult.\"\n\nJared’s smile faltered slightly, and I saw the weight of responsibility in his eyes for a moment. \"It’s difficult,\" he admitted. \"But we make it work. Family comes first, though. Always.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding the sentiment. \"I can tell you love them a lot.\"\n\n\"I do,\" he said, brightening. \"They drive me insane, but I do.\" He gave me a warm smile. \"What about you? What about your family? Any weirdos?\" His eyes narrowed conspiratorially. \"Are you the weirdo?\"\n\nThat made me laugh. \"I mean, maybe. I collect buttons. You know, as a hobby.\"\n\nJared smiled and shook his head. \"That’s not weird! It’s a unique hobby. How many do you have?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"A few thousand, maybe.\"\n\n\"Wow! That’s quite the collection! And your family?\"\n\n\"Well, I have my mom and dad, but they live at least two hours away. I try to visit as often as possible, but you know… life,\" I said quietly. \"But it’s just the two of them now. I-I had a brother, but he died a few years ago. Overdose.\" I spat the word out; it tasted like a bitter pill on my tongue.\n\n\"Gideon, right?\" Jared said, his tone sympathetic.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I’m so sorry, Nina. That must’ve been incredibly hard.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, unable to stop the tears that came whenever I talked about Gideon.\n\nWithout a word, Jared reached into his pocket and handed me a small pack of tissues.\n\n\"Always gotta have some of these on hand,\" he said with a faint, comforting smile.\n\nI took the tissues, blinking quickly as I tried to steady myself, my throat tightening.\n\nJared leaned back in his chair, staring at the table. \"When I was a kid… my mom died. Vivian. Her name was Vivian. Beautiful, right? She was beautiful.\" His voice was quieter now. \"Silas—Dad—handled everything himself. The prep, the funeral… all of it.\" Jared’s eyes flickered with something I couldn’t quite place—anger, sadness—a mixture of both?\n\nI didn’t know what to say to that. It all began making sense—no wonder Jared’s relationship with his dad was tense. The thought of Silas handling his own wife’s funeral—like just another task on a to-do list—was… wrong. It felt cold and mechanical. A small part of me wondered if that’s what this job did to people if it hollowed them out over time until death became just another part of the routine. And how poor Jared must have felt. How could he stand working here still? If something like that happened to me, I would do anything but work around the dead.\n\n\"I’m so sorry,\" I whispered, not knowing what else to say.\n\nJared nodded briskly, now staring into the distance, lost in memory.\n\n\"So, what’s the weirdest thing that’s happened to you here?\" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation somewhere lighter.\n\nJared’s face immediately brightened as he thought for a moment. \"Hmmm. The weirdest thing? Hmm, it’s hard to say. But there was that one time we found a stray cat hiding in one of the caskets.\"\n\nI blinked, laughing in disbelief. \"A cat?\"\n\n\"Yup, scared the hell out of me,\" Jared grinned, shaking his head. \"I popped open the casket to do a final check, and there it was, just lounging around like it had booked the place for the night. I mean, paws crossed, total attitude.\"\n\nI continued to laugh. \"So, what happened?\"\n\n\"I brought him home after I took him to the vet, of course. My kids had been asking for a pet—but Elise? Boy, I didn’t hear the end of it when I got home.\"\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you? Why didn’t you tell me? Where did it even come from?\" He shook his head, grinning. \"Of course, I didn’t tell her where I found him. Elise is very superstitious. But the kids were ecstatic, and now Elise loves him! She treats him like one of the kids. Cats! There’s something about them. His name is Morty. Morty the Fat Cat!\" Jared laughed. \"Elise always tells me to stop fat-shaming him, but… well, he \\*is\\* fat.\"\n\nI shook my head, still giggling. Jared was something else—I’d never had a boss like him. For the first time since starting the job, I felt at ease.\n\nMaybe this will work out, and it could help me cope with Giddy’s death.\n\nAlso, the pay was too good to pass up.\n\n\\*\\*⋆˖⁺‧₊☽◯☾₊‧⁺˖⋆\\*\\*\n\nAfter lunch, we went to the supply closet to unpack and organize a huge delivery. And since it was so slow today, Jared thought it’d be best to restock and break down the boxes. Jared handed me a box cutter, and we worked in comfortable silence for a while.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, breaking the silence, \"I love animals, especially strays—cats, dogs… anything that needed a home. Even as a kid, I’d sneak food out for them whenever I could. My mom used to say I’d bring home anything with fur if I had the chance.\" He chuckled. \"Guess that’s still true today.\"\n\nHe paused momentarily, then added, \"When you grow up around death, sometimes it feels good to take care of something still living.\"\n\nAs he talked about taking care of stray animals, I couldn’t help but wonder—did he think of me like that? Just another stray he’d taken in, trying to make sense of things and survive?\n\nSomething had been bothering me for a while, but I couldn’t quite put my thumb on it. It was the conversation during lunch when he had asked about my family and—\n\n\"How did you know?\" I asked, my mouth dry. \"How did you know my brother’s name?\"\n\nJared paused, glancing up from the box he was opening. \"Huh?\" he said, his mouth hanging open.\n\n\"My brother. Gideon.\" My heart was pounding. \"I never told you his name.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" I asked, my throat tightening. \"How did you know my brother’s name?\"\n\nJared’s face darkened for a second before he forced a smile. \"Oh… must’ve come up in the background check,\" he said, his tone a little too casual and quick. \"I didn’t mean to upset you. I shouldn’t have brought it up.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, not sure what to believe. On one hand, it made sense, but I felt uneasy and strangely violated. \\*He’s your boss\\*, I thought, \\*at your place of employment. Of course, he did a background check; it’s what jobs do. It makes sense. Chill out!\\*\n\nBut I couldn’t shake the unease that overtook me. \\*Just keep working,\\* I thought; the day was nearly over. I grabbed another box, readied the box cutter, and began slicing it open when a sudden chill gripped me.\n\n\"Run,\" a soft, urgent voice whispered into my ear. \"Run, Nina! Go!\"\n\nStartled, I jumped and looked around. My hand slipped as I gripped the box cutter.\n\n\"Ow!\" I hissed, feeling a sharp, sudden pain in my hand. I looked down and saw blood pouring from my thumb, seeping into the partially cut box.\n\nJared glanced up, startled, his eyes widening at the sight of the blood. He drew back for a moment; then concern settled over his face. Quickly, he ripped open a box of tissues and rushed to my side, firmly wrapping them around my bloody thumb.\n\n\"Hold it tight,\" he said. \"I’ll get the Band-Aids and antiseptic.\"\n\nBefore leaving, he joked, \"Be careful not to let it drop on the floor. Otherwise, this place will never let you go.\" His chuckle was hollow as he closed the door, leaving me staring after him, bewildered.\n\nI pressed the tissues against my thumb. The tissue had already soaked through. I grabbed some more, carefully unwrapping the first one. But as I peeled it away, the wound pulsed, and blood dripped onto the carpet.\n\n\"Shit,\" I hissed, quickly re-wrapping my thumb and blotted at the stain.\n\nThe light overhead flickered, and then, with a faint pop, it went out, plunging me into darkness.\n\nA creak came behind me; I froze and slowly turned towards the door. I watched as it slowly opened, my blood turning ice cold.\n\nA sharp gust of cold air swept into the room, carrying a faint, musty odor—like something long forgotten.\n\nA figure stood in the doorway facing me, and the hair on my neck rose, and my skin broke out in goosebumps.\n\nThere was something not right about it. It looked wrong. It leaned at a sharp angle with crooked, bent limbs, and its head lolled on its neck as though unable to support itself.\n\nThe air thickened around her, charged with something dark and wrong as though the room was warning me. A strong antiseptic smell mixed with rot filled the room, making my eyes water and my nostrils burn.\n\nThe figure stepped forward, and my hands scrabbled at the ground, desperate to find the box cutter. I had a feeling it wouldn’t help, but what else did I have?\n\nI scooted back on my butt as far as I could until my back pressed against the wall.\n\nIt stumbled as it walked, limbs buckling with every step. \\*They’re broken\\*, I realized. \\*Its legs are broken.\\* The sound of bone grinding against bone echoed in the silence. This was all so unbelievable that I had to laugh.\n\n\\*Buzzzz\\*\n\nThe light overhead flickered back on with a low hum—harsh and glaring, illuminating the room in all its horrific detail.\n\nIt was a woman. Her face was blurry as if a paintbrush had swiped over her features, erasing and distorting them. The paint dripped off her skull like melting wax, exposing pulsating tendons and gray bone.\n\nHer fingers stretched toward me, twitching and spasming.\n\nI was trapped; there was nowhere to go. The stench of her was nauseating. I gagged, then vomited down the front of my shirt.\n\nHer hand shot forward and closed around my throat. Her black fingernails dug into the soft flesh like a clamp. My body thrashed in desperate panic, but her grip was strong and slowly tightened, unrelenting.\n\nBlack spots swam in my vision, and my lungs burned—I couldn’t breathe. I was going to die. I clawed at her hand, my nails digging and sinking into her decaying flesh.\n\nShe gently stroked the underside of my chin with her free hand.\n\n\"Jared,\" she whispered. \"Jared, I missed you so much.\"\n\nIf I could gasp, I would have, but I could only stare at her. I knew who this was now—this thing that was killing me as her face melted off in rivulets.\n\nMy strength was fading, the world was spinning, and the edges of my vision blurred. Darkness was overtaking me. I stopped trying to fight it. My arms went limp at my sides. It was over. I was dead.\n\n\"Jared, my baby,\" Vivian Holloway—Silas’s wife and Jared’s mom—whispered, her voice full of love. \"I love you so much, but sometimes,\" her grip tightened around my throat, \"I just want to crush you into dust.\""},"454":{"title":"ARM AND LEG PULLER MACHINE - A CONCORD CREEPYPASTA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fh7mu8\/arm_and_leg_puller_machine_a_concord_creepypasta\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Pump_Up_the_Dave","selftext":"Everyday I came home to ply my favorite game concord for the ps5, I know it didn’t get the best reception, but I just found the characters so charming, and the gameplay so fun!

In brackets it told me that the message was going to turn into a butterfly after 10 minutes. So I read the message and I memorised it and then after 10 minutes the message turned into a butterfly. It was unusual to see a message turn into a butterfly. Then when the wattsapp message was no longer a message but a butterfly, then more information in brackets appeared on the screen. It advised me that if I wanted to have the secret message ingrained into my mind, then I would have to eat the butterfly. \n\nSo I ate the butterfly and the secret message was now ingrained into my mind. Then I received another secret message, and in brackets it said that the message would disappear and turn into a spider in 10 minutes. It also told me that if I wanted to have the secret message ingrained into my mind, then I would have to eat the spider. So I ate the spider and now that secret message is ingrained in my mind. It's good to have important messages ingrained into my mind. I work in the secret services and so I should have these things ingrained in my mind. \n\nThen I received more secret messages through wattsapp. The secrecy was more now and it was such a deep secret, I only had 5 minutes this time to remember it. After 5 minutes this message was going to turn into a chicken. The chicken was a crazy one and I knew that if I wanted to have this secret message ingrained into my mind, then I will need to eat the chicken. So I ate the chicken and the secret was ingrained into my mind. This secret was so deep into secrecy, that it could cause the end of the world if it went out. \n\nAlso it feels good to hold secrets of this heavy nature and it makes me feel important. I love feeling important and knowing things that most people don't know. Then I received the most secretive secret I have ever come across in a wattsapp message. This time there was 3 minutes to remember the secretive message, and after 3 minutes the message will turn into a fully grown male. As it turned into a fully grown male, it was cowering because it knew that I would have to eat him, if I wanted the secretive message ingrained into my mind. \n\nSo I ate him.

I did not write down the date ok?! :D  \nI thought people here would appreciate. Here goes.\n\n  \nNormal day,.. no stress. Went to sleep,... had some completely ordinary dream. I don't even know what it was, I just know it was so \"white bread\" I don't even know the plot.\n\nThe only reason I know I had it at all, was that at the end... right before waking up, out of nowhere, something started to aggressively whisper in my ear. Disturbingly close. And I mean, out of nowhere. It was not connected to the boring dream plot, it just appeared right before I woke up.  \nIt was speaking alien like, utter gibberish, not a real language I think. I remembered it 100%... no haze, just plain did not sound like anything structured.\n\nAnyway... I wake up, shake it off, and go about my day. I have my fair share of nightmares, and this was... slightly disturbing, but not out of the ordinary range. I did not even think about it.\n\nNext day... again. Some innocent dream I don't have a recollection off is ending... and the same thing starts whispering in my ear. Again, out of effin nowhere, right at the end!  \nI freak out a bit, and jerk myself awake. I moved my body, opened my eyes... look at my room, all good.  \nClose them again.\n\n... IT CAME BACK!! I STILL HEAR THE WHISPER!!  \nI almost soiled myself... I jerk myself awake even more. It goes away.  \nA LOT harder to dismiss it this time. But in the end I do.. I think ... \"well, I woke myself only partially, and I was still in a dream like state, so it came back... or lets say... persisted\". It happens sometimes... very rare though, I have to be quite unlucky for this to transpire.\n\nThird day.  \nAnother completely normal dream I don't remember, right before I wake up.  \nA WOMAN, starts speaking to me in ENGLISH. (note: English is my 2nd language,... I do not dream in it)  \nI don't remember it word for word, but the short exchange went like this.\n\nHer: You have to be careful, that whispering thing came after me too. (talking calm)  \nMe: What? Who are you, are you my guardian angel?  \nHer: No.\n\nI wake up.\n\nNever heard the whispering again (thank god!). I was tense going to sleep for a week :D.  \nNever heard from the woman again, but if you are out there... \"THANK YOU for the heads up! :) \"\n\nReal or all dream? I can't tell you. Probably going to be really easy for other people to dismiss.  \nWhat I can tell you is that for me, that last conversation sealed the deal... whatever it all was, it was not a dream.  \nIt overlapped my dream, or infiltrated it, or spoke to my real ear. Does not matter.  \nThis was not me."},"461":{"title":"I Spent the Night in a Haunted House and This Happened!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fgqzg7\/i_spent_the_night_in_a_haunted_house_and_this\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Sudden-Zombie9098","selftext":"[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiitV8SVVis&amp;t=1s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiitV8SVVis&amp;t=1s) It was a bitterly cold night in 2018 when I moved into an old, weathered house deep in the countryside. The kind of house where the nearest neighbor was miles away and the nights were so quiet you could hear your own heartbeat. This place had a reputation in the nearby village—people whispered that it was haunted, but I dismissed it as just another old wives’ tale meant to scare off city folk like me.\n\nThe first few nights passed uneventfully. The house was drafty, the floors creaked with every step, but nothing out of the ordinary happened. That was until the fifth night, when everything changed.\n\nI was settled in the living room, reading by the dim light of a single lamp. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows, but I paid it no mind, absorbed in my book. Suddenly, a faint scratching noise broke the silence, coming from the ceiling above me. I paused, listening intently, but the sound ceased as abruptly as it had begun. I chalked it up to a rat or some other small creature, though unease began to creep in. But then, the scratching returned, louder this time, as if nails were being dragged across wood.\n\nI stood up, my heart beginning to race. The scratching moved, traveling from the ceiling to the walls, circling the room. It was as if something was trapped behind the wallpaper, desperately trying to break free. Panic set in, but I fought to stay calm. I grabbed a broom and banged it against the wall, shouting, “Get out! Get out of here!”\n\nThe noise stopped, and the house fell into an oppressive silence. I took a deep breath, convinced it was over, but then the lights flickered, and the temperature in the room plummeted. I could see my breath in the air, forming a mist. The rancid odor that followed was unbearable—like rotting meat.\n\nThe stench was overwhelming, making me gag. I covered my nose, but the smell seemed to seep into my skin, clinging to me. I stumbled back, my eyes watering, and that’s when I saw it.\n\nIn the darkest corner of the room, something was moving. At first, it was just a shape—a dark mass growing, stretching toward me. As it came closer, I saw it was a figure—tall and twisted, with long, gnarled limbs and eyes that glowed like embers in the dark.\n\nIt moved with unnatural speed, closing the distance between us in seconds. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move as it reached out with one bony hand, its fingers ending in sharp, black claws.\n\nThe creature’s face was inches from mine now, its breath hot and putrid against my skin. It grinned, revealing rows of jagged teeth, and whispered in a voice that was both a hiss and a growl, “You shouldn’t have come here.”\n\nThe room spun, and I felt myself being pulled into the darkness, into the creature’s cold, unrelenting embrace. I fought to stay conscious, but it was like being drowned in ink—suffocating and cold. The last thing I remember before everything went black was the sound of my own heartbeat, pounding in my ears.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I was on the floor, the room filled with sunlight. The creature was gone, but the smell lingered faintly. My body ached, and when I looked in the mirror, I saw deep, red scratches down my arms and neck, as though I had been clawed by something.\n\nI couldn’t stay in that house another night. I packed my things and left, not caring where I went as long as it was far from that place. I never discovered what that creature was or why it targeted me, but I know one thing for certain—I’ll never forget those glowing eyes or the pure, unrelenting terror that accompanied them.\n\nTo this day, I still feel like something is watching me, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike again. And I’m terrified that next time, I might not be able to escape.\n\n  \nWatch the full animated story [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiitV8SVVis&amp;t=1s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiitV8SVVis&amp;t=1s) to experience every chilling detail.

We were an ordinary family, as far as anyone could tell. Yet, there was something peculiar about our family history, particularly our father’s.\n\nGrowing up, I had always been curious about his past, especially about his parents, but he never spoke a word about them. It was as if they didn’t exist. Sometimes, I would catch Dad staring off into the distance, a look of sorrow hidden deep in his eyes, but he would quickly brush it off, returning to his usual cheerful self. I always knew there was something he was keeping from us; I just never had the courage to ask.\n\nKyle and I were lounging on the couch one morning, binge-watching our favorite TV show when the doorbell rang. I hopped up and rushed to get the mail. Among the usual stack of bills and ads was a single, ominous envelope addressed to our dad. Without giving it much thought, I handed it over to him.\n\nDad tore it open, and as he read the letter, his face went pale. His usual calm demeanor vanished, replaced by a torrent of emotions that flickered across his face—confusion, sorrow, and something else I couldn't quite place. He said nothing. My mom, sensing something was wrong, leaned over and glanced at the letter in his hands. Her reaction was immediate. She gasped, covering her mouth with her hand, whispering, “Oh my God, I’m so sorry.”\n\nKyle and I exchanged worried glances, utterly confused. What could this letter possibly say? Just as I was about to ask, Dad crumpled the paper into a tight ball and tossed it into the trash can. Without a word, he stormed out of the house. Mom followed him out, leaving Kyle and me in a thick cloud of confusion and silence.\n\nWe stared at the door for a moment, unsure of what had just happened. My heart raced, and my curiosity burned even brighter. Something in that letter had shaken our parents deeply, and I had to know what it was.\n\n“Kyle, we have to see what that was,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nKyle raised an eyebrow. “You’re not seriously thinking about going through the trash, are you?”\n\n“Do you have a better idea?” I shot back, already making my way over to the crumpled letter. With trembling hands, I reached into the trash can and pulled it out, carefully smoothing the creases. Kyle joined me, his curiosity piqued.\n\nThe letter wasn’t long, but the words hit hard. It was an official document notifying Dad of an inheritance. Our grandfather—someone we hadn’t even known was still alive—had passed away. Dad had inherited his father’s home, a large estate located in some remote area of Ohio. I looked up at Kyle, wide-eyed.\n\n“Our grandfather…?” I said, stunned.\n\n“I didn’t even know he was still alive,” Kyle muttered, shaking his head. “This is huge.”\n\nIt felt surreal. We had never known our dad’s parents. He had never spoken about them, and here we were, reading about a house we had no clue existed, left behind by a man we never knew.\n\n“We have to go,” I said suddenly.\n\n“Go? To Ohio?” Kyle replied, eyes wide with disbelief. “Are you serious?”\n\n“Dead serious,” I said. “There’s something about this. We’ve spent our whole lives not knowing anything about Dad’s family. This is our chance to find out.”\n\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, Kyle nodded. “Alright, let’s do it.”\n\nThat evening, after our parents returned home—both looking eerily composed—we made up a story about going on a camping trip. Kyle and I were frequent campers, so they didn’t question it. The next morning, we booked a flight to Ohio and rented a car to find the property. It was a long drive through increasingly desolate roads, but eventually, we found it.\n\nThe house was massive, an old two-story building with a large lake glistening behind it. The place looked abandoned, the paint peeling off the walls, the windows caked with dust. There wasn’t another house in sight. It was just us and this eerie, decrepit home.\n\nWe entered the house, and the air was heavy with dust and the distinct odor of rot. The wooden floor groaned under our footsteps as we wandered through the shadowy rooms. Old furniture was strewn around, blanketed in dust and webs. The entire place seemed trapped in time, as if it had been abandoned for decades.\n\nAs we walked through the house, something caught my eye. A framed photograph, resting on a dusty shelf. I picked it up, wiping the grime away with my sleeve. It was a picture of a young couple standing with a small child. My breath caught in my throat. The child looked just like Dad when he was younger, and the woman—her face was weary, her eyes distant.\n\n“Kyle, look at this,” I whispered.\n\nKyle stepped over, peering at the photograph. “That’s Dad, isn’t it?” he asked, his voice quiet.\n\n“Yeah,” I said, nodding slowly. “And those must be his parents.”\n\nThe woman in the picture wore a gold ring that caught the light. I stared at her face, trying to piece together the fragments of my dad’s past. Why had he never told us about them?\n\nAs the evening wore on, we cleaned up a little and made a small area to sleep. We decided we would explore more in the morning. After a quick snack, we decided to call it a night. I fell asleep quickly, but a few hours later, I was jolted awake by a strange noise coming from upstairs.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just the old house settling, but the sound was persistent. A soft creaking, like footsteps. I glanced over at Kyle, still fast asleep. Not wanting to wake him, I grabbed a flashlight and decided to investigate.\n\nThe house was deathly silent as I crept up the stairs. The noise seemed to be coming from one of the rooms at the end of the hall.\n\nI reached the door and pushed it open slowly. The room was cold and smelled of something rotten, like it hadn’t been aired out in years. I swept the flashlight around the room. Nothing seemed out of place, just old furniture and dusty curtains swaying slightly in the breeze.\n\nAnd then, just as I turned to leave, I heard it again. A soft, muffled sound—like someone crying. My heart pounded in my chest as I swung the flashlight around.\n\nThat’s when I saw her.\n\nIn the far corner of the room, huddled on the floor, was a woman. Her face was hidden behind her knees, and she was wearing a long, tattered gown, yellowed with age. My heart stopped when I saw the gold ring on her finger—the same one from the photograph.\n\nI froze, unable to move or speak. The woman began to weep softly, her thin body trembling. My entire body was paralyzed with fear. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out.\n\nI felt a cold hand grabbed my shoulder, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“Are you okay?” Kyle whispered, standing beside me. He must have followed me upstairs.\n\nI pointed toward the corner where the woman had been, but when we both looked, she was gone. The room was empty. My heart was racing, and my palms was sweating.\n\n“I swear she was right there,” I said, while my voice was shaking.\n\nKyle raised an eyebrow while he looks at me. “You’re just tired. You probably imagined it. Let’s get out of here.”\n\nI didn’t argue. Maybe he was right. Maybe I had just imagined the whole thing. But deep down, I knew what I had seen.\n\nWe went back downstairs, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my mind racing. And then, just as I was starting to drift off, I heard a soft knock.\n\nAt first, I thought I had imagined it, but then it came again. A gentle tapping on the window.\n\nSo, I sat up slowly and I turned to look at the window, and there she was—the same woman. She was looking at me while her cheek was pressed against the glass. She smiled and then raised her hand, the one with the gold ring, and tapped on the glass again.\n\nI screamed in panic, loud enough to wake Kyle. So, he bolted upright, his eyes wide with fear.\n\n“What’s wrong?” he shouted.\n\nI pointed at the window, but the woman was gone again. Kyle rushed over and pulled back the curtain. There was nothing outside but the dark, still night.\n\n“I swear, Kyle, I saw her,” I said, my voice trembling. “It’s her. The woman from the photo. She’s here.”\n\nKyle was about to tell me I was imagining things again, but then we both heard it. A low, chilling laugh, echoing through the room.\n\nWithout another word, we grabbed our things and bolted out of the house. We didn’t stop until we were in the car, speeding down the empty road, away from that cursed place.\n\nThe next morning, we called our parents. Dad was furious when he found out where we had been, but he told us to stay put. They were coming to get us. When they arrived, Dad’s face was pale, his eyes filled with a sorrow I had never seen before.\n\nOn the drive back, Dad finally opened up about the truth he had kept buried for so long, his voice low and heavy. Mom was sitting in the front passenger seat, her hand resting gently on his shoulder as he spoke. The words came out slowly, as if they weighed on him with every breath.\n\nOur grandfather had killed our grandmother—brutally. He chopped her into pieces and hid her remains in the house, in the bedroom upstairs where Kyle and I had slept just the night before.\n\nI felt my heart clench, I could hardly believe what I was hearing. My Dad had witnessed the entire murder as a child. Our grandfather was arrested and spent the rest of his days in prison, while Dad was placed and grew up in foster care.\n\nI sat stunned in silence, trying to make sense of it all. My mind raced with so many questions.\n\nWhat did my grandma do to deserve such brutality? Was her body ever found?\n\nThe woman Kyle and I had seen in the house—she was our grandmother. But why? What does she want?\n\nAs Dad continued talking, I could tell this was tearing him apart to relive.\n\n“There’s a family photo in the house,” I said quietly, breaking the silence. “Is that…them?”\n\nDad nodded slowly, “yes, son. That’s them.”\n\nI hesitated; I was unsure if I should push further, but the question escaped me before I could stop it. “How come…”\n\nDad cut me off before I could finish. “They weren’t good people, son.”\n\nI sat down quietly for a second. “But what about Grandma?” I asked softly, hoping there was something good to cling to. While I sat in the backseat, I could see half his face from the rearview mirror. Tears welled up in his eyes, and for the first time, I saw him truly vulnerable. His voice cracked as he spoke again.\n\n“She...she wasn’t always like that,” he choked out, tears on his cheeks. “But there are things about her—things I don’t wish to remember.”\n\n“In fact, I’d prefer if we just forgot about her,” he added, while wiping his tears with his sleeve.\n\nThe weight of his words hung heavy in the air, and I realized just how much pain he had carried all these years. But what could she have done to my dad, for him to not want to remember her anymore?\n\nMore questions.\n\nBut this time, I held my tongue. I couldn’t bear to see him like this. I said gently. “It’s okay, Dad. You don’t have to.”\n\nI rolled down the window, letting the wind rush against my face. I thought about everything Dad had been through, about why he had always been so guarded when it came to his family. Now, it all made sense.\n\nAs we drove away from Ohio, the atmosphere in the car was heavy. No one spoke for a long time. Dad's confession had left Kyle and me reeling, our minds struggling to process the reality of what we had witnessed and what we had just learned. The image of the ghostly woman still haunted me, her eyes and unsettling smile burned into my memory. I kept glancing out of the window, half-expecting to see her figure trailing behind us, but all I saw were the endless stretches of road.\n\nMom tried to break the tension. “We’ll be home soon,” she said softly, though her voice sounded as strained as the rest of us felt.\n\nKyle was unusually quiet, staring straight ahead. He hadn’t said much since we left the house. I could tell he was trying to make sense of everything just like I was. But there was something off about him—his silence felt different, heavier, as if something more was bothering him.\n\nWhen we finally pulled up to our house in Chicago, I felt a strange sense of relief. Being back in familiar surroundings somehow made the nightmare we’d experienced in Ohio feel distant. But even as I stepped inside our home, I couldn’t shake the lingering feeling that something wasn’t right.\n\nThat night, after unpacking, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to let sleep take me. My thoughts kept circling back to Ohio, to that house, and to our grandmother. What if she was still there? What if she had followed us?\n\nSuddenly, I heard a soft knock on my bedroom door. I was startled, I got up from lying on the bed. “Come in,” I called out, assuming it was Kyle or Mom. The door creaked open, and Kyle stepped inside. He looked pale, his face drawn and expressionless.\n\n“Kyle, you okay?” I asked, my voice a whisper in the dark.\n\nHe didn’t answer right away. Instead, he stood there, staring at me, his eyes wide and empty. Something was wrong. My stomach knotted with unease.\n\n“What’s going on?” I asked again, more urgently this time.\n\nThen, finally, Kyle spoke, but his voice didn’t sound like his own—it was cold, distant, almost hollow. “She’s not gone,” he whispered. “She’s still with us.”\n\nThe hair on the back of my neck stood up. “What are you on about?” I asked quietly, my voice trembling.\n\nKyle stepped closer, and I noticed something glinting in the dim light. My heart skipped a beat when I saw it—a gold ring, the same gold ring we had seen in the photograph, the same one the ghostly woman had worn.\n\nA wave of dread hit me. “Kyle…where did you get that?”\n\nHe raised his hand, staring at the ring as if seeing it for the first time. His eyes widened, and for a brief moment, I saw fear flicker across his face. “I…I don’t know,” he stammered. “I woke up, and it was just…there.”\n\nI jumped out of bed, my heart racing. “Take it off, Kyle! Take it off now!”\n\nKyle grabbed at the ring, pulling at it desperately, but it wouldn’t budge. His face twisted in panic as he yanked harder, but the ring seemed to tighten around his finger, almost like it was a part of him now.\n\n“I can’t!” he shouted, his voice breaking. “I can’t get it off!”\n\n“Kyle, we have to go!” I plead while grabbing his arm and pulling him toward the door. But he was frozen, his eyes locked on the ring, his entire body shaking uncontrollably.\n\nAnd then I heard it. A soft, familiar knock.\n\nIt wasn’t coming from the door. It was coming from the window.\n\nI turned while my heart was pounding, and there she was. The same woman, standing just outside the window, her pale face pressed against the glass, and her eyes staring straight at me while smiling. She raised her hand—the hand with the gold ring. Then she tapped softly on the window once more.\n\nKyle screamed.\n\nI grabbed him by the shoulders, shaking him violently, trying to snap him out of whatever trance he was in.\n\n“Kyle! We have to get out of here!”\n\nBut his eyes were wide and glazed over, his lips trembling as he stared at the woman outside.\n\nI turned my head towards the door, then looked back at Kyle for not even a second, now she’s grasping Kyle’s wrist. I screamed, pulling him away with all my strength, but it was like she had an iron grip on him. Kyle’s body went limp, and his eyes rolled back in his head as she pulled him closer to the window.\n\nI was screaming so loudly for help, “Mom! Dad! Help, PLEASE!!!”\n\nMy heart was racing in panic while I fought to hold onto Kyle. Suddenly, the door burst open, and there stood Mom, her face was filled with worry.\n\nI looked around, realizing I was completely alone in the room. My body was drenched in sweat, and my chest heaving as I struggled to catch my breath.\n\n“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Mom said, stepping toward me. “You’re alright.”\n\nIt took me a few seconds to register what was happening. I wasn’t in the house in Ohio. I was in my own bedroom, back in Chicago. The terrifying events that had unfolded were just a nightmare. But it had felt so real—Kyle being dragged through the window, the ghostly woman, the ring. I could still feel the cold sweat on my skin.\n\nDad walked in next, he's a little exasperated, maybe from being woken up.. “What’s goin’ on bud? What happened?”\n\nI stammered, “I…,” still trying to make sense of it all. “I thought she took him… that woman… the house…”\n\nMom sat on the edge of my bed, she brushed the damp hair away from my forehead. “It was just a bad dream,” she said softly, her voice soothing. “You’re safe. You’re home.”\n\n“It felt so real,” I whispered, my voice shaking. “Kyle was with me, and—”\n\nDad cut me off, his voice calm but firm. “It was just a nightmare, son. You’re ok.”\n\nI nodded, still shaken, but their reassurance slowly brought me back to reality. They stayed with me until I calmed down, telling me again and again that it was all in my head. Eventually, I lay back down, exhausted from the ordeal, and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up feeling disoriented but relieved. The nightmare still lingered in the back of my mind, but the daylight helped chase away the lingering fear. I could hear the sounds of breakfast being made downstairs.\n\nI made my way downstairs to join my parents at the table. Mom was pouring coffee, and Dad was reading the newspaper. I sat down and I glanced around the table. Something felt off, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.\n\n“Where’s Kyle?” I asked casually, looking toward the kitchen as if he might walk in any moment.\n\nMom froze mid-pour, her brow furrowing in confusion. She slowly turned to face me, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Who’s Kyle?” she asked, her voice full of genuine puzzlement.\n\nMy stomach dropped. I stared at her, waiting for her to laugh, to tell me she was joking. But she didn’t. Her expression remained blank, as if the name meant nothing to her.\n\n“Kyle,” I repeated, my voice faltering. “My brother. Your son.”\n\nDad lowered his newspaper, just below his eyes. He glanced at me, “What are you talking about?” he said. “You don’t have a brother.”\n\nThe room seemed to spin around me. My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt a cold wave of panic wash over me. “What do you mean I don’t have a brother? Kyle! We were just—last night, he was—”\n\nBut Mom and Dad exchanged worried glances, their confusion deepening. It was as if Kyle had never existed, as if everything I remembered was a lie.\n\nI sat there, my mind racing, trying to understand what was happening. Was this another nightmare? Or had something far more terrifying happened?\n\nPanic surged through me, and I shot up from the table, knocking my chair back with a loud thud. The force of my movement sent Mom’s coffee spilling across the table.\n\n“Hey, are you okay?” Mom asked, bending down to grab the mug.\n\nI didn’t answer. My heart was racing, and I needed to get away. Without a word, I rushed to the spare bathroom downstairs. Once inside, I locked the door behind me. My hands were trembling, my breath shaky. I was confused, overwhelmed, I couldn’t hold back the tears.\n\nWhat is happening? I thought to myself.\n\nI turned on the faucet, splashing cold water on my face, trying to calm down, to think clearly.\n\nAs I wiped my face, something caught my eye—a flash of gold on my hand. I froze.\n\nThe ring.\n\nThe same ring the woman in the house had been wearing. It was on my finger. I felt my breath hitch as a knock sounded at the bathroom door.\n\n“Are you alright in there?” Mom’s voice came through, filled with concern.\n\nI couldn’t respond. My mind was spinning.\n\nKyle. He had been wearing the ring last night too. Is that why they couldn’t remember him?\n\nFrantically, I tugged at the ring, trying to pull it off. It wouldn’t budge. My pulse quickened, and I yanked harder, but it felt like it was stuck—like it was part of me.\n\n“Hey, buddy, what’s goin’ on in there?” Dad called from outside, jiggling the doorknob.\n\nBoth of them were knocking now, their voices muffled but growing more urgent. The sound of their knocking grew louder, each knock thundering in my ears, echoing off the walls, drowning out everything else. My vision blurred, the room spinning around me. I felt lightheaded, like I was about to lose consciousness.\n\nAnd then—suddenly—it all stopped.\n\nThe knocking, the voices. Everything went dead silent.\n\nSomehow, I wasn’t sure why the fear had suddenly drained from me. The pounding in my chest had been replaced by an unexpected calm, a strange sense of peace. It felt odd—unsettling even.\n\nI glanced in the mirror one last time. Everything seemed normal. I told myself it was fine and stepped out of the bathroom.\n\nI walked back into the kitchen; I saw Kyle sitting in his usual spot at the dining table. Dad was there too, reading the newspaper, sipping his coffee. The smell of bacon sizzling on the stove filled the air—Mom was at her usual place every morning, making breakfast.\n\nThat day still lingers in my memory, strangely vivid.\n\nI remember Mom greeting me with her usual cheerful, “Morning, honey,” smiling warmly as she always did.\n\nDad glanced over his glasses and gave me his usual, “Hey bud,” nodding as he took another sip of coffee.\n\nI replied with a “Good morning” to everyone, which was out of character for me. It wasn’t something I typically did.\n\nKyle, his mouth full of food, looked up and asked, “What’s up with you?”\n\nEven now, I don’t know what happened that day. I’m not sure if it was a daymare—a nightmare while awake—or if it was something like hypnagogia.\n\nOr maybe it was something else entirely.\n\nI'm just relieved that everyone is here. Still, there's this nagging feeling deep inside me. I can't quite figure it out, but it feels like this isn't really my life.\n\nAnd the gold ring?\n\nI still wear it. For some reason, I just can’t seem to take it off or part with it."},"465":{"title":"I am a dumb ass before 9 AM and after 3 PM ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fgjevi\/i_am_a_dumb_ass_before_9_am_and_after_3_pm\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I am a dumb ass before 9 am and after 3 pm.

Just like it is impossible for the body not to become tired or exhausted through out the day. So I always tell my clients who seek my genius advice, only between 9 am and 3pm is when I am most intelligent. Then one day I get a client in need of serious advice. He asked it before 8 am and I am not at most intelligent best at that time. So I drive to my office and have a bit of breakfast. \n\nThen as I arrive at my office, somebody covered my office with clocks all over the walls. Some clocks were a little bit ahead while some clocks were a little bit behind. Which clock was telling the right time? And my watch said it was 8:50 AM but what if my watch is wrong? \n\nI needed to make sure and so I did a special blood sacrifice that could only be done at 8:50 AM but nothing happened.

This client of mine needed me at my best and at my most intelligent. The advice he needed had worldly consequences if he made the wrong choice, and even I could have gotten into trouble. So I needed to get this right. \n\nThen the cleaner brought in a strange person who I had never seen before. He told me I could use this strange person to be sacrificed, through a ritual that could only be done at 9 AM. So I sacrificed this strange individual that was brought to me by the cleaner. I knew at that point that it was the cleaner who put all the clocks in my office showing different times. He wanted this strange person to be sacrificed. \n\nWhen I sacrificed the strange person, the ritual worked and a higher dimensional being could be seen and I talked with it for an hour. It gave me advice for the problem my client had. So I knew now that it was 9 am, where I am at my most intelligence."},"466":{"title":"You Should Honor Parents...

He stared at his mother’s evil and narcissistic green eyes, nothing in his own. No indication of sadness, no indication of happiness.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Don’t give me that look! You look like your brother!” the woman screeched, her eyes wide in an attempt to catch something she could use against the boy, so she could wail to his father about it.\n\nThe boy continued staring at his mother, his eyes remaining blank. He felt nothing.\n\nSuddenly, there was the sound of the garage opening, signaling his father’s return. Signaling a hope that perhaps the conflict could be resolved somehow, though it usually involved the boy being forced to apologize to the woman he was forced to call his “mom.”\n\n“I’ll tell him what you did,” the boy said.\n\nWHAM!\n\nThe boy felt his ear and cheek sting and then heat up from the sudden slap. It was unexpected. His glasses clung to his face, only sticking to it due to the eyeglasses strap he always wore. Usually the abuse wasn’t like this. It was mental, emotional, and sometimes even sexual in a way. The woman sought to break her children, to make them obedient.\n\nThe boy slowly looked at the woman, anger flaring his eyes.\n\n“Fuck you.”\n\n…\n\nIt had been a few days since. The boy’s father was trying to help the conflict end. Of course, the woman lied about what happened, painting her son to be the evil one.

Just do it! She’ll only make it worse if you don’t.”\n\n“No, she screwed up, I will never apologize to someone like her.”\n\n“Technically, it was wrong to cuss at her like that… We’re supposed to honor our parents…”\n\n“Yeah, unless they’re abusive pieces of sh*t. Leave.”\n\nThe boy stared blankly at the wall. If one would tell a friend that they cussed at their mother, they would be told that it’s wrong… But in this case, the boy was being abused… Most people wouldn’t understand, though.\n\nThe boy could feel the hot anger bubbling up inside his stomach, urging him to do something. To stop this mistreatment that had been going on for the boy’s entire life. 16 years.\n\n…\n\nIt was dinnertime. The boy and his sister walked down the stairs. Their mother stood up and opened her arms for a hug.\n\nThe boy had no choice. He had to hug her.\n\nHe hugged her and agreed to have peace.\n\nThis had been going on forever. The boy would stand up for himself, then he had to hug the abusive woman he had to call his “mother,” and then pretend that he was wrong.\n\nThe boy took his plate and reluctantly put a piece of salmon on that plate, not enjoying salmon. He took a small piece. He then heard his mother slowly walking up behind him.\n\n“You were wrong, right?” the woman said, looking at the boy, expecting him to agree.\n\nThe boy paused. He wasn’t wrong. He knew it. He knew that she deserved to be cussed at, and to have much worse things.\n\nThis time, his feelings were different.\n\nHe placed the plate on the counter and picked up a knife to cut the salmon, wanting to only have a small piece.\n\n“You should know, you can’t say such things to your mother…”\n\n“You can’t slap your son either,” the boy said.\n\n“Yes, but telling your mother “fuck you” is worse… If I told the police, they’d agree with me.”\n\n“No…”\n\nThe boy could feel the anger boiling inside him.

I recommend you take this in all seriousness while it is regarded in this time as fictional or madness. Ample evidence points to the integrity and constructed metaphysical presence of this creature.\n\nPlease disregard grammatical incongruence. I write in a way to accurately convey a message to the reader independent of modern acceptably.\n\nFour Months Ago Today I entered, not to my knowledge, an infectious and wicked space as I've been stuck, stuck to something, somehow, from this space since then. In many methods I've tried to release this. As, when I first felt it, I left at once, leaving one 25 cent quarter as to pay my respects and depart independent.\n\nIt did not accept this gesture as it is not greedy creature. I now assume the completely obvious, that money has no value to it. I am quite frankly embarrassed and somewhat afraid I was interpreted as disrespectful to assume that is what it desired from me. \n\nAs I've been attached to this presence, I've noticed it, watching me, undoubtedly planning, conscious and boiling. The hair on my neck raises just to even recollect and record these events. And in my own need of identification, all though I cannot see this (plainly or reliably, as I've seen shadows indicating the possiblity of a visual manifestation but these things are vague and often times to quick to process) illness, or touch, as I can only feel it, I've named it, \n\n'THE HAUNT'\n\n, and to shake it seems nearly impossible. Forever I circled around and around this, with no limit. As it's hear now, I ignore it but, the acknowledgement of existence is shared by both of us, even though I do not want it. \n\nAs peaceful as it is, as of now, I have heard it. And it tells me impossible things, things I should not know. It has calculated mathematics from the 4th place to the 2nd decimal, and given me right answers for simple school equations on multiple occasions. Things I did not know how to calculate. Therefore I owe this force, and I was unknowingly unbalancing my dynamic with this encroaching thing. \n\nIt has no tangible sound. It implants knowledge and inflicts itself into my mind as a force of something external, which is somewhat alarming and violating as I have not experienced anything to this extent before.\n\nSo, I may initially seem irrational for deeming this presence as negative, evil, or frightening. However I have known 'angels' and this is different. (I do not intend to associate with any Judasictic or Christiantic beliefs here, I am only defining a certain metaphysical presence with the term 'angel' as they are commonly refered to positive presences unlike that of THE HAUNT)\n\nAngels in my experiences are fragile, and faint, their presence is almost indetectable. They rarely (as I have not experienced this interaction with an angel, but have heard of accounts from others where this type of interaction has occurred) dispel knowledge onto those who manifest in the physical 3D dimension that we interpret and live through. \n\nThe distinguishable factor of THE HAUNT is the intention and the inflection on observable matter. The distinguishable factor is it's from, of making itself known. The distinguishable factor is it is constantly distinguishable, that while it itself is not observable or measurable, it's action on the physical world is. \n\nAnd for what motive, if motive even has a part to play in the actions of it, is unknown. Motive may not even exist in the determinable actions it takes. Motive, is something that drives the mind of the physical, and the course of interaction with the physical. In the materialistic world, people are defined as motivated creatures with pre programed methods of interaction. This cannot be said to creatures exterior of our interpretation on reality.\n\nI do not worship any member of the exterior form of existence as a god or a figure of emese power. I see myself as equal as I assume we both have an equal place in the joint action of all plains of existence. While we have different ways of interacting with different aspects of the observable and unobservable universe, and one form of interaction may affect more than the other, I believe we are both needed as aspects of the macrocosm (please see Plato's accounts on physical and metaphysical representations of the universe, as I cannot go into detail here, but many philosophers from ancient times represent the universe in what I believe to be a very intelligent and thoughtful way, and agree with to a large degree). \n\nAnd so, I am left in quite the strange pattern here. I am attempting to release THE HAUNT, but I am unable to do so, and so in the last few days I have planned on making contact, or attempting to make contract with this creature. And to do so, I've done some limited research into contacting exterior forces in times not limited by the constraints of modern acceptably or modern science. One that has struck me as quite functional is the methods used by the Essene who conversed with Angels (Judaism definition) to (what is generally thought) create the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Essene lived in the veil between what is seen and unseen, and were in touch with the divine. While they are commonly thought to simply be a generator for mysticism, a constantly out of reach but provoking drive to become more in touch with God by the common man, I believe more so that the Essene had reliable (reliability here is up to interpretation) method of abstract communication with the exterior. \n\nWhile I have had simple cause and effect interactions with THE HAUNT, I am left to no choice but to try and open up a method of abstract communication in a similar way of the Essene. I have ample evidence to assume this communication can be done several ways, independent of traditional methods, with the only possible language being mathematics, as this creature has shown itself able to process it. Math, while a language, functions off logic, factors of the physical realm, and is itself the language of the universe. \n\n...\n\nI have recently decided a form of fasted prayer (prayer is intended with a different connotation than the common religious intention here, I am using the word for the description of the action of generating intention and energy, not worship and desire) and mathematical computation beyond cryptography, as simply mathematics itself, may be my best option in attempt to open up a semi-understandable abstract dialogue. I will attempt to open this equally while limiting as much as possible exterior influence or sensory input beyond the mathematic medium itself. I will release another document describing how I will do this on a later date.\n\n09\/13\/24 - X14 \nAlso posted on https:\/\/eleanorbeck.blogspot.com\/2024\/09\/a-message-from-haunt.html?m=1"},"469":{"title":"Werewolf Stories ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fgdy8t\/werewolf_stories\/","flair":"Video","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/c45kp8unhc4\n\nThe Beast of the Amazon Rainforest\n\nSeven friends.

I never got the chance to call and tell them I was all settled in. They lay bleeding out in the street, while I was decorating my room in crimson. It is only because of my roommate Joseph, that I survived.\n\nObviously I was devastated, and spent days straight, hiding under the covers, and alternating between utter rage and abysmal sadness. The only person willing to console me was Joseph, a perfect stranger, who had every right to mind his own business. We would sit, and he would listen while I played Jekyll and Hyde through the five stages of grief. The only things that I ate were prepared by him, and the only human interaction I had revolved around my feelings and his deep brown eyes. He saved me with kindness, compassion, and perfect loyalty. \n\nDuring our talks, he had convinced me to stay and continue school, as I had no home to go back to. I was an only child and my parents were my only relatives, as they were orphaned at a young age and bonded over their struggle in foster care. I had nowhere else to be, so why not stay here and make something of myself, instead of crawling away to a hole to die.\n\n“There is honor in sadness, but not cowardice,” he would say.\n\nAs old fashioned as that sounds, it made sense to me. Joseph was like that, a man out of time. Even now, long after I had climbed out of that hole of destruction, I marvel at the grace he showed in those moments, and contemplated whether or not I would have acted as gallantly. \n\nI knew Joseph was my family now. We are brothers, and I owe him my life.\n\nOn top of babysitting me, he was also able to maintain his grades, and had advocated to the dean on my behalf, delaying the start to my academic year. I’m pretty proud of myself for successfully completing my degree. There is no way I would have finished without Joseph. I used to joke that mine needed both our names on it. \n\nAfter college, we both pursued writing, though in entirely different styles. I used a  weak attempt at capturing a voice in nonfiction as distinct as Anthony Bourdain or Hunter S. Thompson, and it allowed me to live hand to mouth. My brother took it upon himself to expose environmental corruption wherever it may hide. He was no doubt blacklisted by numerous big names in the field of carbon emitting fuels, and I was definitely blacklisted from certain restaurants in NYC. \n\nThe only issue I ever had with Joseph was how little he would tell me of his own family history. We had literally never spoken of it. The only thing he would say was that they lived in Rural Northern California, and that he had left them all behind. After many tries to crack the shell, his insistence on myth overcame. \n\nThe day he called and asked me to join him in attending his sister’s funeral came as a complete shock. And of course, I readily agreed to support him however he needed. \n\nWe met in San Francisco from different parts of the globe, and rented a car to drive the remaining six hours north, to the farthest reaches of the state. As we passed farmland, forested mountain lakes and into the volcanic plains, we didn’t talk much. I knew the drill with him, he would speak when he wanted to talk. \n\n“It’s funny how rocks don’t change, huh”, he said with a grin at the absurdity of the statement. “They were always the only landmarks to look for. My childhood had no street names, only geolocational descriptions in accordance to big rocks. ”\n\nIt was the first thing he’d said to me since he stopped in Weed, a tiny town with a funny name off the 5. I still have that lighter he insisted I buy.\n\n“Well, I can’t say I’m surprised Joe, there are more telephone poles than trees.”\n\nEventually, we turned off the interstate somewhere past a place called Yreka, onto a dirt road and as we did so, Joe’s demeanor began to change. \n\n“My family is different than anything you could imagine, Chuck. The land is different up here. I’m sure you’ve heard of Lemurians?”\n\n“Ya, the people who supposedly live in Mt. Shasta. No fucking way, you’re a Lemurian,” I joked, with widened, fantastical eyes.\n\n“Of course not, but there are people who believe. There are some people who are not wrong to believe there is something different about this place.’\n\nMy eyebrows began to retreat into a more concerned furrow. I’d never known my brother to be irrational. \n\n\"There aren’t people that live “in” the mountain, as far as I know. My parents, and their parents have searched. A community was built out here long ago, searching for the meaning to the mountain, searching to understand the power it can bestow on those that are willing to accept it. Their entire life has been, along with my ancestors, spent looking for the truth that lies out here on these plains at the foot of the volcano. I grew up completely disconnected from society, instead, my family and many others. lived a nomadic lifestyle, out here away from everyone else, looking for the truth to life.”\n\nI had decided to support my brother, in whatever way that I could, as a much younger man after many nights thinking back on our quiet talks, remembering his kindness. I had promised myself I would repay him however I could. I would be there for him, and it was with this in mind that I said:\n\n“Joe that’s fucking crazy.”\n\nHe just smiled grimly. “Now you know why we never talked about it.”\n\nWe spent the next hour jostling down a dirt road that traveled into the horizon unhindered, all the while I asked questions of which he did not answer. It wasn't until he stopped the car on the side of the road that he finally said anything. We sat for a moment in silence, and Joe’s eyes began to well up and he spoke.\n\n“Chuck, I’m sorry it has to be this way. There is no way that I could have explained this to you that would have made sense, but you have to trust me. I will never let anything happen to you. I’m going to need your help here, just do what I ask, and everything will be ok.”\n\nWith that, he opened his door, and beckoned me to do the same. A I slammed my door, gunshots ripped through my ears. Joseph fired a handgun that I was unaware existed into the air three times and I screamed out of shock.\n\n“We need to start walking brother, we can’t miss the funeral,” he said, with brown eyes I had never seen contain so much sadness.\n\nMy mind was made up a long time ago. I drew strength in my choice.\n\n“Sounds good, brother.”\n\nIt took only twenty minutes for the sun to set after we left the car, and I was completely blind; though, I had a good hold on the back of Joe’s coat to help me keep track of him. Joe was locked in on something I couldn’t see and was sure footed in his march to our unknown destination. For an endless amount of time I huffed and puffed and wondered what the hell was happening. Never once did I feel afraid to die, because I trusted Joe, I knew he wouldn’t let anything happen to me.\n\nFor some reason, I felt afraid for Joe. \n\nEventually, a large structure loomed out of the darkness, almost as if by magic. A large yurt made of animal hides was standing prominently, with smaller versions scattered around it. There were torches outside the large yurt, illuminating a towering pillar of smoke emanating from the center of the tent. \n\nTwo men stood outside the main flap, and it was obvious we were expected. Joe saluted the men with his chest in a fashion I’d never seen, and they allowed us to enter. \n\nInside it was tortuously hot, and filled with people, all of whom would look more at home as an extra in a Conan movie than in the state of California. Little naked children ran about, squealing and playing amongst mothers. Bearded men with braided hair and ornamental beads all stopped talking at once when our presence became aware. All of them had weapons, though none looked intent on their use. \n\nIn the middle of the tent, sat two chairs, a pit of coals glowing white, and a large tarped object. This is where all eyes merged as the silence of our arrival rippled through the tent. For a long moment, the fantastically dressed couple seated on the thrones gazed upon Joseph in loving contempt. \n\n“I am pleased to see you still honor our traditions, we weren’t sure you would come,” the king said.\n\n“Of course, father, she was my sister,” he said in measured respect. “Choosing to move on from the mountain does not change my respect for it… for what it has given us. I am here to honor my sibling. I chose to walk another path, not forget who I am. ”\n\nThe throned man accepted this, and turned to me.\n\n“Do you speak English?”\n\n“Er, yeah. I do,” I finally choked through my astonishment at the whole situation. \n\n“Very well, no time to waste,” he said and clapped his hands together. Immediately a whirl of motion began, as drums beat in earnest. We were pulled bodily, made to move around the center pit. The entire tent groaned throatally together in unison as they undulated together. Next to me, I could hear Joe doing the same, a sound emitting from his chest rather than his mouth, it infected the room and vibrated the yurt in an orchestra of humanity. Strongly, he grabbed my hand and led me to the pit, the mass parting for us, hurrying us toward his mother and father and the shrouded shape. All the while the heat grew as we moved closer to the pit, descending down into the fires,  the thrones and coals. \n\nNow that I could see, I realized they were not coals, but rocks being super heated by the earth. The volcano, tangible to those who dare.\n\nWe stood in front of the thrones, holding hands, as Joe’s father began to speak in a deep tone that captured the energy of the junilation and as the beating of the drums crescendoed, he boomed. \n\n“Finally, the lost son has returned. We are glad to have him, are we not?”\n\nThe entire tent chanted YES.\n\nThe King continued: “Joseph, tell of your sister. Tell of her glory.”\n\nAfter a moment, Joseph, in an equally stunning voice, rejoined. “Marian understood the circle. She understood family. She gave all for me, so that I may try and make a more direct change for our home, for our forgotten brothers and sisters. She is beautiful and wise. She is a worthy voice returned to the many.”\n\nSeemingly satisfied, Joseph’s father said:\n\n“You accepted the gift, Joseph. It is because of your sister that you are allowed to lead the life you do. She took up your burden. Have you made yourself worthy of this gift?”\n\n“That is not for me to decide.”\n\nThe King was surprised, and proud of this.\n\n“Then it is only right that you complete her cycle. From the fires, to the fires, again. \n\n“Yes,” Joseph said, looking at the shrouded figure, tears flowing down his face. \n\nThe king turned and whipped the shroud away to reveal the crucified remains of Joseph's sister, mottled green and black from days of decomposition. She looked just like Joe, the resemblance would not be betrayed by the rot. Ornately, she had been sliced at the naval and her entrails lay draped amongst a small bouquet of flowers at her feet. The heat, the smells and the sight all culminated in the most intense case of nausea imaginable, and I released it into the pit adding the aroma. I felt like I was going to suffocate, until I felt Joe’s calming touch on my back. I wiped my mouth and stood up straight, remembering that this was a funeral.\n\nThe king, looking directly at me, continued his speech:\n\n“Upon the backs of your brothers, Upon the backs of your sisters, is carried the future of our people. When we become one in that belief, then are we granted the strength of our ancestors. Marian understood this, she sacrificed greatly for Joe in his steed. Her brother chose to lead a path away from the mountain, and her love for him burned brightly while he was wayward; because of this, her life energy collapsed prematurely. Now Joseph, you are here to pay that debt.  Are you here to carry your sister, as she has carried you?”\n\nJoe looked at me, braced himself, and nodded, his father approaching us.. \n\n“And, this,” he pointed at me.”Who is this?”\n\n“This is my brother. He is us. He has stared at death and overcome, a warrior unto his own right.”\n\nThe King looked upon me, unmoved.\n\n“I see.”\n\n“He is,” Joseph said with force, and it gave me strength.\n\n“Very well, Prepare them then.”\n\nI was immediately seized, as the drums beat again. Joe and I were moved on a wave of men,  as they tore at our clothes, ripping everything away from me. I fought and screamed for Joe, who merely repeated: “Trust me brother, trust me.”\n\nNaked, we both were placed in front of the pit, the king booming as the drums beat rhythmically, the masses groaning in unison. \n\n“Bound by flesh, these brothers. As those of us are before. A debt paid in flesh deserves return, honor, again restored..”\n\nWith this, the king reached into the gut pile and began feeding the innards onto the rocks, the sizzle proving what I already knew. Calmly, with his bare hands, this father feeds his daughter into the fire. Stone is the face of the king as he says goodbye to his daughter. \n\n“Now, Joseph, kneel before your sister.”\n\nJoseph does what he is told, and kneels naked into the fire in front of what is left of his sister; not a sound escapes his lips as he surrenders his tender flesh to the mountain. \n\n“Lie with your sister, son,” the king yells over the cacophony.\n\nAnd without hesitation Joe falls face first into the pit, lying there motionless. After an eternity, he rolls aways, steaming and silent. The burns were indescribable, and as the smoke cleared it reveals that his sister and he had become one in the inferno. \n\nI ran to his side, looking to embrace where I could, not knowing where he began or the burns ended. My heart ached for him as he lay there smoldering in the dirt, looking up to his father’s approving eyes. His son was an honorable man, and had proved so again. \n\n“Your brother needs you now, take him upon your back; as he has no doubt done for you.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, turning to look at his face, tears evaporating from my cheeks. \n\nI picked up my brother’s naked and mutilated body and draped him over myself, knowing what my purpose in the funeral was. I walked from the yurt, through the pitch black night, unclothed, as our skin, charred and soft, combined through the rigor. Somehow, I marched us back to the car, though the strength by which I achieved this feat did not come from me, but rather through me. I spoke with Joseph about everything we knew, keeping us company in the cold still, moonless prairie, but only his gusting breath in my ear proved his vitality. It was daybreak when I finally made it to the car, and had to peel myself away from my brother.\n\nJoseph made me promise not to take him to the hospital, as he lay mushing into the seat of our rental car. Obviously, I thought that was insane, but at the moment, insanity wasn't a definable concept to me, so I plowed through the night back to Weed and found a motel. \n\nThrough crackling, ragged breaths, he instructed me to fill the tub with ice, to lay him down upon it, and leave him until his call. I’m still not sure how he was able to convince me, but I did what he asked, I felt like I had to, even though I was almost certain that I was laying him down to die an agonizing death. \n\nFor three days, I sat in the room next to his tub, absolutely driving myself insane. I tried to write down everything that I had experienced, if only to prove to myself it couldn’t have happened. Writing and rewriting, trying to find words to put to the experience, trying to put a voice to ideas that only seemed to live in a feverish nightmare I had imagined. \n\nFinally, after I had lost all hope, my brother spoke to me; an urgency flashed through my being and I knew it was time. I flew through the door of our motel room to find him unburned, though aged markedly. His joy at my sight thronged vibrantly in my soul, this newly felt connection exciting and terrifying. Though we were alone in the room, I now felt the presence of many others.\n\n“Upon the backs of your brothers, Upon the backs of your sisters, is carried the future of our people.”\n\nIt took a few more days for us to leave, and before we did we drove out to the mountain so we could say goodbye. There was no sign of the family. We returned the rental car, and paid a horrific cleaning fee for what became of the backseat. I wouldn’t be surprised if I was blacklisted there as well. \n\nThat was the last time I had actually heard from Joe. Ten years without a spoken word, yet our bond informs me of him. We are connected through family, through voices in the aether. Which is why, a couple days ago, I could feel the news hit him, and then me. His call a few minutes later confirmed what I had already known. \n\nMy life's goal was to explain how I felt about my parents death to the world– I wanted to show through sarcastic wit and charm that I was not affected by the loss of my family. Stupidly, I tried to forget my past and start anew, instead of accepting and growing with who I now carried with me. After the funeral of my half-sister, a new chapter opened in my life, one that has led to a sense of inner peace and acceptance.\n\nA few days ago Joseph's father died, and it is time for another funeral. It’s time to help my brother prove his worth again. \n\n“Upon the backs of our brothers, Upon the backs of our sisters, is carried the future of our people.”\n\n\n\n\n"},"472":{"title":"Cringe.

Loves games, mostly Zelda, the works. He instantly falls in love with the idea of fostering Ben, because he's a teenager. Teens are less likely to be adopted so he'd give it a shot. \n\nIt'll start as relatively tense. Ben will have been \"returned\" so many times before, and would be hesitant on bonding with Tim. Scared, even. But with time, Ben will be very close to Tim, even call him \"dad\". Very slow burn (platonic).\n\nRules and Regulations: \n\n- I am 22 and would prefer RPing with 18+. Even though this Roleplay will be non-sexual it still technically counts as NSFW for mental health and potential violence due to the MH nature and I will not be comfortable role-playing with minors.\n\n- I mainly use discord. I write in Third Person. Past or present tense doesn't matter to me. My replies vary depending on the circumstances; whether it be a dialogue heavy scene, or less actions to be made, etc. I will not lie, I can be very terrible when it comes to descriptive paragraphs. That's why I prefer text-like role-playing, BUT I can do novella with relative ease. As long as you don't mind variation in responses.\n\n- I am more comfortable playing Ben. I am searching for someone to play Tim Wright.

The legend dates back centuries, whispered from generation to generation. They say the cart is a ghostly remnant of an old executioner’s wagon, cursed to roam the streets at night, searching for the souls of those who have sinned. The cart’s appearance is always a bad omen, a sign that death is near. But no matter how many times I heard the story, I never really believed it. Not until a few days ago at least.\r\r\n\nIt was one of those nights when sleep felt like a distant memory, I sat by my room's window, watching the empty street below. My neighborhood is usually silent, not exactly quiet because night itself seems to be alive in a way, the sounds of the wind, night animals and a peaceful yet somber atmosphere is what one might expect; however, this one night around 4 AM, that  usual nightlife was murdered by a sudden and heavy change in its atmosphere. \n\nAt first I felt an overwhelming sense of cold, like the warmth was being sucked out of my body and out of everything surrounding me, I saw my windows started to fog up, outside I also saw a heavy fog coming from what seemed to be nowhere. \r\rThen came that sound, an ominous sound. It was just like a faint creaking, like an old door being slowly opened; but the sound grew louder, deeper and heavier until it felt like the entire world was groaning in agony. Then came the sound of chains... huge, rusted chains dragging along the pavement, clanking in a rhythm that made my skin crawl.\r\rI didn't want to, but every cell in my body screamed at me to look outside, like an intrusive thought that just seemed to slowly take control of my actions. What happened next is something I will forever regret from now until the day I die, which may be sooner than I thought.\n\nIt was there, The Screeching Cart, I saw as it emerged from the fog that had rolled in, its massive, rotting wooden frame that seemed to barely hold together. The wheels were warped and uneven, each turn producing a hideous screech that pierced the stillness of the night. The cart’s planks were cracked and splintered, with large gaps revealing glimpses of something dark and writhing inside, something that I couldn’t, and didn’t want to fully see. It seemed, contrary to folklore, to be moving by its own, though I might be wrong given the fact that the cart itself drew on all my attention, what I am 100% sure is this: there was no driver.\r\r\n\nThere was this aura around the cart that seemed thick, suffocating, as if the night itself was being swallowed by the darkness that surrounded it.\r\rThe screeching... it wasn’t just a sound. It was a feeling, a vibration that rattled my bones and made my teeth ache. It was as if the cart was tearing through reality itself, leaving nothing but despair in its wake. The sound burrowed into my mind, each turn of the wheels sending waves of nausea and dread through my body. I wanted to look away, to run, but I couldn’t. I was trapped, a prisoner of my own fear.\n\nMy heart pounded so hard I thought it might explode, and every breath was a struggle, like the air had thickened into something solid. It felt like the cart was pulling something from me, something vital, but I couldn’t tell what. All I knew was that I was fading, becoming less, as the cart moved on.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it appeared, The Screeching Cart disappeared into the fog, taking its horrifying sounds with it. The silence that followed was deafening, oppressive, as if the world was holding its breath. I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat. My chest was tight, my skin clammy, and my mind a whirlwind of terror and confusion. I could barely think, let alone move.\r\r\n\nToday, the feeling hasn’t left me. My heart still races at every little sound, and there’s a constant chill in the air, no matter how many blankets I wrap around myself. I can still hear the faint echoes of the cart’s screeching in the back of my mind, like a distant, horrible memory that refuses to fade. \n\nI’m terrified to sleep, but I’m even more terrified of what will happen if I don’t. The Screeching Cart came for me last night, and I know it’s not done with me yet. I know I’m going to die, so this will be my first and last log in here. I know I will die soon because when I started typing this post, I heard a screech."},"482":{"title":"The ghost landlord wants me to pay rent","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ffnh9r\/the_ghost_landlord_wants_me_to_pay_rent\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"The ghost landlord demands that I pay rent, and I broke into some abandoned house because I've really hit rock bottom in life.

He had something bloody in his bag, and it was his own leg. \n\nHe chopped it off to give it to me as ghost landlords require something much more as rent. There was something about this man and as I accepted his cut off leg, he hopped away slowly. Then the ghost landlord was happy that I paid his rent. The ghost landlord started fixing the house up and it looked amazing. There was heating, electricity and food. This ghost land lord isn't so bad and he is better than most living landlords. I had a wonderful house all to myself. \n\nI would still get the random individuals coming up to my door, and they were giving me their chopped off limbs. I had no idea where they came from and I know had two legs and two arms. Then one day someone had given me their chopped off body.

Then somebody gave me their head as rent fit the ghost landlord. I was so happy. \n\nThen a thought came, the ghost landlord had a full body now. All of the limbs, body and head were floating and they attached themselves to each other. The ghost landlord went inside the body and he now had a new body to live in. The ghost landlord had resurrected himself. \n\nHe simply walked out as a new person and the abandoned house, looked exactly like before.

There was this local pub we visited often, even though it was a real dive bar; dirty floors, dirty tables. But as a student, cheap beer is cheap beer, and ambience is merely an afterthought.\n\nSo there we were, three of us girls and a couple of guys, talking with our spirits quite high. Suddenly I got the urge to visit the ladies' room, so I prepared to face the unwashed toilet. \n\nA peculiarity of the pub was that you could peep into the storage room through a small opening in the wall while heading into the bathrooms. Normally there was nothing to see, just crates of spirits and such, but this time a figure caught my eye. There was a young woman sitting on a crate. Her posture was awful, her hair was matted and she looked sickly. She was concentrating on something and hadn't noticed me. I stood quietly and tried to see what she was doing. I let out an audible gasp when I saw that she was handcuffed, and she was twisting her hands in a desperate attempt to get free. I tried to whisper to her that I would call the police to help her, but she didn't seem to hear me. I quickly returned to my friends and told them that we needed to call the cops and go. \n\nThe cops arrived and searched the place, but the woman I saw was nowhere to be found. The owner was surprisingly chill even though I had practivally accused him of kidnapping of human trafficking and told the cops that I had just seen his wife grabbing something from the storage and nothing more. The only problem with that story was that the wife looked nothing like the woman I saw. The cops found absolutely no trace of the woman, and told me to lay off true crime stories. But I know what I saw. Needless to say, I never went back there."},"488":{"title":"TheTrainzMan2004","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ffmw5u\/thetrainzman2004\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"elchavoislife","selftext":"During 2012 or 2014 I used to watch a lot of Thomas videos but not ones from the official channel but one made by the fans of the show, I remember watching this channel called \"TheTrainzMan2004\" he created a lot of Thomas videos using trains. He would make remakes of episodes, memes, and even his own stories.

It is a dangerous romance, a razor thin line between logic and lust. This is something I have struggled with, and have blamed on my father for my entire life, because at least, that way, I had an excuse to keep doing it. If this curse was handed down to me, I’m a victim. I don’t have to think about how much I enjoy destroying myself, because it was inevitable. \n\n\n\nHis true love claimed him when I was 16, after he drunk drove his truck through the front of our house, blaring sirens in hot pursuit. Rather than face another DUI, he decided to try and beat the cops back to our house. The last things that went through his head were “see, I told you I could make it back”, then windshield glass, and finally, I’d assume, the family photos that hung on the wall over the couch. Wearing a seat belt would have saved him, but we were thankful he hadn’t. We wouldn’t have been able to afford his legal fees. \n\n\n\nThat image, the front of his work truck lighting up my mangled father’s corpse, draining into the carpet where I watched cartoons and ate cereal, it still comes to me whenever I see the red and blue of police lights at night. I have never drunk and driven, though there have been many times I have been tempted out of convenience or shame. \n\n\n\nHowever, this did not stop my love affair, no, It just gave it purpose. Now my desire was justified by genetics and tragedy, and you can bet I wallowed in it. I lied, begged and disappointed myself all the way to this point: divorced, unemployable, and medium sober, sitting at a run down motel desk and asking myself if what just happened, happened.\n\n\n\nBecause I just got a ride home from the bar, and my father was my DD.\n\n\n\nAs I said, luck hasn’t been on my side as of late, I’ve been living hand to mouth on the alimony my ex wife pays for at least a year. That is, until my cousin called and told me he had a job lined up for me, I just needed to get there and be sober. I packed up, recycled all the empties in my Safari for gas money, and made a beeline for the coast.\n\n\n\nI was making good time, so I decided to stop for a bit at the Gilded Feather and play a few hands of blackjack. Before you judge, I only had a beer, which was pretty impressive considering I went on a run that had me walking out with over $500 of the tribe's money. Happiness hadn’t felt this crisp to me in a very long time, and I was proud of myself for waving off the waitress when she came to freshen me up. This is a new start, maybe I can finally turn this boat around.\n\n\n\nThe only road to the coast is a two-lane highway over a mountain pass. If I had been driving a Miata instead of a busted van from the 90’s that sounded like a destruction derby car, I’d imagine it would have been a fun, scenic affair. All I could think about was what would happen to me if she dropped dead and left me walking through a country that has murals of Bigfoot on the side of their grocery store. \n\n\n\nI had no issue pulling into a tiny town just before nightfall, and I didn’t want to risk my luck turning on the other side of the mountain. Then, remembering the cash burning a hole in my pocket, I sent a text to my cousin telling him I would be there first thing in the morning and rented a room for the night. \n\n\n\nThe only place to eat was a bar about a mile outside of town. The plan was to leave at 5am and drive the last 75 miles or so to make my first day of work, and I wanted to be clear headed tomorrow morning, so I pinky promised myself that I wouldn’t drink too much. The drive over to the aptly named “Consumption Junction” took five minutes. Hey, a man has to eat, it couldn’t be helped that the only restaurant had a bar. \n\n\n\nThe locals were very friendly; as I’d imagine they don’t often get new drinking buddies here. The crowd was my type, barflys that stare into the glass of whatever their favorite well liquor is and chase it down with a beer back. Our livers have no time for mixers, and sugar will give us diabetes. \n\n\n\nEventually, the remaining four of us who had bonded over shots and rock and roll bands from our past, were informed it was closing time. My billfold was filled with $50 and scribbled on pieces of napkin with phone numbers of people I would never speak to again.\n\n\n\nIt was then that I began to recognize that familiar feeling of disappointment, when it becomes apparent that your actions and your intentions differ. I’d lost count of my drinks, I couldn’t drive, and all of my shit was back at the motel, too, so I couldn’t just sleep here and take off in a few hours. My well laid plan had been fucked by mice.\n\n\n\nThis, surprisingly, is where I begin to question my own memories. \n\n\n\nAgonizingly I pondered my options, and decided the valiant, noble, thing to do would be walk the mile back to the room, grab my stuff, and walk back to the van. Hopefully, I will have enough time to sober up and be at work on time. My cousin had stuck his neck out for me, and I had swore I was deserving of this risk. It wasn’t the worst situation I had found myself in by a long shot, nor would it be the first time I’d gone to work after an all nighter. In hindsight, I should have just slept in the van and picked up my clothes on the way out of town. What can I say, I was shit-faced.\n\n\n\nPeople take for granted the notion of streetlights. I’d imagine it’s not too often that modern folk find themselves outside, at night, in a place only lit by the moon. The pale light plays tricks on your mind. I felt this truth more and more as I drunkenly ambled down the highway at 2:30am in the middle of nowhere. I was a lonely soul, and I felt it. \n\n\n\nMy right foot kept finding loose rocks and I kept finding myself in the muddy ditch. Within a half hour of my trek I had made it around the first bend in the road. I could not see any lights off in the distance. The only hint of civilization was the existence of the highway that kept wandering out from under my legs. \n\n\n\nI was completely soaked by the next bend, after falling face first into the stinkiest pool of water in existence. In that moment I was thankful for the darkness, as I would rather keep the mystery of what I was swimming in alive, instead of knowing the foulness of its contents.\n\n\n\nThe realization I had left my phone in my van to charge hit me about an hour into my journey (a complete guess as I am thoroughly convinced I had walked for three hours at least). I remember sitting on the side of the road for a while to cry. The rollercoaster of emotions became too much for me, my loneliness so complete, as there would be no one for me to call for help had I even thought to bring it.\n\n\n\nI remember wishing someone would drive by and take pity on me; I just needed to get to my room and take a shower. I would be a better man then. \n\n\n\nIn the distance ahead of me, a light appeared. Blinding in the blackness that my eyes were accustomed to. Angelic. Divine. I was saved. The prayer of a drunk, answered. So, I yelled out in the dark, yelled for salvation. Signaled, with earnest, as this Titanic survivor had glimpsed the Carpathia and would never be left behind. \n\n\n\nThe high pitched whine of an old transmission downshifting was music to my ears. A Ford Ranger from the 1970’s with a caved in front end pulled up alongside me. I was glad for the state of it, as I wouldn’t have to feel so bad for my muddiness. \n\n\n\nIt was dark in the cab, so my savior remained a mystery. When I turned to put on my seatbelt, it became apparent there were none. \n\n\n\n“Thank you so much, I’ve been out there forever,” I said honestly. \n\n\n\nThe only reply came from the truck as it began to lurch forward slowly, the dark man shifting smoothly without using the clutch, like a truck driver from the past. \n\n\n\n“My dad had a truck just like this,” I remember saying to him. Ignored, again, as the man just continued to pick up speed, shifting.\n\n\n\n“His Ranger didn’t have seatbelts either,” I said, finishing my thought about how useful they would have been in my head. “That bar is a lot farther from town than it looks. It took me five or so minutes to get there in my van, but I’ve been walking for hours.”\n\n\n\nI was startled by his voice. “You come from the bar?”\n\n\n\n“Ya, from Consumption,” a little chuckle from the night's festivities regarding its origin blossoming in my brain now that fear had gone to bed.\n\n\n\n“Umph,” was the noise he made, shifting and accelerating. I began to notice the trees whipping past us now. \n\n\n\nI wasn’t sure what gear we were in as the speedometer read 75. The fear was awake and I wished to be back with my stinky puddle again. \n\n\n\n“You must know these roads well, like the back of your hand,” I said, trying to tactfully broach the subject of our unbelievable speed. I may have been drunk, but I’m a professional, and even  incapacitated I would have realized there was no way he could be making these corners without braking. All I could do was hold on as this mad man pressed harder on the gas pedal and changed gear. \n\n\n\n“Hey man, this isn’t cool. What the hell are you doing?”\n\n\n\nHe pressed on, unaffected by my obvious distress.\n\n\n\n“You smell like liquor, son.” \n\n\n\n“Well ya, I was at the bar, man. Slow down!”\n\n\n\n“**They buy you drinks**,” he spat into the steering wheel. **“Did you take liquor from them in there**?!”\n\n\n\nThe sudden change from the shadowed man caused me to piss his seat. I was absolutely terrified, and drunk, and hurtling down a two lane mountain road with a complete stranger. I can remember looking into his face, straining to see him, and only finding darkness. It was as if he wore a  black hole as a mask. I recognized the rage, I had worked my entire life to drink away its place in my childhood.\n\n\n\n“**Is this what you wish for your memory? Answer me boy**!”\n\n\n\nHe shifted, again.\n\n\n\n“**Look into yourself! Is there anyone left to remember you? When this truck stops, will there be anyone to make sure you are put to rest**,” he screamed in the cab of the truck. \n\n\n\nAnd continued shifting, his left hand furiously moving back and forth on the wheel guiding us, though it felt like the truck was on rails. There were no longer trees flying by, as now the entirety of our surroundings had become a blur outside the truck. \n\n\n\nMy hands, searching for a solid place to brace, moved to his dashboard, pleading for security. \n\n\n\n“**Consumption leads to rot**,” he bellowed. “**All dead things rot**!”\n\n\n\nI crunched something in my clasping hands and pulled it to my face, only to recognized my own countenance staring back at me. It was a faded picture of me and my family, standing outside our house, all waving and smiling for the camera. \n\n\n\nI looked at the man's face, and only saw my imagination.\n\n\n\n“**Glory to those that know their place, that know they are a burden on those they love, and look to pay that debt**.”\n\n\n\n“Dad?” \n\n\n\nThis picture was real, I could feel it in my hands. Behind those waving smiling faces is a broken home, behind that broken family would lay a crumbling house. The overalls, stained in a familiar pattern. Those hands, gnarled into clubs from work, were used to teach me better.\n\n\n\nI could smell Copenhagen and beer in the cab of the truck, body odor overpowering Old Spice. I  knew where I was. I knew who I was riding with. \n\n\n\nI know where we’re going, as I had visited it often in my nightmares.\n\n\n\nAnd I began yelling: “You’re right. Like father, like son, huh! I thought that just because I never drunk and drove I was better than you, that because I never had kids and beat ‘em that we weren’t the same. Yet here we are. Here we are, alone and hurtling drunk down the road in your truck. You win, are you happy, dad? Just like old times, except this time I get to be drunk too!”\n\n\n\nMy throat burned along with my eyes, tears and sweat and alcohol came out of me as I unloaded everything that I hid from myself onto the man that left me behind. I screamed. And I screamed. And I screamed. \n\n\n\nAnd he facelessly shifted and swerved. In anticipation and sheer hysteria  I began baiting him. \n\n\n\n“That spot looks good, right there. Come on, any tree will do, just make sure it's solid. I don’t want to limp away from this, dad.”\n\n\n\nReaching under the seat, I found the emergency beer I was looking for. The one that I knew from experience would be there.\n\n\n\n“Look at you, pops, still a man after my own heart,” and as I cracked it, worms began to flow out of the can. They began to burrow into my legs, righteous agony driving out my hysteria and replacing it with raw unadulterated horror.\n\n\n\n“Oh my god, Dad, please help me.” A broken child swatting at something wicked and looking for their parent’s salvation. “I need you to save me!”\n\n\n\n“**There is nothing to save. You look to fill your hollowness with vice and sin! What would be left for you? You know what you are, and drink yourself into oblivion to hide from it.**”\n\n\n\nI could no longer hear the engine. It was just my father’s voice and the tunnel of our collective fury. We, together, hurtled down the road toward our destination, one already knowing the way, the other waiting to see how to get there. After looking into the face of the monster driving my father’s truck again, gazing deep into the blackness, I closed my eyes and accepted my fate. \n\n\n\nI woke up in a gully, completely soaked and disoriented, and about fifteen feet off the shoulder of the highway. I had been laying there for a while, as my hands were pruney from the water and I was dreadfully cold. It wasn’t until I made it back to my motel room and stripped naked in front of the mirror did I see the true extent of my injuries, though I had felt them on the way.\n\n\n\nBlack and blue covered my shoulders and chest, all decorated with thousands of little cuts. My thighs, ravaged by little pin sized holes, oozing.\n\n\n\nMy face got it the worst, as both my eyes are almost swollen shut and there is a massive gash across my forehead. If I didn’t know any better, I’d suggest I went through someone's windshield.\n\n\n\nOf course, that’s ridiculous, there was no accident anywhere near where I woke up, not that I looked very hard, admittedly. Call it a hunch when I walk back to get my van, I won’t see any wrecks being hauled off. They cleaned it up a long time ago, I watched them in my pajamas doing it. \n\n\n\nThe sun is coming up, and I’m going to miss my first day of work. Oh well, that bridge was stupidly built of flammable material, anyways.\n\n\n\nBut I wanted to sit and type this all out, before I can shower and sleep away this nightmare. It’s more likely than anything I fell down during my journey home and tried to break the fall with my face. The hill I had to climb up to get back on the tarmac was so steep, it took a few tries, and there were plenty of rocks for me to find.\n\n\n\nThese visions are so vivid, though. They feel so real. I hadn’t thought of the inside of his truck in so long. The beer under the seat was something my brain would have had to dig deep in the files for in order to turn it against me. This is far beyond rock bottom, and deep into the bedrock separating our realm from hell. That black hole face looked into me and was disgusted. \n\n\n\nReal or not, it’s time for change. If there is anyone out there that has experienced something like this, please let me know. Obviously, anyone I tell will dismiss it because of my disease, because of my reputation. So I post this for all of you, who don’t know me, to see if all of this was a terrible power nap after another night of drinking. I think I’ll use this little shard of broken glass I found in my hair as a reminder. \n\n\n\nThanks dad, for helping the only way you knew how.\n\n"},"490":{"title":"The sound in the attic ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ff4x95\/the_sound_in_the_attic\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"tipottinos","selftext":"**The Sound in the Attic**\n\nI used to laugh at people who said their houses were haunted. You know, the usual stuff: flickering lights, strange noises in the night, objects moving on their own. I thought it was all just a mix of paranoia and an overactive imagination. But then...something happened in my own house, and I’m not so sure anymore.\n\nI had just moved into this old, two-story home in a quiet, suburban neighborhood. The place wasn’t anything special—1950s architecture, hardwood floors that creaked when you walked, and an attic that the previous owners said they never used. They said it was \"just for storage,\" but it looked like they hadn’t set foot up there in decades. \n\nThe first few weeks were uneventful. I’d come home from work, make dinner, and settle into my new life. But then one night, I heard something. A faint scraping noise, like wood rubbing against wood. At first, I brushed it off as the house settling. It’s old, after all. But the sound didn’t go away. In fact, it started getting louder, more insistent.\n\nIt was coming from the attic.\n\nI’m not proud to admit that I ignored it for a few days. I didn’t want to know what was up there, and honestly, I assumed it was just a rat or something. But then, one night, the noise changed. It wasn’t a scraping sound anymore. It was more like...footsteps. Slow, deliberate footsteps, pacing back and forth above my bedroom ceiling.\n\nThat night, I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening. I kept telling myself that it was my imagination, that old houses make weird noises all the time. But deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.\n\nThe next morning, I decided to check it out. I grabbed a flashlight, pulled down the rickety attic ladder, and climbed up. The air up there was thick with dust, and the wooden beams groaned under my weight. It was exactly what you’d expect an old attic to look like—boxes piled in the corners, cobwebs hanging from the rafters, and that strange, musty smell. But there was nothing unusual. No sign of animals, no broken windows where something could have gotten in. Nothing.\n\nI figured I must have been hearing things. But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye. On the far side of the attic, partially hidden behind an old dresser, was a small wooden door. I hadn’t noticed it before. It was about three feet high, like a crawlspace door, with rusted hinges and a thick padlock hanging from it.\n\nI didn’t like the look of that door. There was something about it that made my skin crawl. But curiosity got the better of me. I walked over to it, bent down, and tried the padlock. It was solid, unmoving. I gave the door a shove, but it didn’t budge. The thing was sealed tight.\n\nI left the attic that day, trying to put it out of my mind. But the footsteps didn’t stop. In fact, they got worse. It was as if something—or someone—was pacing right above me, night after night. Sometimes it sounded like two people, walking in sync, their footsteps echoing through the house.\n\nThen the knocking started.\n\nIt was faint at first. A light tap-tap-tap on the attic floorboards, right above my bed. But each night, it got louder, more aggressive. One night, it sounded like fists pounding against the wood. I was losing sleep, my nerves shot, until I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nI called an exterminator, thinking maybe there was some kind of animal infestation I wasn’t seeing. He came by, checked the attic, and said there was no sign of rodents or pests. But when he saw the small door, his face went pale.\n\n“That door… shouldn’t be there,” he muttered, almost to himself.\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of houses like this. That’s not a crawlspace. It looks like someone blocked something off, locked it away.”\n\nI didn’t ask any more questions. I didn’t want to know. After he left, I tried to forget about the attic. But the knocking, the footsteps—it all kept getting worse. I even tried sleeping in a different room, but it didn’t matter. The sounds followed me.\n\nFinally, I decided to do something I’d been avoiding since the day I moved in: I called a locksmith. \n\nWhen he arrived, I brought him up to the attic and pointed to the door. He looked at me like I was crazy. “You sure you wanna open this?”\n\nI nodded.\n\nIt took him about twenty minutes to break the padlock. I’ll never forget the moment he swung that door open. The smell hit us first—this rancid, sour stench that made me gag. But what really got me was the space behind the door. It wasn’t a crawlspace. It was a small room, barely big enough to stand in, with no windows, no light, and dirt-covered walls.\n\nAnd on the floor, I saw it: a small wooden rocking chair, turned over on its side.\n\nI didn’t stick around after that. I grabbed a few essentials and left that house within the hour. I sold it at a loss a few months later, to a guy who didn’t ask too many questions.\n\nBut sometimes, at night, I still hear it. That faint sound of footsteps, pacing back and forth, just above my head.\n\nI live in an apartment now. No attic.\n\nBut the sound...it follows me."},"491":{"title":"Someone help me find this creepy pasta \/ scary story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fevwwd\/someone_help_me_find_this_creepy_pasta_scary_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Plus-Tip3651","selftext":"I think it was the dark somnium that posted it.

A sort of \"graveyard Challenge\" if you will. Essentially, it's an obscure track that feels off and there's just a guy talking in a sort of manic way repeating the same thing, which eventually leads to him freaking out and screaming as though someone is unaliving him, followed by silence and then more distorted screaming.

Twenty-three years I'd worked at Hartley's Family Slaughterhouse, and the smell of blood and offal had become as familiar to me as my own sweat. I'd started there fresh out of high school, desperate for any job that would pay the bills. Now, at forty-one, I couldn't imagine doing anything else.\n\nThe work was hard, grueling even, but there was a simplicity to it that I appreciated. Day in and day out, I'd stand at my station, knife in hand, and do what needed to be done. The animals came in alive and left as neatly packaged cuts of meat. It wasn't pretty, but it was honest work.\n\nHartley's wasn't a big operation. We served the local community, processing livestock from the surrounding farms. Old man Hartley had run the place since before I was born, and his son Jim had taken over about a decade ago. It wasn't glamorous, but it was steady work, and in a small town like ours, that counted for a lot.\n\nI remember the day everything changed. It was a Tuesday, unseasonably cold for September. I'd just finished my shift and was heading out to my truck when I saw Jim standing in the parking lot, looking like he'd seen a ghost.\n\n\"Everything alright, boss?\" I called out, fishing my keys from my pocket.\n\nJim startled, as if he hadn't noticed me approaching. \"Oh, hey Mike. Yeah, everything's... fine. Just fine.\"\n\nI'd known Jim long enough to know when he was lying. \"Come on, Jim. What's eating you?\"\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. \"We got an offer today. To buy the plant.\"\n\nI felt my stomach drop. \"What? Who'd want to buy us out?\"\n\n\"Some big corporation. Nexus Protein Solutions, they call themselves.\" Jim shook his head. \"Never heard of them before, but they're offering way more than this place is worth. Dad's thinking of taking the deal.\"\n\n\"But what about the workers? What about the community?\" I couldn't keep the concern out of my voice.\n\nJim shrugged helplessly. \"They say they'll keep everyone on. Modernize the place, increase production. Could be good for the town, bring in more jobs.\"\n\nI wanted to argue, to tell him it was a bad idea, but I could see the defeat in his eyes. The decision had already been made.\n\nThree weeks later, Hartley's Family Slaughterhouse became a subsidiary of Nexus Protein Solutions. At first, not much changed. We got new uniforms, sleek black affairs with the Nexus logo emblazoned on the back. Some new equipment was brought in, shiny and efficient. But the work remained largely the same.\n\nThen came the new protocols.\n\nIt started small. We were told to wear earplugs at all times on the kill floor. When I asked why, the new floor manager – a severe woman named Ms. Vance – simply said it was for our own protection. I didn't argue; the constant bellowing of cattle and squealing of pigs had long since damaged my hearing anyway.\n\nNext came the masks. Not your standard dust masks, but heavy-duty respirators that covered half our faces. Again, Ms. Vance cited safety concerns, something about airborne pathogens. It made communication on the floor nearly impossible, but we adapted.\n\nThe real changes began about two months after the takeover. I arrived for my shift one Monday morning to find the entire layout of the plant had been altered. Where before we'd had a straightforward progression from holding pens to kill floor to processing, now there were new sections, areas cordoned off with heavy plastic sheeting.\n\n\"What's all this?\" I asked Tommy, one of the younger guys who worked the stun gun.\n\nHe shrugged, eyes darting nervously. \"New processing areas, I guess. They brought in a bunch of new equipment over the weekend. Didn't you get the memo about the new procedures?\"\n\nI hadn't, but I soon found out. We were divided into teams now, each responsible for a specific part of the process. No one was allowed to move between sections without express permission from Ms. Vance or one of her assistants.\n\nMy team was assigned to what they called \"primary processing.\" It was familiar work – stunning, bleeding, initial butchery – but something felt off. The animals coming through seemed... different. Larger than normal, with strange proportions. When I mentioned it to Ms. Vance, she fixed me with a cold stare.\n\n\"Are you questioning the quality of our livestock, Michael?\" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" I replied, chastened. \"Just an observation.\"\n\nShe nodded curtly. \"Your job is to process, not observe. Is that clear?\"\n\nI muttered my assent and returned to work, but the unease lingered. As the days wore on, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was deeply wrong. The sounds that escaped my earplugs were different – not the normal lowing of cattle or squealing of pigs, but something else entirely. Something that raised the hair on the back of my neck.\n\nOne night, about a month into the new regime, I was working late. Most of the other workers had gone home, but I'd volunteered for overtime. Money was tight, and Nexus paid well for extra hours. I was just finishing up, hosing down my station, when I heard it.\n\nA scream. Human. Terrified.\n\nI froze, the hose slipping from my grip. It couldn't be. We were a slaughterhouse, yes, but we dealt in animals, not... I shook my head, trying to clear it. I must have imagined it, a trick of the mind after a long shift.\n\nBut then I heard it again. Muffled, distant, but unmistakable. A human voice, crying out in agony.\n\nMy heart pounding, I moved towards the sound. It was coming from one of the new sections, an area I'd never been allowed to enter. The plastic sheeting that separated it from the main floor was opaque, but I could see shadows moving behind it, backlit by harsh fluorescent light.\n\nI reached out, my hand trembling, and grasped the edge of the sheeting. Every instinct screamed at me to turn back, to forget what I'd heard and go home. But I couldn't. I had to know.\n\nSlowly, carefully, I peeled back the plastic and peered inside.\n\nWhat I saw in that moment would haunt me for the rest of my life. The room beyond was filled with stainless steel tables, each bearing a form that was horrifyingly familiar yet grotesquely wrong. They were human in shape, but twisted, mutated. Extra limbs sprouted from torsos, skin mottled with patches of fur or scales. And they were alive, writhing in restraints, their cries muffled by gags.\n\nStanding over one of the tables was Ms. Vance, her face obscured by a surgical mask. In her hand was a wicked-looking blade, poised to make an incision in the creature before her.\n\nI must have made a sound – a gasp, a whimper, I don't know – because suddenly her head snapped up, her eyes locking with mine. For a moment, we stared at each other, the truth of what I'd discovered hanging between us like a guillotine blade.\n\nThen she smiled, a cold, terrible smile that never reached her eyes.\n\n\"Ah, Michael,\" she said, her voice unnaturally calm. \"I was wondering when you'd find your way here. Come in, won't you? We have so much to discuss.\"\n\nI stumbled backward, my mind reeling. This couldn't be happening. It couldn't be real. But as I turned to flee, I found my path blocked by two massive figures in black uniforms. Security guards I'd never seen before, their eyes hidden behind dark glasses.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Ms. Vance's voice drifted from behind me. \"There's no need for alarm. You're one of our most valuable employees, Michael. It's time you learned the truth about Nexus Protein Solutions and the important work we do here.\"\n\nAs the guards gripped my arms, dragging me back towards that nightmarish room, I realized with horrible clarity that my life as I knew it was over. Whatever lay ahead, whatever sick truths I was about to learn, I knew I would never be the same.\n\nThe plastic sheeting fell back into place behind us, cutting off my last view of the familiar world I'd known. Ahead lay only darkness, the unknown, and the terrifying certainty that I was about to become part of something monstrous.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nThe guards forced me into a chair, their grip unnaturally strong. Ms. Vance circled me slowly, her heels clicking on the sterile floor. I tried to avoid looking at the tables, at the... things strapped to them, but their muffled cries pierced through my shock.\n\n\"I suppose you have questions,\" Ms. Vance said, her voice clinically detached. \"That's natural. What you're seeing challenges everything you thought you knew about the world.\"\n\nI found my voice, though it came out as a hoarse whisper. \"What are they?\"\n\nShe smiled, a cold expression that never reached her eyes. \"The future of food production, Michael. Humanity's answer to an ever-growing population and dwindling resources.\"\n\nMy stomach churned. \"You're... you're processing people?\"\n\n\"Not people, exactly,\" she corrected. \"Though they started as human, yes. We've made significant improvements. Faster growth, more efficient conversion of feed to meat, specialized organ development for luxury markets.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to deny the horror before me. \"This is insane. It's evil. You can't—\"\n\n\"Can't what?\" Ms. Vance interrupted sharply. \"Feed the hungry? Solve the looming food crisis? What we're doing here is necessary, Michael. Visionary, even.\"\n\nShe gestured to one of the writhing forms. \"Each of these specimens can produce ten times the usable meat of a cow, with half the feed. They reach maturity in months, not years. And the best part? They're renewable.\"\n\nMy eyes widened in horror as her meaning sank in. \"You're not just killing them. You're... harvesting them. Over and over.\"\n\nMs. Vance nodded, a hint of pride in her voice. \"Accelerated healing, enhanced regeneration. We can harvest up to 80% of their biomass and have them back to full size within weeks. It's a marvel of bioengineering.\"\n\nI felt bile rise in my throat. \"Why are you telling me this? Why not just... get rid of me?\"\n\nShe laughed, a sound devoid of warmth. \"Because you're observant, Michael. Dedicated. You've been here for over two decades, and you noticed things others missed. We need people like you.\"\n\n\"I'll never be a part of this,\" I spat. \"I'll go to the police, the media—\"\n\n\"And tell them what?\" she interrupted. \"That the local slaughterhouse is raising mutant humans for meat? Who would believe you? Besides,\" her voice lowered menacingly, \"we have resources you can't imagine. Ways of ensuring cooperation.\"\n\nShe nodded to one of the guards, who produced a syringe filled with an iridescent liquid. \"This is a choice, Michael. Join us willingly, and you'll be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. Refuse...\"\n\nThe guard grabbed my arm, needle poised above my skin.\n\n\"Wait!\" I shouted. \"I... I need time. To think.\"\n\nMs. Vance studied me for a moment, then nodded. \"Very well. You have until tomorrow night to decide. But remember, Michael – there's no going back now. One way or another, you're part of this.\"\n\nThe next day passed in a haze. I went through the motions of my job, my mind reeling. Every sound, every smell reminded me of what I'd seen. The other workers seemed oblivious, going about their tasks as if nothing had changed. Had they been bought off? Threatened? Or were they simply unaware of the horrors taking place beyond those plastic sheets?\n\nAs my shift neared its end, dread settled in my stomach like a lead weight. I knew I couldn't be part of this atrocity, but what choice did I have? If even half of what Ms. Vance said was true, Nexus had the power to destroy me – or worse.\n\nI was mulling over my impossible situation when I noticed something odd. A new worker, someone I'd never seen before, was wheeling a large covered cart towards one of the restricted areas. What caught my eye was a small symbol on his uniform – not the Nexus logo, but something else. A stylized eye within a triangle.\n\nThe man must have felt my gaze because he turned, his eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. He gave an almost imperceptible nod before disappearing behind the plastic sheeting.\n\nA wild hope flared in my chest. Could there be others who knew the truth? Who were working against Nexus from the inside?\n\nMy decision crystallized in that moment. I couldn't run, couldn't hide. But maybe, just maybe, I could fight back.\n\nWhen Ms. Vance summoned me that evening, I steeled myself for the performance of my life.\n\n\"I'm in,\" I told her, forcing conviction into my voice. \"You're right. This is... necessary. Visionary. I want to be part of it.\"\n\nShe studied me for a long moment, her gaze piercing. Then, slowly, she smiled. \"I knew you'd see reason, Michael. Welcome to the future.\"\n\nOver the next few weeks, I was introduced to the full scope of Nexus's operation. The horrors I'd initially witnessed were just the tip of the iceberg. There were entire floors dedicated to genetic manipulation, to behavioral conditioning, to processing the \"product\" into forms indistinguishable from conventional meat.\n\nI played my part, feigning enthusiasm, asking the right questions. All the while, I watched and waited, looking for any sign of the mysterious worker I'd seen. For any hint of resistance within Nexus's sterile walls.\n\nIt came, finally, in the form of a note slipped into my locker. Two words, written in a hasty scrawl: \"Loading dock. Midnight.\"\n\nAs the appointed hour approached, I made my way through the darkened facility, my heart pounding. I'd disabled the security cameras along my route – a trick I'd learned in my new role – but I still felt exposed, vulnerable.\n\nThe loading dock was shrouded in shadows, illuminated only by the dim glow of emergency lighting. For a moment, I thought I'd made a mistake, that I'd misunderstood or fallen into a trap.\n\nThen a figure emerged from behind a stack of pallets. It was the worker I'd seen, his face now uncovered. He was younger than I'd expected, with intense eyes that seemed to glow in the low light.\n\n\"You came,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Good. We don't have much time.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked. \"What's going on?\"\n\nHe glanced nervously over his shoulder. \"My name's Alex. I'm part of a group working to expose Nexus and shut down their operation. We've been trying to gather evidence, but it's been nearly impossible to get someone on the inside.\"\n\nHope surged within me. \"I can help. I've seen things, documented—\"\n\nAlex held up a hand, cutting me off. \"It's not that simple. Nexus has people everywhere – government, media, law enforcement. We need irrefutable proof, and a way to disseminate it that they can't block or discredit.\"\n\nHe pressed a small device into my hand. \"This is a secure communicator. Use it to contact us, but be careful. They're always watching.\"\n\nBefore I could ask more questions, Alex tensed, his eyes widening. \"Someone's coming. I have to go. Remember, trust no one.\"\n\nHe melted back into the shadows, leaving me alone with more questions than answers. As I hurried back to my station, my mind raced. I'd found allies, yes, but I was also in more danger than ever. One wrong move, one slip of the mask, and I'd end up on one of those tables, just another piece of \"product\" to be processed.\n\nThe next few days were a delicate balance of maintaining my cover while trying to gather information for Alex and his group. I smuggled out documents, took covert photos, and recorded conversations when I could. All the while, the horrors of what Nexus was doing weighed on me.\n\nIt wasn't just the genetic manipulation and the harvesting. I discovered entire wings dedicated to psychological experimentation, to breaking down and rebuilding human minds. I saw children – or what had once been children – being conditioned to accept their fate as little more than living meat factories.\n\nEach night, I'd return to my small apartment, fighting the urge to scrub my skin raw, to somehow wash away the taint of what I'd witnessed. The secure communicator Alex had given me remained silent, offering no guidance, no hope of rescue.\n\nThen, exactly one week after my midnight meeting with Alex, everything went to hell.\n\nI was in one of the processing areas, documenting a new \"batch\" of specimens, when alarms began blaring throughout the facility. Red lights flashed, and a computerized voice announced a security breach.\n\nFor a moment, I dared to hope. Had Alex and his group finally made their move?\n\nBut as armed security forces swarmed into the area, I realized with growing horror that this was something else entirely. They weren't heading for the restricted areas or the executive offices. They were converging on the main production floor – where the regular workers, oblivious to Nexus's true nature, were going about their normal shifts.\n\nI raced towards the commotion, my heart pounding. As I burst through a set of double doors, I was met with a scene of utter chaos. Workers were screaming, running in panic as security forces rounded them up with brutal efficiency.\n\nAnd overseeing it all, her face a mask of cold fury, was Ms. Vance.\n\nHer eyes locked onto me as I entered. \"Michael,\" she called out, her voice cutting through the din. \"So good of you to join us. We seem to have a bit of a... contamination issue.\"\n\nI froze, my blood running cold. Contamination. They were going to eliminate everyone who wasn't already part of their inner circle.\n\nAs security forces began herding workers towards the restricted areas – towards those horrible tables – I knew I had to act. But what could I do against an army of armed guards?\n\nMy hand brushed against the communicator in my pocket. It was a long shot, but it was all I had.\n\nAs Ms. Vance turned to bark orders at her security team, I pulled out the device and pressed what I hoped was a distress signal. Then, taking a deep breath, I stepped forward.\n\n\"Ms. Vance,\" I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. \"What's going on? How can I help?\"\n\nShe regarded me coldly. \"That remains to be seen, Michael. It seems we have a spy in our midst. Someone has been feeding information to some very bothersome people.\"\n\nMy heart raced, but I forced myself to remain calm. \"A spy? That's... that's impossible. Who would dare?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" she mused. \"Who would dare? Rest assured, we will find out. In the meantime, we're implementing Protocol Omega. Total reset.\"\n\nThe implications of her words hit me like a physical blow. They were going to \"process\" everyone, start over with a completely clean slate. Hundreds of innocent workers, people I'd known for years, were about to be turned into the very products they'd been unknowingly creating.\n\nI opened my mouth, though I had no idea what I was going to say. But before I could utter a word, a massive explosion rocked the building. The lights flickered and died, plunging us into darkness broken only by emergency lighting and the red glow of alarm beacons.\n\nIn the chaos that followed, I heard Ms. Vance shouting orders, her composure finally cracking. Security forces scrambled, torn between containing the workers and responding to this new threat.\n\nAnother explosion, closer this time. I was thrown to the ground, my ears ringing. Through the smoke and confusion, I saw figures moving with purpose – not Nexus security, but others, faces obscured by gas masks.\n\nA hand gripped my arm, hauling me to my feet. I found myself face to face with Alex, his eyes visible behind his mask.\n\n\"Time to go,\" he shouted over the din. \"Your distress call worked, but this place is coming down. We need to get as many people out as we can.\"\n\nAs we ran through the smoke-filled corridors, helping dazed workers find their way to emergency exits, I realized that this wasn't an ending. It was a beginning. Nexus was bigger than this one facility, their tendrils reaching far and wide. What we'd done here tonight was strike the first blow in what would be a long, difficult battle.\n\nBut as I emerged into the cool night air, gulping in breaths free from the stench of death and chemicals, I felt something I hadn't experienced in a long time: hope. Whatever came next, whatever horrors still lay ahead, I was no longer alone in the fight.\n\nThe war against Nexus had begun, and I was ready to see it through to the bitter end.​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nThe months following the destruction of the Nexus facility were a whirlwind of activity. Alex's group, which I learned was called the Prometheus Alliance, had cells all over the country. They'd been working for years to uncover and expose Nexus's operations, but our breakthrough had accelerated their plans.\n\nI found myself at the center of it all. My years of experience in the industry, combined with the insider knowledge I'd gained, made me an invaluable asset. We worked tirelessly, following leads, gathering evidence, and planning our next moves.\n\nIt wasn't easy. Nexus's influence ran deep, and for every facility we exposed, two more seemed to pop up. We faced constant danger – assassination attempts, smear campaigns, and worse. I lost count of the times we narrowly escaped capture or death.\n\nBut we were making progress. Slowly but surely, we were chipping away at Nexus's empire. Independent journalists began picking up our leaks, and public awareness grew. Protests erupted outside Nexus-owned businesses. Governments launched investigations.\n\nThe turning point came almost a year after our escape. We'd managed to trace Nexus's operations to its source – a massive underground complex hidden beneath an innocuous office building in downtown Chicago. This was their nerve center, where the top executives and lead scientists oversaw the entire operation.\n\nOur assault on the complex was the culmination of months of planning. We had allies in law enforcement, in the media, even in government. When we struck, we struck hard and fast.\n\nI'll never forget the moment we breached the main laboratory. It was like stepping into a nightmare made real – rows upon rows of tanks filled with grotesque human-animal hybrids in various stages of development. Scientists in hazmat suits scurried about, desperately trying to destroy evidence.\n\nAnd there, in the center of it all, was Ms. Vance. She stood calmly amidst the chaos, a slight smile on her face as she watched us enter.\n\n\"Ah, Michael,\" she said, her voice as cold and composed as ever. \"I must admit, I underestimated you. Well played.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, before any of us could move, she pressed a button on a device in her hand. Alarms blared, and a computerized voice announced the initiation of a self-destruct sequence.\n\n\"You may have won this battle,\" Ms. Vance said as security doors began to slam shut around us, \"but Nexus is bigger than this facility, bigger than you can imagine. We will rise again.\"\n\nIn the frantic minutes that followed, we managed to override the self-destruct sequence and secure the facility. Ms. Vance and several other top Nexus executives were taken into custody. More importantly, we were able to save hundreds of victims – both the fully human prisoners and the genetically modified beings who still retained enough of their humanity to be saved.\n\nThe data we recovered from the complex was damning. It provided irrefutable proof of Nexus's crimes, implicating government officials, business leaders, and others who had enabled their operation. The resulting scandal rocked the world.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, Nexus's empire crumbled. Facilities were shut down across the globe. Arrests were made at all levels of the organization. The full scope of their atrocities was laid bare for the world to see.\n\nBut our work was far from over. The victims – those who could be saved – needed extensive rehabilitation. The genetically modified beings posed ethical and logistical challenges unlike anything the world had seen before. And there were still Nexus loyalists out there, working to rebuild from the shadows.\n\nFive years have passed since that night in Chicago. I'm no longer the man I was when I first stumbled upon Nexus's secrets. The horrors I've witnessed have left their mark, but so too has the good we've managed to do.\n\nThe Prometheus Alliance has transitioned from a shadowy resistance group to a recognized humanitarian organization. We work to rehabilitate Nexus victims, to advocate for stricter regulations on genetic research, and to remain vigilant against any resurgence of Nexus or similar groups.\n\nAs for me, I find myself in an unexpected role – a spokesman, an advocate, a link between the victims and a world still struggling to understand the magnitude of what happened. It's not an easy job, but it's important work.\n\nSometimes, in quiet moments, I think back to my days at the slaughterhouse. How simple things seemed then, how naive I was. I remember the day Nexus took over, the slow descent into horror that followed. Part of me wishes I could go back, could warn my younger self of what was to come.\n\nBut then I think of the lives we've saved, the evil we've stopped, and I know I wouldn't change a thing. The world knows the truth now. We're no longer fighting in the shadows.\n\nThere are still hard days, still battles to be fought. Nexus may be gone, but the temptation to abuse science, to treat human life as a commodity – that will always exist. But now, at least, we're ready. We're watching. And we'll never let something like Nexus rise again.\n\nAs I stand here today, looking out at a room full of survivors – human and hybrid alike – preparing to share their stories with the world, I feel something I hadn't felt in years: pride. We've come so far, overcome so much. And while the scars may never fully heal, we face the future with hope, determination, and the unshakable knowledge that, together, we can overcome even the darkest of evils.\n\nThe nightmare of Nexus is over. A new day has dawned. And we'll be here, standing guard, for whatever comes next."},"501":{"title":"I found an astronaut floating in space","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fejnmw\/i_found_an_astronaut_floating_in_space\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Wooleyty","selftext":"I was halfway through another routine scan when the proximity alarm jolted me out of my daze. It wasn’t loud, just a soft beeping, but on a station as quiet as this one, even the smallest sound felt like a shout. I blinked at the screen, trying to make sense of the blip that had suddenly appeared.\n\nThere, floating just outside the station's perimeter, was a body. I sat up straight, eyes wide. At first, I thought it was debris—space junk drifting too close to the station—but then I saw it: a spacesuit. A person. They were close enough that I could see the reflection of the station's lights on their visor, their body eerily still in the void.\n\nMy fingers moved automatically over the controls. I activated the external cameras, zooming in on the figure. The suit bore the insignia of a ship, though I didn’t recognize it. No signs of movement, no attempt to signal. Just floating.\n\nA thousand thoughts rushed through my head. How did they get here? How long had they been drifting? My mind raced, but protocol kicked in. I sent out a retrieval drone, watching as its mechanical arms reached out and gently latched onto the astronaut’s suit. Slowly, it pulled them toward the airlock.\n\nI ran down the corridor, my heart pounding in my chest, unsure what to expect when I opened the hatch. Was this person even alive? As the inner airlock cycled, I saw the body slump forward slightly. The visor of the helmet was dark, and for a second, I felt a chill crawl up my spine.\n\nThe door hissed open, and I pulled the astronaut inside. I fumbled with the helmet, my hands trembling as I twisted it off. The face beneath was pale, almost ghostly, but alive. Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused at first, then locking onto mine with an intensity that made me step back.\n\n“I… I thought I was alone,” she whispered, her voice cracked and raw, like she hadn’t spoken in days.\n\nI stared at her, unable to speak for a moment. She was alive. Barely. But alive.\n\nI guided her carefully to the health bay, supporting her as she stumbled down the corridor. Her limbs were weak, her movements sluggish, but she followed, muttering incoherent words under her breath. I wasn’t sure if she was delirious from exhaustion or if something else had happened to her out there, in the dark.\n\nThe health bay wasn’t much—just a sterile white room with basic medical equipment—but it was enough for an emergency. I helped her onto the examination table, my hands still shaking a bit from the adrenaline of the moment. She collapsed onto the surface, her breathing shallow but steady.\n\nI stood there for a moment, staring at her. Who was she? How had she ended up drifting so close to the station, alone? I moved to the terminal and began running the basic diagnostics, letting the machine take over for a while as I collected my thoughts.\n\nHer suit was ancient, worn and patched in places. That insignia on her chest—I couldn’t place it, but something about it felt… off. The records on this station didn’t list any nearby ships. No one had passed through this region of space for months, maybe years. She shouldn’t have been here.\n\nI glanced over at her again. Her eyes were closed now, her chest rising and falling slowly. She looked peaceful, in a way, but there was something underneath that calm exterior. Something haunted. I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever her story was, it wasn’t a good one.\n\nI sat down at the console, pulling up the station’s database. I had to know who she was, where she came from. Maybe she had been lost in some sort of freak accident—a ship malfunction or something else. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t that simple. People didn’t just show up out of nowhere, floating alone in space.\n\nAs the machine scanned her vitals, I found myself wondering. What had she seen out there? What had happened to her crew? And more importantly, why was she the only one left?\n\nWith the astronaut finally resting in the health bay, I couldn’t just sit still. My mind was racing with questions, each one more unsettling than the last. Who was she? Where had she come from? And why had she been left behind, drifting in space?\n\nThe insignia on her suit was my only lead. It was worn, barely legible, but there was enough of it left to make out some details. A faded logo, a series of numbers and letters. I pulled up the station's database, typing in the fragments I had pieced together. As the search churned through the archives, I glanced back at the health bay monitor. She was still asleep, her vitals steady but weak.\n\nThe screen flickered as the search results came in. At first, nothing seemed relevant—just a bunch of old mission logs and defunct ship IDs. But then, something caught my eye. A name. I scrolled back, heart thudding in my chest as I read the details.\n\nThe ship she had come from wasn’t just any vessel—it was part of an old mission, one I hadn’t heard of in years. The *Horizon-7*. A crew of scientists and engineers sent on a deep-space exploration decades ago. Their mission had been classified, highly secretive, and somewhere along the way, they had vanished. No one knew what had happened to them. They were presumed lost, swallowed by the blackness of space.\n\nI stared at the screen, disbelief creeping over me. The *Horizon-7* had been missing for over thirty years. There were whispers about what they had been sent to find—rumors of alien contact, an encounter with something beyond our understanding—but nothing had ever been confirmed. And now, one of its crew was here, on my station, after all this time.\n\nThe implications rattled me. If she had been part of that mission, how had she survived out there for so long? And what had happened to the rest of the crew?\n\nI turned away from the screen, glancing back at the sleeping astronaut. She looked frail, vulnerable, but there was something else, too. Something that sent a chill down my spine. She had answers, I knew that much. And I wasn’t sure if I was ready to hear them.\n\nI couldn’t just sit there waiting for her to wake up. The silence felt heavier with each passing hour. I kept checking the health bay’s monitors, watching her vitals. Everything seemed normal, stable, but she wasn’t waking up. Something about this felt wrong, like the calm before a storm.\n\nI needed answers. I activated the communications console, my fingers hovering over the keys. I hesitated for a moment, unsure how HQ would take the news. The *Horizon-7*—a decades-old mission that had been buried in history. I knew how corporations worked. They didn’t like surprises, especially ones that didn’t fit into their plans.\n\nStill, I had no choice. I transmitted my message.\n\n\"This is Station Epsilon. We’ve recovered a lone astronaut in proximity to the station. Suit identification matches the *Horizon-7* crew, presumed lost thirty years ago. Awaiting further instructions.\"\n\nI sat back and waited, the delay between transmissions long enough for my nerves to tighten. I glanced at the sleeping astronaut. Her face was expressionless, her body too still. I didn’t like it.\n\nThe console blinked—HQ’s response was quicker than I expected.\n\n\"Station Epsilon, this is HQ. You are to secure the individual and ensure no unauthorized communication takes place. Do not discuss this with other personnel. We will send further instructions. Continue regular monitoring.\"\n\nMy stomach tightened. That was it? No questions, no shock, no confusion—just cold, detached orders. I stared at the message, rereading it, trying to shake off the sinking feeling. They weren’t interested in figuring this out. They just wanted it contained.\n\nI replied, keeping my tone neutral. \"Understood. I’ve stabilized her, but she remains unconscious. Should I expect a recovery team?\"\n\nA longer pause this time. When their message finally came back, it was clipped, more direct than before.\n\n\"Do not engage further. No recovery team is needed. Continue routine operations. Any further information should be transmitted via encrypted channels only.\"\n\nThey were shutting me down. A cover-up, plain as day. They didn’t want a recovery team. They wanted this to disappear, just like the *Horizon-7* had thirty years ago.\n\nI glanced at her again, lying still in the health bay, her breathing shallow but steady. HQ didn’t care about what happened to her or her crew. They cared about control. And I knew, in that moment, whatever story she had to tell—it was something they wanted buried.\n\nI couldn’t just sit there waiting for her to wake up. The silence felt heavier with each passing hour. I kept checking the health bay’s monitors, watching her vitals. Everything seemed normal, stable, but she wasn’t waking up. Something about this felt wrong, like the calm before a storm.\n\nI needed answers. I activated the communications console, my fingers hovering over the keys.

HQ didn’t care about what happened to her or her crew. They cared about control. And I knew, in that moment, whatever story she had to tell—it was something they wanted buried.\n\nThe hours crawled by, and she still didn’t wake. Her vitals remained stable, but something about the situation felt off. It wasn’t just the fact that she’d been floating out there for who knows how long. It was the silence—the stillness. I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever had brought her here wasn’t finished yet.\n\nI couldn’t wait anymore. I needed to report this to HQ. My hands moved over the console, sending out a carefully worded message.\n\n\"This is Station Epsilon. I’ve retrieved a lone astronaut from proximity to the station. Her suit is marked with the insignia of the *Horizon-7* mission, presumed lost three decades ago. She is unconscious but stable. Requesting further instructions.\"\n\nI sat back, expecting the usual protocol to kick in. Normally, they’d ask for a detailed report, maybe suggest a routine quarantine or medical evaluation. But something told me this wouldn’t be routine.\n\nA response came faster than I anticipated.\n\n\"Station Epsilon, this is HQ. A recovery team is en route to your location. Isolate the individual immediately and ensure she remains secured until they arrive. Do not allow any interaction with the rest of the crew. Further instructions will follow.\"\n\nI blinked at the screen, reading the message again to make sure I hadn’t misread it. A recovery team? Isolation? That wasn’t normal. Usually, we’d handle cases like this in-house—quarantine procedures, medical checks, and a full evaluation before sending anyone back. But this… this was different. They were treating her like a threat.\n\nProtocol should have been straightforward: monitor her condition, report any changes, and await clearance. But sending a recovery team, especially so quickly, didn’t make sense. Not unless there was something about this situation they already knew. Something they weren’t telling me.\n\nI hesitated before replying, unsure how much to push back.\n\n\"Understood. She remains unconscious. No signs of immediate danger. Will isolate as instructed.\"\n\nI stared at the console for a long moment after sending the message, my mind racing. What was so important about this astronaut that they’d break protocol? Why were they so insistent on isolation, on keeping her away from the rest of us?\n\nI glanced back at her through the small window to the health bay. She looked harmless enough, just a woman who had been lost for far too long. But HQ’s urgency told me there was more to this—something I wasn’t seeing yet.\n\nAnd whatever it was, it was big enough to send a team out here to contain it.\n\nI hadn’t slept. I sat at the console, staring at the health bay monitor, waiting for something to change. Every minute felt like an eternity. The message from HQ kept running through my mind—recovery team, isolation, no contact. It didn’t sit right with me, but I followed orders. I had to.\n\nThat was, until she woke up.\n\nIt happened suddenly. One minute, the monitor showed her vitals steady, her body still, and the next—her eyes snapped open, wide and panicked. She gasped like she couldn’t breathe, her body convulsing as if she were still out there, floating in the vacuum of space. I watched as she thrashed on the bed, her arms flailing against the restraints I had set up to keep her from injuring herself.\n\nMy hand hovered over the console. HQ’s orders were clear: isolate her, no interaction. I was supposed to wait for the recovery team to handle this. But the sight of her—so confused, so terrified—it was too much.\n\nI couldn’t just watch her suffer like this.\n\nI switched on the intercom, my voice shaking as I spoke. \"Hey—hey, you’re okay. You’re safe. You’re on a space station now. You’re not floating anymore.\"\n\nShe didn’t stop thrashing, her head turning wildly from side to side, her eyes unfocused, wild. Her breathing came in shallow, ragged gasps. I tried again, keeping my tone calm, steady.\n\n\"You’re safe. You were drifting near our station. We pulled you in. You’re not out there anymore.\"\n\nHer movements slowed, her eyes blinking rapidly as if she was trying to process the words. She stared up at the ceiling, still breathing heavily, but at least she’d stopped fighting.\n\n\"Where... where am I?\" she rasped, her voice hoarse, barely above a whisper. \"I don’t—what happened?\"\n\n\"You’re on Station Epsilon,\" I explained through the intercom, relieved that she was responding. \"I found you outside, drifting near the station. You’ve been unconscious for a while, but you’re stable now. A recovery team is on the way.\"\n\nShe groaned, her head lolling to the side as if the information was too much to take in. \"Station Epsilon... I don’t... I was... I was with my crew. What happened to my crew?\"\n\nHer confusion hit me like a punch to the gut. The files said her ship had been lost for decades, but here she was, asking about her crew like it had just happened. I hesitated, unsure of how much to tell her, unsure of what would push her further into panic.\n\n\"I’m not sure yet,\" I said, my voice softer now. \"You were the only one we found. Do you remember anything before we picked you up?\"\n\nShe stared blankly at the ceiling for a long moment, and I could see the fear creeping back into her eyes. \"There was... something. I don’t... I can’t remember. They were—\" Her voice cracked, and she shook her head violently, like she was trying to shake loose a memory she didn’t want. \"Where is everyone? Why am I alone?\"\n\nI leaned in closer to the intercom, feeling the weight of her desperation pressing against me. \"I don’t know yet, but you’re safe now. Try to rest, okay? The recovery team will help you.\"\n\nBut even as I said the words, I could feel the unease gnawing at me. She wasn’t just confused—she was terrified. And whatever had happened to her out there, whatever had left her floating alone in space, was something she was still trying to escape.\n\nI couldn’t stop myself. I had to know. Orders be damned, there was something more here, something she wasn’t saying. The confusion in her voice, the fear—it gnawed at me. I leaned closer to the intercom, taking a deep breath before speaking again.\n\n\"What happened to you?\" I asked softly, my voice barely audible over the hum of the station. \"What happened out there? Where’s your crew?\"\n\nShe looked up at the ceiling, her eyes distant, like she was staring past it into something far darker. Her mouth opened, but no words came out at first. I thought she might drift back into unconsciousness, but then, her voice cracked through the silence.\n\n\"We were on a mission,\" she said, her voice still raspy, like it hurt to speak. \"A planet, far from here. We were sent to investigate possible signs of life. And we found it.\"\n\nI leaned in closer, hanging on every word.\n\n\"It wasn’t what we expected. No eyes, no mouth. Just... a rock. It looked like a rock. Felt like one, too. Cold, hard, rough. It was about the size of a bowling ball—just sat there, lifeless. But we knew it was alive. We were so excited. We brought it on board, ran some tests. Its skin, if you could call it that, was thick, like stone, but it pulsed—just barely. We didn’t know what to make of it, but it was alive. We were sure of it. It was the proof we needed.\"\n\nHer voice trailed off for a moment, and I felt the weight of where this was heading settle in my chest.\n\n\"We set a course back to Earth,\" she continued. \"Everyone was celebrating. We thought we’d made history. We were wrong. I remember the quarantine officer—he was in charge of monitoring the life form while we kept it contained. It was protocol, but... then he came running into the mess hall. He was out of breath, eyes wide, like he’d seen something... something awful. He said it was gone. The life form—it escaped quarantine.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, the tightness in my chest growing. \"What do you mean ‘escaped’? Where did it go?\"\n\nShe shook her head, her face pale. \"We didn’t know. We searched the whole ship. It wasn’t big—there weren’t that many places for it to hide. But we couldn’t find anything. No traces, no signs it had moved. It was just... gone.\"\n\nHer voice dropped to a whisper as she continued. \"That’s when we realized something was wrong. The quarantine officer wasn’t with us anymore. He wasn’t searching the ship with the rest of us. We... we started looking for him, calling his name, but he didn’t answer.\"\n\nHer breathing grew shaky. \"We found him in the restroom. He was on the floor, making these horrible sounds, these... wet, disgusting noises. We thought he was sick, but when we flipped him over—\" She stopped, her hands trembling. \"His face... it was melting. His skin was... sliding off, like it wasn’t attached to anything. And there were these... things, sharp things, poking out of his shoulders, his stomach. Blood everywhere.\"\n\nI could feel my own pulse quicken as she spoke.\n\n\"We rushed him to the med bay, isolated him, but there was nothing we could do. We rotated shifts, keeping an eye on him. I was third in line. By the time I got there... it was worse. So much worse. The spikes had grown. They were... longer, sharper, and his face—it was like his whole skull was sagging, like there was nothing left underneath holding it together.\"\n\nI couldn’t look away from her, my heart pounding in my chest. \"And then?\"\n\n\"He was... getting paler, but his vitals...\" She shook her head, her voice trembling. \"His vitals were normal. He should’ve been dying, but he wasn’t. He was alive. Somehow, he was still alive.\"\n\nShe stopped talking, her breath ragged, her body trembling.\n\nShe paused for a long time after describing the man’s condition, her breathing shallow as if reliving the memory all over again. I waited, holding my breath, knowing there was more. And whatever she was about to say—it was going to be worse. Much worse.\n\n\"I... I fell asleep,\" she whispered, her voice breaking slightly. \"I was supposed to be watching him, but I couldn’t keep my eyes open. The exhaustion—it was too much. I don’t know how long I was out. Could’ve been minutes, could’ve been hours.\"\n\nHer eyes glazed over, distant. \"When I woke up, there was this... banging. At first, I thought it was something wrong with the ship. I was disoriented, but then I saw it. The quarantine window—it was rattling, shaking with each hit. And he was the one doing it.\"\n\nShe swallowed hard, her hands shaking as she continued. \"But it wasn’t him anymore. Not really. His face... God, his face was just... hanging there. It wasn’t even attached properly. It was like his skin had turned into a bag, just sagging over his skull, loose and wrinkled. And those spikes—the ones that had been poking out of his shoulders and stomach—they were... moving. Like they had a mind of their own.\"\n\nShe stared at the ceiling, her voice trembling. \"He was trying to say something, banging on the glass, but all that came out was this horrible, wet sound, like his throat had been ripped apart. I could see it in his eyes, though. He was still in there—trapped inside whatever that thing was. I could see him trying to fight, to ask for help.\"\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach, but I didn’t interrupt. She had to get this out.\n\n\"Before he could say anything,\" she continued, her voice cracking, \"two more spikes—no, not spikes, appendages—burst out of his stomach, right there in front of me. The sound... I’ll never forget that sound. Like bones snapping, flesh tearing. Whatever was inside him, it was taking over. Completely.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath, her eyes flicking around the room as if she expected the creature to appear any second. \"It wasn’t human anymore. The spikes had grown into limbs—arms, legs, moving independently. It was... walking. Walking around the room, like it was searching for a way out. The spikes on its shoulders—those were its arms now. And the ones from its stomach... they were its legs. So many legs.\"\n\nHer voice dropped to a whisper. \"It looked like... like a twisted, messed-up insect, but bigger. Bigger than any human. Its head was full of black eyes, too many eyes. And its mouth—God, its mouth—there were all these tiny appendages, wriggling, pulling bits of whatever it found closer to its mouth. Like it was trying to feed.\"\n\nI could barely breathe as she described it, the image forming in my mind more horrible than anything I could’ve imagined.\n\n\"But he was still alive,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"I could hear him groaning—these low, horrible sounds, like he was in pain. The thing had split him in two. His bottom half, his legs, they were connected to its stomach, dangling there. And his top half... it was stuck to its back. Like a sick, twisted puppet.\"\n\nShe shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. \"I could see him fighting, his arms, his legs trying to move, trying to break free. But he couldn’t. He was trapped inside it, and there was nothing he could do.\"\n\nShe stopped, staring blankly ahead, her whole body trembling. The room was deathly quiet. I wanted to say something, anything to break the silence, but there were no words. What could I possibly say to that?\n\nShe took a long, shaky breath, her eyes unfocused, as if she were seeing the horrors again in her mind. I could feel my pulse quickening with every word, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted her to continue, but I had to know.\n\n\"It was feeding on him,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible. \"The creature—it was... eating him. Bit by bit, his legs—\" Her voice caught in her throat, her hands gripping the edges of the bed so tightly her knuckles turned white. \"I could see it tearing off pieces of his legs, chewing through them slowly, like it was savoring every bite. And he—he tried to scream, but nothing came out. Just this... horrible, wet sound. His mouth moved, but the pain—God, the pain was too much. He couldn’t get the scream out.\"\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, her breath coming in quick, shallow gasps. \"I didn’t know what to do. I just... stood there, frozen. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. I just watched.\"\n\nShe paused, her whole body trembling, and when she spoke again, her voice was shaky. \"Then, all of a sudden, I snapped out of it. I couldn’t stay there anymore. I ran. I ran as fast as I could.\"\n\nI watched her, feeling my stomach knot tighter with each word.\n\n\"I could hear it behind me,\" she continued, her eyes wide and wild. \"It was slamming into the door. Hard. I could hear the metal bending, cracking, like it was about to give way. It was going to break out—I knew it was. It was so close. I didn’t look back. I just ran. I didn’t care where, I just had to get away.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath, her hands trembling as she spoke. \"I made it to the corridor, and that’s when I saw the others. They had heard the noise—they were coming to check on me. I tried to tell them what I saw, but my words were all over the place. I couldn’t make sense of it myself. Then we heard it. The sound. It was crawling. It was coming down the corridor, right behind me.\"\n\nHer voice cracked, and she closed her eyes. \"We turned and ran. We locked ourselves in the mess hall, but then... we realized someone was missing. One of the crew. We heard him screaming.\"\n\nI felt my heart drop as she continued. \"He was pounding on the door, begging us to let him in. We didn’t know if we should open it—what if the thing was right behind him? But we couldn’t leave him out there.\"\n\nHer voice trembled as she relived the moment. \"We opened the door just a little, enough for him to squeeze through. He barely made it, collapsing onto the floor. He was holding his stomach, groaning in pain, but the creature... it didn’t follow him. It just... stopped.\"\n\nShe paused, her eyes wide with fear. \"We gathered around him, asking what happened, but he couldn’t talk. He just kept holding his stomach. I remember someone turning him over, trying to help him, but when they did—\"\n\nHer voice dropped to a whisper, her face pale. \"We saw it. This... huge, sharp appendage sticking out of his stomach. He was grasping it, trying to pull it out. But the moment we turned him over, he lost his grip. The thing—it wriggled, like it was alive, and pushed itself deeper into his stomach. We could hear the bones cracking, the flesh tearing. His scream... his scream was like nothing I’ve ever heard before.\"\n\nShe looked down, tears welling up in her eyes. \"We all backed away, terrified. No one knew what to do. We just watched as the thing kept moving inside him, like it was burrowing deeper.\"\n\nShe stopped, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The room felt colder now, the air thick with the weight of her story. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t think. All I could do was sit there, horrified by the nightmare she had lived through.\n\nHer voice had grown softer, more distant, as if the weight of her memories was pulling her back into that nightmare. I could see the fear in her eyes, and I didn’t push her. Not yet. I waited as she gathered herself, but I could sense something terrible was coming.\n\n\"We were in the kitchen,\" she started again, her voice trembling. \"The captain and I. It was just the two of us left. We knew there was nothing we could do for the others. They were already gone—taken by whatever that thing was. We knew we couldn’t stop it. We were trying to come up with a plan. The captain... he wanted to go back to Earth. He thought that if we could just get back, HQ would know what to do. They could help.\"\n\nHer face twisted with regret. \"I told him it was a terrible idea. That thing—it was still on the ship. We couldn’t bring it to Earth. We argued. I told him we had to destroy the ship, but he wouldn’t listen. He said it was too late. We had no other options.\"\n\nShe stopped, shaking her head. \"Eventually, he agreed to think of something else. He told me there was a breach on the outside layer of the ship—something messing with the communications. He told me I needed to do a spacewalk to inspect it.\"\n\nHer eyes flicked up to meet mine, full of regret. \"I didn’t want to go. I had a bad feeling, but... he insisted. He got aggressive, pushing me to do it. So I did. I suited up, hooked into my tether, and went out.\"\n\nHer voice grew cold. \"The moment I was outside, I felt it. The jolt. The tether—it snapped. No, it didn’t snap. He released it. He left me floating, watching the ship get smaller and smaller as it drifted away. He abandoned me, left me to die out there while he took the ship back to Earth.\"\n\nThe betrayal in her voice was raw, and I could feel my own stomach twist at the thought of it.\n\nSuddenly, the console blinked, breaking the silence between us. HQ was trying to contact me. I turned to the console, my hands trembling as I opened the channel.\n\n\"Station Epsilon, this is HQ. Great news! The lost ship from the *Horizon-7* mission has just arrived back on Earth!\" The voice on the other end was disturbingly cheerful. \"We’ll be making contact with the crew after a 24-hour quarantine, but we’ve been having trouble establishing communication inside. Nothing to worry about, though. We’ll investigate after quarantine ends.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold. They had no idea what they were dealing with.\n\nI turned back toward the health bay, my heart pounding. \"You have to listen to me,\" I said into the comms, urgency creeping into my voice. \"You can’t let anyone near that ship. The crew—\"\n\nBut before I could finish, I heard a voice behind me. \"Help,\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\n\nI turned, just in time to see her body convulse violently. Her back arched off the bed, her hands clawing at the air as her mouth opened in a silent scream. For a split second, I saw the terror in her eyes, the desperation as she reached out toward me.\n\nAnd then, with a sickening crack, her chest exploded.\n\nThe sound was deafening—bone snapping, flesh tearing apart as something burst from inside her. Blood sprayed across the window in a thick, dark sheet, obscuring her body for a moment. I could hear her ribs cracking, splitting apart under the force of whatever was tearing through her.\n\nWhen the blood finally cleared, I saw it.\n\nA creature—grotesque, twisted—emerged from the gory wreckage of her torso. Its limbs were long and jagged, sharp appendages that looked almost insect-like, slick with her blood. The first two appendages to appear were spiked, writhing as they pushed their way out of her chest cavity. But the most horrifying part wasn’t the creature itself—it was that she wasn’t dead.\n\nHer body was torn in half, her legs still attached to the lower part of the creature. Her torso, what was left of it, was connected to its back, hanging there like some sick puppet. Her arms twitched, her hands still grasping at nothing, while her head lolled to one side, her eyes wide and unfocused, her mouth moving in silent agony.\n\nThe creature wasn’t just bursting out of her—it was using her.\n\nHer lower half had been split open, and the creature's slick, spindly legs were wrapped around her waist, digging into the flesh where her hips used to be. The jagged appendages moved with terrifying precision, lifting her body as if it were part of its own anatomy. Her legs, now useless, twitched as the creature began to crawl forward.\n\nBut it was her face—her face that sent a chill through my entire body. Her skin sagged, like there was no more structure underneath. The connective tissue was gone, and her face drooped, the muscles barely holding together. And the spikes that had burst from her shoulders—now they were moving, independently, like grotesque limbs growing out of her.\n\nSuddenly, the creature’s head emerged from the gory mass of her torso. It was bulbous, with too many eyes—black, glistening, soulless eyes. Its mouth opened, revealing rows of tiny appendages, wriggling, pulling bits of her flesh closer to its mouth.

I really tried my best with it and I don't know what I else I can do. It use to be such a happy dog and it was the light of my life, but now it is always sad. I don't want to re-home it but having a depressed dog isn't what I signed up for. I signed up for having the only good times with my dog but now it is always sad. The way it walks and growls, it has no energy anymore to being a fun dog. It loved my two sons and wife as well. \n\nI even started loving the dog more than my own family and so I wanted to give the dog more. I wanted to show it appreciation for being such a good happy dog. So I turned my oldest son into a 2 bed house. I can make houses put of anything, and when I took my dog into the house that use to be my eldest son, the dog was whimpering. I was a bit angry at the dog for not showing me appreciation for what I had done for him. I had to force it to walk around the house. \n\nThe dog perked up when i tool him home and he saw my second eldest son. I was a bit annoyed at the dog. The 2 bed house that use to be my son, you can hear it whimper sometimes and crying. Then when I turned my second eldest child into a e bed house, I was sure that the dog would appreciate it. When it entered the 3 bed house that use to be my son, you could hear him crying through the walls. My dog didn't seem to pleased with it. I forced my dog to walk around the house. \n\nMy wife was angry at me for turning our 2 sons into a house. I was more annoyed at the dog. The dog preferred my wife now and when I turned my wife into a 4 bed house, I knew the dog would be upset. I wanted to upset it. I told the dog to get over it and the dog was whimpering the same as my wife who is a house now. The dog has been depressed for months now and it doesn't seem to do much anymore. \n\nI am going to re-home it and get another happy dog. I will miss that dog for the way it use to be.

It was truly mystifying to us that someone would want us to be loud all the times. I mean usually people would rather have silence all the time, and being too loud gets you in trouble in my experience. It wasn't just one of the neighbours but the whole street was demanding that I be loud all the time. I mean I know a few guys who wouldn't mind being loud all of the times, but I'm sure even they have limits. I was getting letters through my posts about having to be loud. \n\nWe then started to get knocks on our door from neighbours and they were telling us to be loud. They were telling us that we are too silent and that they don't like silent people. I was taken aback by all of this and I told them that there is nothing wrong with being silent. It's good to have silence in a neighbourhood, and being too loud will contribute to noise pollution. I started to get angry and loud with some of my neighbours nagging me to be loud, they only smiled at me and said \"that's the spirit do more of that\" \n\nSo we decided to be loud and we were playing loud music and just in general being a nuisance. The neighbours seemed happy about this and we tried keeping this up. Then as we were playing loud music for as long as we could, the neighbours started to complain that we weren't being loud enough. This was just absurd and we were being as loud as we possibly could with all this music. The neighbours looked more pissed and they were demanding that we become the loudest on the street. \n\nI couldn't take it anymore and I swore at them. I don't care if they didn't think that I wasn't loud enough and it's my life. Then people started to demand that we be more louder and they started cutting themselves. They said if I don't up my game in being loud, then they would do more things to themselves. I tried upping the level at being loud and it did stop them at hurting themselves for a temporary amount of time. Being loud majority of the times is actually hard work. I wondered why they wanted me to be loud?\n\nThey started doing more strange things like posting their xray images of the insides of their own bodies into my house. It was strange that their X-rays didn't look human at all. They are now decapitating themselves because I am not being loud enough.

Ghost stories, urban legends, all that stuff, none of it had ever held much sway over me. But after my first night as a security guard at this 24-hour gas station on the outskirts of town, I wasn’t so sure anymore.\n\nIt was supposed to be an easy gig. A late-night job to pay the bills. Nothing more than keeping an eye on the place, handling the occasional drunk driver or rowdy teen, and making sure no one wandered too far into the parking lot. At least, that’s what I thought when I applied. The pay was decent, the hours quiet, and the isolation didn’t bother me. In fact, I preferred it.\n\nThe gas station itself wasn’t much to look at, a dingy building that sat at the edge of a long, winding road that seemed to stretch into nothing. The main attraction was the bright fluorescent lights that flickered above the pumps and cast long shadows across the parking lot. Inside, it was just as unimpressive: aisles of chips and snacks, a small refrigerator stocked with energy drinks and sodas, and a counter where my coworker, Ray, sat behind the register.\n\nRay was in his late forties, maybe early fifties, and had the look of a man who’d spent too many years on the night shift. His skin was pale, his hair thinning, and his eyes had that glazed-over, distant look that made me wonder if he ever really slept. He’d been at the gas station for years, or so he told me on my first night, and he didn’t say much else unless he had to.\n\nTonight, as I clocked in and grabbed my flashlight, Ray was sitting behind the counter, sipping from a cup of coffee and staring out into the parking lot. He nodded at me when I came in but didn’t say anything at first. He didn’t need to.\n\n“How’s the night been so far?” I asked, trying to make some small talk.\n\nRay took a long sip of his coffee before answering, his voice gravelly from too many cigarettes. “Quiet. Just how I like it.”\n\n“Anything I should know about?” I asked, settling in for what I thought would be an uneventful night.\n\nRay’s eyes flicked toward me, then back to the parking lot. “Yeah, actually,” he said slowly. “There are a few things you should know. Rules, mostly. The kind that’ll keep you out of trouble.”\n\nI raised an eyebrow. “Rules? Like what?”\n\nRay glanced over his shoulder, as if making sure no one else was listening, then leaned in a bit closer. “I’ll tell you about them through the night,” he said. “It’s easier that way. Some things you just need to experience to understand.”\n\nI was about to ask him what he meant when he added, “And one more thing: don’t ask too many questions.”\n\nThe night passed slowly. The hours seemed to drag on, and apart from the occasional car pulling in to fill up, nothing much happened. I made my rounds around the parking lot, checked the perimeter, and kept an eye on the pumps. Ray stayed behind the counter, always watching, always sipping his coffee.\n\nIt wasn’t until around 1 AM when Ray suddenly cleared his throat. “There’s something you need to know about,” he said, his voice low and serious. “First rule.”\n\nI stopped mid-step and turned toward him. “Yeah?”\n\n“If you see a little boy come in,” Ray continued, “around seven or eight years old, wearing a red jacket, don’t talk to him. Don’t even acknowledge him. Just let him do what he does and leave. He comes around sometimes, usually late at night. But whatever you do, don’t speak to him. If he asks you for help, ignore him.”\n\nI stared at Ray, waiting for the punchline, but there wasn’t one. He was dead serious.\n\n“What happens if I talk to him?” I asked.\n\nRay didn’t look at me. “You don’t want to know,” he muttered.\n\nI didn’t press him further, but the thought of a little boy wandering around the gas station in the middle of the night was unsettling enough.\n\nA few hours later, after another lull in activity, Ray spoke up again. “Second rule,” he said, without looking at me.\n\nI was restocking the drinks in the cooler, and I stopped, listening.\n\n“Stay out of the shadows,” Ray continued. “If the lights flicker and go out, stay where it’s lit. Don’t walk into the dark corners. You might see things moving in the dark, shadows that don’t belong to anything. Whatever you do, don’t follow them. They’ll lead you somewhere you can’t come back from.”\n\nI glanced out the window at the flickering parking lot lights. They were old, barely working half the time. But Ray’s tone made me uneasy.\n\n“Have you seen the shadows?” I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.\n\nRay shrugged, sipping his coffee. “Once or twice. Don’t care to see ‘em again.”\n\nAround 3 AM, the gas station was completely silent. No customers, no cars, just the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. I was getting restless when Ray spoke up again.\n\n“Third rule,” he said. “That door in the back of the station? The one marked ‘Employees Only’? Don’t open it. Don’t knock on it, don’t go near it. Just ignore it. It’s better that way.”\n\nI frowned, looking toward the back of the station. There was a door there, old and scratched up, with a faded sign that read “Employees Only.” I hadn’t paid much attention to it before.\n\n“What’s behind it?” I asked, though I had a feeling I already knew Ray’s answer.\n\n“Don’t know. Don’t care to find out,” Ray replied. “But sometimes you’ll hear noises coming from back there. Scratching, tapping, maybe even voices. Ignore it. The door stays closed.”\n\nI swallowed hard, feeling the weight of his words settle over me.\n\nThe hours dragged on. It was nearing 4 AM, and fatigue was starting to set in. The hum of the gas station’s lights, the soft hum of the refrigerator units, and Ray’s occasional cryptic advice were all that kept me company.\n\nThat’s when Ray hit me with the fourth rule.\n\n“Last thing you need to know for now,” he said, his voice just above a whisper. “The light in the parking lot? The big one near the pumps? Make sure it stays on. If it goes out, you need to fix it right away.”\n\nI raised an eyebrow. “What happens if it goes out?”\n\nRay set his coffee cup down and gave me a hard look. “If it goes out, they’ll come. And you don’t want them coming.”\n\nI didn’t ask who they were.\n\nSometime after 4 AM, the gas station felt… wrong. I was stocking shelves when I noticed Ray wasn’t behind the counter anymore. I hadn’t seen him leave or heard him move. It was as if he had vanished.\n\n“Ray?” I called out, stepping toward the counter. No answer.\n\nI looked around the gas station, checking the aisles, the bathrooms, and even the perimeter outside. But there was no sign of him. The back door remained shut, the shadows in the far corners of the station dark and foreboding.\n\nI felt a rising sense of dread. Ray was nowhere to be found. The air felt thick, like it was pressing down on me, and a chill crept up my spine.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered one of the rules, the shadows. I stayed under the fluorescent lights, avoiding the dark corners, my heart racing. I didn’t know if I’d broken a rule by looking for him, but something told me I had.\n\nThe parking lot light flickered.\n\nMy stomach lurched, and I sprinted outside, fumbling with the switch on the side of the building. After a few agonizing seconds, the light sputtered back to life. The parking lot bathed in that familiar glow, and I exhaled, my hands shaking.\n\nWhen I went back inside, Ray was there. Sitting behind the counter like he’d never left.\n\n“Where the hell did you go?” I demanded, my voice louder than I’d intended. “I couldn’t find you anywhere.”\n\nRay didn’t look up from his coffee. “You shouldn’t have looked for me.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That’s the last rule,” he said, his voice low and tired. “If I disappear, don’t look for me. The thing that comes back won’t be me. Don’t talk to it, don’t acknowledge it, just pretend it’s not there.”\n\nI stared at him, my blood running cold. “What the hell are you talking about?”\n\nRay finally looked up at me, his eyes empty, devoid of any emotion. “You broke the rule.”\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest, confusion and fear swirling inside me. Was he messing with me? How could this thing be telling me not to talk to it if it wasn’t Ray?\n\nI backed away slowly, my mind racing. If this wasn’t Ray, then what was it? Why would it warn me about itself?\n\nThe shadows in the corners of the station seemed to shift, growing darker, stretching toward me. The parking lot light flickered again, and this time, I didn’t move. I was frozen, caught between disbelief and terror.\n\nIt was like the shadows were alive, moving, slithering, coiling closer and closer. My mind raced, screaming at me to stay in the light, to follow Ray’s rules. But my legs felt like lead, my body unwilling to respond as the darkness seemed to wrap itself around the corners of the store.\n\nSuddenly, a low hum filled the air, like the station itself was groaning under the weight of something unseen. The flickering of the parking lot light became more erratic, casting brief, harsh flashes across the interior. In the back of my mind, I remembered what Ray had said about the lights: If they go out, they’ll come. You don’t want them coming.\n\nI swallowed hard, forcing myself to move. My body jerked into action as I ran for the switch that controlled the parking lot lights. My fingers fumbled with the old, rusted lever on the wall, and for a moment, my heart nearly stopped as I realized it wasn’t working. The hum intensified, and the shadows seemed to surge forward, creeping across the floor like liquid night.\n\nWith a desperate grunt, I yanked the switch harder. The parking lot light sputtered back to life, bright and glaring, chasing the shadows back into the corners.\n\nI collapsed against the wall, panting, my heart hammering against my ribcage. The light was on, and the shadows had retreated. But the station didn’t feel any safer. I could still feel them, watching, waiting for the light to fail again. I didn’t want to admit it, but part of me wondered if the light was the only thing holding them back.\n\nAnd then there was Ray, or whatever was pretending to be him, sitting behind the counter, sipping his coffee as if nothing had happened. The weight of his final rule sat heavily on my mind.\n\nThe thing that comes back won’t be me. Don’t talk to it. Don’t acknowledge it.\n\nWas this really happening? Had I broken the rule, or had Ray, or the thing wearing his skin, lied to me? My hands trembled as I stood there, staring at him. It felt like a twisted game. He had returned, informed me of a rule that might not even apply anymore, and then gone back to his coffee like none of it mattered.\n\nI took a few shaky steps forward, and that’s when the next event happened.\n\nA soft chime echoed through the gas station. The door had opened. I hadn’t seen it move, there hadn’t been a car pulling up to the pumps, but when I turned around, I saw him.\n\nThe boy.\n\nHe couldn’t have been more than seven or eight years old, just like Ray had described. His red jacket stood out in the dim fluorescent glow of the station, too bright, too vivid for the otherwise washed-out world of the night. He stood by the door, looking around as if lost, his eyes wide and pleading.\n\nEvery instinct screamed at me to help him. It didn’t feel right, just standing there, pretending he wasn’t there, pretending I didn’t hear the quiet sniffle of a child trying to hold back tears. But Ray’s warning burned in the back of my mind: If you see a boy in a red jacket, don’t talk to him. Don’t acknowledge him.\n\nThe boy took a few tentative steps into the store, his small hands fidgeting with the zipper of his jacket. He was looking right at me.\n\n“Mister?” His voice was soft, barely above a whisper. “Can you help me? I… I can’t find my mom.”\n\nMy throat tightened. I glanced at Ray, or whatever was pretending to be him. He hadn’t moved, hadn’t reacted at all to the boy’s presence. It was like he couldn’t even see him.\n\nThe boy took another step closer. “Please… I’m scared.”\n\nI clenched my fists, forcing myself to follow the rule. My pulse raced, my mind fighting between the human instinct to help a child and the primal fear that told me something was deeply wrong. The temperature in the station seemed to drop, the fluorescent lights buzzing ominously overhead. My hands trembled as I focused on keeping still.\n\nThe boy sniffled again. “Why won’t you help me?” His voice was louder now, almost accusatory. “Please…”\n\nTears welled in his wide eyes, and he reached out toward me.\n\nThat’s when I saw it, the flicker, the momentary slip. His face didn’t change at first, but in the dim light, I saw his eyes flash, just for a second, with something that wasn’t human. Something cold and hollow. The smile that had started to creep across his lips was wrong, too wide, too sharp.\n\nI took a step back, my breath catching in my throat. The boy let out a soft whimper, his face contorting with mock sadness.\n\n“Why won’t you help me?”\n\nHis voice had changed. It wasn’t the voice of a child anymore, there was something deeper, something older beneath it. The words echoed, bouncing off the walls of the station.\n\nI turned away, refusing to look at him, ignoring the chill that crept down my spine as his footsteps echoed softly across the floor. The sound of his movement grew quieter until, finally, the door chimed again. He was gone.\n\nI leaned against the counter, my nerves frayed, my mind racing. Ray, or the thing that looked like Ray, sat there watching me. He didn’t say anything about the boy, just sipped his coffee, his eyes distant and glazed.\n\nI glanced toward the back of the store, where the “Employees Only” door loomed like a dark shadow at the end of the hallway. I hadn’t noticed it before tonight, but now, it felt like the focal point of everything wrong in this place.\n\nThe faintest sound reached my ears, a soft scratching, barely audible over the hum of the station’s lights.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat.\n\nRay had warned me about the door. Don’t open it. Don’t knock. Don’t go near it.\n\nBut the sound continued, persistent and unsettling. It wasn’t just scratching anymore, there was a faint tapping, like knuckles against wood. A soft, rhythmic knock.\n\nMy feet felt glued to the floor. I couldn’t move, couldn’t even look away from the door. The knocking grew louder, more insistent, and my breath caught in my throat.\n\nI wasn’t supposed to go near it.\n\nBut something was there. Something was behind that door, and every second that passed felt like it was pulling me toward it.\n\nSuddenly, the knocking stopped. Silence hung in the air, thick and oppressive.\n\nI exhaled, the tension in my chest easing just slightly. But then, the door creaked.\n\nIt wasn’t much, just the faintest movement, as if someone had leaned against it from the other side. The knob didn’t turn, the door didn’t open. But it moved.\n\nA voice, quiet and low, drifted through the door.\n\n“Let me out…”\n\nI stumbled backward, my heart pounding in my chest. The voice was faint, muffled, but it was unmistakable. Someone, something, was behind that door.\n\nRay’s warning echoed in my mind: The door stays closed.\n\nI turned back toward the front of the store, but Ray, if that was even still him, hadn’t moved. He stared ahead blankly, as if oblivious to the sounds, oblivious to me.\n\nThe door creaked again, and the voice grew louder.\n\n“Please… let me out…”\n\nMy legs moved on instinct. I bolted for the front of the station, my mind screaming at me to get away from that door, to get as far from it as I could.\n\nI made my way to the front door, taking in gulps of the cold night air as soon as I stepped outside. The parking lot lights flickered above me, but this time, I wasn’t going to leave them unchecked. I couldn’t afford another close call with the shadows. I couldn’t afford anything else.\n\nI stayed close to the lights, my body trembling with exhaustion and fear, my mind swirling with questions. Who, or what was behind that door? What had happened to Ray, and was the thing behind the counter really him? And why had the boy looked at me like that, with those cold, hollow eyes?\n\nThe sky began to lighten just slightly. Dawn wasn’t far off. I just had to make it through the night.\n\nBut as I stood there, keeping my eyes on the station’s entrance, something else started to feel wrong.\n\nThe fluorescent lights inside the store flickered, just for a second, but long enough for me to see it. Ray wasn’t sitting behind the counter anymore. The chair was empty.\n\nA cold sweat broke out across my forehead as I scanned the parking lot. There was no sign of him, no sign of anyone. I turned back toward the store, trying to make sense of it all.\n\nAnd then the door creaked open behind me.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, I turned around.\n\nRay, or something that looked like him, stood in the doorway, staring at me with a blank expression. His eyes were glassy, distant, his skin pale. He didn’t move, didn’t speak.\n\nI froze, remembering the last rule he’d given me. Don’t talk to it. Don’t acknowledge it.\n\nMy mouth went dry. This wasn’t Ray. It couldn’t be. But if it wasn’t, then what was it doing there? And why had it come back?\n\nIt took a step toward me, and I backed away, keeping my eyes on the figure.\n\nIt wasn’t him. It couldn’t be him.\n\nThe sun’s first rays finally broke over the horizon, the pale light spilling into the parking lot. I kept my distance, edging toward my car, refusing to take my eyes off the figure standing in the gas station’s doorway.\n\nThe night was over. I had made it through.\n\nBut as I drove away, leaving the gas station behind, the feeling of unease stayed with me. I couldn’t shake the thought: if that thing wasn’t Ray, why did it tell me the rules?\n\nAnd more importantly, what else was it hiding from me?\n\nThat was my last night at the gas station.\n\nAnd I don’t plan on ever going back."},"510":{"title":"The Sign","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fec2bc\/the_sign\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\n\n\nThe night was an impenetrable wall of darkness, no moon, no stars, as if the sky had been swallowed by the void. I had been driving along the deserted road for hours, the only company the soft hum of the engine and the yellow glow of the headlights slicing through the black. The silence around me grew thicker with each mile, and the feeling of being completely alone in a world forgotten by time began to weigh on me. Suddenly, the car jerked, coughed, and the engine died with a guttural sound. I pulled over, cursing my luck.\n\nI stepped out of the car, and the silence swallowed me whole. The night felt alive, pulsing with a stillness that made my ears ring. Of course, my phone had no signal. I popped the hood, even though I didn’t know much about cars, and that’s when the smell hit me. A sharp, rotten stench filled the air, like something decaying nearby. My stomach turned, and I covered my nose with my sleeve, trying not to breathe too deeply.\n\nThat’s when I heard it.\n\nA low, menacing growl coming from the shadows of the forest by the roadside. My heart pounded in my chest. I turned slowly, my headlights illuminating only the empty asphalt and the menacing outline of the trees. But then, I saw them. Eyes — two glowing yellow orbs staring at me from the undergrowth, far off but clearly locked onto me.\n\nIt was a werewolf.\n\nA hulking figure, covered in black fur as dark as the night, with claws glinting in the faint light. The foul smell intensified, as if the very air had been tainted by the beast’s presence. Without thinking, I ran. My legs burned, but the terror pushed me forward. The growl grew louder, followed by the heavy thuds of paws on the ground, like a predator ready to strike.\n\nI ran blindly, but in the distance, I saw something — a fence, a rusty metal gate, with a sign illuminated by the weak beams of my headlights. Hope surged inside me, desperate, as I neared the gate. But when I got close enough to read the sign, I froze. The words on the sign chilled my blood:\n\nNO ENTRY\nDANGER\nANGRY COW\nANGRY DOG\nKILLER BUFFALO\nELECTRIC FENCE\nCRAZY EMPLOYEE\n\nMy mind was racing. What the hell was this place? Was it a refuge or just another nightmare? I glanced back, the werewolf was closer now, its growl almost vibrating through the air. There was no choice. I pushed the gate open and stepped inside.\n\nThe land was vast and dark, surrounded by thick trees. Tall grass brushed against my legs as I tried to get further away from the entrance. The sign had promised danger, but none of it seemed as deadly as what was outside. Or so I hoped.\n\nSuddenly, something moved to my right. A loud stomping noise hit my ears, and my heart nearly stopped. From the middle of the overgrown grass, a massive cow appeared, eyes bloodshot and foam dripping from its mouth. It stared at me with a wild, animalistic fury. Before I could react, I heard more hoofbeats behind me. A gigantic buffalo, with threatening horns, emerged from the shadows, its gaze locked on me.\n\n“Shit!” I muttered, feeling trapped. What the hell was this place? I was fleeing from one nightmare straight into another. My instinct was to run, but where to? The fence was far behind me, the furred beast was outside, and now I was stuck with a raging cow and a buffalo that looked ready to crush me without a second thought.\n\nAs I tried to figure out where to go, I heard something, a muffled sound, almost like laughter — a laugh that didn’t sound human. I didn’t know if I was starting to lose my mind or if the \"crazy employee\" from the sign was real. The situation felt more hopeless by the second. I started running again, trying to dodge the animals, but the feeling of being watched was growing stronger.\n\nFinally, I spotted a small, old building in the middle of the land, a sort of shed. With no other choice, I sprinted toward it, praying the walls would be enough to keep out the horrors outside.\n\nWhen I got close to the door, it creaked open. Inside, a dim light flickered, and in the middle of the room, a man in dirty clothes and disheveled hair was staring at me with a twisted grin. His eyes were wild, and he was holding a shovel, his hands stained with dirt and blood.\n\n“You’ve come to the wrong place, buddy,” the man rasped, his voice hoarse, “but don’t worry. You’ll be safe here... from some things.”\n\nThe werewolf's growl echoed from somewhere outside, mixed with the sounds of the restless animals. The man’s laugh grew louder, as if he was getting some kind of sick amusement from the situation. I was trapped between the insane man, the werewolf lurking outside, and the furious animals roaming the land.\n\nNot knowing who or what to trust, I shut the door, my hands trembling. Maybe, just maybe, I had a chance — a chance to survive a night that seemed straight out of my worst nightmares.\n\nBut that stench of rot filled the air again.\n\nAnd this time, I wasn’t sure if it was coming from outside... or inside.\n\n"},"511":{"title":"Any creepypastas about Animatronics or something similar?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1feg7e2\/any_creepypastas_about_animatronics_or_something\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"LionFalse4295","selftext":"I've been wanting to look for more creepypastas about robots or animatronics, but there seems to be a lack of them.

The image of her body—mutilated, twisted, and forever locked in that grotesque grin—was burned into his mind. His nightmares were filled with blood-soaked walls and the message Jeff the Killer had left for him:\n\n*Go to sleep.*\n\nEmily had just been one of Jeff’s many victims, but for Harris, it was personal. Her death had shaped his entire career, pushing him deeper into a world of violence and death. Jeff had vanished without a trace after that, leaving behind nothing but a trail of bodies and fear.\n\t\nNow, after all these years, Harris felt it again. That same cold dread. The killings had started once again.  \n  \n“Mark, you’re not going to believe this,” Officer Daniels said, stepping into the hallway. His voice was lower than usual, like he didn’t want to disturb something sacred—or something dangerous.\n\t\nHarris didn’t respond immediately, just nodded and pushed through the door into Sarah Greene’s bedroom. The air hit him like a wall. Stale, thick, and rotten, the kind of air that sticks to your skin. But it wasn’t the smell that made his stomach churn.\n\n“Jesus Christ,” Harris whispered, eyes locked onto the scene before him.\n\nSarah’s body lay crumpled on the floor, limbs bent at impossible angles. Her skin was pale, her eyes wide and unblinking, but that wasn’t what caught Harris’s attention. Her mouth—ripped into a grotesque smile—had been carved wide open, so deep that the skin around her lips had begun to tear. It was as if someone had taken joy in destroying her face.\n\nDaniels stood beside him, fidgeting, his voice tight. “Same as before, right? That… that smile.”\n\nHarris said nothing. He couldn’t. His gaze drifted up to the wall, where the words were scrawled in crimson, dripping down the plaster:\n\n*Go to sleep.*\n\nIt was like stepping back in time, back to Emily’s room, back to that night.\n\n*“Fuck,”* Harris muttered, barely able to keep his hands from shaking. “He’s back.”\n\nDaniels shifted nervously. “But why her? She’s just a kid. What the hell did she ever do to deserve… this?”\n\nHarris stared at Sarah’s body, then at the blood-soaked wall. “He doesn’t need a reason,” he said, his voice flat. “Not one that makes sense.”\n\n“Yeah, but…” Daniels hesitated. “It feels different this time, doesn’t it? Like he’s—”\n\n“Like he’s making it personal,” Harris finished, mind already racing as it traced through the possibilities. His fingers twitched as he lifted Sarah’s blood-soaked hair away from her face, the cuts on her cheeks sharp, almost surgical. Deliberate. Too precise for someone in a frenzy.\n\n“This isn’t just about killing,” Harris said quietly, almost to himself. “This is a message.”\n\nDaniels furrowed his brow. “What kind of message?”\n\nHarris straightened up, wiping his hands on his pants. “One for me.”\n\n“Mark…” Daniel’s voice wavered. “You think he’s doing this for you?”\n\nHarris’s jaw tightened. “I know it.”\n\nDaniels stood there, lost for words, until he finally managed, “Why now? It’s been what—ten years?”\n\n“Doesn’t matter,” Harris said, staring at the message again. “Time doesn’t mean shit to a monster like Jeff. He was always playing the long game.”\n\nDaniels looked uneasy. “So what now?”\n\n“We find out why he chose her.” Harris’s eyes flickered down to Sarah’s face one last time. “And we find him before he chooses someone else.”\n\nThe drive back to his apartment was quiet, too quiet. Harris’s hands gripped the steering wheel so tight his knuckles were white, the image of Sarah Greene’s body flashing in his mind over and over again. The grin. The cuts. The *blood*. It was all too familiar, too personal.\n\nHe parked outside his building, but didn’t get out. Instead, he stared at the dashboard, his mind lost in memories he’d buried long ago. His sister Emily—her face locked in that same, cruel smile—floated to the surface.\n\nHarris’s phone buzzed, and a sharp, sudden jolt pulled him back to reality. He glanced down at the screen:\n\n*Blocked number.*\n\nHe knew it wasn’t a telemarketer. His gut told him to answer, but his fingers froze just before they hit the screen. Not yet, not now. With a frustrated sigh, he stepped out of the car and into the night, the cool air doing little to soothe the unease creeping up his spine. He walked into his apartment, flicking on the lights and heading straight to the kitchen. Harris didn’t bother with the whiskey tonight; there was no numbing the feeling.\n\nFiles were spread across the kitchen table, open and scattered in a chaotic mess. Pictures of Emily. Crime scene reports. Even the old newspaper clippings from when Jeff the Killer had first appeared. His sister’s smiling face stared up at him from one of the photos, so different from how he remembered her in the end. \n\nHarris sat down, staring at the mess before him. “Why now, Jeff?” he muttered to himself. “Why the hell now?”\n\nHis phone buzzed again.\n\n*Blocked number.*\n\nHarris grabbed the phone, staring at it for a few seconds longer than he should have. Finally, he answered.\n\n“...Who is this?”\n\nThere was silence on the other end. Then, a voice, low and raspy.\n\t\n“Mark… It’s been a while.”\n\nHarris’s blood turned to ice. That voice—it was unmistakable. \n\n“Jeff.”\n\nA dark chuckle echoed through the receiver, slow and deliberate. “Miss me?”\n\nHarris’s jaw clenched. “Where the fuck are you?”\n\n\"Closer than you think.” The line went dead.\n\nFor a moment, Harris just stood there, the phone still pressed to his ear. His mind raced in sync with his pulse. This wasn’t a random return. \n\nJeff the Killer was back for a reason.\n\nThe garage was suffocating. The scent of gasoline mingled with something far worse—blood, decay, and violence. Harris ducked under the police tape, his footsteps heavy as he approached the dangling body of Tom Hargrove. The man hung from the rafters like a puppet, his arms and legs twisted into impossible shapes, his face carved into the same smile that haunted Harris.\n\n“Fuck me,” Daniels whispered behind him. “It’s him, isn’t it?”\n\nHarris didn’t answer, his eyes locked on the blood pooling beneath Hargrove’s feet. The words scrawled across the floor in deep red were unmistakable:\n\n*Did you miss me?*\n\n“Yeah,” Harris finally answered in a low voice, “It’s him.”\n\nHe crouched down, examining the letters more closely. They were uneven, almost rushed, as if Jeff had been in a hurry this time. That was unusual. Jeff had always enjoyed taking his time.\n\n“You notice something off?” Harris asked, looking over at Daniels.\n\nDaniels looked confused. “Off? Besides the guy hanging like a fucking marionette?”\n\n“These cuts,” Harris pointed to the jagged edges on Hargrave’s face. “They’re messy. Jeff’s kills weren’t messy. He was methodical.”\n\nHarris stood, his hands on his hips as he scanned the scene. “It means he’s in a hurry. Means he’s after something—or someone—specific.”\n\nDaniels shifted. “You think this is all leading somewhere, don’t you?”\n\n“You’d be a fool not to.” Harris’s voice was firm. He didn’t want to say it out loud, but the pieces were starting to fall into place. Tom Hargrove wasn’t just another random kill. He’d worked at the garage where Harris’s father had taken their car when they were kids. Harris had been there. Emily had been there.\n\nHe knew Sarah Greene and Tom Hargrove wouldn’t be the last.\n\nHarris sat in his office, the dim light casting long shadows across the room as he stared at the mess of case files strewn about his desk. His fingers trembled as he flipped through the photographs, police reports, and witness statements. Each piece felt like a fragment of something much bigger—something he hadn’t fully grasped yet, but the shape of it was starting to form, and it was *ugly.*\n\nHe rubbed his face, exhaustion creeping in. He hadn’t wanted to admit it, but the connections emerging were undeniable. Sarah Greene. Tom Hargrove. Neither of them were just victims plucked out of random chance. They were tied to his life, his past. To Emily. Jeff wasn’t just killing for the thrill—he was drawing Harris in, targeting those who had touched his life in some way.\n\nHarris’s mind kept circling back to Sarah’s name. Greene. Her aunt had been in Emily’s class. He hadn’t thought much of it at first—it seemed like a small, almost coincidental detail—but now, it gnawed at him, Why would Jeff target Sarah? Why start with her?\n\nHe jumped as his phone buzzed. \n\n*Blocked number.*\n\nHarris glared at it, pulse pounding. It was Jeff. He knew it was the bastard. The calls had been coming in at random hours for the last few days. Every time, Harris hesitated to pick it up.\n\nNot this time.\n\nSnatching up the phone, he answered and said, “What the fuck do you want?” Rage burned inside Harris.\n\nFor a moment, there was nothing but silence from the other end, followed by a soft, familiar chuckle. “You know, Mark… you were always too slow. Too slow to save her. Too slow to stop me.”\n\t\nHarris’s grip tightened around the phone, knuckles white. “Be a man, Jeff. Tell me where you are, you bastard.”\n\nAnother laugh, this one darker. “I’m right where I need to be.”\n\nThe line went dead. Harris slammed the phone down on the desk, white hot anger bubbling just below the surface. Jeff was playing with him. Taunting him. And now it was becoming clear—these murders weren’t just about the victims. They were about Harris. About making him suffer all over again.\n\nBut why now? Why come back after all these years?\n\nHarris flipped open Tom Hargrove’s file, his eyes scanning the familiar details. Tom had been a mechanic, someone Harris’s family had known for years. Harris’s father used to take the car to his shop when they were kids. Emily had been there with him once or twice, watching as Tom and his dad chatted about repairs.\n\nHis stomach twisted. He thought those nightmares were buried deep, forgotten, but now Jeff was pulling them out—turning them into weapons. The phone buzzed again, Harris blocking out the incessant vibrating until it stopped. He had to think, to piece together the fragments before Jeff could pull the rug out from under him again. Tom wasn’t just another name on Jeff’s list—he was part of Harris’s life. Just like Sarah.\n\t\nRealization slammed into Harris like a train. Jeff wasn’t just killing indiscriminately—he was recreating the worst moments of Harris’s life, one body at a time.\n\nAnd he knew it wasn’t over yet. \n\nThe room was a horror show. Jessica’s body had been torn apart, her intestines pulled from her stomach and strewn across the living room floor like decorations. Her fingers had been broken backward, the nails cracked and bloody from clawing at the walls in a desperate attempt to escape. Her mouth, like the others, was carved into that horrible smile, stretching so wide it looked like her face would split in two.\n\nBlood soaked the carpet, splattered across the furniture in dark, arterial sprays. The message—Go to sleep—scrawled on the wall above her head in thick, wet letters, almost as though the killer had written it slowly, enjoying every second.\n\n“Jesus,” Daniels whispered, his voice barely audible as they surveyed the scene.\n\nHarris stood at the center of the room, eyes locked on Jessica’s mutilated body. Heart slamming in his chest, he took a step closer, his boots squelching in the soaked carpet. Every bit of him screamed at him to walk away, to turn his back on this nightmare. But he couldn’t.\n\nHis eyes flicked over the body, scanning for details—clues that might tell him why Jeff had chosen her. Then, it clicked. Jessica’s father had been the contractor hired to renovate Harris’s childhood home after Emily’s murder. Another connection. Another victim tied to his past.\n\n“This isn’t random,” Harris said under his breath.\n\n“What?” Daniels turned, brow furrowed.\n\n“All of them. Sarah Greene. Tom Hargrove. And now Jessica Miller.” Harris’s voice was low, but the conviction was unmistakable. “They’re not random victims. They’re all connected to me. To Emily.”\n\nDaniels blinked, trying to process what Harris was saying. “You think… you think this is about you?”\n\n“I know it is,” Harris said, his voice tight. He ran a hand through his hair, mind racing. “Jeff is dragging me back into this, piece by piece. He’s tearing apart my past, killing everyone who was connected to it.”\n\n“Jesus, Mark.” Daniels took a step back, his face pale. “But why now? After all these years?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Harris admitted, his voice cracking under the weight of the realization. “But I’m gonna find out.”\n\nHarris sat in his car outside the crime scene, the rain tapping softly against the windshield. His hands gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles, the weight of the situation finally settling in. Jeff wasn’t killing only for the thrill. Every victim was carefully chosen—all connected to his past. The next victim wouldn’t just be another person from his past.\n\nThe next victim would be much closer.\n\nHis phone buzzed, the glow from the screen cutting through the darkness.\n\n*Blocked number.*\n\nWith trembling hands, Harris answered the call.\n\n“You’re finally paying attention,” Jeff’s voice rasped through the phone, low and menacing.\n\nHarris simmered for what felt like eternity, the suppressed rage boiling away the thin thread of patience and will he had remaining. His face grew hot.\n\n“Where are you goddamnit?” Flecks of spit flew from Harris’s mouth as he lost all control, slamming a clenched fist hard enough against the driver side window that it shattered around his arm. Searing pain flooded through his arm, only fueling the absolute hate for the monster softly chuckling into his ear. \n\n“You fucking coward! If you want me so bad, come get me. I’m still at the crime scene of the last poor girl you fucking ripped apart. Come on!”\n\nNo answer. Only the soft patter of rain and the distant rumble of thunder filled the silence that seemed to stretch forever.\n\nThen, a soft chuckle.\n\n“Oh Mark, where’s the thrill in that?” Jeff said wryly. “This was just the prelude. I hope you’re ready for the main performance.”\n\nThe line clicked, only the soft patter of rain and the distant rumble of thunder left to fill Harris’s storming thoughts."},"514":{"title":"The Silent Watchers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fed4uc\/the_silent_watchers\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"CreepyStoriesJR","selftext":"I thought I lived an ordinary life, a decent job, a quiet apartment, and a steady routine.

A drop point deep in the Appalachians, a dark and sombre cave of slate and moss. It was here I read my latest orders.\n \nThe paper in my hand felt heavier than it should have. It detailed sightings of a Lycan terrorizing a secluded community deep in the Appalachian wilderness. Missing livestock, strange howls in the night, and a growing sense of dread among the locals. Typical signs, yet always unique in their own chilling way.\n\nCypher, they call me. With a name like mine, it’s of no surprise that I found myself recruited by The Order. In my short career I have undergone countless trials, received many scars, and had close calls with creatures most people only whisper about in hushed tones. My last hunt had nearly been my end—a Wendigo in the Smokey Mountains Resort and Spa. It took me a month to recover from the physical wounds, longer still for the mental ones. But now, I was ready. Or so I told myself.\n\nI took a deep breath, folding the paper and slipping it into my jacket pocket. The damp smell of moss and the slow sound of dripping of water on slate broke my reverie. “It’s time to get to work”. My voice echoed off the slate, a little louder than I intended, the noise causing a shiver to run up my spine.\n\nWith that, I shouldered my pack, picked up my rifle from its spot leaning against the hollowed out log, where I found my orders and turned on heel. My footsteps echoed off the cold floor of the Grotto as I made my way, with measured footsteps to the moonlit aperture leading outside. The night air was crisp, filled with the scent of pine and the promise of danger. Another hunt awaited, another battle in the shadows. And I, Cypher, would face it head-on.\n \nMy heart pumped in my ears as my well-worn boots broke ground down the darkened forest trail. It had taken me a full month to recover from the wendigo, and I had yet to return to full fitness. Honestly, I probably should not have been given this Hunt. The Order however, was low on choices in the Appalachians at the moment, as incursions in more populated areas close to the cities were becoming more common place. This is why I had been contacted despite my lack of full recovery. We had no one else.\n \nSlowing my pace as I rounded the bend that led to a small clearing, I stopped to take a knee. Unshouldering my gear, I took a moment to take inventory. Why haven’t I done that already you may ask? I had. The simple reasoning behind the check, was that you could never check too much. Preparedness was drilled into you during the Orders’ training, and before that, the marines. I had my rifle, silver bullets dipped in Wolfsbane, my combat knife and my bandoleer of preventatives. The silver, despite common belief won’t actually kill the Lycan outright, but should slow it and weaken it enough for the combat knife. There are very few things, in my experience at least, that can continue to draw breathe with a knife lodged in their heart, followed by a quick application of the Orders’ fire solution. Such creatures exist, don’t get me wrong, it’s just that they require teams to bring down, not just one Hunter.\n \nA blast of cold wind followed by a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder, gave an ominous back drop to the foreboding clearing. Reaching into my bandoleer, I pulled out a small vial of brackish grey liquid. A wound regenerating preventative. Although my muscle mass had not yet recovered from the wendigo hunt, I couldn’t take the risk against a foe such as this. Unscrewing the metal cap, my nose was assaulted by the foul smelling liquid. Steeling myself for the taste, I downed it in one quick motion, feeling the preventative take effect almost immediately.\n \nNow all I had to do was wait. If the information given to me by the Watchers was accurate, which it had yet to be an issue, this clearing marked the edge of the Lycans last known route into the small logging town 3 miles east. Taking another deep breath I closed my eyes, not willing to rely on them in the current weather conditions. The lightning was playing tricks with my eyes, each strike illuminating the clearing and casting foreboding shadows at the corner of my vison.\n \nStraining my ears against the creaking pine trees, I listened. Nerves on a razors edge. It didn’t take too long before the slight rustle of leaves and crack of twigs under a heavy footfall, let me know that I wasn’t alone. The clearing was only fifty feet across and a little less in length. The sound carried easily enough in the cold conditions. Opening my eyes but not turning my head, as doing so would give away that I had noticed, I glanced out of the corner of my eyes to the right hand side of the clearing. Huddled at the edge of sight, a dark mass punctuated by eyes that glowed like hot coals, regarded me with predatory intention.\n \nMy heart raced, and it took an effort of will to slow it down. The Lycan had spotted me. At this distance it would be a tough shot to make, considering I would have to aim first, which means I would have to move and further draw the beasts attention. As I considered my options, another snap of twigs came from the left side of the clearing, the sound drawing the Lycans swift predatory gaze. Sensing my chance but not being able to see what made the sound, I took my split second window. Shouldering my rifle as I turned to my right in a smooth motion, I took aim, the iron sights leveling on the beast before me. A half breath later, my heart hammering I squeezed the trigger. The deafening crack resonated through the darkness as, a silver projectile crossed the distance in a heartbeat to collide centre mass with the Lycan.\n \nA pained bellow that sounded almost human, followed the strike of the bullet as the Lycan snapped its head in my direction. A burst of movement from my left drew my attention as what appeared to be a mountain lion, took as hasty retreat back in the oppressive darkness.\n \nDropping my rifle and drawing my blade in a smooth motion, I turned back to my right in time to see the injured Lycan leaped through the air, bellowing with rage as it covered the distance to me within a few moments. Time slowed, as adrenaline pumped through my veins in preparation for the coming close combat.\n \nBringing my blade across my centre of mass as I dived to the side, I carved a blow into the Lycans side, eliciting a howl of anger and pain. The Lycans razor sharp claw passed through the air I had vacated moments before, as I hit the ground and rolled up onto my feet in a guard position. The Lycan recovered from the blow and we slowly circled each other, neither willing to make the first move. The Lycans breath fogged the cool night air, its wounds causing it obvious pain. Heart hammering and lungs burning, my mind raced. This Lycan was of average size, standing only seven feet tall when bipedal. A juvenile. That certainly explained how it had not landed a hit yet. Cursing myself inwardly at such hubris thoughts I brought my attention back to the still very real threat loping in front of me.\n \nI ducked its next attack, a swipe aimed at my head. I felt the force of the blow as the speed of it caused my hair to ruffle as I took a half step forward and brought my blade up under its arm pit, drawing it back in a slicing motion after it had plunged to the hilt. The effect was instantaneous. The Lycan howled in pain as its arm now useless, dropped to its side. Its other clawed hand holding the wound as it poured warm blood onto muddy ground. Its survival instinct kicking in, the Lycan turned on heel and loped across the clearing. Cursing, I took off after it. I could not let it get away as even that wound would heal given enough time. Despite popular opinion, wounds made with silver would heal, it just took time.\n \nIn my rush I realised I had made a fatal error. I had left my rifle in the mud. Cursing, I considered my options. Break off pursuit for my rifle, knowing that the beast would have time to heal, or continue pursuit and hope it would slow enough from its wounds? If it went back for my rifle, I would have to track its blood trail, a hard task in the dark through mud but not impossible. If I continued after it, I would be at greater risk but would not likely lose it. Lycans were most dangerous when injured and it would only take one mistake for the tables to turn. Snapping back to the present I continued my pursuit, relying on its wounds to slow it.\n \nI didn’t have to chase for long. The Lycans path through the woods took it to a steep outcrop of rock that stretched for hundreds of feet in each direction and rose to several hundred feet into the inky blackness above. The Lycan slowed and turned to face me as I approached. My blade work had been effective enough to slow it down. Cautiously, I moved forward towards the cornered beast. A crack of lightning illuminated the beasts ragged form as it stared at me, its eyes now had lost the burning hatred and had taken on a dimmer countenance of fear. I recognised something in those eyes that I had seen in many beasts like it in my short career. The look of a cursed being who moments before death, fought back against its inner beast for a final chance at humanity. With a final sigh I quickly closed the distance, blade in hand.\n \nI final glimmer of life sparked in the creatures’ eyes, and too late I realised my error. Quicker than I thought possible in its condition the beast sprung, its claws sinking deep into my chest as my blade found its heart. Gasping with pain I spat out a mouthful of blood, the Lycan gave a weak howl and fell backward, its claws withdrawing from my ruined chest as be both fell in a heap to the ground.\n \nLaying on my side, blood streaming from my chest I coughed painfully and my gaze locked with the dying Lycan. The light in its eyes was slowly dimming as its life’s essence pooled onto the ground, mixing with my own. I felt cold, but the pain surprising was gone. I guess the preventatives were not going to save me this time. As the darkness swum in the corners of my vison, I saw the shadow of a human form crouching down next to the Lycan. How long had it been there?\nMy darkening vison flared as the Lycan went up in white hot flames. The light and heat died down as the figure approached me. The last thing I heard before the encroaching darkness consumed me was a deep resonate voice. “Sleep now my friend, your Watch for now at least, has ended”.\n \n "},"522":{"title":"The House That Swallows You Whole","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fdzwwk\/the_house_that_swallows_you_whole\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"AnimationAlive786","selftext":"I’ve rewritten this story a dozen times, but I know it won’t matter. I can’t stop what’s coming. I need to tell someone, anyone, before it’s too late. My name is Daniel Carter, and if you’re reading this, you’re already in danger. Whatever you do, don’t search for Ashvale House. It’s not what you think. It’s not just a house. It’s a predator—a hungry, ancient thing—and it knows when you’re looking for it.\n\nI didn’t believe it either. Not until it was too late.\n\nPart 1: The Invitation\n\nIt all started with an invitation, a letter slipped under my apartment door one cold October morning. I had been expecting bills, maybe a letter from my landlord, but what I found was a crisp, white envelope with no return address. On the front was a single name, hand-written in elegant, flowing script: Daniel Carter.\n\nCuriosity piqued, I opened it. Inside was a thick, yellowing piece of paper, almost like parchment, with faded ink that read:\n\n“You are cordially invited to Ashvale House for a night of discovery and pleasure. The address will reveal itself to those who seek it. RSVP by thinking of what you desire most.”\n\nThere was no contact number, no date or time, and no explanation. I almost laughed and tossed it away. But something about the wording, the weight of the paper, kept me from discarding it. It felt...important, like it was waiting for me to make a choice.\n\nI showed the letter to my roommate, Kyle. “Looks like some kind of escape room gimmick,” he said with a shrug. “Probably a Halloween marketing stunt. You gonna check it out?”\n\nI laughed it off at first, but the words nagged at me: “those who seek it.”Maybe it was the curiosity, or maybe just boredom, but I decided to play along. I held the invitation in my hands and thought about what I desired most.\n\nAt first, nothing happened. But then my phone buzzed. I glanced at it and saw a notification for a new email. The subject line read: “Ashvale House Awaits.”\n\nI should have stopped right there. I should have deleted it and never looked back. But I didn’t.\n\nPart 2: The Search Begins\n\nThe email contained only a link to a map—a single, blinking dot in the middle of nowhere, about a two-hour drive from my place. Kyle was intrigued too. “We should check it out,” he said. “Worst case, it’s a prank. Best case, we get a cool story out of it.”\n\nAnd so, we went. I packed my camera, figuring we could at least document our little adventure. The drive was uneventful, mostly winding roads surrounded by dense forests that seemed to close in the further we went. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched.\n\nWe finally arrived at the location, a nondescript dirt path leading off the main road. There was no sign, no marker, just a rough trail cutting through the trees. I hesitated, but Kyle was already walking ahead. “Come on, man. Don’t chicken out now.”\n\nReluctantly, I followed.\n\nThe path twisted and turned for what felt like miles until, suddenly, the trees parted, revealing a clearing. And there it was: Ashvale House.\n\nIt looked like something out of a nightmare—a massive, crumbling Victorian mansion with boarded-up windows and ivy choking its walls. But the strangest thing was that it felt… alive. The air around it was thick, heavy with a stench of rot and earth, like the house itself was breathing.\n\n“Damn,” Kyle whispered, snapping pictures with his phone. “This place is creepy as hell.”\n\nWe should have left. We should have turned around right then and there. But the door was open, just a crack, as if it were inviting us in. And so, we entered.\n\nPart 3: The House of Mirrors\n\nThe inside was even more unsettling. The air was cold, much colder than it should have been, and each step echoed as if the house were hollow. The walls were lined with mirrors of every shape and size, all facing the hallway, reflecting endless versions of ourselves. Some of the mirrors were broken, others covered in dust, but each one seemed to distort our reflections just slightly, as if the glass itself was warped.\n\nWe wandered through room after room, each more bizarre than the last—rooms filled with rotting furniture, old dolls with missing eyes, paintings of people with blurred faces. In every room, more mirrors. And in each mirror, our reflections seemed a little less… us. I could swear I saw Kyle’s reflection smile when he hadn’t.\n\n“This place is insane,” Kyle muttered, trying to brush off the eerie feeling. But I could see the tension in his eyes. “Let’s find the exit,” I said, trying to mask my own fear. But when we turned around, the hallway behind us was gone. Instead, there was another room, filled with more mirrors.\n\nKyle laughed nervously. “Okay, very funny. Whoever set this up, you got us. Let’s just go.”\n\nBut no one answered. The air grew colder, and that smell of rot intensified. Panic began to set in. We tried to backtrack, but the house seemed to change around us. Hallways led to dead ends, doors opened into the same room we just left. And always, the mirrors.\n\nThen I noticed it. In one of the mirrors, there was an extra reflection—a dark figure standing just behind Kyle. I whipped around, but no one was there. “What is it?” Kyle asked, his voice shaking. I didn’t answer.\n\n“Let’s just keep moving,” I said, my voice barely more than a whisper. I didn’t have the heart to tell him what I’d seen.\n\nPart 4: The Whispering Walls\n\nAs we continued, the house seemed to come alive. The walls creaked and groaned like an old ship at sea, and faint whispers filled the air, like distant voices just beyond our reach. We stumbled into what must have once been a grand ballroom. Its ceiling was impossibly high, covered in cobwebs and darkness.\n\nIn the center of the room stood a grand mirror, different from the others. It was tall, almost reaching the ceiling, with an ornate golden frame that seemed untouched by time. The glass, however, was covered in thick, black grime, as if hiding something behind it.\n\n“Maybe this is the way out,” Kyle suggested, his voice quivering. He reached out and touched the mirror, and the grime began to peel away, revealing not his reflection, but a dark, endless void.\n\nI tried to pull him back, but it was too late. The void reached out, like an inky tendril, wrapping around his wrist. He screamed, trying to pull away, but the tendril tightened its grip, dragging him closer. I grabbed his other arm, trying to pull him free, but the darkness was too strong.\n\n“Don’t let go!” he screamed, his eyes wide with terror. I held on as long as I could, but the void was pulling harder, and harder, and harder. My grip slipped, and Kyle was pulled into the mirror, disappearing into the darkness. The grime on the mirror returned, sealing it shut as if it had never opened.\n\nI pounded on the glass, screaming his name, but there was no response. Just my own reflection staring back at me—except, it wasn’t my reflection. The eyes were wrong, too wide, too dark. It smiled.\n\nPart 5: The House Changes You\n\nI don’t remember much after that. I ran, my mind a blur of panic and terror. Every hallway twisted, every door led back to the same room. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, until I could make out words.“Stay with us, Daniel. Stay forever.”\n\nI stumbled into a small, dusty bedroom and slammed the door behind me. My breath came in ragged gasps. There was a mirror on the wall, but I couldn’t bring myself to look at it. Instead, I curled up in the corner, my back to the wall, and tried to think.\n\nBut thinking didn’t help. The whispers were in my head now, echoing through my skull, mixing with my own thoughts. I felt something crawling beneath my skin, something dark and ancient. I knew then that I was trapped. There was no way out. \n\nThen I saw it—the door on the far side of the room, slightly ajar. A glimmer of hope sparked in my chest. I moved towards it slowly, every instinct screaming to turn back, but I had no choice. As I reached for the handle, the door swung open on its own.\n\nThere, on the other side, was Kyle. But it wasn’t him. His eyes were wrong, too wide, too dark. He smiled.\n\n“Come on, man,” he said, his voice too calm. “We can leave now. It’s over.”\n\nI wanted to believe him, but I could feel the house laughing at me, mocking me. I knew this wasn’t Kyle. It was something else, something using his face.\n\n“No,” I said, stepping back. “You’re not him.”\n\nHis smile widened, and his eyes darkened, turning into deep pits of black"},"523":{"title":"Is K Banning ever going to finish his Jeff The Killer stories?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fe356m\/is_k_banning_ever_going_to_finish_his_jeff_the\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Beginning-Manager554","selftext":"Let it be known that I do not have Instagram, or tumblr, or twitter or anything.

The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and I was excited to finally have a weekend free of obligations. My friend Sarah had invited me over for a small gathering at her new apartment, and I was looking forward to catching up with her and a few other friends. It felt like the perfect way to unwind after a long week at work.\n\nAs I arrived at Sarah's place, I was greeted by the warm, inviting scent of freshly baked cookies wafting through the air. The apartment was cozy, adorned with colorful decorations and filled with laughter as friends mingled and chatted. I spotted Sarah in the kitchen, her hair pulled up in a messy bun, baking sheet in hand. She looked radiant, and I couldn’t help but smile as I embraced her.\n\n“Glad you could make it!” she exclaimed, pulling me into a tight hug. “We’re just about to start a game. You’ll love it!”\n\nI followed her into the living room, where a group of friends had gathered around a large coffee table, a board game sprawled out in front of them. It was one of those games designed to test your creativity and wit, and I was eager to join in the fun. As we played, the atmosphere was lively and light-hearted, filled with friendly banter and laughter.\n\nBut as the night wore on, the mood began to shift. After several rounds, Sarah suggested we play a different game—one she had recently discovered. She pulled out an old, ornate box and set it on the table. I hadn’t seen it before, and its intricate carvings intrigued me.\n\n“What’s that?” I asked, curiosity piqued.\n\n“It’s a game called ‘The Seer’s Prophecy.’ I found it in an antique store,” Sarah replied, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “They say it’s a bit unconventional.”\n\nA few of our friends exchanged skeptical glances, but Sarah’s enthusiasm was infectious. “Come on, it’ll be fun! It’s just a game, right?”\n\nReluctantly, we agreed to give it a try. Sarah opened the box, revealing an unusual set of cards and a small crystal orb. She explained the rules, which seemed straightforward enough: we would take turns drawing a card and following the instructions written on it. Some cards would prompt us to share secrets, while others would ask us to perform silly tasks. It sounded harmless.\n\nThe first few rounds passed without incident. We laughed and shared stories, the atmosphere light and carefree. But then it was my turn. I reached into the box and pulled out a card with a cryptic message: “Face your fears or lose a part of your soul.” \n\n“Sounds intense,” one of my friends joked, but I felt a twinge of unease. “What does that even mean?”\n\n“Just do it!” Sarah encouraged, her excitement palpable. “It’s all in good fun.”\n\nI took a deep breath and closed my eyes, trying to think of something that truly scared me. I had always been afraid of darkness, of not knowing what lurked just beyond my vision. I decided to share that fear with the group, hoping it would lighten the mood. \n\n“I guess I’m afraid of the dark and being alone,” I admitted, my voice wavering slightly. The room fell silent, and I could see the concern on my friends’ faces. \n\n“Don’t worry, we’re all here,” Sarah said reassuringly. \n\nI smiled weakly, grateful for their support. But then I felt a chill sweep through the room, as if a cold draft had suddenly entered. The lights flickered briefly, but I brushed it off as a coincidence. \n\nAfter a few more rounds, Sarah drew a card that told her to summon the spirits in the room. She laughed it off, but I noticed her expression shift slightly, as if something had darkened behind her eyes. \n\n“Okay, everyone, let’s get serious for a moment,” she said, her voice suddenly low and husky. “We need to focus. Just for fun, let’s see if we can really connect with something.”\n\nI felt a knot form in my stomach, but everyone else eagerly agreed. Sarah placed the crystal orb in the center of the table and instructed us to hold hands, forming a circle. The atmosphere was tense, and I could feel my heart racing.\n\n“Close your eyes and concentrate,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Let’s see if we can invite something in.”\n\nAs we sat in silence, I felt a strange energy fill the room. It was as if the air had thickened, and an uncomfortable weight pressed down on us. I opened my eyes to glance around, but everyone else was lost in concentration.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a soft whisper, barely audible, drifting through the air. “Mine… now…” The voice sent a shiver down my spine, and I instinctively pulled away from the circle. \n\n“What was that?” I blurted out, my heart pounding. \n\n“What was what?” Sarah asked, opening her eyes. \n\n“I heard a voice!” \n\nMy friends exchanged uneasy glances, and I could see doubt creeping into their expressions. “You’re just imagining things,” one of them said, but I could tell they were all on edge, the lighthearted atmosphere evaporating.\n\nWe decided to continue playing, but the fun had dissipated, replaced by an uneasy tension. The lights flickered again, and this time, they dimmed significantly. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over me, and I wished I had never agreed to play this game.\n\nAs the night wore on, strange occurrences began to unfold. Objects shifted slightly on the table, and shadows danced at the edges of my vision. My friends still laughed and joked, but I could sense that they were just as unsettled as I was. \n\nThen, Sarah drew a card that instructed her to speak to the spirits directly. She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. “Is there anyone here with us?” she called out, her voice steady but shaky. \n\nThe atmosphere shifted dramatically. The air grew colder, and an oppressive silence filled the room. In that moment, I felt an overwhelming sense of foreboding, as if something ancient and malevolent was stirring. \n\nSuddenly, the lights went out completely, plunging us into darkness. Panic erupted as we scrambled for our phones, the glow of their screens illuminating terrified faces. \n\n“Did anyone pay the electric bill?” one friend joked nervously, but the laughter felt hollow. \n\nSarah’s voice pierced through the darkness. “Everyone, stay calm! Let’s just sit tight until the power comes back.” \n\nBut it didn’t come back. Instead, we heard a soft scratching sound, like fingernails dragging against wood. My heart raced as I looked around, trying to pinpoint the source of the noise. \n\n“Is anyone playing a prank?” I called out, my voice trembling. \n\n“Not me!” another friend replied, equally terrified. \n\nThe scratching grew louder, echoing through the darkness. I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back. “We need to get out of here,” I said, my voice rising in panic. \n\nBut just as I turned to reach for the door, a sudden force slammed it shut. I jumped back, heart racing. “What the hell was that?” I shouted, fear coursing through me. \n\n“Try to open it!” Sarah yelled, but it wouldn’t budge. The scratching noise intensified, now accompanied by muffled whispers, echoing through the room. \n\n“Mine… now…” The voice was clearer, more insistent this time. It filled me with an overwhelming sense of dread. \n\nIn that moment, I knew I hadn’t imagined shit. Whatever had been summoned was angry, and we had unwittingly invited it into our lives. \n\nFrantically, we tried to push against the door, but it felt as if an invisible force held it shut. I could feel my friends’ panic rising, their voices blending together in a cacophony of fear. \n\n“Calm down!” I shouted, trying to regain some control. “We need to think!” \n\nBut it was too late. The whispers grew louder, drowning out my thoughts. I felt a cold breeze sweep through the room, and suddenly the lights flickered back to life. \n\nWhat we saw next would haunt me forever. In the corner of the room stood a dark figure, its features obscured by shadows. It was tall and menacing, its presence suffocating. The air grew heavy with despair, and I felt an overwhelming urge to flee. \n\n“Get away from us!” Sarah screamed, backing away. \n\nThe figure moved closer, and I could see its eyes—dark, hollow voids that seemed to absorb the light. It raised a hand, and I felt a surge of cold wash over me, as if it were reaching into my very soul. \n\nIn that moment, every instinct screamed for me to run. I lunged for the door, throwing my weight against it, and finally, it gave way. We burst out into the hallway, gasping for breath, but something pulled at me, anchoring me back to the room. \n\n“Keep going!” one friend shouted, and I forced myself to turn away from the darkness. \n\nWe stumbled down the stairs, our hearts racing, desperate to escape. The whispers faded behind us, but I could still feel the weight of the figure lingering in the air. \n\nWe rushed outside into the cool night, gasping for air as we stumbled away from the building. The streetlights flickered ominously as we gathered, shaking and terrified. \n\n“What the hell just happened?” I breathed, my voice trembling. \n\n“That game was a mistake!” Sarah exclaimed, her face pale. \n\nWe stood there, shivering in the night air, trying to process what had just occurred. The shadows of the building loomed behind us, and I could feel the weight of its darkness pressing down, threatening to pull us back in.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and life returned to a semblance of normalcy, but the memory of that night haunted me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever we had awakened was still lurking, waiting for the right moment to strike. \n\nI began to notice strange occurrences in my life—items going missing, flickering lights, and an ever-present sense of being watched. My dreams were plagued with visions of the dark figure, its hollow eyes staring back at me, reminding me of the night we invited darkness into our lives.\n\nIt wasn’t until one fateful evening, as I sat alone in my apartment, that everything changed. The lights flickered, and a cold draft swept through the room. My heart raced as I felt a familiar presence, the whispers returning, echoing in my mind.\n\n“Mine… now…”\n\nI knew then that the darkness had found me. The game was not over; it had merely begun. I had opened a door I could never close, and the shadows were ready to claim what was theirs. \n\nIn that moment, I understood the true horror of our actions. Some games are best left unplayed, some doors forever locked, and some spirits eternally undisturbed. But now, there is no turning back. The darkness is here, and I am trapped in its grasp."},"528":{"title":"If anyone has any creepy stories that happened to them write them down for me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fduxqk\/if_anyone_has_any_creepy_stories_that_happened_to\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Tatiii01","selftext":"I’ve made YouTube channel and I’m planning to make people stories into audiobooks on YouTube so if u have any interesting stories write them for me and I’ll make it into audiobooks!

I wish I could share this strange hobby with people close to me but I cannot. I want to scream out loud to someone and tell them that I love being black mailed. I have hired some guys to black mail me. \n\nI pay those guys a good amount of money and they follow me around and take pictures of me doing stuff. I robbed an old lady and then I started getting black mailed. It came through the post and it had pictures of me robbing an old lady. They were demanding money and I was disappointed with this level of black mailing. I paid them good money for this poor level of black mailing I was disappointed. It's annoying how you can never get the services that you paid for. I went back to those guys to complain. \n\nI told them how they are terrible black mailers and that they need to try harder. They then told me that for them to up the notch in black mailing me, I will need to up the notch in doing crimes. It all made sense and I questioned myself again as to why I loved getting black mailed? Why was I doing this? Any how I had to concentrate on upping my crime to get a better blackmail threat.

Then something came out of his stomach and it was like an octopus creature and it was making screaming like noises. Then it went back inside the man's gut. The man then collapsed to the ground dead. The octopus like creature was gurgling for life inside the man's gut, it was giving me the evil stare. I guess it can't survive without the man being alive. It then died. \n\nAt home i recieved the best blackmail I had ever gotten. The guys I paid to black mail me, have photographed me killing that guy. They want me to chop off the human head that is attached to my goat. I don't know why I enjoy getting blackmailed.

I have no love to give and all I want is what I want. My parents didn't make me like this, but I simply am like this. \n\nThen consequences did reach me when I over worked a servant and starved her. I did not even pay her properly. So now I will be punished by this act of mine and not by being sent to prison. No society had other ideas to teach me a lesson.

They love seeing someone like me fall. \n\nIn my mind all I could think about how poor and dirty these poor folk were. Now I was going to be like them, and the homeless man's soul was going to be in my body now. In all honesty I wasn't so worried and I smiled at the homeless man.

I found it at the creepypasta wiki website. \n\nNOTE: This is a recreation of a once-lost creepypasta that was recently rediscovered.\n\nEven now I wonder if it was not that damnable Siberian cold that brought the spell upon us of group hysteria and shared hallucination. What else might account for the realization in the flesh of those horrid Nietzschean words? It is dead, and we have killed it. I dare not speak its name.\n\nVividly I recall descriptions of the men stretching that accursed pelt between them for the photographer, and the uncanny lens flare that bastardized the picture upon development, which none of them had witnessed at the time. I am by no means a spiritual man, raised in a time of such ration and science, never given to superstition of the trappings of myth. How stupefyingly ironic that now I should wish for some power to call upon, to prostrate to, to beg for mercy! Now that we can be sure, in the vast cosmos beyond the farthest reach of our astronomical instruments, there is nothing to answer back but howling silence. Understand I have seen things during the Wars no man should, and indeed, I had thought no man could. I recall a photograph of uncanny resemblance to that I have mentioned, and though I was not present for the ordeal I had it recanted to me later in gruesome detail and shown the physical evidence, forever imprinted by some disturbed photographer.\n\nIt was a deed borne out of the Continuation War, and our men found themselves behind enemy lines and desperate. Why they acted upon such base and ravenous instinct, I can fathom. It is an unfortunate relic of our primitive past, sometimes visited in times of unimaginable duress. But why they chose to capture that moment, as if to memorialize it, freeze it as solidly as the Finnish hellscape around them, I know not. In the photograph was spread between several branches and stretched taught by a hand of some obscured soldier the skin of a former comrade. The effect was like the pale wings of an angel, or some monstrous, too human bat animate in the trees. On a nearby cart were placed the remaining effluence: a portion of leg, a frostbitten hand, and most terrible of all, the head of a man betrayed by his fellows, eyes closed to the deep cold as if asleep. He could not have been more than twenty in life. These, and other atrocities I witnessed during the war, but it all seems a distant memory now, remains of a more innocent time. I recall those wicked pictures of man's barbarity only because they pale in comparison to those procured on that expedition.\n\nWe had not travelled into the inhospitable country for any tangible purpose. A colleague, whose name was Richard Tater, had proposed a most absurd hypothesis, being as much a man of science as he was of a Catholic upbringing, whose tenets never left him even as he rose to prominence in his field as a geologist and historian. We were both of us veterans of the Wars, and had the misfortune of living to see the first volleys of a third which began in some remote eastern country, promising to be worse than its predecessors. He divulged me his belief - for it was a stretch to call it a testable hypothesis - that God had abandoned humanity to its own designs, as evidenced by the succession of wars and the advent of such horrors such as mustard gas and the atomic bomb. I asked Richard in jest what God then did with all his endless time, if not watch over the panorama of earth. Where I expected a jocular retort, my companion's eyes sank and he quieted. Without a word he retrieved from his office desk a filthy little book, like the personal journal of some rustic frontiersman. Opening it before me, it showed minute, cramped text of undecipherable content. I asked him what language he proposed it.\n\n\"The language of YHWH, which I have spent the last year translating portions of. It seems to follow some old Sanskrit variety, with odd instances of Greek, Roman and even modern Russian. I recovered it during a geological survey for the hydroelectric powerplants along the Angara, in a remote cabin of sparse and crude furnishing. Believe me, no man would live out there and thrive, let alone survive. Nothing of the environs showed the tell tale instruments of a trapper. There was not even a fire pit for cooking, or a bed. It was barren but clearly maintained and of solid construction. But listen to me now. In a year I have translated but one sentence out of the four hundred or so pages; one sentence within those cramped, maddeningly condensed lines of prose. It read: 'I will hide.' And the signature at the very end of the weird novel, in unmistakable English - YHWH.\"\n\nWhat seemed to disturb poor Richard the most was the memoir's evident state of completion, the details of which remained a mystery to him. His odd behavior over the past year had not gone unnoticed by me, but I had reasoned it no more than the strain of an overworked scholar, and the pressing little pains of old age. And yet here he stood, refusing to budge on his artifact's authenticity. That it was real, I could attest to. That some person had signed those uncanny initials I agreed, but to go so far as to say the Lord himself had penned this? It was nonsense of the most disturbing kind. But Richard would not be assuaged. I decided on a leave of absence for the both of us, hoping another trip to that shack, which was no doubt long ruined by the elements, would put to ease his overtaxed mind, and he would again see rationally. With that agenda we set into Siberia, taking the Baikal–Amur Mainline a portion of the way, a great marvel of engineering begun by those droves of German and Japanese prisoners of war, and finished by the willing hands of Russian youths years later. Richard fidgeted with his accursed book throughout the trip, as if he might yet glean some information from its ramblings. He eschewed the countryside we passed by, but at one interval made a strange observation: \"If the permafrost were ever to melt, the rails and the doomed train upon them would sink into the peat bogs below.\" He followed this with no explanation and was silent until we departed for the on foot portion of our journey.\n\nOf that cold, quiet trek I can say little. Richard busied himself with the book, more engrossed with it than before, so that the task of navigation fell wholly upon myself, with only the occasional hint from my colleague as to where his phantom shack lie. By some mad sixth sense or luck, he led us to the spot without taking much attention away from his reading, and there the cabin stood. Snow banks had nearly covered it and we set about the task of digging a path to the only door, a labor Richard never faltered in. He pushed inside with zealous determination, and his previous description proved true. The lone room contained nothing of import, besides a stool and table or poor construction. If Richard had hoped to find the Lord Almighty sat at his throne, surrounded by singing cherubs, he was sorely disappointed. But he made no inclination of despair. That the cabin were here seemed proof enough for him, and he insisted upon sitting at that ugly little table and examining the book further, as he'd done for the past year. I did not fight him greatly on this, hoping an hour or so of contemplation might break his trance, but as I shivered outside I became increasingly worried about the man. After an hour had passed according to my watch, he burst from the forlorn abode, wild eyed, and for a brief moment I feared him.\n\n\"The notebooks!\" he said. \"Give me the notebooks!\" We had brought with us, amongst the more practical supplies, our usual scholarly equipment - plenty of paper and pens. He could not wait for me to search the packs and tore into them, tossing out items into the snow with abandon till he attained his prize, and with that he returned to the desk inside, not even shutting the door behind him. With reluctance I'll never understand, but know now was all too warranted, I approached him from behind. His shoulders and arm which held the pen convulsed, as if he'd suffered some seizure, or the cold had gotten to him. I called his name and no answer came. And when I stood over him, so that I could see what he was transcribing to the blank pages, I felt sickened.\n\nNo man could write so quickly, so feverishly. His hand moved like an insects wings, if not with greater rapidity. In seconds he would fill a page and move on to the next. I realized with terror that his outlandish exercise in dexterity was not producing gibberish, as I had presumed, but legible Russian characters. Though the frequency with which he turned the pages, and moved onto another book when the former made detailed analysis impossible, I gleaned from a few stray sentences that he seemed to be dictating the entirety of the Holy Bible, as if by memory. But all the time he held in his other hand that accursed journal, which he would study even as he wrote. I refused to believe he was actually translating that demented relic. Surely a man of his background could recite the Bible in whole - it was not unheard of in dedicated men. But in minutes he'd concluded the Book of Revelations and went on still writing, still glancing over at his find, and this madness continued on for perhaps forty minutes, until he'd filled every scrap of blank paper we'd brought. The insane spell seemed to leave him, for he sat at the desk at last still, breathing heavily, perspiration covering him despite the cold.\n\nHe set the old journal aside and turned in his seat to me. I shall never forget his eyes and the multitudes of sorrows and horrors they contained. Those were not Richard's eyes. It was not Richard's voice which spoke, but some destroyed thing. \"We killed him. We killed him. We really killed him.\" This he repeated, and none of my rousing broke him from the stupor.\n\nHe soon lost his strength and slid his body against one of the walls, sitting helplessly, mumbling to himself. I knew we were in trouble now, with my companion's state. I prepared us a meal with the portable cooking set and insisted he eat something, which he did without passion and only at my urging. I hoped to give him time to regain his strength and wits, so we might make the journey back. In the meantime, the table and its scattered books drew my attention. I did not want to feed into his delusions, but I conjectured that perhaps his ramblings held some key to his sudden manic state. I began with the first book. As previously mentioned, this was an accurate recitation of the King James' Bible, but not without deviation that perplexed me. I am no theologian, but even my cursory knowledge of the text within told me this translation had additions, some entire paragraphs long which no Bible contained. These addendums and divergences ranged from major alterations to the original text, to completely novel passages adding detail to, or even disputing the chapters. On and on this went, and it seemed no page survived unaltered. I could bare no more of it, and proceeded to the Book of Revelations, whose details, already strange and appalling, had taken on unfathomable terror and clarity.\n\nBeyond this translation began what I assumed to be a first person journal. It began, 'I am', and recanted an unbelievable tale, like some dark forgotten mythology. That these words were born out of Richard's imagination sickened me. Truly it seemed he had convinced himself he was translating the very memoirs of God in the flesh, who had come down from the heavens, taken mortal form as his son before him, and hid away in the forests, as far from man as he might go, to chronicle, and then forget his bastard creation. Such vivid descriptions of lunacy followed, I wondered if I had not myself dreamed up that dreadful read. He described the angels being boiled into a great soup and consumed before his departure, so he would not need to feast upon the animals or plants of the world. Recounted in detail was the agony of taking physical form, the condensing of his totality into one singularity, which took years to settle into a satisfactory shape. He described those years as liquid wandering, a ghost of bloody mist and fledgling effluence haunting the forests. He spoke of the wars with such apathetic detachment, I wondered how cruel such a person must be to describe suffering in so callous of terms.\n\nAs the diatribe proceeded, it became a rant of exceptional length. Again and again the writer insisted he was without blame, without guilt, wholly inviolate in every respect. The degradation of his supreme consciousness to a mere mass of fat and electric impulse agonized him, and seemed to instill in him a kind of lunacy. Of all men, he praised the Hitlers, the Stalins, the Genghis Khans and so many nameless butchers which fill our headlines with garish acts of depravity against their fellow man. They held the key to heaven, he said. I tossed the book away, and was prepared to leave at once, but Richard suddenly stood erect and took my hand. He looked into my eyes with steeled determination, not the mindless sorrow he previously expressed. \"Read the rest,\" he said. \"Read the rest.\" I took it that he had no intention of allowing our departure until I had obliged him, and feared what state might overcome him at my refusal. So I began on the last book, and its contents disarmed me of all reason and rationality, as their creation evidently had poor Richard.\n\nThe narrator gave no year. I deduced from the descriptions of labor camps that it was some short time following the second war. The Red Army had found him by chance alone, and at once knew they looked upon the face of God, though that face be a jumbled mess of eyes, nose, beard and ragged hair, a person completely dispensed from humanity. The military men and scientists did not behold him with awe, but terror, and they did not fall at his feet to worship him and offer tears, but at once bound him as a prisoner and drug him off to a facility. Such was his deterioration at this point he could not resist.\n\nAn inborn hatred enraptured his captors. Some primordial revulsion toward their discovery drove them on. Even the scientists who were tasked with analysis of the specimen, in hopes it might hold secrets beneficial to the Soviets rushed through their task, and only timidly approached the straight-jacketed stranger, not for fear but disgust. Some scientific value seemed to be gleamed from him, and if more was to come, the officers put a stop to it. For ten years they executed it, that bleary-eyed creature which called itself YHWH when it could yet speak. It survived firing squad, writhed at a noose's end for months, endured burning and electrocution. But each new torture seemed to chip away at at the will and constitution of the dreaded prisoner. At last, several hydrogen explosions, detonated in succession, proved effective in penetrating him. He was like a burn victim, and his condition by now so catastrophic that when a lone officer approached him and discharged a single shot from his pistol, it dispatched the thing. Officially, he was executed for crimes against humanity.\n\nTrembling, I seemed to come in and out of my senses. I rallied enough scientific rigor to ask Richard how this narrative had continued, if its author was thus bound and abused. Richard answered without passion. \"They allowed him to keep writing, to document everything inflicted upon him, and he wrote till the end, until they detonated the first bomb and took away the journal. He knew then that he would die.\"\n\nI can only speculate what has become of Richard since that dreadful excursion. He has vanished, and I fear the worst for him. Even now I question my recollection of events, without the sole witness to verify my memory. I inquired with a personal friend who held a high position in the military, and he only laughed off my vague questions, and I don't blame him. Of course no such madness had accrued, and if by some unfathomable chance it had, there would be no record of its occurrence. Before his absconding, Richard took with him the journal and his apparent translations, and nothing of the event remains except what I write now. Truly I had thought to bury the whole thing in the recesses of my mind, accept it for the sad deterioration of a once proud man it was. But a certain creeping suspicion, lingering on the borders of my aged imagination, compelled me to save this for posterity, even as I suspect such an action to soon be moot.\n\nForgive me a philosophical digression, which is not in my normal fashion but possibly befitting this narratives' conclusion. If that thing which I shall not name was killed for crimes against humanity, and our world yet persists, does that paradox not yield the conclusion that we are somehow rid of a great, unknowable evil that has prevailed over us since the dawn of time? Should we not see a new age upon us, as those hopeful youths proclaim in song? If the source is cut off, where then do the new terrors emerge from? Why did the world not simply disperse as Richard has? And why, as I lay to bed at night and peer into the endless void on cloudless evenings, do my failing eyes perceive fewer and fewer stars each passing day?\n\nWe had already found him. God is dead, and we killed him.\n\n\n\nWritten by Char Rennes\n\n\n"},"540":{"title":"I feel like\nsomeone since when i 7 years old, always watching me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fdi7ya\/i_feel_like_someone_since_when_i_7_years_old\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"makcuhin","selftext":"All started when I was 7 years old, when i life at my grandmother's cottage on the summer. I spent the night in the same bed with her, and there was a window across from us (there was a thunderstorm at that time), and I had a nightmare that I was sitting near to a giant window, and a fox started looking at me from there (surprisingly, but the fox looked like Kurama from Naruto , although I didn't even know what it was then). And he looked at me with a glassy gaze, and all I could do was try to say something, but my mouth was as if sewn shut. It would seem that was all, but then the feeling of anxiety did not leave me for the next few weeks. I lived in an apartment, on the 9th floor, and every time I climbed the ladder to my floor, I constantly felt as if someone was behind me. And now 2 years have passed. \n\nReturning home already in the evening, I climb the ladder, and I decide to look down, and I see how someone is looking at me.

I quickly run into the apartment and hope that everything will be fine. After that, my insomnia developed, and the first dream I had, when I was able to sleep normally for the first time, was like a man looking at me again, but I saw it looking out the window. \n\nFast forward 3 years. I am already 12, and it was a relative's birthday. I just sat in the next room and watched videos on YouTube. How here I felt a long-forgotten feeling - that someone was watching me. I just tried not to pay attention, since all my relatives were sitting in the next room, and what could happen. But this feeling did not leave me, until the trip home, like here when we were going (we were on the street, where there was only a forest and everything) already to leave, I decided to look around, and I saw that the cat had been looking at one point for 20 minutes, and he was looking directly into the window of the restaurant. Looking, I saw a man, I could already see his face, but he was just looking at the wall. It looked like when I turned around he decided to just start looking at the wall so I wouldn't see him looking at me. I decided to quickly get into the car and continue watching YouTube\n\nIf you are interested in something else about this, just write that you want more such stories.

Cipher climbed towards the Grotto. Approaching the summit, he pulls himself up and over the slate overhang bordering the cave entrance. Casting his eyes into the stygian gloom of the mossy aperture, Cipher reaches to his right shoulder and clicks on the red beam of his L-Torch. The faded red light barely illuminates the dark entry as he takes a measured step into the gloom.\n \nThe faint red light bounces off the dark slate walls of the Grotto, as Cipher approaches a broken stalagmite upon which sits an open topped mossy log. It is here his orders await him. The Grotto had been used for decades by members of his Order; its high peaks made it an ideal place to hide such things. Taking the note out he reads;\n \nPossible cryptid target\nLocation – Smokey Mountains Resort and Spa\nDetails – Missing patrons over the last month. Reports of icy blasts of cold followed by the stench of rotting wood. Locals warned patrons to avoid the Resort. Advice was ignored. Fear imminent incursion’\n \n \nSighing audibly, he neatly folds the paper and pockets it. ‘This makes little sense’, he mutters. Confused at the lack of information, he runs through a quick list in his head of possible targets. Demon? Jinn? A thought hits him as the third creature appears in his mind’s eye. ‘It can’t be’, he groans. If the creature was indeed what he had envisioned, this must be either a joke or a harsh test of his skill. His master must think he is ready. Shrugging to himself he steps out towards the cave entrance, to begin the treacherous climb down to the trail leading to his car. \n \n \n \nCipher pulls up to the outskirts of the resort as the cold winter rain partially obscures his view. Nestled into a crook between two connecting rock outcrops lies The Great Smokey Mountains Resort and Spa. Located deep in the Appalachians, the resort had seen a down turn of late. Cipher knew why and was here to stop it. Glancing out of the front windscreen through the gloom of rain and foreboding darkness, his eyes notice the warm glow coming from windows of the wooden chalets, acting as an inviting beacon for any weary traveller. It had been a long drive from The Grotto, the darkness of the night made it difficult to see. Shrugging to himself he steps out of the warmth of his vehicle and into the driving rain.\n \n \nOther than the banging of loose window shutters, the only sound audible is the howling of the growing storm and the scrape of tree branches on wooden walls. Reaching into the trunk of his car, he equips himself with his rifle, hunting knife and other necessary equipment of his work. The second thing he notices is the smell. Burning wood gives way to rot and decay as he slowly approaches the wooden entry doors to the main building. Shivering in the damp air, he opens the doors with a creak and enters, shutting the door to the outside storm.  \n \nThe sight that meets his eyes sends a chill down his spine. Bodies and blood. Scattered throughout the lobby lay the tattered and broken remains of men, women…and children. This last sight amongst the broken remnants of furniture and smashed wood causes him to drop to one knee momentarily, resisting the urge the vomit. In the year that he had been pursuing his profession he had never seen such carnage. Approaching the closest body, that of a young adult male, he starts his investigation.\n \nBurning eyes peer in through the pane glass window at the kneeling human inside. A low growl emits from its broken lips as another stab of hunger pain wracks its emaciated form. It would break, it would tear and it would feed on this, its newest prey.\n \nA small shiver runs up Ciphers spine as he examines the corpse. A feeling of dread fills him as a gust of icy wind blows open a window to his right. The blast of air carries the same stench of rot and decay as he had smelt earlier. Slowly raising his rifle, he peers at the window. A lightning crack outside resolves a shape for a split second before the darkness creeps back and the shadow dissipates. ‘What the hell’, he murmured. Breathing deeply, he waits a moment, his ears straining to hear…nothing. Heart hammering in his chest he returns his gaze to the mangled body. It was a mess. Pulped chest and a face stuck in a rictus expression of despair. Upon further examination of the corpse, he realises it was missing the liver. A few things he knew would be so selective and none of them he wished to face alone. A creeping fear fills his mind as he slowly rises to his feet and continues through the main lobby, to a door that leads to a darkened hallway with a sign above. ‘Spa house’\n \nWith bestial speed the emaciated creature leaps upwards, its sharp claws digging into the wooden frame of the building. With fervour it follows its prey from a parallel rooftop. Sticking to the shadows, it remains cloaked from the human’s sight as it prowls forward.\n \nCipher continues down the dark hallway, his nerves on a razors edge after his encounter in the lobby. He felt anxious, sweat from his brow running down his cheek as he contemplates the shadow he saw from the window. It was only there for a second, he thought. As he continues down the darkened hallway, he notices it is covered with over turned tables, the wooden floors clotted with dried blood, the walls covered with deep claw marks. Based off the bodies he had seen in the lobby and the lack of copper smell from the blood, he figures that this had happened less than a day ago. Was the creature alone? Or had it done this with aid?\n \nHe continues steadily down the hallway until he arrives at an ajar door leading to what was clearly the Spa House. Turning on his shoulder torch, his gaze falls upon what the red light illuminates. A spa still running, bloody water on the floor next to a table carrying damp towels next to assorted body and hair oils. Walking further into the room, he starts to kneel down and examine the spa when a deafening crash to his right is followed by a keening screech.\n \nThe Wendigo, having followed its prey from the dark and rainy night, plunges powerfully through the wall it faced. Wood gives way as if made of paper, the human turns to raise its weapon. Late, much too late. Battering the weapon aside it howls and sinks its claws deep.\n \nScreaming in anger Cypher loses control of his weapon as the powerful blow catches him off guard. The Wendigo sinks its claws further into his shoulder. He could feel the claws scrape against bone as sweat starts beading on his forehead. He struggles to reach for his combat knife, whilst using his free hand to hold the creature by the throat, in a semi vain attempt stall its ravenous assault. Snarling with effort, the Wendigo snaps at Cyphers face as his hand nears his knife. Twisting his body weight with the movement of the creatures next attack, Cypher over balances the Wendigo with a kick to its emaciated legs. Using the moment of surprise, he draws his knife in a smooth motion and brings it down into the side of the creatures neck. Warm vitae squirts across his face as the stunned Wendigo howls in pain and fury. Wasting no time, Cypher twists and wrenches the blade right then left to sever the main arteries, bringing the Wendigo, now drowning in its own blood crashing to the floor. Pulling the blade back for a final strike, Cypher brings it down with all his force through the top of the skull into the brain, stilling the creature for good.\n \nTaking a gasping breath, Cypher collapses to the tiled floor, hand clutching the soon to be serious shoulder wound, as it spills his own blood to mix with the dark mess of the Wendigo currently pooling on the ground. The darkness pools in at the edge of his vision, and he slowly closes his eyes.\n \nWaking with a gasp, Cyphers’ head spins as he painfully rises to his knees, his wounds now dry and closing but still aching. A tool of the trade he was told by his master during his training. His Order had access to ancient but obviously he now realised, effective alchemical preventatives. Using such things came at a cost however. Looking down at his frame, Cypher runs his hands over his aching muscles and feels a distinct lessening of muscle mass. The ability to nit muscle, bone and sinew at a supernatural rate had to draw its energy from somewhere. He had avoided using such things when he started with the Order but the last few hunts and required the insurance policy up front, lest he fail in his mission. Shakily rising to his feet, he looks down at the corpse of the Wendigo and lets out a short breath of relief as he notices it has yet to regenerate. He must not have lost consciousness for long. Reaching into his jacket pocket he pulls out a small vial of translucent amber liquid. Carefully unscrewing the seal, he pours the contents over the Wendigo and steps back as hissing and rising smoke immediately engulf the creature. Seconds later, the Wendigo erupts into white hot flames. Cypher turns his head at the blast of heat and light for a full five seconds. The smoke clears and the heat slowly dies down, leaving nothing but a small pile of crumbling ash that soon dissolves into a fine mist. Another necessity of his work. The general population was for the most part unaware of the existence of such Cryptids.\n \nCypher returns back down the hallway, through the lobby and out into the now lessening storm. The previous smell of rot and decay, replaced by the crisp smell of wet birch foliage. Taking a deep pained breath of the icy air, Cypher slowly makes his way through the rain back to his car. His night was not yet over. The Order would need to be told. No doubt the Watchers would already be awaiting his return to the Grotto. The whole incident would then be covered up, no doubt under the guise of some form of animal attack or other such easy to digest story. Such was the way of the Order, secrecy and lies for the greater good. Turning the key, the engine fired to life and Cypher once again made his way through the darkness to the ancient Grotto of the Order. Sighing deeply, he chuckles, ‘all in a night’s work.’\n \n \n \n "},"544":{"title":"need help finding a creepypasta please!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fd1cmd\/need_help_finding_a_creepypasta_please\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"hugestinker","selftext":"i read this story years ago, but from what i remember, the title was either a timestamp or related to the concept of time. it was from the pov of a parent who’s child had passed away but then haunted him not long after, leading to the parent’s suicide. if anyone can help in any way its greatly appreciated!"},"545":{"title":"My neighbour keeps his windows shut throughout summer. I regret finding out why.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcvbp5\/my_neighbour_keeps_his_windows_shut_throughout\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Secret_Information88","selftext":"People always find it so funny that even though I've lived in the same place since I was born, thete are roads probably only a couple of hundred meters away from my house that I've never been down. That wouldn't be a big deal if I lived in London, but I'm from a tiny litttle town, really a village, where everyone knows each other. I won't say which one for obvious reasons, but it's in the English county of Surrey, and it's boring.\n\nI don't really know why I don't explore my own town much, but my mother thinks it's an aspie thing. I know where to go, and I just go there. Going to the park for a kickabout? Head left then go straight. Train station? Head left then take another left. School? That was Bus Stop B; head left and take a right. We weren't far from the epicentre of our town, if you could call it that, and as far as I was aware there was nothing on the other side apart from a few rows of semi-detached houses. Of course, that was before I met Luke.\n\nLuke moved over from North London three years ago, when we were both fifteen. His parents were one of so many couples who decided to move out of London during COVID. They moved in summer so Luke could settle in before starting sixth form, which if you're not from the UK is basically the last two years of school and the only bit that's optional.\n\nMe and my two mates, Tom and Liam, met Luke in the park on a swelteringly hot day, inviting him to join us for a kickabout that only lasted about twenty minutes before we surrendered to the heat and sat in the shade, pumping him with questions as rural kids inevitably will when encountering anyone new. He was a fun guy to be around, the kind of guy who would never take the piss out of you for no reason but would roast you back mercilessly if you tried to do the same. \n\nWe walked back to his parents' house with him and I found out that he was only a couple of roads away from me - we were neighbours. His road was quiet and peaceful, with nice cars on the driveways and slightly bigger houses than down our way. I didn't tell Luke that I'd never been down his road before. He had a PS5 and his parents were really nice, so we decided to stick around and texted our parents to say we'd be back late. We played FIFA for a while in a round robin, and when it wasn’t my turn I alternated between watching and looking out of the window.\n\nThe house directly opposite his caught my eye. It looked slightly older than his parents’ house, with fading brickwork,but that wasn’t what drew my attention to it. Even though it was still a while until sunset, someone was systematically closing every window on the front-facing side of the house. I saw the same arm, its owner obscured behind net curtains, reaching out to close each window before making a hand movement that  quickly interpreted as locking it. This strange little ceremony started in the living room, then progressed to the kitchen, then there was a pause - I interpreted this as the occupant going to the back windows to do the same - then it resumed upstairs. Before long, every window in the house was closed and locked, the curtains closed, and the house dead. After about twenty minutes, I saw a very faint glow coming from the living room windows. The occupant had turned the lights on.\n\nEverything about this felt wrong. For one, we were in the middle of a heatwave. For the last few nights, my room had transformed into a sweaty hotbox and I’d lay awake, uncomfortably melting. Not to mention that this was in the height of COVID, where people were keeping their windows open in the dead of winter let alone a boiling summer evening. I stared at the house for a few moments, wondering how stuffy and uncomfortable it must have been at the moment.\n\n“Luke,” I said, nudging him as he played. “Who lives across the road?”\n\n“Which one?” he asked, not turning around as he skillfully moved past the defence as Mbappe. “The one with the big oak tree outside or the one with the red curtains?”\n\n“Red curtains.”\n\n“Don’t know. Got a look at him once. Old guy. Beard. Keeps to himself.”\n\n“Does he always keep his windows closed? Curtains drawn?”\n\n“Yeah, does it every night,” he said, pausing the game and looking at me with that excited look people give you when you’ve noticed the same thing they have. Tom, who by all accounts was about to concede a goal as Juventus, gave a little ‘what the hell’ shrug. “I’ve watched him a couple of times.”\n\n“Must be boiling in there,” said Liam, his attention now drawn to the window. But he turned away. Liam never had a great attention span. I kept staring at the house. It had signs of life inside; after about twenty minutes, a faint light came on in the kitchen, then went off after a few minutes. I kept watching the house as the sun started to set, then my attention got diverted as Tom nudged me to tell me it was my turn.\n\nFor one reason or another, I find it very easy to get fixated on something and much harder to take my mind off it. I’ve got mild Aspergers and self-diagnosed OCD, so take your pick. From there on, whenever I went round to Luke’s house, sometimes with the others and sometimes alone, I’d stare at the house and watch the little pre-sunset ritual. It was clockwork; always around twenty five minutes before sunset, even as summer drew to a close and night fell earlier and earlier. Luke hadn’t taken as much of an interest in it, but he was polite enough to indulge mine. He’d seen the man a few times now, and told me that he got a food delivery every three weeks or so but that was the only time he saw him leave the house. One Saturday morning in September, I managed to get a look at this firsthand.\n\nThe delivery driver was waiting at least three or four minutes when the door opened. An older man, in his late seventies maybe, opened the door and walked straight out onto the threshold. He looked like he’d had a few hard years; his skin, even from across the road, looked rough and coarse. His hair was dirty grey and too long for a man his age, coming down to the nape of his neck. He had a thick, ragged beard of the same unsightly colour. He was wearing a vest that showed off a surprisingly wiry physique for a man of his age as well as some mildewy-looking pyjama bottoms.\n\nWhat really stood out about him, though, were his eyes. Even from my distant vantage point I could see that they had a burning energy about them, and the delivery driver - who’d no doubt been about to voice a complaint of being kept waiting for so long - visibly took a step back. The old man’s eyes never left the driver as he picked up the shopping, then promptly retreated inside, closing the door immediately behind him. The driver, taken aback, paused for a few moments and took off, heading out the gate much faster than he’d entered. \n\nAs the school year started and the seasons took a slow slide from summer, to autumn, then finally winter, my attention waned when it came to Luke’s strange neighbour. His window routine became just another thing happening in the background, just like everything else that could happen in a nothing town like ours. \n\nThat was until a month ago. \n\nLuke and I, now gangly eighteen year olds, had been at the pub celebrating our last exams. Our ‘A’ Levels (a major set of tests that happen at the end of the sixth form and basically determine which university you can get into). We’d gone back to his to have a few more beers and play some of his newer games. In the three years since the two of us had first met, Tom had moved away and Liam had fallen in with some of the rougher kids at school, thinking he was a roadman and giving us a wide berth. \n\nIt was getting late and I was thinking of going home. I had my phone resting on the windowsill and I grabbed it to check the time I saw a figure running full pelt down the road. It was the old man, moving with a speed I’d have barely thought credible, his movements seeming to match a younger man. He ran until he got to his house, slamming the gate behind him before unlocking the door in record speed and squeezing himself into it before closing up. I summoned Luke over silently and we watched the house for the next twenty minutes, neither of us saying a word, too gripped by fear to make a sound. A few lights went on in the surrounding houses, probably people woken up by the loud closing of the gate and the door, but the old man’s house stayed completely pitch black and silent.\n\n“What the fuck was that?” Luke said, breaking the deathly silence.\n\n“What was he running from?” I asked, knowing how freaked out my voice sounded.\n\n“There’s an Alsatian a few doors down,” he said, scanning the street. “Big beast. Bad temper.”\n\n“If you run from a dog, it’ll chase you,” I replied, my eyes fixed on the house opposite. Still no signs of life.\n\n“Liam?” he asked uncertainly.\n\n“He’s a little shit but he wouldn’t mug an old man.”\n\n“What about his mates though?”\n\n“I don’t think so.” My voice was tense, hollow. I had a horrible feeling on my mind. We sat there for half an hour, scanning the road. Then I headed back, looking up and down the street. An eerie silence fell over the whole place and I shivered in spite of the hot summer night. All the house lights were off now down the road, the occupants deciding to sleep now the commotion had passed. I got to my parents’ house and turned in, my sleep uneasy. \n\nI woke up around noon - hey, you did it too when you were on summer holidays - and headed downstairs, deciding that I had to tell my parents about this. Not for them to march over and get to the bottom of a situation, but because they were surprisingly good sounding boards whenever I had an obsession or neurosis bubble over. I once spent two weeks prodding and fretting over what I thought was a new dark mole on my shoulder, only for mum to tell me with an eyeroll that it was a birthmark. I saw her in the kitchen with Gary, our new neighbour, a meek looking man of around forty years old. \n\nGary was a boring guy, possibly on the low end of the spectrum like me, and hadn’t said much of a word to anyone since he’d moved in until my parents had sort of taken him under their wing. He wore what I’d already sussed was his favourite t-shirt, a faded dark AC\/DC shirt that had clearly once been black but was now a dull grey.\n\n“Morning, love,” said mum, sipping a milky cup of tea. “You get in late?”\n\n“Yeah, proper late,” I said, joining them. Normally I’d wait until Gary was gone, but he was nice enough and would probably be a fairly sensible sounding board. “Listen...I was at Luke’s house last night and I saw something weird.” I paused. “You know that house opposite him? Old man? Red curtains?”\n\n“Yeah,” Mum said, nodding. “I mean, I know the house. I’ve never met the owner.”\n\n“He has this…bizarre ritual before sunset. All the house windows get closed. Curtains drawn. Complete blackout.”\n\n“I think some old people do do that,” said Gary, mildly. “They treat it as a daily job, because otherwise they’ll forget. Probably leave a door open somewhere. Get burgled. Though, no way you’d catch me closing the windows around this time of year.”\n\n“It’s bloody hot,” said mum.\n\n“He did it in the height of COVID too,” I said.\n\n“He’s probably an eccentric,” said mum. “Or he gets cold.”\n\n“Last night I saw him,” I said, my voice dropping. “Running down the road like his fucking life depended on it. I couldn’t move that fast if I tried.”\n\n“Well, you do need some exercise,” mum said, flashing me a cheeky grin. “You don’t get anything from running in computers. You should get down the park. Play football or something.”\n\n“He wasn’t running to keep fit,” I replied. “He was being chased.”\n\n“Chased? Chased by who?”\n\n“I don’t know, I-” \n\nBut I stopped, something mum said having tripped something off in my brain. I forced an awkward smile and a shrug.\n\n“He probably was out jogging,” I said, trying to sound sincere. “One of my little...notions, I guess.”\n\nMum chuckled and patted my shoulder. “It happens, love. Do you want a cup of tea?”\n\n“Nah, I left my coursework at Luke’s last night,” I lied, getting up.\n\n“Thought you were done with all that?”\n\n“Yeah, but I want a copy in case they lose it. I’ll be back in a couple.” I gave her a kiss on the cheek then after a few paces turned back. “See ya, Gary,” I added, having forgotten he was there. They both waved me off and I headed right back to Luke’s, checking Google Maps on the way just to check a hunch from what I could see of the space past the old man’s house. Luke, who was still half asleep by the look of things, didn’t seem like he’d slept great either.\n\n“You okay mate?” he said when I knocked on his bedroom door. “You forget something?”\n\n“Have you got an old football somewhere?” I asked, cutting him off quickly.\n\n“Uh, probably,” he said, puzzled. “Maybe in the shed?”\n\nWe headed into his back garden to grab an old football that was tucked neatly under two cobwebby boxes of bric a brac. Luke didn’t ask any questions as I took it and we headed out onto the road. We walked down the road and took a sharp right. Mine being a small town, many of the houses didn’t back onto anything other than road or open spaces. The side road was bordered by fences on all side and we quickly identified the old man’s house from the rolled red curtains. I looked up at it. I couldn’t see the garden through the fence but I could see the back of the house. The brickwork here was even more decrepit and there was ivy that looked overgrown. \n\nI placed the ball gently on the ground and chipped it over the fence, hearing it land in the neighbour’s garden with a very soft thud. Luke gave a groan in protest but cut it off, realising the game plan. I raced back round to the front of the house and knocked on the door, hearing the sound reverberate inside.\n\nThere was nothing for a few minutes. Then I heard a strange sound that I immediately recognised as latches or locks - at least five or six of them - being unlocked. Then the door swung open and I was greeted with the face that I remembered so well. His eyes blazed harder than usual, no doubt because I was an unscheduled visitor.\n\n“What?” He demanded coarsely. His accent was pure old-school East London, the kind of guttural rasp that was the staple of British gangster films. He didn’t take his eyes off me for a second.\n\n“Hey,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant. “Sorry, me and my mate were kicking a ball around and I think it went in your back garden. Have you seen it?”\n\n“No. Fuck off.” He was every bit the charmer I imagined him to be.\n\n“Do you mind if I come over and grab it? I’ll be out of your hair in two minutes-”\n\n“You’re not coming through this house,” he said as if I’d mortally offended him. His face was full of indignant rage, but within a second it changed, and a sort of strange realisation came over his hawkish features.\n\n“What do you want?” He asked, putting an insane emphasis on the ‘you’.\n\n“I told you, my ball-”\n\n“Don’t act bloody stupid with me!” he roared. “It’s you. You’re always watching my house.”\n\nA chill went down my neck. Of all the times I’d stared at the place, I never considered the idea that its owner was staring back at me.\n\n“Not…uh, not for a while,” I said, trying to find my words.\n\n“Yeah, but you’re here now, aren’t you?” He asked, nastily.\n\n“It’s just…I saw you last night,” I said, a tiny bit of confidence creeping into my voice. “You looked scared.”\n\nHe paused for a moment. “You see a lot, dontcha? I see a lot too.” Another pause. “Right, normally I’d tell you if you so much as look at my house again I’ll kill you. But there’s a situation. And I need eyes.”\n\nHe gestured for me to come in. I looked back at Luke, who was standing about fifty steps back, giving a quick shake of my hand to tell him not to worry. Once I was in, he started the complex process of locking the deadbolts on his front door. I’d counted wrong - he had eight.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about his cramped hallway was the humidity. It hit me as soon as the door closed, stifling and unpleasant. The next thing I noticed were the wooden crosses - there were six of them lining each side of the hallway, each of them identical in design and each looking like they’d been made in a garden shed on a boring afternoon. Most religious folk, my parents included, had a crucifix somewhere within easy viewing, but to have six in such rigid formation was a strange sight.\n\nHe directed me into the living room, and the crosses became normal by comparison. Every inch of the room, including every patch of wall and most of the hardwood floor, was wallpapered by yellowed newspaper articles. This wasn’t some artsy custom design - it was strikingly clear that every single one of them had been hand stuck. Some looked like major newspapers - all the physical paper, no printouts of online articles - but some were local papers, including one that was published right here in town. The headlines tended towards the morbid, and had a strange focus on missing persons article. Hikers going off on solo trails and not coming back. Kids snatched in the dead of night. I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. This didn’t feel like some armchair detective, it felt more like a serial killer keeping the reporting of his work like some trophy.\n\nThe rest of the room was just as humid as the hall and decrepit, with a sofa that looked like it survived the Blitz and an armchair with probably more mildew stuffed inside its fibers than my whole house combined. The old man directed me to the armchair and I sat down, fear making my heart pound, wondering whether I should make a run for it and try to throw open the deadbolts before he charged out to grab me.\n\n“I grew up in Mile End,” he said gruffly, sitting down on the sofa. “Old terraced council house in one of the roughest roads in the area. People going missing or ending up dead over some small feud or winding up the wrong person. Whole families packing up without a by-your-leave. It’s the exact kind of place where people can disappear. It’s the kind of place they thrive.”\n\n“They? Who are they?”\n\n“If I say it, you’ll think I’m mad,” he said, and I repressed the chuckle that had been rising. “You’re a bright kid.You like to observe just like I used to. So you tell me.”\n\nI thought about everything so far. Why he’d reacted so poorly to me asking to come in. The deadbolts. The crosses on the wall.\n\n“If they existed, I’d say it was vampires,” I said, unable to suppress the laugh that came with my words. He stared me dead in the face, those burning eyes not wavering for a second. “But come on,” I continued, “you’re not telling me that you close all your windows every night because of Count Dracula?”\n\nHe laughed too, a rasping giggle completely devoid of mirth or warmth. “Count fucking Dracula,” he said. “Is that what you think a vampire is, some suave aristo in a cape?” He reached for something on the cluttered coffee table and thrust it into my hand. It was a polaroid. I turned it over to reveal the photo - and my veins pumped with ice. My hand started to shake so badly I almost dropped the photo, and my heart pounded with pure, unrelenting fear.\n\n“This is…this is AI,” said a voice that sounded like mine.\n\n“It’s a twenty year old polaroid. I thought you were observant.”\n\n“But you must have. It’s not…it’s not possible…what the FUCK is that?”\n\nMy hands still shaking, I raised the photo up and forced myself to study it in more detail. It showed someone that might have once been a man, but whose features were warped beyond all measure. His eyes were the first terrible detail that I noticed. They were jet black, but they weren’t smooth like a demon in a Shyamalan; they were bulbous and fleshy, and seemed to bulge outwards.\n\n“Those are its pupils,” said the old man. “When the hunger gets to them, the pupils swell up and expand over its eyes like a massive, fleshy stye. But it’s not blinded. Not by a long shot.”\n\nNausea rose up in my throat to join the thick cloud of fear that already dwelt there. “Does it…hurt him?”\n\n“It. And worse than anything you could imagine.”\n\nI next looked to the creature’s mouth and the urge to throw up intensified. Lining the creature’s mouth were strange needles that protruded horribly from what were otherwise human teeth, thinner than a syringe. But like a syringe that you’ve accidentally dropped needle-first on the floor, every single one of them was bent and twisted horribly.\n\n“Those are how it feeds,” he continued, seeing my eyeline move down. “Same time as the pupils swell up, these things slide out of the teeth. They start straight. Then a few bites down, they start to catch and bend.”\n\nThe rest of the creature’s features were relatively unremarkable. It was pale, but not insanely so, and its head had mats of lanky black hair. I feel like every second I stared at the photo brought me closer to panic, but I forced myself to put it down and engage my brain.\n\n“There’s no way this thing exists,” I said, more to myself than the old man. “It would be on the internet within days. And even if all this goes away after it’s fed, there’s no way this sort of…monstrosity could go back to looking like a human.”\n\n“You’d be surprised,” he said. “I’ve got loads of photos of vampires in their normal form, but only a few in this state. Lucky for me, that whole thing about photos and reflections isn’t true. The only thing that marks them out is their eyes - after a couple of years, all that trauma scratches their iris until it’s more or less blood red. So what do they do?”\n\n“They wear contacts?” I said, the levity of the joke dying in my mouth.\n\n“Exactly,” he said. “It’s the only thing that works. From everything I’ve seen, before contact lenses - and sunglasses, but those always attract attention when worn at night - one of the hardest parts of a vampire’s life was hiding their eyes. It’s why they’re so much bolder than they used to be. And why they hide in plain sight instead of lurking in damp caves.”\n\n“What do you mean hide in plain sight?”\n\n“It’s the way for them now. They move around under different identities. Blend in. People invite them in, make them a cup of tea, then come back when you’re asleep. Or if they can’t get invited, they try to…rig the game with loopholes. Anything that could count as an invitation. An open window.”\n\nA realisation hit me like an electric shock. “That’s why you-”\n\n“-Yeah. Back when I was a kid, my sister, she was…well, she was ill. Not the type of ill you recover from. She was hot all the time. She’d sleep with her window wide open in the dead of winter just to cool down. Then one night…one took her.”\n\n“I’m so sorry. How…” I paused. “How did you know it was a vampire?”\n\n“I killed it,” he said. “Tracked it down and killed it. It was weak. My sister’s illness had done that when he’d drained her dry.”\n\nI had about fifty questions rising to the surface, each resting on the lunatic presumption that what he was telling me was fact. Eventually I narrowed it down to one that had burned on my brain since I’d walked in.\n\n“You said there was a situation,” I said finally.\n\n“You could say that. One of them’s here.”\n\nAlthough the rational part of my brain still rejected everything he had to say as nonsense, I still felt an intense pang of fear grip me. “Here? In town?”\n\n“Right here. It hasn’t struck yet. It always waits a little while before starting its nasty work. If people go missing as soon as it moves to town, there’s questions asked.”\n\n“So how do you know one’s here?”\n\nHe reached for a freezer bag on the floor nearby and handed it to me. For a second I couldn’t understand what I was seeing, then my brain processed it and I let out a horrified, nauseated groan. The bag was full of contact lenses, each of them caked in blood. I dropped it on the floor, telling myself I’d use a bucket of hand sanitiser once I got out.\n\n“Only early warning sign you get,” he said. “Right now it’s hungry. It’s getting pangs - and transformations - most nights. It stalks the night looking for easy opportunities, and as it gets hungrier, it has to keep going through these in case it’s spotted.” He gave an unpleasant grimace, no doubt imagining with horror the scene of a vampire shedding contact lenses like snakes shed their skin - just like I was. “I know you think it’s bullshit, but I want you to do something for me,” he continued. “Watch.”\n\n“Watch?” I repeated, puzzled.\n\n“Yeah. Just like you watched my house, watched me, apply that to your road. Whenever you’re about to go to bed, just watch your street for, I don’t know, ten minutes or so. Vampires move around a lot. They’ll comb a whole town in a night looking for an opportunity to feed quietly, or to scope out future victims.”\n\nThere wasn’t much to say after that, so I headed off, telling the full story to Luke who’d clearly been on the verge of dialling 999. I raced home, mum not saying much when I washed my hands for five minutes straight. She probably wrote it off as a random OCD moment. I spent the rest of that day doing some pre-uni reading then played on the PS4 until around midnight. Then, scolding myself for giving fantasy even a moment of my time, I went and sat in front of my window, gently prising the net curtains to one side. \n\nI didn’t stay there for long. It was twenty minutes at the most. My bedroom window directly overlooked the road and I got a good look at whoever was coming and going. No one did; my town shuts down long before midnight. It wasn’t until I was completely convinced that there was nothing or no one passing through that night that I folded the net curtains back over and went to bed.\n\nI don’t exactly know why I did it, but I returned to that spot at around the same time the next night, and the next night after that. Soon I’d been doing it as a strange little habit for a little over three weeks, always starting at the same time and finishing at more or less the same. When I finished, I felt like a night watchman who’d done his duty and was off-shift. \n\nI never saw anything, of course. Well, nothing sinister. I saw foxes, and the occasional neighbour going out to do the bins. But despite staring out into that empty darkness night after night and almost hoping I’d see something out of place, I never did.\n\nUntil two nights ago. \n\nIt was just when I was first starting to think about turning in. I’d woken up early the night before, having nightmares of strange, black-eyed figures gathered on the road in dark hoods, and I was tired. I gave a long scan of the view outside my window and this time saw a lone figure walking on the other side. It wasn’t his gait, which was slightly unusual in a week, shuffling way, that instantly unnerved me. It was the fact that he bent over and clutched his head with his hands. This wasn’t a drunk stumbling home and regretting life choices. This was a person in terrible pain. He - it was a he, though I couldn’t make much out of him in the pitch black - did not scream or wail but the way his whole body shook told me that this was a man in silent agony. After a few terrible moments, he was done - and dropped something on the floor with disregard.\n\nI sat there watching in stunned silence as the figure resumed its awkward stride. I felt a loud, rhythmic thudding and I realised it was my heart pounding. Once he was out of my eyeline I crept downstairs, my parents both being sound asleep. I opened the front door as delicately as I could, taking pains not to close it hard before I made my slow way across the road, checking the coast was clear of the figure before I got to the other side. \n\nHe’d dropped a bloody contact lens.\n\nEvery rational part of myself scrambled for reasons and justifications, but they were all silenced in an instant. I could feel myself hyperventilate and shake as I stared down at that loathsome object, willing myself to shine a light on it so I could confirm it was some innocuous debris that just looked like a bloody contact lens. But I didn’t. Instead, I took off in the direction of the figure, forcing my legs - which felt like jelly - to move. I got to a three-way turn at the end of my road and panicked slightly, wondering if I’d lost the strange figure. But a small movement in the corner of my eye on the left kept me focused, and I pursued the figure quietly as it made its way down the road.\nAs I continued, I saw where the figure had decided to head. At the end of the road there were two massive oak trees and between them was a footpath leading to a rickety turnstyle. Beyond the turnstyle was open woods, an easy place to disappear especially after dark, and I wouldn’t have followed them into those woods if my life depended on it.\n\nI crouched by one of the trees as I saw the figure approaching the turnstyle. Most of its features were obscured in darkness, but I got a chill as I saw the way it mounted the turnstyle. It did so in a way that was equivalent to hauling its limbs at great effort onto the decrepit structure. As it swung a leg over the gap, I waited for it to haul the other one over and make the crossing.\n\nBut it didn’t.\n\nIt stopped midway, stood statue-still atop the turnstyle for a few seconds. It seemed to be scanning its surroundings, and I heard what sounded like a loud, distinctive sniff. Then it turned its head in my direction.\n\nMy heart thumping like an intense bass coming from a car’s subwoofer, I shifted my head slightly, concealing myself from view behind the tree, trying to still get a view of the figure through a small gap in the tree. I couldn’t see much. Terror gripped every single string of muscle in my body and I fought the urge to start running.\n\nThe figure dismounted the turnstyle and walked a few awkward steps back down the footpath. I couldn’t bear to move a muscle. It stopped around five metres from me and stood deathly still, then I heard another terrible sniff. I tried to see the creature’s face, and while it was too dark to make its features out, I knew it would have looked like the polaroid I’d seen.\n\nAfter a terrible few moments, the creature turned on its heel and went back to the turnstyle. I stayed completely still as it crossed into the woods and disappeared from sight, then stayed in that position for at least ten more minutes, convinced that if I moved so much as a muscle that unknown horror’s head would reappear from the side of the turnstyle and those horrific needle teeth would clamp around my neck as I screamed in agony.\n\nOnce I was convinced that the vampire wasn’t coming back, I shakily forced myself up and made my way home. It wasn’t until I was at the end of the road that my knees buckled in terror, forcing me to grab onto a brick wall, as something clicked for me that hadn’t at first. It’s the same thing that gives me uncontrollable shakes even when writing this a day later.\n\nIt was the realisation that, while the creature’s face had been in complete darkness, I actually got a slight look at his clothes, and more specifically, his top half.\n\nHe was wearing an AC\/DC t-shirt.\n"},"546":{"title":"Need help finding an old and obscure story ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fd6w1m\/need_help_finding_an_old_and_obscure_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Flashy-Suggestion-14","selftext":"This would have been maybe 15\/17 years ago, I think it had already come out in its entirety by the time I found it so it could be older then that.

My parents owned a small restaurant, and we lived in a modest back room where we all slept together in one bed—my parents, my sister, and me.\n\nOne night, I woke up needing to use the restroom. As I groggily rubbed my eyes, something caught my attention in the corner of the room. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, so I blinked hard, trying to clear the crust from my eyes. But when I looked again, I saw it clearly—a figure, crouched and staring at me from the shadows.\n\nPanic surged through me. I wanted to run back to the safety of the bed, but I couldn’t move. My body was frozen in place, paralyzed by fear. The figure, which looked almost human, began to rise and walk toward me. Each step it took sent a wave of terror through my body, but still, I couldn’t move.\n\nAs it drew closer, I finally managed to break free from my fear. I lunged onto the bed, frantically trying to wake my family, but they wouldn’t budge. It was as if they were in a deep, unnatural sleep. Desperate, I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping it would all go away.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I found myself sitting on the edge of the bed. My mother was awake, standing next to me, staring at the humanoid figure. They didn’t speak, just looked at each other in silence. Gathering all my courage, I got up and walked around the thing. I reached out and pushed it—it felt slick, almost slimy but not wet, like its skin or clothes were coated in something. Its skin was a sickly gray, but no matter how hard I tried, I could never remember its face.\n\nAfter I pushed it, my mother finally spoke. She simply said, \"He won’t bother you again.\" And just like that, the figure was gone.

(continuation)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fchmnm\/what_the_hell_was_following_me_continuation\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BETTA-system","selftext":"I didn’t sleep at all that night.   \nHow the hell could I? I kept replaying it in my mind, trying to rationalize what I saw, or didn’t see. But nothing made sense. I couldn't go back out, not yet. I tried calling off work, told them I wasn’t feeling well, threw in some half-assed excuse about a fever or whatever. I just wasn’t ready to face the world. I was on edge, paranoid as hell. I didn’t have any friends nearby either, which made things worse. I’d just moved to this city a few months ago, snagged this cheap-ass two-story house on the outskirts. It seemed like a dream at first. A quiet place, a little out of the city but not too far. No one around for miles. It was peaceful - during the day, at least. The night turned this place into something else, especially after... that.  \nHonestly, the location was what sold me. It’s the kind of place that would’ve cost twice as much closer to the city. But now? Now I felt trapped. I couldn’t just pack up and leave. Every hotel nearby was miles away, and I wasn’t about to drain my bank account just for a few nights of temporary peace. What good would that do, anyway?\n\nI started pacing, thinking of how to fix this, how to feel secure again. I knew I couldn’t stay like this - constantly on edge, waiting for something to happen. So I decided to do something about it. First step: cameras. i need all the information I can have. I figured if I could see whatever the hell was out there, I’d feel a little better. I drove out to the nearest tech store and grabbed three infrared security cameras. Two for the inside, one for the outside. If something was lurking around, I wanted to see it. After that, I stopped by the hardware store to buy some extra locks, maybe reinforce the windows. This place was old, after all. The doors were barely 3cm thick, and the windows? Don’t even get me started.   \nSetting up the cameras and fortifying the house took the whole damn day. By the time I was done, it was dark again. I made sure everything was secure - double-checked the locks, windows, even put a chair under the door handle like some cheap horror movie.\n\nThen I holed up in my bedroom, staring at the monitor I hooked up to the cameras. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. I had snacks, energy drinks, anything to keep me awake. But nothing happened. The whole night, it was just… nothing. No movement, no shadows, no weird noises. It was almost disappointing, in a weird way. I didn’t sleep until the sun started creeping through the windows.  \nWhen I finally crashed and woke up the next afternoon, everything was normal. I checked the cameras again - clean recordings, not a single thing caught on them. Hell, I didn’t even see the stray cats that usually lurk around. I started to wonder if maybe I’d lost it last night. I mean, lack of sleep can mess with your head, right? Maybe I was just so freaked out I imagined the whole thing.   \n  \nI've gotten a call from my supervisor shortly after, I had to go back to work. They didn’t have anyone to cover my shift, and I couldn’t keep calling in sick. Plus, by that point, I’d convinced myself nothing was really wrong. It was just one weird night. I’d be fine. By the time I left for work, it had started raining. Great. I grabbed an umbrella and headed out. The wind was brutal, especially through the narrow alleys I usually cut through. It was the kind of wind that could rip your umbrella right out of your hands - and it did. Mine got snatched away, tangled up in some tree branches. Now I was soaked, pissed off, and just waiting for the day to get worse.  \nWhen I got to work, I asked one of my coworkers about the guy who usually worked the night shift with me. He hadn’t shown up. Apparently, he’d been feeling off, said he was dealing with some mental health stuff and had called in sick the day before too. Weird, but I shrugged it off. People have bad days. Still, it felt odd that he’d just disappear like that. The shift dragged on. Nobody came in, no deliveries, nothing. Just the rain pounding against the windows, drowning out my thoughts for hours.\n\nEventually, my shift ended, and I was dreading the walk home. It was raining harder than before, and I knew I’d have to cut through that same dark stretch of muddy road again. I tried to stay close to the streetlights, but once I hit that muddy section, it was like deja vu of that night. Feeling weird, paying more attention to everything. The mud gets really sticky - leaves faint footprints behind whenever I walk on this road in the rain, and normally, it wouldn’t have bothered me. But then I noticed something... there were barefoot footprints beside mine.\n\nAt first, I thought maybe it was just someone walking their dog or something, but the more I looked, the weirder it got. These weren’t normal footprints. Whoever made them was walking on their toes. My heart sank when I reached the corner. The path those footprints followed was the same one I took when I went to retrieve my umbrella earlier. Exactly the fucking same.\n\nIt was following me. Right behind me the whole time.   \nI spun around, shining the flashlight into the dark. Nothing. Just rain and the sound of my own breathing. My pulse was pounding in my ears. I ran. I didn’t care about the mud, the rain, none of it. I just needed to get the hell out of there.  \n  \nWhen I finally made it home, I saw those same footprints leading up to my front door. I wanted to run, to keep going, but where the hell was I supposed to go? The dark, the rain, the empty streets - it was all worse than what was inside.  \nI sprinted inside, slamming the door behind me, locking it, and racing up to my room. My heart was in my throat. I locked myself in with my computer and frantically pulled up the camera feed.  \nThe outside camera? Nothing. It wasn’t even recording properly. It had frozen on a single frame. That’s why I hadn’t seen anything weird the day before. It hadn’t been recording shit.  \nThe inside cameras were the same. Frozen. No idea how long it had been like that. No idea if whatever had been following me was at some point in my house...   \nIf it is right now.\n\nI reset everything, and finally, the cameras started displaying actual live feed. The outside camera was useless. Just static of the rain, just white noise flooding the screen. The inside camera on the bottom floor showed nothing. All doors and windows were still secured. I hesitated before I checked the one on the top floor where I was...  \n\n\nIt is waiting for me to unlock the door."},"554":{"title":"Hello From an Old Friend: Part II","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcxq3e\/hello_from_an_old_friend_part_ii\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"LionFalse4295","selftext":"April 14th 2010\n\nHello, my name is Sam. I don't usually post a lot on Reddit, but something happened 2 days ago that was just so... scary and odd that I just had to share. For some context, I'm a 22 yr girl who lives in Missouri. I've lived here pretty much all my life, and I've never really thought about moving, at least until now.... I live alone with my two cats, Daisy and Moose. \n\nRecently, about a week and a half ago, my parents asked me to watch over their house while they were gone on vacation. I said yes and they gave me all the instructions and told me I could stay there until they got back. It seemed like my own personal vacation, getting to hang out at my parent's home and just enjoy the week. They also told me that I could bring Daisy and Moose over if I wanted (which I did). Anyways, I drove over there and said goodbye before going inside and hanging out. \n\nI watched some TV and also played with Daisy a little bit (I played with Moose a little bit aswell, but not as much since he just likes to lay around and be lazy), and i also surfed the web a little with my laptop. I brought it with me just in case i wanted to talk with a few friends in some chatrooms or just look for some cool sites. Now, this is important, since it's part of my little experience.\n\nSo, now that you know the layout of things, i'll get to the weird parts. On the second day of me watching the house, i was eating lunch and just looking at some stuff on my laptop. Suddenly, i got a notification, it came from one of the chatrooms. I opened the chat and realised it came from one of my friends \"HelloFri3nd\". He is someone i friended about a month ago i believe. We've talked about three times every week, mostly about life and childhood memories. He doesn't have the best grammar, but he's quite nice and fun to talk to. Anyways, i noticed that he said hello to me. I messaged him back and we talked back and forth for a little bit. We pretty much just talked about memes and pets. We did this for about 20 minutes until weird things began happening.\n\nThe lights started to flicker slightly. I didn't think much of it at first, but it kept going on and on for about 7 minutes. Weirdest thing is, the flickering would progess and get faster and faster and then it would die down suddenly. I was confused but it just seemed like maybe a tree was hitting a powerline or something. I let HelloFri3nd know just in case i lost connection, but the flickering stopped. I shrugged it off and continued talking to him until i decided to say bye and play with my cats. For some reason, he really really didn't wanna say bye. He kept trying to make excuses for me to stay and talk but i just told him i had to go do something. I don't like lying, but i really wanted to spend some time with my cats.\n\nThe next day, he kept messaging me. I didn't really feel like talking at that time, but i decided to give in and talk a little. We talked about some of our favorite shows, mine being Royal Pains, and his being Blade. Everything was going smoothly at first, but then something very strange and quite frankly creepy happened. I looked away from the message bar for a minute to make sure one of the cats weren't getting into trouble, and when i turned my head to look back at the screen, i swear for a split second i saw HelloFri3nd say something along the lines of \"in your mind\". I was confused at first, because when my eyes finally met the screen, he didn't say anything like that. It took me a moment to register it, but i took it as me hallucinating, because a few weeks prior, i had a few episodes of hallucinations while talking to HelloFri3nd. I would see things like shadows moving across my walls or people who weren't there. I've been taking medication for it, but it barely seems to help. \n\nAnyways, after that, i didn't talk to HelloFri3nd for about 6 days. Odd thing is, i didn't have another hallucination for those 6 days. Everything was normal...Until it wasn't. The next day, at around 8:50 i think, i was using my parent's washer. Daisy was being her cute little ladylike self, and i was petting her. Suddenly i heard a notification ping coming from the living room. I finish up loading the laundry, and i walk into the living room to see what it is. I sat on the couch and opened my laptop and went over to my chatrooms. \n\nIt was HelloFri3nd. I opened up my chat with him and saw that he was saying hello again. I didn't feel like talking again, and i was about to give an excuse not to talk but he sent me another message. He apologised for not talking to me in a bit, and he said that he was free to talk. I felt kinda bad, since he was a very nice guy. I contemplated on what to do, and i guess i let my kind heart guide the way, because i decided to talk to him a little bit. I don't wanna bore you with the details about what we were talking about, so i'll just get straight to the disturbing part. \n\nSo, the lights started flickering again. One by one, every lamp, every bulb, and every single light source flickered out of sync. It was annoying at first, but it then became slightly creepy because it was dark out and everything was silent. I patted the couch seat next to me and called Moose over to sit with me. He complied and laid down next to me and let me pet him while i talked to HelloFri3nd. The light flickering stopped for a few minutes, and i sighed in relief. Me and HelloFri3nd talked for about... 3 minutes until i decided to wash my hair in the bathroom real quick since it felt kinda greasy. \n\nI washed my hair thoroughly for a few minutes and finally dried my hair. I then put the towel down and looked at myself in the mirror, before noticing something terrifying. Out of the mirror's reflection, i could see what looked to be the shadowy silhouette of a person under the dining table in the dining room. I swear i could literally see the moment my blood ran cold in the mirror. I screamed the loudest i've ever screamed before turning to look at the table. As soon as i did, the figure vanished. I backed up slowly and i could feel my hands violently shaking. I felt like i would pass out at any moment, but i kept myself together. I carefully walked out of the bathroom and sat down on the couch. I tried to calm myself down, as i thought it was another hallucination. I quickly pulled some blankets over me and laid down with a pillow against my back to hold myself up. I shakily took the laptop and set it in my lap. \n\nI knew my hallucinations could get spooky, but that was a scare that i swore could've actually given me a heart attack. I then talked to HelloFri3nd for a little bit longer and then passed out on the couch.\n\nNow, i'm going to tell you about the scariest part. This is the main part that i really want to get off my chest because it was so horrifying. So, the next night, i was watching a movie after taking a shower. I can't remember the exact time, but it was quite late. I was watching The Day the Earth Stood Still, and i had both cats beside me. About 40 minutes into the movie, i got a new notification on my laptop. I paused the move to check it, and low and behold it was HelloFri3nd. I really didn't wanna talk this time since i didn't want any interruptions with my movie. I opened up my chat with him, and i was about to tell him i was busy, when he messaged me again. He told me that he really needed to talk with me cause he was feeling down. I was going to fight against my kind heart, but it overpowered me and i decided to give him some of my time. I asked him what was wrong and he said he was just feeling sad because he was lonely. I then told him i'm always available to help a friend and he thanked me. We talked for about 5 minutes until things went downhill. \n\nI was about to type something when suddenly the lights started flickering again. This time, they were flickering much faster. I sighed in annoyance and i was about to get up to check the circuit breaker when the TV started acting up aswell. It would jump from scene to scene in the movie very rapidly, then it began to quickly surf across channels. I was confused and i tried to get up to see what was going on, but i felt stuck to the couch. Suddenly, the TV then went to static, making that loud white noise sound. \n\nI quickly covered one of my ears and reached for the remote, trying to turn the stupid thing off. I pressed the power button as hard as i could and i wouldn't stop pressing it over and over but nothing worked. I kept trying and trying but it was useless. I tried to get off the couch again, and finally i managed to get up. I walked over to the TV and ripped the power plug out. The TV finally shut off, and everything was peaceful again. Well... Atleast i thought. The lights flickered faster and faster, and i was starting to get really annoyed. \n\nI was heading for the circuit breaker when i felt a sudden urge to look back at my laptop. The laptop was the last thing i was focused on, but i gave in to the feeling. My eyes met the screen, and i saw a weird eerie warning message. It said \"you are not alone friend\". It spooked me for a second and left me confused. It was an error warning, but instead of it saying something like \"ERROR 404\" or anything like that, it was just replaced by those creepy words. \n\nI turned my whole body to face the laptop and I just stared at it in pure confusion and slight fear. I don't really know what it was about, but it certainly humbled me. I fought against the strange feeling to stare at the screen, and I walked into the circuit breaker room. I then opened the panel and I flipped the power switch to turn the power off to maybe reset it. I kept it off for about 8 seconds before flipping the switch to turn it on again. It didn't turn back on for about 3 seconds before it flashed on and every light began to flicker again. This time, more rapidly and aggressively. I groaned in annoyance and I tried again to reset the power. I shut it off for 15 seconds this time, and then turned it back on, but then it happened again. I stomped into the living room and I was about to sit down, when I noticed something. I saw shadows slowly moving across the cieling. I didn't know what it was at first, but then I looked at the window and saw the source. A big shadowy figure was walking outside, and it looked to be heading for the front door. I froze in terror, and i just stared at it. I thought it was one of my hallucinations, but that theory was quickly dismantled as I heard a thump against the door. \n\nI quickly snapped out of my staring fest, and I grabbed Moose and Daisy before bolting for my parent's room. I ran inside, and slammed the door before locking it. I desperately looked for a place to hide, but it was difficult. I didn't wanna hide under the bed, because everyone checks under the bed. My best bet was the closet. I really didn't wanna hide in the closet, but it was my only hope. I sprinted into the closet with both cats in each arm, and shut the doors. I then put Moose down on the closet floor and reached into my pocket before grabbing my phone to call 911.\n\nJust as I was about to dial the last digit, I heard something that made my heart skip a beat. I heard the sound of the front door creaking open. I almost let out a whimper of fear, but I dropped my phone and covered my mouth. I slowly leaned my back against the wall of the closet and silently cried to myself. I couldn't hear anything else after that. It was all quiet, too quiet. Not a single molecule made a noise.\n\nA few seconds later, I slowly took my hand off my mouth, and picked up my phone. I finally managed to call 911 and I told them about what happened. They asked me where I lived, and I told them. They told me to remain calm, and stay hidden as they sent a few officers to my location. I did as they said, and stayed on the phone as I stayed hidden. It was still quiet outside the closet, and not much else was happening except for the flickering of the lights. Suddenly though, I heard a weird sound. It was all around my house. It sounded like a weird wooshing sound or breathing sound.\n\nI don't really know how to explain it, but the best way I could, is by saying that it sounded like an audio recording of space. It was eerie, but it might have just been the wind. After a few minutes of hiding, I felt something. It was that same urge to look at the laptop screen, at HelloFri3nd's messages. I tried with all my willpower to fight against the feeling and obey the orders of the 911 operator, but the feeling was too strong. I slowly got up and opened the closet door before walking out and heading for the living room. I really really didn't wanna go out there, but I couldn't fight the weird urge. I finally made it to the living room, and I looked at the screen. It was just the messages between me and HelloFri3nd. I really wanted to look away and run back to the closet, but it felt like I couldn't. Suddenly, the screen started glitching. It flickered and a bunch of errors started popping up everywhere. \n\nI was confused and didn't understand what was going on. The screen just keep displaying error after error. Suddenly, I heard a thud coming from the laundry room to my right. I flinched and quickly snapped out of my staring before running back to my parent's bedroom. As I sprinted towards the doorway, I could hear loud footsteps from behind me. Someone was chasing me. I hastily made it back to the bedroom and slammed the door in a panic before locking it. I then ran over to the closet and shut the door.\n\nI know what I did was incredibly dumb, but I swear that I literally couldn't fight the urge to just look at the laptop screen. Anyways, i scooted deep into the back of the closet and picked up my phone. I quietly asked the operator when the police would arrive, and she said they were almost at my house. I was relieved but still tense. Suddenly, I heard loud banging against the door to the bedroom. I flinched and tried to stay as quiet as possible. The loud banging sounds kept getting louder and louder and more forceful, and I swear it looked like the flickering of the lights intensified. I put the phone down again, and covered my mouth because I started hyperventilating out of fear. \n\nThe loud banging and slamming got worse and worse and it sounded like maybe the door would come off its hinges. I looked down and noticed that the cats were getting scared too. I shakily petted them with my free hand and I could feel how scared they were judging by their quivering bodies. Suddenly, I heard the door bust open. At this moment, I thought that it was all over. I felt like my world was ending. I slowly and carefully slid further and further down the wall and then just laid there with the cats. I silently cried and tried with all my life force to stop my hyperventilating, but it was useless. I then heard another weird sound. It was like a rumbling ambience all around the house. I took this as my signal that I was done for, and braced myself. \n\nSuddenly, I heard a police siren blaring through my neighborhood and it was getting closer and closer. The rumbling sound then suddenly stopped as the flashing red and blue lights began to shine through the bedroom window. I felt a huge rush of relief and hope wash over me, like a huge boulder had been lifted off of me. I cried the hardest I've ever cried and I just laid there. \n\nAfter all of that, i went out with the police and they investigated my parent's home. They didn't find anything out of the ordinary, or anything tampered with. Just a few opened doors that weren't open before. I called my parents and told them everything, and they panicked and decided to rush home and cut their trip short. \n\nMy parents are now safe at their house, and I'm safe at mine with the kitties. My parents seem to think that maybe it was my hallucinations, but there's no way it was. Someone definitely broke into their house. I tried to tell them, but the only evidence I had were a few of the opened doors that I definitely didn't open. \n\nNow that it's all off my chest, what do I do now? Do I continue to try and convince them that someone broke in, or do I just give it up and blame it on my hallucinations? I'm really torn on what I need to do. \n\nI'm now going to go talk to HelloFri3nd now and ask for his input too. See you guys later."},"555":{"title":"DNA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcm24e\/dna\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Suv006","selftext":"30 years into my career, I interrogated many murders and serial killer but i can't forget that one person whom I interrogated during my rookie year. All the memories from that incident flooded my brain when I heard he died.\n\nDuring my second year into the job,  I was summoned to assist senior in that case. It was typical case of cannibal serial killer. From what  I heard from others he was suffering from schizophrenia. During the interrogation he started to confess everything. He described how he murdered his victims. He used to call humans as  ingredients, he used to cook and eat them. It was hard to listen to his steps. \n\nFirst he used to find someone chubby and would stalk them for days and week. After that he used to attack and kill them at night. He had three large fridge at his apartment and one of the fridge was dedicated to the victims who were very tasty, he used to their head as token. One thing which wasn't sitting right to us was that he kept on mentioning his friend Alice. He said that they both were involved in  the so called ingredients hunting. He explained how he killed her due to disagreement. He said that he cooked her and ate her and kept her head as token.\n\n# But on the night he was caught at his apartment. His friend whom he killed was there sitting at dining table full with cooked foods. He was scared, so he ran toward the fridge to check her head but it was there. He then took knife and stab her multiple times. Even after that she stood up and wished him farewell and disappeared. \n\n.He wanted us to find her, during the arrest police did found puddle of blood near the dining table. They examined every single victims identity and strange thing was that there was a DNA of a person name Alice who died 10 years ago before the incident. Her body was nowhere in the apartment as he explained. During the interrogation he was constantly  telling us that he was mentally fine and that girl was real. After further investigation we found the family of that girl, after some conversation we found out the she died 10 years ago in car accident, she was cremated. \n\nAnother weird thing was that when he was escorted out of court he kept on screaming that she was behind judge. To this day it is still a mystery how the DNA of a person who died was there.  \n"},"556":{"title":"Darkness Echoing Chapter 2 ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcsylv\/darkness_echoing_chapter_2\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Secret_Ad_640","selftext":"Chapter 1: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fc8tar\/darkness\\_echoing\\_chapter\\_1\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fc8tar\/darkness_echoing_chapter_1\/)\n\n\n\nCH**APTER 2**\n\nThe floorboards creaked under his feet as he walked up towards the the front door.\n\n-*This place has seen better days..*\n\nFred said\n\n-*Real shit-hole*\n\nSam replied, knocking on the door. His knocking pushed the door open, a foul smell wafting out the narrow opening, past the group, and then it was gone as soon as it appeared.\n\n-*The hell*?\n\nHenri exclaimed\n\n-*I'm not sure about this..*\n\nAlyssa said in a hushed tone\n\nThis whole thing was getting on their nerves, Sam could feel his pulse starting to race. Fortifying his will he called in\n\n-*Hello? Anyone home?*\n\nSam got a prickling sensation, and a feeling like the whole house shuttered, taking a deep breath and shaking off old stiffness. Then a faint, creaking voice responded from inside\n\n-*I've been expecting you, come on in*\n\nThe group stood in silence for a breath, giving each other meaningful glances, Fred looking positively goofy with fright written all-over his face\n\n-*No use standing here all day*\n\nSam said, wanting to get this over with\n\n-*Let's go*\n\nHe made his way inside, the others following. The interior looked positively ancient, but in good repair. A bit dusty, but nothing like the outside. They passed a few framed pictures hanging on a wall, it was pictures of women in black and white and old-style clothes. Something was off with them, Sam noted, not able to put his finger on it.\n\n-*The eyes*\n\nAlyssa said, coming up behind him\n\n-*What?*\n\nSam said\n\n-*Their eyes. None of their eyes are showing.*\n\nHenri responded\n\nOne woman was covering the top of her face with a fan, another one turned her head, facing away from the camera, a third woman was covering her eyes with her hand. Every single one, about a dozen photos of as many women, and not a single one captured their eyes. It was eerie as all hell\n\n-They say the eye is the window to the soul, and what is seen can never be unseen..\n\nThe same creaky voice that greeted them earlier came from somewhere inside the house\n\nHenri's hand was cramped shut, shaking slightly, Fred was looking like he'd swallowed something that wasn't supposed to be swallowed. Alyssa and Sam locked eyes, nodded slightly to each other, then entered the room where the voice came from, the other two following behind.\n\nThe room was candlelit, a big wooden desk placed in the center. Behind it there was a woman seated. She's looking down at a piece of paper with big bold black lettering, her head and face obscured by some brownish robe she's wearing.\n\n-*Hey, uhmm.., I suppose you're the fortune teller I've been in contact with? I'm Alyssa*\n\nAlyssa stammered out\n\n-*Ahh, yes. Nifty thing, the internet. I was getting lonely*\n\nThe woman said in her eerie voice, a bit of humor creeping into her voice as she looked up.\n\nThere was a stomp as someone slammed their foot into the floor\n\n-*The fuck?!*\n\nA shocked Fred exclaimed. \n\nSam had no idea what'd caused this reaction since the paper on the desk occupied all his attention, the bold lettering of unintelligible text drawing him in. It felt like mysteries he'd never even had the notion to ponder on would be revealed to him if I could read what was written there.\n\nDragging his attention away from the paper he looked up and his heart almost stopped. Her eyes.. weren't there. Deformed skin occupied the area where they should be, and coarse black string is sewn where her eyelids should be. In his shock the only thing Sam could think was *why are her eyelids sewn shut when they're already grown together?*\n\nThe woman obviously noticed the groups unease as she flashed a quick smile and apologized\n\n-*Forgive me, its been a while since I last had a visitor. That my visage would be shocking to you all slipped my mind*\n\nShe said as she worked on her hood, and a piece of clothing fell down to cover the top of her face.\n\n-*An unfortunate price to pay for this power I have. If you aren't born with it, great power requires sacrifice. Greater the sacrifice, greater the power. But where's my manners? Have a seat, honored guests*\n\nShe said, gesturing towards four heavyset wooden chairs placed opposite her. Which was odd, since the entire room had seemed bare, except for the woman, the desk and chair she was sitting on. Suddenly the entire room was furnished, with a lit fireplace to the right of the group. The paper was also gone from the desk, like it had never been there. *What could a blind woman gleam from a piece of paper anyways?* Sam thought. This entire situation feeling more and more like a dream each passing second.\n\nCalling this experience weird would be the understament of the century, the fact none in the group bolted from the house, despite sensibilities learned from watching way too many horror movies at a way too young of an age, was an *off* sensation they all felt. This wasn't real, or at least it didn't *feel* real. The wooden flooring felt real enough under their feet, and the smell of burning logs wafting from the fireplace was real enough now that they had the presence of mind to notice it. At the same time it was all *off*, like there's a window between their inner worlds and the outer.\n\n The woman was still gesturing towards the chairs placed infront of her. The group took a seat, Sam making a quick reality check of the chair, feeling it in his hands. *It sure feels real. But why wouldn't it to begin with?* He wondered.\n\n-*Welcome to my humble abode honored guests. It is information you seek, yes?*\n\nThe woman asked, or stated, it was hard to tell with her manner of speaking. Properly noticing her for the first time, apart from the horrific eyes, or lack thereof, Sam could see that she neither looked old, nor young, but rather ageless. She had some vitality about her, but also seemingly faded, and an aura of wisdom earned from many decades alive.\n\n-*Ehm, yes*\n\nAlyssa responded\n\n-*I'm interested in mysteries, old wisdom and spiritual things. My friends here needed convincing*\n\nShe indicated to the rest of the group\n\n*-but they agreed to humor me for a while and agreed to come with me to visit. Also.. you were a bit out of my price range so I needed someone to split the bill with..*\n\nShe finished, looking a bit sheepish\n\n-*I never claimed I didn't believe in the supernatural, I was just skeptical of.. this*\n\nFred said, gesturing to the room as a whole, avoiding the woman in front of them\n\n-*But now, I'm not so sure.. Something is cooking here..*\n\nHe ended, giving the woman a cautious look\n\n-*Henri here doesn't believe in something unless it's peer-reviewed* \n\nSam cut in, pointing his thumb at him\n\n-*He still hasn't told me why it is he hasn't floated out into space yet, gravity being a theory and all..*\n\nThe woman was smirking slightly, seemingly amused by something, as she shifted her head towards Sam, and he could swear she was *looking* straight at him, trough the fabric and deformed skin, with eyeballs present or not.\n\n-*It's an interesting group you have here, but you haven't told me your opinion on all.. this*\n\nShe gestured with a hand towards herself and down towards the table where the strange paper had been. *What was the writing anyways? Some sort of drawing, runic script or something different altogether?* Sam wondered.\n\n*-supernatural stuff?*\n\nShe finished\n\n-*I've had unexplainable experiences happen to me, I think most stuff have an explanation however. It's easy to assume something supernatural is going on when you're missing pieces of the puzzle. I'm open to the idea, though, it'd make life more.. interesting.*\n\nSam responded\n\nThe woman broke into a slight laughter at that\n\n-*Interesting, yeah, that is certainly a word for it..*\n\nShe said\n\n-*Excuse me*\n\nAlyssa cut in\n\n-*I couldn't help but notice, the pictures in the hallway..*\n\n*-The eyes?*\n\nThe woman interrupted, turning her head towards Alyssa\n\n-*Uhm, yeah.. The women in the pictures, their eyes, are they like..*\n\n*-Like mine? Yes, well, some of them. The sort of magic our sisterhood pracises makes our souls especially vulnerable to a certain type of magic targeting the soul. Our eyes are especially vulnerable. Weak-spots you'd call it. This isn't some great secret I'm revealing, and we've grown quite good at covering for this weakness. As you all can probably.. see*\n\nShe finished, with that same slight smirk on her lips.\n\n*-So you're saying someone could use a photo of your eyes to attack you with.. magic?*\n\nHenri asked, looking a bit pained to even ask the question\n\n-*Well, yes. Direct line of sight is superior, but a photo would do if the mage meaning to harm us is powerful enough. As you've probably noticed, I don't have to worry about photos capturing my eyes. I choose to cover the top of my face for.. other.. reasons.*\n\nSam thought he understood why she didn't want to advertise the absolute state of her face, he also felt a bit relieved knowing not all of those women in the photos had deformed themselves for.. *power, was it?*\n\n-*This is interesting and all*\n\nFred chimed in\n\n-*But it isn't what we're here for, right..?*\n\nHe threw a look at Alyssa, filled with a bit of worry.\n\nHenri was sitting still as a rock, probably in the middle of a panick attack, ready to bolt any second. Fred had been bouncing his leg all the while, throwing around worried looks here and there, while Alyssa.. She's been enwrapped by the woman from the second they sat down. Staring into the cloth covering the '*eyes*' of the woman, absorbing everything she said. Sam was thinking about how much anyone of them would remember of this strange experience, his own memory was feeling a bit blurry about stuff that happened a minute ago..\n\nAlyssa shook a bit like she came out of a trance, and turned towards Fred to answer him\n\n-*Right*\n\nShe said, flashing a smile towards him. She turned back to the woman\n\n-*I was thinking some sort of.. divination. Something you could say about us, to help us in the future, maybe? Your listing wasn't very clear about what you offered..*\n\n*-Bah, that's trinkets for fools*\n\nThe woman responded with a dismissive gesture\n\n*-I'll offer you something good. I'll offer you* ***sight***\n\n*-Sight? Like your sight?*\n\nFred asked, looking uneasily at her face\n\nShe started laughing, an unhinged edge to her cackling\n\n*-Nothing like my* ***sight***\\*. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't give it to you. Besides, you're not worthy. Not yet anyways\\*\n\nShe finished, *looking* towards Alyssa\n\n*-The* ***sight*** *I'm offering allows you to peer over the veil. You'll be able to detect spiritual beings and energies that are hidden from ordinary people*\n\nDespite the implausibility of it all, the strange feelings and experiences they've had since entering the house made it all seem real.\n\n-What's it gonna cost us? Sam asked, squinting his eyes at her -I doubt our measly dollars is enough for such a gift -You're correct. Perceptive boy She said looking pleased -Your friend group isn't ordinary. I wouldn't offer this gift to anyone, I suspect each and everyone of you have some ancestors, not too far back, that possessed great gifts. I sense the echo of them on you, you all radiate with untapped potential.. She seemed to lose focus for a second, drifting off, then she focused on the group again -The cost is a quest. I need you to get me an item -A fetch quest? Did our lives just turn into an RPG? Henri asked -RP.. what? The woman asked, perplexed -Nevermind. Yes, fetch me the item and the price is paid. There's a catch however.. You'll need the gift in order to complete the quest. So I'm going to need a guarantee, can't have you run off without getting me what I need -Where would we run off to? We live here in this city Henri exclaimed -She didn't know that! Why not tell her our addresses while you're at it.. Fred said -Imparting gifts can do strange things to some people, and there's little point in keeping secrets from me She explained -The fact that you're all high-school students, or that you She looked at Alyssa -are taking care of your impaired mother, or that you She turned towards Fred -have an upcoming boxing tournament Lastly turning to Henri -and that you need an inhalator to breathe properly. These things, and many more are known to me.\n\nAt this point nothing could shock the group, or so they thought. -Things you value now might lose meaning once my gifts are imparted, so about that guarantee.. She gestured towards the table, a paper there, like if it had always been there. Script unintelligible. -I need you to sign this -How's our signature gonna stop us from running off with this gift you keep talking about? Fred asked confused -I doubt a contract for imparting magical gifts are legally binding in a court Sam said -Blood Alyssa said in a chilly tone Confusion reigned among the the rest of the group -Very good The woman cooed -She wants us to sign with our blood Alyssa said without a hint of emotion -What the f... Fred looked quesy -No way Sam looked to the rest of the group -Let's go He said with a determined look\n\nThis craziness had gone on for long enough, hearing this talk about blood sobered him up enough to realize it was time to get the hell out of there.\n\n-Hold on The woman pleaded -This is an extraordinary opportunity. Once in a lifetime even. -That doesn't matter! We're not offering our blood to some eyeless witch! Fred roared, banging his hand onto the table. Pain shot up his arm, and he recoiled it. Crimson spreading over the table, some dribbling over the table -Oops The woman said, unable to hide a slight smirk -That's binding Fred had banged his hand right ontop of a nail protruding from the table. The group looked incredulous, except Fred, who was furious. -What kind of trickery is this?! I didn't agree to anything! -Calm down child, you'll thank me later. As I said, it's binding. You'll receive the gift, and I expect you to complete the quest. If not.. unpleasant things are going to start happening to you.\n\nSamuels hand shot out, grabbing the piece of paper. Quick as can be, he threw it into the fireplace. Suddenly Fred started screaming in agony, going down to his knees, cradling his head with his hands.\n\nThe woman tssked and lifted her arm, and magically the contract was in her hand again. The screaming from Fred stopped, a relieved gasp escaping his lips.\n\n-It's unlikely you'll be able to complete this quest alone. You'll get a proper death however, a valiant one ,fighting evil -You're the evil one Fred muttered -We sign and we all get to live? A resigned Sam asked -All four of you working together have a decent chance. -Fucks sake.. I'm doing it. Guys? Sam looked towards Alyssa and Henri -Don't give the bitch the satisfaction. I'll go at it alone. -No, Fred Alyssa interjected -I got you guys into this, I'm responsible for putting you into this situation. I won't leave you hanging. Besides, I don't know how, but I'm certain she's telling the truth. You'll die alone, Fred, but together we have a chance.\n\nThey all dribbled a bit of blood on the magical contract, thus signing it. The woman picked it up and then made it vanish into thin air.\n\n-Now that that's over with, the gift is two-parted. First I'll have to awaken your spirits, only then can I impart you with the sight\n\n-Your name Sam said -You never told us your name\n\n-Ahh, yes.. you can call me.. Cynthia\n\n-All right, Cynthia, let's get this over with. \n\nSam said, eyes ablaze and voice full of steel.\n\nEnd Of Introduction\n\n"},"557":{"title":"All My Clocks Stopped at 1:13PM","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcnpiz\/all_my_clocks_stopped_at_113pm\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"OldMate_Brenno","selftext":"My take on an old classic - [https:\/\/youtu.be\/SCagKJts\\_i0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SCagKJts_i0)  \nOriginal Story: [https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/wiki\/All\\_My\\_Clocks\\_Stopped\\_at\\_1:13\\_PM](https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/wiki\/All_My_Clocks_Stopped_at_1:13_PM)"},"558":{"title":"Date with an Alchemist ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcsjs9\/date_with_an_alchemist\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BlueHero45","selftext":"Anna was bored.

So she had to settle for reading the books in her father's, the mayor of her boring little town, study.\n\nIt was near the end of summer when Herbert came to town. Her father had introduced the man to her at a party, a pointless attempt to drum up interest in an upcoming election despite him running unopposed. Herbert was older than Anna but to her he shined with worldliness. He said he never had a true home and had been traveling his whole life. \n\nAnna was enamored with this man. For the next two weeks she took every chance to see him. He made himself comfortable renting a cabin at the edge of town. He said he likes the quiet as he works. An alchemist he called himself. He was constantly mixing glass vials of reds, greens and blues into various containers. \n\nAnna tried her best to entertain the man. Inviting him for walks along the lake, meeting her friends or dinner with her family. He always refused claiming if she wanted to spend time with him she should just stay at his cabin. She attempted to seduce the man, changing her hair and clothes to styles he preferred. But despite her efforts he said he still had to leave town soon.\n\nAnna had made her decision. Packing her bags she snuck out of her dreary little home ready to say goodbye to this dreary little town. It was early when she arrived at Herbert’s cabin and he too was packing. She announced to him she was going to go with him and they would travel the world together. That she would forever be his. He didn't seem shocked by the confession, only smiled. He reached into a bag and pulled out a vial of red liquid and handed it to Anna. “I will gladly take you with me Anna” he said “This potion will help you on our journey, take it and we will be off together forever.” Anna gladly drank down the sweet liquid.\n\nAnna awoke with a headache and a dull pain throughout her body. Herbert stood over her smiling. She found it hard to move and harder to speak. She tried to reach out but instead of an arm a goopy stump appeared. Her eyes darted around In panic revealing a body that was little more than a fleshy glob stuffed in a storage trunk. “Amazing isn't it? A single potion allows me complete control over your body. You are mine in the truest sense. Now get some rest we have a long way to travel. Then we can really see what I can do with you.” Herbert closed the trunk leaving Anna in darkness as a great big smile filled his face.\n"},"559":{"title":"The Fog of Ravenscroft","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fck9ku\/the_fog_of_ravenscroft\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"CreepyStoriesJR","selftext":"My story about visiting a friend that lives in a small eerie town.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ax6PhZPGVxI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ax6PhZPGVxI)  \n"},"560":{"title":"Behind the Curtain | Bedtime stories to dream to","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcs4or\/behind_the_curtain_bedtime_stories_to_dream_to\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"TheDarkPath962","selftext":"Sleepypasta for all!  \n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/S7LhZ4Guru4](https:\/\/youtu.be\/S7LhZ4Guru4)"},"561":{"title":"Does anyone remember that creepypasta youtuber that who made a series called \"spooky noodles\" ?

But somehow, I ended up on r\/DeepEnd, and I can’t leave. No one can.\n\nI’m posting this, hoping it’s some kind of warning. But honestly, I don’t know if I’m even in control anymore.\n\nBy the time you finish reading this, it’ll be too late for you too.\n\nI found r\/DeepEnd by accident, I think. No one told me about it. There was no invitation, no trending list, no upvotes.\n\nI was just browsing through Reddit late one night, clicking on whatever looked interesting. I don’t even remember what subreddit I was on before.\n\nBut suddenly, there it was: r\/DeepEnd.\n\nAt first, it was empty. No posts. No comments. No users. Just a blank page with the words “Welcome back” in the header.\n\nIt was strange, but Reddit has its fair share of weird subs. I figured it was one of those experimental communities, maybe part of some ARG.\n\nI was about to close the tab, but then…\n\nA post popped up, seemingly out of nowhere:\n\n“Don’t leave.”\n\nSo I didn’t. I didn’t even want to reply, but I did.\n\n“Who’s posting this?” I typed.\n\nNo response. At least, not right away.\n\nA few minutes later, I got a notification.\n\nA reply, but not from a user—just from the subreddit itself. The username was blank.\n\n“We are.”\n\nI stared at the screen for a while, half-expecting a punchline. You know, some kind of bot or troll playing games. But the longer I stared, the more uneasy I felt.\n\nThe page didn’t refresh. No other posts appeared. Just that one ominous reply.\n\nI tried to shrug it off and go back to whatever else I was doing.\n\nBut the next day, I found myself back on r\/DeepEnd.\n\nI didn’t even click on it. I was just scrolling through the front page, mindlessly browsing, when the subreddit loaded by itself.\n\nMy fingers hadn’t touched the screen. I wasn’t even looking for it. The moment I realized where I was, a new post appeared:\n\n“We see you.”\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nHow? I hadn’t subscribed to the subreddit. I hadn’t followed it. There was no reason it should have been there.\n\nThen, the messages started.\n\nFirst, they came as Reddit notifications, but they didn’t behave like normal notifications. The messages didn’t link to any user profile. They weren’t upvoted, downvoted, or replied to. They just… appeared.\n\nAnd they were getting personal.\n\n“You’ve been here before.”\n\n“We know you.”\n\n“We watch you scroll.”\n\nI turned off my phone. I left Reddit alone for days. I told myself it was just some glitch or hack. It happens, right? I was probably overthinking it.\n\nBut the next time I opened Reddit—just to check notifications, mind you—I was back on r\/DeepEnd.\n\nAnd the posts were waiting for me.\n\n“Why did you leave?”\n\n“We’re still watching.”\n\nI should’ve deleted Reddit. I should’ve just walked away. But I didn’t.\n\nThen the compulsion started.\n\nI couldn’t stop myself from typing responses. At first, I tried to resist, but I’d wake up with my phone in my hand, a comment already drafted.\n\nSometimes it wasn’t even a comment—just… something.

I’d get notifications for threads I didn’t remember participating in, comments I never wrote.\n\nEvery time I tried to delete my account, it came back.\n\nAnd the messages didn’t stop.\n\n“We know you’re reading this.”\n\n“Keep scrolling.”\n\nI tried contacting Reddit support. Nothing.\n\nI deleted the app. Reinstalled it.

Murmurs and whispers surrounded the musky canal as the water rose and the clock ticked away. Over the streets, the boatman, engulfed by the shadows of the tunnel, staggered out into the warm lights to retrieve the boat. Strangely, the water level in the canal rose more and more every day, some days overflowing the pathways. The boatman never appeared during the day except when the sky was pitch black always retrieving boats until midnight. The fractured mask he wore never came off his face, always covering his true persona. But from time to time, bystanders caught the boatman staring at them, deep into their souls and uttering words to himself. The public only knew his name as Wroc. \n\nExtravagant individuals often arrived at Venice for the different kinds of occupations and treatments, all hid beneath a mask of a poker face, burying their true self…true feelings. Whilst others are breathing in the dark, lying on its side, those wealthy narcissists play a game of imitation role playing the idea of a perfect being. Wroc despised the individuals, wishing his master was beside him. A society, heaps of judgemental beings, spreading words across districts, never a safe sanctuary. Wroc noticed no difference from the society years before. Everyone suspected and overthought, frequent incidents of drowning in the canals or the public death ceremony. He needed someone, a person who could ease all the tormented pain he contained. \n\nWroc then gazed at a peculiar gondola nearing the streets. Decorated with a pattern of bird feathers laced around the edge. A gondola, once a key to his life, a beacon of light guiding his path a decade ago. \n\nDistant memories started to reconnect in Wroc’s mind.  \n  \n*1st of January 1895*  \n  \n*Whilst travelling on a gondola, in search of a therapist, I stumbled upon a rather strange man, who donned a black mask in broad daylight, addressing himself as Dr. Naver. A scientific researcher who would venture beyond the imagination where forbidden thoughts lay ahead. I was brought as his apprentice though I did not know nor questioned the master about his exact job.* \n\n*The sunken moon smiled down on me as I followed his footsteps, imprinted on the pale snow which led me to the back shed of his manor. I trailed my eyes on to a small beam of light just stretching out of the nailed windows, thus my eyes screamed with horror from the unexplainable actions of Dr. Naver. Motionless birds danced, hanging off the hooks from the ceiling, whilst a middle-aged woman lay across the cold floor, with limbs of birds wedged against the missing organs on her disfigured body. Nevertheless, I was shocked…impressed by the audacity of the man to commit this horrendous operation.* \n\n*As if reading my mind, Dr. Nevar responded to my curious thoughts, “birds were the originality of humans. They fit the icon of beauty yet us humans have failed to recognise this. Through the combination of a human and birds, I will be able to manufacture a perfect being with a perfect mind. This lucky human is Madame Evod, a wealthy individual who sailed across the canal of Venice, in search of a cure for her condition. Her trembling hands grasped at her non-existent mask held by the fragile strands of her soul as she met me, the man who will soon reshape her life. She seemed very hopeful, though behind her smile was despair, a woman who had no one in life to reach out but Venice, known for its wide range of treatments, intrigued the Madame to approach.”*  \n  \n*From that day on, every afternoon, I have collected numerous failed patients all waiting for their treatments. Every patient was one more step to our prize. I always reminded my master that each patient was a good cause though his expression didn’t quite meet the mood of mine. Some days, Dr. Nevar would go on a violent rampage, deforming the patients as he wished.  Our goal hasn’t been achieved yet, but efforts have been made. Failed pieces arrived to me to wash away their impurities.* \n\n*But months passed, with the man’s health declining due to the minor progresses. One mournful night, after my duty ended, I galloped to the shed to find a locked entrance, with a small window exposing Dr. Nevar’s lifeless body. Interrupting the silent dreadfulness, I thrusted into the shed, discovering half of his mask shattered, with birds stuffed into his hollow eyes, and a small piece of writing written across the bloody tiles. “During the fleeting nature of life, I’ve longed for perfection, yet imperfection kept holding me back. I shall rest, not from imperfection but the failure of imperfection, as the solution was always by my side.”*\n\n*Obtaining his mangled mask, I advanced into the still of the night, reminiscing about his last words, I heaved the spiritless body of Nevar into the abyss of water allowing the body to sink into the depths of the darkness.*\n\nWroc bitterly watched as the gondola departed from Venice, fading into the dark horizon. The bare moon reflected off his discarded mask, floating upon the restless canal. Its shadow twisted and distorted, forming into the sinister shape of a raven."},"564":{"title":"Hey Yo: Part One ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcda5b\/hey_yo_part_one\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Mysterious-Ad-4795","selftext":"Hey, Yo\nby \nB.P.K.\n\nStephen Minor was eighteen when he fell out of love with the American dream. He was undisputedly done or paid no mind to social media, the current music scene, the winner of the Super Bowl, and all the shows streaming on the far too many platforms to keep track of. He also thought the United States was an all-out dumpster fire in the aftermath of the pandemic. And it didn’t matter who was president; everyone was old, crazy, and fucking full of it. In the last decade, everything seemed to have layers of rotten corruption at its core. Stephen honestly looked forward to the day that the AI machines took the ball from certain humans—mainly lawyers and influencers—because the overpopulation of cold-hearted people made him run to the toilet and blow chunks of anxiety. \nHe graduated high school the year the virus closed everything down, and Stephen’s graduation was held in his living room on Zoom. Three fellow students gazed at the little red light on their laptops, forced smiles, and emulated happy TikTok poses like the future would somehow bend back to normal and their ambitions weren’t lying in a junkyard full of broken glass. \nWhen Stephen tossed his cap into the air, a sinking and morose feeling buried itself deep down inside him. His mother, Angie, was already a widow and working two jobs to keep the lights on. She snapped a picture of him on her iPhone from the tiny kitchen in the apartment they lived in. He knew the world had changed forever, and the heavy rain thrashing the single-pane windows on the day he was officially discharged from Whitman’s Mill High School was the icing on the cake; a cake filled with droppings from angry rottweilers. \nStephen had a quarter-life dilemma: he could start college online and pay a ridiculous amount of money to watch his lecturer's internet connections lag out, pretending to pay attention, or skip college altogether and go into what the ancient ones called a trade. Stephen informed the college he would not be attending and asked for his money back. A few weeks later, a refund check came in the mail. He went down to the local pizza shop, Mario’s Pizza, with a wallet full of money from the cashed check and bought a large pizza for himself and Angie. While the pizza was baking, Stephen went out the back of the store and bought a new strand of weed from Mario’s attractive goth meets hippie daughter who worked at the pizza joint part-time. \nThe new weed was called Nirvana Rama 92. And Kayla, the easy-on-the-eyes dealer of this la mode marijuana blend, told Stephen it would give him the best damn high he’s ever had. He shrugged as he placed some big bills into Kayla’s palm. Greasy food and greasy palms make the world go round. On his walk back to the apartment, the pizza box leaked hot oil from one of its corners. Stephen stopped to rearrange the cheesy pie to avoid second-degree burns. \nHe placed the cardboard box on the ground and opened it. Mario had forgotten the mushrooms, and Stephen picked some hairs from his eyebrows. The eyebrow picking was a new habit that started during lockdown; stress and boredom make people do funny things. It was also a friendly reminder he wasn’t one of the millions who died from the virus. Sometimes, masochistic gestures are a painful way to find temporary euphoria in an otherwise cheerless world. \nStephen closed the pizza box and picked it up. He took two steps, and that's when he heard the deep and menacing voice echo off Fogger Lake. He stopped on a penny and glanced at the lake seated parallel to the road. The water looked black as death, like millions of restless skeletons covered in putrid moss lay beneath it, ready to jump out and grab whoever got too close. Stephen’s heart was thumping, and he felt like something was watching him—something not kind.\n“Hey, yooo,” the voice said, lethargic and bassy.\nIt was 8 pm. The sun had descended for the day, and a starless twilight blanketed the sky. The summer air was sticky and had a moldy odor. Cicadas and grasshoppers chittered from the tall trees behind the lake. The streetlights were spaced far apart on Cratchit Road, and Stephen found himself standing in total darkness. It was also a seldom-trafficked road, but it cut a direct line from the apartment complex to Mario’s. Stephen used it to save time and was low-key proud that he always returned with a hot pizza. A pizza his mother could relish before she left for the night shift at Village Oaks Nursing Home. But there was nothing low-key or anything to relish about Stephen's present circumstances. \nAgain, the lazy, glottal voice chanted, “Hey, yooo.” \nStephen stared at Fogger Lake. Every thread of sinewy muscle in his body cautioned him not to wander toward the lake, and he didn’t want Angie worrying that he’d been kidnapped or murdered by a lunatic clown because he was late. But the voice had been so charming, suave, and familiar that Stephen tried putting a face to it. Nobody’s countenance came to him. His phone buzzed in his pocket, giving him a jumpy fright. He guessed it was his mother, wondering where he was. Since the outbreak of the virus, she’d become monumentally overprotective. Remember to wash your hands. Don’t forget your mask. Stephen, the next vaccine comes out in six months. You need to stay up-to-date. \nWhen had he become a Mac operating system that needed an update every six months? Whether it was a bat in a cave or a laboratory leak in China, Stephen loathed the inciting incident that released the virus, and that words like efficacy and respirator were part of the everyday lexicon. He kicked a medium-sized rock to reset his mind- and turned his back to Fogger Lake. Stephen would wait five more seconds to see if he heard the voice again. A slothful June breeze was blowing, and it was healthy enough to make the verdant branches rustle. And the cicadas and grasshoppers were still piping out the song of nature like the Mormon Tabernacle. Five seconds passed. Fogger Lake was silent for now. \nAfter eating dinner with Angie in the living room, he went into his room and locked the door. Angie had a friend, a guy friend named Phil. Stephen thought he was a con man who looked like the illegitimate offspring of Jeff Bezos and Queen Camilla. Phil had a desk job in Harveston selling home warranties, and it roiled Stephen when Phil (always in khakis and a polo) and Angie stood side by side because they looked like the ideal couple used in a Progressive commercial. Stephen didn’t want to admit that the two were dating, but they’d been seeing each other for three months. They were absolutely dating. But he better not be hiding his meat stick inside my mom. \nPhil called while Angie and Stephen were eating and asked if he could come over before she left for work. Angie looked at Stephen with petitioning eyes. He told her it was fine. Stephen didn’t finish the second slice of pizza on his plate and walked into the kitchen, tossing it in the trash. \nStephen’s bloodline father, Howard Minor, died in an airplane crash when Stephen was eight years old. It didn’t make the front-page news because it was a private flight, and Howard wasn't famous. He flew on a twin-engine Cessna that took off from a one-lane runway airport in Reading, Pennsylvania. Its destination was San Francisco, where Howard, a sedulous and intelligent man with a PhD in physics and a lot of student debt, was meeting with a tech startup. \nThe meeting was supposed to be about designing and producing a car engine that operated on desalinated water. Stephen awoke bolt upright on the day of his father’s flight; his NASA T-shirt drenched in sweat. Ten years later, Stephen still remembers the nightmare from that night with torturing vividness. \nHe was walking through an abandoned mall; most shops had their steel gates down, and the lights flickered on and off, buzzing ferociously overhead. In the nightmare, Stephen was older (13) and had a mouth full of bubblegum. He tried to spit the gum out, but it wouldn’t flee his mouth. Stephen efforted to pluck the gum out with his fingers, working his index finger at the wad of sticky sugar like it was chewing tobacco. But the bubblegum refused to come out. \nHe saw his father walk out of the Barnes and Noble and ran up to him. Howard had the latest Stephen King novel and some science magazines in his hand. He also had sunglasses on—large framed teardrop aviators—and Stephen could catch his reflection in them. He opened his mouth, pointed to the gum, and jumped up and down. But Howard just stood there, expressionless and static. \n“Herp mi,” Stephen said, the gum distorting and reshaping the words he was trying to say. Howard was like a wax statue in a pitiful lobby inside a cheap Las Vegas hotel.\n Stephen looked at his father, closely examining his face. His features were buttery smooth as if he were cropped from a digital picture that was blurred in post-production and dropped into Stephen’s nightmare. There were also forbidding smears of black dust sneaking out from behind the aviator sunglasses. WHOOSH! The gum jumped out of Stephen’s mouth like a mad-as-hell alien leaving its host corpse. Luckily for Stephen, he’d never seen the movie Alien, saving him from an R rating for blood and violence in this unconscious movie of his. He glanced up and saw the dribbly mass of gum was the size of an octopus. It was sticking to one of the rectangular skylights. The gummy cephalopod curled and spun around in tight split-second circles until it hit the brakes. The gelatinous mold contorted into a sad emoji face and looked down on Stephen. He gave it the middle finger and  turned his attention to Howard. \n\t“Dad, are you okay?” Stephen said. “You got this… stuff around your eyes.” \n\tHoward slowly raised a hand to his face and took off the aviators. Stephen's eyes went wide as Mars and his heart shook like a tuning fork being hit with a hammer. The eyes of Howard Minor were melted out of his skull, and the flesh around his eye sockets were scabs and jagged crust, burnt the color of West Virginia coal. \n“Dad!” Stephen screamed, tears welling in the corners of his eyes. \nThen came a roaring and nerve-jangling crashing sound. Stephen glanced up, and the batshit crazy bubblegum squid burst through the skylight, sending huge shavings of glass to the floor. They dropped around Stephen and Howard like spikes in a Mortal Kombat death pit. BAM! BAM! BAM! Stephen gasped for air, his lungs burning from inhaling so hard. Howard chucked a rolled-up magazine at Stephen, hitting him in the testicles. He bent over and saw it was a copy of Flight Journal, and on the cover was a red and white Cessna 340. Cupping the twins, Lefty and Righty, with his hand, Stephen was nonplussed—the man he loved the most in the world, dream or no dream, was assaulting him. Howard was no longer a hellish wax statue; he was something more, something baneful. But Stephen was a gobsmacked painting of Machiavelli, trapped by the absurd laws of a venal environment. \n“Why did you do that?” he screamed at Howard, his voice cracking as it peaked with madness. \nHoward charged him, yelling obscenities. Stephen parried the attack and hid behind one of the glass pieces that had fallen seconds earlier. The prismatic displays in the column-like glass combined with the radiant lights of the mall created a disorienting funhouse mirror effect. There were duplicate Stephens all around. Howard was unsure which one to murder. Behind Stephen, the Sears gate shook, rattled, and rolled up. He took off and raced into the dimly lit Sears with Howard hot on his heels. Stephen entered the Sears and glimpsed for a place to hide. The store was decorated for Christmas, and garland and wreaths glittered. Levi’s jeans were 25% off. And an eighties rock band cover of \"Come All Ye Faithful\" howled over the speakers.   \n"},"565":{"title":"The last day you will ever be pretty","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fcj3te\/the_last_day_you_will_ever_be_pretty\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"A group of 10 people were called upon to come together and to meet up at a place.

Tales of death and uncanniness follow.\n\n.\n\nI’ve lived in the desert all my life.\n\nThose long, hot days really get to you after a while.\n\nUsually, when people think of the desert, they imagine rocky cliffs, sand, saguaros, lizards, and the worst sunburn that you can imagine. Those are all true.\n\nOther people think of sudden, violent storms; strange howling in the darkness; or maniacal people driven mad by the heat. Those are also true. But the everyday lies somewhere in between.\n\nLet me start by saying that I’ve moved around the Southwestern United States for a few years, but it is generally the same everywhere. Occasionally, the lizards change. The saguaros disappear. The temperatures peak at 108F instead of 125F. But the general aesthetic of each area does not differ.\n\nNor do the warnings.\n\nI love hiking – I have always been a huge fan of the woods. On my visits to the Pacific Northwest, you couldn’t get me out of them. But hiking in the desert is obviously very different.\n\nFor example, no amount of water that you bring is ever enough. If you go hiking at sunrise, you will have drained your canteen within a few hours. Hiking around noon is enough to leave you with heatstroke if you visit the trails during the wrong time of year.\n\nThe wrong time of year, unfortunately, coincides with most people’s time off from work, or school. Plenty of people visit the Southwest believing that they know what they are getting into. Believing that they have enough water, and that the temperatures are not too high.\n\nEvery year, dozens of people from other habitats brave the hiking trails and never return. They die of heatstroke, or dehydration, or fall from a cliff after a mistimed step. Occasionally, their bodies are recovered by helicopters, search parties, other hikers. Generally, they are never found. Picked apart by wild animals and bleached by the sweltering sun.\n\nEven the locals underestimate the violent environment and meet their demise.\n\nI knew a young couple who were experienced hikers. They had gone on the same hiking trail dozens of times before. The day wasn’t that hot, they knew what they were doing. But somehow, during the two-hour hike, they both succumbed to heatstroke and were found dead.\n\nNobody quite knows how it could have happened. But this hiking path was famous for catching people off guard. You see, the desert isn’t always hot. Often, it will be quite cold here, especially if you head out early enough in the morning. The official story was that the young couple set out early enough in the day that it was still cold enough to hike. But the trail veered into higher altitudes, away from shade entirely. Leaving them exposed to the bare sky overhead, the sweltering sun that came out of nowhere, rising the temperature to the late 90’s before their hike had even finished.\n\nAnd they were gone. Just like that.\n\nIt happens often in the desert. We go hiking, go to a carnival, walk to the store – and overlook the sun.\n\nHeatstroke is a funny little thing. Just as dehydration is at its highest, your body will force itself to throw up, further ridding yourself of necessary liquids. I never quite understood the point of it.\n\nIt isn’t uncommon to find dead animals, either, even in the middle of the city. I have walked over dead cats, dead rodents, and dead birds on my way to class. However, the worst corpses to find are the ones that are in pieces.\n\nYesterday, on a hike, I stumbled across the intestines, kidneys, and liver of a small creature. The parts had been perfectly removed, and were still assembled as though inside the animal’s body. They were cleanly set on the dirt, and there were no tufts of fur, flesh, or even blood beside the entrails. It was as though the creature’s insides had been transported outside of its body without damage.\n\nIt never feels normal running into these corpses. You learn to ignore them, to turn aside and keep hiking higher into the hills. Closer to the ever-burning sun overhead. But you have to ignore them.\n\nWe never talk about these things, either. They are a part of everyday life that everyone quickly gets used to.\n\nThe majority of people, however, just don’t notice. And the darker areas of our world remain hidden.\n\nBut once you begin to notice, you can never go back.\n\nWhile I was hiking yesterday, I had the sensation that I was being watched. It isn’t uncommon to run into wildlife in the mountains that I was walking across. I try to remain vigilant and scan the outcrop of rocks for the head of a cougar, or the snout of a distant coyote, but it really is hopeless. The camouflage of wildlife in the desert is outstanding – you will not notice them until you have wandered directly into their path.\n\nBut they will notice you. As I made my way higher and higher into the mountain, I had the sensation that every living creature in this park knew exactly where I was, although I would never even know that they were there.\n\nIt is difficult to keep an eye out for everything that could endanger you. My eyes rarely strayed from the trail, to avoid stepping on a rattlesnake, or turning my ankle on a rock. Stumbling could lead to ripped pants or a pitch over the side of a cliff – the gamble was far too great.\n\nSo you are in the mountains, and you are watching where you step. You are keeping track of your water, you are ensuring that you have enough to last the journey back. The mountains know that you are there, but they are leaving you alone, and you are lucky enough not to have run into another person. People are often more unpredictable in the desert than anywhere else, especially after they have been fried a little by the sun.\n\nBut then you get lost. All the rocks look the same, and there aren’t any trail markers to keep track of.\n\nI tried not to panic. After all, I still had enough water for a little while longer. And my phone battery wasn’t dead. There wasn’t a signal, but at the absolute worst, I could just scurry in a straight line until I met back with the road.\n\nThen I made the one mistake you are always told never, ever to do – I left the trail.\n\nIt was an accident – my feet wandered from the path, thinking that I found a shortcut, and then I was gone. Lost off-trail, my feet being tangled by cactus pods, which have an uncanny ability to claw through your shoes.\n\nIf you have never seen a jackrabbit up close, they look like otherworldly creatures. These are skeletal, elongated beasts – far from the round, fuzzy bunnies that most people are accustomed to seeing in pet stores. A large jackrabbit can be taller than your knees, with piercing eyes that seem much too human.\n\nI startled a jackrabbit, and it scared the living hell out of me. One second the ground was a settlement of rocks, and the next, it was escaping into the distance like an apparition.\n\nBut I didn’t start to panic until my water dropped below the halfway mark. This is the time that you are told to turn back, to always leave yourself enough hydration to make your way home. I felt the flutterings of panic, then. Just barely beginning to build in my chest.\n\nBecause it is all too easy to make a simple mistake – one misplaced step, one wrong turn – and end up as another missing person.\n\nThere was the distant sound of a donkey braying, which momentarily distracted me from my fear. Feral donkeys live in our national parks, they are often seen wandering into town or standing outlined against the horizon. But I had never heard one bray before.\n\nFascinated, I remember tracing the rocks for the donkey. However, the curiosity quickly gave away to confusion as I realized that I could not tell where the sounds were coming from.\n\nThe braying began on my left, but sounded a second later from my right – close enough that the animal should have been visible. Yet, it simply wasn’t. There was nothing at all surrounding me on the mountains.\n\nAnd there was no noise, either. No birdsong, or wind, or even the rushing of cars in the distance. Only the mournful cry of a donkey, twisted as though in pain.\n\nAs soon as I stumbled away from the noises, I found the trail again. It just appeared out of nowhere, but I was too grateful to question my good fortune.\n\nI didn’t hear the donkey at all on the way back home.\n\n.\n\nOccasionally, I will talk to my other friends who enjoy hiking, and we will exchange stories of our encounters. It isn’t uncommon to find yourself completely lost, but there are other, more interesting tales of the rocky outcrops.\n\nYou will find lizards in the desert. They are everywhere – some with long, blue tails; others with blue throats; or shimmering scales in a multitude of colors. But one of my hiking friends, a graduate student named Laura, told me about her strange experience with lizards.\n\nShe was an amateur wildlife photographer on a stroll through a hiking path, when she also found herself completely lost.\n\n“It was the weirdest thing,” Laura told me. “One minute, I could see the parking lot in the distance, the next there was nothing but rocks.”\n\nAs she wandered through the mountain, searching for the trail, she wandered by the same lizards that all desert dwellers are accustomed to. But the deeper that she went, the larger they started to become.\n\n“I saw a *Sceloporus* that was larger than my torso,” Laura said. There was an otherworldly expression on her face, halfway between curiosity and fear. “I never saw anything like it before… But when I pulled out my camera, it disappeared into the rocks.”\n\nShe eventually returned to the same hiking path, but could never find the same trail that she had wandered onto. And she never saw the gigantic lizards again.\n\nI had a similar experience myself – of straying too deep into the mountains and finding that the local lizards were steadily increasing in size. But I never followed them off the trail.\n\nMy other friends have withdrawn from hiking altogether, but they have sobering tales of the city. Stories about days spent in the sweltering heat, melting asphalt that stuck to their shoes, and birds that were falling dead from the sky.\n\n“It was horrible,” One of my friends told me. He was a quiet man named Skylar who couldn’t afford a car, so he used the local buses to get around. This was especially difficult during the summer, when the short walk to a bus station could end up dehydrating you severely.\n\n“I heard something hit the ground behind me,” Skylar said. “I thought that it was a piece of trash at first, that somebody had thrown something at me from their car. It wouldn’t be the first time. But then I realized that it had feathers.”\n\nHe pursed his lip.\n\n“Sick bird, you know, you don’t think much of it. Until the second one fell. And the next. They were falling from the sky like hail, littering the ground with unmoving bodies.”\n\nSkylar lowered his voice, nearly turning away from me. “The asphalt was so hot. Sticky. For a moment, I thought that it moved beneath my feet. I thought that my mind was playing tricks on me – you know, from the birds. But when I turned around again, all of the birds were gone. There was this sucking noise, and all the bodies were gone.”\n\nHe stared into the distance, with a little shrug. “Take from that what you will. But I haven’t left the sidewalk since then.”\n\nMy friend Elena told me to always lock my doors.\n\n“I know that it’s common sense, but you have no idea how many people leave their front doors unlocked during the day. You don’t want to be visited by the Meat Man.”\n\nI immediately asked her what she was talking about.\n\n“You’re looking for unusual stories, right?” Elena lowered her tone to a secret, conspiratory whisper. But there was something serious about her expression.\n\n“My mom leaves the front door open during the day sometimes, but only when we’re home. She told me that she was making dinner, when she noticed a strange man in our doorway. Apparently, he let himself in through the open door.”\n\nElena shakes her head. “Didn’t knock, or ring the bell, or anything. And he asked her if she was interested in buying meat.”\n\n“Meat?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, like fresh meat that he had to sell. He just kept staring at her, asking if she was interested in buying meat. *Fresh meat, whatever you want. Allllll kinds of meat.*”\n\n“What kind of meat?”\n\n“I don’t know. He didn’t say, and my mom didn’t ask. She was really freaked out – she demanded that he leave, or she was going to call the police. He left quietly after that, but she noticed that he had this weird cart outside. It was full of red, raw pieces of meat. He was going door to door, trying to sell people meat. It was the weirdest thing that I ever encountered.”\n\n“He was probably just crazy,” I offered, but Elena didn’t seem convinced.\n\n“Maybe. But after he came by, my neighborhood started complaining about strange noises at night. Scratching at the doors and windows, weird markings in the dirt outside. The man continuously coming back, ringing the doorbell and trying to get inside. And you know, the weirdest thing is that my mom *swears* that she *did* lock the door on the first day that the man came inside our house.”\n\nMy friends’ stories unsettled me, but I heard many similar ones through the grapevine. From a friend of a friend of an acquaintance. About the strange things that happen here, that we all overlook and ignore.\n\nWhen I told my friend CJ about the giant lizards, they twisted their expression in disgust.\n\n“Giant ants. I’ve seen the world’s largest ants building colonies on the side walk. They are the biggest ants that I have ever seen, I swear that they could carry off a hamster. But I’ve… I’ve had more trouble with the little ones.”\n\nThe Southwestern United States has several species of fire-ants that found their way here from Africa, as well as many other insects that can make your time here very painful. We tend to be very careful about insects. But sometimes it’s impossible to keep them out.\n\nCJ looked very uncomfortable. “I’ve always had trouble with bugs,” They tell me. “I feel like I’m cursed. When I go outside, they fly at me, drowning themselves in my water, or pitching straight down my throat while I am walking. But the worst experience was last week. I woke up to a strange, itching feeling, like something was walking on me. When I turned on the light, I realized that I was covered in ants. *Entirely* covered in ants, from my toes to my head. They were all over my sheets, all over my skin. I don’t think that I’ve *ever* felt that itchy in my life. But they weren’t anywhere else in my room. Not on the floor, not even on the food that I left on my desk. Just my bed, just on me. And I never figured out how they got inside.”\n\nAfter shuddering, CJ began to scratch themselves, flicking a small insect from their skin with a horrified, disgusted expression.\n\n“Always,” They said, hollowly. “No matter how many times I get rid of them, they always come back.”\n\n.                                                                                             \n\nThe last story was from my friend Tim. It was about Dust Devils – those random dust storms that appear out of nowhere, like miniature tornadoes. They can cause zero visibility while driving and are actually quite dangerous, but they are generally accepted as a factor of life. But my friend Tim told me that he was trapped inside one once.\n\n“It was a normal day, there wasn’t a whisk of wind or a cloud in the sky. I was just walking around the block. And you know that I live in the city, right, not near the foothills or anywhere rural. Just in the middle of the city, walking around the block, and I notice that it’s starting to get a little bit windy. Before I even have the chance to think any more than that, I am suddenly trapped in a whirling column of sand. Tiny rocks and sticks are hitting me, my hat is clamped *tight* in my fist so it doesn’t fly off. And I’m thinking, *Oh my god, I’m inside a Haboob*.”\n\nHis eyes widened with the memory. “I was scared shitless, I had no idea if I was going to be carried off, or hit by something really heavy. And you know you can get Valley Fever from those things. But before I have the chance to fully panic, the damn thing passes over me, and I see it turning around the corner. Craziest shit that I ever experienced.”\n\nWhen I first listened to the stories from my peers, I didn’t know what to make of them. I knew my own experiences in the desert were strange at best – otherworldly at worst. But I didn’t realize how much of our everyday lives were overlooked as being mundane occurrences.\n\nI don’t know what I seek by compiling this list, but I suppose just to let the world know what happens beneath their noses. That the dark, endless woods can be frightening, but there is an uncanniness to the sweltering cliffs of the desert Southwest that you cannot find anywhere else on earth.\n\nThat while you are here, the desert knows who you are, and it is watching you.\n\nWaiting.\n\n.\n\nLike this short story?

It’s not the best job in the world, but it allows me to save some money to move out from my unsupportive parents' place, and it’s easy enough. You pick up a bag, drop it off, and repeat until your shift’s over. No real thinking required. Most people don’t even answer the door. They just let you leave the food at the front, send a quick “thank you” text, and you’re on your way.\n\nBut about a month ago, I started noticing something weird during my late-night runs. It wasn’t anything big at first. Just a guy standing across the street whenever I’d park. At first, I thought it was just another person out for a walk—there are plenty of those around. But then I realized it was always the same guy, in the same spot, just standing there. Watching.\n\nI’m not talking once or twice. This was happening every shift. Always at different locations, but there he was—across the street, just standing there. Staring.\n\nHe never moved. Not toward me, not away. Just stood there. I’d do the delivery, get back in my car, and when I drove off, he’d still be standing in the same place, watching me leave.\n\nI didn’t want to think too much about it. You see all kinds of weird stuff when you work late nights, and you learn pretty quickly that the less you notice, the better. But after a week of this, it got under my skin. I started looking for him at every stop, expecting him to be somewhere in the scene. And he always was.\n\nOne night, I was doing a delivery in the suburbs, one of those quiet neighborhoods where the only sound you hear is your own footsteps. It was just past midnight, and I was carrying a bag of burgers and fries to a small house on the corner of Maple and 7th. As I got out of my car, I looked across the street, and sure enough, there he was. Same guy. Same dark clothes. Standing on the sidewalk across from me, staring.\n\nI tried to ignore him, walked up to the house, and dropped the bag at the door like usual. As I turned around, I caught movement from the corner of my eye. He hadn’t moved, but something about him seemed… closer. I blinked, trying to convince myself it was just my imagination.\n\nWhen I got back in the car, I checked the rearview mirror. He was still standing there, but now his face was clearer under the streetlight. Blood-red crosses were painted on his skin. And those eyes… they were like holes. Hollow, unfocused, but still somehow locked on me, making floods of shame wash over my unconscious.\n\nI drove off quickly, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t look back.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to spend the night together at his, enjoying a rare evening of relaxation. He’s been incredibly supportive, especially since I’ve been working so much and saving up to move out from my parents' place. I’ve been waiting for the right time to find our own space, where we can be ourselves without hiding or sneaking around.\n\nThat night, we were talking about my plans, and I mentioned the strange guy who kept appearing. I was hoping sharing it with him would help me process it better. He listened intently and tried to reassure me it was probably just a coincidence or a freak who stayed up in the late hours, like me. I felt a little better after talking to him, but the uneasy feeling never quite went away.\n\nThe next night, the same thing happened, but this time it was worse. I was delivering to an apartment complex on the edge of town. I parked by the entrance, grabbed the bag of chicken nuggets, and as soon as I stepped out, I saw him. Not across the street this time, but on the same sidewalk, standing under a flickering streetlamp.\n\nHe was closer. Too close.\n\nI hurried through the delivery, not caring about making sure everything was perfect, and rushed back to my car. I locked the doors the second I got inside. I didn’t dare look up until I was driving away. When I did, he was gone.\n\nI should’ve stopped working nights right then and there. But money’s tight, and the late-night shifts pay better. And let’s be real, I need every bit of it. It’s not just about keeping my head above water—it’s about getting out. Getting away from my parents, their small minds, their small house, their small, religious town.\n\nI don’t talk about it much, but I’ve been putting every spare penny aside. Saving for that perfect moment when I can finally move out for good, get a place of my own. A place where I don’t have to hide every part of myself, where I don’t have to sneak around or pretend like I’m someone I’m not. When I discuss the man stalking me with my boyfriend, he thinks that the reason I keep the late-night shifts is just about money. But it’s more than that. It’s my freedom.\n\nThen, a few nights ago, something happened that I can’t explain away.\n\nI was out on my last delivery of the night, in a nice and conservative neighborhood where the streets were mostly empty after dark. It was a giant house with a gate and a long driveway. I parked at the end, grabbed the Indian takeaway, and started walking up to the house. Halfway there, I froze.\n\nHe was inside the gate.\n\nNot across the street, not on the sidewalk, but right there, just standing next to a tree at the edge of the property. Watching me.\n\nMy legs felt like they were made of lead, but I forced myself to push past him. I made the delivery, dropped the food on the porch, and practically sprinted back to my car. I didn’t even care if the guy was *right there*. I just wanted to get away to safety.\n\nAs soon as I got in the car, I locked the doors and stared straight ahead, not daring to look around. My hands were shaking as I put the car in reverse. Then, my phone buzzed.\n\nA text. From my own number.\n\n**“Don’t turn around.”**\n\nI felt the blood drain from my face. I was gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles were white. Another buzz.\n\n**“He’s behind you.”**\n\nI couldn’t help it. I glanced in the rearview mirror.\n\nNothing.\n\nBut when I looked forward again, I nearly screamed. He was standing in front of my car, just outside the gate, his lips forming inaudible words, his hands stretched out toward the sky, fingers splayed, palms up as if offering me to something higher, something far beyond my understanding. His face, painted with those blood-red crosses, twisted in desperation as if he was pleading for himself—or me. His lips moved faster, fervently, but the words wouldn’t reach me. His eyes, those hollow eyes, locked onto mine. The realization struck me hard, making my breath catch. He wasn’t just standing there—he was performing some sort of ritual, a frantic prayer that turned the space between us into both sacred ground and a firepit.\n\nI don’t know how I managed to drive away without crashing. I didn’t look back, didn’t stop until I was home. I ran inside, locked every door and window, and sat in the dark, shaking.\n\nThe messages haven’t stopped, even though I’ve switched to day shifts only and no longer see him. Every night, I get a text from my own number. They’re always short and simple, but they all mean the same thing: he’s still watching.\n\nAnd earlier today, when I parked outside my parents’ house after another long shift, I got one more.\n\n**“Let me in.”**\n\nI don’t know what’s going to be the end of this. I don’t know how to stop who—or what—he is. But I do know one thing.\n\nIf you ever see a man standing across the street from you, watching, don’t ignore him.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don’t let him in."},"570":{"title":"What the hell was following me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbu330\/what_the_hell_was_following_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BETTA-system","selftext":"I’ve been living in this town for a couple of months now, in that old ass part where the city kind of just gives up, and you’re left with these ancient streets, no lights, and houses that look like they haven’t changed since forever. It's quiet, but too quiet, you know? Not the peaceful kind - the unsettling kind. The streets get pitch black at night, like the lights just give up after sundown, and if you need to go out after dark, you’re walking blind. That’s where my problem started.  \n  \nI work late shifts at this 24-hour convenience store. It’s not great, but it pays. The real issue is the walk home. When my shift ends at 2 or 3 in the morning, there’s no light out there. Just pure black. You’d think I’d just use a flashlight, and yeah, I carry one, but it’s more of a backup. Flashlights don’t give you enough range visibility in a dark like this in my opinion. If I had used a more powerful one, it would've just been annoying for the neighbors and their pets. That’s why I started using the night vision goggles. The type with an infrared illuminator. I’d had them for a while. Bought them a few years back when me and my friends went on night hikes a lot in the late afternoon, sometimes stayed out past dark. So when I started these night shifts, it just made sense to use them. I could see the whole street, not just whatever was right in front of me. Seemed like a no-brainer.  \n  \nA couple weeks back, I was walking home, same route as always. It’s quiet, dead empty. No one walks around at that hour. I’ve got the goggles on, watching the street in a light green tint, and halfway through my route, I notice something - something moving. Way off in the distance.  \nAt first, I thought it was just some kind of animal, maybe a person out late. But something felt off. The way it moved was... wrong. It was fast, too fast, and the way it moved didn’t look human. Its arms swung wide, legs moving weirdly, like they weren’t really in sync with the rest of its body. I thought the goggles were messing with me at first. Night vision can do that - make things look weird, distort stuff. But this was different.  \nI just stood there, watching it sprint across the far end of the road, waiting for it to stop or disappear. It didn’t for quite some time. It kept moving, fast and steady, and then, just like that, it was gone. Out of sight.  \nI remember standing there, thinking, \"What the fuck was that?\" My heart was racing a bit, but I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was just someone running, maybe I misread how fast they were going. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t it. It was too fast. Too off. But I had no proof, and nobody was gonna believe me if I said I saw something weird through a pair of night vision goggles at 3 AM.  \nI saw it again a few more times that week. Always far away. Always moving fast, too fast for it to make sense. But every time, it was just far enough that I could convince myself it wasn’t real. That maybe I was just tired, or my mind was playing tricks on me. Until last night. Last night was different.  \n  \nI was deep into the dark part of the town - those narrow, pitch-black paths that cut through the old buildings. No streetlights for what feels like miles, no way to turn back once you’re in. I had the goggles on, walking my usual route, everything lit up in that faint greenish glow. And then I saw it again.  \nIt was far away at first, standing at the end of the path, just... watching. Not moving. Just standing there.  \nI froze. My stomach dropped. This wasn’t like the other nights where it was sprinting off in the distance. This time, it wasn’t running. It was facing me. I couldn’t make out its face, but the shape was all wrong again. Too tall, too thin, just like before. But now it wasn’t moving.  \nThen, it started walking toward me. Slowly. Deliberately.  \n  \nI knew right then it was following me. I don’t know how the hell it knew I was there. Maybe it could see the infrared light from the goggles, maybe not. I’ve read before that some animals can see infrared, like snakes and certain predators. The goggles light up everything in front of me, sure, but that also means I’m shining this invisible beam out into the dark. If it could see that, then it knew exactly where I was.  \nBut the thing is, it didn’t look like any animal. It didn’t look like anything that made sense. And that’s what fucked me up. It was walking straight toward me like it knew where I was, but if it couldn’t see the infrared, then it’d have to rely on sound, right? I was walking quietly, not making much noise, but if it could see the infrared, I was screwed.  \nI had to make a call. I could keep the goggles on, try to see where it was going, but then I’d risk it tracking me down from the light. Or I could turn them off, but then I’d be walking blind. And that thing, whatever it was, would still be out there. Coming closer.  \nI kept walking, trying to keep calm, but I couldn’t stop glancing back. Every time I did, it was closer. Not running, not sprinting like before, just slowly getting closer. It was far enough that it wasn’t an immediate threat, but the fact that it wasn’t stopping? That told me everything I needed to know.  \nIt was definitely following me.  \n  \nI made a decision. I reached up, flicked the goggles off. Instantly, everything went black. No faint glow, no visible path. Just pure, suffocating darkness. I stood there for a second, frozen, wondering if I’d just fucked myself over. I couldn’t see a damn thing. I was walking blind. But at least I wasn’t lighting myself up like a target anymore I guess.  \nI started walking again, slower this time. I had to rely on memory to guide me - I knew the streets well enough, but in the dark, everything feels different. Every step felt like a gamble. And the worst part? I had no fucking clue how close that thing was now. I couldn’t hear it. Couldn’t see it. It could’ve been right behind me, and I’d have no way of knowing. Every sound made me jump. My own footsteps felt too loud. My breathing felt too obvious. I kept telling myself it couldn’t see me, that without the infrared light, it’d lose track of me. But what if it could still hear me? What if it was just waiting for the perfect moment?  \n  \nEventually, I made it back to my place. Fumbled with the keys, hands shaking, heart pounding so loud it was all I could hear. I got inside, locked the door, and just stood there, listening for anything outside. But there was nothing. Just silence.  \nI don’t know what I saw. I don’t know if it’s a person, some kind of animal, or something else entirely. All I know is that it’s out there and it was following me.   \nNow, I’m stuck thinking about what comes next. That thing has seen me. It knows where I go, where I walk every night. Was last night just a warning? Is it going to come closer next time? What if it’s waiting for me? I’ve thought about changing my route, taking the long way through the parts of town that still have some light. But that’s just a delay. I’ll still have to walk through the dark to my house eventually, still have to face whatever the hell that thing is.  \n  \nTomorrow night, I’ll be back on that same path. And I don’t know if I’ll make it home again."},"571":{"title":"Three videos from Mexico, NASA and USA, Clear video footage of a UFO.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fceqjd\/three_videos_from_mexico_nasa_and_usa_clear_video\/","flair":"Video","author":"forhealthy","selftext":"Interesting UFO video scenes from different places, watch them and tell me what you think.\n\nClear video footage of a UFO, It looks like an octopus in the sky of Mexico.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vk2ZCFp9miw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vk2ZCFp9miw)\n\nClear UFO footage leaked from NASA.

We all need human interaction and making meaningful relationships are just so rare now. I have become good at doing this and I do really enjoy it. \n\nAny how I started another fake job posting for a website programmer. I gave the salary to be about half a million pounds. I myself simply work as self employed for an egency and they send me to various places to do various work, like gardening or maintenance work. Any how I got loads of applications and I chose one guy. This guy seemed like a nice dude and I told him that the interview has 5 steps. Each of those steps will be conversational and me getting to know what he is like. I ask him thr generic questions like his qualifications and which university he went to. \n\nHe told me about his past jobs and then the interview got more conversational. He started telling me about his father and how in his father had invented something incredible. This invention could calculate how many people there were in the room.

Then his father clocked him and shouted at him for using it. The reason this invention hadn't gone far was because the government didn't allow for it to go far, because the government doesn't want people to know how many people there are in the world. Everyone thinks it's 8 billion and the government wants to keep it that way, so they could secretly kills off the the 42 billion. His father's machine could even tell whether your part of the 42 billion that government want to kill off, or the 8 billion. \n\nIt was impressive conspiracy shit that i didnt believe. Then it all came crashing down when he found out the job was a fake. He was set to expose me until I killed him in a field.

That bitch Caitlyn could take everything else from me, except my job, my money. I had decided I should take some time for myself and try to enjoy some time alone. So I took a vacation. I had heard of this resort from a colleague at my work so I decided I should give it a try. Vacation started off at this nice, expensive luxury resort. Shady Palms. Room service every few hours, free alcohol, free food, the whole nine yards basically. I had already been there a few days, enjoying the bar and sitting out by the beach, soaking in the sun as the days melted away. Everything was \"normal\" or so it seemed anyways. Until I started paying attention to the workers, and when I noticed the workers, thats when it all fucking started going down hill. Their movements looked human enough, fluid, not any real jitteriness, but the manner in which they spoke was like they were trying too hard to to sound normal. The person who owned the building came up to me and said, \"You'd better take the hint that you should mind your own business, boy.\" That was all he said to me. So I obviously look into it more. Its about 10pm at this point in time so I leave my room and walk around what seemed to be endless hallways until I found the elevator, go inside and press \"basement\". That was the real first mistake I had made. The basement was not at all what I had expected to see as a basement. Red candles lined the walls and floors, there was an altar in the middle of a massive summoning circle. The walls were a dingy, stained and tattered yellow color. And around the summoning circle were all the workers, and at the altar, none other than the building owner himself speaking some kind of twisted latin\/german mix of language. Thats when my heart started racing. No one had seen me yet so I figured it was best that they didnt, so I tried to quietly just go back up to the lobby floor via the stairs and it probably would've worked too if the door didnt squeal when I opened it. Then immediate silence fell, I turned to look back at the altar in the middle of the room and there was the owner, inches from my face. He was sweaty, old, had an upside down cross burned into his chest and his eyes were solid black. Then in the deepest tone you could possibly imagine he said \"I thought I told you to mind your business, boy.\" Trying to escape was probably the worst thing to try at that moment, so I didnt even try to. I just stood there frozen in fear, knowing that I had fucked up horribly. I woke up back in my hotel room, or so I thought it was, but it wasnt the same as before. The walls were old, the wallpaper seemingly shedding itself from the walls. Rusted doors and door knobs, the mirror was shattered, but still in tact in the bathroom, which had been covered now in blood. It was dark, the only light coming through was the moon light through the steel grating on the windows, but that was enough to see that where I was wasn't the same building. It almost now had seemed as if it were an abandoned asylum. I had managed to find my phone lying in the floor with still a good amount of battery charge, 87%, so I turned my flashlight on. That was the second mistake. What I thought was a bed I had woken up on was actually rotting corpses, which now had explained the awfully putrid, but sweet smell in the room. I immediately started dry heaving, thinking to myself \"what the fuck happened for me to end up in this hell\" and then I remembered the owner. The owner was the the last person I remembered seeing before waking up in this hellish nightmare of a reality. His face was burned into my memory. I had to find a way out of here before I ended up discarding my previous meal from the horror in front of my eyes. I kept myself as far away from the pile of corpses while making my way towards the door. On the door read a note, \"It seems you're finally awake. In this room is a key, you must find it if you wish to make it out of here alive. This is just one of many tasks you must complete for the many different rooms. You have twelve hours.\" How long had I really been out? My phone couldn't display the date, and only function that was working was the flashlight. It could have been days, weeks maybe.\n\nSo began the timer, bright and red. Silent. The mirror on the wall distorted the numbers, making it difficult to make out how much time was actually left for me to make it out. The panic settled a bit, knowing I had time to make attempts at finding the key for the room, but one thing was still uncertain. The timer. Did it reset for each room? Or was it on going for the duration of all the rooms? Time was ticking, and I wasnt going to find out by wallowing in my fear. My first instict of searching was obviously the bodies, but how many were there? Clearly enough to make a decent sized pile of them, it had to be at least 20 of them. They were rotting, mushy bits of flesh at this point. I figured this would be the worst of the rooms, due to it being how I woke up, but assuming so was the third mistake. This was just the beginning of something much, much more sinister.\n\nI pulled the collar of my shirt up over my nose and slowly made my way towards the pile of bodies, setting my phone on the rusty, steel table next to them. The room layout was exactly that of the luxury room I had been staying in, so if the bodies wasnt the key location, the rest would've been rather simple to rummage through. I hesitantly reached out to grab an arm of a body closest to me, finally grabbing onto it. I pulled slowly, gagging as the skin ripped away from flesh, as if it were melting at the touch. I immediately let go and turned around to unfortunately remove the previous meal I had eaten from my stomach. The bodies were a last resort now, because there was no way in hell I was searching through them first just to not find the key in that mix of flesh and rot. The next logical area to search was the bathroom, which would have been a better place to start. But opening that bathroom door was the fourth mistake. As I opened the door, a quick blast of air and heat rushed out into the room, further inducing the rotting of the corpses. It was nearly unbearable with my shirt over my nose, and the heat only made it worse. The smelled started to intensify, filling the room quickly as the mix of now sulfur and rotting flesh entangled themselves through my nostrils. The toilet was overflowing with thick, black liquid, slowly dripping onto the floor. It had the viscosity of oil, but purely from the smell alone, I could tell it was not at all. The mirror of the bathroom was intact enough to look at my face. I had noticed a cut made into my shoulder, poorly stitched and bruised around it. Looking down at it now, I could see the faintest bulge underneath my skin. It was roughly two inches in length, made a circle on one end of it, and had a half inch prong on the opposite end. I had found the key. It was surgically embedded into my shoulder. I had the key the entire time. The adrenaline coursed through my entire body, as well as the realization of what I had to do to retrieve the key. The risk of infection was drastically high, but its a risk I had to take if I had any intentions of making it out of this hell alive.\n\nI looked back into the mirror, hastily grabbing a shard of glass from what was left of it and gritted my teeth. I took the finest point, slowly pushing it into my skin around the outline of the key. I let out a loud scream as the pain soared through my torso, watching the blood pour its way down my arm. The glass shard easily sliced through my skin, deep and stinging as I pulled down, cutting and tearing through the makeshift stitches as my muscles twitched and jerked from the sheer pain. The key slowly showed itself from underneath my skin, just poking through the wound. I ripped a piece of my shirt off, wrapped it up and placed it in my mouth, biting down as I stuck my finger into the wound and pulled my the key from my shoulder, letting out a muffled groan as the pain nearly made me faint). The blood had soaked through my shirt and was dripping onto the floor, mixing with the horrible smells from everything else, masked amongst them. I took the piece of shirt from my mouth and pressed it hard onto the wound on my shoulder, hoping to stop the blood soon so I could leave this room and continue my escape from this hellish nightmare.\n\nThe timer read: 11:23:17. 37 minutes had elapsed from the time I had noticed it on the wall. 37 minutes to locate the key, and retrieve it. All while trying to mentally cope with the situation I had woken up to, with the pile of bodies, the hot and putrid bathroom which I had spent more than 20 minutes in now and was sweating profusely. I managed to stop the bleeding on my shoulder, which meant it was time to test the key. I made my way towards the locked door, trying not to stumble over the mass amounts of flesh, glass, and other various hazards strewn across the room. The door looked as if someone had tried to escape the room prior to my existence in this nightmare, this hell.. whatever you could call this room. Fingernail marks traced the length of it, from the middle section down to the floor, signs of a desperate fight seemingly with no real way out. I grabbed hold of the knob and slowly brought the key up to the keyhole, inserting it into the lock. Surprisingly, it was just that easy as the lock rotated with the twist of the key. I pushed the door, the feeling of resistance as something pushing or blocking the door from opening. So I pushed harder, slowly increasing the gap peering into the black hallway only broken up by a red strobe every few seconds. \n\nWhat could be made up of the hallway was only just railings, walls, and walkways with doors randomly placed about the length of the corridors, no real order or organization to any of it. I took a few minutes to recover myself, trying to forget the horrors of my previous room, gagging at the thought of the rotten bodies I had been laying on. \"I don't have time to sit around and just wait, I have to keep moving...\" I thought to myself before choosing a direction and just going. I went left from the door, cautiously taking my steps as the slideshow of red illuminated my eyes every so often. Nothing seemed to be getting closer with each strobe of the light as I walked the hall, the doors seemingly dancing on the walls as some looked closer than others for a brief moment. I stuck my hand to the wall as I walked to feel any kind of difference from the grimy, tattered wallpaper that I could vaguely make out. It must've felt like an hour in that hallway before eventually feeling the corner of a wall and it leading down a pitch black corridor with a small green light at the end. I stared down the hall, the feeling of dread overtaking my body as I stared at the green light in the void, but knew I had to get there. I started walking down the hallway, only keeping my eyes on the green salvation at the end. The silence was deafening, only hearing my feet beneath me on what felt like a lot of metal grating. The light was getting bigger with each step, my dread turning into hope, I started to run towards this light as if it was the only way to end this misery. The wall ended abruptly, the sound of my feet against the metal flooring echoing out. The hall had become a room. An empty room with a single green light, this time vaguely showing the outline of what seemed to be a door, but was too far away to make out. I stopped to listen as the echos wavered off into nothingness, listening for anything to give me a sign if where I was. I could only hear my heartbeat. I looked around the dark room now for anything showing something to reference any kind of depth, but it was all just black. I looked back towards the light, only to notice the light had changed color. It was no longer green, but a hazy kind of orange, almost looking like a light burning out. And that's when I heard it. It wasnt my heartbeat I was hearing. It was footsteps. They were getting louder, faster and quickly coming towards me. I bolted for the hazy light, as that same deep voice called out \"You haven't learned, have you boy?\"\n\n(I am actively adding to this story, updates should be sooner rather than later.

He'd fallen asleep in class.. again. His teacher, Miss Lawrence, was looking at him with slight exasperation. Her red locks bobbed  as she shook her head, sighing slightly as she continued the lecture. Something about old tunnels going underneath the city, no longer used.\n\n-There's been several kids, youths and even a pair of hikers going missing around those entrences these last few years\nShe was saying\n-They're not safe, steer clear\n\nWould I frame it any differently if I wanted a bunch of kids to go risk their lives exploring ruins? No? Definitely not. Samuel thought\n\n-I want those assignments on my desk by Monday\nMiss Lawrence finished\n\n\n-Hey, Sam!\n\nFred, school boxing prodigy and all-round good guy, called out, catching up to Sam\n\n-You gotta stop dozing off like that, your grades are gonna suffer\n\n-Yeah I know.. It's just so hard to keep my eyes open..\n\n-What's up, anyways? You got a new girl you haven't told me about?\n\nHe asked teasingly\n\n-Now that'd be a nice problem to have.. no, it's my damned nightmares. They're back.\n\n-Is it the same ones? Those from when we were kids?\n\nSam had been cursed with horrible night terrors when he was younger\n\n-Yeah, they stopped eight years ago. Around the time Sarah was born\n\n-I remember.. they were bad.. like, really bad, right?\nFred sounded concerned\n-Yeah, they were bad. But I was a kid, I'm handling it better now. Sleep's still suffering though\nSam pouted\n-Is it the same dark enteties? The.. shadow people and tentacles?\nFred asked\n-Yeah.. I'm surprised you remember\n-With your descriptions of the dreams you pretty much gave me the same nightmares, fairly memorable..\nFred chuckled\n-Yeah, sorry about that.. but talking about this ain't gonna solve anything\nSamuel didn't want to spend his waking hours obsessing about the things harassing him in his sleep, he'd rather enjoy having a break from it.\n\nFred sensed Sam's reluctance to dwell on it\n-Talking is for girls and old people\nFred slapped Sam's arm\n-See you at practice?\nHe asked\n-You bet\nSam tried sounding more enthusiastic than he was.\n\n-\n\nA few hours, and several bruises later, Sam was sitting out in his garden, or rather his grandmother's garden. His grandpa died a couple years back, his parents some time after his sister was born. Car accident. The grass felt nice under his legs as he held a lotus position, the wind breezing over his face.\n\n-Watch'a doing?\n\nAn extremely annoying voice chirped up\n\n-Meditating. Same as last time I was sitting here. And the time before that.\n\n-Watcha' doing that for?\nSarah asked\n\nShe loved to find new ways to annoy Sam, currently it was asking questions she already knew the answer to, Sam held it together for a time, but after a week it was getting on his nerves\n\n-To get away from you, scram!\n\nSam snapped at her, using his entire body for emphasis. She properly scrammed, with a pleased giggle. She'd gotten what she wanted out of the exchange. Sam sighed and went back to meditating.\n\nMeditation was touted by Sean O'Connely, the boxing coach at Sam and Fred's school, Eastleigh High. \"An iron body only gets you so far, you'll need the mental fortitude to match. Meditation is key to get that edge\" he'd tout. Fred had taken it to heart, and he had a knack for it. Sam supposed it helped that his mind seemingly was empty half the time..\n\nSam felt a buzz in his pocket, he took out his phone. It's a text from Alyssa in the group chat\n\n*You guys ready?\nIt read\n\n*Shit, that was today?!?\nFred responded\n\n*I'll bring snacks\nHenri chimed in, always prepared for pretty much any situation, no matter how unlikely\n\n*Yeah, usual spot in 15?\nSam typed\n\n\nAlyssa, one year senior the rest of us, had a bit of an obsession with the occult. Well, obsession is a bit harsh, but she's fascinated by it, researching it, buying various trinkets and so on. She found some fortune-teller or medium on craigslist, and she badgered the rest of us to join her on an expedition there.\n\nApproximately 15 minutes later I approached the diner slash convince store named Shop'N'Stop, Fred and Henri already waiting by the shabby, faded exterior of the place who couldn't make its mind up about what it was. The shop is alright, got the necessities at a reasonable price, the diner on the other hand.. Only one who haven't been running to the toilet for a week after eating there is Alyssa, and it's hardly fair to count her since she's some kind of freak of nature when it comes to dodging sickness, and most other bad things really.\n\n-Then, where's our heroine, dragging us out at this ungodly hour, to do God knows what, with forces and powers beyond our comprehension to understand, let alone witness?\nSam waxed sarcastically at the two in greeting. Henri chuckled and adjusted his glasses, while Fred smiled and looked behind Sam\n\n-T'was three hours before midnight, sun's last rays still sparkling. Hardly an ungodly hour\nA playful voice behind Sam said. He turned around and sew her, auburn hair playing lightly in the slight wind, eyes glimmering an emerald green in the last rays of the sun, set over the barely visible freckles dotting her nose and cheekbones.\n\nSam's heart skipped a beat upon seeing her, as it was prone to do these last few years. Growing up together their relationship has been that of a sibling one, albeit less annoying than the one Sam enjoyed with his actual sister. Puberty and maturing into adulthood didn't take that into account, and Sam was hard pressed to not notice the absolute beauty Alyssa was growing into.\n\n-Considering our mission this evening, anything after noon is an ungodly hour\nHenri chirped in. Despite being the only staunch non-believer in the group, he was the most easily frightened of the bunch\n\n-Wouldn't be you if you weren't the last one here\nSam smiled at Alyssa in greeting\n\nFred came up to us and put his arms around our shoulders\n-Alright birdies, let's get a move on. I've got a pizza with my name on it at home. It's very impatient, can't wait to see the insides of my stomach\n\nWe got moving, going towards the older parts of town, the Shop'N'Stop marking the end of the newer, better maintained parts of town. \n\nHenri glanced around nervously\n-So where'd you say you found this guy? Or woman? Or whatever?\nHe asked\n-Woman\nAlyssa responded\n-Found her on craigslist, she's a bit expensive but I think it's worth it. I've only tried cheap mediums so far, and the price really reflected the quality of their work..\nShe huffed, looking slightly annoyed, then she turned to the group and beamed towards them\n-Good thing I got you guys to share the fee with\nHenri huffed incredulously\n-You mean you badgered us until we finally agreed to do what you want?\n-I'm not forcing anyone to be here\nShe responded innocently\nFred looked to Henri\n-Hey, you let her talk you into this, no use complaining about it now\nHe said, not able to completely hide the slight tone of defeat in his own voice.\n\n-I'm actually looking forward to this\nSam interjected\n-Not that I believe this is anything but a scam, but I'd say it's worth 50 bucks for one evenings worth of entertainment, I'm curious to figure out what kind of tricks she'll use to try and trick us..\n\n-Alright guys, that's enough\nAlyssa said, looking at us, brow slightly furrowed\n-I want to do this with you, but if you're going to crap all over it before you've even tried it you're just gonna ruin it, for me, for you, for everyone. Just have an open mind\nShe looked at us pleadingly\n-Alright\nSam looked at her\n-The final reason I think this'll be worth 50 of my hard earned dollars is that on the off chance that this is real, I'd pay that sum several times over\nAlyssa's entire being lit up as she smiled at Sam\n-That's the spirit, look, we're almost there\nShe said, pointing towards a house in the distance\n\n-Samuel\n-zzt..fffzzZzz -static-\n-SAMUEL\n\nThe scream echoed in Samuels ears. His balance was off, the world shaking. No, not the world. Fred is shaking Sam.\n-Where'd you go buddy?\nFred asked, looking Sam in the eyes. Sam looked to Alyssa, trying to get his bearings, worry written all over her face, rarely seen wrinkles making an appearance on her face. Henri alternating glances at me and the ground, fidgeting with something in his hands. \n\n-I.. I don't... There was something.. over there\nSam said, pointing towards the side of an old, dilapidated house, overgrown weeds all over the lawn and house itself. The dizziness was starting to pass\n\n-There was a shadow. Something moved, I got all dizzy.. It's gone now\n\nFred looked really worried now\n-Shadow? Like in your dreams?\nHe asked\n\n-It's fine, just the sleep deprivation doing a number on me, I can handle it\nSam responded, now a bit anxious that his dreams might be slipping into his waking psyche\n\n-We can do this another time, if you need to go home and rest\nAlyssa chimed in, worry still apparent on her face. She'd been looking forward to this for several weeks, she's always put her friends wellbeing above her own interest, Sam really didn't want to let her down\n\n-It's fine, I'm feeling much better already\nHe lied\n\n-Here, take this\nHenri reached out a hand with a piece of something edible, meant to raise the blood sugar of those with diabetes, Sam crunched down on it and smiled towards the group\n-Good as new, let's do this\nHe said with a forced smile\nThey looked unconvinced, but agreed\n\n-This is it\nAlyssa said, looking at the very same dilapidated house\n-Only one thing left to do then\nSam said with much more bravado than he felt, a sense of dread growing in him as he marched up towards the overgrown house..."},"576":{"title":"Please Don't Play the Mr Blinky Wink Game","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbnmih\/please_dont_play_the_mr_blinky_wink_game\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Roos85","selftext":"I played a game last night called Mr Blinky Wink.

The skinny NikocadoAvocado is not the real him. I mean when I first saw the skinny NikocadoAvocado I couldn't believe it, and the transformation was rather miraculous. I was so happy for him that he lost weight, because it was looking rather unhealthy for him with the amount of food he was eating. I have seen his videos and that amount he was eating and doing silly stuff and I never really found it hilarious, but rather more concerning. So to see him all of a sudden skinny from being so over weight, it was incredible. \n\nI was in disbelief though and something about his extreme weight loss seemed too unreal. I was going with AI technology being used to make himself look skinny, and these days anyone can transform themselves to look like something they clearly are not. Any way I kind of put those thoughts behind me as I assumed those were negative thoughts. I should be happy that NikocadoAvocado has truly lost some weight.

After a few rough years, I needed a place where I could settle down, focus on my work, and maybe even meet some new people. The neighborhood seemed perfect quiet, clean, and close to the city but with a small-town vibe. The apartment itself was just right, a cozy one-bedroom with big windows that let in plenty of light. It felt like a place where I could finally breathe again.\n\nI spent the first few days getting settled, unpacking boxes, and arranging furniture. Everything was going smoothly, and for the first time in a long while, I felt at peace. The neighbors seemed friendly, though I hadn’t interacted much with them yet. I’d pass them in the hallway or see them in the courtyard, always offering a polite smile or a nod, which they returned. It was the kind of place where people kept to themselves but were still neighborly.\n\nBut something was off, even from the beginning. At first, I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, just a vague sense of unease that would wash over me at odd moments. It was nothing concrete, just the feeling that something wasn’t right.\n\nIt started small, little things that were easy to dismiss. I’d run into a neighbor on the stairs or in the hallway, and they’d smile and say hello, but later, when I tried to recall the encounter, I couldn’t remember what they looked like. Their faces seemed to blur in my memory, as if they were out of focus in a photograph. I shrugged it off, blaming it on the stress of the move, the newness of the place. After all, I was bad with faces to begin with.\n\nBut as the days went on, the feeling of unease grew stronger.\n\nOne evening, about a week after I’d moved in, I had an unsettling experience that I couldn’t shake. I was coming back from a late-night grocery run when I ran into one of my neighbors in the lobby. She was an older woman, with gray hair pulled back into a bun, dressed in a simple floral dress. She smiled at me, and we exchanged pleasantries.\n\n“Late night?” she asked.\n\n“Yeah,” I replied, holding up the grocery bag. “Needed a few things.”\n\nShe nodded, her smile warm but…odd. Something about her smile didn’t seem quite right. It was too wide, too perfect, as if it were pasted onto her face.\n\n“Well, good night,” she said, and I mumbled a good night in return as I headed towards the elevator.\n\nAs I rode up to my floor, I tried to picture her face again, but it was a struggle. Her features were already slipping away, melting into an indistinct blur. By the time I reached my apartment, I could barely remember what she looked like at all.\n\nThat night, I had trouble sleeping. My dreams were filled with shadowy figures, their faces hidden in darkness, watching me, whispering in voices I couldn’t understand. I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, the images from the dream lingering in my mind.\n\nThe next morning, I decided to shake off the unease. It was just a dream, I told myself. The move had probably thrown me off more than I realized. I needed to get out, take a walk, clear my head.\n\nI grabbed my jacket and headed out. As I walked through the courtyard, I saw a few of my neighbors sitting on benches, reading or chatting quietly. I waved to one of them, a man in his thirties with dark hair, and he waved back with that same odd, too-wide smile.\n\nI kept walking, but the feeling of unease only grew stronger. There was something wrong with the way they moved, the way they looked at me. I glanced over my shoulder and saw that they were still watching me, their faces turned towards me, their eyes blank and expressionless.\n\nI hurried out of the courtyard, trying to shake off the fear that was creeping up my spine. Maybe it was just paranoia, I told myself. Maybe I was letting my imagination get the better of me.\n\nBut as the days went on, the strange encounters continued.\n\nI started avoiding my neighbors, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, keeping my head down when I walked through the courtyard. But no matter how much I tried to avoid them, they were always there, watching me with those unsettling smiles.\n\nOne evening, I was sitting in my apartment, trying to focus on some work, when I caught my reflection in the window. For a moment, I didn’t recognize myself. My face looked pale and drawn, my eyes sunken and hollow. I shook my head, trying to clear the fog from my mind. It was just stress, I told myself. I needed to get a grip.\n\nBut the next time I looked in the mirror, I noticed something that sent a chill down my spine. My features were…fading. It was subtle at first, barely noticeable, but there was no mistaking it. The lines of my face seemed softer, less distinct, as if they were being erased, bit by bit.\n\nI stared at my reflection, my heart pounding. Was I losing my mind? Was this some kind of hallucination? I splashed water on my face, hoping to snap out of it, but when I looked in the mirror again, the fading was still there, even more pronounced than before.\n\nThe fear that had been gnawing at the edges of my mind now took hold, gripping me with icy fingers. I had to know what was happening. I had to find out the truth about this place, about my neighbors, about myself.\n\nI started asking around, trying to get information about the building and its residents, but I hit a wall at every turn. No one seemed to know much about the place, and those who did were evasive, giving me vague answers and avoiding eye contact. It was as if the entire neighborhood was in on some kind of secret, one they weren’t willing to share.\n\nMy anxiety grew with each passing day. My reflection continued to fade, and I became more and more isolated, avoiding everyone, even my friends and family. I couldn’t let them see what was happening to me, couldn’t explain it without sounding insane.\n\nThe final straw came one night when I woke up to a sound in my apartment, a soft, shuffling noise, like someone was moving around in the darkness. My heart leaped into my throat as I sat up, straining to listen. The sound was coming from the hallway, just outside my bedroom door.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight from my nightstand and crept out of bed, my hands trembling. As I approached the door, the noise stopped, and an eerie silence filled the room. I hesitated, my hand hovering over the doorknob, fear rooting me in place.\n\nFinally, I mustered the courage to open the door. The hallway was dark, the only light coming from the faint glow of the streetlamp outside. I shone the flashlight down the corridor, but there was nothing there. No sign of anyone or anything.\n\nBut as I turned to go back to bed, I caught sight of something that made my blood run cold, footprints. Wet footprints, leading from the front door down the hallway and stopping right outside my bedroom.\n\nI followed the trail, my heart racing, and when I reached the front door, I found it slightly ajar. Someone had been inside my apartment, and they had left without making a sound.\n\nI locked the door, every nerve in my body on high alert. I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out, had to leave before whatever was happening to me became irreversible.\n\nBut as I turned to gather my things, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the hallway mirror, and what I saw nearly brought me to my knees.\n\nMy face was almost completely gone. My features had smoothed over, leaving only a blank, featureless surface where my eyes, nose, and mouth should have been. I stared at the reflection, horror coursing through me, but the face that stared back was no longer mine.\n\nIn a panic, I ran out of the apartment, fleeing down the stairs and into the night. I didn’t stop until I was far from the building, gasping for breath, my mind reeling.\n\nI had to leave, had to get as far away from this place as possible. But where could I go? How could I escape something that was happening to me from the inside out?\n\nIn desperation, I found a hotel on the other side of town and checked in, hoping that distance would break the hold the apartment seemed to have on me. I locked myself in the room and avoided mirrors, too afraid of what I might see.\n\nBut the next morning, when I looked in the bathroom mirror, the horror was still there. My face was now completely blank, just a smooth, featureless surface staring back at me. I was becoming one of them, one of the faceless ones.\n\nI had to stop it. I had to find a way to reverse whatever had been done to me before it was too late.\n\nI spent the next few days researching frantically, poring over old records, news articles, anything I could find about the building and the neighborhood. The deeper I dug, the more disturbing the information became.\n\nThe neighborhood wasn’t cursed, as I’d initially feared, it was something else, something far more terrifying. The apartment complex had been the site of an experiment, decades ago, one that had gone horribly wrong. It had been a psychological study, conducted in secret, where residents were unknowingly subjected to extreme isolation and sensory deprivation.\n\nThe experiment had been shut down after multiple residents were driven mad or simply disappeared. But the effects lingered, a residual force that still permeated the walls of the building. Over time, the neighborhood itself became infected with this presence, warping the reality of anyone who lived there too long.\n\nThe faceless ones were the remnants of those who had succumbed to the experiment, their identities stripped away, their minds hollowed out until they were nothing more than empty shells. They were still alive, in a sense, but without faces, without memories, without selves. They were the perfect subjects, eternally trapped in the aftermath of the experiment.\n\nAnd now, I was becoming one of them.\n\nI didn’t have much time. The more I thought about it, the more I could feel the presence creeping into my mind, unraveling the threads of who I was, who I had been. My memories were slipping away, and with them, my sense of self. I had to find a way to escape this fate, to reclaim my identity before it was too late.\n\nIn my research, I found references to a man who had survived the experiment, one of the original residents who had managed to escape before it claimed him. He was now living as a recluse, far from the city, trying to put the horrors of the past behind him.\n\nDesperate, I tracked him down, hoping he might have the answers I needed.\n\nI found him living in a small, dilapidated cabin on the edge of a forest, far from civilization. He was an old man now, frail and worn, but his eyes were sharp, filled with a haunted knowledge. He listened as I told him my story, nodding slowly, as if he had been expecting me.\n\n“You can’t escape it,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “Not completely. But you can fight it. You can reclaim yourself.”\n\nHe told me that the only way to resist the effects of the experiment was to reconnect with who I was, my memories, my identity, my essence. I had to anchor myself in the reality of who I was before the experiment could take it all away.\n\nHe handed me an old journal, his own from the days when he had been a resident in that cursed building. It was filled with notes, memories, and thoughts, his way of holding on to himself during the experiment. He urged me to do the same, to write down everything I could remember about myself, to hold on to those memories as if my life depended on it.\n\nBecause it did.\n\nI returned to the hotel and began writing furiously, trying to capture every memory, every detail about my life before it all faded away. It was exhausting, mentally and emotionally, but I felt the presence weakening with each word I wrote. The more I focused on my identity, the less power it had over me.\n\nBut the battle wasn’t over. The faceless ones knew I was fighting back, and they weren’t going to let me go so easily.\n\nThat night, as I was writing, I heard the shuffling footsteps again, this time inside the hotel room. My heart pounded as I turned to face the mirror, and there they were, standing behind me, their featureless faces reflecting back at me, their blank eyes staring into mine.\n\nThey reached out with their hands, but this time, I was ready. I clutched the journal to my chest, refusing to let them take me. I focused on my memories, on the life I had lived, on the person I was.\n\nAnd then, in a moment of clarity, I spoke my name out loud, my voice firm and resolute.\n\n“I am \\[Your Name\\]. I am not one of you.”\n\nThe faceless ones hesitated, their hands faltering, and in that moment, I felt a surge of strength, of self. I pushed back against their presence, forcing them out of the room, out of my mind.\n\nThey disappeared, vanishing into the darkness, and I collapsed onto the bed, exhausted but victorious.\n\nI knew then that I had won, that I had reclaimed myself from the grip of the experiment. My reflection in the mirror was my own again, my features clear and distinct. I was whole, and I would remain that way, as long as I held on to my memories, to my identity.\n\nI left the city the next morning, leaving the apartment, the neighborhood, and the faceless ones behind. I would never return, but I would carry the journal with me always, a reminder of who I was and what I had fought to preserve.\n\nBecause in a world where identity can be stolen, where memories can be erased, holding on to oneself is the greatest victory of all."},"579":{"title":"Not Your Father's Creepy Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbvq41\/not_your_fathers_creepy_story\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"SoftFaithlessness460","selftext":"It was dark this night, the darkest it had ever been. The moon had eclipsed the sun, black and heavy clouds blanketed the sky above me and just as I stepped out of my Impala, the rain came crashing down. In a matter of a few seconds, I was thoroughly soaked. \n\n\n\"At least my destination is ' round this next alley corner. I\"ll be safe there.\" I whisper to myself. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw as I entered the diner.... Blood... lots of blood... Every surface I could see was covered in an impossible amount of blood... Where did it come from? I could see no bodies, couldn't find even a hint of dead flesh. Slowly, I moved through the diner, quietly heading for the  kitchen. When I was barely 2 feet in front of it, the door swung inward, against its very own hinges and what greeted me was beyond words at that moment... \n\n\nI turned away, trying desparately not to throw up, and give myself time to allow my uncomprehending mind to register what I had just seen... When I finally composed myself, I looked again. Dozens of bodies in varying states of dismal dismemberment and decay littered the kitchen floors and counters, the smell of rot permeated the air, and the worst of it all... My fiancé and our young daughter were just in front of me, posed in a grotesque work of art... Hoping that this was merely a nightmare, I pinched myself as hard as I could, causing blood to pool. Unable and unwilling to believe this reality, I called my Fiancé's phone as I fell to my knees... The phone rang, as it did, I knew... After all, I could hear it all too well, her favorite song and ringtone Family Table by Zac Brown Band. I fell to the floor beside them... I don't know how long I laid there. Hours? Days maybe?\n\n\nWhen the local cops finally showed up, they found me despondent and curled up next to the grotesque human art and didn't know whether I was a victim or the killer. When they tried taking me away, apparently I punched and kicked anyone who came near me. It took their six toughest military vets to get me in the police car... At the station, whatever questions were asked, I never heard... I still don't understand what I found that day, only thing I know is I can't go on like this. Not long after that, death came for me...\n\n\nTo whomever finds and reads this letter, you are now marked.

She had complications from surgeries that led to infections. Round and round to the ER and back home. Eventually it was bad enough that they hospitalized her and sent her to a larger Hospital about an hour and a half away. The hospital in town is big enough.. although we have seen our fair share medical incompetence resulting in the deaths of at least four family members. Within the immediate family, we weren't prepared to take any chances so we were glad they admitted that she needed better care.\n\nI made these grueling 2-hour drives from town out to the major city. First it starts with a smaller Highway that leads to a very tiny town. The off ramp turns into a well cared for two lane road. The road cuts through Hills of cornfield, up and down over the horizon for about 25 minutes before the road ends up at a major highway.\n\nIt's fun when you're a passenger. You can stare off into the corn and watch the closer stalks move faster than the corn off in the distance.  The corn does a chaotic dance and then eventually fall back into line forming straight cornrows, transforming into geometric patterns and eventually back into what appears to be chaotically placed corn stalks again.  I wasn't afforded these thoughts on the drive. All I could think about was my mom.\n\nMy 38th birthday was a bust. It doesn't all have to be about me but it was sad celebrating my birthday alone with my mom in the hospital, the family distracted about her. Not to mention work was pushing me over the limit. I wasn't getting any sleep and this drive was particularly hard on me.\n\nI took the Old Highway out to that Tiny Town and was driving up and down the cornfields and around the bends at 55 mph. Suddenly a notification rang out on my phone, so I picked it up and had a quick glance.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say. That's super irresponsible! I would normally agree for an average person, but myself? No. When I was much younger, I would go to the grocery store and buy a glass bottle of coca-cola. I would balance the bottle upside down on my index finger, feeling the wait, making sure it stays upright. I dropped and shattered plenty of drinks before I mastered being able to balance a drink upside down on my finger. So I mean to say, I was juggling glass bottles before I was juggling cars and cell phones.\n\nThe lack of sleep has been getting to me. I stared at a message regarding my mom in the hospital and had a second of microsleep. I looked up and I had drifted into the oncoming Lane with a large truck head on. I crashed head first into it.\n\nI don't know the physics of it but the seat belt broke under my weight and the front and ripped apart. The last thing I remembered was bouncing sideways onto the road before everything went dark. Faster than snapping your fingers I was momentarily disoriented, back in the car several seconds prior with my cell phone in my hand. I looked up, saw the oncoming truck, and simply pulled the steering wheel to the right avoiding the accident.\n\nI had to stop the car to process what just happened. Did I dream that? Did I die? What the hell just happened!\n\nI arrived to the hospital, found some family there, and immediately tried to tell them what I just experienced. An odd expression came over my brother's face and he loudly talked over me changing the subject. I tried to talk with someone else and it happened again. Later on I tried talking with a third family member who actually heard me out. In the end though he laughed and suggested that I'm probably still going to text and drive. Nobody heard me out.\n\nI don't know if it's social media spying on me or an internet algorithm but I've been seeing these videos on social media talking about Quantum immortality and how it's possible that when someone dies from their perspective it was just a dream. I wonder if it's the same thing that happened to me.\n\nTrue story BTW"},"583":{"title":"A story to test your fears ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbqpz1\/a_story_to_test_your_fears\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"sir_mr_mistery40","selftext":"Enjoy the story of a man who gets a new house with a secret.

The show was called \"Momo’s Fantastic Show.\"\n\nNo one truly knows when or where it was produced. There are no official records—no television archives, no newspaper clippings, no mentions in databases or libraries. The only trace of its existence is a set of audio tapes, purportedly the soundtrack of the show, recovered by an anonymous investigator and shared in the dark recesses of the internet.\n\nThe show, according to the few who have heard of it, was strange and erratic in nature.The main character was a sun—an enormous, smiling sun in a mascot costume—who appeared in every episode. However, this was not a warm, welcoming sun; it was one that seemed to hide something dark behind its frozen smile.\n\nThe set and the recordings have disappeared, along with everyone involved in the production. According to rumors, all the crew members who worked on the show vanished without a trace, overnight. The studio was left deserted, equipment abandoned mid-production. Even the sun, the central character of the show, simply vanished as if it had never existed.\n\nThe only thing left behind, the only testament to what \"Momo’s Fantastic Show\" was, is its soundtrack.\n\nI have tried to reconstruct these tapes with a seemingly joyful sound.\n\n"},"585":{"title":"Hotel Room 714","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbsioy\/hotel_room_714\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"CreepyStoriesJR","selftext":"Hello, here's an original creepy story about a Room that might not exist!\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lsPSGmnqd98](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lsPSGmnqd98)"},"586":{"title":"Kentucky fried chicken ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fbs5tn\/kentucky_fried_chicken\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I got a family sized Kentucky fried chicken bucket.

My parents owned a small restaurant, and we lived in a modest back room where we all slept together in one bed—my parents, my sister, and me.\n\nOne night, I woke up needing to use the restroom. As I groggily rubbed my eyes, something caught my attention in the corner of the room. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, so I blinked hard, trying to clear the crust from my eyes. But when I looked again, I saw it clearly—a figure, crouched and staring at me from the shadows.\n\nPanic surged through me. I wanted to run back to the safety of the bed, but I couldn’t move. My body was frozen in place, paralyzed by fear. The figure, which looked almost human, began to rise and walk toward me. Each step it took sent a wave of terror through my body, but still, I couldn’t move.\n\nAs it drew closer, I finally managed to break free from my fear. I lunged onto the bed, frantically trying to wake my family, but they wouldn’t budge. It was as if they were in a deep, unnatural sleep. Desperate, I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping it would all go away.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I found myself sitting on the edge of the bed. My mother was awake, standing next to me, staring at the humanoid figure. They didn’t speak, just looked at each other in silence. Gathering all my courage, I got up and walked around the thing. I reached out and pushed it—it felt slick, almost slimy, like its skin or clothes were coated in something. Its skin was a sickly gray, but no matter how hard I try, I can never remember its face.\n\nAfter I pushed it, my mother finally spoke. She simply said, \"He won’t bother you again.\" And just like that, the figure was gone.

When we’re kids, we often do silly things out of boredom. It’s normal. But sometimes, when these games go too far, the consequences can be much worse than we expect.\n\nIn the quiet town of Miller’s Grove, two kids one day got very bored and naturally decided to play a game—a simple, fun game that everyone has probably played. I’m sure you did too. It’s called Tag, you’re it!\n\n‘Jack, let’s play a game,’ Emma said, full of energy and enthusiasm.\n\n‘Sure, Emma. What game?’ Jack asked.\n\n‘Tag, you’re it!’ Emma replied with a giggle, excited to play.\n\nJack, being a curious and energetic boy, wondered how it was played. Instead of an explanation, he received a poke on the shoulder followed by a ‘Tag, you’re it!’ Emma then ran toward the backyard, and Jack figured he should follow.\n\nAs Emma was running away from Jack, she found herself cornered. In the tension of the moment, she acted on instinct, jumping over the fence and heading for the main street. Jack followed her and finally caught up on a hill they’d never been on before. They both took a minute to catch their breath and curiously looked to the other side of the hill.\n\n‘Wow!’ Jack exclaimed. ‘What’s that?’ He pointed towards an old mill in the distance.\n\n‘I don’t know, but it looks older than Grandpa Fane,’ Emma said.\n\n‘Let’s check it out,’ Jack suggested.\n\n‘But... but we shouldn’t. It’s...’\n\n‘Come on, Emma, do you have something better to do?’ Jack urged.\n\nEmma sighed and followed him to the mill. It seemed abandoned and didn’t have much of interest, but to them, it felt like the most exciting thing they’d seen all week.\n\nThey quickly grew bored of it and decided to explore their surroundings. They found more and more old, abandoned buildings each day, sneaking out to explore and coming back before their parents could catch them. Sometimes, they even lied, saying they were having a sleepover at the other’s house, just to go out at night. It became a hobby they eventually quit when there wasn’t much left to explore and the excitement had faded. Now, at fifteen and heading into high school, Emma and Jack, living in this quiet town forgotten by time, needed something. And Jack knew exactly what that was.”\n\nJack decided to call Emma to tell her about his plan.\n\n\"Hey Emma, are you awake?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jack. What do you want? It’s 3 a.m.,\" she replied, sounding annoyed.\n\n\"Remember that lake near the old mill we used to visit as kids?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what’s up with that? And why can’t this wait until morning?\"\n\n\"There’s a well on the other side of the lake, in the forest. Some guy told me it’s really creepy—he said it gave him a feeling of unease and tension. It’s probably even older than the mill. I thought you might like to check it out, just like in the old days.\"\n\n\"This is what you call me for at 3 a.m.? Seriously, Jack, grow up.\"\n\n\"But I thought it would be fun...\"\n\n\"Go to sleep, bro,\" she says, and hangs up\n\nThe next morning, Emma realized she had been too harsh with Jack. She felt guilty for her response, understanding that her bad mood had been influenced by the stress from school and her parents’ constant fighting. Reading horror stories, especially creepypasta about abandoned places, had always been her escape. She decided she should cut Jack some slack.\n\nShe called Jack, her voice softer this time. \"Hey Jack, I’m sorry for what I said last night. I’ve been dealing with a lot, and I took it out on you. But you know what? You’re right. It could be fun, just like old times. Let’s check out that place tonight.\"\n\nJack was taken aback. \"Wait, really? I didn’t expect this. What changed your mind?\"\n\nEmma took a deep breath, recalling their childhood adventures. \"You made me remember how much fun we had as kids, playing games and exploring every corner of this town—even at night, even when we were scared. It felt special, and I really miss that.\"\n\nJack’s voice softened with nostalgia. \"Me too, Emma. Sometimes I miss playing hide and seek by the lake. Back then, it was just the two of us and... David.\"\n\nEmma’s tone grew serious. \"Jack, we don’t talk about that anymore. The past is the past. We were kids; we couldn’t have done anything.\"\n\nJack sighed. \"I know, but sometimes I wonder if he’s still out there somewhere. We never even looked for him; we were too scared.\"\n\nEmma reassured him. \"Jack, the police looked everywhere. The town isn’t very big. They would have found him by now.\"\n\nJack nodded slowly. \"I guess you’re right. But we’ll still go to that well, right?\"\n\nEmma’s voice was determined. \"Yeah, damn right we will.\"\n\nAlright, that’s the spirit. So we’re doing it tonight?”\n\n“Yeah, see you tonight, bro.”\n\nJack was now very excited and also impatient. He couldn’t wait for tonight when they’d explore that well. He took a nap to help pass the time.\n\nWhen the phone rang, he woke up and answered. “Come on, Jack, are you ready?”\n\nMuttering in a sleepy voice, he replied, “I’ll be out in 10.”\n\nHe rapidly prepared and went out to meet his childhood friend. “Take this,” Emma said, handing him a flashlight. “It’s better than your phone’s.”\n\n“Wow, thanks,” he said gratefully.\n\nOn the way there, they only talked about their memories of previous visits in the area, not expecting anything out of the ordinary. They arrived at the well, and Jack held the flashlight above it so they could both peek inside.\n\nJack’s expression turned from curiosity to shock and terror. In the well, there was a distorted, macabre reflection that looked like them but had an odd grin, smiling wider than is humanly possible.\n\nBoth were left in utter shock, and as their adrenaline kicked in, they ran, trying to get out of the woods. Emma couldn’t keep her balance on the slippery mud and fell hard. Jack stopped to help her up. While he was doing that, Emma glanced back and saw the reflections closing in with that morbid smile. They ran again, not looking back because they were too afraid.\n\nThey gained some distance and Emma pointed at a wooden shack in the woods. “Let’s hide in there!” They ran inside and quietly sat down.\n\n“Oh my god, oh my god, Jack, please tell me you have signal here.”\n\n“You know damn well there’s no signal here,” Jack said, trying to stay calm. “Just calm down, okay? We’re safe here.”\n\n“What were those things, Jack? Who the hell told you about this place? This is insane!”\n\n“Some guy from my chemistry class. He’s a weirdo, but I didn’t think it would be a haunted well.”\n\nEmma panicked even more, sobbing in fear from the shock. Her knee was also bleeding from the fall. Jack was trying to remain calm, convincing himself that it was just a game—a kids' game of hide and seek.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud bang on the door, followed by a stronger hit that broke it. Both Jack and Emma, in complete shock and panic, found themselves face to face with their reflections once again. This time, the reflections spoke.\n\n“Hello, Jack. Hello, Emma. Imagine this as a game of tag, you’re it. Right now, we’re it, but soon enough, the roles will be reversed.”\n\nEmma broke the window and jumped out, acting on instinct just like when Jack first chased her. In an instant, Jack followed her. The reflections seemed to be slow but were certainly frightening.\n\nCreeped out and terrified, the two kids didn’t know which way to go. As they were checking their surroundings, Jack felt a hand on his shoulder and immediately jumped in fear. He turned around to see David.\n\nBoth, even more shocked than before, exclaimed in unison, “David?!”\n\n“Long time no see. These things that chased you have chased me as well. If they catch you, you’ll take their place in the well, and they’ll take your place in the real world.”\n\n“You’ve been here for almost 5 years? And how come they haven’t caught you?”\n\n“Well, they might be smart, but they aren’t very fast. Their weakness is light. If they come at you, use the flashlight to blind them.”\n\nThe reflections appeared again, and when the two kids turned their heads back to David, he was gone, as if he had never been there. They ran again, heading for the mill this time, but the reflections blocked their path, forcing them deeper into the woods, farther from the town. After hours of hiding and running back and forth, they were exhausted and confused. They ended up accidentally going back to the well and were cornered by the reflections.\n\nJack remembered what David had told them. “Emma, use the flashlight.”\n\n“Yeah, you’re right,” she said.\n\nAs Emma turned on the flashlight and pointed it at her reflection, it seemed affected. Then, unexpectedly, the reflection sprinted towards Emma and swapped places with her.\n\nJack screamed at the top of his lungs, “No, Emma!” But David had said it makes you weak.\nDavid once again appears\n“I lied, Jack. Don’t you get it? I’m not your David. I’m also a reflection.”\n\nNo, no, this can’t be,” Jack said, his voice breaking as he tried to comprehend the situation. Despite being powerless and exhausted, he made one last desperate run for escape. But his reflection was swift and caught up with him, taking his place as well.\n\nAnd so, this is the tragic ending of what began as a simple game for two kids who had a rough childhood and just wanted to relive the excitement of their youth. What had once been a hobby, abandoned as they grew older, returned for one final, fateful game of Tag, You’re It—one with the ultimate stakes: their lives.\n\nIn the cold, dark reality of the well, the echoes of Jack and Emma remained, their grinning reflections now inhabiting the world they once knew. The real Jack and Emma, trapped in the well, were left to confront the terrifying truth of their last, game.\n\n*THIS IS MY FIRST POST I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME FEEDBACK*"},"599":{"title":"Hello From an Old Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fat3ct\/hello_from_an_old_friend\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"LionFalse4295","selftext":"Have you ever had an old friend you chatted to on the internet that suddenly disappeared? Well, I did, and let's just say it was very... Interesting and sobering.\n\nSo, I used to live in Michigan in a neighborhood called Fulton Heights. I moved away from it when I was about 19 I think? Anyways, it was a very nice neighborhood and the people there were very friendly and respectful. Me and my family knew just about every person by name and by looks. Now that i'm talking about it, it was a very pleasant and nostalgic place. My favorite part about it was going with my family to see the fireworks at this community gathering thing we had. The whole sky would glow red, purple, orange, etc. It was amazing. Anyways, I'll stop dragging you on with the unneeded details of my life and I'll get to the important parts.\n\nSo I was about 15 when I got my first computer in 2007. I had saved up all my allowance and lawn mowing money to get it. It was a nice computer and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I can't imagine how much time I spent on it, just chatting in chat rooms, playing computer games, etc. Anyways, in one of the chat rooms, I made a friend. His username was very... Odd. It didn't seem too similar to the usual username back then. Most users were \"XxZaviorxX\" or \"M4ckenzie456\" or some other name that shouted \"Look at me! I'm cool!\". His user was \"HelloFri3nd\". It basically seemed like a user that someone or... Something, would make up to sound like \"one of the kids\" but it wasn't quite there. Anyways, me and HelloFri3nd would always play computer games together and chat pretty much every day after school. Most of the games we played were COD, TF2, Half-Life 2, stuff like that. It was fun, but.. Weird things would sometimes happen when we talked. Like, for example, one night I was talking to him after we just finished a round of TF2, and my computer would start glitching out or the lights would flicker, or he would starting talking weird. Here, I saved the conversation we had that night. See for yourself.\n\n\nNightOwl60: That was a good match\n\nHelloFri3nd: very good\n\nNightOwl60: O I gtg. It's getting really late and I got school in the morning.\n\nHelloFri3nd: No\n\nNightOwl60: ?\n\nHelloFri3nd: One more match\n\nNightOwl60: sorry dude I cant \n\nHelloFri3nd: just one more match. It will all be ok :)\n\nNightOwl60: I really gtg man\n\nHelloFri3nd: We r friends aren't we?\n\nNightOwl60: yea of course? \n\nHelloFri3nd: then stay on. \n\n\nAfter he said that, my computer started bugging out. It would literally flicker and those weird glitchy lines would jump around the screen. This lasted for about 6 seconds until a message was displayed on my screen. It said something along the lines of \"Let me in\" and it displayed an angry emoji face. It was incredibly confusing but I brushed it off since I thought it was just a simple bug. I then gave up and decided to just play one more match with HelloFri3nd to appease him. About 2 days later, another weird thing happened.\n\nThis time, it was after we finished playing Portal together. I decided to ask him where he came from, since it had been about 3 weeks since we started talking to eachother and it never crossed my mind to ask him. So, I did and he didn't really take it well. His grammar completely went down the gutter as he started telling me to not ask such things. I asked him why and he just completely dodged my questions. He said that it would be unsafe to share his location, which is understandable in most cases, but this one... This was strange. \n\nI decided to just brush it off and change the subject, since it seemed useless to try and get him to change his mind. The next day, I was having breakfast and thinking about what I would do after school with HelloFri3nd. Suddenly, my dad uttered an \"Oh jeez\" and sighed. I looked over at him and saw that he was reading a newspaper. I couldn't really see his expression since his face was half covered by the paper. I asked him what was up, and he shook the newspaper before setting it down on the table. Apparently 5 people went missing. 3 teens and 2 kids around the age of 11-12.\n\nI was shocked because barely any crime or anything serious happened in my neighborhood. My whole family was confused and shocked and we awaited some more news or details on the missing kids. We had nothing, no input or anything until I got home from school. My mom said that apparently the 5 people didn't just go missing suddenly all at once, but apparently they disappeared at the end of every hour, like a pattern. It didn't make sense, because the first kid would've gotten reported and then the next, but we got the news all at once in my Dad's paper.\n\nI was unnerved, but I went upstairs to play with HelloFri3nd to get my mind off things. Now, this is where EVERYTHING goes insane and where things get eerie. I saved this final conversation we had, so take a look. \n\n\nNightOwl60: Hey\n\nHelloFri3nd: hello I've been waiting to talk to you all day\n\nNightOwl60: Sorry, had a long day at school and I also heard that some kids went missing in my neighborhood. Spooky stuff\n\nHelloFri3nd: spooky indeed\n\nNightOwl60: Anyways, wanna play some TF2 or COD?\n\nHelloFri3nd: hm, let's play TF2 \n\nNightOwl60: alright!\n\n\nAfter we finished playing TF2:\n\n\nHelloFri3nd: we did awesome :)\n\nNightOwl60: Yea! We really carried the team ;)\n\nHelloFri3nd: ha ha ha \n\nHelloFri3nd: I have a question\n\nNightOwl60: alr what is it?\n\nHelloFri3nd: would it be ok if I visited you?\n\nNightOwl60: Uh... I don't know if that's a good idea\n\nHelloFri3nd: Why not?\n\nNightOwl60: Well my parents won't be ok with it and theyll feel unsafe.\n\nHelloFri3nd: oh, they don't have to worry about me. Im trustworthy cause im your friend :)\n\nNightOwl60: I know you're my friend but I don't think it's a good time right now\n\nHelloFri3nd: but I really wanna meet my BEST FRIEND face to face :)\n\nNightOwl60: Sorry dude it's not gonna happen\n\nHelloFri3nd: No\n\nNightOwl60: Wdym no?\n\nHelloFri3nd: Im going to visit you right now\n\nNightOwl60: you don't even know where I am\n\nHelloFri3nd: Yes i do. In fact, I've always known since we first became friends :)\n\nAt this moment, I was spooked, but I was also skeptical and I didn't fully believe him. \n\nNightOwl60: No u don't. There's no way?\n\nHelloFri3nd: yes there is. I have my ways :)\n\nNightOwl60: Dude, you're creeping me out. Pls stop.\n\nHelloFri3nd: y are you creeped out? I'm just your friend. I mean no harm :)\n\nNightOwl60: Please tell me you don't really know.\n\nHelloFri3nd: friends can't lie to eachother\n\nNightOwl60: There is no way you really know. \n\nHelloFri3nd: you live in Fulton Heights don't you?\n\nAs soon as he said that, i jumped away from my keyboard, nearly hitting my back on my bed frame. I've never felt so scared in my life. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest like it was gonna jump out of my mouth. I quickly got up and ran over to the keyboard to try and find a way to block HelloFri3nd.  My hands shook violently as I desperately searched for the block button like my life depended on it. I know it seems wimpy, but I was 15 at the time, and this was my first ever scary experience on the web. After I found the block button, I was about to click on it when I got a notification that HelloFri3nd messaged me again. I glanced over at the message bar and froze.\n\n\nHelloFri3nd: DON'T YOU DARE BLOCK ME\n\n\nHow in the everloving heck did he know I was about to block him!? I was frozen in fear at this point and I didn't know what to do. \n\n\nNightOwl60: What do you mean?\n\nHelloFri3nd: I saw what u were doing. You tried to block me. \n\nNightOwl60: How did you know?\n\nHelloFri3nd: I can see everything, friend. \n\nNightOwl60: How?? Are you hacking?\n\nHelloFri3nd: No. \n\nNightOwl60: There's no other possible way you could see what I'm doing.\n\nHelloFri3nd: yes there is. \n\nI felt nauseous as I looked back at the block button. I contemplated on just simply blocking him, but what if that didn't work? What if he found some other way to find me? Suddenly, another notification rang, and I looked down at the message bar again.  \n\n\nHelloFri3nd: im here\n\n\nI felt my heart stop beating for a split second as beads of sweat poured down my forehead and onto my cheeks. I felt so much terror in that moment and I was internally begging for one of my parents to come in and handle the situation. Suddenly, the lights flickered. I looked around the room and studied each lamp I had as they flickered faster and faster. I stood up straight and took a small step back as the tension built up in the room. \nI was then jumpscared by another notification. I didn't want to turn back and look, but something was urging me, pulling me to look. I gave into the urge and turned to look, and felt a deeper sense of dread. \n\n\nHelloFri3nd: you are unsafe\n\n\nAs soon as I saw that text, I swear that I literally heard nothing. Every ambient sound in the night outside my home just suddenly stopped. No frog sounds, no cicadas, not even my dog barked, and he usually always barks atleast once or twice every night. It was like one of those situations where a huge predator is lurking, and everything goes silent in fear. I began to slightly tear up as the tension and fear was becoming too much for me.\n \nThe lights began to flicker faster and faster, and I could feel myself losing my grip on reality. I then grabbed my computer desk and held on tight to support myself. Suddenly, the computer started bugging out. A bunch of malicious ads popped up everywhere, and then some messages saying eerie stuff like \"I see you\" or \"I'm in your head now\". A sudden sharp loud sound rung in my ears as I winced in pain and gripped the desk tighter. I held on so tight, feeling as if I would collapse as soon as I let go. The computer screen then started displaying a bunch of disturbing images that were ripped straight out of the internet. They looked like a mix of scary google images, crime scene images, and images from various old creepypastas. \n\nI slightly jumped back as the frightening images spooked me. I tried to look away, but i couldn't. Something was forcing me to stare into these nightmarish photos. The images kept popping up on the screen and overlapping eachother as they filled it up. My head hurt so bad and the muscles in my hands felt so tight. Suddenly, the screen started displaying different images. It looked like it was ripping images from the web and building a face, kinda like a scrapbook. The eyes were seemingly ripped from 2 women, one eye was brown and the other was green. \n\nThe face was an image of a ball of skin. The mouth was an image of what seemed to be dentures but with sharp, deadly teeth. It had no body, just its head and 2 completely different hands. I shuddered when I saw it and felt a sharp pain in my head. Whatever was in my computer was building a face for itself. \nI finally let go of the desk and fell back onto my bed, catching myself on the mattress. I then noticed something around my room. It looked like shadows growing and covering my walls. I quickly got up in fear and ran to my door, and opened it. I was about to run out the door when I saw something hunched over in the darkness of the hallway. \n\nI couldn't tell what it was at first, all I could see was a shadowy silhouette and a slight glare on its scleras. I backed up and it followed me, making itself visible in the flickering light of my room. It looked exactly like my mom, but it wasn't. It had large bulging eyes, and an inhumanely wide grin with bulging pronounced cheekbones. Its arms were covered with this black fluid and it's hands were clawed. I panicked and froze in terror as it inched closer to me. I felt like every muscle in my body suddenly locked up. I couldn't do anything but silently cry as I felt its cold presence begin to touch my skin. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst. Suddenly, I could hear my brothers voice echo in my mind. My eyes shot open and I saw my brother behind the creature. He looked concerned and confused, and he asked me if I was ok. I shook as I stared at him and contemplated on what to say.\n\nI couldn't tell him what was happening, because he would think I'm insane. I then looked at the creature, who was now right in my face, and I jumped back, grabbing the door handle and slamming the door in its face. I then locked the door and tried to think of what to do next. My eyes then wondered over to the plug that kept the computer on. I realized then what I had to do, and I quickly darted over to the plug and grabbed it. Suddenly, I got a new notification. I wasn't going to look at it, but again, it felt like something pulled me to look at it, and so I did. It was HelloFri3nd again.\n\n\nHelloFri3nd: DO NOT PULL THAT PLUG!!!\n\n\nI scowled and yanked the plug as hard as I could, shutting the computer off. As soon as I did that, everything went back to normal. The lights quit flickering, the shadows disappeared, and the night ambience was back. I finally felt normal again, no head pain or any discomfort. I then backed up and sat against my bed and had probably the hardest cry of my life. My parents checked on me soon after and I simply decided to just tell them that a hacker threatened us. We temporarily left the house for about a month or two and had the police check things out.  \n\nSince then\nI got rid of the computer and didn't get another one until 2010. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure that my friend was never really my friend... Or a human. I haven't had anymore experiences with HelloFri3nd, but i know he's still out there. So please, if you ever see a user with the name \"HelloFri3nd\", never friend them. Don't ever give them a way of communication with you. It seems that they can't affect you if you cut off all sources of communication with them and have a strong mental capacity. Thank you for listening to my story and stay safe.\n\n"},"600":{"title":"Disturbing Tiktok Account.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fate82\/disturbing_tiktok_account\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"CressGood9746","selftext":"Scrolling a few days ago i came across a very odd tiktok account.

That was one of those words his great-great-grandchildren would have told him was a \"cancelable offense\" but Charles didn't care. Much like The Great Gizmo, Charles was from a different age.\n\n\n\nCharles had first met Gizmo in Nineteen Nineteen when the world was still new and things made sense.\n\n\n\nIt had been at an expo in Connie Island, and his father had been rabid to see it.\n\n\n\n\"They say it's from Europe, and it has been touring since the eighteen hundred.

Most of the train guys knew the typical games, cards, dice, checkers, chess, but Charle's Dad had loved the game best of all. He was no grand master, barely above a novice, but he had taught Charles everything he knew about it from a very young age, and Charles had absorbed it like a sponge. He was one of the best in the burrows, maybe one of the best in the city, and he had taken third in the Central Park Chess Finals last year. \"And that was against guys three times your age, kid.\" his Dad had crowed.\n\n\n\nNow, he wanted his son to take on The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\nThe exhibition was taking place in a big tent not far from the show hall, and it was standing room only. Lots of people wanted to see this machine that could beat a man at chess, and they all wanted a turn to try it out. Most of them wouldn't, Charles knew, but they wanted the chance to watch it beat better men than them so they could feel superior for a little while.\n\n\n\nCharles didn't intend to give them the satisfaction.\n\n\n\nThe man who'd introduced the thing had been dressed in a crisp red and white striped suit, his flat-topped hat making him look like a carnival barker. He had thumped his cane and called the crowd to order, his eyes roving the assembled men and woman as if just searching for the right victim.\n\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentleman, what I have here is the most amazing technical marvel of the last century. He has bested Kings, Geniuses, and Politicians in the art of Chess and is looking for his next challenge. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, The Great GIZMO!\"\n\n\n\nCharles hadn't been terribly impressed when the man tore back the tarp and revealed the thing. It looked like a fortune teller, dressed in a long robe with a turban on its head boasting a tall feather and a large gem with many facets. It had a beard, a long mustachio that drooped with rings and bells, and a pair of far too expressive marble eyes. It moved jerkily, like something made of wires, and the people oooed and awwed over it, impressed.\n\n\n\n\"Now then, who will be the first to test its staggering strategy? Only five dollars for the chance to best The Great Gizmo.\"\n\n\n\nCharle's father had started to step forward, but Charles put a hand on his arm.\n\n\n\n\"Let's watch for a moment, Dad. I want to see how he plays.\"\n\n\n\n\"You sure?\" his Dad had asked, \"I figured you'd stump it first and then we'd walk off with the glory.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Charles said, standing back to watch as the first fellow approached, paying his money and taking a seat.\n\n\n\nThis was how Charles liked to play. First came the observation period, where he watched and made plans. He liked to stand back, blending in with the crowd so he could take the measure of his opponent. People rarely realized that you were studying their moves, planning counter moves, and when you stepped up and trounced them, they never saw it coming. That was always his favorite part, watching their time-tested strategies fall apart as they played on and destroyed themselves by second-guessing their abilities.\n\n\n\nThat hadn't happened that day in the tent at Connie Island.\n\n\n\nAs much as he watched and as much as he learned, Charles never quite understood the strategy at play with The Great Gizmo. He stuck to no gambit, he initiated no set strategy, and he was neither aggressive nor careful. He answered their moves with the best counter move available, every time, and he never failed to thwart them.\n\n\n\nAfter five others had been embarrassed, to the general amusement of the crowd, Charles decided it was his turn.\n\n\n\n\"A kid?\" the barker asked, \"Mr, I'll take your money, but I hate to steal from a man.\"\n\n\n\nHis Father had puffed up at that, \"Charlie is a chess protege. He'll whip your metal man.\"\n\n\n\nAnd so Charles took his seat, sitting eye to glass eye with the thing, and the game began.\n\n\n\nCharles would play a lot of chess in his long life, but he would never play a game quite that one-sided again.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo thwarted him at every move, countered his counters, ran circles around him, and by the end Charles wasn't sure he had put up any sort of fight at all. He had a middling collection of pieces, barely anything, and Gizmo had everything.\n\n\n\n\"Check Mate,\" the thing rasped, its voice full of secret humor, and Charles had nodded before walking away in defeat.\n\n\n\n\"No sweat, Charlie boy.\" His father had assured him, \"Damn creepy things a cheat anyway. That's what it is, just a cheating bit of nothing.\"\n\n\n\nCharles hadn't said anything, but he had made a vow to beat that pile of wires next time the chance arose.\n\n\n\nCharles saw The Great Gizmo sitting in the back of the arcade, forgotten and unused. He didn't know how much the owner had paid for it, but he doubted it was making it back. The Great Gizmo was a relic. No one came to the arcade to play chess anymore. There was a little placard in front of him telling his history and a sign that asked patrons not to damage the object. The camera over him probably helped with that, but it was likely more than that.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo looked like something that shouldn't exist, something that flew in the face of this \"uncanny valley\" that his great-grandson talked about sometimes, and people found it offputting.\n\n\n\nCharles, however, was used to it.\n\n\n\n\"Do you remember me?\" he asked, putting in a quarter as the thing shuddered and seemed to look up at him.\n\n\n\nIts robes were faded, its feather ragged, but its eyes were still intelligent.\n\n\n\n\"Charles,\" it croaked, just as it had on that long ago day.\n\n\n\nCharles had been in his second year of high school when he met The Great Gizmo for the second time. School was more a formality than anything, he could pass any test a college entrance board could throw at him, but they wouldn't give him the chance until he had a diploma. He was sixteen, a true protege now, and his chess skills had only increased over the years. He had taken Ruby Fawn to the fair that year and that was where he saw the sign proclaiming The Great Gizmo would be in attendance. He had drug her over to the tent, the girl saying she didn't want to see that creepy old thing, but he wanted a second chance at it.\n\n\n\nHis father was still working in the grease pits of the train yard, but he knew his face would light up when he heard how his son had bested his old chess rival.\n\n\n\nThe stakes had increased in seven years, it seemed. It was now eight dollars to play the champ, but the winner got a fifty-dollar cash prize. Fifty dollars was a lot of money in nineteen twenty-six, but Charles wanted the satisfaction of besting this thing more than anything. Despite what his father wanted, he had been running numbers for John McLure and his gang for over a year, and some well-placed bets had left him flush with cash.\n\n\n\n“Good luck, young man,” said the Barker, and Charles was surprised to find that it was the same barker as before. Time had not been kind to him. His suit was now faded, his hat fraid around the rim, and he had put on weight which bulged around the middle and made the suit roll, spoiling the uniform direction of the stripes. Despite that, it was still him, and he grinned at Charles as he took the familiar seat.\n\n\n\nThis time, the match was a little different. Charles had increased in skill, and he saw through many of the traps Gizmo set for him. The audience whispered quietly behind him, believing that The Great Gizmo had met his match, but the real show was just beginning. Charles had taken several key pieces, and as he took a second rook, the thing's eyes sparkled and it bent down as if to whisper something to him. The crowd would not have heard it, its voice was too low, but The Great Gizmo whispered a secret to Charles that would stick with him forever.\n\n\n\n“Charles, this will not be our last game, we will play eight more times before the end.”\n\n\n\nIt was given in a tone of absolute certainty, not an offhand statement made to get more of Charles hard-earned money. Charles looked mystified, not sure if he had actually heard what the thing had said, and it caused him to flub his next move and lose a piece he had not wanted to.\n\n\n\nCharles persevered, however, pressing on and taking more pieces, and just as he believed victory was within his grasp, the thing spoke again.\n\n\n\n“Charles, you will live far longer than you may wish to.”\n\n\n\nAgain, it was spoken in that tone of absolute assuredness, and it caused Charles to miss what should’ve been obvious.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo won after two more moves and Charles was, again, defeated.\n\n\n\n“Better luck next time,” said the Barker, and even as Charles's date told him he had done really well, but Charles knew he would never be great until he beat this machine.\n\n\n\nThe pieces appeared, Charles set his up, and they began what would be their fourth game. Charles, strategically meeting the machine's offensive plays with his own practice gambits, would gladly admit that the three games he had played against The Great Gizmo had improved his chess game more than any other match he had ever played. Charles had faced old timers in the park, grandmasters at chess tournaments, and everything in between. Despite it all, The Great Gizmo never ceased to amaze and test his skill.\n\n\n\nCharles tried not to think about their last match.\n\n\n\nIt was a match where Charles had done the one thing he promised he would never do.\n\n\n\nHe had cheated.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo had become something of a mania in him after he had lost to it a second time. He had gone to college, married his sweetheart, and begun a job that paid well and was not terribly difficult. With his business acumen, Charles had been placed as the manager of a textile mill. Soon he had bought it and was running the mill himself. Charles had turned the profits completely around after he had purchased the mill, seeing what the owners were doing wrong and fixing it when the mill belonged to him. He’d come a long way from the little kid who sat in the tent at Coney Island, but that tent was never far from his mind.\n\n\n\nCharles had one obsession, and it was chess.\n\n\n\nEven his father had told him that he took the game far too seriously. He and his father still played at least twice a week, and it was mostly a chance for the two to talk. His father was not able to work the train yard anymore, he’d lost a leg to one of the locomotives when it had fallen out of the hoist on him, but that hardly mattered. His father lived at the home that Charles shared with his wife, a huge house on the main street of town, and his days were spent at leisure now.\n\n\n\n“You are the best chess player I have ever seen, Charlie, but you take it too seriously. It’s just a game, an entertainment, but you treat every chess match like it’s war.”\n\n\n\nCharles would laugh when he said these things, but his father was right.\n\n\n\nEvery chess match was war, and the General behind all those lesser generals was The Great Gizmo. He had seen the old golem in various fairs and sideshows, but he had resisted the urge to go and play again. He couldn’t beat him, not yet, and when he did play him, he wanted to be ready. He had studied chess the way some people study law or religion. He knew everything, at least everything that he could learn from books and experience, but it appeared he had one more teacher to take instruction from.\n\n\n\nCharles liked to go to the park and play against the old-timers that stayed there. Some of them had been playing chess longer and he had been alive, and they had found ways to bend or even break the established rules of strategy. On the day in question, he was playing against a young black man, he called himself Kenny, and when he had taken Charleses rook, something strange happened. The rook was gone, but so had his knight and had been beside it. Charles knew the knight had been there, but when he looked across the board, he saw that it was sitting beside the rook on Kenny's side. He had still won the match, Charles was at a point where he could win with nearly any four pieces on the board, but when they played again, he reached out and caught Kenny by the wrist as he went to take his castle off the board.\n\n\n\nIn his hand was a pawn as well, and Kenny grinned like it was all a big joke.\n\n\n\nCharles wasn’t mad, though, on the contrary. The move had been so quick and so smooth that he hadn’t even seen it the first time. He wondered if it would work for a creature that did not possess sight? It might be just the edge he was looking for.\n\n\n\n“Hey, man, we ain’t playing for money or nothing. There’s no need to get upset over it.”\n\n\n\n“Show me,” Charles asked, and Kenny was more than happy to oblige.\n\n\n\nKenny showed him the move, telling him that the piece palmed always had to be on the right of the piece you would take it.\n\n\n\n“If it’s on the left, they focus on that piece. If it’s on the right though, then the piece is practically hidden by the one you just put down. You can’t hesitate, it has to be a smooth move, but if you’re quick enough, and you’re sure enough, it’s damn near undetected.”\n\n\n\nCharles practiced the move for hours, even using it against his own father, something he felt guilty about. He could do it without hesitation, without being noticed, and he was proud of his progress, despite the trickery. He was practicing it for about two years before he got his chance like The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\nBy then, Charles was a master of not just chess but of that little sleight of hand. He hadn't dared use it at any chess tournaments, the refs were just too vigilant, as were the players, but in casual games, as well as at the park, he had become undetectable by any but the most observant. He was good enough to do it without hesitation, and when he opened his paper and saw a squib that The Great Gizmo would be at Coney Island that weekend, right before going overseas for a ten-year tour, he knew this would be his chance.\n\n\n\nThere was no fee to play against the thing this time. The Barker was still there, but he looked a little less jolly these days. He was an old, fat man who had grown sour and less jovial. He looked interested in being gone from here, in getting to where he would be paid more for the show. He told Charles to take a spot in line, and as the players took their turn, many of them people \n\nCharles had bested already, they were quickly turned away with a defeat at the hand of the golem.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo looked downright dapper as he sat down, seeing that the man had gotten him a new robe and feather for his journey. The eyes still sparkled knowingly, however, and Charles settled himself so as not to be thrown by any declarations of future knowledge this time. The pieces came out, and the game began.\n\n\n\nCharles did well, at first. He was cutting a path through The Great Gizmo's defenses, and the thing again told him they would play eight more times before the end. That was constant, it seemed, but after that, the match turned ugly. The Great Gizmo recaptured some of his pieces and set them to burning. Charles was hurting, but still doing well. He took a few more, received his next expected bit of prophecy, and then the play became barbaric. The Great Gizmo was playing very aggressively, and Charles had to maneuver himself to stay one step ahead of the thing. He became desperate, trying to get the old golem into position, and when he saw the move, he took it.\n\n\n\nHe had palmed a knight and a pawn when something unexpected happened.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo grabbed his hand, just as he had grabbed Kenny's, and it leaned down until its eyes were inches from his.\n\n\n\nIt breathed out, its breath full of terrible smoke and awful prophecy, and Charles began to choke. The smoke filled his mouth, taking his breath, and he blacked out as he fell sideways. The thing let him go as he fell, but his last image of The Great Gizmo was of his too-expressive eyes watching him with disappointment.\n\n\n\nHe had been found wanting again, and Charles wondered before passing out if there would be a fourth time.   \n\n\n\nCharles woke up three days later in the hospital, his wife rejoicing that God had brought him back to them.\n\n\n\nBy then, The Great Gizmo was on a boat to England, out of his reach.\n\n\n\nThe year after that, World War two would erupt and Charles had feared he would never get another match with the creature.\n\n\n\nThe match had begun as it always did. Charles put aside The Great Gizmo's gambits one at a time. He played brilliantly, thwarting the Golem's best offenses, and then it came time to attack. He cut The Great Gizmo to shred, his line all a tatter, and when he told him they would play eight games before the end, Charles knew he was advancing well. He had lost barely any pieces of his own, and as the thing began to set its later plans in order, he almost laughed. This was proving to be too easy.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo and the Barker had been in Poland when it fell to the Blitzkrieg, and the Great Gizmo had dropped off the face of the earth for a while. Charles had actually enlisted after Pearl Harbor, but not for any sense of patriotism. He had a mania growing in him, and it had been growing over the years. He knew where the thing had last been, and he meant he would find the Barker and his mysterious machine. The Army was glad to have him, and his time in college made it easy to become an officer after basic training. They offered him a desk job, something in shipping, but he turned them down.\n\n\n\nIf he wanted to find The Great Gizmo, then he would have to go to war.\n\n\n\nHe had fought at Normandy, in Paris, in a hundred other skirmishes, and that was where he discovered something astounding.\n\n\n\nDespite the danger Charles put himself in, he didn't die. Charles was never more than slightly wounded, a scratch or a bruise, but sustained no lasting damage. He wondered how this could be, but then he remembered the words of The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\n“You will live far longer than you may wish to.”\n\n\n\nHe returned home after the war, but the old construct returned to America. It took a while for his contacts to get back on their feet, but eventually what he got were rumors and hearsay. He heard that Hitler had taken the thing, adding it to his collection of objects he believed to be supernatural. He heard it had been destroyed in a bombing run over Paris. He heard one of McArthur's Generals had taken it as a spoil of war, and many other unbelievable things.\n\n\n\nAfter the war, it was supposed to have been taken to Jordan, and then to Egypt, then to Russia, then to South Africa, and, finally, back to Europe, but he never could substantiate these things.\n\nAnd all the while, Charles grew older, less sturdy, but never died.\n\n\n\nHe was over one hundred years old, one hundred and six to be precise, but he could pass for a robust fifty most of the time. He had buried his wife, all three of his children, and two of his grandchildren. He had lost his youngest son to Vietnam and his oldest grandson to the Iraq war, and he was trying to keep his great-grandson from enlisting now. They all seemed to want to follow in his footsteps, but they couldn't grasp that he had done none of this for his country.\n\n\n\n\"Checkmate,\" he spat viciously as he conquered his oldest rival.\n\n\n\nHe had gone to war not for his wife, or the baby in her arms, or even the one holding her hand.\n\n\n\nHe had gone to war for this metal monstrosity and the evil prophecy it held.\n\n\n\n\"Well played,\" it intoned, and he hated the sense of pride that filled him at those words, \"You may now ask me one question, any question, and I will answer it for you. You have defeated The Great Gizmo, and now the secrets of the universe are open to you.\"\n\n\n\nSome men would have taken this chance to learn the nature of time, the identity of God, maybe even that night's lotto numbers, but there was only one question that interested Charles.\n\n\n\n\"How much longer will I live?\"\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo sat back a little, seeming to contemplate the question.\n\n\n\n\"You will live for as long as there is a Great Gizmo. Our lives are connected by fate, and we shall exist together until we do not.\"\n\n\n\nCharles thought about that for a long time, though he supposed he had known all along what the answer would be.\n\n\n\nThe man behind the counter looked startled when the old guy approached him and asked to buy The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\n\"That old thing?\" He asked, not quite believing it, \"It's an antique, buddy. I picked it up in Maine hoping it would draw in some extra customers, but it never did. Thing creeps people out, it creeps me out too, if I'm being honest. I'll sell it to ya for fifteen hundred, that's what I paid for it and I'd like to get at least my money back on the damn thing.\"\n\n\n\nCharles brought out a money clip and peeled twenty hundred dollar bills. He handed them to the man, saying he would have men here to collect it in an hour.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, pal, you paid me too much. I only wanted,\"\n\n\n\n\"The rest is a bonus for finding something I have searched for my whole life.\"\n\n\n\nHe called the men he had hired to move the things and stayed there until they had it secured on the truck.\n\n\n\nCharles had a spot for it at the house, a room of other treasures he had found while looking for the old golem. The walls were fire resistant, the floor was concrete, and the ceiling was perfectly set to never fall or shift. Charles had been keeping a spot for The Great Gizmo for years, and now he would keep him, and himself, for as long as forever would last.\n\n\n\nOr at least, he reflected, for four more chess matches.\n\n\n\nWasn't that what The Great Gizmo had promised him, after all?   \n\nThe Great Gizmo"},"602":{"title":"Looking for a Creepypasta, does anyone remember the name?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1faxfin\/looking_for_a_creepypasta_does_anyone_remember\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Kspacel","selftext":"I'm looking for a story about a boy who recounts small events that happened in his life, like his cat disappearing or waking up in the middle of the forest not knowing where he is.

Growing up, I never really thought much about it—my adoptive parents, Diane and Mark, always treated me like I was their own. I had a normal life, a happy one, for the most part. But around the time I turned sixteen, I started to wonder. Who were my real parents? Where did I come from? Why did they give me up?\n\nIt wasn’t something I talked about with Diane or Mark. I knew it would hurt them. They had always been so protective of me, so careful to make sure I never felt like I was missing anything. But a part of me needed to know. So, when I was sixteen, I started looking. Quietly. Online, forums, Facebook groups for adopted kids trying to find their birth parents.\n\nI didn’t expect anything to come of it. But then, about six months ago, something happened.\n\nI found them.\n\nWell, they found me. It was a message on Facebook, an account with no picture and a name I didn’t recognize: “J.M.ParentFinder.” The message was short, just a few lines.\n\n“We’ve been looking for you for so long. We didn’t have a choice. Please, let us explain. We want to meet.”\n\nI was suspicious. But they knew things—things that no one could’ve known unless they were my real parents. My original birth name, the name of the adoption agency, the small details of where I was born. All the stuff my adoptive parents had been careful to keep private. So I believed them.\n\nWe started talking. Little by little, they told me about themselves. They had been young when they had me, too young to take care of a baby. They had tried, but it was too much. So they made the hardest decision of their lives and gave me up for adoption. They never stopped looking for me, though. They said they always wondered where I was, if I was happy, if I’d hate them if we ever met.\n\nI didn’t tell Diane and Mark. I knew it would hurt them. I knew they’d feel betrayed. This was something I had to do on my own. I wanted to meet my real parents—just once, to see if it would fill the gap that had been growing inside me for years.\n\nWe planned to meet on the night before my 18th birthday. I’d be legally an adult, and I wouldn’t need permission to go anywhere. Still, I didn’t want Diane and Mark to know, so I decided to sneak out. My parents—the ones I was about to meet—agreed. They said it would be too hard for me to explain everything right now, that it was better to keep it between us until we had a proper reunion.\n\nSo, I packed a small bag and snuck out of the house that night. My heart was racing, but it was more from excitement than fear. I was finally going to meet them.\n\nWe were meeting at a gas station just outside of town, a place I knew but never really paid much attention to. They said they would pick me up there and take me to their home for the weekend.\n\nWhen I got there, it was dark and mostly empty. A few cars were parked near the pumps, and off to the side, I saw an old, beat-up minivan. The headlights flashed twice when I approached.\n\nThat was them.\n\nI took a deep breath and walked over. As I got closer, I could see them—a man and a woman sitting in the front seats, smiling at me. The woman waved, and I smiled back. This was it. My real parents.\n\nI climbed into the backseat. The van smelled faintly of old leather and fast food, but I didn’t care. I was here. I was finally with them.\n\n“Hi, sweetheart,” the woman said, turning to face me. “You have no idea how long we’ve been waiting for this.”\n\nHer voice was warm, and she reached out to squeeze my hand. The man didn’t say anything, just smiled and started the van. We pulled out of the gas station, heading down a road I didn’t recognize.\n\nThey asked me about my life—how school was, if I had any close friends, if Diane and Mark were treating me well. It all felt normal. A little stilted, maybe, but I figured they were just nervous, too. It’s not every day you meet your kid after almost two decades.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the road turned darker, and I started noticing we were heading away from town. The trees became denser, the houses sparser. It was subtle, but something in the air changed. My stomach knotted, but I told myself it was just nerves.\n\n“We’re almost there,” the woman—Julia, she said her name was—said with a smile.\n\nI nodded, watching the dark road ahead.\n\nBut then she asked, “So, how much money did they leave you with?”\n\nI blinked, caught off guard. “What?”\n\n“For school,” she clarified. “How much did your parents leave you? You know, college funds, savings.”\n\nThat’s when something clicked. The casualness of the question, the focus shifting to something material. I shrugged it off, laughing nervously, thinking maybe it was just an awkward attempt at small talk.\n\nA few minutes later, Julia asked, “Have you ever left the house alone like this before?”\n\nI froze. “Uh, no, not really. Just with friends sometimes.”\n\n“Good,” she said softly, as if reassuring herself. “That’s good.”\n\nThe atmosphere in the van changed. My palms started sweating. Something wasn’t right. Why did that question make me feel so…wrong?\n\nThe road became bumpier, and we passed a “No Trespassing” sign, turning onto a dirt path. It was dark now, darker than it should’ve been. The trees closed in around us, their branches clawing at the van.\n\n“How much farther is it?” I asked, my voice shaking a little.\n\n“We’re almost there,” the man—Matt—said, speaking for the first time. His voice was low, too low.\n\nI glanced at the door handle. “Can I use my phone? Just to let them know I’m safe?”\n\nJulia’s smile widened—too wide. “No need for that, sweetheart.

Everything had been a lie.\n\nI reached for the door handle, panic setting in, but it was locked. The van slowed, coming to a stop in the middle of the woods.\n\nMatt turned in his seat, his eyes gleaming in the dark. “It’s time for you to meet your real family.”"},"606":{"title":"Help Finding an Old Creepy Story About a Secret Wikipedia Place","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fanhco\/help_finding_an_old_creepy_story_about_a_secret\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Intelligent_Check772","selftext":"Hello everyone\n\n\nI’m trying to track down a story i saw on tiktok(highly confident it came from reddit) a while back and it may have originated in this subreddit or at the very least you guys can help\n\n\nHeres all i can remember\n\n\nThe story begins with someone talking about a hidden place within wikipedia\n\n\n\nThe narrator describes seeing colors beyond anything he had ever seen before \n\n\nBy the end of the story, two humanoid figure come to the narrators door to retrieve the laptop he used to access the hidden place"},"607":{"title":"Corpsewood Manor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fai3v8\/corpsewood_manor\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"No-Glass-3279","selftext":"We should’ve never gone down that old, unmarked country road. I knew it, deep down, as soon as Tyler’s old Chevy skidded off the asphalt onto the gravel, the headlights slicing through the dense blackness of the Chattahoochee National Forest. The road was more of a narrow, forgotten trail—just a strip of dirt barely wide enough for the truck. Trees loomed in on both sides, their branches like twisted claws scratching at the truck's paint. Jenna clutched my arm from her spot in between Tyler and me on the bench seat, her face a tight mask of unease.\n\n“It’ll be fun,” Tyler said, his voice too loud in the oppressive silence, trying to shake off the nervous tension in the cab. “Just some harmless exploring.”\n\nI could hear Melissa and Craig's typical sibling banter in the back. They were ready to turn this creepy night into some stupid Instagram adventure. But me? I just felt uneasy-nerves, maybe. But the lizard part of my brain was screaming at me to get the hell out of there.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Tyler killed the engine. The silence was instant and absolute, save for the gentle rustle of leaves in the cold night breeze. Dead Horse Road had led us to a small clearing, and beyond that, the barely-there trail winding deeper into the forest. Somewhere out there, three miles or so, lay Corpsewood Manor.\n\nWe got out, flashlights flicking on, beams cutting through the fog that clung low to the ground. The night seemed thicker here, the dark more oppressive. Tyler led the way, like he always did. Craig and Melissa followed, stumbling over roots and rocks, laughing a little too loudly. Jenna squeezed my hand, her grip tight, as if she could feel it too—the way the air seemed to hum with something our brains couldn’t, or wouldn’t, identify.\n\nTyler's voice cut through the heavy silence, almost eager to break the tension. “Alright, so, Corpsewood Manor. You all know the basics, right? Back in the ‘70s, this place was built by Dr. Charles Scudder and his partner, Joseph Odom. Scudder was a professor of pharmacology in Chicago, but he left all that behind to move out here, away from society.” \n\nJenna glanced up at me, already looking uneasy. I could feel her pulse quickening against my arm, but Tyler wasn’t about to let up. \n\n“Thing is, Scudder wasn’t just some eccentric professor,” Tyler continued. “He had a serious interest in the occult—rumored to be into Satanism, too. Built this place as a kind of retreat, or maybe a shrine. They say the manor was filled with books on alchemy, ritual magic, and all kinds of weird stuff. The dude even painted his own murals—demons, pentagrams, that sort of thing. And they weren't just for show. He believed in this stuff, big time.” \n\nJenna shivered beside me, her grip tightening. “I heard they used to have parties out here,” she said softly, more to herself than anyone. “Weird parties.” \n\nTyler nodded, leaning into the story. “Yeah, exactly. Scudder and Odom didn’t exactly keep to themselves. They’d invite people over—friends, drifters, anyone really. They called it their ‘Pink Room.’ No electricity, no running water, just candlelight and booze. Scudder made his own homemade LSD, so people would get high, talk philosophy, or… whatever else they did. There were rumors of rituals, some weird sex stuff, and sacrifices—animal sacrifices mostly, but who knows, right?” \n\nCraig snorted. “So, like, typical hippie cult stuff?” \n\nTyler’s expression darkened. “Maybe. But it went deeper than that. Scudder called himself a follower of ‘Thelema,’ which was this occult philosophy started by Aleister Crowley, you know, the ‘Great Beast.’ Scudder also kept a small altar in the manor, with a skull, candles, and that statue of Mephistopheles—the same statue that went missing after the murders.” \n\nFinally, after what felt like hours of trudging through the endless dark, the trees began to thin, and we saw it; a crumbling silhouette against the moonlit sky: Corpsewood Manor. Or what was left of it. The ruins stood like skeletal fingers clawing up from the earth, half-swallowed by ivy and tangled in moss, their jagged edges sharp against the night. Broken brick walls leaned precariously, and shards of shattered glass glinted in our flashlight beams—a once-stately place, now left to rot and ruin.\n\nJenna stopped, her breath catching in her throat. “This… this is it?” Her voice was a strained whisper, as if speaking too loudly might awaken something lurking in the dark.\n\n“Yeah,” Tyler replied, his voice low and almost reverent. “This is it.”\n\nWe crept forward, our steps slow and tentative. Every movement felt heavy, deliberate, like the earth itself resisted our intrusion. The air seemed thicker here, colder, each breath a shiver. The shadows felt alive, pressing in from all sides. We stepped over what remained of a crumbling threshold, crossing into the gutted remains of the manor. Inside, the ground was littered with broken bottles, remnants of past visitors who’d come seeking a thrill and left behind their trash. A rusted can crunched under my foot, and I flinched at the sound, too loud in the stillness. \n\n“Look at this,” Melissa whispered, pointing to a broken wine bottle with a faded, torn label. “People really came out here to party?” \n\nTyler’s flashlight swept across the ground, revealing more—old cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, a discarded lighter. \"Yeah,\" he muttered, “particularly fucked up, considering Joseph Odom’s ashes were spread here.” His light paused over a dark stain on the brick floor—something that might have been oil, or… something else. \n\nMelissa stopped in her tracks and spun on her heel, her face pale and strained in the dim light. “What the hell, Tyler? You didn’t think to mention that before we came out here? That his ashes were spread here?” Her voice rose, frantic and edged with anger. “Are you kidding me? This isn’t some haunted house attraction! This is a real place where people died—where their bodies were literally scattered!” \n\n“Melissa, calm down,” Tyler said, his tone steady. “Plenty of people have come here and left without anything happening. It’s just a story, just a place. We’ll be fine. Look around—people partied here, trashed the place, and went home with no problem. Nothing’s gonna happen to us.” \n\nMelissa’s eyes narrowed to slits, her rage barely contained as she practically strangled Tyler with her gaze. The tension between them crackled in the cold air. Tyler, unfazed, continued his unsettling lecture about Corpsewood Manor. \n\n“Back in the early '80s, people around here started getting nervous,” Tyler began, his voice dropping to a whisper as he continued. “Rumors spread that Scudder, the owner, was a Satanist. And in December 1982, things went straight to hell. Two guys, Tony West and Avery Brock, who’d been out to the manor a few times, decided to rob the place. They were drunk, high, whatever. Things went south fast. They shot both Scudder and Odom, killed their dogs, Beelzebub and Arsinath… all while Scudder’s collection of human skulls stared them in the face.” \n\nA moment of silence followed, broken only by the distant rustle of leaves. Jenna turned to Tyler with a puzzled frown. “Wait… you said Avery Brock? You have the same last name as one of the murderers? That’s creepy…” \n\nTyler’s lips curled into a smirk. “Even better—he’s my uncle.” \n\nJenna’s eyes widened, and a chill ran down my spine. “That’s… pretty fucked up, man,” I said, trying to hide my unease. Jenna nodded, her face pale. “Yeah, why would you be proud of something so horrible?” \n\nMelissa’s eyes flashed with anger. “You goddamned ASSHOLE! You brought us to the place where YOUR UNCLE MURDERED PEOPLE!” Her voice rose sharply, cutting through the night. “This isn’t some casual adventure! It’s so fucked up that you’d drag us here knowing the history!” \n\nTyler’s face hardened, his eyes narrowing. “It’s just history. Not my fault what my uncle did.” \n\nMelissa’s face twisted. “You’ve been boasting about your own shitty family history like it’s something to be proud of. That’s messed up, you’re fucking sick.” \n\nTyler’s expression darkened, his tone growing colder. “Yeah? Well, at least I’m not known around here for being a raging slut-” \n\nBefore he could finish, Craig stepped forward, his face set in a protective glare. “I will fucking end you, boy. Back up off my sister-” Tyler’s hostility flared, and the argument grew more heated. Sensing the danger, I stepped in quickly, trying to diffuse the situation. \n\n“Look, this isn’t helping anyone. Let’s just leave before things get any worse. This is seriously messed up. You should have told us about this before dragging us into a fucked-up field trip.” \n\nTyler’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing. The silence that followed was thick with unspoken fears and the weight of the night’s revelations, as we gathered ourselves and prepared to leave. \n\nThe wind shifted, growing colder and whispering through the brick ruins like a sinister hiss. Tyler’s face grew momentarily serious. “You ever hear of Faust?” he asked, but before Tyler could continue, Craig and I exchanged uneasy glances.\n\n“Tyler, just stop,” I said, trying to cut him off.\n\n“You’re really pushing it mother fu-” Craig started, his voice edged with increasing frustration before Melissa silenced him with a firm look.\n\nTyler ignored us, his tone growing more intense. “Scudder was obsessed with Faust. The legend says he sold his soul to the devil for knowledge. Who knows what kind of deals Scudder might have made out here in these woods?”\n\n“Tyler, seriously, stop talking,” I urged again, but his words persisted, carrying an unsettling weight through the dark forest.\n\nJenna moved closer to me, her fingers brushing mine. “Why does it feel like… like we’re being watched?”\n\nI didn’t have an answer. The whole place felt wrong like the ruins were breathing, watching, waiting. The silence was so complete it felt like a living, palpable thing pressing against my skin. I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of the atmosphere, the darkness more solid than air.\n\nWe continued to explore, pushing deeper into the ruins, our flashlight beams slicing through the murk. A broken, rotting wooden staircase loomed to our right, leading to a second floor that had long since collapsed. We found what remained of the Pink Room, now just a shell of its former self—bare walls still bearing faint, faded murals of demons and sigils. Tyler moved ahead, pushing through a tangle of ivy, when Jenna stopped suddenly.\n\n“Did you hear that?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI listened, straining against the silence. A faint noise, just on the edge of hearing. A low, rumbling growl, like distant thunder, but it came from the shadows… close, too close. Then another growl, answering from the opposite direction, deeper, more menacing. The sound vibrated through the floor, through my bones.\n\nJenna’s grip on my arm tightened painfully. “What was that?” Her voice trembled, panic creeping in.\n\nI swung my flashlight toward the sound. For a moment, I saw nothing but shadows. Then they emerged, slowly, from opposite sides of the clearing. Two shapes, massive and dark, moving through the gloom with a predatory grace. They were more shadow than flesh, their forms barely visible in the dim light. Their eyes, though—those were unmistakable. They glowed like hot coals, a dull, reddish light burning in the depths of the night. Beelzebub and Arsinath—Scudder’s dogs, the guardians of Corpsewood, still patrolling their territory even in death.\n\n“Run!” Tyler’s shout was almost drowned out by the sudden, explosive barking, a sound that seemed to shake the very ground beneath us.\n\nCraig panicked, turning to sprint, but he took two frantic steps before his foot slipped on a patch of moss. He tumbled backward down a small, steep embankment, disappearing into what had once been a pond—now a dry, rocky basin filled with detritus. His body landed with a sickening crunch, the sound of bone against stone echoing in the night. I heard his scream, sharp and shrill, reverberating through the ruins.\n\nThe dogs moved like shadows given form, silent and impossibly fast. One bounded down the slope with terrifying agility, landing with a heavy thud. Craig tried to scramble away, but his leg was twisted beneath him, his movements frantic, desperate. His hands clawed at the earth, fingers scraping against something cold and hard—the broken remains of a pink stone gargoyle, half-buried in the mud. He was pinned, helpless.\n\nThe mastiffs pounced, their massive jaws closing around him. Craig’s screams filled the night, a sound that turned my blood to ice. I felt Jenna’s fingers digging into my arm, her breath quick and shallow, on the verge of hyperventilation.\n\nI grabbed her, pulling her away, toward the remnants of what must have been a parlor, when I saw him.\n\nCharles Scudder. Or the thing that had once been him.\n\nHe stepped out of the shadows, his face a ruin of flesh, eyes milky and unseeing yet somehow fixed on us with an unnatural rage. His clothes hung in tatters, filthy with dirt and mold. In his mummified hand, he clutched something—a tarnished, heavy statue, glinting dully in the moonlight. The missing statue of Mephistopheles.\n\nTyler stood frozen, his eyes locked onto the corpse of Scudder, a mixture of fear and acceptance flickering across his face. The dead figure raised the statue high, a grotesque reminder of Avery Brock’s sins. As Scudder’s dead eyes bore into him, Tyler sank slowly to his knees, his expression a haunting blend of resignation and dread. The statue, gripped with unnatural strength, hovered above him, casting a long shadow as if preparing to deliver the ultimate retribution for the sins of his uncle. The forest held its breath, the weight of inevitability pressing down on Tyler as he awaited his grim fate.\n\nThe crack echoed through the woods before I even saw it—Tyler’s skull splitting open under the crushing weight. Blood erupted, dark and glistening, spraying across the ruined walls and dripping in dark rivulets. But Scudder didn’t stop. His hands, wet with blood, rose and fell with mechanical precision, the statue smashing down again and again. Tyler's body twitched and jerked with each brutal impact, his flesh tearing, bones shattering under the relentless assault. The wet, sickening thuds filled the air, punctuated by the crunch of splintering bone and the soft, gurgling sounds from what remained of Tyler’s ruined head. The corpse kept beating as if driven by a fury that death couldn’t quell.\n\nMelissa’s scream cut through the night, a sharp, keening wail that sent a shiver down my spine. She turned to flee, but the forest had already closed in, the trail swallowed by an impenetrable darkness. We were trapped, the air thick with a palpable, sinister energy. The shadows around us began to stir, creeping closer with an unsettling purpose.\n\nSuddenly, the foliage sprang to life. Vines lashed out like serpents, wrapping around Melissa's ankles and yanking her off her feet. She clawed desperately at the ground, but the possessed plants were relentless, dragging her inch by inch toward the ruins of the old coop. Her screams grew frantic, then choked as the vines tightened around her throat, pulling her deeper into the darkness.\n\nMelissa’s cries grew faint, lost in the dense, suffocating dark, and with a terrible finality, I knew we had lost her. Jenna’s grip on my arm was like a vice, her face drained of color, her eyes wide with a terror that seemed to pierce through me. We turned and ran—ran until our throats were raw and the muscles in our legs screamed for relief, until we burst out of the forest and straight to the truck.\n\nWe escaped….Physically.\n\nJenna… Jenna didn’t quite make it out.\n\nWhat she saw in those last moments fractured her mind. She stopped sleeping, her eyes darting around like she could still see the shadows moving, creeping ever closer. She’d mutter to herself in the dark, nonsense words mixed with prayers, her fingers scratching at her arms until they bled. She wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t drink, just sat rocking back and forth, whispering about vines crawling up her legs, about Melissa’s face emerging from the shadows, about a voice that kept calling her name in a low, mournful wail.\n\nThe doctors tried everything, but nothing could reach her. She shrieked if anyone touched her, her hands clawing at empty air like she was fighting something only she could see. It wasn't long before they sent her to a mental health facility, her mind shattered, broken by that night at Corpsewood.\n\nAnd now, I sit here, my hands trembling, trying to make sense of it all—trying to put this nightmare into words. I don't know how much time I have left. Arsinath and Beelzebub have been circling the house for two days, their black forms pacing just beyond the windows. I can feel their gaze through the walls, feel their presence thickening the air.\n\nThey’re waiting for me.\n\n"},"608":{"title":"Ritual creepypasta with a time loop where the narrator turns out to be the snake in the garden of Eden","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1faemz7\/ritual_creepypasta_with_a_time_loop_where_the\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"the-book-anaconda","selftext":"Please help me find this creepypasta \n\nThe narrator starts out by explaining how to perform a quite complex ritual which I don't remember the details of but involves a masked man, a long passage of sorts, a question possibly asked by the masked man and a choice. \n\nThe narrator successfully completes the ritual and is transformed into a snake, after which she (I'm pretty sure it was a she) has an epiphany and understands how everything began and what and why she is supposed to do next (make them eat the apple) and explains the purpose of the time loop to us"},"609":{"title":"I am 45 years old and I wear a diaper to bed ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fb045j\/i_am_45_years_old_and_i_wear_a_diaper_to_bed\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I am 45 years old and I wear diapers to bed. I know this is embarrassing to say but I literally have to wear diapers to bed in case I wet myself, or do the other thing in bed.

I have a company called Roy and sons ltd, because I have two healthy sons who I hope for them to take over when I pass on from this life. \n\nLast year though as I went to bed, it was around midnight that I wet the bed. My first son that I had with my wife, he had gone missing. We tried everything to find him but in the end we had to accept that he was gone. He went out and never came back home and we assumed he was at his friends house, but he was nowhere to be found. I woke up to find my missing eldest son in my room covered in water and other questionable marks. I knew what I had to do. \n\nI changed the title of my business to Roy, sons and missing sons Ltd. I was so embarrassed to have wet the bed. Then a couple of days later I saw another son of mine appear in front of me in the middle of the night. I had an affair with a woman many years ago in another 3rd world country and she had my son. I bandaged them and when the son appeared in my room looking all starved and beaten up. I knew I had to change my business title to Roy, sons, missing sons and illegitimate sons Ltd. \n\nThen when i went to bed on another time, I saw my daughter. I had a daughter that was murdered by a boyfriend of hers. That murderous boyfriend of hers turned out to be another one of my sons that I had with another woman, but I wasn't ready to be a father. My daughters murderous boyfriend then unalived himself after the act. He did to get back at me for abandoning them. \n\nI knew then that i had to change the name of my company to Roy, sons, missing sons, illegitimate sons, murdered daughters and bastard sons Ltd. Then from then on, I saw all my children that I should have taken of appear to me in the middle of night, and it would make lose control of my bladders and intestines. So I wear a diaper now.

Any how as I am running  away, the two police officers chasing me start reporting me to other police officers through their walkie talkies. They start to describe my appearance and I was really shocked. They said that I looked to be in my 20s, tall and of strong muscular build. \n\nI couldn't believe it and i turned around and stopped running. They arrested me but I didn't get sent to jail, I had to do voluntary work and clean up areas.

Many years ago (probably in 2014 or 2015) I saw a video on a European Spanish YouTube channel that had a section where he narrated creepypastas and stories with dark plots, but I don't think any of them belonged to him, so I'm looking for help here to find this creepypasta or story that I saw at that time with the vague memory I have of the plot. What I remember from that possible creepypasta was the following: a man and a woman (probably college students) were in a loving relationship, but the girl's parents didn't like the boy, so they forced her to meet another boy and become the latter's fiancée, which devastated the first boy who was in a relationship with her for quite some time. Because of that, the first guy the girl was with called her with the intention of asking her to come and get some of her things and pictures that he no longer wanted to have with him. When the girl arrived, she seemed a little nervous, as if she wanted to leave quickly because she knew she could no longer be with the guy, but the guy killed her to rip off parts of her body with the excuse that \"those parts of her are his\" or something similar. The guy was convicted and in court he said that he only took what was his, including the girl's heart literally. (I think the girl told him that she was his in an affectionate way and that's where the idea that she belongs to him comes from)"},"622":{"title":"Grandpa's Old Chest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1fa3imc\/grandpas_old_chest\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"thewebdevcody","selftext":"[https:\/\/youtu.be\/gcqIb0flhfI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/gcqIb0flhfI)\n\nAny time I was visiting my grandparents, I'd often find a way to slip away into the basement to explore the interesting stuff they've collected over the years.  He had the typical things that old people might collect, such as clothing, boxes, old bikes, trinkets.  One thing that always caught my eye was my grandpas old chest. It was one of those antique ones that you'd probably imagine had a bunch of old world war two souvenirs in it or something.  It had a giant pad lock on the front of it, so I never got a chance to see what was inside.\n\nI always enjoyed getting to hangout with them, we'd often watch tv shows together or bake cookies together.  One time I was visiting with them, and we were all sitting down to eat dinner together.   I remember asking my grandpa about the chest in the basement, but he just make a joke saying it just had some old bones in it.  I brushed it off and figured it was stuff he didn't want his grandkids to touch or mess up.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. My grandpa recently passed away this week, and my family and I were at his house, trying to pack up his belongings and either get rid of them or decide if we wanted to keep anything. We sifted through dusty boxes of old photographs, mismatched china, and forgotten toys that had once brought joy to the family, deciding what to sell, what to donate, and what to toss. One of the items we stumbled upon was that old chest.\n\nLike I remembered as a kid, it still had a giant lock on the front of it.  We considered maybe just putting the entire chest for sale as a surprise sale.  You know, a you get what you get type of thing. But eventually my dad decided to just try and open it and see if anything valuable was inside it. We all gathered around the chest in anticipation as he tried to cut the lock off. After what felt like 20 tries, the lock finally snapped off and fell to the floor with a loud thud.\n\nMy dad inched forward to lift the chest's heavy lid. The creaking of the hinges echoed ominously in the quiet room. As the lid rose slowly, our breaths caught in our throats, building suspense with every inch it revealed. My mom let out a loud gasped.  We were met with a sight that sent shockwaves through us. crammed inside the chest lay a horrific collection of old bones. Skulls jutted out, their dark empty eye sockets staring into oblivion, surrounded by a jumble of arm bones, femurs, and rib cages. We stood frozen, the reality of what lay before us sinking in with a chilling finality.\n\nMy first thought was maybe it was a collection of animal bones since he used to hunt, but the multiple skulls were obviously human.   At this point, my heart was beating out of my chest, but what made everything spiral was when my mom pointed out some newspapers tucked away on the right side of the chest. My dad pulled them out and started reading them. My stomach turned into knots when we saw the headlines, each one similar. Missing boys. Missing girls. Missing infants.\n\nMy grandfather wasn't joking after all, it was filled with a bunch of old bones. What I had thought were the playful hands of a loving man, once filled with warmth and stories, had become the chilling relics of darkness. All this time, he had been secretly kidnapping and murdering children, their bones hidden away in this chest.\n\nA wave of grim realization washed over me, mingling with a deep, gnawing regret. I was glad my grandpa was dead, yes, but that relief was overshadowed by an aching wish that we had open that chest. In an instant, every joyful laugh, every loving embrace I once cherished turned to ash. I longed for the man who had told me stories and shown me the stars, not realizing until today that the man I loved had been a monster hiding in plain sight."},"623":{"title":"The Tutorial","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f9ttqg\/the_tutorial\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"SplatterScribe","selftext":"It started like any other lazy Sunday afternoon. I was scrolling through YouTube, looking for DIY videos on home repairs, when I stumbled on a channel I’d never seen before: HelpfulHand. The thumbnail was simple—just a hand holding a wrench against a plain background. The title read: “How to Patch a Hole in Your Wall - Simple Steps.”\n\nMy curiosity got the best of me. The house I’d just moved into had its share of issues—holes in the drywall being one of them—so I clicked on the video.\n\nThe man in the video had a soothing voice, calm and confident. He walked through the basic steps: measure the hole, cut the drywall, apply the compound. It was normal, straightforward. But something about the channel felt… off. For one, there were no comments. No likes, no dislikes, nothing. And the view count stayed stuck at 13 the entire time I watched, despite how long I let the video play.\n\nI shrugged it off. New channels pop up all the time, and I figured this guy just hadn’t gained much traction yet. The tutorial worked, though. The patch in my wall was flawless by the end of the day.\n\nBut then HelpfulHand popped up in my recommended feed again. This time, the video title was “How to Cover Your Tracks – Home Edition.”\n\nI hesitated. The thumbnail was the same as before—a hand, but this time holding a hammer. It felt oddly specific, but my curiosity won out again. I clicked.\n\nThe man’s voice was just as calm as before, but the content had taken a turn. He talked about fixing things, but not in the way I expected. He was talking about hiding things—how to clean a stain so no trace was left behind, how to dispose of broken objects so they wouldn’t be found. His tone was too casual, like he was discussing routine chores, not covering up… well, something darker.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a joke. Maybe it was satire, some kind of edgy content. But as I watched, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the video wasn’t hypothetical. The steps he was giving were too precise, too methodical, like he’d done this before.\n\nStill, I watched the whole thing. I don’t know why. Morbid curiosity, I guess. I even found myself thinking about how useful some of those tips could be if, you know, I ever needed them.\n\nThe next video appeared in my feed the following day. This time, the title sent a shiver down my spine: “How to Clean Blood – Carpet Edition.”\n\nI clicked, even though every instinct told me not to.\n\nThe man in the video didn’t smile, didn’t joke. He went straight into the steps—how to clean fresh blood, how to get it out of fibers, what chemicals to use to avoid leaving behind evidence. It was graphic in its details, but what unsettled me most was the background of the video. It was… familiar.\n\nThe carpet. The layout. I knew that room.\n\nIt was my living room.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. I paused the video, staring at the screen, trying to convince myself it wasn’t true. Maybe it was a coincidence. Maybe the room just looked similar. But no—the pattern on the carpet, the light coming through the window—it was my house.\n\nI closed the browser. My hands were shaking, and I felt nauseous. How had they filmed inside my home without me knowing? I ran through every possibility—hidden cameras, some kind of elaborate prank—but nothing made sense.\n\nA notification popped up on my phone. It was from YouTube: HelpfulHand has uploaded a new video. The title made my stomach drop.\n\n“How to Disappear Without a Trace.”\n\nI didn’t click on it. I couldn’t. But the curiosity, the dread, gnawed at me. I tried to ignore it, but sleep was impossible. My mind kept racing, replaying the videos, hearing the man’s calm voice giving instructions, step by step. The way he explained everything made it sound so… easy.\n\nThe next morning, the video was gone. The entire channel was gone. I searched for it over and over, but HelpfulHand had vanished without a trace. No comments, no mentions, nothing. It was like it had never existed.\n\nBut that night, I woke to a notification on my phone: HelpfulHand is live now – How to Bury a Body.\n\nI stared at the screen, my heart pounding in my chest. The thumbnail was a grainy, low-resolution image of my backyard. I recognized the garden bed near the fence, the one I’d dug up just last spring.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I clicked.\n\nThe video feed was shaky, dark, but unmistakable. The camera was outside my house, in the backyard. The light from the streetlamp cast long shadows across the grass. The voice from the previous videos returned, low and soothing, as if it were whispering directly into my ear.\n\n“The first step is to dig deep,” the man said. “You don’t want anyone to find it. Use a shovel. Start near the fence.”\n\nThe camera panned slowly, stopping at the exact spot where I was supposed to dig.\n\nI froze, my blood running cold. There was a shovel leaning against the fence. The same one I’d left there after doing yard work earlier that day.\n\n“The next step is to make sure the body is wrapped tightly. Plastic is best.”\n\nMy heart raced as the camera moved again, this time focusing on a dark shape on the ground. It looked like a bundle, wrapped in plastic, barely visible in the darkness.\n\nThe camera zoomed in. The plastic shifted slightly. Something inside… moved.\n\nI threw my phone across the room, my mind screaming at me to get out of the house, to run. But I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed by fear, by the weight of what I was seeing. My phone buzzed again—a new notification.\n\nHelpfulHand has replied to your comment: “Your turn.”\n\nI hadn’t commented. I hadn’t said anything. But the notification was there, staring back at me. I picked up the phone, hands shaking, and opened the app again.\n\nThe livestream was still playing. The camera was closer to the bundle now. The plastic had ripped slightly, and something pale, something human, was visible beneath it.\n\nI couldn’t breathe. The voice continued, calm and unshaken.\n\n“The final step…,” the man whispered, “…is to make sure you’re ready.”\n\nI blinked, trying to comprehend his words.\n\n“Your shovel’s already outside. The plastic’s ready. You’ll know when it’s time.”\n\nMy heart stopped. The realization hit me like a tidal wave. This wasn’t a tutorial on cleaning up after a murder. It was a tutorial on preparing for mine.\n\nThe camera zoomed out one final time, and there I was, standing at the back door in the reflection of the window, watching myself.\n\nThe livestream ended."},"624":{"title":"The Irishman Under My Bed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f9xu0x\/the_irishman_under_my_bed\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"That1neBread","selftext":"Strange event December 17 2019\n\nI was in my room about to start filming a stop motion, and I was watching a video about lighting tips on the computer.

I got up and ran to the computer, but it was shutting down. Knowing that it wasn’t dead, I started to freak out a little bit.

The legend centers around an eerie stone statue of a little girl named Magda, hidden deep in the local dark pine forest.\n\nMagda was the daughter of a wealthy merchant in the late 1800s, a girl with straw-colored hair and a bright, innocent smile. She loved to play with her friends in the forest, especially a peculiar game of their own invention that was a blend of hide-and-seek and statues. The rules were simple: the children would blindfold themselves, and one person would stand by a tree in the distance, reciting a playful song while the others—blindfolded and stumbling—tried to reach them. The trick was that they could only move while the song was being sung. If the seeker caught them moving when the song stopped, the person who moved lost and was out of the game. The song is said to have gone like this:\n\n\"Come here to this pine tree,  \nWhile I am not looking,  \nBut as I turn 'round to you,  \nLike statues you must be unmoving,\"  \n(repeated three times)\n\nOn that fateful day, as golden sunlight filtered through the canopy, Magda and her friends delved deeper into the woods than ever before. The song of the game echoed through the trees as Magda, giggling beneath her blindfold, stumbled forward. But fate had something darker in store. She tripped, her foot caught on an exposed root, her head striking a jagged rock, leaving her motionless on the forest floor. Her friends stood frozen, uncertain what had happened. They approached cautiously, only to find Magda lying in a pool of her own blood, pale as a white sheet.\n\nPanic-stricken, convinced she was dead, the children ran. They left her there, alone, bleeding out in the stillness of the forest, too afraid to tell anyone what had happened until it was too late. When Magda’s body was found the next morning, her little fingers were curled into the dirt as if she had tried to crawl to safety. She hadn’t died instantly. She had lain there, cold and bleeding, waiting for someone to help her. No one ever did.\n\nHer grieving parents, shattered by the loss, built a statue of their beloved Magda on the very spot where she had died. Some say they even buried her body beneath the stone figure, eternally marking the place of her tragic death. The statue, made of old, weathered stone, its surface cracked and worn. Dry vines snake through the crevices, depicting her wearing the blindfold, her hands outstretched as if forever reaching for the seeker or the help she never found.\n\nBut death, it seems, was not the end of Magda's story.\n\nLocals whisper that if you venture deep into the forest and dare to find Magda’s statue, you can play her game once more. The legend says that Magda’s spirit, though unseen, will join you in the game. Those who play fairly and finish the game are said to be blessed with extraordinary luck, as if rewarded by Magda for keeping her memory alive. Some even claim you can hear her faint, childlike giggles drifting through the trees as you stumble blindly through the forest.\n\nBut beware—the rules must be followed. If you start the game, you must finish it. If you cheat, leave before the game is over, or break any of the rules, you will suffer her wrath. Those who break the rules leave the forest haunted and cursed forever, as if the little girl who died tragically has found a way to cling to them, her fury as strong as her desire to play.\n\nNo one knows how many have tried to play the game and failed, but those who have come back speak of nightmares, eerie coincidences, and misfortune. But if you ever find yourself in that ancient Greek forest and stumble upon a weather-worn statue of a little girl, frozen in time—remember her story. And ask yourself: are you willing to play?\n\nOriginal story  \nBy D.G VFX, D.G &amp; F.A"},"626":{"title":"Stop Hogging the Blanket","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f99z5d\/stop_hogging_the_blanket\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"mr_throwaway_2","selftext":"It got pretty chilly last night, so I decided to get under the covers.

How often does a mild-mannered, family man kill his entire family? Don’t answer that.\n\nI was in middle school when it happened. The town went into a frenzy debating what we really knew about Harold Weems. He was known as a likable wildlife photographer, now a cold-blooded killer.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty and said he was miles away when it happened. The grisly details of their deaths turned our quiet community into a media circus. Apparently the mom was found on the basement floor with her skin all chewed up. The little boy (same age as me at the time) was found skinned and dangling from an old laundry chute.\n\nAs a little boy, these stories shaped my nightmares. I became suspicious of my own father and obsessively clingy to my mother. I wasn’t the only one. Kids in my class would dare each other to go near the house. They’d get as close as they could then count out loud to see who could stomach staying near the house the longest. I never played that game but years later I would do something much, much worse.\n\nTime passed and we all moved on. The man, Mr. Weems, was able to get off with no jail time after making up some story about a woman living in the walls telling him to do it. I’m not sure. My little brain could never get past the image of the little boy dangling from the laundry chute with his skin peeled off.\n\nYears later I was in college and studying film. I needed a hit topic for my thesis documentary to swing my 2.9 GPA into favorable waters. That’s when I had the bright idea to interview the reclusive man who everyone believed was a murderer.\n\nI couldn’t believe it when he agreed to be interviewed. I was so nervous to call and my nerves were met with a chipper and upbeat reply. He said it was finally time to set the record straight. His only request was that I come alone.\n\nI’m not stupid but I am pragmatic. The man had to have been somewhere in his 70s after all this time. Not the threat he might have been in the past. The next week, I trudged my heavy JVC camcorder the 2 miles from the nearest bus stop to his doorstep.\n\nWhen I arrived, I thought I had the wrong man. This guy was much, much younger with a spring in his step and wide, green eyes that locked onto me the way a snake locked onto a mouse. He always had a little smile like he knew some inside joke that I didn’t.\n\nHe excitedly brought me into his house to set up the camera. At this point every muscle in me was screaming to get away but politeness pushed me through the door. Human beings would walk off a cliff if it was the polite thing to do.\n\nSince I’m writing this, you know that I made it out that day. It will forever live as the most haunting day of my life. Once I got inside, a dank sourness crept into my bones. The house was bad with a rank odor and I was always checking over my shoulder, certain someone was standing there watching me. But the worst part is what Mr. Weems showed me that day.\n\nIt was true, he did lure me there to set the record straight. And he let me film it all. He wants you to know. So I spent the rest of my semester making a movie about it—about Her. The woman who lived inside the walls.\n\nI hope you watch it and I hope you never visit that terrible house. Because now, I feel like I need to go back. Something inside wants me back. I’ve accidentally driven to the house without realizing several times. Only snapping out of it to find myself standing at the front door. I’m terrified of what will happen if She gets me back inside. I think it’s only a matter of time now that I know who She is. She calls herself Beezel.

Oil is an important element in worldly civilisation today and it is how everything is able to function. From cars to electricity pil plays a vital role. There are countless conspiracy theories that most of the wars in 20th and 21st century was all for oil. Our lives are dependent on oil and every pleasure that we get from our privileges, is from oil. We are not so advanced after all as we are still using something that was made from dinosaurs dying billions of years ago. The main news is that oil is running out. \n\nScience is trying its best to fund an alternative to oil. It is proving a difficult task though and how we all need it, it truly dumbs us down. A couple of weeks ago I was on the train and the doors were about to close. I saw a man running towards the train and this is a common sight. Only half the man's body makes it and the other other was stuck outside. So half the man's body was cut in half by the train doors. Instead of seeing blood, we saw oil instead. \n\nHalf of the man's body was hopping inside the train and he was confused as to why he had oil for blood. Looking outside his other half of the body was also confused as to why he had oil for blood. Some people on the train were secretly collecting some of the oil spilled on the floor in bottles. They wanted to sell it. Then as the train made it to the train stop, some guys in suits too the half hopping man away. Oil was being spilled on the floor still. \n\nAs more days went by I saw more people trying to make it onto the train just before it closes, unfortunately only half of their bodies made it onto the train. The other half was stuck outside. They all had oil fot blood and someone in a smart suit took them away. We started hearing of people sneezing out oil from their noses and bleeding out oil when they cut their fingers. They were never seen again. News started going round of the American government of turning people's bloods into oil by putting something into the air. They were doing this so that they could be free from relying on the middle east for oil. \n\nThen I was nearly late for the train and as the cut me in half, luckily I still had proper red blood. It was a pain to find the other half of my body though.

Some never stop running, at the expense of sleep, food, self-preservation… One might call it an addiction.\n\nNobody quite understands why animals love to run in wheels. I’ve seen cat-wheels in my local cat-cafes, trending videos of armadillos running on wheels. One researcher even left a wheel outside and videotaped wild mice and even slugs using it. Animals seem to be obsessed with the idea of running and running but never quite getting anywhere. Chasing an endless circle.\n\nHuman hamster wheels haven’t quite taken off yet, but I’m sure we are approaching that point. Treadmills just aren’t the same, because they give the illusion that you might end up somewhere. If you’re running in a circle, then you should understand that you’ll never reach anything. Surely even animals would be smart enough to understand this.\n\nI study the neurological condition of laboratory mice. Because they are nocturnal, I am often watching them for long hours in the night, running on their little wheels. They are docile, chubby things. With an endless supply of food and water and wheel-based entertainment. Nothing at all in their eyes other than the comfort of a worriless existence.\n\nMost of them love to run. They will sleep, run, sleep, eat, run, repeat. For hours upon hours. It can get a little unsettling, trying to make out their little white bodies in the dark, under a red-light headlamp, to avoid disturbing their circadian rhythm with white light.\n\nSometimes my eyes play tricks on me in the dark, wandering to a corner of the pitch-black room, as a white creature rushes past. Always in the corner of my eye, like an escaped mouse, like a ghost.\n\nI have an overactive imagination. It does give me trouble on these long nights, but my quick grasp of my surroundings has allowed me to capture many a-runaway mouse. Usually the little creatures will just sit outside their cage once they escape. Dumbly surveying the environment without a care in the world, as though uncertain of why they chose to leave, or how they can return to the only life that they have ever known.\n\nOf course, some of the little bastards bite you and immediately scurry under the door and into the hallway, but those are not the ones that I like to think about.\n\nMy mind often returns to why they run.\n\nSometimes a mouse will find that its wheel is stuck and doesn’t spin. Sometimes those mice will gnaw at the wheel, as though somehow instinctively knowing that it should spin, chasing the allure of the circle without even knowing that it exists.\n\nOf course, this is ridiculous and would get me kicked out of a scientific conference, but I sometimes find myself wondering if there is something more to the mice than what we can see. Or can even comprehend.\n\nSome of them don’t run in the wheels at all.\n\nThese are the odder cases. Sure, some of them don’t run very often, or avoid what they perceive as a threatening object. But these aren’t the… mice that I am talking about.\n\nThey run in circles.\n\nThe first time that I saw it, I thought that I was tired, or that there was something wrong with the wheel. But everything – the mouse, the wheel, the food – everything was fine. With the exception of this new, odd behavior.\n\nThey would run in a perfect circle, as though chasing their tail, like a dog. Wearing little circles into the bedding. Some of them would run in circles *on* the wheels, perfect circles that didn’t actually move the wheel. Loose circles, encompassing the entirety of their cage, or tight circles that barely allowed the mouse the opportunity to turn its entire body. Some of them even climbed their cage and moved in little circles on the lids.\n\nIt was… definitely odd. Unnatural.\n\nWhen animals do behaviors that are “unnatural” or not displayed in the wild, they’re called “stereotypic behaviors”. Some view them as a sign of stress, like a tiger pacing in the zoo. Others view them as a sign that the environment needs to be changed, or an artifact of domestication. Most don’t understand them at all.\n\nBut why circles? Why the dog chasing its tail, around and around and around in an endless circle?\n\nThe mice that run in circles don’t run on the wheels, I noticed one day. They seem to have gotten over this addiction to spinning, replacing it with the more thrilling urge to transform their own bodies into circles. To scratch the same itch, the same desire.\n\nIs it the running? Or is it the circle?\n\nI became a bit obsessed with the question. It was the long hours, the late nights. The mice spinning in little circles on their wheels.\n\nOut of 200 mice, maybe only half a dozen would even do the circles. It was a rare occurrence, enough to make me wonder if it was a sign of mental illness. Stimming, like in a human with Autism? An Obsessive Compulsive tic? But the mice showed no signs of any human mental health disorders. They just ran in circles.\n\nAn inner ear problem, a colleague offered. Something wrong with their balance.\n\nNo dice there either. It remained a mystery.\n\nAre the wheels causing the circling? I wondered. Or are the wheels just satisfying a primal urge to run in circles?\n\nHow ridiculous. Why would an animal want to run in a circle?\n\nSo my brain went, over and over in circles.\n\nI watched the circling mice. Their eyes completely blank, their mouths unmoving. Like little glass toys, scrabbling against the floors of their cages, the bedding worn away in little mouse crop-circles. Unblinking, hardly seeming alive.\n\nWhat is the point of a circle?\n\nTo humans, circles are often used to create protective barriers in rituals. A wall that an evil spirit, demon, or entity cannot cross. Ancient Sumerians drew circles with flour to purify and repel evil in sacred spaces. Pentagrams are done inside a circle. Signs of aliens are often attributed to strange markings or behaviors, such as the questionably legitimate crop circles.\n\nCircles also don’t make sense, logically. The circumference of a circle is two multiplied by the diameter, multiplied by an endless number. Pi – often shortened to 3.14 – has been calculated to 105 trillion decimal places by a supercomputer. But likely contains an infinite number.\n\nThe rationality of math often escapes me, but the idea of a tangible object being determined by a number that doesn’t really end is a baffling concept. Like the reality of your life being determined by a fleeting dream.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence, another baffling concept in math, forms a never-ending spiral. Such a spiral outlines a circle, does it not? A circle disappearing endlessly into the distance, or even into itself, like Ouroboros, the snake devouring its own tail. Endless destruction and rebirth. Even our own universe is a spiral, our own world a circle.\n\nEssentially circles represent life and death. Likely due to the shape of the sun, burning its place in human society, life, religion, and natural world. Circles are organic, despite their odd, smooth appearance. Uranus is a real planet, although it looks as though it were rendered in Blender.\n\nBut the mice know none of this. They just know that they have to circle.\n\nSome runners prefer to run in circles because it completely blanks out the mind, creating a dull, monotonous state. A paranoid person could argue that such a blank slate is prime for possession by something else, an easy target for something that could be summoned – say, by the creation of a ritualistic circle.\n\nMy evening has gone on too long, I’m becoming ridiculous.\n\nWith a sigh, I pull myself away from the circles in my mind, to focus on the mice. Mouse #602 is eating, check. Mouse #603 is sleeping, check. Mouse #604 is running in circles.\n\nHmm… This is odd.\n\nSometimes the mice that circle do so since birth, genetically predisposed to whatever behavior, defect, stressor, or mental condition is causing the circling. But this mouse showed no odd behavior until tonight.\n\n“Are you alright, little buddy?” I murmur, crouching in front of his cage and peering inside. Tapping his water first and checking that he still has food. “Did you hurt your head?”\n\nThe mouse is fine – nothing at all wrong, save for the strange circling behavior. I head home for a night of fretful rest, but return bright and early for my morning shift, of more clipboards and more circling mice.\n\nMore of my tired eyes scanning the mice.\n\n# 602, sleeping. #603, drinking water. #604, running circles.\n\nMy stomach drops.\n\nThe same mouse from last night is still running. He hasn’t stopped, while most of the other mice have bedded down for the day.\n\n“…Buddy?”\n\nThere is red on the cage.\n\nI crouch down again, my heart thudding desperately in my chest.\n\nThe mouse skitters in those tight, tight circles. His feet are red, raw. His eyes are empty, cavernous holes, leaking candy-red blood almost too bright to be real. And still he runs, over and over and over and over again.\n\n.\n\nI didn’t sleep at all that night. My mind – brain – heart beating in an endless circle of panic.\n\nWe had to euthanize the mouse. An infectious eye disease, the vivarium veterinarian said. Likely the same one that has been going around the lab. The mouse scratched its eyes out.\n\nIt’s odd how much the eye can bleed. But orbital blood collection is common with mice, when large quantities of the fluid are needed. The eye is a circle of blood, after all.\n\nOur lab spent the remainder of the day disinfecting and treating the other mice, to ensure that none of them caught the same affliction. However, the following day, the mice were declared disease-free, and yet they continued to run. Some normally, some in circles.\n\nHow simple an infection would have been. A disease, a parasite.\n\nThe world’s smallest animals are parasites. Of the Myxozoans, *Myxobolus cerebralis* is a parasite that causes whirling disease in freshwater salmonids. A terrifying sight to any fish farmer or hobby aquarist, due to its horrifically infectious manner, with the end result almost always leading to death. Even a surviving fish would continue to spread the disease.\n\nA fish infected by the parasite will gain neurological damage and physical deformities, causing it to spin like a whirling torpedo through the water. The infection is spread through consumption of dead fish, but if spores are released into the water, even a single drop can infect equipment, destroying tanks and causing horrific financial ruin to fish farmers.\n\nAn endless cycle of spinning fish.\n\nBrainworm, or moose sickness (*Parelaphostrongylus tenuis*), is a parasitic nematode of moose that causes them to pace in circles, unable to rip themselves out of the cycle. It too, is almost entirely fatal.\n\nI wished that this mouse disease could be explained away as a parasite. At least then, I would have a rational explanation for why they were running in circles.\n\nBut there was no rationale that made sense.\n\n“Hey,” My coworker nudges me. “Did we forget to put bedding in #46’s cage?”\n\n“What?” I barely notice that she spoke, lost in thought under the cacophony of squeaking wheels.\n\n“Look, there’s no bedding in the cage.”\n\nI glance over at wheel 46. The mouse’s home cage is indeed bare, the creature running circles on the empty plastic.\n\n“No, there *was* bedding in there this morning. Where did it go?”\n\nFrantic with confusion, I search around the wheel.\n\n“Wait, there’s a lot of bedding by the cage. Did the mouse move the bedding?”\n\nWe glance at each other. This is nonsensical – the mouse would have needed to carry every tiny piece of bedding to the side of the cage and push it through the bars. Repeat a million times, ad infinitum. Until the cage was completely bare and prepped for – more running in circles?\n\n“Why would he do that?” I ask, hoping that my coworker has an answer that I cannot think of.\n\nBut she looks as puzzled as I am. “I have no idea. It’s like the bedding teleported out of the cage.”\n\nThe mouse’s dark eyes continue to stare at nothing – or perhaps, something that we cannot see. An elusive goal that it desperately, frantically is trying to reach, as it increases speed and tightens the circle into a vice.\n\nAnd, although it may have been my imagination, the squeaking suddenly seems to have stopped altogether. I glance around the room, quickly, and notice that all the other mice have stopped running on their wheels.\n\n“Bedtime, I guess.” My coworker grabs her clipboard. “Let’s go upstairs, I’m hungry.”\n\n“Me too,” I murmur. But something feels very, *very* wrong about the sudden silence, like an impossible coincidence.\n\nOn the way out, I scan the room again just to make sure that I am not losing my mind, and that’s when I notice that none of the mice were running on their wheels. Instead, they  are all watching the spinning mouse.\n\nTwo hundred pairs of unblinking eyes, united in one pure moment of silent concentration.\n\nAd then – a second later – the moment is gone, buried amidst squeaking wheels and the pitter patter of little feet once more.\n\n.\n\nThe situation is getting worse. As though learning from each other, the behavior increases. Every day that they spend on the wheels, the circling becomes faster, more frantic, more often.\n\nSome scientists claim that wheel access causes an increase in circling behavior once the wheels are removed. But why then, do they circle instead of run? An arcane ritual that only the mice understand, conducted alone in the darkness.\n\nI think about more circles, what the shape means. Why does such a simple shape have so many meanings? Protections, rituals, doors to and from other worlds. Life, death, neurological decay. Impossible mathematical principles and alien hoaxes. All the same simple shape – a perfect sphere made of an infinite array of points, each themselves a circle.\n\nFairy rings are an entrance to the world of the Fae. You’re not supposed to step into them – those rings of mushrooms that sometimes appear, in marshes and forests. Supposedly due to nutrient allocation in the soil, but still not properly understood. Stepping into a fairy ring invites the Fae. Leaving something in a fairy ring tempts the Fae, and the Fae are unpredictable, temperamental creatures.\n\nObviously, the mice are not trying to summon aliens, and I doubt that their circling is the result of a ritualistic barrier to the supernatural, but what does it all have in common? That damnable shape.\n\nWith no beginning and no end.\n\nExcept there will be an end, I think, because the wheels are being removed tomorrow. They can circle all they want, but without the stimulus of a wheel, I expected their behavior to cease. No more exploding eyes, no more impossibly empty cages, no more horrific silences – this would all be over.\n\nJust have to hold out until tomorrow.\n\nJust have to hold out until midnight, actually.\n\nI was teetering outside the door, clipboard in hand, terrified to return and complete my last shift of observations. Would they all be waiting, staring at me the moment that I opened the door? And why did nobody else ever seem to notice that something was wrong?\n\nWas I just going crazy?\n\nObviously, everybody has the urge to run in a circle now and then, right? Give a strange little turn, do a little pace, rub circles on an object for comfort. That doesn’t make you crazy, of course not. Tics, stimming – these are fine and normal behaviors.\n\nI affix the red headlight and suck in a breath.\n\nThe room is normal. Dark, except for the grim shadow of red, barely casting enough light to see the clipboard and the little white creatures running. Their eyes gleaming in the darkness, the room silent except for the squeaking wheels and scrabbling of dozens of paws.\n\nBut all of them are behaving normally.\n\nI breath in a sigh of relief.\n\nYou’re overthinking it. Lab mice enact stereotypic behaviors all the time. Some of those are weird, like removing bedding. But it *could* happen, the mouse could have moved all the pieces, one by one, in its mouth. Not impossible. And eyes explode sometimes, it happens. Just a disease, nothing more.\n\nThe minutes tick closer to midnight.\n\nI think about minutes all the time, actually. If decimal points are endless, then time cannot really exist. Think about it – 11:59pm and one millisecond. 1.1. 1.1111111111111111 – when does 12pm ever actually begin? Are you trapped in a forever number like Pi, the clock frozen in its impossible existence?\n\n11:55pm. Just a few more minutes.\n\nA mouse does acrobatics on its wheel, another climbs into its food hopper and makes a nest out of its crumbs. Cute.\n\n11:58pm. A mouse sleeps, lazy for a nocturnal creature. Another runs so quickly that its body becomes a white blur on the wheel.\n\nAll normal and good behaviors.\n\n11:59pm. A mouse circles. I give it a cursory glance and turn away, not wanting to spend the last minute of my shift running around in my own thoughts. Just, for once, I want a break from the circle of dread.\n\nIts footsteps scrabble, like a gunshot in the quiet room.\n\nQuiet? When did the room become quiet? The squeaking of wheels has once again ceased.\n\n*No, I’m not turning around*, I think. *Just one more minute*.\n\nThe mice are looking at me again. Unnerving, their eyes trained in an unblinking, glassy stare.\n\nI finish my rounds and am forced to return to the other side of the room, where the circling mouse scrabbles in the darkness. Its body is a perfect sphere, tail to mouth like Ouroboros. Almost as though trying to bite its tail, a Sisyphean task in the darkness.\n\n11:59pm. The last minute is dragging by, as it always does. Just when you want to go home the most.\n\nI try not to watch the time, instead training on the mouse. Running, circles, circles, circles. Everything seems to disappear, blur away in the silent, dark room.\n\nI don’t know how long it is until I snap out of my trance, but my legs are suddenly aching, my mouth and eyes painfully dry. Trapped by the mesmerizing, rodentine cycle.\n\n*Hypnosis can be a circle*, I think. How much time did I lose?\n\nThe blood drains from my face when I glance at the time.\n\n11:59pm.\n\n*This is insane*. My watch must be broken, there is no other explanation. In any case, taking off one minute early is not going to get me fired. At the very least, the mice won’t tell.\n\nSo I stand up and get ready to leave.\n\n-Except my legs don’t move. They are leaden, as though molded into the concrete floor. Stiffly upright, my body won’t turn away from the spinning mouse.\n\nTerror crawls at the corner of my mind, threatening to encompass me in panic.\n\n11:59pm.\n\nThe mouse isn’t strewn in darkness anymore. A strange white glow is emanating from beside the cage, like the dim remnants of a star in the back of your eyes.\n\n11:59pm.\n\nA loud cacophony of noise brews in my head – seemingly coming from nowhere at all. A horrifically violent explosion, like an aneurism, like planetary destruction. I cannot move, I cannot breathe.\n\n11:59pm.\n\nThe mouse continues to run amidst the eternally loud interference.\n\nBelly-up, unblinking, with foggy white eyes like a dead fish. The corpse-like creature runs upside down, as though his abdomen had been broken and removed, legs glued onto a rotting back. Legs that glide the corpse through the darkness, in circles and circles and circles.\n\nThe terror and noise are greater than anything that I have ever heard.\n\nBeside the cage, the white dust no longer resembles a distant star – it is bright, bright enough to hurt, swelling spirals in the back of my unblinking eyes. Figures, symbols that I don’t understand, sequences that make no sense.\n\n11:59pm.\n\nThe  mouse continues to run – a fixed action pattern with no beginning or end, and no purpose in sight. Except there is a purpose, I realize, as the white circle continues to envelop the cage.\n\nI can see everything, and this is not the work of a demon. No alien or otherworldly creature has come to play, nothing monstrous has risen from the darkness.\n\n11:59999999999999pm\n\nNo, this is the work of our world, unveiled and bare to the eye. The coding of a biological machine, encased by atomic 1’s and 0’s, golden numbers and impossible sequences in twain.\n\nThis is reality skinned, reflected in the last moments of every dying being, etched into the DNA of every beating organism.\n\nThis is Us.\n\nThis Is Me.\n\nThe explosion of noise reaches a crescendo. A lightning-clap, and everything falls silent in my head. My body clatters to the floor, inoperable and limp. The light is fading, disappearing back into the ether.\n\nThe last remnants of my own vision are fading, disappearing.\n\n12:00am.\n\nEverything is gone.\n\n.\n\nIn the room, the mouse continues to run.\n\n\n\n  \n.\n\nLike this story?

Known for his insightful commentary on obscure games and bizarre internet phenomena, he appeared to be just another content creator. But what if everything you thought you knew about Mutahar was a lie? What if he was hiding a much darker truth?\n\nIt all started with a video that slipped through the cracks. It was a late-night upload titled “Unmasking the Truth: The Hidden Agenda,” and though it was quickly taken down, a few sharp-eyed fans managed to catch a glimpse. In the video, Mutahar hinted at a project he had been working on—something he called \"The Deep Web Projector.\" He claimed it was a game of sorts, but the way he described it seemed off, almost like he was trying to divert attention.\n\nThen, without warning, Mutahar's channel went dark for a week. When he returned, his content took a sharp turn. He seemed more agitated, his videos increasingly cryptic and filled with unsettling undertones. He spoke of shadowy figures, secretive organizations, and \"hidden truths\" that no one was prepared to hear.\n\nRumors started circulating that Mutahar wasn’t just a YouTuber; he was actually an operative working for a covert organization. Some said he was an undercover CIA agent, tasked with manipulating public perception through subtle psychological influence. Others whispered that he was an evil reptilian, using his platform to control and influence human behavior for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe most chilling piece of evidence came from a video where Mutahar described receiving an anonymous package—a vintage projector with a reel labeled “For Your Eyes Only.” Inside was footage of secret government meetings and strange rituals involving figures cloaked in shadows. The projector seemed to have had a profound effect on him, leading to increasingly erratic behavior and obscure content.\n\nAs Mutahar’s videos became more cryptic, his fanbase began to notice disturbing changes. His discussions about \"hidden truths\" and \"unseen forces\" seemed less like commentary and more like coded messages. There were rumors of sightings: Mutahar meeting in secret locations with individuals who were rumored to be part of covert organizations. Some claimed he was involved in underground meetings with figures known for their connections to conspiracy theories and secret societies.\n\nThe theories grew darker. Some believed that Mutahar, under the guise of a content creator, was actually orchestrating a larger agenda—whether as an operative of a secretive agency or a reptilian entity seeking to manipulate human behavior from behind the scenes. His content became increasingly unsettling, filled with veiled threats and warnings about the true nature of reality.\n\nFans who tried to dig deeper were met with threats and strange disappearances, fueling speculation that Mutahar was more than just a YouTuber—he was a powerful figure in a hidden world of espionage or reptilian control. His sudden disappearance from the regular YouTube scene only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder if he had finally gone underground to escape the consequences of his revelations.\n\nIn the end, the true nature of SomeOrdinaryGamers remains shrouded in mystery. Was Mutahar an unsuspecting YouTuber who stumbled upon something dangerous, or was he always part of a darker agenda? The lines between reality and illusion blur, leaving fans to question everything they thought they knew about their favorite content creator.\n\nSo, the next time you watch a SomeOrdinaryGamers video, remember: you might be witnessing more than just gaming commentary. You could be glimpsing the carefully crafted façade of an operative or an entity hidden in plain sight, manipulating the very fabric of reality. The truth might be out there, but it’s buried deep within the shadows."},"633":{"title":"I'm in the military and I have been sent to investigate strange occurrences on a base in New Mexico.

He was a man of refined tastes—a clean-cut, well-to-do gentleman who surrounded himself with only the most beautiful, the most perfect things.\n\nHis life was a testament to his pursuit of perfection. He had a lovely wife, her beauty timeless, her smile serene, her fine clothes hung neatly in their walk-in closet. He had three perfect daughters, each one a delicate reflection of their mother, their features soft, their smiles radiant. They were his pride, his joy, the living embodiments of his devotion to beauty.\n\nAnd then there were the Dobermans. Sleek, powerful, bred from the finest German lines. They guarded his custom-built home with unwavering loyalty, their presence a symbol of his control, his power over the world he had created.\n\nEverything about his life was *beautiful*.\n\nEverything was *perfect*.\n\nBut perfection is fleeting, and beauty fades with time. This truth, more than anything, fueled his obsession, his need to preserve the exquisite things that crossed his path. Women, radiant and lovely, who had caught his eye—each one more perfect than the last—were selected with care. He would bring them into his world, and then, when the time was right, they would become part of his most prized collection.\n\nIn the hidden nook of his closet, behind his wife’s dresses, was his sanctuary. It was there that he kept his most prized possessions—the faces of these women, skinned with precision, preserved in jars with their smiles forever manipulated into an expression of serene, eternal beauty. The jars lined the shelves, each face a testament to his artistry, each smile a reflection of the perfection he had captured.\n\nHe would often stand in that secret space, admiring his work, the faces of his collection staring back at him with those fixed, perfect smiles. They were his treasures, his proof that beauty could indeed be eternal, that perfection could be preserved forever.\n\nOne evening, as he sat in his beautiful kitchen, eating a perfect meal prepared by his new, lovely chef, he couldn’t help but feel a surge of pride. The previous chef had been a wonderful addition to his collection—her smile now one of the finest in his hidden gallery. The new chef was promising too, her beauty still ripening, her perfection not yet at its peak. But soon, she would join the others, her smile preserved forever.\n\nHis daughters sat at the table with him, their laughter light and melodic, their beauty blossoming more with each passing day. He watched them as they spoke, their features delicate, their skin flawless, their smiles radiant. They were growing up so quickly, becoming more beautiful with every passing moment.\n\nBeauty is perfection.\n\nPerfection is beauty.\n\nThe words echoed in his mind as he gazed at his daughters—his perfect, lovely daughters. They were the culmination of everything he had worked for, everything he had strived to create. And yet, as he looked at them, another thought began to take root, slowly, insidiously.\n\nThey were so *beautiful*.\n\nSo *perfect*.\n\nThey were everything he had ever wanted, everything he had ever desired. And they were his. The thought whispered to him, curling around his mind like a serpent. His daughters were growing up, their beauty reaching its zenith. Soon, they would leave, their perfection lost to the world, unpreserved, unprotected.\n\nHe couldn’t allow that. He couldn’t let such beauty slip through his fingers. His heart began to race as the idea took hold, solidifying in his mind, inescapable. They would be perfect additions to his collection, the final pieces that would complete his masterpiece. Their beauty, their perfection, would be preserved forever, their smiles frozen in time, unmarred by the passage of years.\n\nHis wife’s laughter drifted from the living room, but he barely heard it. His mind was already elsewhere, in the secret nook in the closet, imagining the new jars that would soon line the shelves. His daughters’ faces, preserved in their flawless beauty, would be his ultimate triumph.\n\nHe smiled, his heart swelling with love, with pride.\n\nBeauty is perfection.\n\nPerfection is beauty.\n\nAnd he would have them, forever."},"635":{"title":"Jacob The Werewolf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f99pe9\/jacob_the_werewolf\/","flair":"Video","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"[https:\/\/youtu.be\/gg2w-01gekw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/gg2w-01gekw)\n\nJacob wakes up in a dark forest, his body bruised and bloody, with no memory of what happened the night before.

I was handcuffed to the steel table, and every second of waiting felt like an eternity. I felt lost, confused, as if I was being accused of something impossible. Me, a murderer? I couldn’t understand.\n\nThe older detective looked at me cautiously, as if dealing with a cornered animal.\n\n“So, Gabriel, do you want to tell us what happened?” he asked calmly.\n\nI sighed, my throat dry, and prepared to speak. All of this still felt like a nightmare. Maybe, if I told the story from the beginning, they could understand what really happened.\n\n“It started months ago,” I began, my voice weak. “My father was very sick, terminally ill. I had spent everything I had on treatments, but nothing worked. It was on one of those nights, when I was completely desperate, that I decided to go out for a drink. I needed to drown my frustration in something.”\n\nThe younger detective was taking notes, but it was the older one who seemed to really be paying attention. His eyes never left mine.\n\n“Go on,” he said.\n\nI remembered the scene as if it were yesterday. I was in the nearest bar to my house, drinking alone at a corner table. The background music and the conversations of the other patrons seemed like distant noise, muffled by the sadness I carried. With each sip I took, the feeling of helplessness grew. My father was dying, and there was nothing I could do.\n\n“Then he appeared,” I continued. “A man I had never seen before. He approached my table and started talking to me, as if we were old friends. I didn’t have the energy to push him away. I was too drunk, too tired.”\n\nThe detective leaned back in his chair.\n\n“What did he say?”\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment, trying to remember exactly. The man, in a dark suit with cold eyes, had a strange presence, but at the time, I was too inebriated to notice the danger.\n\n“At first, he just asked normal questions, like he was curious about what I was doing there alone. The conversation flowed, and without realizing it, I started to vent. I talked about my father, about his illness, about how I felt useless. I think the alcohol made me say more than I should. And then... he asked me something.”\n\n“What?” asked the older detective.\n\n“He asked, ‘What if there was a way for your father to be cured?’”\n\nI paused, feeling a lump in my throat at the memory. At the time, I didn’t even think. I was in such a deep state of despair that anything seemed better than the reality I was living in.\n\n“I told him I would pay anything if that were possible,” I whispered.\n\nThe younger detective finally stopped writing and looked directly at me.\n\n“And what did he do?”\n\nI swallowed hard, the moment crystallizing in my mind like a vivid nightmare.\n\n“He reached out to me and said, ‘Deal.’ I laughed. I thought it was some joke, something ridiculous that the alcohol was making me take seriously. But without thinking, I shook his hand.”\n\nWhen I did, I felt a coldness run up my arm, but at the time, I thought it was just the effect of the drink. That handshake marked the beginning of everything.\n\n“And then?” the older detective insisted.\n\n“I went home, without thinking much about what had happened. And the next day, something changed. My father... my father was better. Much better. It was as if the illness had vanished, as if he had never been on the brink of death. The doctors couldn’t explain it, but I knew something was wrong.”\n\nI sighed, fighting against the tears that welled up. I thought I had done the right thing. That, somehow, that stranger at the bar had kept his promise. But I didn’t know the price I was paying.\n\n“But then... the nightmares started,” I continued. “I dreamed of deaths, of blood, of violence. It was always me, killing someone, but I never clearly saw the faces of the victims. At first, I thought they were just bad dreams, consequences of the stress. But things got worse.”\n\nI began to lose track of time. There were nights when I woke up in places I didn’t recognize, with mud and stains that I couldn’t explain. I started to fear myself, not knowing what was happening.\n\nAnd then the bodies began to appear. Violent deaths, always near crossroads. The police started calling the killer ‘The Crossroads Maniac’ because of the locations of the murders and the brutality of the crimes.\n\nThe older detective leaned forward.\n\n“Gabriel, did you know we’ve been investigating this killer for months?”\n\nI shook my head, confused. I couldn’t believe I was being accused.\n\n“You’re making a mistake. I’m not that killer!”\n\nThe younger detective pushed a tablet towards me, with a video ready to play.\n\n“Look at this, Gabriel. We recorded your last night at the crossroads. It might help you remember.”\n\nI hesitated but pressed play. The screen showed a dark road, illuminated only by the headlights of a parked car. The scene seemed normal until I saw myself on the screen.\n\nI was there, with a knife in my hand, walking calmly towards a woman who was screaming desperately. I closed my eyes and turned away, unable to watch any more. The sound of her screams still echoed in my ears as I attacked her. In the video, my face was a mask of indifference.\n\nMy stomach churned.\n\n“This... this can’t be real,” I whispered, feeling the world collapse around me.\n\nThe older detective stared at me harshly.\n\n“It’s you, Gabriel. We don’t care if you made a deal with the devil or something else, what matters here is that you are the Crossroads Maniac. And we got you, you bastard.”\n\nI wanted to deny it. I wanted to scream that it couldn’t be true. But at the same time, something inside me knew it was. I remembered the nights without memory, the nightmares. The pact had taken my soul, turning me into something I didn’t recognize.\n\nThe detective stood up, slowly walking around the table, speaking in a cold and implacable voice.\n\n“You’re going to rot in jail for what you’ve done, you bastard. There’s no escape for monsters like you.”\n\nHis words reached my ears like a distant echo. I knew he was talking to me, but I could no longer pay attention. My mind was elsewhere. My gaze was drawn to something behind the detective. Something only I could see.\n\nThere, leaning against the wall of the interrogation room, was him. The man from the bar. The same man who had reached out to me and sealed my fate that fateful night.\n\nHe looked at me intently, with a demonic smile on his face, as if he were enjoying my suffering. His eyes gleamed with malice, and although his figure was as real as anyone else in the room, I knew that no one else could see him. He was there to remind me of what I had done. To remind me that the pact would never be broken.\n\nThe detective kept talking, but his words dissolved into the air. I couldn’t take my eyes off that cruel smile, knowing that I was just a pawn in his game. I shook his hand once, and now... now my soul belonged to him."},"639":{"title":"EYELESS JACK : Rewritten Chapter 3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f93d4g\/eyeless_jack_rewritten_chapter_3\/","flair":"Iconpasta Story","author":"ThatDrbMaskiess","selftext":"Original By **Azelf5000**\n\nRewritten By  &amp; \n\n**\\~Quick notice - NathanH.\\~**\n\nWe are both fairly inexperienced writers and this is our first time doing an ambitious project like this together, and so we hope you can help us by giving criticism.

The events of this night, shrouded in darkness and dread, have left me questioning the very fabric of reality and the limits of human understanding.\n\nMy beloved Bonnie and I had ventured to Flagstaff, seeking respite from the mundane confines of our lives in San Francisco. Little did we know that our journey would lead us down a path of madness and despair, into a world where ancient evils lurked beneath the surface of reality, waiting to ensnare unwary souls like ours.\n\nAs we arrived in the snow-covered town, the air thick with a sense of foreboding, we sought refuge in a quaint bar named \"The Bright Angel.\" What began as a simple drink to unwind soon spiraled into a night of debauchery and intoxication, as Bonnie's laughter echoed through the dimly lit establishment.\n\nGuided by a strange impulse, we stumbled out into the snowy night, the moon casting an eerie glow upon the deserted streets of Flagstaff. In a haze of drunken stupor, we found ourselves standing before an abandoned house, its windows boarded up and its facade shrouded in darkness.\n\nDriven by a desperate need for shelter, I made the fateful decision to break into the house, unaware of the ancient horrors that lay dormant within its walls. The air was thick with the scent of decay and the whispers of forgotten spirits, as we ventured deeper into the heart of the forsaken abode.\n\nIn the study, I discovered a journal belonging to a man named R. Carter, whose experiments with a malevolent machine had unleashed unimaginable terrors upon the world. The pages were filled with cryptic incantations and eldritch symbols, invoking powers beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nAs I delved further into the house, I stumbled upon a laboratory teeming with arcane apparatuses and twisted contraptions, remnants of Carter's unholy experiments. The air was heavy with the stench of decay and the echoes of otherworldly whispers, as I realized the true nature of the horrors that lurked within the shadows.\n\nIn a room shrouded in darkness, I bore witness to a grotesque entity that defied all reason and logic, a being of unspeakable malevolence that lurked in the depths of the house, hungry for unsuspecting souls to devour.\n\nAnd then, in a moment of sheer terror, I saw Bonnie vanish into the darkness, swallowed whole by the eldritch abomination that dwelled within the bowels of the cursed house. Her screams echoed through the corridors, a haunting melody of despair and anguish that pierced the very fabric of reality.\n\nNow, as I sit alone in the study, the shadows closing in around me, I know that I am not alone. The ancient evils that lurk within this house have taken root in my soul, twisting my mind and shattering my sanity. The portrait of the Victorian family leers at me from the wall, their faces contorted in a grotesque mockery of humanity.\n\nI can feel the presence of dark forces stirring in the shadows, whispering malevolent secrets and beckoning me to join them in their eternal torment. In the darkness, I hear the echoes of Bonnie's screams, a haunting reminder of the price we pay for venturing into the realms beyond mortal ken.\n\nAs the candle flickers and dies, casting the room into pitch-black darkness, I know that I am doomed to wander these accursed halls for eternity, a prisoner of the ancient evils that dwell within the house of horrors. And as the whispers of the dead echo through the shadows, I pray for deliverance from the unspeakable terrors that await in the darkness beyond.\n\n---\n\nIn a moment of desperation, we found ourselves separated, torn apart by forces beyond our control. Bonnie's cries echoed through the halls, a haunting melody of anguish and despair that pierced my soul with a pain I had never known. I called out her name, but my voice was swallowed by the oppressive silence of the house, a silence that seemed to mock our feeble attempts at escape.\n\nAs I searched frantically for Bonnie, the house seemed to shift and twist around me, its malevolent presence closing in on all sides. The portrait of the Victorian family leered at me with twisted faces, their mocking gazes a cruel reminder of our impending doom. I knew then that we were lost, trapped in a nightmare from which there would be no awakening.\n\nAnd then, in a moment of heart-wrenching clarity, I found her. Bonnie stood before me, her eyes filled with a sorrow that mirrored my own. We reached out to each other, our hands trembling in the darkness, but a barrier of unseen malevolence kept us apart. I could feel her slipping away, consumed by the darkness that threatened to engulf us both.\n\nWith tears in our eyes and hearts heavy with sorrow, we knew that our love, as strong as it was, could not save us from the horrors that awaited. In a final, desperate act of defiance, we whispered our vows of eternal love, our voices mingling with the cries of the damned that echoed through the house.\n\nAnd as the shadows closed in around us, enveloping us in a shroud of darkness, I felt Bonnie's touch slip from my grasp, her presence fading into the void. In that moment of heart-rending loss, I knew that we were doomed to wander the haunted house of horrors for all eternity, forever separated yet forever bound by the love that had once united us.\n\nAlone in the darkness, haunted by the memory of a love lost to the abyss, I stood as a solitary figure in the cursed house, my soul tormented by the echoes of our shattered bond. And as the shadows whispered their malevolent secrets, I wept for the love that had been torn from me, a love that now lay buried in the depths of the haunted house, lost to the darkness forevermore.\n\nIn the end, as the echoes of Bonnie's cries faded into the void, I knew that our tragic tale would be forever etched in the walls of the haunted house, a testament to the power of love in the face of unspeakable horrors. And as I stood alone in the darkness, a broken soul in a world of shadows, I prayed for the release that would never come, trapped in a nightmare from which there would be no awakening."},"644":{"title":"Any creepypasta recommendations?

The first buds of spring had burst open, painting the hedgerows with splashes of white and pink. A warm breeze carried the sweet scent of blossoms through the air, mingling with the smoke from a few chimneys where early risers stoked their fires. Birds sang brightly from their perches in the oak trees, their melodies intertwining with the distant bleating of sheep and the chatter of villagers going about their daily routines. \n\nEldermoor was a peaceful place, where cobblestone streets wound between cottages with thatched roofs, and old wooden carts creaked by under the weight of freshly gathered hay. The villagers, with their quiet smiles and gentle nods, were preparing for the season ahead—mending fences, tending gardens, and repairing roofs before the summer sun made its full arrival. The woods that surrounded the village stretched far into the horizon, their dense canopy hiding many secrets, but none spoke of them. Life here was quiet, steady, and good. \n\nOn this lovely morning, Arthur Wolfe awoke to the cheerful chirping of sparrows outside his window. The hunter sat up slowly, stretching his arms wide and yawning deeply. The sunlight poured through the small panes of glass, warming his weathered face. He rose and dressed quickly, moving with the efficiency of a man accustomed to early hours. After a hearty breakfast of bread, cheese, and a bit of leftover venison, Arthur set about preparing for the day’s work. \n\nHe checked his rifle, tested the edge of his hunting knife, and packed a small satchel with dried meat and a flask of water. The season had come for a proper hunt, to gather meats that would sustain him and the village through the long, harsh winter, and furs to keep them warm against the biting cold. As he stepped outside, the sun climbed higher, and the forest beyond the village beckoned him with its deep, mysterious shade. \n\nArthur entered the woods with confidence, moving through the undergrowth with the ease of a man who had spent his life among these trees. The forest was thick with life; the rustling of small creatures in the brush, the flutter of birds overhead. Yet, as he pushed deeper into the shadowy glades, a strange sensation settled over him, a feeling of being watched. \n\nHe caught glimpses of something red flitting between the trees, darting behind rocks, slipping away into the high branches. At first, he thought it a fox, but no fox moved like this, with such purpose, such intent. It was always just out of reach, just beyond his line of sight. His heart quickened. He paused, listening, but the forest had grown unnervingly quiet. Even the birds had ceased their singing. \n\nDays passed, and Arthur’s hunts became more desperate, more erratic. The flashes of red continued to haunt him, vanishing before he could make sense of them. No game crossed his path; only that dreadful crimson, appearing and disappearing like a ghost. \n\nThen, one night, as the fog crept in and the moon shone pale through the canopy, he sensed something behind him. The air grew colder, his breath visible in the gloom. Arthur turned slowly, gripping his knife. And there she was. \n\nShe stood in the clearing, tall and gaunt, wrapped in a deep red cape, the hood covering her thinned, gray hair. Her eyes, wide and glinting in the moonlight, seemed to pierce through him. Her lips were pulled back in a smile too wide for any human face, revealing teeth that were long and sharp. Her presence sent a chill down his spine, colder than any winter’s night he had known. \n\nArthur knew the stories whispered in the village—of the Red Hood, a vengeful spirit who haunted these woods, luring men to their doom. He remembered his grandfather's stories, how he swore he'd seen Red Hood in his youth. The old man spoke of three questions that could save a life. \"The first,\" his grandfather had whispered, \"she answered with glee. The second, with hunger. But the third… the third would rattle her, just enough to give you a chance to escape.\"\n\nHis heart raced now, as he recalled those words.\n\nHe steadied himself and asked the first, his voice barely a whisper. \"Why are your eyes so big?\" \n\nThe woman’s eyes widened even further, glowing like the eyes of a wolf caught in a hunter's lantern. “To watch your every move, hunter,” she hissed, her voice like the wind through dead leaves. \n\nArthur felt his skin prickle with fear, but he forced himself to continue. \"Why are your teeth so big?\" \n\nHer smile stretched wider, impossibly so, showing teeth sharp as knives, dripping with some dark, unseen liquid. “To tear the flesh from your bones, hunter,” she crooned, her voice a twisted lullaby. \n\nHis heart pounded in his chest; he knew he was running out of time. The third question—the one she could not answer—hung on his lips. “Where has your soul gone?” he asked, his voice trembling. \n\nThe Red Hood froze. Her body began to vibrate violently, as if struck by an unseen force. Her eyes bulged, her mouth gaped, and a groan escaped her lips, growing into a terrible murmur that filled the air, a chorus of a thousand voices speaking at once. \n\n“My....Soul...” she hissed, her voice breaking like brittle bone. Her form shook with fury, and she began to describe horrors, short and sharp—snatches of suffering and the sounds of damned cries. “Lost in the darkness… torn from me… in the places where even shadows do not dare tread… it is with the ones who scream… scream forever…” \n\nArthur felt the earth tremble beneath him, the trees seemed to bend and groan. The whispers grew louder, the words distorted and filled with agony. He turned and fled, crashing through the undergrowth, branches clawing at his face, roots catching his feet. Behind him, the murmuring rose into a terrible wail, a cry that seemed to echo through the entire forest. \n\nHe did not stop until he reached the village, panting, sweat pouring from his brow. As he crossed the threshold of Eldermoor, the cries faded, but in the silence that followed, he could still hear her voice, her dreadful litany of horrors echoing in his mind.

For the sake of anonymity, all names, locations, and dates are going to be either generalized or made up.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my childhood friend Marcus got out of the military. This wasn't a surprise to a lot of people, but if I'm being honest, it was a little odd to me. To most, they saw how much he talked about missing home, how much work frustrated him, and how he swore he was going to kick our asses in COD the next chance he got. What surprised me, though, was that Marcus was a rule follower. That's how he'd made Sergeant in four years, after all. He didn't steal, break rules, or step out of line. The military is a great place for men like that, as far as career paths go. In the real world, not so much. Nevertheless, when Marcus invited me to his new house a few days ago, I was excited to spend some much-needed time face-to-face.\n\nI wasn't the only one who attended that night: there was our other two friends Kyle and Paul, Paul's girlfriend, and a few of his wife's friends. This was the first time we had got to see the two outside of the initial welcome home they did with their families, and without the presence of those families, it felt as if this was our first actual face-to-face.\n\nThe girls quickly took over the living room of the house with stories of drama and Tic Tok trends, so Marcus pulled us guys out to the detached garage next to the house. There, we found that there were a few lawn chairs already set up, and a minifridge with beer nestled in the corner. One might say a man's dream come true.\n\nOur conversations that night didn't differ that much from our usual discord calls: who sucked the most at video games, nonsensical questions like \"Is a hotdog a taco?\", and who was the greasiest bastard on *Trailer Park Boys*.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the drinks flowed, we began to ask Marcus about his military career, now that it was over. He was a good sport, answering our more mundane questions with laughter and half-drunk explanations of nuances we wouldn't understand even if we were sober. As we prodded, we got braver with our interrogations, until Kyle asked,\n\n\"I've been watching this guy on YouTube, right? He does like, scary stories that are about the military. Not like getting shot at but like Bigfoot and ghosts and shit, you ever had anything like that?\" Marcus' face immediately shifted from happy to uncomfortable. In retrospect, I should have been waiting for this to happen. Someone to ask a question too far; ruin the mood of the night. I guess I figured that it would have been the obligatory \"*Have you ever killed anyone?* \" or \"*Have you ever been shot at?* \" that we knew better than to ask.\n\n\"You don't have to answer that,\" Paul said quickly.\n\n\"No, no, it's okay. Just grab me another Coors, will ya?\" I nodded and stood up, going to the fridge. I was out too, and had been looking for an excuse to get out of the lawn chair.\n\n\"I've had a few incidences, funny enough they were always at home, never really overseas. I heard stories from the older guys about stuff overseas, but the supernatural stuff always happened at home for me. I know it's weird, but whatever. Anyway, you guys know where I was stationed. Big ol' airbase, right? Well, that fucker was old. Real old. My hanger was built in like the 60s, but some of the stuff on that base was there way before it was even built.\n\nWell, when I first showed up to my unit, our corporals would try to scare us younger guys by telling us about the base ghost. You can no-shit look it up, it's even on our base's webpage! Basically, back when they built the base, it was all swap and farm land. Nothing was on it but a few farms, but it's really close to some strategic inlets, which is why they built it there back in the day. One of these farms, though, had a little cemetery on it, right near where the runway was supposed to go. It was a Mom and two kids. Now, I have no clue why they did it like this, but they moved the Mom's grave to one side and the kids to the other. Well, that was a major fuck-up, because now the mother's spirit walks around the base, trying to find her kids.\"\n\n\"He's right! It's right here on the website! What the fuuuuuck!\" Paul laughed, turning his phone around to show us. Sure enough, the website was an article on the ghost of the base, and the url ended with a '.mil'. This didn't seem to cheer Marcus up, but he gave a weak smile.\n\n\"I told you, its all real. To be honest I didn't believe it at the time. I thought my corporals were just trying to fuck with me. I thought...well, it doesn't matter what I thought. The first time I saw anything, it was years after I first heard about her. About the mother. Dude, when I say it was fucked, it was literally October the first time it happened. A few days before, one of our pilots, like the one in that article, was on approach and did a go-around because he saw a woman on the flight line at like eleven at night. He did three of those until they landed. Co-pilot saw it too, said it looked like a woman was walking across the flight line, but by the time the 'follow-me' truck got over there, whatever it was, was gone.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait, how the fuck did they see someone down there at eleven at night? I can barley see those trees across the street from here and it's not even nine!\" Kyle asked.\n\n\"NVGs, man. We wear night vision goggles when we fly. You can literally see the whole runway, even when the lights are turned off. How do you think we landed in dirt airstrips overseas at night?\" Kyle's face flustered and shrugged. \"Anyway, that happened on a Friday, and the next Monday me and my lance corporal went out to take inventory of the planes like we did every morning. We did them at six a.m. every day before the work day started, and by then before the sun came up. That morning we had a fog come in off the ocean, so we couldn't really see shit. Couldn't even make out the trees on the other side of the flight line. And it was quiet, dude. No birds, or cicadas, nothin.\n\nAfter we put our stuff down in our shop like we usually did, we got to stepping. We walked out and began shooting the shit, just about dumb little stuff. Eventually, we got to talking about what had happened with that pilot.\n\n'*Dude, did you hear about what happened to Mugshot and his crew?* '\n\n'*Yeah man, crazy shit!* *I heard from James that they're going to get a talking-to from the CO, apparently the command is pissed!* '\n\nAs we talked, we got to the next plane and started up inside of it. I began filling out the inventory log, and I had a full view of my lance. He took out his flashlight and started counting the stuff we had to check off.\n\n'*Why are they pissed?* '\n\n'*Because, dude, it makes them look bad!* *Their pilots saw a ghost on the runway?* *Come on, that's hard for the CO to tell his boss.* ' THUD. THUD. THUD. A series of bangs sounded from the back of the plane. We both jumped a little, but sometimes the wind would move the flight control surfaces around, making them bang. I was a little shaken, but I just figured it had to be a coincidence. We gave each other a nervous smile, and I asked him,\n\n'*Jesus.* *What, you don't believe them?* ' He shook his head and walked over to me, finished with his counting. We stepped back out into the early morning, with my lance saving his response until we were both off the plane. The fog was a little thinner, so we could barely make out the tree line on the other side of the runway.  It was maybe a hundred, hundred fifty yards from where we were.\n\n'*Nah dude, fuck that.* *There's no way there's some ghost bitch floating across the runway-*' No sooner than he said that, a shrieking cry came from across the flight line. The scream instantly sent every hair on my body to stand at attention, and I swear my buddy's hair bristled up like a cat.\n\nOur eyes snapped open, straining wide at the early morning black, searching for any sign of movement or contrast in the weak light produced by our squadron's hanger lights. Our ears strained and itched, searching for a noise to break the unbearable silence followed by the scream. Nothing. Not a step, a tap, a crunch of gravel. We waited in silence for what had to be fifteen seconds, but it might as well have been fifteen hours.\n\n'*Did you ju-*' A second scream cut through the fog, closer this time. This time, it sounded like our side of the runway, the shriek cutting through the still air and stabbing at our eardrums with the same shrill power as an old jet engine. I instinctually covered my ears, and I wanted as my lance jumped back into the plane.\n\n'*Fuck!* ' I cursed and I ran in after him. I caught up with him pretty quickly, and grabbed the back of his collar. He flung his arms wildly and caught my cheek, but I pulled him down quickly to the floor.\n\n'*We're gonna get trapped!* *We need to go!* ' I shouted at him. THUD. This time, we knew it wasn't the wind. My buddy pointed his flashlight down the cargo hold and turned it on. Illuminated in the beam, was a middle-aged woman in a brown dress. Her brown hair was loose around her shoulders and matted like a wild animal's fur. What stuck out to me was her face.\n\nThe woman's face was illuminated in a pale grey light from the flashlight, making her skin appear a dull grey. Her mouth was snarled and her face contorted into an expression of not just rage, but desperation. Her eyes were her most inhumane feature, I swear on my own mother's grave that they reflected the light back at us like an animal's would. They were two disks of light that looked like they were more at home coming from the base of a tree line, not this woman in the back of our plane.\n\nWe were immobilized in fear. For the time being, she didn't move, and neither did we. Time seemed to stretch again, and it was dead silent in that plane. We didn't even take a breath. Suddenly, her head twitched to the left, like a bird when it hears a noise, and I swear, the most unnerving thing wasn't when she screamed, but it was the gasp she took right before. A sharp, quick inhale, but it was so quiet in there it was unmistakable. Your imagination doesn't need to breathe. Tricks of the light or hallucinations don't need to breathe, your mind goes around all those little details and focuses on the big show. But she did, and screamed so loud I thought I wasn't going to be able to hear again. I grabbed my friend, tore him off the floor, and we shoved each other through the door. We took off and sprinted across the ramp back towards the hanger, and even back when I ran track I don't think I ever moved that quick. When we got there, we slammed that door as quickly as we could and looked through the window back at the plane. Behind it, we saw the first red of dawn coloring the sky...and two pricks of light coming from the open door. We stayed in there until the sun came out in force and burnt up all that fog. By the time we were willing to come out, she was gone.\"\n\nMarcus crushed the beer can that was in his hand, throwing it into the trash. It was quiet in the garage, and my own hair was bristling. Marcus was shaking, and a bit of sweat was poking through his t-shirt. We didn't press him anymore that night, and I left a little bit after that. I've tried to rationalize it in my own head, maybe he really was just tired or sick. But that detail about the woman's breathe still gives me chills just thinking about it. Maybe you guys have a better explanation. Or maybe, there really was something in those planes."},"653":{"title":"spooky loud house 4\/20 \"creepypasta\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f8fp21\/spooky_loud_house_420_creepypasta\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Admirable_Ice3932","selftext":"one day I woke up, and my mother told me that we go to a flea market, and we got there, i learned how to read just one week ago, and found a loud house vhs tape, and it said \"lud hus - episode 0\".\n\nwhen we got home I put in the vhs, and it went on, this was a recording in, and it was recorded in 4\/20\/1969, way before nickelodeon and loud house existed, so spooky oh my fucking god.\n\nThe intro started and it had no audio, and and and lincoln had the spooky Iconic (shrimp glow) bloody eyes, it was so scary I pissed and shit my pants.\n\nThe episode started and lincoln was watching Saw II weed edition in the dark, where there was a trap where amanda had to find keys through bongs, lincoln shit and pissed his pants like me, and he got mad to the point where he wanted to kill his whole family, so when it was morning, he just killed them, I'm too bored to even do all that storyline shit.\n\nThen he got spooky photoshopped face, and then it ended.\n\nI got so scared I shit my fucking pants, so I told my mom about this vhs to send it back, but then she turned into spooky Lincoln, then killed me, and so I'm writing this in heaven to warn you about the scary vhs, and not get it, and they don't sell vhs anymore, so don't even bother\n\nevery Century on 4\/20 lincoln with spooky face will try to get you, if you buy the vhs, make sure to hide in the dumpster, and put all of the maggots on your body to hide from lincoln.\n\nthe end."},"654":{"title":"Looking for the author of the \"Fuzzy\" creepypasta.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f89byc\/looking_for_the_author_of_the_fuzzy_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"DarkArmed_Active","selftext":"I am hoping to start a creepypasta narration channel and I would love to narrate a story from my childhood called \"Fuzzy\" but I can not find the original author to ask them for permission, if someone could help me that would help me a lot!\n\n  \nThe creepypasta in question: [https:\/\/www.creepypasta.com\/fuzzy\/](https:\/\/www.creepypasta.com\/fuzzy\/)"},"655":{"title":"I am a mothers boy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f87yij\/i_am_a_mothers_boy\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"My mother had been kidnapped a year ago and I have been lost ever since.

A thing as simple and fickle as getting code names had gotten them to stop sulking over their terrible introductions in part 1. William made sure to look over at you just to make sure you were still aboard the Angel Hunters flagship after that shipwreck of an introductory into the supposed wicked world of “Dark Fiction” that the author swears is not quite like any other subgenre and so he just has to call it this. Phew. Okay. You’re still onboard and not overboard somewhere, drowning in an attempt to get the hell away from this ghostship. Great! William thought before starting:\n\n“Linda. Your code name is Wraith. Nano. Yours is… Nano. And Nero. Yours is ‘the Beast.’ Use your code names any time we are in the field. Hmm. I suppose I should pick one for myself. I’ve never used one considering my stories a bit grittier. Meh. I suppose you could all continue to call me Sensei. Great. Hope everyone likes their name. If not too bad.”\n\nNero rooted and hooted like an unstoppable maniac Animaniac on the loose. Suddenly he paused mid fist pump and hopped from off the top of the desk he had somehow managed to balance himself atop with such great skill. Huh? He didn’t actually know the meaning of his code name ‘the Beast’ he had just spent all this time rooting for like a bloke. I mean there was the guy from Marvel, “Beast,” but that wouldn’t have made any sense because that guy was super smart, and he was... Wait! Was he about to call himself not smart?! Which would imply he was er... never mind.\n\nLinda basked in his befuddlement. It was a rare occurrence of quietness from someone usually so skilled at being a nuisance. Feeling sorry for him, she whispered playfully into his ear that she would do him a solid by googling away his vexation. Her fingers went to work. She giggled wildly when his eyes nearly popped out of his head in shock when he saw the search results. It was fitting for a jerk like him she thought. *But* her code name, oh my God! Totally to die for! Seriously she fell head over heels for it as soon as it rolled off the tip of Sensei’s tongue. Think about it. Put her two professions together and it was epic word salad: *“Shinobi Wraith.”*\n\nNano watched all of this unfold with a bitter indifference only something or someone who was possessed by the spirit of AI could muster. His blue irises flashed with numbers as he connected to the Core Matrix in a pointless attempt to understand human behavior. If he was going to “destroy you and all of humanity” like he had promised, he would have to understand why you and all of humanity acted the way you did. The realization was bitter and filled with irony as rich as a box of chocolates he couldn’t help but share as he looked over at you with another one of those lovely death stares, he also loved to share, but *not* like a box of chocolates!       \n\n“Settle down class. I have another announcement to make. Now. Before we continue to our field training, I should introduce the person in charge of all major operations. She’s a woman who needs no introduction. The AI Matrix she constructed from the ground up is crucial in maintaining our underground facilities. It also plays a critical role in advancing our ultimate doomsday project. Please applaud the prestigious Doctor Susan Jane.”\n\nWilliam’s longwinded announcement was a bit confusing. It became something of a controversy when he opened the door, and a young girl entered the classroom. She walked over and greeted you rather professionally for a teen. Her smile matched the deepness of her woodland green eyes that burned with curiosity like a forest fire. A know-how like a robin or hoodlum wading through Sherwood Forest. She was a pleasant girl who was hard to forget. Another thing that was hard to forget was how her lab coat barely fit. Her arms had been chewed up by the rolled up, crumpled up sleeves. The bottom of her coat seemed bottomless as it dangled dangerously close to becoming a broken magic carpet. Surely William would explain away the whole thing as some kind of practical joke. Ah. Or maybe the esteemed doctor had been hit with a shrink ray?\n\nWilliam took a step back and gestured with his hand that the floor was hers. Seeing this she gave you one more studious look, William a studious head nod, and then stood studiously before the class. A moment or two was spent flipping and studying the pages secured to her super important clipboard before she cleared her throat and spoke:\n\n“Um. Greetings class. I will be your squad’s coordinating officer. There is a lot to be done, and I’d like to get to work right away. I reviewed all three of your profiles extensively. Each one of you were selected for a reason. So please. Try to take your training seriously. My evil plan depends on the three of you being competent enough to destroy the world. Sounds cliché, doesn’t it? I suppose all supervillains have that one bit in common no matter how ‘realistic’ or ambitious the narrative. But in all seriousness. We are totally going to bring it all crashing down! Starting with America. It’s *so* close to collapsing! All it needs is a teeny-tiny—”\n\n“Is this some kind of joke?” Nero rudely interrupted.\n\n“Why? Was my speech a little too cheeky? Tch. I kind of thought that would be the case. People have been predicting the fall of America for years now. I feared my speech would come off like *the Boy Who Cried Wolf,* or in my case ‘the girl,’” she smiled.\n\n“No. That’s not it.”\n\n“Then what is it?”\n\n“You’re a kid.”\n\n“I’m like five years younger than you.”\n\n“Bah! I’m not taking orders from a kid.”\n\n“Hey, Nero,” Nano said in a flat tone.\n\n“Huh? What do you want AI boy?”\n\n “If I were you, I would watch how I spoke to her. Don’t let her size fool you. She can turn your life into a living nightmare.”\n\n“Hah! I eat living nightmares for breakfast,” he said with smoldering intensity.\n\nLinda rolled her eyes and said, “Gah. Do you ever stop?”\n\n“No. I don’t. I escaped from Hell and have been running ever since! I don’t remember my escape, but I was told I did by the angels who found me. That had to be the lowest point in my life. But that’s not the point! The point is... uh. What was the point? Oh yeah. That’s right—what can ‘Doctor Pint-sized’ do to me if Lucy couldn’t stop me from escaping Hell?! That’s right! The angels couldn’t stop me from ditching the Holy Order either! The forces of dark—\"\n\n“I’ll tell you what I can do,” Susan smoldered even harder. Her face burning red with anger as she stared him down with a murderous glint in her eye like someone who had carved into a pumpkin with a meat cleaver. “You better take your training serious! The fate of the Illuminati depends on it! If you fail—any of you for that matter—fail to become proper Angel Hunters—you’ll scorn the day you were born. First, I’ll wait for you to sleep, or in your case, Nano, I’ll power you down. I’ll wait too. Heh. I’ll wait until you’re nice and fat with forgetfulness before I have my friend Sarahiel kidnap you and bring you to my lair deep down in the bowels of Bunker 17. Then I’ll trap your body inside the same bio-caskets we use to keep legates alive. But instead of letting you drift away into peaceful cryostasis, I’ll hijack your brain and upload your mind into my virtual reality matrix. Hah! That’s right! My master simulation is nothing like the cheap stuff we allow on the civilian market. What I’ve created feels just like the real thing thanks to my AI Matrix. Not only that, but I can program it to overload your synaptic connections so that you feel pain and fear tenfold natural human biology. Then I’ll override my AI Matrix and make sure you relive your worst freaking nightmare again and again—in slow time for a trillion artificial life cycles!”\n\nNero fell out of his chair in shock. Linda covered her eyes and peaked over at her as if she were already trapped inside the living nightmare. Nano smirked for the first time probably ever when he processed their reactions. Then with the same devious smirk hanging from his face, he said, “I won’t let you down, mother. I won’t allow these two knuckleheads to do so either. We will destroy the world even if I have to drag them along kicking and screaming.”\n\n“Good,” the curious doctor said as she happened upon an idea. She placed her pen to her lips and then smirked as she thought about it. “Nano. I think I’m going to make you squad leader.”\n\nNero jumped to his feet and cried out in protest, “Now hold on a second there! Why does he get to be the leader?! And why did he call you mother?!”\n\n“Because I created him. Duh,” she replied.\n\n“So many questions,” Linda muttered.\n\n“Now is not the time,” the doc said before turning to you and adding, “I’m sure all of this talk-talk-talk is starting to bore-bore-bore the Neutral Observer because I hate it.” Then she glanced at her clipboard before jotting something down. “Hmm. Are you guys ready for your first mission or what?”\n\n“Yes!” Nero roared. “Let’s take down a guardian angel—no, a cohort of paladins! I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” he paused for a moment and glared at Nano, growling, “You better stay out of my way. I’m the chosen one not you. If you get in my way, I’ll show you with my fists why I’m the Beast when I knock a few circuits loose on your motherboard!”\n\n“You’re not as strong as you think,” he replied.\n\n“I’m stronger than you,” Nero fired back.\n\n“No, you’re not,” Nano said.\n\n“There’s only one way to find out.”\n\n“Meh. You’re not worth the effort.”\n\n“Chicken.”\n\n“Rooster.”\n\n*“Whaaa!”* Nero exclaimed as he dashed in front of Nano’s desk at blistering speed. The velocity at which he traveled caused Nano’s long dark ponytail to rustle like a tree branch caught in a violent windstorm. Even the front legs to his desk rattled and rocked. Nero sneered and waved around his fist. His power was undeniable. Almost as undeniable as his tantrums. “You don’t know how bad you just messed up computer boy. Nobody calls me a rooster. *Grr!”*\n\n“I’m shaking in my computer case.”\n\n“Oh yeah?! Meet me outside in the courtyard!”\n\n“Nero, sit down!” the kid doctor shouted.\n\n“He started it first, Wicked Stepmother!”\n\n“Wait. What did you call me?”\n\n“Wicked Stepmother Susan.”\n\n“This is hopeless,” she pouted.\n\n“The name suits you,” William told her.\n\nShe couldn’t believe her ears. Not only that but she refused to even acknowledge the smug look on his face. Ever since she had been cloned, her temper had become something of an inside joke. She knew the nick was going to stick. It was only a matter of time before her colleagues down in Bunker 17 found out about it. Her cheeks reddened at the thought and at wanting nothing more than to blow up into a million pieces. “Fine. I suppose I could use a code name too. Even though it’s not really a code name. Thank you, Nero, for your unintentional assistance.”\n\n“Hah! No problem,” he replied.\n\n“Don’t let it happen again!” she erupted.  \n\n“Okay, jeez,” he said before creeping back down in his desk and mumbling, “Wow. Wicked Stepmother really means business. I better be careful.”\n\nLinda giggled and said, “You don’t have a careful bone in your body.”\n\n“I do have a careful bone!” he retorted.\n\n“It’s not in your skull,” she laughed.\n\n“Stupid ninja girl,” Nero groused like an angry goose.\n\nShe stuck her tongue out at him, “Corky rooster.”\n\nNero threw his hand up in dramatic fashion. It was clear he was trying to get Wicked Stepmother Susan’s attention. She did her best to ignore him, but it was too much. She just couldn’t stand his shenanigans any longer and relented, “What is it now, Nero?”\n\n“Linda keeps tease me.”\n\n“Linda, stop teasing Nero.”\n\n“I will if he stops gaslighting me.”\n\n“Nero, stop gaslighting Linda.”\n\nThe two glared at each other before folding their arms and stewing like a pot of gumbo. The job was going to be tougher than she initially thought, Wicked Stepmother thought to herself with a hint of sadness. She gazed at you, right when doubt was deepest. Her expression said everything and nothing. You could feel her pain, but not really because the whole thing was still kind of new and confusing. Being so blatantly thrown into the line of *fire* like this. I mean. Surely this must seem ridiculous to a mature, knowledgeable, and cultured person such as yourself. It better be because that’s what Wicked Stepmother believed, and Wicked Stepmother was *never* wrong! *Ever!* She could see the smirk on your face. *Err!* Maybe just maybe you were another Nero? This was only the second part to what was going to be a very long series. And your profile was redacted by Ark Haven himself, making you truly a mystery and curiosity as hard to crack as a macadamia.\n\nYep. She had spiraled but *you* were someone worth spiraling on and on about like a good song. A song that sticks like candy to your teeth. She hoped you were fun to be around like a party with good music. It would be really cool because the two of you could grab ice coffees at Starbucks one day and just talk. Um. Yeah. 13-year-olds drank coffee! Meh. Maybe you were one of those boring adults who objected to drinking coffee because you found everything ‘objectionable’ like Sensei William Chosen. Hmm. Well in that case, she could pick your brain about the Shadow Network, over a smoothie, just in case she needed to assassination one of her rivals.\n\nShe just knew that you were special and promised herself that she’d find a way to upload your mind into her AI Matrix. Stealing your brain would be totally worth it! The dopamine rush alone was worth the price of admission. Just image examining and then mapping *your* mind as a unique personality inside of her ultimate simulation. It was an idea that filled her with guilty joy! Almost as much guilty joy as eating an Almond Joy! Oh, or that one time when adult Wicked Stepmother and her DPI colleagues almost reactivated the stolen angelic gateway way back in the day. It was an impossible nut to crack, kind of like you, but getting that clunky artifact going would’ve really kicked their plans for the apocalypse into hyperdrive. Oh well. There’s always tomorrow.\n\n\n\n[**[Nero 01: New Recruits P1]**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RingocrossStories\/s\/Vtp2WdCMf9)\n\n**[Nero 03: Q&amp;A] [TBA]**"},"658":{"title":"Journal Entry 2: College","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f81mz7\/journal_entry_2_college\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"The_Real_Nyooom","selftext":"August 28, 2024\n\nHey again.

As far as I can remember it has been a part of me since birth. Only my mother and the doctors know about it. It has tormented me my entire life and has been the source of my constant migraines. I hate it and no medicine has ever helped my condition, in fact, it just makes it worse.\n\nAs a child, my mother did everything to hide it from my classmates so I wouldn’t be bullied for it. I was the quiet kid, no one spoke to me and I spoke to no one. I’ve always been a loner, The Voice says we don’t need anyone but each other. It speaks in a deep soothing voice that would calm me if it wasn’t so malicious.\n\n“Feed me.” The Voice would say constantly. It can taste but it can’t feel, its only form of worldly contact is through food. Its favorite is meat, red meat to be exact. It would beg for food at all times of the day, like a prisoner of my mind begging to be free from its eternal chamber of nothingness.\n\nWhen it wasn’t hungry it would torment me endlessly.\n\n“You are weak, useless. This body you’ve been blessed with, and you’ve accomplished nothing with it. You are a waste of a life.”\n\nIt would say things like that all the time. I’ve tried to not let it get to me but to be honest, it does. I’ve cried myself to sleep many nights, believing The Voice's vile words it would say.\n\n“If our mother would have blessed me instead I would do so much more than fucking waste away like you.” The Voice spewed\n\n“Stop it”. I muttered through sobs “Please just leave me alone.”\n\n“Like it or not we’re stuck with each other, we need each other, we can’t live apart brother.”\n\n“Don’t you fucking call me that you parasite.” \"My head began to pulsate painfully\n\n“You can’t deny what we are brother, it’s in our blood.”\n\nIt isn’t my brother it’s a monster, a horrible apparition made to serve its sole purpose of making my life hell. This demon hitched a ride using me as a vessel to come into this world.\n\nThe headaches become worse the hungrier it gets. It tortures me to get what it wants, I can feel a numb, stinging pressure on my brain whenever it wants to hurt me. I just want it to stop, to leave me alone, to get the hell out of my life.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere brother, feed me.\"\n\n\"Go to hell.\" I said knowing what came next.\n\n\"Feed me brother.\"\n\n\"NO!\" I yelled\n\n\"FEED ME FEED ME FEED MEEEEEE!!!\" The Voice screamed\n\nMy head instantly felt like it was going to burst, I exclaimed in pain and the voice continued screaming.\n\n\"FEED MEEEEE BROTHER!!! FEED FEED FEEEED!\"\n\n\"FUCK! OK OK, I'll feed you.\" I said defeated, just wanting the pain to end.\n\nI went to the refrigerator massaging my temples, and found some ground beef. I went to open it but The Voice yelled \"NO!\" startling me a little\n\n\"What do you want?\" I whimpered\n\n\"Not that, I'm sick of cold meat, I want something fresh.\"\n\nThis was new, it wasn't the first time it had complained about what food I fed it but, it didn't want meat. Meat was the only thing I fed it that made the headaches go away completely.\n\n\"Go find me fresh meat brother. FRESH MEAT!\"\n\nThe Voice knew I hated it when it yelled at me, every time it yelled my head rattled and quaked in agony. My pain is its leash on me, it hurts me to get what it wants. A tear rolled down my face, feeling absolutely agonized.\n\n\"I'll get you whatever you want, just please stop yelling.\" I sobbed\n\n\"Whatever I want? Brother, you spoil me.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard finding an alley cat this late at night. Using the ground beef to lure it over to me, I picked it up carefully and the cat purred in my arms. Tears were still rolling down my face, I didn't know if I could do it.\n\n\"I'm sorry little kitty, I'm so sorry, please forgive me.\" I said through choked-up tears. The cat looked at me trusting that since I fed it, I wouldn't hurt it.\n\n\"do it.\" The Voice whispered to me.\n\nThe cat's head didn't cave in how I wished it did when I swung it down against the pavement by its hind legs. I can still hear its final yowl as it was in motion. It sort of seized up and went stiff but it wasn't dead, it was in pain. Oh god, I'm so sorry little one. I swung it against the pavement again, its skull cracked, blood and pink brain matter spilling out this time, I knew it was dead then. I wished I were dead then, I vomited and fell to the ground bawling my eyes out.\n\nWhat had I done? What was I capable of doing? The Voice just laughed as I stared at the dead cat in the alley, knowing it now had full control over me to do whatever it wanted.\n\n\"Now brother, feed me.\" The Voice said calmly\n\nThe bones cracking reverberated in my head as they were chewed up. Blood ran down my neck and I just sat there and sobbed. Chewing and devouring the dead cat right there in the alley, my headache was gone. I was free of pain, but for how long? This cat paid for my relief but, it wasn't really a relieving feeling it was absolute dread.\n\nEvery night I would go out and do this at the behest of The Voice. finding cats, birds, whatever animals I could find whenever the voice would hurt me. I hated hurting these innocent animals, I really did but the pain was unbearable. It felt like a thousand knives being plunged into my skull over and over again. It only went away now with fresh animal meat, I wish I had talked the voice into just eating the ground beef like it had been for years. I, however, made hunting and killing these poor creatures the norm and The Voice expected it now. Until one night, it didn't want it.\n\nI had just finished snapping the bird's neck when The Voice said \"No more brother, these animals can't fulfill me anymore.\"\n\nI tearfully said, \"No, please just eat the bird.\"\n\n\"I DON'T WANT IT!\" The Voice's scream echoing through the alley\n\nI whimpered \"PLEASE! God just eat the bird. please.\" I sobbed,\n\nSuddenly an all too familiar pain shot through my skull like a bullet. I screamed in agony, certainly waking the neighbors but I didn't care. I was at the mercy of The Voice and it knew that. I was scared, I would do anything to make this stop, to make the pain end. Anything.\n\n\"You're life is going to be a living hell until I get what I want.\" The Voice snarled\n\nI didn't sleep that night, the pain was so unbearable I could hardly even make it back to my apartment. I fell over in the kitchen and writhed in pain on the floor. I was crying, yelling, and banging on furniture begging The Voice to free me of my torment. It was the most painful migraine I had ever experienced. It was conditioning me, manipulating me, pain being the all-powerful variable in controlling my actions.\n\n\"Do exactly as I say or this will NEVER end.\" The Voice growled\n\n\"anything.\" I whispered, \"please, I'll do anything.\" I begged as morning light came\n\nThe next day I was drowsy and tired beyond any tiredness I'd ever felt. My eyes were swollen from crying all night and my headache was numb now. The Voice promised to keep my headache at bay so long as I followed the plan. I was broken, years of buildup from the torment and agony I'd felt my entire life were leading up to this.\n\nI wore a hat, sunglasses, and a face mask. Weird looks from passersby but no one questioned my outfit. I drove into town, almost falling asleep a few times but the voice would startle me awake.\n\n\"HEY!\" The Voice would scream and I would swerve back into my lane. My hands were sweaty and shaking as I came to the local shopping mall. Sweat rolled down my forehead and I had to take off my mask to keep my composure during this heatwave. I was dizzy almost not knowing what I had to do. Almost. I found my target, A little boy whose mother was too busy shopping at Rue 21 to pay attention to her son.\n\nI lured the boy over to me.  \"hey you\". I whispered, the little boy almost didn't hear me and he walked over to me. The mother and employees were too busy or distracted to notice as I held the boy's hand and told him I'd take him to get ice cream. I was trembling as we walked out of the mall, this was INSANE, no one even batted an eye at what looked to be a father and son leaving the mall together on their way to get something sweet. The Voice silently chuckled, its demented plan being carried out by me.\n\nI could feel my blood rushing through my entire body. The pressure felt like my veins were going to burst like a hose and spew everywhere.\n\n\"H-Hey there's our stop.\" I said pointing at the ice cream parlor.\n\nI wasn't lying to him, I took him to an Ice Cream parlor and he wanted moose tracks. My head throbbed and the voice whispered for me to follow the plan. Part of me wanted to be caught, I wanted someone to stop us and ask the boy if I was his father but it never happened. I at least wanted the little boy to have one last good memory before I continued the plan. As we drove away my phone buzzed with an amber alert. My heart raced almost out of my chest as I pulled up the alert and read.\n\n\"Child Abduction- Indianapolis IN, 5-year-old, blonde male taken from shopping mall wearing blue race car shirt and cargo shorts.\"\n\nIt was for him, I felt lightheaded, I wanted to pass out, I wish I did, I wish I were dead. So many things I wish had happened instead. I wanted to take this boy back to his worried mother, a reunion I begged for. Tears once again welled up in my swollen eyes as we made our way home.\n\nOnce we were inside the boy asked if I had any more ice cream. Looking at him and his chocolate-smeared face I smiled. \"Sure bud, we have-\"\n\n\"NO WE DON'T!\" The Voice screamed as I put my hands to my head. The boy jumped and looked frightened at my sudden change in demeanor. I went for the freezer, A million needles seemingly piercing my skull as I pulled out an ice pop to give to the boy.\n\n\"I want blue.\" He said,\n\n\"too fucking bad.\" The Voice whispered\n\n\"Go watch cartoons buddy, I have all the cartoon channels.\" I said crying\n\nThe boy lit up, not knowing or understanding why I was crying went over and found the remote, to my surprise he knew exactly how to work my TV. My head pounded like a sledge hammer repeatedly slamming my skull.\n\n\"THIS ISN'T THE PLAN!\" The Voice hollered\n\nI fell to the ground curling up into a ball \"I can't, please just-\" A sharp jab ran straight through my brain causing me to exclaim.\n\n\"FEED ME BROTHER! FEED MEEEEEEE!\"\n\n\"Please, just-\" I screamed as it felt like my brain was being pulled from all directions\n\n\"YOUR LIFE WILL BE THIS! NOTHING ELSE UNTIL YOU FUCKING FEED ME YOU ROTTEN SHIT!\"\n\n\"I can't\" I whimpered as my tears pooled under my cheek on the cold tile floor.\n\n\"THAT BOY IS SHIT! FUCKING NOTHING! YOU WILL FEED ME! AND I PROMISE YOU IF YOU DON'T THIS CAN BE SO MUCH WORSE!!!\"\n\nSobbing, and without saying a word I got up almost slipping on my tears and slobber. I went for the kitchen knife, the big one like in the movies. I didn't want to believe I could do it, it wasn't in me. The boy would be fine, I can't possibly do this. I walked behind the couch the little boy knew I was there but he was clearly scared and didn't want to look. He clutched a couch pillow in fear as I raised the knife. Tears and snot covered my face and I was hyperventilating, The Voice chattered teeth in excitement for what I was about to do. I'm so sorry, I'm so fucking sorry.\n\nI brought the knife down into the boy's chest, through the T-rex on his graphic tee piercing his lung. He didn't even have time to let out a scream. I pulled the knife from his chest and He fell to the floor gasping for air. Blood pooled in his mouth foaming out slowly. He stared at me and began crying, clutching his chest. I looked down at his bloody face wincing at every attempt to breathe. I turned away, I couldn't bear to watch this horrible sight any longer as I cried for his life. a minute went by before the boy went silent. A life snuffed out by me, it was my choice, I did it selfishly to ease my pain. The Voice didn't control my actions, I did, and it made me sick.\n\nI ran to the sink vomiting and slipped on my pool of saliva and tears. vomit ended up all over the cabinets and didn't make it into the sink. Crying harder than I'd ever cried in my life I banged my hand against the counter. What the hell had I done? I didn't want to believe that there was a dead little boy in my apartment. But there was and I couldn't run from it.\n\n\"feed me.\" The Voice whispered to me \"feed me brother.\"\n\nI wailed \"Oh God! WHY! FUCK WHY!\"\n\n\"it'll all be better soon brother, trust me.\"\n\n\"I CAN'T TRUST YOU! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST\" I sobbed \"WHAT THE HELL HAVE I DONE?!\"\n\n\"do you feel that?\" The Voice said \"Relief?\"\n\nMy headache was entirely gone, not like before but like it never even existed. For the first time I could remember I felt nothing in my head, no pain, no numbness. Absolutely nothing. I couldn't help but laugh, through wet tears and snot I laughed. not for what I just did but for what The Voice just said. He was right, I felt relieved, I'm ashamed to admit it but I was so relieved. I could finally know a life without pain, but that little boy paid the ultimate price for my selfish bliss. It was euphoric, it was sickening.\n\n\"I can keep it that way forever brother, no more pain, please just feed me.\" my brother whispered calmingly\n\nI smiled \"OK\" breathing a sigh of relief \"I will feed you brother.\" I said, my psyche completely broken giving into his will.\n\nI walked over to the dead boy and saw his lifeless eyes seemingly lurking through the room. Although that was impossible, His glare shot straight at me, making eye contact. I felt scared and naked standing there like I was caught watching porn, I leaned over to puke but nothing came out but a large burp, and I gagged. still, I picked up his bloody corpse and brought it to the empty sink. His eyes kept contact with mine the entire time as I lay his small body into the sink. I grabbed his hand, lifted it up, and began sawing it off. Blood squirted out in all directions and the bone got caught on the serrations of the knife. Struggling I snapped his bones in his wrists and sawed through the rest of the limp flesh. He still stared at me as I pulled his hand off, stretching skin from the rest of his arm.\n\nHolding this hand devoid of a body I brought it to my mouth. Crunching down on half his index and middle fingers and tearing it off into my mouth. It tasted disgusting but still warm, like dinner cooked half an hour ago. The bones crunched in my teeth getting stuck between them and jabbing the inside of my mouth. I gagged and vomited this time bloody foamy vomit spewed up from my throat.\n\n\"feed me brother, oh sweet, sweet brother.\" He whispered longingly\n\nCrying and bleeding out of my mouth I said \"Please no more headaches, you have to promise before I'll feed you.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" he said quietly and reassuringly. I felt trust in him this time, like I'd never felt before.\n\nI raised the rest of the hand to the back of my head, moving away hair where my brother's mouth sat inside my body. His teeth bit down on part of the hand and I pulled it away, tearing flesh from popping bone. Warm juice ran down the back of my head, neck, and back. My brother chewing and crunching the hand felt rattling in the back of my head. With every snap of bone and tearing of flesh, I felt it resound through my head painfully, but I knew it wasn't on purpose.\n\n\"More brother.\" He said squeezing bloody flesh between his teeth\n\n\"OK,\" I said a single tear rolling down my face, a smile widening as I raised the rest of the wrist to his mouth. As the bones painfully split in the back of my head I laughed leaning against the counter and so did my brother as I made us lunch from the staring boy's corpse. I was finally free of my life of pain, and that's all I've ever really wanted. I can finally live a normal life and I couldn't be happier."},"663":{"title":"CreepieStory #001 | So we thought it was a prank (horror short story creepypasta)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f7vxvc\/creepiestory_001_so_we_thought_it_was_a_prank\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"INSNE_creator","selftext":"New Horror story is LIVE:\n\nCreepieStory #001 | So we thought it was a prank (horror short story creepypasta)\n\n \n\nSinopse:\n\nIn this chilling story, two best friends, set out for a glamorous party, unaware that their night of excitement would turn into an inescapable nightmare.\n\nWhat starts a possible joke soon spirals into something much darker.

People even started to even like Satan because he was getting people to worship God. That's when alarm bells started to ring when people started to find Satan to being a good guy. I observed further as to why Satan was aggressively getting people to worship God. People started to become super religious and Satan was smiling. There was something wrong about this and people were worshipping the true God that created everything. \n\nThen as people started to become more religious that they started to ignore every day responsibilities. House chores will be left unchecked and bins won't be collected and places started to become messier. Then the religious folk started to attack each other do to disputes over god. They started becoming prideful and judgemental towards those who were less religious. They are started to become jealous and envious to those who were more religious. It became a competition and then the murders started happening. They were worshipping god but sinning so much at the same time. \n\nPeople became so religious that they started murdering each other because they had difference of opinion. This was what Satan wanted when he started to make the people become hyper religious. Starving babies would be left crying while religious parents would just pray and pray. Beatings and other form of parental abuse started to form towards children, if the parents thought that their kids weren't religious enough. The whole town was like a dead town and nothing seemed to be working anymore. Everything was closed apart from places of worship to the one holy God. \n\nI tried to stop people from becoming hyper religious and I tried stopping them from worshipping God, but Satan got the hyper religious community to nearly kill me.

The house had a quiet, melancholy air about it, as if it had been waiting for someone, anyone, to fill its empty rooms. On their first day, they unpacked with the tired efficiency of people trying to outrun the weight of their own thoughts. But as the afternoon light faded, their cat, Chewy, slipped through the front door and vanished into the twilight.\n\n\n\nBy the time the sun had dipped below the horizon, Chewy was still nowhere to be found. A creeping anxiety gnawed at Sarah, but she hesitated before venturing out to search. Finally, she and Alex stepped out into the cool evening, their footsteps hesitant on the unfamiliar streets. Sarah knew what she had to do, but it filled her with a quiet dread. She had to call for Chewy.\n\n\n\n“Cha-cha-chewy,” she began, her voice faltering. She paused, swallowing hard, before continuing. “Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?”\n\n\n\nThe call hung in the air like an echo of a memory. She could almost feel her husband’s voice mingling with hers, as it always had when they called for Chewy together in those simpler days. He had come up with the silly chant one afternoon when Chewy had gone missing for the first time. They’d laughed about it, the absurdity of it all, and somehow, it had stuck. Now, every time she uttered the words, she felt the ache of his absence, a shadow that lingered just out of reach.\n\n\n\nDoing it here, in this strange new place, was more than just embarrassing—it felt wrong, like she was dredging up something best left buried. She imagined the unseen neighbors listening, and the thought made her cheeks burn. But there was no sign of Chewy, no soft meow in response, only the heavy silence of the night.\n\n\n\nAs they wandered through the winding streets, Sarah noticed that the neighborhood seemed to shift around them, the houses blending together in the dim light, becoming indistinguishable from one another. They turned a corner and came upon a street post plastered with old flyers. The papers were yellowed and brittle, and each one bore the image of a different lost cat. The sheer number of them sent a chill crawling up Sarah’s spine. Some of the flyers looked as though they had been there for years, untouched by time, the ink faded to ghostly impressions of what once was.\n\n\n\nThey were about to turn back when an old man shuffled out of the shadows, his movements slow and deliberate, as if he had all the time in the world. His eyes were cloudy, his smile thin and uneasy, like the answer to a question no one had asked. “Lost your cat, have you?” he rasped, his voice a dry whisper that seemed to blend with the wind.\n\n\n\n“Yes,” Sarah replied, her voice small and distant in her own ears. “Have you seen him?”\n\n\n\nThe old man nodded slowly, as if recalling something from a long time ago. “Aye, I’ve seen many cats come and go. Had one of my own, years back. Named him Moxie. Smart as a whip, that one. But one day, he just up and vanished. Called for him, just like you’re doing now—‘Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?’” He repeated the call with a twisted grin that made Sarah’s skin crawl.\n\n\n\nHe continued, his voice taking on a sing-song quality, almost as if he were reciting a nursery rhyme. “I searched everywhere, high and low, through the streets and the woods. But the thing about cats is, they wander where we can’t follow. And sometimes, when they do come back, they’re not quite the same.”\n\n\n\nSarah felt a coldness settling over her as the man’s story drifted into something darker, something that felt ancient and deeply wrong. “Found him, in the woods, near the place where the trees grow so thick and dark they blot out the sky. But he wasn’t my Moxie anymore. Something else had found him first. Some say it’s an old witch, others say it’s something far older, something that lives in the shadows, something that feeds on the lost.”\n\n\n\nThe man’s voice trailed off, his eyes drifting to the darkness beyond the streetlights. Sarah felt Alex tremble beside her, and she gripped his hand tightly, finally finding the strength to pull him away. “Shame on you, sir,” she hissed, her voice trembling with fear and anger. She hurried away, the old man’s laughter following them, soft and unsettling, like the whisper of leaves in the wind.\n\n\n\nThat night, the house seemed to close in around them, the walls pressing in as if the very structure of the place was conspiring to trap them within. The wind had picked up, howling around the corners and rattling the windows like the breath of something hungry. Sarah lay in bed, her mind racing, thoughts of Chewy and the old man’s story tangling into an uneasy knot in her stomach.\n\n\n\nAnd then, just as she was beginning to drift off, she heard it—a faint sound, carried on the wind. “Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?” The call was distant, almost swallowed by the storm, but there was something off about it, something that twisted the words into something alien and mocking. Beneath it, she could hear a soft, cruel laughter, as though the wind itself was toying with her.\n\n\n\nShe bolted upright, her heart pounding in her chest. The house was silent again, the only sound the wind and rain against the windows. But the feeling lingered, a cold dread that seeped into her bones, refusing to let go. The night stretched on, every hour dragging into the next, until finally, the pale light of dawn began to filter through the curtains.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, Sarah made flyers of her own, her hands shaking as she taped them to the same posts she had seen the night before, each one a silent plea for the return of her beloved Chewy. But as she worked, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was too late, that Chewy was already lost to her, claimed by something she couldn’t name.\n\n\n\nThat afternoon, as she was going through another box, the phone rang. The voice on the other end was thin, almost a whisper. “I saw your cat,” it said, the words sliding into her ear like a cold blade.\n\n\n\nHer breath caught in her throat. “Where? Where did you see him?”\n\n\n\nThere was a pause, a breath of static, and then the line went dead.\n\n\n\nThat night, as the wind howled around the house once more, Sarah awoke to the sound of voices outside. “Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?” The call was louder this time, closer, and there were more voices now, all blending together in a twisted, mocking chorus that sent a chill through her soul.\n\n\n\nShe crept to the door, her heart pounding in her ears, and peered through the peephole. The night outside was thick with shadows, the wind howling like a living thing. And then the doorbell rang, sharp and sudden, making her jump. She opened the door slowly, her hands trembling, and there, on the stoop, was Chewy. Or what was left of him.\n\n\n\nHis body was twisted, broken, his fur matted with blood. His eyes, once bright and full of life, were dull, empty. Sarah’s breath caught in her throat, and she stumbled back, her hand flying to her mouth.\n\n\n\nBut as she backed away, a coldness seeped into the room, something darker than the night pressing in on her from behind. Slowly, she turned, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. There, in the shadows, was a shape—a twisted, barely human figure, its eyes glowing with a sickly light, its mouth curled into a smile that dripped with malice.\n\n\n\nIt leaned in close, its breath icy against her ear, and whispered, in a voice that was hers and yet not hers, a voice that echoed with the weight of every lost call, every unanswered plea—\n\n\n\n“Cha-cha-chewy, woo-woo, where are you?”"},"668":{"title":"Is there a 'canonical' set of stories about the Slenderman?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f7aysb\/is_there_a_canonical_set_of_stories_about_the\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"IvankoKostiuk","selftext":"I've been going down a nostalgia trip lately and I remember reading a bunch of the Slenderman stories, but for the life of me cannot remember any specifics. \n\nIs there a set of stories that is considered foundational or canonical in how important they are?\n\nAbout all I can think of is the videogames and Marble Hornets."},"669":{"title":"When Dream Turns Nightmare","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f75s9j\/when_dream_turns_nightmare\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"[deleted]","selftext":"Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by the world of dreams. The idea that our minds create these vivid and unpredictable worlds while we sleep has always intrigued me. As I grew up and pursued a career in science, I knew that studying the mechanics of dreaming would be my life's work.\n\nThroughout my years of research, I've had a constant companion by my side - my loyal golden retriever, Buddy. He's been with me through the ups and downs of my research, always there to comfort me when experiments didn't go as planned. With his support, I've poured countless hours into building the machine of my dreams.\n\nThe machine is massive, taking up an entire room in my lab. It's covered in wires and blinking lights, like something out of a sci-fi movie. But it's more than just a cool-looking gadget - it's a portal into the world of dreams.\n\nAfter years of hard work, I finally did it. I created a machine that can read the information from a person's brain while they're dreaming and display it onto a monitor. It was incredible to see the images that people had dreamt up - from fantastical landscapes to bizarre creatures.\n\nBut, as with any invention, there were limitations. The images were twisted and sometimes it was difficult to see anything. And the machine could only reveal what the person was dreaming for a few fleeting seconds, before the image faded away like mist. Still, those brief moments were enough to give us a glimpse into the inner workings of the human mind.\n\nHowever, I decided to take it one step further. \nMy biggest mistake.\n\nAs I looked at Buddy, I couldn't help but wonder: what did animals dream about? It was then that I made the fateful decision to connect Buddy to the machine.\n\nI added a sleeping pill to his food and waited for him to fall asleep. I know this sounds like abuse, but I swear it's not what it sounds like. I would never subject Buddy or any other animal to any experiments that cause them physical pain or psychological harm. \n\nI'm not that kind of scientist.\n\nAfter he was unconscious, I gently connected Buddy to the wires of the machine. To be honest, I wasn't sure the machine would work with dogs. Needless to say, the brain of a human and a dog are quite different, but through my years of study, I've come to realize that the dreaming process is almost.. universal.\n\nAs the machine came to life, I sat in my chair and watched the monitor with excitement and anticipation, waiting for the dream to happen, which didn't take long\n\nThe screen flickered as the machine decoded the information coming from Buddy's brain, until it starts to gain shapes and colors.\n\nInitially I found it nice, the images were beautiful, with vibrant colors and intricate details. From the few details I was able to identify on the monitor, I discovered that Buddy was dreaming that he was running with other dogs at his side in the park where I usually take him.\n\nBut then something strange happened. Buddy's dream took an unexpected turn, and suddenly, the dog began growling at an image on the screen that was not very clear. When I looked closer, I saw that the image was of myself.\n\nThe events that followed on the monitor were so horrifying and hideous that will forever haunt me.\n\nBuddy's eyes glowing with hatred and rage what once was innocence and pure goodness. He hated me and all mankind with every fiber of his being.\n\nAs I watched in horror, I realized that I made a much bigger discovery, one that should have remained in the realm of the unknown.\n\nAs the screen faded to black, I knew I had unleashed something dangerous and sinister. And I knew deep down that after this experience, nothing would ever be the same.\n\nI was at a loss. \n\nI couldn't explain why this was happening, and I certainly couldn't understand why my own dog would hate me so deeply. Buddy had always been pampered and loved big puppy, so where was this hatred coming from?\n\nAs I left the lab, haunted by the memories of what I had seen, I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe dogs weren't man's best friend after all."},"670":{"title":"Grin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f7hlfc\/grin\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"No-Glass-3279","selftext":"Twelve-year-old Oliver was thrilled. Tonight was the first time his parents had trusted him to stay home alone. It was a small victory, a milestone that he had eagerly awaited. The house was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the old wood floors, and the faint hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen. His parents had left hours ago, reminding him that they’d be back before midnight and urging him to call if he needed anything. But Oliver felt confident, proud even, that he didn’t need anyone. \n\nCurled up on the living room couch with his favorite comic book, he let the stillness of the house envelop him. The clock ticked softly on the wall, and the familiar scent of his mom’s lavender air freshener lingered in the air. Everything was normal, just as it always was. \n\nBut then, a sound—a soft, rhythmic thumping—broke the silence. Oliver glanced up, confused. The old family cat, Midnight, must have been wandering the house. But Midnight was a slow, lazy cat, never one to make much noise. \n\nThe thumping grew louder, more insistent, accompanied by a strange scraping sound. Oliver frowned, setting down his comic book. He listened carefully, trying to determine where the noise was coming from. It seemed to be coming from his parents’ room. \n\n“Midnight?” Oliver called out. But there was no sweet meow in response, just more thumping and now, what sounded like a low growl. Midnight never growled. A chill ran down Oliver’s spine. Maybe Midnight had caught a mouse or something. \n\nHe stood up, the hardwood floor cold beneath his feet, and made his way toward the hallway. The thumping had stopped, but the uneasy feeling it left behind hadn’t. The hallway was darker than usual, the lightbulb flickering weakly above him. He paused at the door to his parents’ room, his hand hovering over the doorknob. For a moment, he considered turning back, but curiosity—or perhaps something darker—pushed him forward. \n\nHe opened the door slowly, the hinges creaking loudly in the oppressive silence. The room was dim, the only light coming from the half-moon outside, casting eerie shadows across the floor. The first thing he noticed was the shattered window, the cool night air blowing in, rustling the curtains. Then his eyes fell on the floor. \n\nA tangled mess of dark, matted fur lay in a pool of blood near the window. His breath caught in his throat, and he took a hesitant step closer. The fur was unmistakably Midnight’s, but what was left of her was unrecognizable. Her body was torn apart, limbs twisted at unnatural angles, the once sleek, black coat now a crimson mess. \n\nOliver felt sick. His mind raced, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. He stumbled back, his foot catching on something soft. He looked down and saw another clump of fur, this one soaked in blood. Panic set in, his heart pounding in his chest. He needed to get out, to call his parents, to do anything but stand there in horror. \n\nBut something drew his attention to the window, the broken glass glittering ominously in the moonlight. He couldn’t stop himself from moving closer, his breath coming in short, terrified gasps. \n\nHe peered out the window, expecting to see the familiar backyard, the old oak tree swaying gently in the breeze. Instead, he was met with a sight that made his blood run cold. \n\nA face stared back at him, hovering just beyond the broken glass. The skin was ashen, stretched tight over sharp cheekbones. The mouth was pulled into an impossibly wide grin, teeth too many, too sharp, gleaming in the darkness. But it was the eyes—dark, empty pits that bore into his soul—that rooted him to the spot, paralyzing him with fear. \n\nBefore he could scream, before he could even think to run, long, spindly fingers shot through the window, wrapping around his wrist with an iron grip. The smile widened, splitting the face further, and with a sickening yank, pulled Oliver through the broken window. \n\nThe world spun, the night air rushing past him as he was dragged into the darkness, the broken glass slicing through his skin. He didn’t even have time to cry out as the ground disappeared beneath him, leaving only the echo of his terrified screams in the still night. \n\nWhen his parents returned home later that night, they found the house eerily quiet. The lights were off, the door unlocked. No loud television or snacks and soda cans on the coffee table. They searched the house frantically, calling his name, but there was no answer, no sign of their son. \n\nIt wasn’t until they stepped into the bedroom that they saw it—chaos; a pool of blood soaking into the hardwood floor. Their eyes followed the blood trail up the wall to the broken window, and Oliver’s mother collapsed. \n\nCaught on the jagged edge of the broken window, was a small, shredded forearm-the hand still clinging to a piece of glass. \n\n "},"671":{"title":"The Rewritten - New Project","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f7lj5f\/the_rewritten_new_project\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Federal-Guest5151","selftext":"Hey, guys!\n\nI'm Mailman, I do YouTube, and I write for games.

It's funny, I’ve no memory of that day being a happy celebration. All I remember is the fear I felt sitting on my bed as I covered my ears trying to drown out the shouting that filled our bedroom and the face of the monster that entered our bedroom that night. \n\nMy sister was in the bed next to mine. She was screaming as if she was being attacked. My dad must have heard her and came into the room to protect us. I didn’t see it at first. I was probably too scared to open my eyes, but when I did, it was just standing there looking right at me, with its black soulless eyes and a gaunt and pale expressionless face.\n\nI remembered my dad lunging at the monster before he fell to the floor bleeding. The next thing I remember is my mom coming into the room screaming, and when I looked, the monster was gone. \n\nYou see, monsters aren’t meant to exist, and for years, no one believed me, but I know what I saw. The police said it was probably a Junkie trying to rob us, but they could never explain how it got into the house. There was no sign of a break-in and the house was still locked up tight. \n\nAfter that night nothing was the same for us. My mom decided to check. She was there in body, but it was like the lights were on, but no one was home. I resented her deeply for it. We needed her more than anyone. Instead, we lived with the sense that we had lost two parents. \n\nMy love affair with drugs started with my mother. Her self-medicating came in the form of blue and purple pills she called mommy's little helpers, which only helped to turn her into something we didn’t recognize. It was harder on my sister who was too young to realize what was happening. She didn’t understand why her mommy’s voice changed when she was so out of it. She didn’t understand why her mom couldn’t get out of bed most days to make sure she had something to eat before school. She didn’t understand why mommy would nod off during a parent-teacher meeting, which resulted in us getting taken into care. \n\nEventually, she got her act together long enough to get us back. There was a brief moment when I saw the person we called Mom, but it was short-lived. It didn’t take long before the pills took over again. I was 15 the last time I saw my mother alive before she was dragged off to a mental institution. \n\nI had learned from the best, and it started with me sneaking my mother's pills when she was too wasted to notice. It didn’t take long for me to move on to heroin, which has been a part of my life now for 15 years. \n\nMy sister didn’t stand a chance having a mother and a brother for Junkies. Being younger she must have felt more alone than I did, so I understood the place she was in. The last time I saw my sister, she had run away from the care home she was staying in, and I gave her money so she could disappear. \n\nIt was a few years before I heard from her again. She had phoned me in hysterics telling me it was her fault that our dad was murdered. She begged me to come see her because she didn’t want to explain it over the phone. \n\nThe address she gave me was a run-down, rat-infested squat. I had to climb through a window in the back of the building to get in. If hell was a place this was it. Misery and desperation seeped from the walls. A smell of puke and stale sweat permeated the air, as I searched around for my sister. I came to a door at the end of the hall which was closed. When I opened it, I was hit with the smell of death. \n\n My sister's body was already cold, and she still had the needle in her arm. I was too numb to cry, but inside I was screaming. Next to her body was a note with my name on it with the words “it wasn’t your fault,” written on it. \n\nAfter they took her body away I decided to stay a few days in the squat since I had no place of my own. My sister had pictures of us during better times stuck to the wall where I found her. I could still feel her presence and didn’t want to leave her in this cold dark place alone. \n\nThe room had a closet which was the only bit of furniture in the place. I decided to check it to see if my sister had any more drugs hidden away, but it was empty apart from a tunnel. \n\nThe tunnel had me perplexed. It seemed dark and endless, but on the other side of the wall was an empty room. I climbed in and began making my way down the long and dark passage. It seemed to go on forever, but eventually, a light appeared at the end. When I made it to the other end I found myself in another closet.\n\n As I slowly crept from the closet I was hit with a familiar smell, something warm that I remembered from my childhood. I had been in this room before. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes as childhood memories came flooding back. It was my old bedroom, the one I shared with my sister all those years ago.\n\nI quietly explored the rest of the house. I went downstairs, and there was my dad's favourite chair in the corner, and next to it was the morning paper he would read before he left for work. My eyes widened and my heart began to race when I noticed the date on the paper. It was the day of my tenth birthday and a few hours before my dad was murdered. \n\nI found myself back in the rundown squat. I struggled to make sense of what I just discovered, but maybe this was what my sister wanted to talk to me about. Maybe this was a chance to go back and change our lives for the better. This was a chance to go back and kill the monster before he killed my dad. \n\nI waited until the sunset before heading back down the tunnel armed with a gun. My heart was pounding as sweat poured from every pore. Even with the heroine in my system, the mixture of fear and anticipation was overwhelming. I kept going until the light at the end of the tunnel appeared. I stayed hidden behind the closet doors and didn’t jump out until I heard my dad shouting. \n\nI expected to see him struggling with a monster, but when I jumped out of the closet, the monster I found was my dad. He was beating my sister relentlessly as the younger me sat on the other bed covering his ears. For a brief moment, I locked eyes with my younger self. I could feel the fear that radiated from his eyes as my sister screamed for him to stop. \n\nMy dad’s face was a mix of fear and confusion as I screamed at him to stop. He lunged at me from across the room, and without thinking, I shot him, and he fell to the floor. I could hear my mom screaming as I jumped back into the closet and down through the tunnel. \n\nWhen I made it back to the squat, my mind was racing, trying to comprehend what had just happened. It was then I realized what the note my sister left meant. \n\n“It's not your fault,”\n\n"},"674":{"title":"Ambition - They Don't Know They're Born","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f74tqd\/ambition_they_dont_know_theyre_born\/","flair":"Video","author":"CaptainKando","selftext":"The next episode of the Season 1.5 side stories focusses on Dr. Hamilton from \"The Last Will\".

I collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, the image of Clara's tormented face burned into my mind. The forest around me was silent, eerily so, as if the world itself was holding its breath.\n\nI thought I was safe, that I had escaped. But then I felt it—a coldness, not just in the air, but deep within me. It spread from my chest, icy tendrils creeping through my veins. I looked down at my wrist, where the shadow had grabbed me, and my blood ran cold. A dark mark, like a bruise but far deeper, pulsed beneath my skin, spreading slowly, as if something was taking root inside me.\n\nI scrambled to my feet, panic rising as I tried to rub it away, but it was no use. The mark was growing, the darkness within it alive, spreading up my arm, tightening its grip with every passing second.\n\nIn the distance, the cabin loomed, barely visible through the trees, but I could still feel its presence, its eyes on me, watching, waiting.\n\nSuddenly, a voice whispered in my ear, soft and cold, like a breath of winter air. \"\\*You can't run from it, Tommy...\\*\" The voice was Clara's, but twisted, darker, as if something else was speaking through her. \"\\*It’s inside you now.\\*\"\n\nI stumbled backward, eyes wide with terror, but the whispering continued, growing louder, more insistent. I could hear them—dozens of voices, all around me, rising from the shadows, each one echoing Clara’s words.\n\nI ran, not toward safety, but away from it, deeper into the woods, driven by a primal fear that I couldn’t shake. The trees closed in around me, the darkness thickening with every step I took, until I could no longer tell where the forest ended and the shadows began.\n\nFinally, I tripped, falling hard onto the cold, damp ground. The whispers had stopped, but the silence that followed was worse—oppressive, suffocating. I could feel the darkness inside me, gnawing at my soul, consuming everything I was.\n\nAs I lay there, paralyzed with fear, I felt a presence beside me. I turned my head, and there she was—Clara, standing in the shadows, her face a mask of sorrow and something else... something triumphant.\n\n\"Welcome home, Tommy,\" she whispered, her voice no longer pleading but commanding. Her eyes, those empty voids, locked onto mine, and I knew that whatever Clara had become, I was now a part of it.\n\nI tried to scream, to run, but the darkness inside me surged, swallowing my thoughts, my will, everything that made me who I was. And then there was only silence, as the shadows closed in, the forest vanishing around me.\n\nWhen the searchers found the cabin days later, they found it empty—just another abandoned ruin lost to time. But if you listen closely, on certain nights when the moon is dark, you can still hear the whispers in the woods, calling out, searching for someone new to join them.\n\nAnd deep within the shadows, where the light never reaches, two figures stand side by side—eyes hollow, faces twisted in a perpetual, sorrowful smile—waiting."},"679":{"title":"Can I post stories here?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f703ie\/can_i_post_stories_here\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"The_Real_Nyooom","selftext":"Hi all!

The once-vibrant community had grown quiet, its people wary of the darkness that seemed to linger longer than it should. The older folks spoke in hushed tones about the shadows that moved on their own, while the younger ones tried to laugh it off, though they too felt the creeping dread.\n\nSarah Meyers had tried to forget what happened. The guilt of not being able to save her friend gnawed at her, but she buried it deep, focusing on finishing high school and getting out of Greystone for good. But no matter how hard she tried, the memory of that night stayed with her, the sight of Jenny’s empty bed, the broken lamp, and the cold, oppressive air that filled the room.\n\nNow a college student, Sarah returned to Greystone only when she had to. This summer, however, she was back for a longer stay, helping her parents pack up their house to move to the city. They had finally decided to leave, unable to shake the sense of unease that had gripped the town since Jenny's disappearance.\n\nIt was on one of those nights, while sorting through boxes in the attic, that Sarah found something that made her blood run cold. Hidden among old photos and forgotten trinkets was a small, leather-bound journal. It was Jenny's.\n\nSarah hadn’t known Jenny kept a journal. Her hands trembled as she opened it, the musty pages filled with Jenny’s neat handwriting. The entries started innocuously enough, notes about school, friends and boys she liked but soon took a darker turn. Jenny had been seeing the shadows long before that fateful night. She wrote about feeling watched, about the Hat Man, about how the shadows would creep closer and closer each night.\n\nAnd then, the final entry: “They’re coming for me tonight. I can feel it. I’m so scared, but maybe… maybe if they take me, they’ll leave everyone else alone.”\n\nSarah slammed the journal shut, her heart pounding. She felt the same oppressive cold that had filled Jenny’s room that night. The shadows in the attic seemed to stretch and twist, as if they were alive. She backed away, nearly stumbling down the stairs.\n\nThat night, sleep eluded her. Every creak of the house, every rustle of the wind outside made her jump. She could feel the eyes of the shadows watching her from the corners of the room. The Hat Man was out there, she knew it and he hadn’t forgotten her.\n\nThe next day, Sarah went to the only person in Greystone who might know what to do, Old Man Hutchins. He was a recluse who lived on the outskirts of town, rumored to be a former priest or occultist, depending on who you asked. The townsfolk avoided him, saying he was crazy, but Sarah had no other choice.\n\nHutchins answered the door with a wary look, but when he saw the journal in Sarah’s hands, his eyes widened in recognition. Without a word, he led her inside.\n\n“I warned them,” he said in a raspy voice, once they were seated in his cluttered living room. “Warned the town about the shadows. The Hat Man… he’s an ancient thing, older than this town. He feeds on fear, on souls. Jenny…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “She wasn’t the first, and she won’t be the last.”\n\nSarah felt a chill at his words. “Then how do we stop him?”\n\nHutchins gave her a sad smile. “You don’t. The Hat Man can’t be killed or banished, not permanently. But you can drive him away for a time, if you’re strong enough.”\n\nHe explained the ritual, a mix of old Christian rites and even older pagan practices. It involved candles, symbols drawn in salt, and a recitation in a language Sarah didn’t recognize. It sounded insane, but she was desperate.\n\nThat night, as darkness fell over Greystone, Sarah prepared for the ritual in her parents’ basement. She followed Hutchins’ instructions to the letter, drawing the symbols on the floor, lighting the candles, and reciting the incantation with all the conviction she could muster.\n\nThe shadows in the basement seemed to thicken as she spoke, coalescing into darker forms. And then, she felt him, the Hat Man. He stood at the edge of the light, his tall, thin figure framed by the darkness. His face was still obscured, but she could feel his gaze, cold and malevolent.\n\nThe shadows surged toward her, but the symbols on the floor flared to life, holding them back. The Hat Man didn’t move, just watched as Sarah continued the ritual, her voice growing stronger as she repeated the incantation. The shadows writhed and twisted, but they couldn’t cross the boundary of light and salt.\n\nThen, with a final shout, Sarah completed the ritual. The air grew still, and the shadows recoiled, retreating into the corners of the room. The Hat Man’s form seemed to waver, and for the briefest moment, she thought she saw a face beneath the hat, smokey, gaunt, and filled with an ancient hunger.\n\nAnd then he was gone, the shadows dispersing as if they had never been there.\n\nSarah collapsed to the floor, shaking with relief. It was over, at least for now. But she knew, deep down, that the Hat Man would return one day. He always did. But she wouldn’t be caught off guard again. She would be ready.\n\nAs she sat in the darkened basement, she felt herself rocking in a circular motion. Dazed, she snapped out of her trance and realised something... The Hat Man had left something behind, a message, a warning. While she glanced at the symbols on the floor, she felt it, a shadowy figure standing just outside the circle of light, watching her with unseen eyes.\n\nSarah looked at the symbols she had drawn in her trance, they seemed to shift and rearrange themselves, forming words in a language she couldn't fully comprehend. But as she stared at the markings, their meaning became clear, seeping into her mind like a dark whisper.\n\nThe message read:\n\n\"You can’t hide forever. I will return for what was taken. You belong to the shadows now, you belong to me now\"\n\nThe words seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the letters flickering as if made from the very darkness they warned against. The salt line, once a barrier, now looked fragile, as though the Hat Man’s influence had begun to corrode it.\n\nSarah felt a cold dread settle into her bones, understanding that this was not just a threat, it was a promise. The Hat Man had been driven back, but he was far from defeated. And next time, he would come for her."},"685":{"title":"Help needed ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f6vco2\/help_needed\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"night_owl107","selftext":"Hi all , I want to translate Ted the caver.

It was an ordinary day until the sun set and she never came home. The search efforts were intense but fruitless, and the grief tore our family apart. But deep down, I always knew she hadn’t really left. Every night at 3:33 AM, Clara returns.\n\nShe stands motionless beside my bed, her eyes dark and empty, staring intently at me. She whispers something, her voice faint and distant, but I can always make out one phrase: \"\\*Tommy, help me...\\*\" But this isn’t the Clara I knew. Her face is pale, marked by an unnatural stillness, as if something ancient and malevolent has taken hold of her.\n\nI know I need to fin out what happened to her, to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. The more she visits, the more the shadows in my room seem to grow, as if they’re alive. I can’t escape the feeling that I’m being watched by something sinister, something that wants more than just to haunt me.\n\nI stared at the photograph Clara had left on my bed. It was impossible—she looked exactly the same as the day she disappeared, not a day older. But the background in the picture was unfamiliar. It wasn’t taken in our town or anywhere I recognized. The shadows in the photo were unnaturally long, stretching out like dark fingers reaching for her.\n\nI knew I had to find the location in the photo. I scanned every detail, hoping for a clue. There was a tree, twisted and gnarled, standing alone against a dim, cloudy sky. Behind it, a small, dilapidated cabin, its windows shattered. Something about the place sent a shiver down my spine. It felt... wrong, like it didn’t belong in this world.\n\nThat night, I dreamt of the cabin. In my dream, I was standing in front of it, the same eerie shadows surrounding me. I could hear Clara’s voice, faint and distant, calling my name, begging me to help her. The door of the cabin creaked open slowly, revealing nothing but darkness inside. As I stepped closer, something cold and slimy brushed against my arm, and I jolted awake, drenched in sweat.\n\nThe next day, I decided to search for the cabin. I spent hours driving through back roads and old trails, asking anyone I could about the place in the photo. Most people had never seen anything like it, but a few older locals mentioned an abandoned cabin deep in the woods, far from any path. They warned me not to go, telling me stories about people who ventured there and were never the same again. \n\nIgnoring their warnings, I set out that afternoon. The deeper I went into the woods, the more oppressive the atmosphere became. The trees seemed to close in around me, blocking out the sunlight. Finally, I found it—the cabin from the photo. It looked exactly the same, as if it hadn’t aged a day, just like Clara.\n\nMy heart pounded as I approached the door. The air was thick with a strange, metallic smell, and the shadows around the cabin seemed to move on their own. I hesitated, remembering the warnings, but Clara’s voice echoed in my mind. I had to know the truth.\n\n\n\n"},"687":{"title":"Rough draft for \"The Cure\".","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f6prwh\/rough_draft_for_the_cure\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"anondroid1","selftext":"The world has gone mad, but for you, it's just another day. As the pandemic hits, it seems like everyone is losing their minds—stockpiling toilet paper, freaking out over lockdowns, and obsessing over the latest death tolls. But not you. You're used to working from home, alone, with no one to bother you. The isolation doesn’t feel any different from your usual routine.\n\nOf course, the conspiracy theorists crawl out of the woodwork, as they always do when something big happens. You've seen their posts all over the internet—wild claims about how the virus is engineered by the government, about how it's all part of some sinister plan to control the population. You laugh and scroll past, shaking your head at their paranoia. Let them believe what they want. It’s not your problem.\n\nThe deaths keep climbing, and the news is relentless—grim updates, day after day, each worse than the last. But then, finally, some good news: a vaccine. Not just any vaccine, but a cure, they say. It will alter your DNA, make you immune to the virus for life. The conspiracy nuts are back at it again, screaming from their corners of the internet that it’s dangerous, that it will do more harm than good. “Don’t take it!” they warn. “It’s all part of the plan!” You ignore them, as usual. The last thing you need is to get sick because you listened to a bunch of lunatics.\n\nSo, you get the shot. It’s simple, quick, and barely hurts at all. The nurse tells you to expect some flu-like symptoms, maybe a bit of fatigue, but nothing serious. You thank her, go home, and take some aspirin just in case. Then you crawl into bed, ready to sleep off whatever is coming.\n\nWhen you wake up, it feels like you’ve been hit by a truck. Your head pounds, your body aches, and your throat is on fire. You try to shake it off—just the vaccine doing its job, you tell yourself. It will pass. You drag yourself to your phone, scrolling through the news to distract yourself from the pain. The world seems even more chaotic than before—cities burning, riots breaking out, stories of parents losing their minds and harming their own children. And the conspiracy theorists? They’re ranting about body snatchers now, claiming the vaccine is some kind of trap. You roll your eyes and toss the phone aside. It’s all too much.\n\nThe days blur together in a haze of fever and pain. You lose track of time, drifting in and out of sleep, downing over-the-counter meds like candy, trying to drown out the madness with endless scrolling. Eventually, the fever breaks. You wake up, weak but relieved to feel something like normal again. Just a persistent sniffle and a mild cough—nothing to worry about. You’re over the worst of it.\n\nNow that you're over it, your stomach reminds you that you haven't eaten much lately. You haven’t gone to the store either, and supplies are low. You resolve to make use of your new VaxPass that allows you to go out in public again. Lol, those anti-vax suckers still aren’t allowed out. \"Serves 'em right,\" you mutter to yourself, still ruminating on it in the cereal aisle at the local market. You're surprised to see so many people out already. They all silently shuffle along the aisles, staring ahead. \"They look like worker drones,\" your mind smirks as you notice their peculiar behavior. They're probably still recovering from the virus, and you shouldn’t judge. After all, they have the pass just like you; they aren’t the problem.\n\nAs you get back to your routine, the cough grows worse. It’s not just a tickle anymore; it’s like something is stuck deep in your chest, something thick and slimy that won’t come up no matter how hard you cough. The more you try to clear it, the worse it gets. Suddenly, your chest heaves, and a deep, gut-wrenching coughing fit almost floors you. Your throat burns like you’ve swallowed bleach. You can feel a thick mucus lodged in your throat that seems to be emitting a chemical burn. \"WTF is happening?\" you think.\n\nPanic starts to creep in. You try everything—gargling with saltwater, drinking scalding hot coffee, even shoving your fingers down your throat, trying to dislodge whatever is choking you. But nothing works. The pain intensifies, the feeling of something alive inside you growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nAnd then, finally, you feel it. Something shifts in your throat, a slimy mass moving up, inch by inch. Gagging, you stumble to the bathroom mirror, forcing yourself to look. There, just behind your tonsils, you see it—a sickly, translucent mass, glistening wetly in the dim light. Your hands shake as you reach into your mouth, fingers closing around the slick, slimy thing. It’s warm, pulsating slightly as if it has a life of its own.\n\nYou pull. The thing stretches, a thick rope of mucus and something else, something wrong. It slides up from deep inside you, scraping against your throat, making you gag and retch as you yank it out. The sensation is horrific, like you’re pulling yourself inside out, your insides unraveling with each tug. The rope keeps coming, longer and longer, like one of those magician’s handkerchiefs that never end.\n\nYou pull harder, desperation clawing at your mind as the pain becomes unbearable. And then, with one final, agonizing yank, you feel something tear inside you. There’s a sickening pop, and the world goes black.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, you’re not standing anymore. You’re lying on the cold bathroom floor, staring up at your own face. But something is wrong. Your perspective is all wrong. You can’t move, can’t feel anything except the cold, hard tile beneath you. You try to scream, but nothing happens. You can only watch as your body—no, the thing inside your body—stands over you, calmly picking up a mop.\n\nThe last thing you see before the darkness swallows you whole is the cold, dead eyes of the creature wearing your face. And then, finally, mercifully, nothing at all."},"688":{"title":"Ages on the creepypasta reddit.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f645kt\/ages_on_the_creepypasta_reddit\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Critical_Shame_7572","selftext":"As I want to write a creepypasta, i kinda wonder.

misticismos de nosso líder louco que nos temos que ficar indo para lugares aleatórios, para procurar itens que ninguém sabe se existem ou não como a arca da aliança por exemplo.\n\nOtto: você não acha injusto nos homens humildes e de bom coração estarmos aqui apenas cavando e cavando e nos sujando com areia enquanto aquele oficial velho e nojento tem acesso a sombra e água fresca enquanto fica fumando um belo charuto e apenas exibindo aquele bigode horrorosa e achando que está atraindo olhares principalmente os olhares femininos e olha que não tem nenhuma mulher por aqui.\n\nO irmão mais novo de Otto, \"Friedrich Von den Blumen\" respondeu a seu irmão mais velho;\n\nFriedrich: Otto e melhor não questionar muito as ordens de nosso líder e de seus soldados, sabe Otto não quero terminar em um campo de concentração, e não quero que você pare lá também então cale a boca!\n\nOtto Apenas revira os olhos meio frustrado com seu irmão, o achando muito submisso, Otto pensava sempre muito preocupado em sua esposa uma mulher judia e da situação dela na Alemanha, Otto só queria voltar para a sua família e se livrar daqueles malditos soldados que os observavam por 24 horas a fio.\n\nDepois de horas e mais horas de escavação eles abriram um buraco profundo.\n\nE finalmente encontrarem uma tumba de ouro, e quando a tumba foi encontra o imenso cristal vermelho atrás do general começou a brilhar intensamente e fazer um intenso barulho que lembrava um grande sino de uma igreja, o som e a luz indicavam que aquele sarcofago tinha uma energia especial!\n\nO oficial Walther sorriu pois sabia com aquele achado que ele conseguir uma grande posição dentro do partido.\n\nEle mandou 4 homens usarem seus pinceis de escavação para retirarem toda a areia de cima do sarcofago os 8 homens mais fortes daquele imenso grupo carregarem o sarcofago, mesmo com esses homem os negocio estava ainda muito pesado, e eles demoraram 50 minutos para subir a rampa que levava a saída do buraco.\n\nE demoraram mais 25 minutos para acorrentar a tumba em cima do Panzer, Walther estava sorrindo e mandou colocar o grande cristal em cima de um grande carro de combate.\n\nOs alemães ouvirem uma forte explosão, um soldado estava sem uma perna coberto de sangue e com vários fragmentos de granada em sua pele ele chorava e gritava para todos evacuarem essa área.\n\nWalter percebeu que eram tropas ingleses e estadonidenses, e mandou todo mundo evacuar, o oficial entrou no tanque de guerra.\n\nOtto e Friedrich conseguiram entrar carros blindados, e apenas 30 dos escavadores conseguiriam entrar nos carros de combate abandonando 60 escavadores junto com os soldados que lutaram contra os soldados aliados.\n\nOtto ficou muito triste ao ver seus companheiros escavadores morrendo, mesmo Friedrich vendo isso ele apenas estava com a cara virada fingindo inconformidade mesmo que esteja sofrendo por dentro pelos seus colegas.\n\nEles ficaram fugindo por horas.\n\nAté que a noite bateu eles finalmente pararam, eles estavam perto da fronteira com o Sudão, as margens do rio nilo, eles decidiram montar o acampamento ali mesmo.\n\nOtto sentia muito frio, então montou sua tenda o mais rápido possível e finalmente a montando ele entrou nela e pegou sua mochila, a abrindo ele foi logo pegar uma pequena garrafa cheia de cerveja quente, ele bebeu mesmo com ele fazendo uma expressão de nojo e não tendo gostado ele não queria fazer desperdício e continuou bebendo.\n\nQuando ele ouviu Friedrich fazendo com a boca o barulho toc toc e viu o seu punho fechado penetrando levemente o tecido da barraca, e Otto deixou Friedrich entrar o mesmo quando entrou se sentou ao lado de seu irmão notando seu olhar afastado e melancólico e disse:\n\nFriedrich: Por que está tão está tão triste? meu irmão.\n\nOtto soluçando diz:\n\nOtto: Sabe meu irmão, eu tenho saudade, saudade da minha família da minhas esposa e filhos eu só quero poder voltar para a Alemanha só quero voltar para casa para minha esposa e filhos eu nunca quis ir para África só porque o partido quer ficar brincando de caça ao tesouro.\n\nFriedrich: Isso é importante, a Alemanha precisa vencer a guerra, por isso estamos aqui, a paz ira reinar e nós vamos poder voltar para casa, nada mais de areia e nem de merda de dromedário e para isso acontecer nos vamos ter que cooperar com o partido.\n\nOtto: Eu não quero cooperar com esse partido de merda, um maldito e podre governo que manda jovens para morrer em campo de combate, um partido autoritário, um partido que persegue minha esposa,filhos e semelhantes.\n\nFriedrich estava nervoso e disse para seu irmão mais velho:\n\nFriedrich: a vadia judia enfiou muita merda na sua cabeça apenas sossegue o faixo cala a merda da boca que se não denuncio você para o oficial e você vai acabar num lugar que não quer ir.\n\nOtto: Chama minha esposa de vadia mais uma vez para não vê se não te quebro os dentes e lhe arranco a língua.\n\nFriedrich disferi um tapa contra Otto e o mesmo revida colocando as duas mãos no pescoço de seu irmão, e os dois rolam dentro da barraca um ameaçando o outro com ameaças de morte e xingamentos.\n\nQuando Otto quebra uma garrafa de cerveja que ele tinha dentro da barraca no rosto de seu irmão que faz um grande corte em seu rosto.\n\nFriedrich sai da barraca falando que vai afogar seu irmão nas águas do nilo e enterrar para ser esquecido no meio das areias do Saara.\n\nE Friedrich sai resmungando voltando direto para sua barraca.\n\nEnquanto isso Otto apenas deita e fica olhando para o teto da barraca reelembrando de quando Friedrich não era tão louco,fanático e violento, lembranças que ao mesmo tempo alegram o coração de Otto mas ao mesmo tempo machucam muito, ele chorou um pouco antes de adormecer totalmente.\n\nEnquanto Friedrich se sentindo nervoso e contrariado estava planejando uma possível vingança contra seu irmão e dormiu na angustia e na raiva.\n\n\n\nEnquanto isso Walther estava olhando para o sarcofago e mandou os soldados abrirem a tumba, o forte cheiro inundou rapidamente a barraca, e no sarcofago tinha algo estranho que parecia mas ao mesmo tempo não parecia ser um ser humano deixando Walther e os soldados abismados mas ao mesmo tempo impressionados e alegres com a descoberta.\n\nO oficial apertou a mão dos seus soldados, e eles saíram da barraca e foram dormir em suas barracas respectivas, quando o estranho ser ficou sozinho ele fez algo extraordinário.\n\nDe seu peito saíram 6 tentáculos que possuíam uma textura que lembrava madeira, os tentáculos aos poucos se esticavam até chegarem no solo e se aprofundarem nele, a expressão da criatura que antes emanava morte agora emana alegria e vontade.\n\nNo dia seguinte.\n\nOtto teve um pesadelo com uma estranha criatura e acordou, era já de manhã , o sol batia na tenda do escavador provocando intenso calor e deixando o ambiente abafado, Otto saiu imediatamente, o sol batia fortemente em seus olhos o mesmo bloqueou com a palma da mão.\n\nEle ainda despertando, despertou de vez quando ouviu um alto grito de susto.\n\nEle percebeu uma multidão envolta da dispensa improvisada que eles fizeram, e quando Otto se aproximou ele também ficou impressionado e viu que os pães haviam virando pedra, e que toda a água havia se tornado sangue, estava todo mundo muito impressionando e assustado, inclusive Friedrich que estava de queixo caído olhando para os pães petrificados.\n\nOtto mesmo focado no estranho evento, ele viu isso como uma oportunidade para pedir perdão para seu irmão, ele o chegou por trás de seu irmão tocando em seu ombro esquerdo.\n\nNum rápido e agressivo movimento Friedrich se virou e pegou no braço de seu irmão e o olhou com um olhar furioso e falou:\n\nFriedrich: você é um idiota mesmo acha que vou te perdoar por me deixado com essa merda de cicatriz, você acha que sou idiota? me diz!\n\nOtto: não, não irmão você eu não quis dizer, isso só acho que você devia deixar esse ódio todo de lado, isso tá destruindo você isso tá me destruindo emocionalmente.\n\nFriedrich Você acha que não tenho motivos para ficar com raiva? você me deixou com a merda de uma cicatriz gigante em meu rosto.\n\nOtto: então tá, eu não tenho ódio por você, nem que quando o partido estava recrutando pessoas para encontrar um item misterioso no meio do deserto e você teve a uma ideia de bosta de alistar eu e você nisso, você nem perguntou se eu queria ficar longe de minha família que corre risco lá na Alemanha sem esta lá para os proteger, não eu não queria não queria mesmo, e nem por isso estou com ódio de você.\n\nFriedrich se viu sem saída e mandou um seguinte comentário:\n\nFriedrich: sabia que eu sempre fui o preferido da mamãe?\n\nFriedrich largou o braço de Otto e saiu furioso pisando forte nas areias do deserto, um dos escavadores um homem chamado Wolfgang Klein fez um comentário dizendo:\n\nWolfgang Klein: você tem 33 anos né Otto? e se irmão tem 29 anos né? mas vocês agem como se tivesse 12 e 8 anos.\n\nOtto notou Wolfgang rindo muito e apenas o mandou fechar o bico.\n\nWolfgang deu de ombros e acendeu seu cigarro, e o mesmo até ofereceu um para Otto que recusou por não serem de sua marca favorita.\n\nFriedrich andava pelo acampamento e estranhava não estar encontrando o oficial Walther, ele sabia onde ficava a imensa barraca dele, Friedrich mesmo sabendo que oficial tratava de assuntos do partido e do exercito alemão, ele não gosta que espiem.\n\nMas Friedrich estava muito preocupado com o oficial e abriu sua barraca e o que ele viu o deixou abismado.\n\nOs olhos antes verde claros de Walther agora estavam totalmente negros, ele chorava sangue e ele estavam com a boca bastante aberta e de sua boca saiam grossas raives e um pouco de sangue, Friedrich mesmo assustado ele encontrou no corpo de Walther o corpo estava bastante frio.\n\nE do nada 6 tentáculos começaram a sair da barriga de Walther e eles tocando no chão funcionaram como se fossem pernas para ele que ria de uma forma distorcida e que ecoava por todo o ambiente, ele corria atrás de Friedrich que assustado não sabia o que fazer e correu sem querer derrubando e bagunçando outras barracas, ele tentava proucurar algo para se defender, encontrou um cantil de aço e usou ele para dar um forte murro no rosto da criatura que antes era Walther.\n\nA criatura apenas vomitou um liquido amarelo junto com algumas larvas, mas ainda continuou a perseguir Friedrich, mas o mesmo chegou perto do grande cristal vermelho a estranha criatura fez uma cara bizarra como se tivesse sentindo muita exitação sexual diante do cristal vermelho que brilhava.\n\nMas Friedrich encostou no cristal e a criatura tomou um intenso choque, energia vermelha saiu de seu corpo e a criatura morreu.\n\nFriedrich gritava encolhido em posição fetal e ao mesmo tempo apontando pro corpo gritando que aquilo era um demônio.\n\nO resto dos soldados e escavadores olhavam achando que ele era louco e que ele tinha matado o oficial pos o corpo dele apareceu morto sem alterações diante o olhar de todos os outros ali.\n\nMas Wolfgang e Otto viam as mesmas coisas que Friedrich.\n\nWolfgang decidiu se aproximar do sarcofago e viu a estranha criatura que estava lá sorrindo e notou que lá havia crescido varias plantinhas, Wolfgang tinha uma pistola escondida embaixo de sua roupa e tentou atirar contra a criatura mas algo inesperado aconteceu.\n\nA arma explodiu na mão esquerda de Wolfgang a queimando e o fazendo gritar de dor e agonia todos viram o evento.\n\nOtto pegou Wolfgang nos braços para o levar para a enfermaria, outros três soldados também sacaram suas armas e tentaram atirar contra a criatura, mas o tiro saiu pela culatra para ambos os três.\n\nMas 4 escavadores misteriosamente foram até o vomito da criatura e começaram a comer as larvas junto com a areia do deserto, eles estavam tão felizes comendo as larvas, mas seus olhos estavam negros, depois que eles terminaram, varias vespas saíram da boca dos 4 homens que logo em seguida morreram, as vespas atacavam todos ali no acampamento mas depois de 5 minutos todas as vespas morreram, estavam todos cheios de picadas.\n\nOtto reclamou chorando muito, com uma expressão e tom de voz que misturava bastante tristeza e bastante raiva:\n\nOtto: Que merda está acontecendo? eu queria ser apenas um simplório homem vivendo em Hamburgo e não um homem que caça uma merda de mistérios para vencer uma guerra sem sentido, tudo apenas para alegrar aquele filho da puta.\n\nOtto olhando pro nada grita.\n\nOtto: TÁ OUVINDO ISSO FÜRHER DE MERDA, SEU FILHO DA PUTA DESGRAÇADO, MILHARES DE CIDADÃOS ALEMÃES SOFRENDO EM LUGARES DEPLORAVEIS E IMUNDOS PARA APENAS AMACIAR SEU EGO E GÊNIO MALIGNO, SEU FILHO DA PUTA, QUANDO SAIR DESSE DESERTO EU VOU TE ENHER DE PORRADA E DEPOIS VOU TE MATAR!\n\nFriedrich, vendo a raiva de Otto, ele vai abraçar seu irmão como uma forma de se redimir com ele.\n\nEle apenas exclamou irmão.\n\nE logo depois Otto num estado de revolta o empurra e logo depois cai de costas na areia, Otto grita:\n\nOtto: IRMÃO? nunca mais me chama de irmão seu bosta,maldito veem me pedir perdão logo depois de afirmar que a apoia a porra de um regime genocida e que persegue pessoas como minha esposa, você não merece ser chamado de irmão e sim demônio, sim demônio porque quando você morrer você estar junto com seu ditadorzinho de merda vulgo capeta lá queimando nas chamas do inferno, tá ouvindo?\n\nFriedrich apenas sai chorando do lugar arrependido e vai direto para a tenda onde esta a tumba, e disfere um forte soco no rosto da estranha criatura e fala:\n\nFriedrich: seu desgraçado, seu despresivel de merda, graças a você eu e me irmão estamos brigados, enquanto você com esse sorrisinho estático na cara.\n\nA criatura tira o sorriso e finalmente abre os olhos revelando olhos dourados e a criatura diz:\n\nEstranha criatura: E culpa minha vocês estarem brigados? ou e apenas culpa sua de apoiar um babaca?\n\nEstranha criatura: Eu quero propor um negocio para você.\n\nEstranha criatura: alimente essa pedra baok com um corpo sadio, e você tera de tudo que você mais quer, o perdão de seu irmão e podera finalmente voltar para Hamburgo.\n\nFriedrich já pensando em fazer isso aceitou a proposta.\n\nFriedrich saiu da tenda e encontro o corpo de Saymon Des Löwe, um escavador, Friedrich, que maior e mais forte que Saymon o apagando com um forte soco no meio de sua face, Friedrich carregava o homem com bastante determinação, chegando até a pedra.\n\nFriedrich empurrou Saymon para dentro da pedra, a imensa pedra o absorvia, aos poucos ele ia se transformando em uma luz vermelha, a entidade sorria, ele se duro do sarcofago, ele levantou os dois braços para o ar, seus olhos que antes eram amarelos brilhantes haviam ficado totalmente brancos, do nada uma noite de lua sangrenta tomou espaço do ambiente, mas a lua mais parecia um olho vermelho, que derramava lagrimas de sangue flamejante, que causavam pânico e confusão no acampamento enquanto a criatura sorria com a agônia dos soldados e dos escavadores, Friedrich percebeu o que fez.\n\nOtto estava sem entender o que acontecendo, ele percebeu que uma imensa gota de sangue iria cair em cima dele, o jovem escavador estava sem reação e apenas se ajoelhou e começou a orar em um tom choroso, mas Friedrich reagiu de um jeito bastante rápido e se jogou em direção a seus irmão o impedindo de ser queimado pelo sangue flamejante.\n\nOtto ainda estava sem entender o que havia acontecido e apenas agradeceu a seu irmão por ter o salvado, Friedrich ajudou seu irmão a se levantar e os dois perceberam o caos, além das lagrimas de sangue eles haviam percebido que o nível de água do Nilo começou a subir muito rápido, o rio estava selvagem e furioso, o rio subiu levando todas as barracas, as gotas de sangue que caiam na água flutuavam como óleo, um óleo que ainda inflamava e queimava todas as pessoas.\n\nOs irmãos não podiam ficar parados eles tinham que deter a criatura, que estava levitando no ar, Otto pegou um revolver mas com a pólvora molhada ele não consegui atirar a entidade liberou uma poderosa rajada de vento frio de sua mão esquerda jogando Otto na correnteza ele se agarrou a uma rocha que tinha mas Friedrich foi esperto e pegou uma pá que tinha ali e acertou certeiramente derrubando, o fazendo cair de costas no chão, ele convulcionou por 5 segundos, ele rosnou para Friedrich, mas surgiu por trás da criatura Wolgang que mesmo sem sua mão esquerda, ele luta com ferocidade com sua mão direita, ele com um facão perfurava as costas da criatura em movimentos irregulares,fortes e rápidos, a criatura sentir muita dor.\n\nA criatura num rápido movimento com seu braço direito ele bateu em Wolfgang o lançando 15 metros de distância, e a criatura com o mesmo braço empurrou Friedrich em direção a pedra baok, ele bateu com suas costas na pedra, a pedra por causa do impacto liberou pequenas faíscas vermelhas e Friedrich estava inconsciente, a criatura foi num rápido movimento até a direção de Wolfgang tentando o afogar na inchente, a pá que Friedrich havia atirado anteriormente na criatura que antes estava presa na areia agora estava sendo levada na violenta correnteza do Nilo, a pá havia sido levada para perto de Otto que num rápido movimento agarrou a pá e a usou para andar contra a correnteza e quando ele estava com os pés firmes ele num forte movimento perfurou a barriga da criatura usando a ponta da pá.\n\nA criatura soltou um horripilante grito de dor e Wolfgang que antes estava sendo afogado rapidamente se recuperou e usou a faca que ainda mantinha firmemente em sua mão para realizar pequenos cortes nas pernas da criatura a desequilibrando, mas ela manifestou imensas garras em seus dedos ela tentava perseguir Otto que apenas caminhava para trás ele cambalheou e bateu levemente em um pedra ele estava com medo e não conseguia se levantar por tamanho medo, o rosto da criatura se dividiu em dois rostos e duas imensas bocas ambas cheias de de dentes afinados e afiados estavam prontos para devorar Otto, Wolfgang tentou reagiu mas tentaculos feitos de sombra o seguravam, era batalha perdida para os dois.\n\nMas uma esfera vermelha foi rapidamente em direção a criatura provocando uma pequena explosão a jogando a 25 metros.\n\nEra Friedrich que estava com sua iris vermelha, ele estava levitando, a criatura ficou assustada, pois ele estava com o poder da pedra baok, os dois começaram uma intensa luta.\n\nFriedrich, com seus punhos envolvidos com uma brilhante energia vermelha socava a criatura, a criatura fez varias copais de si mesma para tentar confundir Friedrich e o segurar, a criatura consegui por alguns segundos segurar Friedrich mas ele levantou seu braço esquerdo para o céu fazendo uma poderoso raio cair na água eletrecutando as duplicatas morrendo, Otto é Wolfgang eram protegidos por um campo de força vermelho.\n\nFriedrich estava ferido quase morrendo, mas ele usou grande parte de sua energia, e precionou o pescoço da criatura e da boca da criatura gritava enquanto sua energia escapava para fora de sua boca e olhos uma energia de cor verde neon, e emanou depois uma explosão de luz verde jogando Friedrich para longe.\n\nO nivel do nilo abaixou, e tudo voltou ao normal, exceto pela quantidade de cadaveres.\n\nOs três escavadores foram para Cartum se abrigarem e viverem discretamente, com isso duranto até 1848, a segunda guerra havia acabado.\n\nOs três finalmente conseguiram voltar para a Alemanha.\n\n09\/10\/1951.\n\nFriedrich descobriu por causa do contato que ele teve com as pedra baok que ele havia se tornado um agraciado, um tipo raro de humano, e lendo textos antigos perdidos, descobriu a \"Dinastia maldita\" sendo uma dinastia de faraós que tinham pactos com deuses e demônios, o ultimo herdeiro deles \"Amon Monek\" selou em seu próprio corpo a divindade da realidade \"Mottuh\" e agora ele teme ter libertado essa entidade.\n\nFriedrich aprendeu usar seus poderes da melhor forma, é regenerou a mão de Wolfgang, o mesmo sorriu e abraçou Friedrich, mas o mesmo não ficou por lá.\n\nFriedrich, entrou num navio que o levava diretamente para Nova York, para iniciar uma nova vida, Wolfgang e Otto continuaram em Hamburgo e tiveram filhos,netos e bisnetos, Otto e Wolfgang pereceram por causa da idade avançada, mas até hoje Friedrich esta vivo.\n\nDeserto 1955.\n\nA pedra Baok estava perdida no meio das areias, mas por lá um homem desconhecido de pele clara,cabelos pretos longos e escorridos,olhos verdes e usando terno e gravata, olhou com uma expressão sadica e de bastante tesão falando que tem lindos planos para aquela pedra mas que aquilo ficava para um futuro distante."},"690":{"title":"Is slenderina and slenderwoman the

Mrs Fran sighed and went back to teaching the rest of the class knowing that there was no use in questioning Julius.\n\n“I SWEAR… I’M GOING TO KILL YOU LAURA.” His dad had yelled one night after, Laura, Julius’s mum dropped a plate whilst serving dinner, “I’m so, so, sorry William!!” She had mumbled in fear, shielding her face with her thin bony arms. His dad grabbed her arm, throwing her down on the ground, then using her as a cleaning cloth to wipe the ceramic and food off the floor.\n\n“AHHH!” She had shrieked as ceramic shards dug into her thighs and hands, blood seeping out of the fresh, deep wounds. She struggled to push herself away from the man dragging her by the ankles, he dropped her ankles onto the floor. “Get up.” He had sternly demanded as Julius’s mum cried in pain, unable to move.\n\n“GET UP!” He boomed, hitting her across the face with the back of his hand. She started sobbing as he forced himself on top of her and started beating her. Julius sat there, staring numbly at the bloody scene, doing nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing.\n\nWhen the fight finished 2 hours later, Julius and his mum were sitting in the lounge room, in clean clothes and bandaged sores. After Julius’s dad had gotten bored of his wife Laura, he had moved onto Julius. Laura and Julius sat there, silently as William, watched his favourite cooking show.\n\nJulius’s mum got up “I am going to the toilet; I’ll be back in a bit…” She sniffed, Julius nodded, but sat very still hoping his dad would forget he was there. 30 minutes later William noticed his wife had been in the toilet for a while, so he demanded Julius to go check on her…\n\nJulius limped to the toilet, each step sent pain up his legs. “Mama…?” He asked putting his ear up to the bathroom door, the sound of dripping sent shivers down Julius’s spine. He lifted his hand to the doorknob, and turned…\n\n“Ok class that’s it for today, if you have any questions come see me after class.” Mrs Fran broke Julius out of his daydreaming, he sighs as he starts to pack up his scattered pencils and pens on his desk.\n\n Once all the students had left the class, Mrs Fran decided to check on Julius “Hey, Julius… I’ve noticed you’ve been more distracted in my classes are you ok?’’ Mrs Fran asked, Julius looks up to meet her worried eyes. “I'm fine.” He replied dryly, pushing past his teacher, knocking her arm gently.\n\n*Now its home time…* Julius thought to himself as he walked down the empty hallway. *Now I have to put up with* ***him***. He pushed the door, it gave way with a small click, the cold breeze flicked his messy hair, he groaned trying to fix his hair, but it was no use, the wind seemed to be infinite and annoying.\n\nThere was a strange eerie feeling as Julius made his way home slowly, he swore that he could hear faint whispering coming from behind him, he came to the decision to look behind himself, he saw two of his classmates, Jeff and Liu...\n\n Julius had heard that Randy and his two goons had bothered them that morning, but he decided not to ask them anything, as he turned back around, there was a glimpse of a tall, slender man… the man seemed to wear a black suit with black dress pants, but he decided to brush it off as just being sleepy.\n\nJulius walked up to his front door whilst Jeff and Liu continued to walk up the road. Julius didn’t know why but he felt extremely uneasiness around the brothers, even if they had joined the school that day… He still felt like if he were to be in a room alone with them, they would do something to him, something bad…\n\nAs Julius tiptoed inside his house, the door shutting a little to noisily behind gave a hint to his dad that he was home, Julius’s heart started thumping, terrified on how his dad’s reaction was going to be.\n\nHe crept to the kitchen, grabbing an apple, but as he was heading to his bedroom, the knife stand caught his eye, he had the urge to pick one of the knifes up, but Julius knew better… Julius’s hand rose up to the knife stand right as his dad came into the kitchen drowsily, “Hey kiddo… What are you doing?!”\n\nJulius froze in spot, his dad staring right at his hand, “Julius look at me.” His dad demanded, but Julius was still frozen, thinking about what to do… “Julius. LOOK AT ME.!” His dad boomed, Julius picked up a sharp looking knife and drooped his hand down to his waist, then looked up, meeting his dads eyes.\n\n“JULIUS DROP THE DAMN KNIFE DOWN!” But Julius just started snickering, William sighed reaching for Julius’s clenched hand, but Julius’s grip didn’t loosen “OI, BOY PUT THE FU\\*4ING KNIFE DOWN.” Julius broke free of his dads grip and slashed the knife at his father’s other hand right before it made it to him, William yelled in pain, grasping the lump which was once where his hand sat.\n\n“YOU FREAK!!” His dad cried, but Julius glared at the limp hand on the floor, then looked back up at his dad, “Dad...?” Julius murmured, Julius backed up into the kitchen door, “Dad! I’m sorry!! You startled me!!”\n\nJulius cried, dropping to the floor, and dropped the knife, “You little fucking freak.” His dad whispered, William grabbed Julius by the jaw, then rose his handless arm above Julius’s mouth, he was forcing Julius to drink the dripping blood from his arm, “AHUghK!??” Julius muffled, attempting to scream, but the fingers of his dad stopping him from properly screaming, Julius tried to push away his dad, but was unable to due to his weak body.\n\nAs the blood dripped into Julius’s mouth, something in his brain melted away, Julius swallowed the blood, the sweet metallic taste satisfied parts of Julius’s brain that were discovered by his dear father.\n\n “stop resisting Julius.” William moved his dripping arm away from Julius’s mouth, but kept Julius’s jaw open with his remaining hand, Julius bit down on his dad’s fingers, trying to taste more sweet blood. “OI YOU LITTLE BITCH!”, His dad yelped moving his hand out of Julius’s mouth. Julius rose his hand, and wiped the blood from the sides of his hands, licking his fingertips .\n\nWilliam stood up, feeling lightheaded from blood loss, Julius grinned, he licked the last of his father’s blood off his hands, face “Wah- what??!!” Julius’s dad nervously chuckled, shuffling back a bit.\n\n“What the fuck!?”  He cried, Julius giggled, his laugh sent shivers down his dad’s spine, “Thank you...!” Julius started laughing, laughing like a crazy person…\n\n“YOU NEVER PAID ATTENTION!!” Julius yelled, his laughing halted, and was now replaced with sobbing, “You didn’t even go to her funeral…”\n\n Julius cried, his breathing increasing, his dad just stood there, the dizziness increasing as he watched his son in horror, Julius’s dad wasn’t used to this kind of reaction from Julius, normally Julius would start pleading from him to stop hitting Julius, but now, this was different, and it totally creeped out William\n\n“Julius…”\n\nHe whispered as his son cried and sobbed with great emotional pain, but right the boys crying had stopped, Julius glared up from the top of his eyelids.\n\n“You. Never. Cared… YOU NEVER CARED…!” Julius screamed, his dad took another step back.\n\nAfter a few minutes Julius shot up, rushing himself at his dad, grabbing the knife from the blood splattered floor, gripping the handle, Julius started stabbing his dad’s body, making his dad fumble to the floor and cry out in pain.\n\n “AHHHH, JUL-” His dad’s voice was cut off as Julius dung the sharp blade into his dad’s throat.\n\nSoon Julius got bored of stabbing and cutting into his dads lifeless body, his face went hot, his eyes burned.\n\n “Dad… I love you.” He whispered in his father’s ear, warm tears dropped softly onto the lifeless body.\n\nJulius’s tears stopped as his chest stopped burning, and his face cooled, The boy started licking the sprayed blood from his body, the sweet, sweet taste of blood, it was gratifying.\n\nJulius cleaned up the lake of blood and his dads lifeless body, taking off the soaked clothing and squeezing the blood into his mouth, the taste of blood was making Julius feel emotions he thought he would never feel, the sound of a knife stabbing into flesh and the sound of bones cracking tickled his insides.\n\nJulius placed his dads cold, limp body onto the dining table, he rose his hand slowly, clenching the bloody sticky knife in his hand, he ran the blade down the bumpy torso, spilling out his dads organs, Julius smiled, he made his way to the kitchen cabinet, grabbing out plastic bags and a few jars.\n\nHe cut out the organs, placing them into their own bags, then he tipped his dad face down onto the bench, blood spilling out of his open body, Julius filled the jars with blood, scooping the liquid off the bench until there was nothing left but a thin layer of residue and the fleshy, organ-less body of his dad.\n\nAfter washing his skin, Julius went to his dad’s wardrobe and he took a dark grey fleece hoodless jumper, with a zip from the neck to the collar bone, he grabbed dark blue jeans. He went to the bathroom to put on the clothes, he chose this clothing in order to remember his father forever.\n\nHe slipped on a pair of black sneakers and grabbed a large duffel bag, putting the jars and zipped up plastic bags inside.\n\n He found a box of blue latex gloves and slipped a pair on, putting the remaining gloves into a separate compartment in his duffel bag. Julius made his way to the front door happy with his work. “Goodbye dad!!” Julius giggled waving to his dad’s body on the bench.\n\nJulius smiled constantly as he made his way to the woods, the feeling of being watched by the windows of neighbouring houses stuck in the back of his mind.\n\nHe slumped he shoulders and dragged his feet across the gravel roads, making his way to his favourite place, a childhood treehouse but there was another’s footsteps behind him, these footsteps sounded like those which would be made by designer dress shoes, but each time Julius would turn, no one would be following. Julius continued slowly trotting to the woods.\n\nWhen Julius finally made it into the woods, the feeling of being watched was growing, it felt like having a staring contest with multiple people. It was as if 2 or maybe 3 people were following him now, Julius’s mind raced *did people find out… what if someone saw… do I have blood on me?!* Julius paused and slowly turned around.\n\nBehind him was a man around Julius’s age, and an extremely tall pale creature. Julius started snickering, these people looked rather strange. “Hello Julius…” Julius’s eyes widened, the man who had spoked was tall pale man, now that Julius looked deeper into the mans appearance, he noticed his incredible height, black tentacle like things flew around behind the man, 5 of the tendrils flicked out and wrapped around his waist, legs and wrists.\n\nJulius’s face was in shock at this strange man’s abilities. The other man, who looked around Julius’s age let out a croaky snicker. The man seemed to have a greyish skin tone that poked out the sides of his blue mask, he wore black hooded jacket, black long pants, , brown messy hair peeking through the top part of his mask, the eyes of the mask seemed to be leaking a type of black goo, his eyes looked as if they were scratched and hollowed out.\n\nA tentacle pulled the bag off Julius’s bag, and gave it to the boy. The boy opened up the bag, and his eyes seemed to widen in surprise, “kiiDdnNy?!!” The boy croaked, his throat seemed to be parched like he’d been choaked recently, he reached for his mask and pulled it off his face, Julius squinted trying to make out the cause of the mans voice, his vocal throat seemed to be scratched out.\n\n“Not now Eyeless… Just hold the bag.” The man seemed to demand, the masked person looked up annoyed, the mask that once covered the front of his face was slightly lifted up to his nose bridge, three dark grey tongue seemed to poke out a bit of his dark grey lips. Julius found this interesting, he wondered how this man blood would taste.\n\nThe tall pale white man took notice of Julius’s thirst for blood, the man seemed happy and interested. The boy zipped open the duffel bag and opened few jars, sniffing the containments until he found a certain jar containing kidneys, he placed the jar under his arm and zipped the bag up throwing it gently to Julius’s feet. \n\nThe tall man in a fancy clean suit carefully placed Julius back on the ground knowing Julius’s curiosity will stop him from attacking, Julius picked up the bag and flipped it over his shoulder. “If you don’t want me to kill you Julius, you have to take an oath.” The man explained, Julius looked up trying to see what the man’s feature looked like, but he was met with a faceless cold creature leaning down towards him. Julius’s shocked face gaped open even more.\n\n “Ok…” Julius murmured, keeping his eyes on the man’s featureless face, he was happy to make a deal with these creatures, “ArrE YouU sUURe??” The boy growled, lightly tapping the lid of the kidney jar.\n\n “Yes.” Julius grinned finally relaxing his neck and looking away from the 12foot man, one of the tendrils reached out and lightly rested on Julius’s throat, “Repeat after me Julius.” Julius nodded and paid close attention to what the man would say. “I'm here to serve my master.” The man started, Julius repeated, “. I will not disobey or lie to my master.” Julius repeated again, “I will be with my partner whether I like it or not.”\n\n“After I accept this life, , I cannot return to my old one…”\n\n After Julius took the pledge, the tendril traced a circle onto his chest, then crossed it out once. The mark seemed to be invisible for a few seconds before changing into a black tattoo like marking.\n\nEyeless Jack grinned, before pulling his mask back down to cover his face, and walked up to Julius, putting his arm around his shoulder, “HAHAHHaaaha!” E.J cackled Julius grinned with his newfound cannibal friend, the tall man stood still observing the two, Julius grinned as E.J guided hi new companion to their home.\n\n **I hope you enjoyed this story, it is a repost edited version of the original story I posted, sooooo yeah, this creepypasta is named Hunger btw :\\]**"},"694":{"title":"Cursed Train - my new horror story ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f6jah4\/cursed_train_my_new_horror_story\/","flair":"Video","author":"JabroniCorleone","selftext":"Hi everybody,\nhope you like my new horror story 🙂 I would like to receive subs, comments and likes from you 💜\n\nCursed Train - scary stories to fall asleep to\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/WZbFXusxA7Y?si=s6n3v76fFM_BnC5D"},"695":{"title":"A Devouring Beauty","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f64c1e\/a_devouring_beauty\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"arulzokay","selftext":"\n\nTrigger Warning: Suicidal Ideation \n\nWhen my face started peeling, I blamed the new face wash my cousin had recommended. Despite its high ratings on best-of lists and glowing reviews from TikTok influencers, it was clear that my skin was reacting badly to it. I liked the results from the few times I used it, but I couldn’t risk further damage, so I threw the cleanser in the trash.\n\nHowever, a week later, my face became much worse instead of getting better. The texture of my skin was scaly and rough, like a snake’s. I racked my mind for a possible cause but came up blank.\n\nIt looked revolting, and the itching was unbearable. My constant scratching drew blood, and the underside of my nails was clogged with dead skin.\n\nEverything came to a head the day I got my braids done.\n\nI spent hours at the stylist’s. Finally, she dipped my braids into boiling water and wrapped them in a towel to prevent burning me.\n\nShe gasped when she uncovered my head, and I felt lightheaded as my scalp throbbed, my heart pounding painfully.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I asked, but she didn’t respond. “What’s wrong?” I demanded as my vision began to burn and blur.\n\nI snatched her mirror and saw my reflection. The sight was so horrifying I thought my head would implode.\n\nNearly every braid had fallen out, though a few clung to my scalp by bloody, viscous threads. My fingers trembled as they dug into my skull, feeling like they were sinking into decaying fruit.\n\nThe skin at my hairline had started to erode, flaking like brittle parchment. My skin wasn’t just peeling; it was dissolving. Raw, crimson flesh exposed veins and tendons that struggled to keep up with the rapid decay.\n\nDark blood dripped from my rotting forehead, pooling at the tip of my nose before dripping onto the mirror. More blood followed, splattering thickly, a torrent of red.\n\nI slammed the mirror down and fled to my car, shaking so badly I could barely grip the steering wheel. I ignored the stylist’s texts and calls demanding payment. Was she out of her fucking mind?\n\nWhen I got home, I locked myself in the bathroom. My scalp was a roadmap of raw flesh and patches of skin. Every small bit of movement hurt, and I couldn’t stop myself from rocking on the cool tile and crying. I wailed, screamed, and cursed even though the pain felt like it might kill me.\n\nAs time went by, I deteriorated further. Painful boils bubbled across my cheeks and forehead, pulsating in rhythm with my racing heartbeat. Upon bursting, they released thick, yellow pus that oozed down my face like molten wax. The surrounding skin was blackened and peeled, exposing raw, bleeding tissue that wept a mixture of blood and infection.\n\nConfusion and fear gripped me. All I had done was buy a cleanser—now I was a monster. Was desiring beauty a crime?\n\nMy face was a battlefield of decay. I was the embodiment of grotesque. My eyes, swollen and red, were now tinged with a sickly yellow hue—reptilian. Thick mucus gathered at the corners, dripping in long, stringy threads, clinging to my ragged eyelids.\n\nStaring into the mirror was triggering and from it came a sudden, sharp memory from a week ago at my cousin’s birthday party.\n\n\n✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺\n\n\nThere had been a woman at the party , a so-called spiritualist, who was undeniably a witch. My cousin had always been eccentric, even more so since her boyfriend vanished under mysterious circumstances. She had delved into mystical practices—spells, curses, rituals—so it wasn’t surprising that this year, she hosted a séance led by a spiritualist, a witch.\n\n“Séances are more than just a gateway to the dead. They peel back the layers of the world, revealing the truths we hide from—even the ones inside us,” she intoned in a strange monotone.\n\nI had been skeptical, I admit.\n\nBitch, crazy, I thought, lifting my wine glass to avoid her intense stare. She had cornered me for conversation in the easiest way possible.\n\n“You’re beautiful,” she had said.\n\n“Thank you, I’m aware,” I replied.\n\nThen she had sat across from me during the séance, her eyes unblinking and black as voids, reflecting the flickering candlelight. I had been drunk and unsettled. Unnerved at her constant staring, I stuck out my tongue, and when that didn’t yield the desired reaction, I flipped her off.\n\nThat made her smile, and when she did, her lips stretched unnaturally wide to reveal jagged, blackened teeth.\n\nHer grin stretched wider and wider until a figure slowly emerged from the back of her gaping throat. The witch gagged and convulsed violently, and after vomiting, the pale, long-limbed figure collapsed into itself and became ash, which scattered across the table, twinkling like starlight.\n\nThe figure rose with a twitch, its long black hair cascading down its back. When it turned to face me, I screamed, but no sound came out.\n\nIt was a woman—a very dead woman. Her rotting skin hung loosely from her bones; putrid green slime oozed through her pores. Her hollow eyes leaked a dark liquid, and her mouth was a cavernous abyss filled with jagged teeth.\n\nShe lurched toward me, her movements jerky. I wanted to run, but I was rooted to the ground. She tapped my forehead, sending a searing pain through my skull. Her touch burned trails into my flesh as she traced my eyes, outlined my lips, and then, with brutal strength, tore my face off.\n\nThe world blurred into a blazing inferno as I screamed The witch held my face, inspecting it with hollow eyes before pressing it against her skull.\n\nThe skin fused to her bones, reshaping to fit her features. She turned to me, my face now hers, and smiled—a cruel, mocking grin.\n\nThe pain was unbearable, a searing agony consuming every nerve as if my soul was being scorched. I screamed and tried , to claw my way out of the inferno, but I was trapped.\n\nI died.\n\n✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺\n\nExcept no, I hadn’t. \n\nI awoke lying on the floor, wet and cold. My face throbbed as though on fire. The room was too bright, the lights glaring down, revealing a distorted blur of faces hovering above.\n\nMy cousin knelt beside me, her eyes wide with fear. The others stood around us, their expressions puzzled and concerned.\n\n“Esme, are you okay?” my cousin’s trembling voice cut through the haze. She was terrified.\n\nI struggled to focus. “What happened?” I rasped, snatching the towel she held out to me. I swiped at my face, and the towel tinged dark pink. Wine. These bitches had thrown wine at me to wake me up.\n\nI would deal with that later because right now, a witch was on the loose, and she was on the hunt for bad bitches like myself.\n\nPanic surged as I scanned the room again. “Where is she?” I muttered, anger tightening my throat. “Where the fuck is she?”\n\n“Where is who?” my cousin asked, brow furrowing.\n\nI turned to her, desperation creeping into my voice. “The woman you hired to lead the séance? The spiritualist—the witch who handed me the wine—she told me I was beautiful! She wouldn’t stop staring at me. Where is she?”\n\n\nMy cousin exchanged uneasy glances with her friends, then looked back at me. “Esme, there was no witch—no spiritualist—here. It was just us. Are you sure you’re okay?”\n\nI shook my head; confusion and fear tangled my thoughts. I reached into my pocket, pulling out my compact mirror. Flipping it open, I stared at my reflection, half-expecting a monstrous distortion. But no—the face in the mirror was flawless, unmarked, beautiful—me.\n\nHad I imagined it? The memory of the witch felt so real, but doubt crept in. My cousin’s words echoed—“There was no one else”—and for a terrifying moment, I wondered if she was right.\n\n“Esme,” my cousin’s voice was gentle, coaxing me back to reality. “There was no one else. Maybe you just…imagined it. Perhaps you had too much to drink?”\n\n“No,” I interrupted, hollow as I pushed past her to grab more wine. I poured and watched the crimson liquid swirling like blood. I downed it, the alcohol burning but failing to quell the fear gnawing at me.\n\n“The problem is I haven’t drunk enough,” I muttered. God, remembrance is a bitch.\n\n✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺✨🌺\n\nMy bathroom resembles  a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe sink overflows with a brackish mix of water and something darker. Clumps of hair cling to the porcelain, tangled in the drain.\n\nMirror shards litter the floor, and everything is stained with my blood. My handprints are smeared across the walls, like desperate warnings from something wild, cornered, and feral.\n\nIt stinks in here.\n\nThe air is thick with the stench of rot, a suffocating cloud of decay. My skin—what’s left of it—feels like it’s wilting under the oppressive smell.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was indescribably beautiful. Now, I’m a monster because a jealous witch stole my face.\n\nI’m tired of crying. I’m so fucking tired of crying. Haven’t I said how much it hurts? My tears burn like acid, carving channels into my skin.\n\nWhy bother? What’s the point? My mind spirals. How am I even still alive?\n\nBe done with it, a voice hissed, cold and convincing. What else do you have to live for? Slit your throat, tear out your veins. Chew through your fucking wrists if you have to. Anything to be done; just be done.\n\nDoesn’t bleeding out in a hot bath sound like paradise? The warmth, the release, knowing it’s all over. No more mirrors, no more ugliness, just silence. Sweet, oblivious silence.\n\nBut wait—what was it that witch had said? What had she told me?\n\n“You’re beautiful.”\n\n“Thanks, I’m aware.”\n\nNo, not that as important as it is. Something else. Something about a veil?\n\n“Séances are more than just a gateway to the dead. They peel back the layers of the world, revealing the truths we hide from—even the ones inside us,” she’d said, her voice a monotone hum.\n\nTruths inside us. What did she mean by that?\n\nA realization bursts through the darkness, as ripe and putrid as a boil. Inner beauty? If my insides matched my outsides, I’d be a horror worse than this.\n\nSuddenly, it all makes sense. I’ve been clinging to something that was never really mine. I was a hollow shell, pretty on the outside, rotten to the core.\n\nWhy not own it? If the world’s going to see me as a monster, then I’ll be the most beautiful monster they’ve ever seen.\n\nI’ll find that witch and demon and take back what’s mine. No one fucks with me and walks away. But why stop there? I’ll steal beauty from anyone who dares to cross my path. Their hair, their skin, their smiles—whatever I want. I’ll carve it out and stitch it together like a patchwork quilt of stolen beauty.\n\nBecause if I’ve learned anything, it’s that beauty is power. And power is the only thing that matters.\n\nI close my eyes, savoring the plan forming in my mind. A smile spreads across my face, sharp enough to tear your throat out.\n\nI laugh. It starts as a chuckle, a ridiculous little hiccup of sound I can’t quite suppress. But it quickly spirals into something wilder, something uncontrollable. The laughter comes in waves, harsh and guttural, until it claws its way out of my throat in a series of ragged, choking sobs.\n\nI’m on all fours as my body convulses. My stomach heaves violently, and I vomit, the acidic taste mixing with the coppery tang of blood. It’s the greatest damn release in the world.\n\nThe floor is slick beneath me, and thousands of my eyes stare back at me. I see my distorted face in each mirror shard, like some fucked-up kaleidoscope. I am everywhere, yet I am nothing—just a broken thing in a room full of broken glass.\n\nI roll onto my back, feeling the sharp sting of glass pressing into my skin, and giggle helplessly as I stare up at the ceiling with a smile that feels too wide, too sharp—sharp enough to rip someone’s throat out.\n\nIt’s decided. If I can’t be beautiful, then nobody else can.\n\nI’ll take it from everyone. I’ll carve it out, peel it off, gouge out what is mine. I’ll chew on it piece by piece until there’s nothing left. I’ll rip it from their souls and stitch it into my skin.\n\nAnd when all is said and done, I’ll make sure the last face they see is mine.\n\nConsider it a kindness—a favor, really. If pride goeth before a fall, they should be grateful because I’ll be their willing savior.\n\nI’ll cure you of what ails you, my dear."},"696":{"title":"If at night, you hear something in your house at bed, remember that you aren’t alone…","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f6i9ns\/if_at_night_you_hear_something_in_your_house_at\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Pretend_Arachnid7859","selftext":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kv6rbnzy28md1.jpg?width=1437&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cefb385d0d24f54f65c6b6cd0152f842b78084fb\n\nKnown as the “House man”, is a mysterious entity that’s been recorded entering people’s bedrooms and killing them in their sleep.

It’s a tale of horror, of madness, and of a relentless descent into darkness that began with something as simple as a missing finger.\n\nIt all started one seemingly ordinary morning. I woke up in my small apartment in downtown Seattle, stretching and yawning as I tried to shake off the remnants of sleep. As my hand grazed my face, I felt a sharp pang of pain. Groggily, I looked down and saw that my pinky finger was missing—completely gone, as if it had never been there. Blood oozed from the clean stump where my finger should have been.\n\nPanic set in instantly. I scrambled out of bed, my heart racing, and rushed to the bathroom. There was no blood on the sheets, no sign of a struggle, nothing to indicate what had happened. How could this be? I stared at my hand in the mirror, trying to make sense of it. It wasn’t just a cut; the entire finger was missing, and the wound looked as though it had been professionally cauterized.\n\nI called 911, but my explanation sounded insane even to my own ears. They sent an ambulance, and I was taken to the hospital. The doctors were baffled. They performed all sorts of tests, but they couldn’t determine how I had lost my finger or who could have done it. I was sent home with a prescription for painkillers and a referral to a psychiatrist.\n\nThat night, I barely slept. My mind was racing with fear and confusion. When I did manage to drift off, my dreams were filled with shadows and whispers, an ever-present sense of dread. I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat, and the nightmare continued in the waking world. My ring finger was now gone. The same clean, cauterized wound. I screamed in horror, my voice echoing through the empty apartment.\n\nOver the next few weeks, it happened every single night. Each morning I would wake up to find another finger missing. I sought help from doctors, but they had no answers. The psychiatrist suggested it might be some sort of extreme self-harm or sleepwalking disorder, but I knew I wasn’t doing this to myself. I set up cameras around my bedroom, hoping to catch whatever was happening on tape, but the footage showed nothing. I would simply be there one moment, then the next moment a finger would be missing.\n\nI became obsessed with finding out what was happening to me. My work suffered, my relationships deteriorated. I isolated myself, spending hours researching anything that could explain my situation—occult practices, rare medical conditions, supernatural phenomena. Nothing seemed to fit.\n\nAs the fingers on my left hand vanished, then those on my right, I fell into a deep depression. The pain was excruciating, both physically and mentally. I began to question my sanity. Was I truly losing my mind?\n\nOne night, as I sat in the darkened living room, clutching the remaining stumps of my fingers, I heard a faint whispering sound. It was coming from my bedroom. Gathering what little courage I had left, I crept down the hallway and slowly opened the door. The whispering grew louder, a cacophony of voices all speaking in hushed tones. I saw nothing unusual, but the feeling of being watched was overwhelming.\n\nI started sleeping with the lights on, but it made no difference. Each night, another finger disappeared, and soon my toes followed. My hands and feet were becoming grotesque, mangled stumps. Desperation consumed me. I became a prisoner in my own home, too terrified to sleep but too exhausted to stay awake.\n\nOne night, I resolved to stay up until I found out what was happening. I downed cups of coffee, swallowed caffeine pills, and paced the floor, my eyes darting to every shadow. Around 3 a.m., I felt a sudden, overwhelming drowsiness. Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t fight it. My eyelids grew heavy, and I collapsed onto the couch.\n\nI woke up to the most excruciating pain I’d ever felt. My feet—my toes were gone. I screamed, the agony overwhelming every other sense. Blood pooled around the stumps of my feet. The pain was so intense that I blacked out.\n\nWhen I came to, I was in the hospital. They had managed to stop the bleeding and had sedated me heavily. The doctors were bewildered. They kept me for observation, but even under constant surveillance, another toe went missing. It was then that I was transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\nMy time there was a blur of medication, therapy sessions, and endless questions. The doctors tried to assure me that I was safe, but I knew better. Each morning, despite the heavy sedation and locked doors, another digit was gone. They couldn’t keep me there forever, and eventually, they had no choice but to release me. The case was deemed a psychological anomaly—something beyond their understanding.\n\nBack in my apartment, the pattern continued. My life became a waking nightmare. I took to wandering the streets at night, hoping to escape whatever malevolent force was targeting me. But no matter where I went, I would wake up to find another piece of me missing.\n\nI began to notice changes in my reflection. At first, it was subtle—a fleeting shadow, a faint outline. But as my condition worsened, the reflection became more distinct. It was a figure standing just behind me, featureless and dark, watching me with an intensity that chilled my soul.\n\nI turned to the only option I had left: I sought out a reclusive occult expert, a man named Marcus Gray. He lived in a ramshackle house on the outskirts of town, surrounded by talismans and protective charms. When I told him my story, he listened without interruption, his face growing grimmer with each word.\n\n“There are entities that feed on human suffering,” Marcus said, his voice barely above a whisper. “They exist in the shadows, preying on the vulnerable. You’ve been marked by one of these entities.”\n\n“Why? Why me?” I asked, my voice breaking.\n\n“Once marked, it’s almost impossible to escape. It feeds on your fear, your pain. The more you struggle, the stronger it becomes.”\n\nDesperation clawed at me. “Is there any way to stop it?”\n\nMarcus sighed heavily. “There’s a ritual—an ancient one. It might sever the connection, but it’s incredibly dangerous. If it fails, the entity will consume you entirely.”\n\nI had no choice. The ritual was my last hope. Marcus explained the process: a series of incantations, symbols drawn in blood, and an offering of personal items. It had to be performed at the witching hour, under the light of a waning moon.\n\nThe night of the ritual, I gathered everything Marcus had instructed me to bring. He prepared the space, drawing intricate symbols on the floor and lighting black candles. The air was thick with tension, and the shadows seemed to dance with anticipation.\n\nMarcus began chanting in a language I didn’t understand, his voice resonating with power. He motioned for me to step into the center of the symbols. As I did, a wave of nausea hit me, and the room spun violently. The shadows grew darker, enveloping us.\n\nSuddenly, a piercing cold filled the room, and the entity revealed itself. It was a mass of darkness, shifting and writhing with malevolent intent. I could feel its hunger, its desire to consume me.\n\nMarcus continued the incantations, his voice growing louder, more urgent. The entity shrieked, a sound that cut through my very soul. The pain was unbearable, as if every cell in my body was being torn apart.\n\nThe candles flickered, and the symbols on the floor glowed with an eerie light. The entity surged towards me, and I screamed in terror. Marcus shouted the final words of the ritual, and a blinding light filled the room.\n\nWhen I came to, the entity was gone. The room was silent, the air heavy with the aftermath of the struggle. Marcus lay on the floor, unconscious but alive. I checked my hands and feet—nothing had changed. My fingers and toes were still missing, but the pain had subsided.\n\nMarcus stirred, his face pale and drawn. “It’s over,” he said weakly. “The connection is severed.”\n\nRelief washed over me, but it was short-lived. The damage had been done. My body was permanently scarred, and the psychological trauma would never fully heal. I moved away from Seattle, trying to start over in a place where the memories wouldn’t haunt me.\n\nBut the scars remain, a constant reminder of the nightmare I endured. Every now and then, I catch a glimpse of a shadow out of the corner of my eye, and my heart skips a beat. The fear never truly goes away. And in the dark of night, I can still hear the faint whispering, a chilling reminder that some horrors can never be fully escaped.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a situation that defies explanation, heed my warning: there are forces in this world beyond our understanding, entities that feed on our pain and fear. Once marked, you may never escape. The cost of survival is steep, and the scars—both physical and mental—will last a lifetime."},"698":{"title":"The Darkness has a Secret","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f5w64y\/the_darkness_has_a_secret\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BrAiNpUrGe000","selftext":"   It started simply enough, and I'm sure everyone has been in a similar situation. I awoke to something but had no clue what, I just felt... watched. And you know how the dark plays tricks on your vision. A black room can appear to have mysterious visitors outlined in the blackness, it can seem to have any number of nefarious creatures watching you.\n\n   Like most anyone else has experienced, I heard sounds. It was that usual hum that true silent darkness usually has but for whatever reason, I noticed something different. That hum wasn't a hum, but whispers. I couldn't understand the feint words being spoken and I wasn't sure if it was because it wasn't in English or if it was too quiet to be deciphered but it terrified me to imagine what it was that what speaking in the darkness.\n\n   That's when I noticed the whispers stop. The real silence actually hurt my ears, but it was the movement that made me grab my phone and turn on the flashlight. My lamp is connected to the light switch on the wall so my phone was my only light.\n\n   The gentle glow of the smartphone screen as well as the flashlight on my phone were all that lit the room and the darkness outside the orb of light that surrounded me began to move and contort. The shadow itself shifted and the whispers returned, sounded more angry than they were before.\n\n   It was then that the truth dawned on me and I kicked the blanket off of me and pulled my legs to my chest, being sure to keep all of me covered with the dim light of my phone.\n\n   Originally, my fear was that there was something in the darkness and it could grab me at any moment but the realization was sudden and more than terrifying... there is nothing in the darkness to be feared, the darkness itself IS ALIVE. Most of us are safe because we are oblivious to it. It's when someone figures it out, the darkness gets angry.\n\n   The whispers got louder and I understood them now.\n\n   \"You hear the voice, you know what's true, now the darkness comes for you.\"\n\n   The whispers repeat over and over as I type this. The air around my bed has become thicker the farther from the source of light it is. It's like the darkness itself has mass to it. I tried to get out of bed and as soon as I lowered my foot, I felt a mass tugging on me.\n\n   I'm trapped on my bed, the whispers taunting me, separated by a soft chuckle. I can hear scraping on my floor and walls. The ceiling rains dust on me from the darkness moving or pulsing in the room... it wants me because I know the truth, there is nothing to fear in the darkness because it is the darkness itself that is the danger.

The 20th of August was a Saturday, so being woken up around 7am to such a commotion was an unpleasant surprise. This was until, however, I realized it could finally give me the opportunity to know some history of the abandoned home. Unfortunately, the police were, understandably, unable to speak during the open investigation. They did, however, let me know that the owner of the home has been marked as a threat to himself and others. The man said for me to be on the lookout and that if I see anything out of the ordinary, I should give them a call.\n\nA day or two passed and I noticed the police had accidentally left the front door ajar. I made a mental note to close the door when I got a chance so mother nature could not make her way inside.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9vqgumy1e2md1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af6f8442c6ae22c5612a11cdab3f998575ce179a\n\nThe next day, I walked from my property to close the door. I was perplexed as I approached and realized the door was now closed.\n\nI decided to walk around the home to inspect its condition and ensure the back door was not open or unlocked. Upon getting to the rear of the house, I noticed there was a small bedroom missing a lower windowpane. The opening was small, but it was sizable enough to fit a smaller person. I noticed the back door was closed, however, I reached up to grab the door handle. I was caught off guard by the door gliding open with ease, without me even turning the handle. I took a momentary glance, and closed the door. After that, I went to the open window to peek inside before I left. As I carefully placed my head in the window, I noticed a sticky note on the floor in the bedroom, lying in front of a closed door directly to my left with “Bathroom” written in Sharpie on it. It was close, so I reached inside and grabbed the note.\n\nAs I was taking in my last moment in the room, I was petrified to hear the back door, about 4 feet to the right of the window, smash against the wall I was leaning on. I pulled my head out of the window and, without hesitation, ran around the left side of the house back toward my property. When I got to the front, I saw a white male, around 5’8 in height, running in a similar direction as me. We saw each other clearly. After noticing that we were running in similar directions, he turned around and started to go the opposite way. I stood stationary with a racing heart, sifting through my pockets for my phone to call the police. I knew, however, it would be too late. When they showed up, I offered the police the best description I could give, and they went on their way. This time, we made sure the door was closed and locked.\n\nWhen I got back home, I decided to try and figure out the history of the property, the owner, or anything I could find that could help give me peace of mind after these two incidents. I was unsure of the address, so I went to Zillow to see if it is listed there — I have noticed Zillow typically has a surprising amount of information. Fortunately, the home had been for sale in 2011, until it was quickly purchased, so I was able to find basic documentation, including the address.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wktb98z3e2md1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbacabf1598ecb1598af8465b370988ddb665e3b\n\nWhy would someone buy a home just to leave it abandoned? The interior was in decent shape; and aside from the porch, the exterior could be cleaned up easily.\n\nUpon researching the address for an hour or two, I, disappointingly, produced no information. Finally, I decided to check out the county arrest record as a final effort for information.\n\nThe most recent arrest was a man charged with “Possession of Schedule II,” “Possession of Schedule IV,” and “Attempting to Elude.” The last charge was a massive red flag. My local Sheriff’s office does not seem to release mugshots publicly, so I could not identify the man's appearance on their side. Instead, I copied his name and searched it into Google. I was met by not only a youthful photo of the guy I saw hours earlier, but a plethora of articles on both a local and national level about him. He has been arrested many times, but I was stunned as I started scrolling articles about one arrest.\n\nFor my safety, I am going to keep every identity and location confidential.\n\nIn April of 2012, he was arrested and accused of killing a hiker. Articles from 2014 unpack new case discoveries and updates, but also go into the personal life of the murderer. Newly publicized records at the time show that he was the caretaker of his aunt. His aunt had dementia and needed help with everyday tasks; help that he was meant to provide. His aunt passed away in November of 2012, alone. In the latter half of 2014, the trial was finally starting, and the man was making a spectacle of himself. Local news covered his trial in detail and capitalized off of it. Armed by documentation and well-respected lawyers, the man was able to successfully pull off an extremely rare insanity plea and was sentenced to “mandatory treatment,” whatever that means. While the initial arrest was made about 2 hours away, I was shocked to see past news coverage showing the house in the background. According to 2014 coverage, the home belonged to the aunt of the killer. This home is where they lived at the time of the incident.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zi2z7tt5e2md1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308bed3a5213c54aad75b32615f2b1644e67a20d\n\nWhile the status of the home is unclear, I wonder what the future holds for it and who owns it. I have been thinking about it a lot lately, and honestly, I am starting to feel uneasy about the potential risks."},"700":{"title":"Beneath the Surface","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f5sn0n\/beneath_the_surface\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TheFroggedon","selftext":"My name is Tommy. I was just your average guy living in a quiet suburban neighborhood, where the days rolled by like a gentle stream. The sun spilled golden light across tree-lined streets, and the air was filled with the scent of cut grass and blooming flowers. It was nice, really—peaceful. Crime was almost a myth here, just something whispered about in the news but never experienced firsthand. All the neighbors were friendly, always ready with a smile or a wave as they tended to their yards or walked their dogs.\n\nWe had our weekend get-togethers too, those warm nights filled with laughter, barbecues, and stories shared over the flickering glow of fire pits. The kids would run around, their giggles ringing out like music, while adults swapped tales of mundane life and the occasional local gossip. Sometimes, I’d catch myself standing in my front yard, watching it all unfold—the small-town charm that wrapped around our lives like a well-worn blanket. It was easy to get lost in the normalcy of it all, to think that this is what life would always be like.\n\nBut beneath the surface of that peaceful exterior, I didn’t realize how quickly everything could change.\n\nThen there was Jack, my neighbor across the street, a guy I hadn’t paid much attention to until recently. Your typical bachelor—same routine, different girl, like clockwork. Every month, he would introduce a stunning woman to our neighborhood barbecues, their laughter mingling with beer and smoke, only to vanish shortly after. But a month ago, something shifted. Her name was Lily, and she was unlike any of Jack's previous flings. For the first time, I felt an undeniable spark, a strange connection that pulled me in deeper than I had ever anticipated.\n\nOur first conversation took place over the grill, where the smoke curled around us like a wisp of destiny. It felt as if the world around us faded, and all I could focus on was her genuine smile and lively spirit. In that crowded space, something tethered us inexplicably, as though we were the only two people inhabiting the moment, sharing a connection that felt both electrifying and frightening.\n\nAs the weeks rolled on, we exchanged stories and laughter, our conversations deepening into something meaningful. We debated classic movies and shared our favorite lines, each moment building on the last. My heart raced at the sound of her infectious laughter, and her quiet strength drew me in like gravity. She was fiercely capable, unafraid to voice her opinions, everything I had yearned for but never thought I could have.\n\nYet as entranced as I was, a nagging voice in the back of my mind reminded me of the reality—she was Jack’s. I watched from the sidelines, a silent observer, cherishing our budding friendship while sulking in the knowledge that she was destined to be another fleeting flame in Jack’s rotation. I knew all too well how these things played out, and even as my feelings for her grew, I felt powerless to change the course of events that loomed ahead.\n\nOne morning, while I collected my mail, I spotted Jack and Lily arguing heatedly. Their raised voices prickled at my spine, but I didn’t dare intrude. From my distance, I could sense an underlying tension—something troubling. My gut twisted as I contemplated texting Lily later, but for now, I’d respect their privacy. Something was off.\n\nAs soon as I stepped inside my house, I became more curious. I decided to send off a couple of texts to Lily and called her phone, but hours passed with no response. A knot tightened in my stomach—where was that quick-witted banter I had come to rely on? Anxiety began to creep in as the silence stretched on. Days went by without a word, and it felt heavier with each moment. This wasn’t like Lily. She wasn’t the type to just disappear without a trace. Just days ago, we were joking about our favorite movies, sharing laughs that now seemed like a distant memory. I ran my fingers through my hair, battling the unease that settled in my chest.\n\nThe next logical step was to confront Jack. I spotted him through the window, bustling around his living room, grabbing his things as he got ready to leave for work. The morning sun spilled into the room, casting a warm glow over everything, but all I felt was the chill of my own anxiety. I hesitated, foot hovering just above the ground, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest.\n\nWith each step toward his front door, I fiddled with the edges of my shirt, trying to smooth away the tension that coiled tightly in my stomach. My mind raced, grappling with the words I needed to say, but they felt heavy as lead—trapped somewhere between my thoughts and my throat.\n\nWhen I finally reached the door, I took a breath, determined to sound casual, as if this was just another morning. “Hey, man, where’s Lily?” I forced out, trying for a relaxed tone, but it came out pinched and strained. My gut twisted tighter with every syllable, the worry settling like a weight on my chest.\n\n“Oh, we broke up,” he shrugged, flicking his hand dismissively like he was swatting away a fly. “She just left.”\n\nJust like that? Something about his nonchalance made my skin crawl. Hadn’t they seemed happy together, or was that just more of Jack’s charm working its magic? He had a reputation for churning through girlfriends like disposable razors, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was lying. I searched his face for clues, for any hint of guilt, but he was adept at lying without batting an eye.\n\nLily wouldn’t just \"leave.\" My instincts screamed at me. The thought of her slipping away, vanishing into the night without a trace, sent a shiver up my spine. So I formulated a plan that was undoubtedly obsessive: I’d keep an eye on Jack's house overnight. I had notebooks full of facts and theories about human behavior and social dynamics, but now they felt useless. It felt a bit unhinged. Monitoring the scene like some deranged detective, I was well aware of how it looked from the outside.\n\nThat night found me stationed in my living room, the curtain drawn just enough to observe without being seen. Hours crawled by, punctuated only by the distant sounds of the neighborhood settling in for the night. I was ready to give up when a shadow flicked across Jack's porch.\n\nThe dim light from a nearby street lamp flickered, casting a sickly glow over the scene unfolding before me. Jack’s figure was hunched over, muscles straining against whatever he was dragging. My blood turned to ice as recognition hit me, crashing through the haze of disbelief. It was Lily. Somehow, I knew without needing to see her face, without needing to confirm. My breath quickened, and I fought the urge to scream. This was no ordinary late-night rendezvous; this was a crime unfolding right before my eyes.\n\nI clutched my phone, torn between the urge to call for help and the paralyzing fear that any movement would shatter the moment, might send Jack running, might erase my chance to understand what was happening. My rational part screamed for clarity, but as my instincts took over, every thought seemed to blend into panic and desperation.\n\nWhy was he dragging her? The shed—the very word felt ominous, a foreboding backdrop to my nightmare. The shed was a relic, a forgotten piece of clutter that had always been there, but now it felt like some sinister altar to whatever dark ritual was taking place. I strained to catch the details—his movements, his demeanor. Was he panicking? Was he calm? It was hard to tell from this distance, and every second felt like a thousand. Adrenaline surged through my veins, my mind awash in disbelief. I couldn’t move, could barely breathe.\n\nJack finally reached the shed’s door, pausing for a brief moment. Then, with a sweeping motion that sent my heart plummeting, he yanked the door open and pulled her inside, where darkness engulfed them both. I was left with only the fluttering shadows cast by the streetlamp, now eerily still, echoing my own heart’s racing uncertainty. I sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. My mind whirled with questions that only deepened my sense of dread. What did I do now? Should I go to the police? No, that would only alert Jack. Should I go by myself? That idea felt insane—an unarmed confrontation with a man who was clearly capable of so much more than I’d ever imagined.\n\nThe fear of what would happen to Lily consumed me. I decided to act as soon as I was sure Jack had retreated for the night. I tiptoed downstairs, my heart racing, each step amplifying the anxiety blooming in my chest. I had to know what was in that shed.\n\nAs I approached, the air felt thick, electric. My flashlight flickered ominously, yet I pressed on. The shed loomed ahead, its silhouette a dark smudge against the night sky. I inhaled deeply before gripping the rusty handle, the metal cold in my palm. With a creak that sounded far too loud, I opened the door, half-expecting something to leap out at me. Inside, I encountered nothing more than tools and gardening supplies. Yet, beneath the surface of this normalcy, a suffocating sense of dread clung to me, wrapping around my throat like a serpent.\n\nA rickety shelf lined the far wall, cluttered with pots, half-empty bags of fertilizer, and oddly shaped gardening implements that looked more suited for a horror movie set than a backyard. But it was the push mower, parked unceremoniously atop a trapdoor, that caught my attention. Its metallic surface gleamed dully in the light of my beam, an innocent enough object in daylight, yet now it felt like a tombstone marking something buried beneath. As I knelt to examine the trap door closely, I noticed the faint outlines of iron hinges protruding from the frame—rusted and worn, as if they hadn’t seen the light of day in an eternity. Its surface was worn, a mottled mix of wood and metal, nearly camouflaged against the scuffed concrete floor of the shed. The surface felt cool beneath my fingertips, an unusual chill radiating from the door, contrasting sharply with the warmth of the air around me.\n\nDriven by unrelenting curiosity, I pushed the mower aside, my hands trembling with anticipation. I looked for any means of access. With a tentative grip, I found the shallow groove running along one edge. I pressed my fingers deeper and pulled with determination. The door resisted at first, creaking in protest before slowly giving way. I felt a rush of adrenaline as the aged wood began to lift, releasing an echo that reverberated through the stillness of the shed.\n\nAs the trapdoor swung open, the air around me shifted, revealing a dark chasm that seemed to absorb the dim light filtering in from the shed. As I leaned closer for a better look, my shoulder brushed against a rake, sending it crashing into its companions in a chaotic clatter. I froze, panic gripping me as I tried to make sense of the noise I had unleashed. Through a nearby window, I caught a glimpse of Jack pacing outside, his silhouette cutting through the night like a prowling predator. His eyes searched the dark yard, sharp and scrutinizing, a threat that sent prickles of dread racing along my spine. “Stay calm,” I whispered to myself, each breath tight in my chest.\n\nDucking behind the wall, I held my breath as the darkness closed in around me, an engulfing cloak of fears and potential disaster. My heartbeat thrummed loudly in my ears, drowning out the sounds of the outside world as I strained to hear Jack's movements. Every second felt stretched, the very fabric of the moment weighed down by dread.\n\nFinally, when Jack turned away, my lungs exploded with relief. I exhaled, the rush of air escaping as a whispered prayer of gratitude, contemplating my next move. The trapdoor yawned open before me, a maw of potential secrets and peril. I could easily pull the door closed, retreat into my safe bubble, but the dread of not knowing what lay beneath gnawed insistently in the pit of my stomach.\n\nI gathered my courage and descended into the abyss. Darkness enveloped me tightly as I found a creaking ladder, each step a reminder of the perilous choices I was making. The only sound was water dripping—a steady, menacing rhythm.\n\nAs my feet met the bottom, the air changed; it felt damp and heavy. I shone my flashlight around, illuminating the jagged cave walls adorned with something dark and grotesque—a trail of what looked like blood. And then came those sounds—groans and muffled whimpers resonating through the tunnels, twisting into something primal and unsettling.\n\nI pressed forward, my heart pounding against my ribcage like a caged animal. Just then, the whimpering escalated abruptly, sharp and terrifying. I turned a corner, compelled to move towards the sound, the echoes of despair pulling me in.\n\nAs I ventured deeper into the shadows, my flashlight unveiled chains that were rusted and tangled, their metallic surfaces glinting ominously against the dark stone walls. An unsettling tension coiled around me, almost sentient, as I rounded the corner and confronted the source of the desperate cries.\n\nIn the heart of the cavern, a solitary chair loomed in the shadows, and in it sat Lily—completely exposed and shackled by chains. Her skin was ghostly pale, a stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her, and she appeared fragile and utterly defenseless. A wave of dread washed over me as I realized the horror that Jack had inflicted upon her.\n\n“Lily!” My voice faltered, barely disrupting the oppressive silence as I rushed toward her, an instinctive drive surging within me to save her. But as I approached, her gaze met mine—a haunting mixture of fear and startling clarity that sent an icy shiver down my spine.\n\nHorror etched across her face, she moved her lips but no sound emerged. “Leave!” she finally managed to whisper, the urgency in her tone barely audible. Confusion washed over me as I shook my head.\n\n“What? No, I’m here to save you!” I insisted, desperately tugging at the chains that bound her. Sweat beaded on my forehead, melding with the gnawing dread that tightened my throat.\n\nI examined the chains more closely, trying to find a weak point. They were heavy and thick, but I was determined to free Lily. I searched for a key or a mechanism to release the locks, but there was nothing. I would have to use brute force.\n\nI gripped the chains tightly and pulled with all my might. The metal creaked and groaned, but it didn't budge. I tried again, using every ounce of strength I had. Slowly but surely, the chains began to loosen.\n\nThe creature moved closer, its presence suffocating. Lily's eyes locked onto mine, filled with a desperate pleading. \"You don't understand, Tommy. I have to feed it.\"\n\nI recoiled at her words, grappling with disbelief. \"What do you mean, feed it? You're not a part of this nightmare!\"\n\nLily's voice strained against the weight of the chains. \"It's only getting hungrier. I'm its source of food, and if I don't give it what it craves, it'll consume us both.\"\n\nThe air grew thick with dread as I fought to swallow my panic. \"No! I won't let this happen! We can fight this together!\" But Lily's words were like a cold wind blowing through my soul.\n\n\"Tommy, listen,\" she whispered. \"You need to leave before it takes you instead. Tommy... it's coming back.\"\n\nI gritted my teeth and pulled harder, the chains finally giving way with a loud clang. Lily's arms fell free, and she collapsed forward, her body trembling with exhaustion. But as I turned to help her up, a figure emerged from the shadows. She was another girl, younger and more fragile than Lily. Her eyes were sunken and her skin was deathly pale. She had been forced to eat human meat by Jack. The girl's eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a chill run down my spine. She was a monster now. The air grew thick with dread as I fought to swallow my panic. \"No! We can't let this happen!\" I whispered to Lily. She nodded weakly, her eyes filling with tears. I grabbed Lily's hand and pulled her up, trying to keep her close as we backed away from the monster. But it was too late. The girl's eyes lit up with hunger, and she began to move towards us.\n\n\"No!\" Lily screamed, pulling on my hand in desperation. \"Tommy, we have to get out of here!\"\n\nI didn't need to be told twice. I pulled Lily close and turned to run, but my legs felt heavy and unresponsive. The monster was closing in on us fast. We moved as fast as possible, running through the labyrinth of the cave. Finally, both of our eyes fixed on the ladder that led up to the hatch. We climbed as fast as we could, our legs aching from the exertion. I could hear the monster's footsteps behind us, its heavy breathing echoing off the walls of the cave. As we reached the top of the ladder, I pushed open the hatch and peered out into the bright sunlight. The air was warm and fresh, a welcome respite from the dank, musty smell of the shed.\n\nAs we emerged from the shed, Lily and I didn't stop running until we reached the safety of my house, just across the street. I grabbed Lily's hand and pulled her along, not daring to look back in case the monster or Jack was following us. We crossed the street, our footsteps echoing off the pavement. The houses seemed to loom over us, their windows like empty eyes staring back.\n\nAs we reached my front door, I fumbled for the key and jammed it into the lock. The door creaked open, and I pulled Lily inside, slamming it shut behind us. We stood there for a moment, catching our breath and trying to process what had just happened. I could feel Lily's trembling body against mine, her eyes wide with fear. I led her to the living room, where we collapsed onto the couch, exhausted. Lily's eyes were sunken, her skin pale, and her hair was tangled and matted. She looked like a shell of the girl she used to be. I pulled a blanket around her shoulders and held her close, trying to comfort her.\n\n\"We're safe now,\" I whispered. \"We're safe.\" But Lily's eyes were distant, her mind still trapped in the nightmare of the shed. She didn't respond, just lay there in silence. I stood from the couch. “Lily, we have to call the police,” I said. Without saying anything, she just nodded.\n\nI reached for the phone on the coffee table and dialed 911. \"Hello, emergency services,\" a voice answered on the other end. I took a deep breath before speaking. \"There's been a kidnapping and possibly multiple murders. The man who did this is at his house right now. Please send someone as soon as possible.\" I hung up the phone and turned back to Lily. She was still sitting on the couch, her eyes fixed on some point in the distance. I joined her again.\n\nWe both looked out the living room window, staring at Jack’s house and shed, waiting for the police to arrive.\n\nAs the police cars screeched to a halt in front of Jack's house, Jack himself emerged from the shadows, a mixture of surprise and defiance on his face. He was still dressed in the same worn-out clothes he had worn when he put Lily in the shed. A tall and imposing officer with a stern expression stepped out of the lead car and approached Jack.\n\n\"Jack, you're under arrest for the kidnapping and torture of Lily and several other victims,\" he said, his voice firm and authoritative.\n\nJack's eyes narrowed, and he took a step back, as if trying to create distance between himself and the officer. \"What are you talking about?\" he sneered. \"I've done nothing wrong.\" As the officer moved to cuff Jack, Jack struggled against him, trying to break free. But it was no use—he was quickly overpowered by the officer and two other officers who had arrived on the scene.\n\nAs they led him away in handcuffs, Jack's eyes locked onto me and Lily. For a moment, Jack's gaze held a spark of hatred, but then his expression turned cold and calculating.\n\nWe couldn't see what was happening in the shed clearly, but Lily and I watched three new police officers approach the shed and carefully lift the woman who had been transformed into a monster from the ground. She was still on her knees, her eyes glazed over and her body trembling with the effects of a tranquilizer they must have used.\n\nOne officer took charge of the situation. \"Okay, let's get her out of here and get her to a hospital,\" he said to his partner.\n\nThe three officers carefully lifted the woman's arms and legs, trying not to jostle her too much as they carried her out of the shed. They moved slowly and deliberately, taking care not to make any sudden movements that might cause her to thrash about or become even more agitated.\n\nAs they emerged from the shed, the officers could see that the woman's condition was even more dire than they had initially thought. Her skin was pale and clammy, and her eyes were sunken and unfocused. She was still muttering incoherently to herself, and her movements were slow and stiff.\n\nThe officers carefully placed the woman on a stretcher that had been brought over by the ambulance crew. They covered her with a blanket to keep her warm, and then began to make their way back to the ambulance.\n\nJack ended up being charged with multiple counts of kidnapping, torture, and assault, and that he would likely spend the rest of his life behind bars. The woman, meanwhile, was rushed to a hospital where she could receive medical attention. The doctors and nurses worked quickly to stabilize her condition, but it was clear that she would need extensive treatment to recover from the trauma she had suffered.\n\nWe watched from the window as the ambulance drove away, feeling a mix of relief and sadness. The ordeal was finally over, but we knew that we could never forget the horror that happened in the shed across the street."},"701":{"title":"Three videos from New Mexico, Houston and above of the ocean, Clear video footage of a UFO.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f63ne1\/three_videos_from_new_mexico_houston_and_above_of\/","flair":"Video","author":"forhealthy","selftext":"Interesting UFO video scenes from different places, watch them and tell me what you think.\n\nVery clear video footage of a UFO in the sky of New Mexico, It looks like a rescue mission.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZDc2Pc46J60](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZDc2Pc46J60)\n\nClear video footage of a UFO, Filmed in the sky of Houston.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MsmeRKXi-Y0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MsmeRKXi-Y0)\n\nVideo footage of a UFO battalion, many mysterious lights above of the ocean.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dwBDUYl-Iig](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dwBDUYl-Iig)"},"702":{"title":"Looking for a specific story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f5rc7j\/looking_for_a_specific_story\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"itchy-pterosaur","selftext":"My boyfriend is going crazy trying to remember the name of a creepypasta that’s narrated on YouTube\n\nIt’s the one about the couple that dies and wakes up in a basement in their own little purgatory and the devil tells the guy that he has to fight his way through this hellscape of a property if he wants to give his wife back her life.

Asking everyone to kill themselves is pretty harsh. I don’t say that lightly in any way though, I promise. It’s for good reason, because if you don’t do it now you may never have the chance later. \n\nI went into bio-engineering for the sole purpose of helping to better the world. If there was some way that we could create sustainable agriculture in any weather, more bountiful crops, or hell, even a substitute for meat farming, I would be happy with my accomplishments. Unfortunately, I was young and naive when I thought all that, before I was hired for the job that probably damned us all.\n\nIt was honestly too good to pass up thanks to all the loans I had from grad school. Military contractors in the biomedicine field, said when they hired me on that they would cover my full tuition loan paid back after one year on the job. If you’ve paid for graduate school, you know that’s one hell of a deal, especially if the company is also paying a six-figure salary on the higher end, with major clearance requirements. I’m not a dumbass, I know it was either that or back behind the goddamn gas station counter scanning cat food and condoms for idiots that shouldn’t reproduce in the first place. Oh Jesus Christ, every realization I have just makes everything worse.\n\nSo, government contractor, right? We worked in a surprisingly normal spot in the American Midwest, a pretty big skyscraper that housed the rest of the firm’s businesses. Ours was deep underground though, highly secure thanks to the nature of our work. I won’t lie, when I stepped in I was super worried I had signed up to work for the fucking Umbrella Corporation. Honestly, it would probably be better to have a zombie apocalypse than this unending nightmare we’re about to experience.\n\nShort rundown- I was an associate researcher on this project, as well as the lead on lab tests. They were looking for the miracle drug, something that had a one hundred percent cure rate for anything from cancer to dementia to the common cold. I was in, absolutely behind the goal of the project from the start. Meanwhile, our head scientist, an older woman named Deb, was incredibly stony about everything. Nothing seemed good enough for her, there was no excitement when we hit breakthroughs, just a constant “we need more progress” type attitude. We couldn’t please her, even with cutting-edge science.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam was another associate, her specialty being in genetic engineering. Colton rounded out the team, presiding over specimens, records, and administering samples. It was a small team to try and minimize leaks, because we were going to change the world.\n\nIt’s been five years since then, and we’ve gone through a hell of a lot of attempts. Splicing together DNA to try to create a cure-all isn’t easy, and I’m not about to get into the specifics of it because it’s not fucking important right now.\n\nAs with any drug trials, we had to start testing on animals. Look, my ethics weren’t for it either, but we started with the standard lab rats before moving on to primates. The lab rats had shown good promise finally, with most diseases infected cured within a few weeks with a round of the drugs. Even the cancer started going away, cells repairing themselves from the decay. Primate trials went much the same, with the apes even having a more energizing effect that made them recover even faster. It was all going so, so right for everything we were working towards. We should have seen the signs once we started human trials.\n\nWe didn’t take volunteers, but instead were given “executed” death row prisoners. Some we were kind of lucky about, thanks to either the time it takes the American justice system to do a damn thing or just due to their own genetic predispositions, some subjects already had sicknesses to test on. Cancer, one with Alzheimer’s, and even a poor soul with unchecked syphilis that was running wild. We had our work cut out for us.\n\nIt was like a damned miracle when we started the treatments, giving them a fourteen-day course of injections meant to heal them on a genetic level. It was administered straight to the spinal column, spreading through the nervous system. What we saw as the results were amazing. The cancer patient was better by the fifth day, the tumor-shrinking down to nonexistence in his brain. Unfortunately, when it finally shrunk he seemed to have an utter breakdown of what he had done, murdering his family and neighbors to land on death row. I felt bad for him, in a way, because the guy was just screaming pure rage and grief over the death of his kids and wife. That’s when he tried killing himself in his cell, running his head into the wall constantly.\n\nGuards were able to intervene, getting to him before he could do any lasting harm to himself. Recovery for him was normal, though he did have a slight concussion. The treatment continued, with the concussion fading in a few days. The subject was kept on a full psych lockdown for the remainder of the test while he received psychological counseling. Eventually, though they took his request with a very reluctant and honestly uncaring attitude, it was approved. He would continue helping us with the test until the trial was completed, and then he would be allowed to choose execution if he wanted. The guy was distraught, obviously haunted by what he had done. \n\nOther test subjects were proceeding a lot the same, though one began to completely break down after a short time. According to him we were injecting him with babies’ blood, unlocking his satanic powers. Didn’t feel bad for him considering he was “executed” for the massive amount of things found on hard drives in his house. \n\nWhile administering tests and treatments we worked in pairs. If there was a subject in the room, there was always one of us paired with one of the two guards who worked down here with us. It was me on duty for treatments that day, and the subject was being relatively quiet for the most part. We went in with no issue, the subject was cuffed by the guard and I set up to administer the drug. Before I knew what was going on he started ranting again, saying he was going to take down the cabal and help Christ reign, the typical terrorist bullshit these days. Except this time he didn’t keep to ranting, instead leaning over and sinking his teeth into my arm. \n\nHe wouldn’t let go either, no matter how much the guard tried pulling his jaw open or I knocked him in the head. Eventually, he started drawing blood through my scrubs and coat, so the guard took his last resort. Drawing his pistol, he leveled it at the subject’s forehead, moving me aside and pulling the trigger. I felt his grip on my arm loosen almost instantly as the gunshot ran through, spattering gray matter on the wall behind us. The others came running within moments, seeing the steady pooling of blood on the floor. The subject was terminated, a complete fucking waste of a trial. Can’t say he didn’t deserve it, but he could have followed through on the one good thing he did in his life and finished the tests.\n\nImagine our surprise when we went to pick him up and take him to the incinerator and he still had a pulse. Even with all the blood and guts scattered in the room, he was fucking breathing. That changed everything, because we realized we might be able to finish the trial after all. We threw him on a stretcher and brought him to the lab, using whatever we had to staunch the bleeding and set up a vitals monitor. Looking back it’s obvious why he survived, but we still didn’t know at the time. \n\nHe stayed alive, though in a vegetative state. X-rays showed that most of his brain was scrambled by the bullet, with the guy only able to drool and moan if he really put his remaining mind to it. Meanwhile, the syphilis that had been running rampant in him was gone, complete recovery other than what was included in his lost brain matter.\n\nThen came the final sign thanks to one of the primate subjects. We were still watching them for long-term effects, making sure that it wouldn’t trigger a Planet of the Apes scenario or anything. One day the two got into a fight over food, though it happened overnight so none of us saw it until the next day on camera footage. Instead, what met us when we entered the lab was the ape enclosure soaked in blood, one of the subjects lying in the dirt totally disemboweled, yet still trying to crawl toward the glass. \n\nIt shocked us. This thing had guts hanging from where its stomach was, just dropping out like a fucking pinata. We took him to the lab, and did what amounted to a full workup to see what the hell was going on. Half of its organs were eaten by the other ape in an act of dominance. Even still, this thing continued to live, still exhibiting brain waves and a pulse. It was fully aware of what was happening around it, though the pain caused it to scream when we weren’t pumping it with morphine.\n\nWe realized after a few days that something bad was happening. The ape still wasn’t dead, but the wounds it had were just scabbing over, still brutally deadly but only causing immense pain instead of expiration. After taking samples, we realized the DNA of the creature was structured differently than before. The treatment seemed to have turned off the ability to die.\n\nOf course, once we saw this in the ape subjects we confirmed it on the human subjects as well. The gunshot wound subject was still going, with pulse and limited brain waves active. He’s sentient, and able to understand basic commands, as well as make sounds with great effort. We decided to give him a test under the guise of mercy.\n\nHe was given a rudimentary order- blink twice if you want to die, once for no. As soon as he blinked twice, Deb injected him with a nerve agent that would cause total death within five minutes. After a about two minutes he began to seize, body erratically jerking around the bed he was on. His mouth began foaming, loud moans of despair coming out as his eyes rolled back in his head. His pulse dropped but never flatlined, with brain activity still going the entire way through. Even after a second dose of the nerve agent, he only suffered immense pain, but was unable to die in a conventional form.\n\nI took it upon myself, to be honest with the other subject, the one who promised an execution for his sins and service. He was distraught, of course, but went quiet after a few moments. We left him be, or at least attempted to, but before the guard in the room could react, the subject stole the gun straight from his holster.\n\nHolding the gun to his temple, the subject flipped the safety off and pulled the trigger, splattering more gore on the freshly painted wall. A look of horror filled his eyes before he started screaming, the pain of what he had done settling in. The gun never left his temple, and he pulled the trigger three more times before falling to the ground. He just lay there twitching, blood pouring from every hole on his face as his brains swirled inside with the lead. \n\nWe set him up in the lab, pulse still faintly going and brain waves still giving off from what was left of his skull. In the process of checking him out, we went ahead and did scans on the other subject. Another shock ran through all of us- his brain was reforming, matter forming and splitting off from his other cells like a reverse cancer. Things became bleak after a few days, with the realization that it would only restore the parts involving life functions. They would have a pulse consciousness, full awareness of everything at every second, confirmed by asking the subject questions and receiving answers, but they could not die. \n\nIt became too much. We almost felt like we owed it to these people to kill them after trying so hard to make a cure. There was one option we had left though, and it was worth a shot. The incinerator.\n\nI can still smell his flesh and hear his screams. We put the conspiracy subject in first, thinking it would probably be a little easier on us considering his past. When we set it off, the screams started immediately, the sounds of his limbs thrashing as nerves were burned off at the ends. We were waiting for the screaming to stop. Waiting for him to finally fucking die. The screaming kept going. None of us knew what to do. At some point, he must have finally lost consciousness or just become numb to the pain, but it took hours. When he finally stopped, we gave it a few minutes before shutting the flames off, pulling the cremation tray out with our fingers crossed that it worked.\n\nHis charred, blackened body was lying on the tray, twitching every so often. He let out a rasping breath, crispy vocal cords sounding like sandpaper. His pulse still beating, brain activity was still at full capacity, and even with his brain almost melting to the point of soup in his brain, he was still conscious.\n\nI think we found a way to actually bond the human soul to a genetic code, leaving us trapped in these meat bags through the treatment. We tried other ways, even decapitation as a full-on last resort. A severed, burned head was still giving off brain waves, even after all of that. Any amount of pain could happen to the body, any amount of restriction and injury inflicted, but the soul of the person would stay, brain activity never ceasing. They were trapped in their own head, quite literally, even if the rest of them were destroyed.\n\nI couldn’t deal with what we had wrought. The realization that saving lives had gone into unethical territory like this, with us damning a human to eternal life? Our only hope to die now was old age, and it didn’t look like that was going to happen at this rate either. I finally broke down last week in the lab, seeing the near vegetative body of the cancer patient and the still severed, gawking head of the other. A scalpel was on the table next to me, and I decided it was enough. When I went home that night, I made up my mind.\n\nI knew my anatomy, but went into the bathroom to use the mirror just to make sure I was accurate. The scalpel stung as it first cut into my neck, making my hand recoil, but I had to follow through. I swiped it across quickly, slitting my jugular vein and pouring blood into the sink. I didn’t realize how much blood I had in me until I saw it on the counter, almost overflowing the sink before the drain could take it all. I choked, unable to breathe as my throat was more concerned with the vein that was slit. My breath caught, bleeding everywhere, the last thing I remembered was falling back into unconsciousness, though it wasn’t a complete blackout. I kept having waking nightmares, on the floor in a sea of my own blood, unable to move as I lay facedown, iron taste on my tongue. By the time I was able to get up, the cut had closed up, healing like a normal wound would. It was three days from when I tried, and all I got was waking up in a pool of my own coagulating blood.\n\nI don’t know if we flew too close to the sun or maybe we were part of the experiment. At this time I believe the strain that caused the loss of death may have gone airborne in the lab, bypassing the injectible treatment method.\n\nI’m giving you this warning so you can do what I can’t. It’s only a matter of time until this is everywhere, considering we’ve been free to go in and out of the lab as we please.

The sound rang in his ears, already sending a jolt of agitation to his psyche. \"Damn-damn-damn-Damnit!\" The man spat with frustration as he threw his fist down on the snooze button of the alarm clock. I-I-I hate that damn thing!\" He sat up, bare feet hitting countless empty beer cans on the dirty floor. This specific individual went by the name of Billy Boltz. A full time Mason for a local bricklaying and stone restoration company in the backwoods town of Buck Barren Hills. A heavy set individual with a large belly, gray hair that always stood up in random patches. He walked with a limp part time due to the occasional case of gout that infected his right foot. He chain smoked menthol cigarettes that left him with a disgusting cough that sometimes turned into an even more grotesque gagging fit. He spoke with a gravelly tone that was plagued by a ridiculous stutter. This particular morning marked his thirty fifth year in the trade. \n\nAs Billy stretched with his hands towards the ceiling, an aroma of sulfur crept into his nostrils. He looked to his left, noticing a faint glow of fire on his dresser. A small ring appeared with tendrils of smoke rising from it. Small black legs rose from the ring, followed by beady red eyes attached to an oblong body made of brownish gray matter. Black spots speckled the dingy colored sections of its body. The insect in question was a rather large Lantern Fly. It spun around and focused its eyes at the man and spoke in a voice that resembled what you would expect an elderly Cajun Fellow to sound like. \"Good morning, Billy boy.\" It skittered its tiny legs back and forth in a rocking motion. Periodically flapping its wings to reveal an underbelly of white and red. Billy rolled his eyes and replied. \"An-an-and good mo-mor-morning to you too Wilhelm.\" Billy sat back down to nurse the throbbing in his big toe. He examined it, noticing a gleam of pus beginning to ooze from the skin near the nail. The creature flapped its wings again and shouted gleefully. \"Breakfast!!\" \n\nThe Lantern Fly flew in haste towards Billy, landing on the infected toe. A long green proboscis ejected from the insects mouth and began slurping up the disgusting fluid. This Lantern Fly hailed from an insectoid dimension from the northern atmosphere of the eleventh circle of Hell. It's name was Wilhelm Oderus Abernathy the fifth. A distant cousin to the infamous Beelzebub, lord of the flies. Billy had accidentally summoned this creature when he was a young boy. He and a friend picked on a quiet little girl who later claimed to put a Ruwet on them. A Ruwet is a crudely manufactured type of hex, created from the combination of New Orleans Voodoo and back country superstition. This was a common thing in the wooded atmosphere of Buck Barren Hills. Southern paranoia blended with Creo curses and a dash of hillbilly mysticism. The specific region in which Billy grew up was chalk full of things associated with the dark arts and flawed pseudo sciences. The further north you went, the less common such practices and beliefs would be. However later through the years, these types of beliefs And rituals eventually faded away.\n\nWhen the little girl muttered a cryptic phrase and left a stray doll in the form of Billy and his friend, he panicked and sought a way to expel the Ruwet. His grandmother was part Haitian and was known for her dabbling in the old ways. So he raided her room and found an old book. He skimmed the pages until he found a section involving protection. He followed the instructions to the letter. Cutting hair from his and his friends scalp, swallowing a leech whole, burning sage with the accompanying cats eyes. The last item came from a stray that had been hanging around his farm. Add these to the removal of exactly seven drops of blood and a tooth, the ritual had begun. Soon a small ring of fire formed, smoke billowing to reveal the demonic insect. To make a long story short, the Ruwet was lifted but at the cost of the little girl's life. Her body was never found. Only Billy and Wilhelm know the location of the poor girl's body. Her death was administered by Billy alone with the influence of the demonic Lantern fly. From that day on, Wilhelm would drop by to check on Billy. Offerings of spoiled meat and bodily fluids were demanded to keep the beast at bay. This went on for decades and Billy did his best to keep the creature pleased. Unfortunately he did not read the fine print of the page. It stated that the protection lasted for life, leaving the caster in perpetual debt. There was also a miscommunication between what Billy read and what was on the aged paper. However, Wilhelm destroyed the page and caused Ol’ Granny Boltz's heart to give out. So he would never truly know exactly what he had done that day. All he knew was that he had a hellspawn that would never leave him. The question of whether or not the process of ridding himself of the Ruwet was worth it also remained with him.\n\nAfter the pus was completely sucked from the infected toe, Wilhelm flew off and Billy began to get dressed. Clothes on and boots tied, he stepped outside and lit a cigarette. He coughed, gagged and threw up a little in his mouth. By this time, Wilhelm had disappeared out of sight, back to the realms of Hell no doubt. Billy wondered what the bug did when it was not on earth as he tended to the chickens and cows before getting into his rusty old pickup and heading to the current jobsite.\n\nThere are very few large buildings in Buck Barren Hills and most houses are composed of wood. But further down the region in Thistle Valley, one can see brick homes and a few grand structures. That was where business took place for the company that employed Billy. Majority of the jobs involved cutting and re-pointing the joints of brick buildings or chimneys of homes, cleaning decades worth of grime via chemicals and caulking windows. Every so often a larger job would need demolition in order to remove and replace damaged sections of structures. That was exactly the process for the contracting operation Billy was currently headed to. He was the foreman on the site with four journeymen and one laborer. The building was an elementary school composed of tan brick that was cracking in certain areas. Some sections had even crumbled from wear and tear. The contract was to replace the fallen and cracked brick and repoint specific joints. Spot pointing to be exact. Scaffolding structures surrounded the affected areas. There was also an extra process of cleaning old carbon stains from one wall. This required the use of a chemical called 766 masonry rewash solution, a thick mucus-like material made to eat away at anything not native to stone. The cleaner itself is very toxic and can eat away flesh which requires heavy duty rubber gloves, safety glasses and rain gear to avoid any injury. It was to be applied, washed then washed away with the use of a pressure washing machine.\n\nTwo men worked on the brick while the other two focused on the cleaning. The laborer was there to mix mortar, stock brick and man the two pulley systems on the scaffolding. Using those apparatuses to send buckets of debris and such up or down to the men above. All the while, Billy sat in his truck, chain smoking and barking orders. Everyone there hated this but preferred that over him showing up to examine them. Billy had a major anger problem that led to screaming and tools flying through the air. To say people dispised working for him was an understatement. \n\nThe day went as usual with Billy showing up at six thirty. Eventually everyone else began to arrive. The first two members of the crew showed up at the same time, six forty five. Then another with the laborer showing up not far behind. Then finally at five minutes past seven, the last member made his obnoxious appearance. An ugly lifted truck blaring David Alan Coe through the speakers. This journeyman was the most problematic. He was always late and it drove Billy nuts. He would yell at the man constantly for his tardiness but to no avail. He even tried getting the man fired but that didn't work either because this particular individual was the nephew of the owner of the company.\n\nThe men stood around Billy's truck, removing their tool bags from their vehicles before receiving the daily greeting from their boss. \"Good Friday gentlemen. An-an-an-and how are we this mo-mor-mornin'?\" Each gave their response then asked how he was. This was followed by one of Billy's many odd phrases. \"Fair-fair-fair to midland, lads. Fair to midland.\" After the cordial niceties finished it was time for work. Angle grinders wiring, sending clouds of dust to fly through the air. The smell of chemicals that were applied to the stained brick on the south wall of the building. And on the ground near a mixing trough was the laborer. Combining dry components to water, scraping and mixing the concoction with a hoe. Back and forth until the mixture settled. This is when Billy would yell at the young man. \"Two-two-two to one, kid!\" He was referring to the formula of two parts sand and one part mortar powder in order to create the ideal texture to be used in laying the new brick.\n\nBilly also had issues with the laborer. It seemed like the laborer was always making mistakes that muddled with the production of work. Incorrect measurements of mortar, applying too much or too little water. Looking at his phone when work needed to be done. And there was the time when the young man was cleaning the second frame of scaffolding and accidently knocked over a full bucket of debris. It fell and sent chunks of broken brick tumbling towards Billy's truck. A few dents and a crack in the windshield ended up sending him into a wild frenzy. Screaming, cussing and he almost climbed up and fought the laborer. So needless to say this person was on Billy's constant radar. There were issues with pretty much everyone on the job. But then again, Billy had problems with everyone he encountered. That also applied to those who worked under his iron fist of slavery. The whole crew despised him but dealt with the bastard strictly for the money.\n\nThe day ended with little incident and Billy only had to yell four times which was a low amount for him. He sped off and drove back to his dilapidated home to load his truck up for the weekend. He had a cabin up towards Cedar Mountain that was used for fishing and it also housed the remains of a few individuals he had sacrificed for Wilhelm in his early years. The creatures appetite fluctuated with time. Most offerings came in the form of Billy's bodily fluids and entrails from any animal that met their end through the man's hunting trips. But there had been some occasions where human remains were demanded. Billy fought the request but Wilhelm's grip on him was too strong. Although to the human eye, the creature appeared to be only the size of a thumb. Behind the veil of camouflage, a behemoth of enormous proportions made up the existence of the demonic insect. It's intangible talons were capable of digging deep into Billy's mind if he disobeyed. The pain was excruciating and left him with no choice but to listen and do as he was instructed. It was rare for this to happen but when it did, it was shown who held the reins to Billy's existence. This is why at the furthest end of the cabin sat a small graveyard. Unnoticeable to most but Billy was constantly reminded of the bodies that lay in their eternal beds beneath the land he owned. It sickened him and he prayed to God for help but Wilhelm would laugh. “There's no God here to help you, Billy boy.”\n\nBilly spent that weekend fishing for large mouth bass and a few blue gill. The guts and egg sacs were set aside in a ceramic jar. After the weekend ended, he headed back home. After unloading his things, he walked to a dark corner in his bedroom with the ceramic jar in hand. He lit three candles on a small table. It was decorated with various bone fragments, small glass bottles of dark liquids, dried herbs and etched into the wood was a symbol. One associated with Wilhelm, three circles connected by various acute angles. Billy set the jar down and removed the lid. The candles' flames grew and turned green. A whining noise caused the floor to vibrate under his feet and smoke rose from the table. A small circle of fire erupted and out popped the Lantern fly. It shifted its beady eyes between Billy and the jar full of entrails. \"My my my. What a feast?\" Wilhelm twitched a thin leg that landed on the jar. Billy nervously scratched at the stuble on his chin. \"There's your uh-uh-uh offerin' for this-this season.\" Fear and hope nestled inside those words of the man. Fear of the demon and hope that the offering would suffice for a long while. Wilhelm fluttered its wings, performing a hopping motion to land on the ceramic lid. The long proboscis emerged, growing to the size of an earthworm. The end opened up to reveal jagged yellow fangs that stabbed at the putrid smelling fish organs. The creature slurped and moaned with delight. Black dots shifted in circular motions through the powder material of brown and gray wings. In a matter of minutes, the entire jar was empty. Afterwards, Wilhelm brought its attention back to Billy. \"'Tis a fine meal. But only time will tell if I crave more sustenance for this season, lad.\" A high pitched buzz filled the room and in a flash of ominous light, Wilhelm disappeared through a cloud of smoke.\n\nThe next week started off with no incidents or complications. Brick was beginning to be replaced and the cleaning on the other section of the building was nearly finished. Billy only had to yell three times over the course of Monday and Tuesday. Things took a different turn on Wednesday morning. He woke up with a hangover but that was usual. The unusual part was the lack of noises coming from the chicken coop. Normally the rooster would be crowing and the hens clucking behind the latched door. Billy walked up to the small enclosure to silence. He unhooked the lock and opened up to a horrid scene of blood and feathers. All the poultry had been ripped apart. Crimson stains had been splashed on the walls, the hay was drenched in fluid, organs and excrement. Every chicken had been slaughtered. Torn open carcasses and their heads ripped from their necks. Billy choked on his own vomit from the scene and all of the sudden a buzzing rang in his ears. A low humming tune echoed within the coop. Standing on top of the mutilated body of the rooster was Wilhelm. His green monstrous appendage was chomping down on the remnants of a neckbone. \"Billy boy! Apologies for the mess but I just had an outstanding craving this morning. I hope you don't mind. Don't worry, give me a few hours and these feeble bodies will be gone.\" The insect fluttered its wings as it spoke.\n\nBilly stammered over his words which made the stutter he was cursed with even more apparent. \"Wh-wh-wh-what did you-you-you do?! My-my-my\" Wilhelm cut him off mid sentence. \"Hush now old chap. I had a hunger that needed to be satisfied. You were sleeping so peacefully and I thought not to wake you. Now run along, you'll be late for work.\" Billy backed away and jumped with fright when one of the slain hens legs jerked. He turned and ran. A sharp shooting pain radiated in his foot, a sure sign the gout was about to kick in. He didn't have time to nurse the foot so he hopped in his truck and rushed to work. The events of the morning had him shook but there was nothing to be done so he prayed that work would keep him distracted.\n\nBilly arrived at the job site a little later than usual but still made it before everyone else. He sat in his truck, smoking a cigarette. He rolled it back and forth between his fingers as the images of his desecrated livestock flooded his mind's eye. The throbbing in his foot intensified. He jumped when one of the journeymen approached his truck to greet him. They could see something was wrong but didn't bother inquiring about the man's odd behavior. Work began and everyone was surprised that Billy wasn't barking orders or yelling at the laborer. He couldn't be bothered with those things, his mind was still back in the chicken coop. The smell of sulfar filled the cab of the truck and a small flame erupted on the dashboard. Billy choked on cigarette smoke when he watched Wilhelm leap out of the fire. \"My dear Billy! How art thou? I want you to know the mess back home is all clean. I even lapped up the blood off the walls for you.\" The insect rubbed a black thin arm across those hellish eyes. It walked towards the steering wheel in a jerky, robotic motion. Billy ripped his hands from the wheel in order to avoid contact. \"What ar-ar-are you do-do-doin’ here?\" Billy was confused. Wilhelm had never appeared when he was at work and the damn thing had eaten a whole flock of chickens. There was absolutely no reason for the demonic bug to be there. Willhelm rested on the center of the steering wheel and stared for a while. \"Well my boy, you see, that hunger of mine is still ravenous. Unfortunately the poultry was but a mere snack. I believe it's time for something more substantial. After all, it has been over a decade.\" Billy knew all too well what this meant. The last time this happened, he was tasked with burying two bodies on the lot of his cabin. \"I-I-I can't do that here.\" Billy's heart thumped hard in his chest. The insect cleaned itself and stretched out one wing then folded it. \"You will give me what I want Billy boy. You always do.\" This was true, the last time Billy tried to deny Wilhelm, it did not end so well. The hold this creature had on the man was immeasurable.\n\n\"What do-do-do you want?\" The worry of acting out another case of gruesome murder began to weigh heavy on Billy. He wanted to disappear and be free of Wilhelm’s grasp but knew that was impossible. The chipper Lantern fly hopped up and glided on spotted wings to land on the man's shoulder. \"For starters, I would rather enjoy a fresh and plump set of occular organs. Perhaps the tall one would suffice.\" The tall one as Wilhelm described was the journeyman who always gave Billy a hard time. He had always wanted to tussle with the man but the thought of murder never crossed his mind. Billy didn't argue and like an obedient pet, he exited the truck and walked towards the scaffolding. After a treacherous climb of forty feet, he made it to the deck where two men were laying brick. One was using a chipping hammer to pop out some of the leftover mortar joints while the other was scooping and placing new wet mortar with a trowel. As Billy approached, the tall one was placing a half broken brick in the wall. \"How-how-hows it goin lads?\" He asked the men, hiding his solemn knowledge of what was about to happen. The one using the power tool didn't react on account of him wearing headphones to block out the noise while the other asked why Billy was up there. \n\nThe conversation was made short when Wilhelm, still sitting on Billy's shoulder, hissed into his ear. \"Do it! Now!\" Billy's hand shook as he grabbed a brick hammer that was laying next to a stack of bricks. He gripped the handle and raised it over his head. The tall man was kneeling down, smoothing out the overflowing mortar between the new course of bricks. He looked over his shoulder. His eyes grew wide when he saw the tool fly towards him. It landed on the side of his head, sending a loud and wet crack that spurted blood. It spread and landed on the wall and on Billy's cheek. He ripped the hammer from the cracked skull and repeated three more times until the man's body went limp. His partner did not react and continued working. Wilhelm hopped and glided towards the corpse with a jagged hole in the battered skull. The creature moved in that unnatural motion to a pair of still open eyes. It hummed a tune and released that gigantic green organ and began to devour the lifeless orbs. Billy just stood there with the hammer still in his hand. Blood and viscera slowly dripped from one end. The man with the power tool paused what he was doing and removed one of his ear plugs. He turned to see the insect eating his partner and let out a scream. Wilhelm shouted at Billy. \"Silence that one!\" With no will to hesitate, Billy landed a blow of the hammer to the screaming man's head. A thud followed a loud bang of the power tool that fell onto the aluminum deck. The journeyman began convulsing, blood oozing from the wound. Wilhelm hopped onto Billy's shoulder then forced its way into his ear canal. Small arms dug into the flesh and worked Billy like a puppet. He placed a boot on the man's chest and leaned over to grab the chipping gun. He placed the bit on his employee’s forehead and pulled the trigger. Loud pounding resonated from the power tool, sending the long bit to hammer through flesh and into the skull. Cracking bone and liquids flew from the crude opening until the bit rammed all the way through to the other side. This was indicated by the clattering of metal against metal as the deck rattled under Billy's feet. His finger released the trigger and his legs were forced to walk up to the safety bars of the scaffolding frame. He removed them from the pins and jumped. \n\nBilly dropped like a stone to the ground but sustained no injury thanks to the hellspawn bug controlling his body. An electrifying sensation shook his eardrum and Wilhelms voice echoed. \"Off to the next two oblivious drones.\" One foot in front of the other and Billy was running towards the other side of the building. He scaled the scaffolding like some kind of crazed primate. Gripping bars and hurdling himself upwards with little effort. In a blink of an eye, he was at the top. Two men in yellow rain gear were cleaning the carbon encrusted wall. A bucket of that gooey acidic sludge was being applied with a large brush and at the far end was a pressure washing machine. Billy's presence startled the men and they jumped back. He grabbed one by the shoulders and threw him off of the deck. The poor soul fell with a hard thud to the ground, a bellowing wail of pain followed him. \"I want to see his skin melt!\" Wilhelm demanded inside of Billy's head, digging those sharp legs deeper into the flesh. The frightened journeyman started to back away, hands raised in defense. Billy's leg raised and kicked the him in the stomach. He fell on his back, air forcefully leaving his lungs. A jolt of fire charged Billy's arms to grip the bucket of chemical and dump it on the man. His face became covered in goo. The sound of agonizing cries sent bile to rise in Billy's stomach. He wanted to stop but was trapped, witnessing the horror his body was creating. No way of preventing the chaos. Small sores slowly began to rip open on the flesh of the man's face and neck. The chemical was eating away at the soft tissue, leaving countless lesions that expelled viscera. \"Let's give the man a little rinse. Shall we, Billy boy? I want to taste some cartilage. \" A sinister laugh filled the valley of audio organs inside Billy's head. His body was forced towards the pressure washer, memories of the little girl from his past flooded his mind. Gruesome still images of her disfigured body sent a trail of tears to leak from his eyes. The past was repeating itself but with a horrendous multiplication of gore. A hand set the choke while the other pulled at the drawstring. The machine roared to life, rattling in the atmosphere. Billy gripped the handle of the pressure gun and walked back to the still screaming man. He pulled the trigger, releasing a wide stream of high velocity water. It tore through the skin, rubbing it off in chunks. Blood spewed and mixed with the water, creating a pink mist. He pushed the tip closer which started to remove other pieces of tissue, all the while the victim wailed in utter agony. The tip of the gun was then placed inside of the man's mouth, filling it with water while also shredding the internal tissue of his throat. Eventually the man drowned from a mixture of water, blood and his own flesh. Wilhelm applauded his disciple. \"Well done old chap. Now rip me off a piece of his face. Do chew it for me, please.”\n\nBilly gripped a section of rigid white material that sat around the nasal cavity of the skinned face. It took some effort but eventually he was able to remove a piece. He popped it in his mouth and began to chew. It felt like stiff rubber and tasted putrid, like melted plastic and copper. His stomach turned but he continued then swallowed. “Hm. An odd taste but is much more elegant than aged fish eggs. Now let's go check on your fallen comrade.”\n\nIn another feat of amazing descent, Billy landed a few stories below. He could feel the sensation of pus explode from his infected toe. Pain pulsated in his foot but his body continued to move. The other journeyman was still alive, attempting to crawl to safety. Billy walked towards him with Wilhelm whispering diabolical things into his ears. Billy ripped the rain jacket off of him and began to stomp on the man's back. Spit flew from a screaming mouth as he tried to plead for his life. Wilhelm gazed through his slave's eyes and spotted a large metal box. The will of the insect caused Billy to pause his assault and step towards the object. He opened the lid to view various tools, wires, brushes, cords and a roll of plastic. Wilhelm spotted an angle grinder and moved Billy's blood drenched hand to grab it. The distraught drone walked back, coincidentally spotting a long yellow extension cord near the next victim. The grinder was plugged in and the button slid to the on position. The tool whirred with velocity and Billy stepped in front of the journeyman. The spinning diamond blade ate through flesh and bone like butter. Crimson fluid flew through the air, splashing all over Billy. Countless cuts were made across the body. An arm was completely severed. The blade jammed when it came in contact with the spine. Billy tried to pull it free but was forced to stop. Unbeknownst to him and Wilhelm, the laborer had witnessed the entire onslaught. The young man was standing in awe at the mixing trough, hoe still clutched in his hands. A flutter of wings tickled inside Billy's ear, followed by another command. \"Cut that little shit down!\"\n\nBilly ripped the grinder from the mutilated corpse. It began to work again, sending a large chunk of bone flying with a high pitched whistle. Heavy and fast foot falls stomped their way to the frightened man. \"Faster! Faster you pathetic fool!\" Wilhelm shouted. The speed increased but was abruptly ruined by a bucket full of debris. This sent Billy falling towards the ground, angle grinder firmly clasped in both hands. As he fell, his arms folded towards his chest. With a crash, he fell and the spinning blade dug into his neck. The momentum and speed ate through all of the muscle and bone. After landing, the blade continued its work until Billy's head held on by a thread. \"Dammit! You fumbling buffoon!\" The frustration of Wilhelm’s voice floated towards the laborer. The insect released its grip and exited from Billy's bleeding ear canal. It released its insanely large green proboscis and wrapped it around the head. As Wilhelm scurried, the head dragged across the dirt, leaving behind a trail of blood and mucus. \"By the grace of the five houses of Abernathy, you are worthless, Billy boy.\" The insect muttered to itself then started to chant in a low guttural tone. A small ring of fire and smoke appeared and Wilhelm walked while continuing its almost inaudible murmurs. The laborer fell backwards and landed in a sitting position. He stared at the sight of a talking Lantern fly dragging his bosses decapitated head towards a ring of fire. Wilhelm moved in that robotic motion and stopped to look at the young man. \"Best not stay long, lad. Someone may think you did all of this. I'll be back later to check on you.\" As the words registered in the young man's mind, he watched the bug fall through the hole, dragging Billy Boltz's severed head with him into oblivion.\n"},"710":{"title":"Help me find a Creepypasta ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f58qe1\/help_me_find_a_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Pipabethfan","selftext":"So there’s this creepypasta that I had heard from one of the lists on most amazing top 10. it was a story that was supposedly told by somebody’s grandmother about how there was a tornado bell that was supposed to warn about an incoming tornado and it would ring. the father kept sending out more of his kids, and they kept not coming back and the bell continued to ring and it was revealed that the bell only rang when the monster opened its mouth to eat.

Every child knows that. But, if no one wields the blade, a sword is just a cold piece of metal. However, those who know the qualities of a sword do not play with it, just as those who know the nature of words do not play with them. A guiding principle that I think we should remind ourselves of much more often, but don't do so. Only to regret it in the end.\n\nIt all started when I found myself in a small pub not far from my apartment after a long day at work. With my third double whiskey shortly before midnight, alone at a table in the corner, I found my inner peace night after night. By now, my visits had become the norm, almost a kind of sick tradition. This was also easy to understand because of my job. I only moved to this city a few months ago and, as it happens, I had to look for the first job I could get to pay my rent. A mechanic for wheelchairs in a small workshop in the middle of the city. Sure, helping people who can no longer walk to get from A to B again is a great job from a moral point of view. However, as is the case with morally good jobs, the pay was really shit. And I mean: “The last week of the month is forced fasting”-shit. Maybe my financial situation would be better if I didn't go to this godforsaken pub every day and down one whiskey after another. But where else would I find solace? I guess all dreams die out eventually.\n\nAs I let my gaze wander past the lost souls of this “establishment”, I noticed the girl behind the bar for the first time. Where had she been the last few nights? She must have been on vacation or something like that, I thought to myself. After all, I could already proudly call myself a “regular”. I would certainly have noticed her before. As she was talking to the other guests behind the bar, laughing and serving drinks, I caught myself watching her. Not in a strange way, but rather amazed, almost impressed, at how someone could still laugh at such a job. My father used to say: “Boy, I'll tell you one thing! Make mistakes every day and learn from them, but never fall in love with the girl behind the counter!” Kind of ironic, as my mother worked in a strip club at the time. Not as a stripper, but as a waitress. While I was thinking about his words, she looked over at me and our eyes crossed. She smiled at me, but I looked away, embarrassed.\n\n“Can I get you something else?” I looked up at her, startled, and began to stutter in shock. How had she come over to me so quickly? “N .. No thanks, I think I've had enough for today.” still stuttering . “All right, but if there's anything else, just wave me over, okay?” she smiled at me with a wink and went back behind the counter. “Don't take my word for it,” I thought to myself. “After all, it's her job to be nice to you.” Well, what can I say? One thing common sense tells you, another thing the whiskey does. And so the next few evenings I started not to sit at my familiar table in the corner, but at the front of the bar to brighten up my evenings with conversations with her. And so we got to know each other better and better. Her name was Rachel, she was about the same age as me and worked here in the pub to finance her studies, which she had started quite late. She was petite, about 5.4 foot tall, had long black hair, usually tied up in a plait and although she changed her clothes every day, she always wore this one necklace with a small blue stone as a pendant. Must be a lucky charm or something.\n\nEvenings became weeks, weeks became months. Small talk became deeptalk and deeptalk eventually turned into teasing flirting. I even caught myself being affected by her cheerful nature. I drank less and less whiskey and eventually switched to water. After all, I decided that I no longer wanted to cloud my mind in her presence. We got to know each other really good until one night at 3 a.m., just before closing time, we found ourselves alone in the pub. “Okay, enough for today. I'm not in the mood anymore.” she grumbled to herself. “Come on, I'll put on some music and we'll chill out.” She went to the stereo and put on “Country Roads” by John Denver. “Really? Country Roads?” I laughed out loud. “Yes ... the CD's in the pub don't have anything better.” she stammered to herself. “But sometimes when I'm feeling particularly melancholy, the song reminds me of home. Don't you sometimes feel like that?” In fact, I sometimes feel like her. Songs like this always make me think of the good, carefree times and what could have been. “Hey, you know what?” I burst out. “We should get away from here for a while. By that I mean really get away, get out. Apparently we both need a break from the daily grind. What do you think?” And she agreed. The very next day, we took two weeks off and set off on our road trip. I'll spare you the exact details, but we drove through a few cities, visited sights and stayed overnight in the car or at campsites. And what can I say? One thing led to another, we fell in love and became a couple.\n\nThe next few weeks passed almost at breakneck speed. I went to the pub less, as we preferred to spend the evenings at my place or at her place and talk about our everyday lives over home-cooked food and a good glass of wine. And as is the case with relationships, the negative side also came up at some point. Nothing serious, more like laundry lying around on my part or nagging about small things on her part. However, I noticed that she had this melancholy, almost depressive mood more often than I had noticed in the pub at the beginning of our dating phase. Sometimes less and sometimes more. On some days she was more cuddly than usual, put on jazz or cuddly rock and sank into her thoughts. On other days, however, it went so far that she would literally lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling for hours without saying a word or even paying attention to me or her surroundings. Fortunately, this happened quite rarely and the day after she was as good as new. She apologized in her happiest way, cooked me my favourite meal, bribed me with sex or took me on surprise outings. I don't know what it was, but it seemed to be something that I didn't quite understand yet, but soon would.\n\nOnce, for example, we were invited to a party and because I had a beer or a whiskey, she stayed sober to drive us home at the end. It was a dark, rainy night. The rain was pouring down on the windshield, making it hard for the windshield wipers to keep up. In fact, it was raining so hard that she saw the deer on the road too late. I, who was trying to come to terms with myself and my alcohol level, only felt the heavy braking and the bang that followed. After that I regained my senses enough to realize that she had introduced the deer to the bumper of the car. Immediately afterwards, she jumped out of the car, ran over to the already dead deer and fell to her knees. “I'm sorry my little one! I'm really, really sorry!” she cried out loudly. It was just an animal, nothing more, I thought to myself. At least we were unharmed. But when I saw her there with the deer in her arms, her dress soaked in blood, I finally understood. She seemed to be reaching emotional levels that I couldn't even begin to perceive.\n\nAfter that, her bouts of depression became more frequent and far worse. So bad, in fact, that some evenings I found myself back in the pubs, other than where she worked. Sometimes I got so drunk to the point of near insanity that I was just a thought away from putting an end to my suffering with my cell phone in my hand. And as fate would have it, one night I worked up the courage and, in a fit of selfishness and self-loathing, I dialed her number.\n\n“Hey, darling!” she replied on the other end of the line. “Are you coming over later? I've gone shopping for your favorite meal and rented a really great movie from the video store!” I swallowed hard: “Rachel, listen ... we ... We need to talk.” “Oh? What's going on? Has something happened?”. I took a deep breath: “It ... It's about us and our current situation.” Suddenly there was silence at the other end. “I've been thinking and I think ... I think I need a break from all this. It's not you but ... it's just a bit much at the moment.” I heard a quiet sob. “Do you really feel like that? You ... You said you'd be there for me, no matter what. You ... You promised me ...” “I know Rachel ... I'm sorry but I think it's become a bit too much ...” And then she suddenly hung up. At that moment I realized what a load of crap I'd said. Breaking up on the phone? What a dickhead I was. But now I couldn't undo it anyway. And then it came back to me: “Fuck ...” I thought. “I still have to pick up my things from her.” So I quickly finished my drink, paid and swayed my way to her. The sooner I get there, the sooner I get away, I thought to myself.\n\nWhen I reached her apartment, I noticed that the lights had been switched off. She must have gone for a walk to think, or so I thought, or rather hoped. Luckily I still had her spare key, which I had to leave there anyway. So I went into the apartment and noticed that it was a real mess. You should know that she always kept the apartment tidy and clean. But here it looked anything but tidy, at least in part. The chest of drawers had been knocked over, her jacket was on the floor and the TV was still on. This was very out of character for her, but I thought maybe she had just walked out out of anger over the break-up. And apparently she was so upset that she even forgot to put her shoes on. For my part, I grabbed my few things, put the chest of drawers back in place and put the key to the apartment on top. As I did so, I noticed some letters on the floor. They must have been lying on the chest of drawers and fallen down with it. So I picked them up at the same time. I mean, if I'm going to tidy up a bit, I might as well put the letters back. And you can think I'm an ass, but I've always valued privacy. But I noticed a strange logo on one of the letters. “Grand Memorial Hospital”. A hospital? But she didn't have any physical ailments, did she? I thought to myself. But even though I had just broken up with her, I was still interested in her well-being. So I put the other letters back and took a closer look at the letter from the hospital. To be precise, it wasn't just any letter, a formality or anything else, but a medical report.\n\nA medical report that made me sit up and take notice. I didn't understand everything it said, but as far as I could make out, Rachel was suffering from a severe type of end-stage cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease to be precise. This was probably associated with a rhythm disturbance with an increased chance of sudden cardiac death. I'm not a doctor, but the word “cardiac death” made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Why had she never told me about this? And then it hit me like a plank in the face. Her melancholy and depressive fits, her appreciation of the well-being of others and of life itself. Rachel was terminally ill and I stupid bastard had only made things worse. That also explained the mess in the apartment, the sudden hanging up of our call and the fact that she had left her shoes here herself. The shock on the phone must have given her a heart attack. Yes, that had to be it. And since I hadn't found her in the apartment, she must have called the emergency doctor. Without giving it much more thought, I ran out of the apartment and made my way to the nearest hospital. Fortunately, there was only one hospital in this small town and even though I had no certainty that she had been taken there, I had no other option.\n\nThe longer I walked, the closer I got to the hospital, the more I blamed myself. What kind of idiot was I? Why hadn't I noticed before? Why didn't I think about my words beforehand? 20 minutes later, I reached my destination. I rushed in and asked for Rachel. The lady at the desk told me which room she was in and without listening to what she had to say, I ran straight off. When I arrived, she was lying unconscious in a bed, connected to various pieces of equipment. A doctor was present and was probably filling out a report or something. I introduced myself to him and asked about Rachel's state of health. “And doctor? Is she going to get better? Will she get better soon?” The doctor sighed with a deep breath: “Listen, Rachel here is not going to get any better. Her illness is progressively terminal, do you understand that? We've stabilized her at the moment, but I'm afraid she only has a few hours left. Only a miracle could save her. My heartfelt condolences.”\n\nThe doctor left and I sat down by the bed. “So that's it?” I said in a hushed voice. “Is this how it's all going to end? Is this all the time we have? What about our promises? Yes, I was an idiot, but if only I had known beforehand ... You can't just leave me like this, not like this. I can't let that happen, no, I can't and won't accept it.”\n\nWhat a cruel irony of fate, I thought to myself. Just as those who know the nature of words do not play with them. A guiding principle that I think we should remind ourselves of much more often, but not do so. Only to regret it in the end. An end that we often don't see coming and reaches us far too quickly for us to be able to react to it in any way.\n\nBack in my apartment, I sat down on the floor in the middle of my living room. A few hours should be enough, I thought to myself. You know, I'm not a believer. I was only ever as good to others as my own morals told me to be. I've never been to church, I've never prayed and I don't believe in God or miracles. But I know that there is more out there somewhere than we can comprehend with our human minds. That there are things that we don't understand, but that are nevertheless as present as the air we breathe. And I knew that even if there were no miracles, I had to bring one here. One life for another. And so I spoke the incantation for the devil out loud ..."},"714":{"title":"Hiya!

Its eyes were completely crossed and very red but still almost pale, and had tentacles that I used to believe was just there for no reason. It's skin was like it was covered in an almost blackish but red coating with it also lacking no colour all the way down to the ground. Most of the time they would be creeped out by this but also interested as to how it just ended up hear. I was also confused as well and jokingly told them that it \"Needed me to satisfy it's hunger\".\n\nIt wasn't until there was this one incident that completely changed the way one of my friends would look at statues, or should I even call it a statue?\n\nIt happened when I called my friend which I will remain anonymous, so I will call him by the name of \"S\" because it is his first letter of the first name, and told him I could give him a tour on some antiques I owned and even one of them that I would remain last since the fact he is always interested about the true meaning of hell and its demons and how they existed. He agreed and when he first looked at the warehouse, he was astonished as to how big it was. Even going far to call it a \"Factory\". I ended up letting him see some of the stuff that was there, like vases, Statues and even paintings by famous artist's (Don't worry, I let an art investor take them to be sold). S got pretty bored of this and was urgently wanting to see what would amaze him. I accepted and showed what was inside the empty room that lied this secret. S's reaction was overwhelmingly shocking and appalled but was stunned as to how big it was. He ended up wanting to tell me if he would like to share this to the world, but I told them to \"Not to tell a single soul, or there will be consequences on the matter\". He agreed to me but did want to take some pictures, in which I agreed. I told him that there was nothing special about it, other than the fact it was almost like an amalgamation of the Cthulhu and Satan, but a bit smaller. But he was still impressed to see how it looked. We then were about to leave the room, but then we heard a growl. A growl which almost came from the statue. I then stopped thinking about it and left, but then a wet splat was heard. I then eventually had concerns about the statue and S thought I was being dumb. Until, something worse happened.\n\nWe then heard a loud screech that echoed the room and morphed into a scream of a man in agony. I then saw the tentacles behind him starting to completely go haywire and started splattering the whole room with the black substance which felt as if it was acid. It's mouthless jaws started to dissolve and melt like candle wax to reveal an infinite amount of teeth that let out the screams of what I believe to be the true sounds as to what hell would be like if it broke loose. S and I wanted to get out as soon as possible, but then came the moment which changed him for complete eternity. It's stomach exploded to reveal an extremely blank, pale face of screaming faces, elongating it's neck to pounce on its victim. And those eyes, those bloodshot eyes that were filled with dread and anguish was what stuck to my mind the most, and I can't unsee it still to this day. It's mouth started to spread wide open like a viper fish and eat S. And just before it could get worse, the face went through the ground and left no trail of it's skin nor it's blood. But my friend was lucky to not witness what it could truly be like to be stuck in a cauldron for eternity. And then after that, the acid that came out off the tentacles dissolved, leaving no trace. And the demon returned to its original form.\n\nI don't know how to end this but all I can say is that my friend was desperate to know \"Why the fuck this ended appearing!?\" and \"Why do you still have it!?\".

At first, Kelly just said she didn’t want to sleep because her friend wouldn’t let her. We thought it was just teenage boredom, especially after the recent separation between me and my ex-wife. Her brother, Matt, just shook his head, annoyed. He didn’t understand why his sister was acting that way. But when she started talking about killing, everything changed.\n\nKelly was 15, and she had always been a quiet girl. But after the separation, something drastically changed in her. She kept talking about a \"friend,\" something that initially seemed harmless. We thought it was a phase, maybe a way of coping with the chaos at home. Until one night, she looked me dead in the eyes and said her friend had told her to kill Matt.\n\nI was sitting on the couch when I heard her voice through the cracked door. Kelly was whispering like she was having a conversation. When I asked who she was talking to, she laughed, but it was a nervous laugh. \"My friend,\" she replied. I asked her more about this \"friend,\" and she just stared at me, unblinking, and said, \"She doesn’t like Matt. She wants him dead. And Mom too.\" My body froze.\n\nI tried talking to my ex-wife, but she brushed it off as teenage drama. \"You worry too much; she’s just acting out her frustration,\" she said.

He swore she was talking to someone in the dark.\n\nI decided to sleep on the couch, near their room. But during the night, I heard footsteps. Slowly, I went to the hallway. Kelly was standing in the middle, looking right at me, but she didn’t seem... like herself. Her eyes were empty, cold. She said in a voice that didn’t sound like hers: \"She wants Matt. She’ll do it.\"\n\nThe next morning, I tried to convince her to see a psychologist, but Kelly went hysterical. She screamed, throwing things, saying her \"friend\" wouldn’t allow it. My ex didn’t know what to do and eventually agreed. We went to a session, but the doctor only suggested light medication. It didn’t seem enough.\n\nThen Matt started getting sick. He complained of a tightness in his chest, like something was suffocating him. His nightmares were constant. He said Kelly’s friend came every night and stood at the foot of his bed. He looked pale, with deep circles under his eyes. Kelly, on the other hand, was growing more distant, colder.\n\nThat week, I found crosses made of dry twigs under Matt’s bed. Kelly started drawing strange symbols on her bedroom walls with red paint. She said it was her “friend” telling her to do it to protect us all. But it was clear this wasn’t protection.\n\nI didn’t know what else to do. I went to the local church and spoke with Father Samuel. He listened seriously but didn’t seem surprised. \"I’ve heard similar stories before,\" he said. \"It might be more than just a psychological issue.\" He agreed to come to the house to see what he could do, though he remained skeptical.\n\nWhen the priest arrived, Kelly locked herself in her room, screaming that \"he\" wasn’t welcome. Matt, on the other hand, was restless, complaining of intense headaches. The priest said a prayer in the living room, and that’s when things got worse. Kelly started banging on the door, screaming that \"her friend\" was furious. She wouldn’t stop shouting, pounding the wood with force.\n\nThe priest looked at me, visibly shaken. He said he would need help, that this was beyond his capabilities. But before he could leave, Kelly’s door burst open. She was standing there with a bizarre smile on her face, her eyes glazed over. \"She’s here,\" she said, pointing to the empty air beside her. \"She wants to talk to you.\"\n\nThe air felt heavy. The priest began praying again, but Kelly started screaming, scratching at herself as if trying to tear something out from inside her. The sound of her screams was deafening. Suddenly, everything went silent. Kelly collapsed to the floor, but before she did, she whispered, \"She won’t stop until she gets what she wants.\"\n\nI took Kelly back to the doctor, but nothing helped. By then, Matt was completely terrified, refusing to be in the same room as his sister. He kept saying Kelly’s friend was getting closer every night. The priest, now fully convinced this was no mere fantasy, brought another clergyman to help.\n\nThat night, they decided to perform a special prayer in Kelly’s room. As they prayed, the lights began flickering, and a foul odor filled the air. Kelly started convulsing in her bed, her eyes rolling back as she mumbled incomprehensible things. It was as if something had taken over her.\n\nThe fear on Matt’s face was clear. He looked at me and said, \"She’s here, Dad. Right behind you.\" I quickly turned, but I saw nothing, just a chilling coldness creeping up my spine. Something was terribly wrong. It felt like the house itself was turning against us.\n\nThe next night was even worse. I woke up to find Kelly sitting at the edge of Matt’s bed, whispering something in his ear. I rushed to her, but when I tried to pull her away, she pushed me with a strength that wasn’t human. The look on her face wasn’t hers. She smiled again and said, \"Now she wants you too.\"\n\nDesperate, I begged the priest to do something. He agreed to perform an exorcism, even though he wasn’t authorized by the church. This was a last resort. Kelly wasn’t herself anymore. She spent all her time muttering to the empty space, talking to this \"friend\" that now seemed more real than ever.\n\nDuring the exorcism, things escalated. Kelly screamed, her eyes rolled back, as the priest struggled to maintain control. Suddenly, the window shattered, and a gust of wind rushed in, almost knocking everything over. \"She won’t leave,\" Kelly screamed, her voice distorted, like two voices speaking at once.\n\nThe exorcism lasted for hours. The room was a wreck, and the priest was exhausted. But when it finally ended, Kelly collapsed, unconscious. The silence was deafening. The priest, sweaty and trembling, just whispered: \"She’s gone... for now.\"\n\nKelly never returned to her old self. She was admitted to a psychiatric facility soon after, and Matt began to have a more peaceful life. But every now and then, he still wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, saying he feels someone standing by his bed. Something tells me that this \"friend\" never really left.\n\nAnd every time I pass Kelly’s empty room, I get a chill down my spine. As if someone is watching me."},"719":{"title":"looking for video from 2018-2021","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f52242\/looking_for_video_from_20182021\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Psychological_Arm240","selftext":"\nIm looking for a creepypasta video on YouTube where a character finds a job testing a video game.

They didn’t see me; they never do anymore. They looked so healthy, their eyes brighter than I’d ever seen. I couldn’t help but remember how different they used to be—how different we used to be—back when this all started.\n\nIt was four years ago, on an overcast morning in early September, the kind of day where the clouds hang low and seem to press down on everything. I was sitting in class, my head down, lost in the droning voice of my teacher as she scribbled equations on the whiteboard. I wasn’t really paying attention—math never held my interest, and I had other things on my mind. My parents had been fighting a lot, and the tension at home was suffocating. My escape was school, but even that was starting to feel like a prison.\n\nThen, the teacher called out a name I didn’t recognize. I didn’t think much of it at first—new students came and went, and I wasn’t the type to keep track of everyone. But when a soft, unfamiliar voice answered from behind me, something made me turn around. There, in a seat that should have been empty, was a pale, thin figure with eyes so red they looked raw, as if they hadn’t slept in years. Fireflies, hundreds of them, flickered and swarmed around their head, passing through their skin as if it wasn’t even there. I remember thinking they looked like a ghost.\n\nNo one else seemed to notice. The teacher continued with her lesson, and the other students were engrossed in their notes or doodling in their notebooks. I felt a chill crawl up my spine, a coldness that settled in my bones. I turned back to face the front of the classroom, trying to focus on the board, but the equations blurred into a meaningless haze.\n\nClass went on as usual, with teachers coming and going, students laughing and whispering, but my mind kept drifting back to the strange figure in the back of the room. When the bell rang for recess, everyone got up and rushed out, eager to escape the confines of the classroom. Everyone except me. I stayed behind, my feet rooted to the floor by a feeling I couldn’t quite explain. It was a mix of curiosity and fear, a strange pull that made it impossible to leave.\n\nThey stood up, their movements slow and deliberate, and walked over to an empty desk near mine. They pulled out the chair and motioned for me to sit. “Well, you’re slow today. Come on. Ask me your questions.”\n\nI should have run away, but I didn’t. Maybe it was because I was lonely, or maybe I just didn’t believe anything bad could really happen to me. So, I sat down and asked, “What are you?”\n\nThey didn’t know. They told me they used to be a regular kid, just like me, until one day they woke up like this—surrounded by fireflies, forgotten by everyone. They’d been alone for years, cursed to be invisible to the world, with no one remembering them for more than a few minutes. It was a hard story to believe, but something about it stuck with me. Maybe it was the way they spoke, the sadness in their voice, or the way the fireflies dimmed whenever they talked about their past.\n\nI can’t explain why, but instead of dismissing it as a joke or a dream, I stayed. They told me how I’d notice them every day, talk to them, then forget as soon as I walked out of the room. It was an endless loop of loneliness. I felt a pang of sadness, but also a strange connection. For some reason, I didn’t want to forget them.\n\nI did something stupid. I grabbed a pair of scissors from my backpack, pressed the blade against my arm, and carved their name into my skin. It hurt like hell, but I didn’t care. I wanted to remember them. I wanted to break the curse.\n\nThe next day, when I saw the name on my arm, I remembered. And for the first time, we had a real conversation. They were shocked that someone actually remembered them. I started spending more time with them, sneaking out at night to meet them, feeling more alive than I ever had before. We became close, closer than I’d ever been with anyone. But I could see the changes—their skin growing paler, their eyes more bloodshot.\n\nOne winter morning, I almost lost them. I woke up, got dressed, and forgot to roll up my sleeves. Without seeing their name, I didn’t remember them. It wasn’t until I got to school and felt a strange emptiness that I realized something was wrong. When I finally noticed the tear in my jacket sleeve and saw their name on my arm, I remembered. They had been yelling my name for twenty minutes, trying to get me to notice them. That was when we realized how fragile our connection really was—how close we were to losing each other forever.\n\nWe spent the next year searching for answers, pouring through old records and books, trying to understand what the fireflies were. We found stories, hints of others like them, all of them forgotten, their lives erased. Then we found it—a journal, a twisted, horrible account of a man who had cursed them. He had found a way to summon these things, these “fireflies,” and use them to make children disappear, forgotten by the world. He described in sickening detail how he would take children, let the fireflies latch onto them, and then do whatever he wanted to them, knowing no one would come looking. Eventually, the children would become like them—pale, forgotten, barely human.\n\nThe journal also described a way to break the curse. But when they asked if I had found anything, I lied. I couldn’t tell them. I couldn’t take away the only thing that had ever made them happy—our connection.\n\nA few minutes later, they shut down the computer and picked up the last book. When they finished it, they tossed it aside and told me to go home. I hesitated, standing outside the library door, listening to the sound of their quiet sobbing. I couldn’t leave them like that. I went back, sat down beside them, and we talked. They told me they wished they’d never met me, that they were happier when they had nothing to lose. I knew what they were really saying—they were afraid of losing me, afraid of being forgotten again.\n\nWe kissed that night. It was our first and only kiss, and I wish it could have just been that—a kiss. But I did something I’ll never forgive myself for. I stole one of the fireflies. I don’t know why I did it, maybe out of some twisted sense of love or sacrifice. The moment I took it, the fireflies began to leave them and come to me.\n\nThey reached for me, but I pulled away. The last thing I saw in their eyes was confusion as they forgot who I was. I walked away, disappearing into the crowd, knowing they would never remember me.\n\nThat was a year ago. I’ve been watching them from a distance ever since, seeing how much better their life has become without me. They have friends now, a life I could never give them. Meanwhile, I’ve been deteriorating. My skin’s getting paler, my eyes hurt all the time. I can feel the fireflies inside me, changing me, erasing me.\n\nYesterday, I saw them crying at their birthday party. For a brief moment, our eyes met, and I thought I saw a flicker of recognition, but it was gone before I could be sure. I know I’m not going to last much longer. I’ve found Joey’s pit—the place where he buried all those forgotten children. There’s a grave for them now, a place where they’ll be remembered.\n\nMy mom is happier now too. She had her surgery, and I saw her playing with my baby brother. Without me, she can afford the life she deserves.\n\nI’m leaving for good. I know they’ll never be happy if I stick around. But I’m happy I met them, even if they don’t remember me. At least one of us got to live.\n\nBut the worst part is, I’ve started carving their name into my arm again. Even though I know it’s killing me, I can’t stop. I need to remember them, even if it means I’ll disappear completely."},"721":{"title":"help finding a video i saw years ago when i was a kid ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f4spep\/help_finding_a_video_i_saw_years_ago_when_i_was_a\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"liyaby","selftext":"ok so hello. \ni don’t use this subreddit but i wanted to come on here bc i got reminded of a video i saw on youtube years ago and i don’t know how to find it. i was a weird kid, i loved watching these videos of creepy shit that happened, like creepy dolls left in the middle of the woods next to an abandoned house. shit like that. now, i remember seeing this one video and im pretty sure it was some sort of fake scenario, a horror mini story type of video if that makes sense. now in the video, i think it was a group of friends driving in the middle of the night and the person who was sitting in the passenger seat was filming the situation in a vlog type of way. the person behind the camera says that they’re lost and trying to find the main road or something and the guy filming blames the guy driving for getting them lost. after a bit, they finally find the main road but when they turn to the road, they realise they’re on a totally different road than what they thought. they were freaked out bc they were sure that they turned to the right road. then there was a guy in the middle of the road, and im pretty sure he was like two dimensional or something or in a way glided towards the car ???? and the group of friends asked if he was ok or something like that, but then we see the weird guy kill the group of friends and the guy filming or one of them just bashes his head into the camera until he dies and the video ends there. it’s pretty gruesome and weird and idk how i watched that when i was a kid but now i want to find it and watch it again to see if it’s as scary as i remember it, and to see if my memory is correct. if anyone knows what im talking about and knows what the clip is called on youtube, id be grateful !!!! thank you :)"},"722":{"title":"Dopamine detox ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f54hsl\/dopamine_detox\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I love a good dopamine detox and with all of the social media around us, our minds are in constant attack from constant information and entertainment.

Now I don't use social media that much and I got my dopamine fix from conversing with people. I have a large circle of friends and I love socialising and that's my dopamine fix. Though I do give myself a month where I don't talk to anyone to get a good dopamine detox. \n\nIt's hard at first and you crave all that dopamine which you have been accustomed to. I get the urge to just talk to someone and to have conversations, but I resist. Then you get use to it and when all that dopamine has become so low, you adapt to it. I am all alone now in my home and then when I see someone walking towards my, I get the urge to talk to them. I go out with my gun and I shoot them dead. Nothing will disturb my dopamine detox. My brain needs a break. \n\nI shoot a few more people who were close to my house and I say to myself, better them dead than my brain full of dopamine. Then I end up with a few dead bodies in front of my house. I am now enjoying my dopamine detox but then some of the dead bodies get up and try to have a conversation with me. I become so angry but at the same time I have been starved of conversation.

It looks so good and just seeing all of them conversing and socialising, I want to join in. I resist thought and I go out and shoot all of the dead people again. I also started to hack off their limbs and faces. I am serious about this dopamine detox. I don't want any conversations about anything and my brain needs to have a break from the drugging that is socialisation. I shoot more people just walking past my house. \n\nThen the new people that I had killed started to talk to me.

Ill never forget anything about that day. It was an early morning in mid October and as usual, dad was ready for the annual camping trip. \"Son get up, get dressed and lets get a move on.\" Dad said. My eyelids peeled open slowly as my body booted itself on. \"I'm up pops just got to get my gear together.\" I said. \"Be down in 15\". I lied. I got dressed, grabbed my bag and headed downstairs. Dad was outside checking the engine on the truck, and mom was watching the news in the kitchen. \"Dad said send you out when you came downstairs.\" Mom Said. I ran over to my mother and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \"Love you momma ill see you in a couple days.\" I said. She said it back hugged me and shooed me off. Dad was getting the last bit of the equipment packed so I decided to put my stuff in the car and wait for him to finish.\n\n\"Son come help me with this.\" Dad said\n\nI made my way over. \"What's wrong pops you getting to old for this?\" I laughed\n\n\"Ill never be to old to whoop your ass.\" He laughed\n\nAll of a sudden my father demeaner completely changed.\n\n\"Tony, If anything ever happens son Never go camping again.\" He said cryptically\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean dad?\" I said but he ignored me and kept going.\n\nHe acted like he didn't just say that to me. I kept loading gear and just ignored it. I helped him with the rest of the equipment, we loaded it all up and got into the truck. My dad was a very kind man. Give you the shirt off his back kind of guy. He was funny, caring, and made you feel like you could conquer the world. He was also quiet and standoffish at times which I figured was his military service bleeding out. He never really talked about it but mom would always say \"Dad came home after the war ended, But his mind is still at war.\" Some nights he would wake screaming and Id hear mom promising it was all ok and he's ok. But for the most part he was an amazing man who treated his family like royalty.\n\n\"So kiddo are you ready for this years camping trip?\" Dad asked.\n\n\"Of course I am pops.\" I said. Lying straight thru my teeth, but I couldn't let him know that because it would crush him. I'm 16 now and I have a Girlfriend, this is getting to be kid stuff to me, But I love my dad and I Know what this means to him.\n\n\"You sure you're not upset you have to leave your little girly back home.\" He joked.\n\nI brushed off the comment and sighed. He laughed and continued to drive out to the campsite. It took us about four hours to get out there. Its out in the middle of no where California, nothing but high trees and higher mountains. Our campsite was situated right on the side of a cliff I began to pull the camping stuff out of the truck. I noticed my dad pacing and muttering under midbreath. He made his way around the area \"checking things out.\" He seemed a little agitated but I brushed it off and kept pulling things out. An hour or so later and camp was set up. It was about 3pm at this point and we were starting to get hungry.\n\n\"Lets get down to that river and get us some dinner.\" Dad said.\n\nI agreed and we made our way down to the river. It was a 5 minute hike down from our campsite to the water. When we got down to the river I noticed the cliff our campsite sat on overlooked it. The river was quite violent, churning rapids loud as plane engines. The roar could be felt in your chest. My father made his way down the river to a split off that ran into a creek. He explained The slower water was perfect for catching fish and then he froze. Abruptly his voice stopped. I looked over and noticed dad was staring into the woods and whispering something to himself I couldn't make out. His eyes so glazed over I'm surprised tears didn't begin to fall. I could hear him saying what sounded like \"This last time\" but I wasn't sure. I made my way closer to my dad.\n\n\"Dad are you ok?\" I said, but he didn't move an inch. I looked out into the woods but seen nothing. I reached out to grab is shirt.\n\n\"Dad?\" I fearfully asked. Fingers outreached trembling towards him.\n\nAll of a sudden he snaps out of it twisting his head towards me smiling.\n\n\"The slower water is perfect for catching fish son.\" he said. His head twisting slowly back towards the river.\n\nI was quick to notice that this episode looked a lot like the symptoms of my fathers PTSD but he immediately snapped out of it. I was creeped out to say the least. The way he turned his head back towards the water scared me a little. I've never been afraid of my father but that scared me.\n\n\"Son hand me my fishing pole, Lets see if we can get us some grub.\" He said.\n\nI handed him the pole and we began to fish. We caught what seemed like 100 fish. It basically turned into sport seeing who could catch the most. The entire time we were fishing and laughing, The episode played in my head on repeat. I tried my best to just forget it and enjoy the day with my dad. We went back to the campsite after fishing for a couple of hours. We scaled the fish, gutted them, and skewered them on some branches and began to cook them. Dad grabbed a beer out of his cooler, sat down with a piece of wood and began to whittle it. I stood at the cliff and looked at the river. I grabbed a rock and chucked it down into the water. Id say we were about 75 feet up but I wasn't sure. I turned and looked at my dad wanting to question him about what happened today, but I couldn't. Maybe I was to afraid to trigger his PTSD I'm not sure what it was but I couldn't. Dinner finished and we sat down to eat. Besides the creepiness of the day id say it went pretty well. Dad cleaned up the dishes and I started to gather more wood for the coming day. By this time it was about 8pm and we were winding down.\n\n\"How was your dinner son ?\" He asked.\n\n\"It was awesome dad, Thanks for cooking.\" I said\n\nHe shot me a thumbs up and started whittling the wood again.\n\n\"Hey dad, What happened to you on the river today?\" I worriedly asked.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" He asked.\n\n\"you froze up dad and repeated something you just told me.\" I said.\n\n\"Froze up? What are you talking about?\" He asked agitated\n\n\"It was nothing dad, you must not of heard me.\" I said\n\n\"I haven't been sleeping very well that's all, don't worry about it ok son.\" He said calming down.\n\nHe gestured over to his sleeping bag.\n\n\"Imma hit the hay son, Ill wake u up early morning so we can go hunt.\" He said.\n\n\"Alright goodnight, love you dad.\" I said\n\nHe disappeared into his tent and I did the same. I fell asleep quite fast from the activities of the day. All of a sudden I'm woken up to a scream. Not just any scream but it sounded to me like the scream of someone being tortured. As soon as I sat up in my tent it went quiet. no bugs, no fire crackling, no river, nothing. I unzipped my tent slowly and stuck my head outside. It was pitch black outside except for the glow of the moon on objects. I climbed out of my tent and made my way to dads tent. I unzipped it and stuck my head in.\n\n\"Dad are you ok.\" I said.\n\nAll I could hear was my father mumbling in his sleep. My father was having a conversation with himself.\n\n\"you cant take them, they're my family.\" He whispered\n\nAll of a sudden a voice came out of my father that couldn't have been his own. A deep guttural voice almost demon like.\n\n\"I will take you, then I will take them.\" It Growled\n\nI stumbled backwards out of the tent and fell to the ground.\n\n\"Tony are you ok?\" Dad asked peeking out of the tent.\n\n\"Yea sorry dad I was just checking on you.\" I said\n\n\"Are you ok dad?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head yes and told me to go back to bed.\n\nThe rest of the night was calm. I laid in bed for an hour or so playing what I just heard over and over again in my head. I'm not sure what to chalk it up to but I was almost certain that wasn't PTSD. The following day it was pretty normal. We hiked around some, Fished some more, and gathered wood for the night. He didn't say much all day and seemed irritated. All in all another good day. I dared not ask dad about what I heard him say in his sleep. I'm not even sure he would have told me.\n\n\"Alright son I'm out.\" Dad said.\n\n\"Love you pops, see you in the morning.\" I said not knowing that was the last thing Id ever say to him.\n\nWhen I got into my tent I could feel anxiety creeping up my back. The events of last night burning into my memory. I forced myself to stop thinking about it. I began to tell myself to calm down and man up. All of a sudden a noise that i can only describe as bones and meat squelching, moved thru our camp and towards the cliff. I stood up and looked around in the darkness. That's when I noticed it. A silhouette of my dad standing completely still on the cliffs edge, whispering, and looking down at the river. I gasped in horror and began to sprint towards my dad. I got about 10 ft. behind him and froze. I could finally hear what he was saying.\n\n\"You can have me but not them, This is the last time you hurt me.\" He said whispering.\n\nDad are you o...\n\nBefore I could even finish the thought my dad looked back at me and said \"Never agree to go camping again son.\" and he leapt off of the cliff.\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" I screamed. The shock I felt almost made me pass out. I stood there emotionless not understanding what just happened. Feeling slowly coming back to me I began to sob. I ran to the cliffs edge but there was nothing I could have done. Staring into the darkness listening to the roar of the river below, Reality began to set in. I need to get help right now. I grabbed the keys and hopped into the truck and drove all the way home to get help. I drove home in shock. I could swear I kept seeing my dad in the back of the truck The entire 4 hour drive was a blur. I got home and rushed to my mother and explained to her what happened.\n\nShe collapsed and began to sob. We called the authorities and they went out to search. Not a single trace was found of my father. It was like he disappeared. That was two years ago. I'm 18 now and its coming up on our annual trip. I haven't gone in the last 2 years since I moved after that. I'm going up to stay with my mom for the weekend.\n\nThe night I got there was the night before the annual trip. I got in, greeted my mother and had dinner. That night I woke up to a cold chill running up my back. I opened my eyes and stared around the dark room. It was so quiet in the room it frightened me. A whisper broke thru the darkness. \"son get up.\" It whispered. I sat up on the bed and rubbed my eyes. That's when I noticed it. A persons face looking at me from the bottom of the window looking into the back yard. More specifically my fathers face. His skin was paper white and his hair was matted. His eyes were black and evil. He began to speak in a quiet deep tone.\n\n\"Son are you ready to go camping?\" He said raising a had and tapping on the window with his long sharp fingernails.\n\nTAP TAP TAP his fingernails rhythmically tapping the window pane. \n\n\"Ive missed you all this time son, why did you leave me?\" He cried.\n\nHe began to open his mouth wider than anything I've ever seen. His cheeks tearing straight to his ears and his jaw hinging open. I jumped out of be and flipped back to look at the window. I stared in absolute horror, frozen by what I was looking at. I didn't say anything. I couldn't say anything. I backed away slowly and his eyes followed me. I flipped the light on and its gone. I run from my room straight into my moms.\n\n\"mom are you awake.\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"yes I'm awake son what's wrong.\" She asked.\n\n\"Mom we need to leave right now, something is outside and it....\n\nJust then my mom cuts me off.\n\n\"He cant get you son if you don't agree to go camping.\" She said as she rolled back over and went right back to sleep.\n\n\"mom what the hell is that supposed to mean?!\" I yelled but she ignored me. Confusion and anger had set in at this point. What was going on? This is crazy I thought to myself. Did I really just see my dead dad staring at me thru the window. I decided to step outside and see for myself. I'm not gonna be able to ever sleep again if I don't figure this out. I walked around the house to where my window was and nothing was there. Just the woods behind our house and nothing more.\n\n\"Wont you go camping with me son.\" A voice called from the woods.\n\n\"wont you please?\"\n\nI stopped moving and slowly turned to look at the woods where the voice came from.\n\n\"I'm going to get you, Just like I got your dad!\" It yelled in a piercing screech. \n\nJust then a bright white figure completely naked on all fours scuttles out of the woods towards me and begins to scream horrible screams. I fall backwards on my ass and close my eyes waiting for the inevitable end. The screams getting louder and louder until they're almost right on top of me. I feel long fingers wrap around both of my ankles, Finger nails digging into my calves. \"This is it.\" I though to myself. The thing that killed my dad is going to kill me then my mom. As soon as the thought entered my head all I could hear were my dads last words. Never agree to go camping again son. I snapped out of it.\n\n\"IM NOT GOING CAMPING WITH YOU!\" I screamed at the top of my lungs my hands covering my eyes.\n\nSilence.\n\nI pry my hands away from my face and look up expecting to be met with some horror. Nothing was there. No sign that anything had even been there. At my feet was a small wooden cross with the words father and son carved into it. The cross my father whittled. I picked it up and keep it with me to this day. I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or not but I know this for sure. I'm Never Camping Again."},"726":{"title":"\"Burroughs' Drive\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f501i7\/burroughs_drive\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Logan966","selftext":"I’m a skeptic, so I laughed when my stupid friends told me about a road that swallows cars; I set out on Burroughs’ Drive to prove them wrong.

He was bruised up pretty badly, but nothing was broken, and he had no internal bleeding. The rest of us were shaken, but unharmed save for a few painful spider bites and newfound fear of what was once had been a peaceful and welcoming forest.\n\nI, on the other hand, suffered four broken ribs, a bruised humerus, and my entire torso was black-and-blue with hoof-shaped welts. It wasn’t pretty, but at least it wasn’t anything too serious. It still hurt like hell though.\n\nTasha threw a motherly fit when we got home and told her what happened, and she forbade the kids from going back into the woods again. I restriction nobody wanted to argue against, not since that day. It was as if the entire forest had turned against me and my family. It was no longer the open and welcoming place we had all loved and enjoyed, but a place of menace and very real danger.\n\nIt took us all a couple of weeks to finally settle down after that horrid experience. But, as is in life, we found a new normal where we simply stayed safely clear of the woods, and it started to feel comfortable.\n\nOne night, after I had fully healed from my deer assault, we were all lazing comfortably about the living room watching the latest Pixar movie as a family. It was a lot of fun, but by the end of the movie, I was the only one who had not fallen asleep on the couch.\n\nI gently shook my wife. “Tasha,” I said quietly enough so as not to wake the kids. “Come upstairs to bed.”\n\nMy wife responded by groaning slightly and remaining fast asleep.\n\nI tried three more times with the same result, so I decided to just go to bed by myself and leave everyone else in peace. I went upstairs, disrobed, got into bed, and promptly fell asleep.\n\nSome time later I was woken up by the feel of my wife sliding into bed with me. She pressed herself up against my back and wrapped her arms around me, holding me tight. I could feel that she wasn’t wearing her pajamas. She kissed me on the back of the neck, and began to caress my body, ultimately reaching down and groping me passionately.\n\nMy eyes still closed, I loosened her embrace and turned to face her. I kissed her passionately, reveling in her soft lips and the smell of flowers on a spring breeze. I ran my hands up and down along her voluptuous form, settling one hand on her bare belly.\n\nHer firm, flat belly.\n\nWhat?\n\nThat was not the belly of a woman who’d given birth to three children. It was as perfect as a teenage athlete’s, without any of the natural changes that come with carrying a baby to term.\n\nI snapped my eyes open and stared into the face, not of my lovely wife Tasha, but Jessica.\n\nHer gorgeous emerald-green eyes sparkled in the dim moonlight that filtered in through the window. “Take me now my husband,” she said in a sultry voice. “We’ve been married for twenty-six years. It’s time. Consummate our marriage!”\n\nMy mind reeled and all I could do was react on instinct. I screamed and pushed her away, hard. She yelped slightly as she slid over to the edge of the bed. Then she fixed with a look of sadness and disappointment.\n\n“Get out!” I shouted. “How did you even get in here? What do you think you’re doing invading my home? Why would you . . . GET OUT!”\n\nJessica sighed and stood up; her naked form perfectly illuminated in the moonlight. “I’m here to consummate our marriage,” she replied softly, but firmly. “We’ve been married for over twenty years and have yet to consummate our vows. It’s not right.”\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “We’re not married!” I shouted back. “We were kids. It was a game! My wife and children are downstairs! You shouldn’t be here! You need to leave now and never come back!”\n\nJessica’s eyes flashed with anger. “Stop shouting at me!” she hissed. “That’s no way for a husband to treat his wife!”\n\nI was absolutely furious, but I did lower my voice. “You think this is bad?” I threatened. “Just wait until Tasha gets up here and sees you in our bedroom! You’ll be lucky if all she does is call the cops!”\n\nJessica smirked, and even that look of scorn was somehow beautiful on her. “She won’t be coming up here tonight,” she declared confidently.\n\n“What?” I said, confused by why she would even think such a thing. “She’ll be here any moment. There’s no way all my shouting didn’t wake her up.”\n\n“Oh,” Jessica said silkily as she sat down sidesaddle on the edge of the bed. “She’s still very much asleep. All of them are, and they won’t wake up until at least an hour after sunrise.”\n\nShe said it so confidently that I found myself believing here even though it was ridiculous. I opened my mouth to speak, but stopped and just listened. The house was silent. Nobody was racing up the stairs to check out my screams. There was no commotion downstairs of children suddenly woken up my sounds of alarm. Nothing.\n\nI turned my head and looked Jessica in the eyes. “How?” was all I could ask.\n\nShe smiled widely, her full, perfectly shaped lips forming the most beautiful smile I had ever beheld. “Because nature favors our union,” she replied as if that explained everything.\n\nI blinked. “What do you mean?” I asked cautiously.\n\n“She reached out with one hand and gently stroked my cheek. “Don’t you understand?” she asked softly. “We exchanged marriage vows in the place that is sacred to my ancestors. The magic of that place binds us for eternity. Our union is woven into the very fabric of nature itself. That’s why it gets so angry when you deny me.”\n\nI opened my mouth to protest; to tell her how ridiculous she sounded, but stopped. I thought back to the day Tasha and I kicked her out of our house, and the storm that felled the tree that nearly killed my family. I thought back to the last time I went in the woods with our children, and how the whole forest seemed to turn hostile. I wondered what might happen next if I simply threw Jessica out the window and got rid of her.\n\n“There is magic remaining in this world,” she told me. “Not much. The fey are few and far between, but far from gone. So magic remains, and these woods,” she swept her hand toward the window to indicate the forest out back, “are one of the places where that magic is strong. My family has dwelt here for untold millennia, and we will dwell here, in body and spirit, for many millennia to come.”\n\nNothing she said made sense. It violated the natural order as I understood it, and it all sounded like the delusional ravings of a lunatic to me. “There’s no such thing as magic,” I replied. “And we’re not married.”\n\nAs if on queue, a lightning bolt struck the back yard, the thunderclap shaking the house from foundation to peak.\n\nJessica smiled. “Then explain why your family is still asleep downstairs, even after that.”\n\nI tried to answer. I wanted to. I needed to, but I didn’t have one.\n\n“I don’t know,” I admitted.\n\n“It’s because I’m your wife, and nature itself favors our union,” she said.\n\nShe stood up again, put her hands on her hips, and demanded “Do I not please you to look at?”\n\nI stared at her then, taking in every last flawless detail of her immaculate form. I thought I knew beauty before. My wife was easily the most beautiful woman in the world to me, and despite her insecurities, every blemish that pregnancy and childbirth left on her body only made her more beautiful to me as those were her marks of motherhood, left by her giving me three beautiful children.\n\nBut if my dear Tasha was a ten, then Jessica was a ten-times-ten. Her every feature, every curve, every last millimeter of her body and face was absolute perfection. Everything was the right size, shape, and, I now knew, feel in every possible way. It was almost unnatural how perfect this woman was.\n\nEven her smell . . . it filled the room and tantalized my nostrils with the scent of a spring breeze blowing through a field of the most fragrant wildflowers imaginable.\n\n“You do, very much.” I admitted.\n\nShe leaned forward, placing her hand on the bed in front of me, bare breasts bouncing sexily with the movement, and paused with her face barely an inch away from my own, so close I’d barely have to move to kiss her.\n\n“And do you desire me?” she purred.\n\nThe simple answer was yes, yes, a thousand times yes. My body yearned for her in the most carnal way imaginable. How could it not?\n\nI stammered.\n\nShe looked down at my groin. “You don’t have to say anything,” she purred. “I can see your answer right there.”\n\nShe started to lean in. Her lips puckered to kiss me.\n\nIn that moment it was though time stood still everywhere but inside my own head. I had the objectively had the most beautiful, most desirable woman in the world right in front of me, naked, and practically begging me to merge my body with hers. My family was downstairs in a sleep so deep that I could do anything with this woman and none of them would ever know. I felt passion and longing for her on a level I hadn’t known since as far as I could remember.\n\nMy family was downstairs.\n\nThat thought broke my stunned state.\n\n“No,” I moaned, practically in a whisper.\n\nJessica paused, and a confused look clouded her features. “Do you desire me?” she asked again.\n\nI took a few deep breaths to steady my nerves and take control of my won mind. “No,” I repeated. “With all my heart I do not. I’m a married man. I love my wife. And, God help me,  I’m a faithful husband.”\n\nJessica’s features twisted in rage. She looked terrifying, but undeniably beautiful. “You’re married to ME!” she shrieked. “This is my right as your wife, and you will give me what is mine!”\n\n“No.” I said again, terrified at the transformation this woman had taken from seductress to fury. “Not tonight. Not ever. Tasha is my wife, and I will not betray her.”\n\n“You betray me by being with her!” Jessica growled.\n\n“You need to leave,” I said meekly, but firmly. I’m going downstairs to be with my family. You can get out whatever way you got it. Just leave.”\n\nI didn’t wait for her to reply. I slid out of bed, turned my back to her, picked up my pants, and put them on. “And don’t come,” I turned as I spoke, and was shocked to see that Jessica was gone. She was gone so completely it was as though she had never been there in the first place.\n\n“ . . . back,” I finished.\n\n\\*\n\n“And that deer is still hanging around my house like nothing happened!” I finished as I told my boss the story for what must have been the tenth time.\n\nChuck chuckled and shook his head in amusement. “I think that deer must be keeping an eye on you,’ he joked.\n\n“Don’t even go there,” I replied. “It’s creepy enough that it’s always hanging around without assigning some unnatural motive to it!”\n\n“Or maybe it’s entirely natural,” he replied with a smirk.\n\n“Don’t even go there,” I said with very real exasperation. “That woman I told you about you keeps going on and on about nature, and spirits, and them approving of our supposed union. The idea that this buck is spying on me for her is just plain creepy. And I still can’t believe she broke into my house and tried to seduce me in my own bed! But the creepiest part of that whole experience is that she was right. My family stayed asleep until an hour after sunrise no matter what I did to wake them up. I think she must have drugged them somehow.”\n\nI shook my head in disbelief. “What really made it extra spooky was the fact that none of our phones worked until the woke up too. That, and the lock on the door was jammed and I couldn’t open it to get them to the car and run them to the hospital. And you know what makes that even crazier? It suddenly started working when they woke up! I have no idea how she managed to do any of that!”\n\n“Don’t worry about it,” he replied with a slight chuckle. “At least, not anymore today. It’s almost time to clock out. You still bringing the family over for dinner tonight?”\n\n“You bet,” I replied enthusiastically. “Nothing better than a back yard barbeque except for a backyard barbeque where someone else is doing the cooking!”\n\n“Get out of here!” Chuck laughed. “Get that family of yours ready and head on over. My sister’s dying to meet my work friend I’ve been telling her about. I’ll wrap things up here and be home and cooking well before you can make it.”\n\n“You don’t need to tell me twice,” I gladly replied, and left.\n\n\\*\n\nSomething that all married men with children understand is that you will never leave or arrive on time. Between the wife putting care into her appearance and the chaos of kids who are constantly being distracted when they should be getting ready, there is a zero percent chance of everyone being ready to go on time. And that’s why I always lie about when we need to leave to be anywhere. I tell the family we need to be somewhere fifteen minutes earlier than we really need to, and everyone is late according to the time I told them, but they’re ready on time for the real time. It worked great too, until my wife figured out what I was doing. So now the kids are ready on time, but the wife isn’t.\n\nIt's okay though. At least this way the kid chaos is done before we run out the door, and I really do appreciate the care my wife puts into her appearance even after being married as long as we have.\n\n“Fashionably late,” Chuck joked when he answered the door. “Come on in and make yourselves at home. Food’s on the grill, and beer’s in the fridge.”\n\nWe all joined him inside. I helped myself to a beer as Tasha got the kids settled in. Then I joined Chuck in the back yard.\n\n“I hope you guys don’t mind Beyond burgers,” he said as I joined him at the grill. “Nobody in my family eats meat.”\n\n“I won’t tell if you don’t,” I replied. “What the kids don’t know won’t weird them out.”\n\n“Deal!” he laughed. “These are almost ready. Mind keeping an eye on them while I go tell my sister to set the table for us?”\n\n“Not at all,” I replied, and he quickly went inside, and came back out a minute later. We chatted a bit as the burgers got their final sear, then Tasha stepped outside.\n\n“Honey!” she called. “I need you inside!”\n\n“Wifey calls,” I told chuck with a shrug, and he shooed me off to go see what Tasha needed.\n\n“She’s here!” Tasha hissed as soon as the door was closed.\n\n“Who?” I asked.\n\n“That woman! The one who thinks she’s your wife!”\n\n“What? No!” I replied in shock. What’s she doing here?\n\n“Hot food coming through!” Chuck announced as he opened the door. “Jessica! Time to get everyone served up with drinks!”\n\nTasha and I stepped aside to let him through.\n\n“Who’s Jessica?” I asked as he passed me by, desperately hoping that his answer would be that she was his girlfriend or something similar.\n\n“My sister,” he quickly replied as he rushed off to the dining room.\n\nMy eyes went wide in sudden fear as I realized the predicament both I and my family were in. Jessica was my boss’ sister, and I was friends with him, but I needed to keep her and her obsession with me as far away from my family as possible. The conflicts of interests suddenly sprang up in a tangled web, and I had no idea how to navigate through without getting stuck.\n\nDinner went surprisingly well, but the tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Chuck and Jessica both played the part of gracious hosts. The kids ate their meatless hamburgers without complaint or even noticing that anything was different. My wife restrained herself despite being visibly uncomfortable.\n\nThe dinner conversation was strained, but unproblematic. If either Chuck or Jessica caught on to my discomfort, not to mention my entire family’s discomfort, neither of them let on.\n\nEventually, Chuck made a comment that set my already frayed nerves on edge. “So, big sis here has been going on and on forever about this amazing man she met,” he said after swallowing a bite of burger. “She’s madly in love with him, but she has yet to bring him around to meet het little brother. Can you believe it?\n\n“Uhhhh . . .” I murmured for a moment. “No. Not at all. She strikes me as the kind of woman who would want everyone to meet her man and know that she’s his woman.”\n\nJessica laughed heartily at this as though it were a joke and not the accurate description she knew it to be. “I would, but he’s not ready for that yet,” she quipped. “He’s the reluctant sort.”\n\n“Well, he can’t stay reluctant forever,” Chuck quipped. “If you two are together, he’s eventually going to have to make it public.”\n\nTasha was visibly upset at this exchange, and while neither one of us knew for sure if Chuck was aware that I was the man Jessica was referring to, we both suspected he did.\n\n“Maybe he has other commitments,” she said testily. “Maybe he doesn’t want to go public because he doesn’t feel the same way about you that you feel about him.”\n\n“Impossible!” Chuck laughed. “Just look at her! Every man in town wants to be with her, even the married ones, but she’s a good one I tell you! She’s a goddess with domestic duties. She’s easily the most charming woman I’ve ever met. On top of that, she’s been saving herself for her one true love, and if she says she found him, how could he help but love her back?”\n\nTasha scoffed. “How? If he’s already married, and he’s a good, faithful man, he will never love her back, and nothing she does will be able to change it.”\n\nThe kids knew who Jessica was, so the significance of this exchange wasn’t lost on them. They stayed quiet, politely eating their food, but I could see how uncomfortable they were with the situation.\n\nChuck hand waved Tasha’s comment away and redirected the conversation to our current project at work and how pleased he was with my performance. He even called requesting my transfer the best decision he ever made.\n\nMy family took it all in stride, and we finished the meal without any more incidents.\n\nOnce the meal was over though . . .\n\n“I’m so glad we got to spend this time together like a proper family,” Jessica casually commented.\n\n“Don’t you spend a lot of time with your brother?” Tasha asked suspiciously. “Earlier, you said that you live together.”\n\nJessica laughed. “Of course we do,” she giggled. “But I wasn’t talking about him,” she said as she fixed her gaze on me.\n\nI knew exactly what she meant, and it absolutely horrified me. “Chuck, we need to head home. It’s a school night, and if we stay much longer the kids won’t get to bed on time.”\n\n“But we haven’t had dessert,” Jessica cooed. “Surely everyone wants to stay for that.”\n\n“Actually, we really do need to get the kids home and ready for bed,” Tasha replied. “It’s been lovely, but we can’t stay for dessert.”\n\nThe kids remembered Jessica, and they knew exactly why their parents wanted to leave. None of them protested for dessert, and little Lisa stretched and yawned theatrically.\n\nJessica glowered at this. “It’s rude to leave before dessert!” she said sharply.\n\nBoth me and Tasha stood up. “I’m so sorry,” I said apologetically. “We really do have to go. Maybe next time.”\n\nChuck stood up as well, and I shook his hand. “Thank you for the invite. Dinner was lovely, and the kids never caught on that they were eating veggie burgers.”\n\n“What?” the kids all asked, almost in unison as they groaned. “Gross! You tricked us!”\n\nTasha already had her purse and the kids all stood up to follow her as she turned toward the door.\n\n“You shouldn’t leave,” Jessica said ominously. “It’s not safe for you to leave.”\n\n“You really shouldn’t leave,” Chuck warned as I was ushing my children toward the door.\n\nI stopped. “You too, chuck?” I snapped, my darkest suspicions confirmed. “When I told you about the woman who was harassing my family, did you know it was your sister I was talking about?”\n\nChuck nodded his head. “Of course I knew. My big sister has been telling me about you her whole life. Telling me about this wonderful boy who was destined to be an equally wonderful man. About how you two were married in the magic glen before our ancestors, and how she longed for nothing more than your return.”\n\n“So, you’re in on it?” I demanded.\n\nChuck shrugged nonchalantly. “Up to my neck, I’m afraid. Why do you think I requested your transfer here in the first place? It was to reunite you with my sister.”\n\n“That’s insane!” I shouted. “I quit, effective right now! I’m taking my family and we’re moving far away from this place! Neither one of you contact us ever again!”\n\nI didn’t wait for a reply. I simply ushered my family out the door and slammed it hard behind us as my wife gave me the most loving look.\n\n\\*\n\nThe ride home started out fine, me ranting angrily and swearing that were packing up and skipping town that night, until we got to the road that ran along the woods. A strong wind blew through the forest, much like it did the day Jessica first showed up to my family’s home. The sky darkened as thick clouds rolled in out of nowhere, and a sudden deluge of rain fell from the sky. It fell in a curtain so thick I could barely see the road in front of me. I slowed down enough that I felt safe enough to drive, but it was still tense. In such a heavy rain, anything could happen, most of it bad.\n\nA lightning bolt shot down from above, lighting up the area so brightly that, for a moment, I could see clearly despite the blinding rain. It struck a nearby tree, splitting it down the middle, with half of it falling in the road directly in front of the car.\n\nThanks to a combination of driving slow and antilock brakes, I was able to stop the car in time, but the road was blocked. “Stay in the car!” I commanded everyone as I unbuckled my seatbelt.\n\nI got out of the car, getting instantly drenched, and walked over to the fallen tree. I put my hands underneath it and tried to lift it. It was heavy, but I was just able to lift enough that I should be able to move it out of the way so we could drive home.\n\nI felt a heavy thud in my ribs as something large struck me from the side, knocking me over. I rolled over onto my back, and I saw that it was the same buck that was always hanging around my home. “Dammit!” I yelled. “You stupid deer! What did I ever do to you?”\n\n“It’s not what you did to me,” the deer replied in a gruff voice. “It’s what you did to her!”\n\nThe shock of a deer actually talking only had a moment to set in before something even more shocking occurred. A tree, the willow tree from the forest glen, came striding out of the woods, walking on its roots like an octopus walks with its tentacles. It whipped me with several branches, stinging my shoulders and face before moving to the car. My family inside screamed so loudly that I could hear them over the storm despite the car muffling their sounds.\n\nThe great tree bent over and wrapped the car in its branches and began to squeeze. I could hear metal crunching as it began to buckle.\n\n“Wait!” I screamed. “Please stop! Why are you doing this?”\n\nThe tree stopped squeezing and held still. The deer walked in between me and the tree and changed. It still had the lower body of a deer, but the torso became that of a man.\n\n“Chuck?” I gasped in disbelief. “What are you?”\n\nChuck looked at me scornfully. “I really don’t understand what my big sister sees in you. You’re unfaithful and ignorant. You don’t even know that I’m a satyr, just like you never knew that Jessica is a dryad.”\n\n“What?” I gasped. “You’re a . . . and she’s a . . . that’s all myth and legend! It’s not real!”\n\nChuck scoffed. “And yet here we are my dear friend. Do you realize that my sister spent her entire life looking for you? That she spoke to every bird that migrated through about you, asking them to seek you out for her? Do you have any idea how elated she was when one finally came back telling her that it found you and you were working for an IT company hallway across the country?”\n\nChuck knelt down in front of me and lowered his voice. “I got a job with the local branch of our employer for one reason and one reason alone. To become a manager and request that you be transferred here so my dear sister could be reunited with you. I thought it would make her happy, but all you’ve done is reject her and break her heart. Because of you she’s sad, angry, and disappointed. Why should we stop?”\n\nI was broken, and I could see only one way out that saved my family from this creature I had thought was my friend, and his pet monster tree.\n\n“I’ll do anything,” I said through my tears. “Name it, and I’ll do it, just let my family go.”\n\nChuck stood up and called out over his shoulder. “Did you hear that?” he called out to the tree. “What do you think?”\n\nThe tree stayed unmoving for a moment, then it loosened its branches and straightened up. It turned and started to walk toward me, and it shrank and morphed with every step until it was the size and shape of a familiar woman. “Anything?” Jessica asked. “Even leave your false family and spend your life with me, your true wife?”\n\nNodding my head I sobbed “Yes, just don’t hurt them. Let them leave and live their lives in peace far away from here.”\n\nJessica knelt down and placed her delicate hands on the sides of my face and gently tilted my head up. She was smiling radiantly. “Of course,” she said gently. “Anything for you my dear husband, as long as you’re with me.” Then she leaned in and kissed me.\n\nHer kiss was like rose petals against my lips, fragrant and sweet. It sent a shock though my body, but not an unpleasant one. Rather, it made me desire her in a way I had never known before. I shuddered with pleasure, and every thought I had of sneaking off to rejoin my family once they were safe left my mind.\n\nJessica looked me in the eyes and smiled sweetly. “They can go, but know this: the fey may be few, but we are still widespread. If you betray me, your false family will be found, and the woman’s life will be forfeit.”\n\nHer words sunk in, the dire warning they contained processing through my muddled mind. “Only Tasha?” I asked dumbly.\n\n“Of course,” she replied. “The children must live. They are special, just like you.”\n\n\\*\n\nI still work at my old job. Chuck disregarded my resignation since it was outside of work and never submitted formally. Tasha took the kids and left that night. I never saw them again. Our only contact was divorce papers arriving in the mail a year after they left. I think that they hoped that I would find a way to escape and come back to them, but that was never in the cards. Jessica, my true wife, and chuck, my brother-in-law, made it very clear that if I broke my vows all of nature would seek justice for Jessica.\n\nNo. It was best for them to move on with their lives without me.\n\nI signed the papers that day and mailed them back. I got the official decree a month later.\n\nThe next day, Jessica and I wed according to human tradition as well. I don’t know how she made the arrangements so fast, but she was the most radiantly beautiful bride I have ever seen. She said the dress she wore was her grandmother’s, and that it had been in her family for generations. Yet it fit her perfectly, and looked as though it was new out of the tailor’s shop.\n\nThe guests were all from her side of the family. Her father, grandmother and grandfather, and many more were in attendance. Many were childless, never having found a fey fertile human. Her mother never married her father, so she had aged and died like a normal human having born only two children.\n\nNow my true wife, the wife of my youth, lives with me in the house I once shared with my false family. She’s pregnant with our first child, and she couldn’t be happier. She says it’s a girl and will be a dryad like her. I’m not really sure how that works to be honest, but apparently dryad children are dryads if a girl, and satyrs if a boy.\n\nChuck is thrilled that he’s about to be an uncle. And Jessica manages to be radiant even as she enters the final month of pregnancy. She’s happy now. She has what she wants. She has the husband she wants. She is having the first of many children that she wants. She assures me that, unlike a mere human woman, she will never go barren, and she will age far more slowly, retaining her youth and beauty. She also tells me that once we consummated our marriage, the nature of our union changed, and now I will age as she does, meaning that I can expect to live a very long, healthy, and fruitful life.\n\nApparently, the fey are rare because they cannot make children with other fey, and humanity has changed in a way that is bad for their continued existence. Once, all humans could enjoy unions with the fey and produce offspring, but as technology advanced and belief in the supernatural has waned, the number of humans who can produce children with the fey has dwindled to extreme rarity.\n\nI am one of the rare, and precious few. Jessica knew this from the moment we met. It’s why we became friends. It’s why she married me in the magic glen according to the tradition of her people, and why she will never let me go.\n\nPerhaps in another world there is a version of me whose parents never moved away. And that version of me grew up with Jessica, fell in love, wed her properly, and is enjoying a blissful life where he is the envy of every man in town with the most beautiful woman and dutiful woman in the world at his side for centuries to come with no other family for him to miss.\n\nLord knows, Jessica has every quality of a perfect wife. Our home is immaculately maintained. Our meals are delicious and abundant, and neither of us gains weight no matter how much we eat or drink. She makes certain that my body is always satisfied in every way, and her company is always bright and pleasant.\n\nShe’s so good that I feel bad about missing Tasha and the kids.\n\nMy wife tells me that feeling will pass, and one day I’ll forget all about them. She always smiles whenever she tells me this.\n\nJessica tells me that I am to be the father of a whole new generation of fey. That our children will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and they will take on the task of repopulating the world. They will repopulate the fey, and they will repopulate the world’s scarce magic. Our world is to be returned to a more natural state. Technology is to be shackled and controlled. Nature is to be reinvigorated, and humanity is to return to its rightful place as stewards of the world and worshipers of the fey.\n\nAs for my former family, Jessica wasn’t just being kind when she told me my children are special. Remember when I said that there are few humans who can reproduce with the fey? It turns out we are extremely rare, never more than a dozen in the world at any one time, and all three of my children inherited my gift.\n\nThere are no records of a human bloodline passing the gift of fey reproduction from parent to child, and yet I did. There is a water sprite living as a fertility doctor in the nearest major city. Now that she’s pregnant, Jessica has been having me supply him samples of my seed. He is giving to his artificial insemination patients and will see if the children inherit my gift. If so, Jessica has agreed to let him use me during her own pregnancies So that he can create a supply of broodstock around the world. The fey are few, and fewer still ever get the chance to have children.\n\nAs for my children? The local fey have been told about them. We even received a letter just the other day. In it was a picture of my daughter, Lisa, playing with a boy about her own age. He’s a handsome one too, and rugged. He will grow to be a strong and sturdy man. How could he not? Skinwalkers are powerful, and he is her future husband.\n\nI could warn my children. I could get a letter smuggled out of town and let them know to be on guard against beautiful and charming members of the opposite sex. I could tell them that the fey have chosen them as husbands and bride just like Jessica chose me. I could warn their mother and tell her to take the children and flee to a remote and lifeless area where the fey cannot live. I could, but I don’t dare. I have to leave them to their fate, and pray that they get happiness without heartbreak, unlike their father.\n\nIt’s okay. It’s the right thing to do. I . . . I’m fine with this. How could I not be? I’m the lucky man with the wife who’s absolutely perfect in every way, and my descendants will rule the world. It’s every man’s dream, right? There’s no reason that I should regret any of this.\n\nAs for me, I’m happy. Of course I’m happy. Why wouldn’t I be happy? I’m a faithful husband. Faithful to my wife. To my true wife. To the only real wife I ever had. I’m a faithful husband. I’m a faithful husband.\n\nGod HELP ME . . . I’m . . . a . . . faithful . . . husband."},"732":{"title":"To end decreasing birth rate 【pt1】","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f4dnfo\/to_end_decreasing_birth_rate_pt1\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"artsygirlloveJesus","selftext":"            【Dr. Wells' journal】     \nThe percentage of older civilians compared to young civilians has a startlingly larg gap, and on top af this, same sex couples are desiring to have children(with the dropping birth rate, it's become significantly more difficult to adopt and seriates are scarce).

We're both so bloodthirsty.\n\n\n\nIn fact, if you asked my departed mother, you are so much worse. You, human, do not like blood as we do. Vampires sip the blood of man and beast for sustenance. My mother said you draw the blood of every creature because it excites you.\n\n\n\nMy mother said, that even those who faint at the sight of blood are hard-wired to love it, your desire just overcomes you. My mother said, you all will be the last species left on this planet because you are the cruelest. My mother said, across the millennia, it has not been good enough for us to bow to you, but we must be buried beneath you. \n\n\n\nI cannot even find peace in this cave.\n\n\n\nMy mother said, you have slain the Neanderthal, the Jinn, the Denisovans, the Paranthropus, Homo erectus, and even the vampire. \n\n\n\nThat is what I was told for the first one hundred years of my life and I still don't know what to believe.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I didn't care about any of that at the time. My mother lost my focus as she spoke as soon as she said both she and I would be dead soon. I had lived as a home-schooled child in in a small cave not knowing anything about the world for 100 years. She said she was on her last leg of life and I only had 40 or so years left despite my teenage look. She died that month.\n\n\n\nSoon ( in vampire terms) I was going to be dead but before that, I wanted to live. I wanted to party. I've never tasted human blood and I would never be interested in it. \n\nThere were songs to dance to and women to love. Why were we sitting in caves whining? I flew to the closest city and started my adventure. Then after failing in that city because I did not understand it (I was homeschooled remember) I went to a different city where things were much better.\n\n\n\nI learned to trust humans along the way, all thanks to my best friends Kathleen and Barri. I want to tell you I became their friends over mutual interest, or something noble but that's a lie and I will not lie on my deathbed.\n\n\n\nI met the girls when I was on a tear, going to a club or bar every night and waking up beside something pretty every morning. The hookups weren't important, just bodies for lust, adoration, romance, and memories for a couple of hours and then a bill for Uber in the morning. The night I ran into the girls something was different.\n\n\n\nKathleen sipped a blue drink and saw me coming. She tapped Barri, a girl who never understood subtlety, and Barri stared at my approach like a child does a new adult. Drunk and horny I sat beside Kath. Embarrassed easily, her face went red almost the same color as her pink dress.\n\n\n\n\"Hey,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\"Hey,\" Kathleen said.\n\n\n\nAnd then I vomited everything I had drunk in the last hour. The rainbow mix exhausted me and I almost fell out of my chair. Kathleen grabbed me before I could and Barri helped steady me.\n\n\n\nEverything went blurry. I was blackout by this point so this is just what I was told.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Barri said. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, man,\" a bouncer came by and grabbed me by the shoulder. \"I'll get this guy out of here. Sorry, he's bothering you.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, actually he's our friend!\" Kathleen interjected.\n\n\n\nNow, why would this girl lie to protect a stranger? She said she felt bad for me but after getting to know her better I know that isn't the whole truth.\n\n\n\nKathleen was a girl desperate to find Mr. Right. This was her greatest ambition. Now when I vomited on her shoes she knew I was not Mr. Right but the thing is Kathleen had vomited on a shoe or two herself, she didn't even drink, she was that nervous.\n\n\n\nGrowing up fat, with a stutter, and bad skin, guys weren't the nicest to Kathleen. \n\n\n\nExtreme diet and exercise, speech therapy, and puberty changed who she was on the outside but the years of rejection and bullying did a number on her. She was a nervous wreck around men she liked. Her constant failures only made her want true love more. Like Harvard graduates lusted for political power, Kathleen lusted for love. \n\n\n\nHer lust for love caused her to be a nervous wreck when the opportunity approached. Her stutter returned, and she would tell jokes that weren't funny and she brought an air of anxiety to the interaction. So, when she saw a boy stumble over trying to introduce himself she saw a little of me in her.\n\n\n\nKathleen and Barri brought me over to a couch. They sat me down and Kathleen went to get me some water. So, it was just Barri and I. Now, this is the part where I start remembering again because I thought Barri's question was so strange it almost sobered me.\n\n\n\n\"Did you mean to do that?\" Barri asked with genuine sincerity.\n\n\n\n\"What... no?\"\n\n\n\nNow, one thing you should know about Barri is that she might not have any idea about what's going on at any given time. It's interesting because she wasn't dumb either. She was accepted to an Ivy League school but turned it down to go to a school closer to her family. \n\n\n\nBarri just had gaps in her wide array of knowledge. I was homeschooled in a cave, I could relate.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,” she said. “I just know guys have like um, pick-up lines and stuff. You guys can be real tricky.\" She said tricky in what I'm sure she felt was a funny accent. It was cringy.\n\n\n\nI didn't say anything. My head was spinning.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, no, sorry I didn't mean to imply that you were tricky.\" She patted my back twice. \"I'm sure you're a nice guy.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at her and was greeted by the most unorthodox, unpracticed, and genuine smile I had ever seen in a club or anywhere in my life.\n\n\n\nNow one thing you should know about Barri is that because she had trouble not offending people and understanding people what she really wanted was to be understood and to be good. She was a part of about five different volunteer teams, a consistent church attendee, and was a big sister in one of those at-risk youth programs. As for being understood, she was a constant over-explainer.\n\n\n\nThey were flawed, silly people and I loved them for it.\n\n\n\nFor the first time since I walked into the human world, I realized I had found some humans I wanted to be friends with. And that's how our yearlong friendship began—a rainbow of impulse and chasing after what we want. \n\n\n\nI traded sex for friendship that night and never regretted it. It was easy. The girls were a lot like me all they wanted was to have a good time before their first year of college. So, there was no sex but secrets shared, the only thing naked between us was the truth, and we were bound by trust, not fuzzy handcuffs. And I wouldn't take back that experience for the world.\n\n\n\nThere was another who did not like it though.\n\n\n\nPerhaps, we all are slaves to our genetics... Do you know elephants hate lions and will chase a lion down to ruin its day? The same goes for whales and orcas.\n\n\n\nThere was something from the ancient world that was a proud slave to its genes.\n\n  \n\n\nWe clubbed every weekend night and songs steered our summer.\n\n\n\nIn July we were singing our hearts out to Chapel Ronan's best song, not Pink Pony Club, not Good Luck Babe but Feminomen\n\n\n\nHit-like-rom-\n\nPom-Pom-Pom\n\nGet it hot like\n\nPapa John\n\n\n\nAs soon as we entered a club we went straight to the dance floor and earned our drinks through sweat and laughs. After that, we headed to the bar to grab drinks and then decided who would wing for who in the search for love. That night Barri and I left Kathleen at the bar so Barri could wingwoman for me.\n\n\n\nWhile we were away an old man came up to Kathleen. Much to her chagrin, she always attracted men outside her age range. \n\n\n\nI don't remember what the girl I liked was wearing but Barri wore a bright yellow dress and had just re-dyed her hair to be blonde.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you like movies,\" Barri said to my target for the night after awkward introduction and conversations. \"Vlad really really likes movies,\" Barri said again without a hint of subtlety. In truth, she wasn't a good wingwoman at all but that was the fun of it. That's what made all of us laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Oh,\" the woman said, probably surprised by Barri's abrasive approach.\n\n\n\n\"Do you have a favorite director?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. I like horror,\" she was nervous. Her drink swayed ever-so-slightly in her hand. \"Oh, I saw Get Out recently it's my favorite movie so I guess Peele.\"\n\n\n\n\"You like Get Out better than Peele's other one... US?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pretty eyes and that little smile you do and blessed with good movie taste. I didn't know God played favorites,\" I mocked and flashed my smile and thanks to thousands of years of vampire genetics I'm told it is quite good.\n\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes but she did do that little smile I liked. My heart raced because I knew what this could lead to.\n\n\n\nBehind us, the old man still chatted with Kathleen. He was out of place for the EDM club we were in. He wore a plaid suit and loafers. The room glowed under the lights of the dance floor. \n\n\n\nNeon, orange, yellow, and pink painted the club. Dresses, tank tops, and white sneakers flowed throughout the room. This was a place for drugs, dancing, and laughter. *What did this old man want?*\n\n\n\nI am protective of my friends but Kathleen knew how to get rid of him. She was just taking longer than normal.\n\n\n\n\"Whatever,\" the nameless girl in front of me said. \"What about you? Who do you like?\"\n\n\n\n\"The only one better than Peele right now: Robert Eggers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oooh he is good,\" Barri chimed in.\n\n\n\n\"Better than Peele? Lie again.\" She mocked.\n\n\n\n\"You think I'm wrong?\" I pretended to be aghast and put my hand to my chest in protest.\n\n\n\n\"I know you're wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jordan Peele didn't make The Witch,\" I countered.\n\n\n\n\"Well, he didn't,\" she said and fingered my chest. \"You're right about God playing favorites because he definitely made you cute but gave you bad taste.\" Her touch and her teasing sent me into boyish ecstasy and she knew it. My toes curled and I fought back a larger smile that wanted to greet her.\n\n\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"It looks like you have a cute little smile too.\"\n\n\n\nThat would have sent me over the moon until Barri chimed in.\n\n\n\n\"I liked The Witch,\" Barri added not understanding at all that I was doing quite fine without her there.\n\n\n\nWe both stared at her. She took two big sips of her fruity drink without a care in the world.\n\n\n\n\"Shall we dance,\" I asked the trio.\n\n\n\n\"Eeek, let's go!\" Barri squealed\n\n\n\nMy film buff flirt shrugged and motioned for me to lead her. I did and looked back one more time at Kathleen and considered breaking it up.\n\n\n\nThe last time I did she got mad at me because she said he was offering to be her sugar daddy and she was toying with the idea if she should get one. Maybe, she finally decided on it.\n\n\n\nRegardless, we got to the dance floor. I am not a good dancer but more importantly, I am a free man. I'm not afraid to be off-beat or a fool. I will do what my body tells me to do or jump and sing the lyrics. On the third song since we were on the dance floor that's what I was doing. I jumped, screamed, and sang in front of my girl's face and she did it right back.\n\n\n\nGimme Gimme Gimme\n\nA man after midnight\n\nWon't somebody come chase the shadow away\n\n\n\nYes, it was effeminate. Yes, it was corny but like I said I was free. I was having a great time.\n\n\n\nThe girl I flirted with wiggled her finger at me to come closer.\n\n\n\nI pulled my new friend close to me for her to whisper something in my ear, purely for intimacy.\n\n\n\n\"That's not your girlfriend right?\" She asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why? Jealous.\" I asked. It was my turn to mock.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe, I just wanted to give you a little film education at my place y'know because I have such good taste.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, yes I would like a taste.\"\n\n\n\nShe gave me a playful smack on the cheek and pushed me off.\n\n\n\n\"That is not what I said.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, the music is just so loud. It's difficult to hear can you say it again?\" I said and stared at her lips, unashamed and making it clear what I wanted to do.\n\n\n\nShe bit her lip and glanced at me.\n\n\n\n\"Come here again and I'll show you.\"\n\n\n\nShe puckered up. I touched the small of her back and pulled her in. She put her two fingers on each side of my belt buckle and returned my embrace.\n\n\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw the old man in plaid grab Kathleen's wrist and pull her out of the chair. Kathleen and I made eye contact across the bar. Her eyes bulged and puffed with fear and tears.\n\n\n\nThat I would not stand for. I brushed my date aside and moved with the speed and strength that vampiric blood allowed me. Men dropped as I went through them. The floor of flashing lights and colorful shirts parted like the Red Sea and soon I placed my hand on the back of the man in plaid.\n\n\n\nA mighty push would be enough. He would fly across the room, crash against the wall, and receive a broken body as punishment.\n\n\n\nThat's what should have happened.\n\n\n\nInstead, he received the brunt of my power and only stumbled a few feet. He turned to me, his little head full of joy.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you are from the old world too! I smell the old blood on you,\" his voice was curling, it was like every word was yanked uphill going higher in pitch at the end.\n\n\n\nI was stunned into silence. I helped Kathleen up but didn't take my eye off the plaid man. He frightened me. No one should be this strong.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, she belongs to you! If I had known oh, if I had known. I have much gold and a few souls. I will buy her. Name your price.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not for sale,\" I said. I had never met another nonhuman who wasn't a vampire before and I was not enjoying the experience.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, everything is.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not her.\"\n\n\n\nBarri came behind me and added \"Yeah, not her,\" then gave Kathleen a long list of eternal sorrows for leaving her.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, her.” the strange man said. “Yes her indeed and the pitiful one as well.\"\n\n\n\n\"I said, no.\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear son of the Count, do you know I am dying? Do you know what you do to me? You saying no... your resistance... your protection. It only makes me want them more. Are you aware because I have lived 1,000 years I have had everything I want? All that is left is what you want. Now name your price because everything has one.\"\n\n\n\nA bouncer came from around the corner and tapped the odd man on the shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"Sir, you need to leave.\"\n\n\n\nHe eyed the bouncer, all four foot of him eyed the six-foot-plus giant.\n\n\n\n“No,” he said. “I’m negotiating. Don’t interrupt an elf as he negotiates.”\n\n\n\n“Okay, let me walk you out,” the bouncer said.\n\n\n\nWith speed, much faster than me, the elf grasped the leg of the bouncer buried his hand in there, and yanked out dripping red bone.\n\n\n\nThe bouncer screamed and collapsed to the floor.\n\n\n\n“How will you do that with no legs?” the elf asked and the turned to me. He wiggled the bone in his hand and said. “Now, we were negotiating…”\n\n\n\nHe had to see it in my face. He had to see the fear. That was a lot of strength. To much strength. I tried to reply back but my throat went dry. He could talk though he was unmoved as everyone in the club ran out screaming upon seeing the bouncer’s crawling body trying to make it to an exit.\n\n\n\nI somehow found words and mumbled my reply.\n\n\n\n“Is that a number? Go on speak up.”\n\n\n\n“They aren’t mine to sell.”\n\n\n\n“What do you mean, Son of the Count? Have you not made them your slaves?”\n\n\n\n“No… they’re my friends.”\n\n\n\n“Then I will take them.”\n\n\n\nHis eyes gleamed with a sickening delight as he tossed the bloody bone aside. I never heard it clatter to the floor. Screams, the bouncer’s gurgling, and the bass of the speakers drowned it out. The elf’s eyes gleamed with a primal hunger, and his body shook with wanting. He stopped looking at me and eyed Barri and Kathleen.\n\nKathleen trembled behind me, her fingers clutched my arm,  her nails dug into my skin. Barri stood frozen, her eyes wide with shock. For once she had nothing to say.\n\n\n\nI leaped to him with a punch that could shatter bones, but the elf merely staggered, a twisted smile still plastered on his face. He moved with a fluidity that was both mesmerizing and terrifying, his every step calculated, predatory.\n\n\n\nWithout warning, he lunged at me, faster than I could react. I barely had time to raise my arms in defense before he was upon me, his strength overwhelmed me. We crashed into the dance floor, the impact shattered it. My back burned.  My head bounced against the floor. Neon lights flickered and flashed above us to match the quick, violent tempo of the song.\n\nHis hands wrapped around my throat, squeezing with the force of a vice. I thrashed beneath him, clawing at his arms, but it was like trying to move a mountain. \n\n“Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.” he said. “I am your brother here. You cannot befriend them you must rule them or they will betray you. I beg you. Yield.” \n\n“No,” I spat back.\n\n“Then you will be made to yield,” he said and grabbed my thigh with one hand and pulled out a bone.\n\nI howled. I cried. I was confused. And I was so angry.\n\n“It’s for your own good, Son of the Count. These girls…” he stopped his speech as both Barri and Kathleen crashed bottles against his head. They did not affect him. He swatted them away.\n\nI managed to free one hand. I unsheathed my nails and slashed them across his face. It loosened his grip. I broke free.\n\n“I guess I deserve that.” the elf said unamused. “We can be done with this boy. Again, I just ask you for your women?.” he rose and extended his arm to me.\n\nSomething snapped inside me. With a primal scream, I launched myself at the elf, sinking my fangs into his face. He howled in pain and I chewed. I chewed like a mad dog and ripped out every piece of humanity from his flesh. The taste of his blood was foul, like poison, but I didn’t care. I bit down harder, my anger gave me strength. The elf tried to shake me off, but I held on and tore at his flesh with all the fury I could muster.\n\nEventually, I got off of him and stood above him. He crawled away on his back, like a worm. His nose was gone, I had swallowed an eye and his face was more bone than meat. I felt a gross satisfaction with myself.\n\n“You… you..” he stuttered and sputtered his words, he only had one lip to speak with now and part of his tongue was torn. “ You would do this to another elder species for them?

He lived frugally, in a small house on a quarter of an acre, with a sensible car, and nothing too fancy in the house. If you'd driven past it you would have assumed some old timer on a pension was just moldering away his golden years there, and you would have been right in some ways.\n\n\n\nWhere he showed his wealth was in his generosity. Grandpa liked to give. He gave the best Christmas presents, had the best candy for Halloween, donated to charities, and liked to see people happy. If you asked him how he could afford to be so generous, however, he would always just wink and say he had his way. Not even my Grandmother knew where his money came from, and they were married for fifty years.\n\n\n\nSo when he died, we all wondered who would inherit his mysterious fortune.\n\n\n\nMy cousins had loved Grandpa, grandkids always do, but the two of us had always been close. My old man hadn't even waited till I was born to go grab some milk and cigarettes, and Grandma and Grandpa had helped my Mom raise me so she could go to work. I have a lot of fond memories of sitting with my Grandpa and watching TV, taking walks around the neighborhood, and eating ice cream at this little shop on the corner. He would always tell me to appreciate the little things because the smallest thing could be the one that changes my life the most.\n\n\n\n\"Take this,\" he would say, showing me the door knocker he often carried in his pocket, \"I found this when I was a very young man, sifting through trash in a landfill as I looked for bottles to sell. It became my lucky charm and it changed my life forever.\"\n\n\n\nGrandpa carried that door knocker for as long as I had known him, and it was pretty unique. It was a brass hand holding an apple and it was all meticulously crafted in exhausting detail. The fingers had individual nails, the apple had a stem and leaves, and even the knuckles had wrinkles on them had been carefully worked. I couldn't believe, as a young child, that Grandpa had just pulled this out of a dump, but he carried it everywhere, and I suppose it did bring him luck.\n\n\n\nThe funeral was beautiful, everyone there having nothing but kind words for Grandpa and his family. After the service, my three cousins and I were asked to come to a will reading at the Lawyer's Office and Grandpa had been as generous in death as he was in life. My cousins had received a trust fund for each of them, the amount payable on their thirtieth birthday with a small living expense each month. Grandpa hadn't left a trust for me but he had left me his little house, which I was pretty glad for.\n\n\n\nMom had recently married and, though I liked Mike a lot, it had seemed a little weird to have her adult son living in the house she was trying to make a new life in. Grandpa's old house was the perfect size for me, a college student with no real prospects of marriage in the near future. It was close enough to campus that I thought it would be ideal, but the lawyer had one more thing to give me.\n\n\n\n\"Your Grandfather was also very clear that I give you this,\" he said, handing me Grandpa's lucky charm, the brass door knocker.\n\n\n\nI thanked him, thinking I might hang it somewhere in the house in Grandpa's memory. It seemed only fitting to make a little memorial wall out of it. After all, Grandpa had loved the thing and it had been his only constant possession for years.\n\n\n\nSo, I moved in that day, taking my things and wishing my mom and stepdad goodbye as I, too, embarked on a new life.\n\n\n\nOver the next few days, I changed the house around a little. I hung my flat screen on the wall, I moved Grandpa's favorite chair around, I added my books to his bookshelf, and I donated his clothes and some of his other things to one of his favorite charities in town. I think Gramps would like the thought that his stuff would help people in need, and they were very thankful. A few of them offered condolences, having read about his death in the paper. Grandpa bought a lot of his stuff from Goodwill and Habitat for Humanity, but he also donated a lot so he was well-known to them.  \n\n\n\nIt was Friday, about four days after the funeral, when I noticed the knocker on the counter and remembered my plans to hang it and make a memorial wall.\n\n\n\nI didn't have anything else planned for that day, so it seemed like a fine pursuit.\n\n\n\nI hung the knocker in the living room, putting it above a little shelf where I put some candles and a picture of Grandad. I put his wallet up there too, something else he was never without, and I added a tin of Altoids, a pocket watch I had seen him wear, and a few other pictures of him. The door knocker was the centerpiece and it all looked very nice when I got done. As I finished I stepped back and admired it, thinking that Grandpa would have liked it too.\n\n\n\nThat night was the first time I heard the knocking.  \n\n\n\nI was lying in bed, doing some doom scrolling before I went to sleep when suddenly I heard a loud thump from the living room. I took out my earbud and listened, wondering if something had fallen over or maybe someone was at the door, but I didn't hear anything. I shrugged, thinking it had been my imagination, but just before I could slip the earbud back in, I heard it again.\n\n\n\nThree long booms from the living room and then silence.\n\n\n\nI got up, wondering who would be knocking on my door at this time of night. I went to the front door and looked out the peephole. I opened the door to see if someone was joking around, but there was no one there. The front porch was empty, and Grandpa didn't have bushes or anything to hide behind. The kid or whoever would have to be the freaking Flash to make it off the porch without being seen and I closed the door and started to go back to bed.\n\n\n\nI had come to the hallway that led there when I heard it again.\n\n\n\nThree long booms and then silence.\n\n\n\nI turned back, looking at the door, but there was nothing. The knocking hadn't come from the door, I would have been able to tell. No, it had come from the living room. I glanced around, looking for someone at a window or maybe the rattle of a woodpecker on the eaves, but there was nothing.\n\n\n\nI decided to just go to bed and try to make sense of it later, but that wasn't the last time I heard it.\n\nI heard the knocking a couple of times over the weekend, but I could never quite nail down where it was coming from. It was always either one, two, or three knocks followed by a ten-second pause and then the same number of knocks before it stopped. By Monday I was pulling my hair out, wondering if it was the pipes or something in the walls, and then finally I caught it.\n\n\n\nI had found a wedding picture of my grandparents sitting in a desk drawer, something Grandpa had probably put away so he wouldn't miss her, and decided it would look better on the shelf with his other memories. I was adding the wedding picture beside one of Gramps accepting an award for philanthropy when the knocker on the wall suddenly rattled and thumped. I jumped back, not sure what to make of it, but it thumped once, twice, three times, and was quiet for about ten seconds. I had just thought it might be a fluke or something when it did it again.\n\n\n\nThump, thump, thump, and then silence.\n\n\n\nI took it off the wall and looked for some kind of motor or something, but it was just a normal brass knocker.\n\n\n\nIt happened two more times that day and I was extremely curious as to what made it do it and why. I started going through Grandpa's desk, hoping for some explanation, and that's when I found the letter. It was in the middle of a ledger book, addressed to me, and it wasn't even sealed, which was unlike Gramps. It was just a single page of notebook paper, and I was glad to see Grandpa's cramped handwriting speaking to me from the page.\n\n\n\n*I hope you're enjoying the house, and I hope you found this letter in a timely manner. I had considered leaving it to Wilson to give to you, but I thought it might be better if you came across it naturally. Also, I wanted you to receive the knocker, and Wilson may have decided to keep it if he'd read the letter. He's a good man, an honest man, but greed can do funny things to people. You have probably noticed by now that the door knocker taps on its own sometimes. You wouldn't believe how I discovered its power, a complete accident, but I swear that what I'm about to tell you is absolutely true.*\n\n\n\n*The door knocker opens doors to different places. Place it on a door and wait for the knocks. Once it knocks, open the door and travel to where it takes you. The knocker only has three destinations, but they have been of great benefit to me and our family. When it knocks, you will have ten seconds to open the door. The second set of knocks is the doorway closing so it won't work if you catch it on the second set.* \n\n\n\n*One knock opens onto the Treasury, a room of treasures. Coins, gems, gold, all piled to the ceiling. If anything guards it, it has never bothered me, but I am always careful not to take too much.*\n\n\n\n*Two knocks opens onto the Library, a room stuffed with bookshelves. You can spend hours, days even, in this place and time won't pass outside the door. I have learned so many things here, things lost to time, and read about things that have yet to happen.*\n\n\n\n*Three knocks opens onto a Void, a darkness that I dare not enter. Anything you put in here will be gone, anything. There is no ground inside it, though, so don't walk in. I am ashamed to say that it's where I've been putting my trash, but it's also where I hid your dog, the one I said ran away when you were very young. He died suddenly, just lay over and died, and I put him in before you woke up from your nap. I’m sorry I never told you, but you were so young when it happened that I didn’t think you would mourn him for long.*\n\n\n\n*The knocks are never consistent, but each knock seems to come at least once a day. The three knocks usually come in the evening or early afternoon, one knock is usually in the morning or before noon, and the two knocks come's when it will. While you are inside, don't let the door close. I was stuck in the library for a long, long time once and was fortunate that your Uncle came along and opened the door. Time doesn't affect people the same way inside the door as it does here, so spend as much time as you want there. If you get hurt, however, you will still be injured, so be careful. You and I have always been close, and I know you and your cousins have speculated for years about my mysterious fortune. The knocker is yours to do with what you will, but always remember that money breeds difficulty, which is why I have always kept it a secret.*\n\n\n\n*Good luck, I love you, kiddo.*\n\n\n\nI read through the note a few times, trying to make sense of it. There was no way. Grandpa had always been sharp, not real problems mentally, but this sounded like the mad ramblings of a lunatic. The knocker, however, had moved on its own, that much was true. It occurred to me that there was a way to test the rest of it, so I decided to do just that.\n\n\n\nI took the knocker off the wall where I had hung it and attached it to the closet door in the living room. It looked a little silly there, a door knocker on a door that opened onto a closet with two coats and a bunch of board games in it, but I wanted to be sure. It was silly, the kind of thing you read about in fairy tales, but I wanted to be sure.\n\n\n\nI had a while to wait, but it finally happened just as I was thinking of going to bed.\n\n\n\nIt was around ten thirty and I was reaching for the remote to turn the TV off when I heard it. Two loud knocks, seconds apart, on the closet door. I popped up, remembering I had ten seconds to get there, and threw the door open. I expected to find the same closet that he had been there earlier. I expected this to be a joke from my Grandfather. What I didn't expect to find the great library he had talked about on the other side.\n\n\n\nIt was huge, a library to rival any I had ever seen, and the windows shone with perfect sunlight as I stood in shock. The shelves were tall, taller than the roof of the house I stood in, and they had long, trestled ladders with wheels to slide along the floor. I could see a grand staircase, and I felt sure there would be levels above the next as well. I could learn anything in there, I could learn everything in there, but I remembered what Grandpa had said about not getting closed inside and looked for something to prop the door open with. I saw an end table and pulled it over to put in the way, stepping inside and marveling at the space.\n\n\n\nI spent hours perusing books. There were books on languages, on history, on science, on anything I would want to know. I only explored the first floor that night, but there was enough here to keep me reading for days, maybe months. I was studying architecture at College, and there was a whole section of books I could use to study any period, any style, and anything else I wanted. This place was like the library they talked about in Alexandria, the library in the Harry Potter books, and some kind of wizard's private collection from a fantasy novel all rolled into one. Time may have moved differently here, but it didn't stop me from getting tired. I had been excited when I came in, but after a couple of hours of looking at books I was yawning and rubbing my eyes.\n\n\n\nI decided to come back another time and let the door close as I pushed the end table out of the way.\n\n\n\nIt was true, I couldn't believe it, but I had seen it myself.\n\n\n\nGrandpa had a magic door knocker!\n\n\n\nI spent the next few days testing each knock pattern, and Grampa's observations had been spot-on. I found the room with the gold in it the next day and it was almost more impressive than the library. Think of a room full of any kind of money you could want. Gold bars, US currency, ancient denari, little stones with things scratched on them, gems, pearls, silver nuggets, and other things I didn't have names for. I reached for a stack of hundreds with shaky hands and brought them out before letting the door close again. I had made about two grand in a matter of seconds, and I put it somewhere safe before heading to class. The Void was a little scarier when I got it, but I had been setting garbage bags beside the door in case I was home when the knock came.\n\n\n\nThe Void was just what it claimed to be. It was like looking out at the night sky, except there were no stars. It was an inky, unnatural blackness, and I wondered if maybe Nietzsche had been describing this place when he talked about staring into the abyss. The space was utterly devoid of anything, but it seemed to crouch as well, just waiting for me to drop my guard. The bags went in, falling into a soundless, airless void, before I closed the door again.\n\n\n\nIt was great for a while, truly a blessing. I had all the money I needed, and whatever I took seemed to come back after I shut the door. I could take books from the library if I needed to, and anything I left on the work tables would put itself back on the shelf. I spent a lot of time in the library when I could get there, and sometimes I would wake up to find I had fallen asleep. The door never slammed shut and trapped me in there, and without anyone to come behind me and accidentally close it I felt safe in there. I learned so much in a relatively short time, and my professors were impressed with my knowledge. I considered bringing them the books I used to gain this knowledge, but thought better of it. How would I explain it to them? A guy in his early twenties who just happened to have a book that was probably hundreds of years old was something that would probably gain the attention of the wrong sort of people.\n\n\n\nI was careful not to use too much of the money, careful not to spread it around too much, and careful not to show anyone the books from the library.\n\n\n\nIt went well for about four months, but then I started getting knocks of another sort from the door.\n\n\n\nIt started subtly, with little knocks and taps from time to time. I'm sure I missed a lot of them, but I would sometimes look up if I was watching TV or something, expecting to see the knocker tapping but find it silent. I started watching the door closer, seeing strange lights waft beneath it sometimes. They would skitter across the bottom, like strange shadows, and I found myself watching them more than the TV after a while. My trips to the other places were still uneventful, the landscapes the same as they had always been, but it was the times in between the knocks that I came to dread.\n\n\n\nThen, one night, something knocked back.\n\n\n\nI was brushing my teeth when I heard a familiar boom sound three times. I checked the clock and saw it was nearly eleven, a little late for knocking but I stuck my head out to look at the door, nonetheless. The toothbrush was still half in my mouth, and I had expected to see nothing stranger than the knocker fall back into place.\n\n\n\nInstead, something knocked again, and it wasn't the knocker.\n\n\n\nI came slowly out of the bathroom, watching as strange lights came flashing from between the cracks in the door. It was like a haunted house attraction, and I almost expected to see smoke billowing out from underneath it. The knocks were shy, almost uncertain, and I was preparing to head to my room when something hit the door hard enough to shake it in the frame. I jumped back, not sure what to make of it, and when it hit it again, I fell onto my butt and just watched it shake.\n\n\n\nWhatever was knocking was adamant about getting in, and it slammed its weight into the door again and again. The knob rattled, the door shook, and the lights flashed faster and angrier. My teeth were chattering, this had never happened before, and I was terrified that whatever it was might get through. It slammed into it again, the old wooden door cracking in the frame, and when it struck this time, I saw something break through the surface and come grabbing blindly from within.\n\n\n\nIt was an arm, a long, purple arm covered in scales.\n\n\n\nIt thrashed around, trying to find something to grab, and the sounds from within were like bats and birds turned up to a thousand. It shivered right on the edge of hearing and I expected my ears to start bleeding. It was looking for the knob, and I wasn't sure what would happen if it found it.\n\nInstead, it bumped into the knocker.\n\n\n\nIt fell off the door, it was only held on by a couple of screws, and as it clattered onto the floor, the most hellish sound of all ripped from the hole before being cut off as suddenly as it had begun.\n\n\n\nThe lights, the noise, and the banging all stopped with a suddenness that made me dizzy.\n\n\n\nI stood up, looking at the broken door, and walked slowly into the living room to see the extent of the damage. Something was bumping, but I thought maybe the arm had knocked something over. I wanted to make sure the knocker was okay, but as I came around Grandpa's old chair, I saw what was making all the noise.\n\n\n\nIt was the arm that had come through the door. It was leaking black fluid all over the hardwood and flopping around like a fish.\n\n\n\nIt didn't flop for long, but now I'm left with a problem.\n\n\n\nThe portal only seems to open when the knocker is up, but unless it's up, I can't open it.\n\n\n\nI wonder if this is why my Grandpa kept it with him so often.\n\n\n\nDid he, perhaps, have a visitor one night when he least expected it?\n\n\n\nFor now, I'm keeping the knocker in my bedside table, but even as I lay here writing this, I can hear it bump against the wood every now and again.\n\n\n\nThe money will eventually run out, that or my curiosity to learn will get the better of me, and I'll hang the knocker again, but I think, for now, I'll let it sit.\n\n\n\nNo need to invite trouble if I don't have to.  \n\n \n\nMy Inheritance had some strange rules"},"739":{"title":"Forgotten creepypasta name","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3ybtb\/forgotten_creepypasta_name\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Traditional-Matter38","selftext":"Okay, so I was listening to creepypastas a while ago and I recently remembered the storyline or thereabouts. I posted what I remembered into ChatGPT and this is what I got: The creepypasta you're referring to is likely *\"The Toy Soldier.\"* In this story, a young boy follows a toy soldier into the depths of his bed, which leads him into a strange, otherworldly adventure. The toy soldier takes the boy into a mysterious world hidden beneath his bed, full of odd and sometimes frightening wonders. However, the boy is warned that he must return to his bed before a certain time or else he might get stuck in this world forever.\n\nAs the story progresses, the boy becomes increasingly fascinated by the strange world he's exploring. However, he eventually loses track of time. In his panic to return, he struggles to make his way back to the top of the bed. Unfortunately, the boy becomes tangled in his blankets, unable to escape, and ultimately suffocates, leading to a tragic end.\n\nThis creepypasta plays on the idea of a child’s imagination taking a dark turn, blending the innocence of childhood toys with a nightmarish twist. It's one of those stories that taps into childhood fears and the eerie possibility of the familiar becoming dangerous.\n\nHowever, I don’t believe this is the name! Can anyone help me find out.

The warm days were ended by the sweet and mellow smell of her cooking. This year, my parents were on a trip, which meant that me and my brother got to stay at her house for a whole week. My brother, Isaac, is turning 8 next week and we were ensured a wonderful time. She sure had a way to make the most of our time before the sun went down. It was only her at home, and I got the impression that she thoroughly enjoyed her time when we arrived. The house must be so lonely. My grandpa had passed away many years ago. I can just barely remember him, but not enough to recall his voice.\n\nAt night, I slept upstairs. It was down the hall from my grandma and the bathroom. Isaac took the room directly below me. As much fun as the days were, the nights in the house were dark yet the shadows on the wall seemed to become clearer the more you gazed upon them. Unnerving, however, I did find the creaky rhythm of the house easy to fall asleep to.\n\nOne evening, during this week, the creakiness of the home turn into a rhythmic scratching on the ceiling above me. Curious, I dropped the attic ladder and crawled up to see what could be causing this acute noise. I walked towards the part of the room that would be above my bed and after a quick investigation I had discovered a small, faded part of the wood on the floor. It looked as if someone had rubbed something out on it. Funny enough, I noticed that the scratchy noise had diminished since I arrived up here.\n\nThe next night, I decided to investigate it again as the noise had returned. Something must be making it. I dropped the ladder again, and re-entered the room only to find that that the fade part of the wood was not scratched. It was as if someone had slowly scratched into the wooden flooring. Unsettling as this was, it wasn’t until I noticed the shadows of the room becoming larger that I decided to get out. Returning to my room, I decided to just attempt to sleep through the constant scratch.. scratch… scratch above me.\n\nAs time went by, there were only two more nights before we were to return home, and I had grown quite tired because it became harder and harder to sleep each night. This night the scratching above me was so loud that I was sure my grandma would awaken. I decided to sneak into the attic and see if there was an animal or something that was making this noise. I dropped the attic ladder and slowly climbed the steps. I peered my head into the room to see a man’s body hanging above the floor that was marked. I noticed his shoes slowly creeping across the floorboard that was marked as his body rocked back and forth. I ran back to my room and shut the door. I turned on the light as the shadows seemed to be watching me. It wasn’t until I saw a photo on my bedside table that I began to really question what I had seen. The clothes that the man was wearing were the exact same clothes that my grandfather was wearing in the photo on the bedside table. Was that my grandfather up there? How did he die? I hid under the blankets, unable to sleep. Spending the entire evening listening to my grandfather swing above me. Back and forth. Back and forth.\n\nOver breakfast, I tried to talk to my grandma about him.\n\nWhat was he like? – “Oh, he was a sweet man. He had a light about him in every way.”\n\nWhat caused him to pass away? “Unfortunately, the doctors didn’t know. It was as if his life was slowly taken away from him one day.”\n\nHow did you meet? – “I followed him to church every day, until one day he noticed me. We decided to skip the service and have a meal instead. It was love at first sight.”\n\nGrandma, do you see grandpa anymore? – She paused. “Only his shadow,” she muttered to herself. Looking down, she left the room. I wanted to ask more questions, but I took the impression that maybe I asked too many.\n\nShe re-entered the room, but with a smile. “I still have some of his belongings, if you would like, you can take a look at them.” We had spent the entire day admiring his hobbies and crafts. She even let me borrow some of his clothes, the ones that fit anyway. Lots of different sizes, but the man wore very similar clothing. A red-striped, white long-sleeve shirt, and some brown slacks. The day had grown long, and it was once again time for bed. I can sleep here for one more night, I told myself. Then I can go home.\n\nThat evening, as I was trying to sleep, I noticed that the screeching of the room above me had stopped happening. How has this noise haunted me all week, but not tonight. Curiously, I took a step out of bed to make my way towards the attic. As I took a step, I heard a step directly above me. Bizarre. It was the exact same position of the room. Another step forward, and another step above me. Each step out of the room, I heard above me.\n\nAs I entered the hallway, I decided to just get some water and return to bed. After all, the noise had stopped. I just need some sleep. When I returned down the hall, I opened the door back to my room and noticed it was no longer how I had left it. The bed I was sleeping in was missing. The bedside table, gone. No, it was as the attic was. I walked forward towards the scratch marks on the ground to notice that they were missing.\n\nLooking up, I saw a shadow. It did not move. It did not speak. As I gazed upon the shadow, it felt like the world was slowly pulling back towards me. My throat began to scratch. No, it begun to close. I could barely inhale as a tightness grew over my neck. Eventually, all the air was pulled out of my lungs. I was lifted into the air. My body started to become limp as I could feel it slowly rocking. Was there somebody pushing me? As I was slowly asphyxiating, I noticed I was losing perception on the world around me. The walls begin to blur, and then ultimately disappear. My body rocking, slowly, back and forth. My feet dangled onto the ground slowly creasing against it. I could once again here the scratching sound as I realized it matched the rhythm of my body rocking and my feet slowly dragging against the floor. Before I fell into darkness, I looked once more around and noticed that even the floors were losing the form. I could see through them. Below me was my little brother looking upward. Listening curiously to the creaky rhythm of the house above him."},"741":{"title":"Looking for a creepypasta podcast!

I've been in a coma since four days ago after a motorcycle accident that happened. I won't get into the crazy details but I was being stupid and racing on the highway with some friends and before I knew it, my bike started a death-wobble and thats all I remember.\n\nI would practice 'astral projecting' as a form of meditation in the past and would picture a rope above my bed and envision my astral body pulling at it to lift me from my body. I never succeeded. Maybe that's why I am back in my room after the crash? \n\nI can't leave my room either. It's like when I try, I get this overwhelming feeling of dread like I just walked into a room with someone pointing a gun at me. I feel as though if I leave my room, I will die. So here I am. Asking for advice or if anyone else has ever had this experiance. I know how far-fetched this must sound.\n\nOh and there seems to be something following me. When ever I move to another spot in my room, I can see a dark figure above me for a brief moment. As if they couldn't predict my next move and so they were delayed in hiding themselves. If I move my head fast in any direction I see this dark outline but if I THINK about moving my head and then do it, I don't see anything. So I kind of have to surprise it. Anyways, I saw its eyes once. I laid down really fast after getting up from my chair and in a big motion laid down. It has eyes... Big white eyes in this black void of a shadow. Almost like something is sitting on my shoulders.\n\nI tried to use my phone to text loved ones to let them know but it wont detect my fingers on the screen. Reddit was one of the only social medias that were logged in on my pc and so here I am. Any advice? I just wanna come home.

The darkness is real. It's eating away at my sight, piece by piece.\n\nLast night, I woke up to find my vision had narrowed to a tiny pinprick. I was surrounded by an inky blackness that seemed to pulse with a malevolent life of its own.

Don't enroll for that course from that influencer. Don't join the army. Don't take that plunge off the highest bridge just yet. Do not \"crash out\" as you all like to say. You don't have to kill yourself; I have hope for you. \n\nCapitalism, Communism, Feminism, the rise of Andrew Tate: the cause does not matter. The fate of young men today is misery, and it's plastered on every youth's face. And no one has a solution for it. No one cares. \n\nExcept me.\n\n\n\nYoung man, I offer you the chance to work for me. I will treat you even better than my previous employer treated me, for not too long ago I was just like you. \n\nPoor.\n\nLonely.\n\nLost.\n\nNow, I have my hands full of\n\nMoney.\n\nWomen.\n\nPurpose.\n\nI just had to accept a job from someone named Mogvaz Main.\n\n\n\nI grew up in the foster care system after my parents abandoned me at ten. No warning. No last goodbyes. They just left. \n\n\n\nThere were eight of us in the home, and that day at 14, I enjoyed some rare alone time in my room, which I shared with four other boys. There were only two beds in the room, small things that we were too old for, with Finding Nemo bed sheets none of us wanted. \n\n\n\nDJ barged into our room, ruining my rare alone time. I didn't bother looking up from the game on my PSP. I didn't care for the game; it was just a free demo I played again and again. I couldn't afford anything new.\n\n\n\nThe indentations on my fingers grew past painful over the hours I played and went into numbness. A numbness that I didn't mind because I was numb as well. I played the same game for the same reason I woke up in the morning. What else was there to do? I clicked and shuffled my fingers across the analog stick and listened to the game's music, which rotated between cheap imitations of Lil Wayne or cheap imitations of Linkin Park.\n\nThe game was boring, impossible to advance in, and hurt to the point of banality; that was my life.\n\nUntil DJ put a gun to my head.\n\n\n\n\"Sup, Darren,\" he said with a grin of poorly brushed teeth, only his dead mother could love.\n\nI froze but it was odd; before that, I paused the game, even in my panicked state. The game was dumb, but it was normality; some part of me wanted to return to it.\n\n\"DJ, dude, get that out of my face,\" I said. He did. Flashing grins the whole time and then going into several gun-shooting poses.\n\n\"DJ, where did you get a gun?\"\n\n\"Frank.\" He spit out the words; he always talked fast when he was excited. \"He doesn't know it though. It'll be back tonight though after we use it.\"\n\nI put my PSP down on the bed and stood up to get out of the gun's range.\n\n\"For what?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're about to rob one of those rich Wall Street pricks.\"\n\nDJ hated everyone on Wall Street, well, and everyone on every other street, I suppose. DJ's dad blamed Wall Street for all his woes and also beat DJ before he was taken from his dad and placed into foster care, where beatings continued by our foster dad: Frank. Violence begat violence fear begat fear and hatred begat hatred.\n\n\"If he's from Wall Street, what's he doing here?\" I asked. \n\n\"I don't know, but look at this flyer.\" He showed me a flyer made of thick, expensive-looking paper and shook it in front of me, then read me its content. \" 'Looking for Young Entrepreneurial men willing to work hard to achieve goals'; that's a whole bunch of nothing. He's about to scam everyone there.\"\n\nI held the flyer in my hand. That was my future in my hand, in one way or another. I would either rob the man with DJ or be one of these young men. It was exciting. It was like the indentations in my thumbs popped away. My hand cramps left.\n\nFinally, there would be change.\n\nI looked to DJ standing above me. He was furious and muttered something about Wall Street scum. \n\nI sighed and hugged him. Only here would my brother accept my love for him. Only here was he free to cry and admit he didn't know where Wall Street was, or wasn't even truly upset at them but he hated how weak his father, Frank, and the rest of the world made him feel.\n\nMy brother put his cheek on my shoulder, wetting my sleeve, and with only slight disappointment did I know my decision that night would be to rob the host of the party. Where DJ would go, I would go.\n\nThe procedure to get there was strange and lengthy. We each called in and answered about twenty or so questions about goals and experience.\n\n\"Bull, I'm telling you...,\" DJ said after the call. \"If you had real experience, you wouldn't be applying for something this sketchy. They want to make you think you're special but you're not. You're another hustle.\" \n\nPerhaps he was right. Both DJ and I were called back. We were told to meet outside of the local high school at 6 pm that fall night. That scared me. I was always afraid of the dark as a child. When my parents abandoned me in my house, the light bill hadn't been paid for days, so I sat in the dark just waiting for them to come back. Every noise at night made me shiver. Every gust of wind that beat against the window made me leap. Even all those years later, just a simple walk in the dark would give me goosebumps. I didn't want to go anymore. I hoped our foster dad would deny us permission to go, but he didn't care once he heard there was potential we could be getting paid.\n\nOnce there, the atmosphere was of subdued mockery. There were perhaps about sixteen boys from all years of high school to a few who just graduated. Like DJ, about a quarter of the boys felt that the whole thing was a joke and mocked those who put on their best suits.\n\nDJ did wear a black suit though, as did I. Certainly, not good enough; both were ill-fitting, ill-stitched, and the coloration on the jacket and pants was off. However, we hoped wearing suits would help us blend in for the robbery.\n\nA long, black, limo with tinted windows pulled in front of us. We waited for words from the driver or some sort of acknowledgment. It did not come. DJ, set on his mission, went into the limo first, and we followed.\n\nLuxury never rolled into my town. We didn't know about seats you could melt into. Seats that were heated and cars with enough space to stretch your legs without having to feel the sticky hairy legs of your companion. The limo had all of that.\n\nOnce all were in, the door closed, and the driver we couldn't see pulled away. We were anxious, excited, and rambunctious but somehow all 16 of us fell asleep in only a couple of minutes by magic or science.\n\nMy eyes fluttered awake from sleep so good the Sandman had already left his crumbs around me. I awoke to a quarter-moon night.\n\nThe limo's headlights flashed on a fluttering gate-sized red curtain as if we were about to enter a Broadway play too exquisite, too pristine for the rest of us. I rubbed my waking eyes and every boy sat in reversed silence.\n\nMen in suits much greater than ours stood in the center of the curtain. They were mountainous and built like bodybuilders. With all the strength required of their bulk, they pulled apart the curtains and the car rolled in. Behind the curtain were suburban houses more valuable than any in our town.\n\nWithout a word, the limo came to a stop.\n\n\"Excuse me, Sir. Do we get out here?\" A skittish boy named Reggie asked. His resume flapped in his shaky hand and his voice cracked.\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"I think we should,\" said one of the older boys, Jerry, who graduated high school already. I knew he was going deaf because of his job at the factory. Jerry only came in a collared shirt and khakis, and I could tell he was regretting it. He had the disposition of a man who had fumbled an opportunity; sighs of disappointment, downtrodden shoulders, and constant curses under his breath.\n\nHe led us out, putting on a brave face because every boy in there was frightened.\n\nThe neighborhood was lit like a bizarre and beautiful Halloween night. Outside of each home stood a man in a suit or a beautiful woman in black. They stood, still at attention, and held candles in front of their faces.\n\nIt was repeated down and down the numerous rows and houses. Orange light was the only light, for each house was pitch black.\n\nAs a group, we went to the house closest to us. It was manned by another strong man. He was perhaps just under seven feet, had dark hair to his shoulders, and dark caramel skin.\n\n\"Hello, Sir,\" said our leader, the oldest and worst dressed of us. \"We're here for the meeting.\" \n\n\"I know,\" the tall man said with disdain and a judging gaze. \"Each of you take a bag.\" He said and stepped aside to reveal a pile of brown-leather handbags with markings of LV, LV, and LV on them.\n\n\"I ain't grabbing a purse,\" said Tim, a rough kid, short, red-haired, and anxious to prove himself. However, he hadn't quite hopped on to current trends and didn't see what we saw in rock and rap music videos. The superstars all had these bags and they were worth $11,000 each. \n\n\"Then go sit in the car,\" the man barked back.\n\nThis stunned Tim and he stuttered a dumb reply. \"N--n-no, I was just joking.\"\n\nTim stood at the back of the crowd and the big man waved through it. We scattered out of fear. He didn't lay a hand on us and we parted. The man grabbed Tim by his throat. The smack of a hand on a throat pushed timidity out of the night and fear entered. Tim's gasp for air sounded like a dying coyote's final howls. This man raised Tim -crying, flailing, and wetting himself- with only that quarter moon in the background. I got the impression that we were well and truly alone.\n\nThe laws of the U. S. did not apply here.\n\nThe police and their sirens would not whir to his aid.\n\nHis daddy's sawed-off shotgun couldn't shoot far enough to harm this man. We were somewhere too distant.\n\nAnd none of us boys would dare help him.\n\nThe man roared. Well and truly a savage tribute to what a man can be. It shook me to my core.\n\n\"Do I look like I make demands twice?!\" the man said.\n\nAnd with that, he dropped him. The ground thudded with the new arrival and it shocked me back to consciousness. I noted my position on the ground, all of our positions on the ground; it was like we were bowing to this man. This put a deeper fear in me and jealousy.\n\nTo be bowed down to...\n\nTo have no one look down on you... \n\nTim rose with a neck with a slight bend and ran to the car.\n\n\"The bags...\" the giant said and we followed his orders, rushing to grab one.\n\n\"You are to receive a gift at each house and at each house, there's the possibility you may go home.\"\n\nWe huddled together and moved like sheep. \n\n\"Split up!\" he demanded. \"Two-by-two.\" \n\nWe burst from the scene; DJ and I found one another and headed to the house furthest from him. \n\n\"Little prick,\" DJ whispered to me out of breath. \"He'll kill us all if he gets the chance.\" \n\n\"I don't know about that, DJ. I really think we ought to see how this goes before we make any wrong moves.\" \n\n\"When you've got the gun, you can't make a wrong move,\" DJ said through gritted teeth. \n\nOur arrival at a new house paused the conversation. This was manned by a woman who held that same orange candle with one hand and beckoned us with the other.\n\nWe obeyed and I begged myself to look bold, older, and more confident. We left the street for the sidewalk and I saw more of her beauty. My heart raced, my palms sweated, and I realized I'd do anything to be around this woman. She was that beautiful.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, her black lipstick matched her hair. \"How are you all tonight?\" \n\n\"We're good,\" DJ said. I couldn't find my voice yet. \n\n\"Really?\" she said as if surprised. \"Everyone's treated you well?\" She squatted to our height and poked her lip out to speak to us in a nurturing manner, so much more electrifying than a mother ever could.\n\nThis could be a conversation topic. Couldn't she see what just happened? She heard the screams. She heard the howls. I'll help report him and--\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" DJ said. I was pissed and I was ready to argue until I saw the change in her face from the care-taker to gleeful grave-digger. \n\n\"Good boys,\" she said and then pointed at me. \"This one almost spilled though.\" She laughed. I blushed and swayed, confused and self-conscious. She laughed hard and the candle's flame shook with her body. \"Make sure you stay with him if you want to make it to the end. Now, how about some iPhones? Careful with these; they won't hit the market for a year.\" \n\nWe took her advice and she dropped the latest iPhones in our bags ( a thing so rare in our town I had never seen them in person). Trick or treat, I guess. \n\n\"Goodbye,\" I said. My first and last words to the woman that night. We would meet again another day. \n\nShe mouthed the words goodbye and my heart fluttered in confusion and young lust at first sight.\n\n\"You see that?\" DJ said. \"They want us to lie; that means something fishy is going on here. We need to rob this guy, steal a car, and get out of here GTA style. I got the ski mask.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we could make it to the end.\"\n\n\"How?\" he said. \"When have we been picked for anything? You couldn't even graduate 7th grade on the first try; why would we get picked for this?\" \n\n\"Maybe, it wasn't all smart stuff. Maybe some of it was normal guy stuff,\" I said; my voice trailed off as I saw a woman just as beautiful at the next table. My young mind already imagining my future with this one if I could just find the right words. \n\n\"They don't have normal guy stuff here,\" DJ said. Then our attention turned to our left. The older boy in the collared shirt, Jerry, was making a ruckus.\n\nHe begged at one of the tables of the beautiful women.\n\n\"Please,\" he said. \"I understand I am not wearing a suit. I might not be exactly up to code... but please let me stay.\"\n\n\"The instructions were business attire, not business casual,\" the model said. \n\n\"I have better clothes.\"\n\n\"We want the best. Now, can I please get your bag and all of its supplies?\" the model asked in a childish voice that would be seductive to some men if not for the occasion.\n\n\"I-i-i don't have a job. You don't understand; I could really use this money.\"\n\nThe model was stunned, his objection an impossible rebellion to her. \n\n\"Can I come back?\" he asked.\n\n\"I said, 'give it back'. Why isn't it in my hand?\"\n\nThe oldest boy dropped to his knees and put his hands together for prayer. \n\nDisturbed by his lack of acquiescence, a large suited man charged him. \n\n\"Jerry!\" I cried out! \n\n\"Jerry!\" \n\n\"Jerry!\" \n\nSo many of us warned, but like I said earlier, he was going deaf. The suite\n\nSo many of us warned, but like I said earlier, he was going deaf. The suited man stomped, boomed, and tore through the night. He struck Jerry like lightning meets the ground, and Jerry's body folded over.\n\nHis skull split open. I didn't know such a small thing could be so loud. The sound reverberated in my chest and my heart dropped. I wanted my world to go still but it erupted instead.\n\nBoys who watched Al-Qaeda beheadings for fun now screamed for God like they were the religious ones.\n\nBlood pooled out from his skull.\n\nCandle-lit women sucked their teeth and rolled their eyes.\n\nWitnesses vomited.\n\nThe murderer rose. No blood touched his clothes.\n\n\"You told him to leave,\" he said defensively.\n\n\"You killed him!\" one boy cried.\n\n\"Yeah?\" the murderer roared. \"And I'll do worse to you if you don't go to the car.\"\n\nDJ pulled me by my collar and dragged me behind a bush. I let him take the lead; my consciousness was drowning in that pool of blood. He pulled off my jacket, put a ski mask over himself and me, then placed a gun in my hand.\n\n\"Follow me,\" he said and we raced through the neighborhood while dead Jerry held the neighborhood's attention. We found where DJ assumed riches must lie.\n\nIt was a cul-de-sac and the end of it was another red curtain.\n\n\"You ready?\" DJ asked.\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\n\"Man, get ready. You don't have to feel bad for these guys. They're scum. They killed, Jerry, and I've got an odd feeling they'll kill us tonight if we let 'em.\"\n\n\"Okay...\" I realized that night I did not want to die at all.\n\nWe entered through the final red curtain.\n\nIt was a drainage pool of black sewer water. A massive intimidating thing as large as a basketball court. Outlining this pool was freshly manicured grass, and as still as statues stood, again, the beautiful, the perfect, lit only by orange candlelight.\n\nThe pool water stirred. Something in it swam in a circle. My heart raced, I was not a thief; I couldn't do this but I acted out of fear-wretched self-preservation. I waved my gun and begged:\n\n\"Wallets, jewelry, now!\" I said.\n\nThey ignored me. Something in the pool swam toward us. I swear my hand was uneasy on the trigger. \"Now!\" I demanded.\n\nEyes rose from the pool, yellow eyes, the eyes of a crocodile.\n\nA tail rose next with a mighty splash. It was long as an anaconda but bent like a cobra. It slammed on the grass and from it came words, for the tail had 5 mouths with hairy tongues.\n\nIt should have been funny. I should have been laughing, not crying, but I wanted to go home because I was so afraid. I pissed myself then and there. Warm liquid dribbled down my leg. It reeked and I couldn't stop it.\n\n\"A robbery?” The thing in the pool said. Each word came out from one mouth at a time like a note from a demonic clarinet.  “Now, that's innovation,\" the witnesses around us laughed at the joke. \"I'm Mograz Main. I run this organization. I like your style you’re hired. What's your name?\"\n\n\"I'm not giving names; I'm robbing you!\"\n\n\"Kid,\" Mogvaz said. \"I like you. You won, put the gun down, you and your buddy will work for me.\"\n\n\"No! I don't want a job. I want your money.\"\n\n\"Kid, I'll show you more money than you'll ever believe. The money, the cars, the clothes; it's here if you put the gun down and listen.\"\n\nI didn't speak. I didn't want to speak. My mouth was so dry and I was becoming aware of my shame. And I was remembering. I remembered how I was so alone and so scared as a child in that cold dark house. I was more confused at that moment than then. It was horrible. I was small, cold, and defenseless.\n\n\"No, more talking,\" DJ bellowed. \"Start tossing your wallets and jewelry or I shoot!\"\n\n\"Kid!\" Mogvaz said. \"You shoot me, I kill you and your friend.\"\n\n\"You can't fool me. You're killing me anyway.\"\n\n\"Awww, you're a nut case; you're going to get you and your friend killed.\"\n\n\"Money now!\"\n\n\"Go to hell!\"\n\nThen DJ made the worst decision of his life. He shot three times into the skull of the yellow-eyed creature.\n\nSplash\n\nSplash\n\nSplash\n\nThe water settled. Mogvaz only blinked.\n\nFlick.\n\nFlick.\n\nFlick.\n\nThe first time the lights went off and I was all alone, I stood by the light for half an hour trying to get it to work. It was so futile, like fighting against Mogvaz.\n\nAs I said before, violence begat violence, fear begat fear. Just as DJ struck out against everything because his dad beat him, I would abandon my friend because I was afraid of being alone and defenseless.\n\nI shot my best friend, my brother, in the back of his head. He plopped down first, landing on his knees and then his face met the grass.\n\nI didn't say anything. My gun was hot and smoke leaked from it. I tossed it aside, disgusted with my choice but I didn't leave; I wanted my prize.\n\n\"Finally, someone who's smart,\" the mouths said. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"All of it. Everything you were offering him.\"\n\n\"And you'll do anything for it, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Get on your knees and roll his body forward into the river and stay on your knees.\"\n\nI rolled his body forward. His bloody head left a trail in the grass. I tried to separate myself from what I did. I tried to let my thoughts leave my body. I focused on the task and not that I was throwing the hands that I shook, the arms that hugged me, the body of my brother into the water.\n\nIt did not work. I moved to the sewer water's edge and rolled the body in the water. \n\nThe body plopped in the water and floated toward Mogvaz.\n\nUsing whatever mouth that lay beneath those eyes, Mogvaz tore through the body of my brother and made the black water red. He was efficient. More controlled than a beast; there were no brilliant splashes or writhing. I didn't even get splashed with sewer water.\n\nAnd yet I was still filthy.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of eating, the body disappeared and only clothes were left.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Mogvaz asked.\n\n\"Darren.\"\n\n\"You will do whatever I want? No matter what I ask? Because this is the job. You will feed us the bodies of men and women. You will betray many more, Darren.\"\n\n\"You'll give me whatever I want, Mogvaz?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I agree, but first I need to know... There's always a cost. Will you want to eat me by the end of this?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How long? How long will I have?\"\n\n\"Ten years. A decade.\"\n\n\"I'll have a decade to do whatever I want.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I accept.\"\n\nAnd for ten years, I got everything I wanted.\n\nI had so much fun I had to tell someone. So, I hired a therapist. That therapist quit so I hired another. That one quit so I went to a priest. Then the priest quit and wanted to work for me. He wanted some of the diamonds, the blondes, the Bugattis, the power, the freedom, the Latinas, the boats, the affairs, the islands, the wars, and wins.\n\nHowever, I kept the world at arm's length. It's hard to form bonds as a human trafficker. I saw my fellow men as cattle. Everyone I got close to I ended up betraying to feed Mograz and his friends.\n\nAnd they would take their time on a human. They had perfected limb-by-limb surgery. Men and women would die for days, first stripped of feet or merely toes for the younger members who were learning to eat their fellow men. They were all humans though, other than Mogvaz.\n\nAnyway, they had perfected the process of preventing a body from ever bleeding out. A human would be severed and alive until only the torso, neck, and head were left. The first couple of years, part of my job was to make sure they remained conscious and lucid and that they did not go insane but stayed in reality. Some cried for death, some cried for mercy with each chopped limb. In a way, it was granted.\n\nOn the last day of my service, I delivered a human baby to Mogvaz Main. It was something he had never had before. The other members felt that it was too cruel and argued the taste would be poor in quality, so he asked me to do this.\n\nIt was my child. The mother, Lena, was one of the models with the candles I met on that first night. Over the years, we had grown close, both of us coming to the end of our contracts and wanting something more, something that money couldn't buy; each other. Mogvaz saw this and requested we go on another grand adventure...pregnancy. It was business. What's one more human life to give to Mogvaz?\n\nSomething changed once our baby popped out, quiet and beautiful with his mother's nose and father's eyes. When Lena held him, she had never been so euphoric. Name your drug, name your vice, we've done it and this for her was better than all of that, just sitting in her robe and holding her baby to her chest.\n\nFor a moment, I felt it too - but I knew to push that down. I knew eventually both that baby and Lena would abandon me and I would be alone again, so what was the point of stalling?\n\nThe next day, I tried to take the baby from her.\n\nWhat followed was a blur of screams and tears. We fought, she was animalistic, driven by desperation. She forgot what we were. She forgot we were all just meat puppets and none of it mattered!\n\nIn our struggle, the god of irony mocked us. Our son, less than a week old, slipped from our grasp.\n\nThe thud-like sound he made when he hit the ground did make me sick. It echoed in my ears so much louder than Lena's anguished wails.\n\nI stood there, frozen, a smile cracking across my icy grimace. Our son lay still, silent. In trying to save him, we'd become his executioners.\n\nWith my dead child cradled in my arms, I entered Mogvaz's office. Each step tormented me and I was ready for this to be over. I was ready to die. But as I crossed the threshold, I was met with an emptiness that broke me. Mogvaz was gone.\n\nI stood there, in disbelief, my eyes darted around the room for any sign of his presence. But there was nothing. No trace of my master for over a decade. Mogvaz Main had gone home, wherever that may be.\n\n\"Mogvaz?\" I called out, my voice echoed in the empty space. \"MOGVAZ!\" I screamed, desperation clawing at my throat.\n\nBut I knew, with a sickening certainty, that I would never find him again. Mogvaz Main had abandoned me.\n\nI screamed. This wasn't fair. I needed to be eaten. I needed to be eaten by him. I needed someone cruel, and ruthless, who saw me as the worthless cattle I was. None of those other frauds could eat me as I desired, as I needed.\n\nIt all came back to me, all the guilt I pushed down. I pushed down the vomit and let out the tears and in the freedom, the vomit came and my legs collapsed to the floor. The lies, the loneliness, the knives, the blood, the drownings, the broken homes, the fires, the slaves, it all came back to me.\n\nDJ, my brother. I still hadn't met anyone like him. You can't replace a brother.\n\nMy son. I sacrificed my son for what?\n\nFor nothing. I needed penance and it dawned on me there was a way.\n\n'I could eat myself,' I whispered, the words tasting of madness and despair. 'Why not?'\n\nI recalled the meticulous process Mogvaz and his kind had perfected - the surgical precision with which they kept their victims alive and conscious as they devoured them piece by piece. I had watched it countless times, had even assisted in the gruesome act. Now, it seemed fitting that I should experience it firsthand.\n\nI could eat myself. Why not? They had perfected the process of chopping a body and keeping it alive. If I wanted a monster to eat my flesh, why could I not do it?\n\nAfter the first surgery, I felt a perverse sense of justice and purpose. This was my punishment, my atonement. And unlike my victims, I had chosen this fate. I was better than them. I wasn't a victim alone in the dark scrambling for the lights to turn on. I was in control.\n\nI pen my tale with one hand, a torso, and a head. I'll stop here.\n\nYoung man, I ask you if you want to travel the world and experience everything good in life. If you don't want to be a victim and take control over your life, come apply for a position with me. I promise you I won't abandon you as Mogvaz Main abandoned [me](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Finchink\/comments\/1f3gxsu\/what_happened_to_mogvaz_main\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)."},"749":{"title":"16 body's","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3ca5t\/16_bodys\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Superb_Flatworm_1312","selftext":"I Wasn't planning on telling this story, and honestly I had forgotten about it for years. But I saw something on the news recently that made my skin crawl ,and I couldn't get it out of my head, but I'm getting ahead of myself. When I was younger, maybe like 15 or 16 I used to walk in the woods. I really liked Watching horror movies and scary stuff like that so walking in the woods Didn't really scare me, my parents however didn't see it that way, they hated that I Went in the woods. Where I lived there were a lot of disappearances and some kids just didn't come home. But those story's only made me want to know what happened and try to figure out where they went and one day…I found it. I was walking in the woods deeper than I had ever gone before, and I came across a rundown house. It kind of looked like a resort but nobody had been there for years. At least that's what I thought. I walked inside to explore it, and I could hear baing. I got a little bit scared but I continued looking around, until I got to a door. It looked like it had been freshly painted a very Nice dark blue color,I was hesitant to open it but the noises were getting louder and I was getting curious.It reminds me of that phrase curiosity killed the cat,Of course at this point I wasn't thinking about that. I quietly opened the door and Started slowly walking down the steps. The noises that I was hearing I can actually see now,It was a frail little girl she looked younger than I was, her hair was dark and matted and the Her clothes Were  stained, I ducked my head so She hopefully couldn't see me and.realized that she Was cutting apples, There were a bunch of Pies sitting on the table next to her. And then I heard a man's voice it sounded like he had smoked all his life, and it only had cottoned on to him recently. He called for the girl to bring him a pie.So she grabbed one of them sitting next to her, And  before she could get to the man she dropped it. She looked frightened visibly ,And without thinking I ran down the stairs and helped her pick it up. She looked at me Tears willing in her eyes and quietly Whispered “are you real ,are you alive”I nodded my head yes. She looked confused But before she could say anything I heard someone else or rather something else,I turned my head and saw a person but I could see through him.He told me that he was trapped here, that he couldn't leave. He told me the horrible things that he went through. Things that are too gruesome and horrible to explain here, And then he told me that he was…dead, When he said that I remembered something I had seen this guy before he was one of the kids that had gone missing his name was David ,David also liked going for walks in the woods. and we had talked once or twice. A few months ago he went missing and nobody understood where he went.His parents knew it was because of the Woods but we lived in a small town ,and nobody cared enough to check it out. They declared him missing ,months went by And he never came home.David told me that I should go run as far away as I can and never look back. but I couldn't just leave what about the girl, Before I can tell him this I Heard a Voice .the man's voice It had been a couple minutes and because the girl dropped his pie he was angry, He got up and started walking towards me and the girl.she Whispered to me “Run or you'll be trapped here like me and David” and Stop thinking I grabbed her hand pulled her up onto her feet and we ran up the stairs, I could hear the man running after us.we got upstairs  and ran through the abandoned Resort, we got outside and ran through the trees almost hitting a couple. and we ran all the way back into the street,it was dark at this point and I couldn't hear the man behind us anymore.The street lights were dim and We were both scared, We ran back to my house. And When we got there  we saw a bunch of police Cars outside. and as soon as my Mom saw me she ran and hugged me as tight as she could. She asked where I was, and I told her the whole story. and then I had to tell the cops the same story,and I explained why I had a little girl with me. why her hair was matted and why there were   stains on her Close. she told the cops everything she knows well Including her name Rosie and they ended up going into the woods  they found the Abandoned Resort and look through the whole house they ended up finding 15 bodies in the basement including an elderly man and 14 child bodies That were too Horrifically modified to describe to the public If they were the missing kids all Of them. except for one, they never found David's body. It's been years since that day, and me and Rosie are still very close. they never really could make sense of what happened all those years ago, until a couple weeks ago Some kids were running around in the woods that I Used to walk through of course after all this happened my parents Forbade me from ever going in the woods again and I wasn't too keen on going back  either The kids came across an old abandoned Resort and we're walking around it to see if they could find anything cool it had been longboarded up and they couldn't find a way in but they saw a hole in the ground it and didn't look fresh there was grass and leaves and all sorts of stuff on top but they  dug it up and found a skeleton. ran out of the woods and called the Cops, and when they went back to the resort and found a very Decayed skeleton. They couldn't determine much Other than it was a teenage boy around 13 to 16,But I knew I knew it was him it had to be David. I've been thinking of going back there for the summer to see my parents and maybe go back into the woods to see if I can find anything any answers as to what happened all those years ago.\n\n"},"750":{"title":"No updates till tomorrow ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3pune\/no_updates_till_tomorrow\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"nabletobeme","selftext":"Sorry had some issues come up "},"751":{"title":"A Concise Guide to Surviving the Cursed Woods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3g2z6\/a_concise_guide_to_surviving_the_cursed_woods\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"scare_in_a_box","selftext":"There are two rules you must always adhere to in order to survive in this forest.\n\n1. Never get into a situation where there is no light\n\n2. Only the sunlight can be trusted\n\nThat was what the legends said when they spoke of the infamous Umbra Woods. I tried doing some research before my trip, but I couldn't find much information other than those two rules that seemed to crop up no matter what forum or website I visited. I wasn't entirely sure what the second one meant, but it seemed to be important that I didn't find myself in darkness during my trip, so I packed two flashlights with extra batteries, just to be on the safe side. \n\nI already had the right gear for camping in the woods at night, since this was far from my first excursion into strange, unsettling places. I followed legends and curses like threads, eager to test for myself if the stories were true or nothing more than complex, fabricated lies.\n\nThe Umbra Woods had all manner of strange tales whispered about it, but the general consensus was that the forest was cursed, and those who found themselves beneath the twisted canopy at night met with eerie, unsettling sights and unfortunate ends. A string of people had already disappeared in the forest, but it was the same with any location I visited. Where was the fun without the danger?\n\nI entered the woods by the light of dawn. It was early spring and there was still a chill in the air, the leaves and grass wet with dew, a light mist clinging to the trees. The forest seemed undisturbed at this time, not fully awake. Cobwebs stretched between branches, glimmering like silver thread beneath the sunlight, and the leaves were still. It was surprisingly peaceful, if a little too quiet.\n\nI'd barely made it a few steps into the forest when I heard footsteps snaking through the grass behind me. I turned around and saw a young couple entering the woods after me, clad in hiking gear and toting large rucksacks on their backs. They saw me and the man lifted his hand in a polite wave. \"Are you here to investigate the Umbra Woods too?\" he asked, scratching a hand through his dark stubble.\n\nI nodded, the jagged branches of a tree pressing into my back. \"I like to chase mysteries,\" I supplied in lieu of explanation. \n\n\"The forest is indeed very mysterious,\" the woman said, her blue eyes sparkling like gems. \"What do you think we'll find here?\"\n\nI shrugged. I wasn't looking for anything here. I just wanted to experience the woods for myself, so that I might better understand the rumours they whispered about. \n\n\"Why don't we walk together for a while?\" the woman suggested, and since I didn't have a reason not to, I agreed.\n\nWe kept the conversation light as we walked, concentrating on the movement of the woods around us. I wasn't sure what the wildlife was like here, but I had caught snatches of movement amongst the undergrowth while walking. I had yet to glimpse anything more than scurrying shadows though.\n\nThe light waned a little in the darker, thicker areas of the forest, but never faded, and never consigned us to darkness. In some places, where the canopy was sparse and the grey sunlight poured through, the grass was tall and lush. Other places were bogged down with leaf-rot and mud, making it harder to traverse.\n\nAt midday, we stopped for lunch. Like me, the couple had brought canteens of water and a variety of energy bars and trail mix to snack on. I retrieved a granola bar from my rucksack and chewed on it while listening to the tree bark creak in the wind. \n\nWhen I was finished, I dusted the crumbs off my fingers and watched the leaves at my feet start trembling as things crept out to retrieve what I'd dropped, dragging them back down into the earth. I took a swig of water from my flask and put it away again. I'd brought enough supplies to last a few days, though I only intended on staying one night. But places like these could become disorientating and difficult to leave sometimes, trapping you in a cage of old, rotten bark and skeletal leaves.\n\n\"Left nothing behind?\" the man said, checking his surroundings before nodding. \"Right, let's get going then.\" I did the same, making sure I hadn't left anything that didn't belong here, then trailed after them, batting aside twigs and branches that reached towards me across the path.\n\nSomething grabbed my foot as I was walking, and I looked down, my heart lurching at what it might be. An old root had gotten twisted around my ankle somehow, spidery green veins snaking along my shoes. I shook it off, being extra vigilant of where I was putting my feet. I didn't want to fall into another trap, or hurt my foot by stepping somewhere I shouldn't. \n\n\"We're going to go a bit further, and then make camp,\" the woman told me over her shoulder, quickly looking forward again when she stumbled. \n\nWe had yet to come across another person in the forest, and while it was nice to have some company, I'd probably separate from them when they set up camp. I wasn't ready to stop yet. I wanted to go deeper still. \n\nA small clearing parted the trees ahead of us; an open area of grass and moss, with a small darkened patch of ground in the middle from a previous campfire. \n\nNearby, I heard the soft trickle of water running across the ground. A stream?\n\n\"Here looks like a good place to stop,\" the man observed, peering around and testing the ground with his shoe. The woman agreed.\n\n\"I'll be heading off now,\" I told them, hoisting my rucksack as it began to slip down off my shoulder.\n\n\"Be careful out there,\" the woman warned, and I nodded, thanking them for their company and wishing them well. \n\nIt was strange walking on my own after that. Listening to my own footsteps crunching through leaves sounded lonely, and I almost felt like my presence was disturbing something it shouldn't. I tried not to let those thoughts bother me, glancing around at the trees and watching the sun move across the sky between the canopy. The time on my cellphone read 15:19, so there were still several hours before nightfall. I had planned on seeing how things went before deciding whether to stay overnight or leave before dusk, but since nothing much had happened yet, I was determined to keep going. \n\nI paused a few more times to drink from my canteen and snack on some berries and nuts, keeping my energy up. During one of my breaks, the tree on my left began to tremble, something moving between the sloping boughs. I stood still and waited for it to reveal itself, the frantic rustling drawing closer, until a small bird appeared that I had never seen before, with black-tipped wings that seemed to shimmer with a dark blue fluorescence, and milky white eyes. Something about the bird reminded me of the sky at night, and I wondered what kind of species it was. As soon as it caught sight of me, it darted away, chirping softly. \n\nI thought about sprinkling some nuts around me to coax it back, but I decided against it. I didn't want to attract any different, more unsavoury creatures. If there were birds here I'd never seen before, then who knew what else called the Umbra Woods their home?\n\nGradually, daylight started to wane, and the forest grew dimmer and livelier at the same time. Shadows rustled through the leaves and the soil shifted beneath my feet, like things were getting ready to surface.\n\nIt grew darker beneath the canopy, gloom coalescing between the trees, and although I could still see fine, I decided to recheck my equipment. Pausing by a fallen log, I set down my bag and rifled through it for one of the flashlights.\n\nWhen I switched it on, it spat out a quiet, skittering burst of light, then went dark. I frowned and tried flipping it off and on again, but it didn't work. I whacked it a few times against my palm, jostling the batteries inside, but that did nothing either. Odd. I grabbed the second flashlight and switched it on, but it did the same thing. The light died almost immediately. I had put new batteries in that same morning—fresh from the packet, no cast-offs or half-drained ones. I'd even tried them in the village on the edge of the forest, just to make sure, and they had been working fine then. How had they run out of power already?\n\nGrumbling in annoyance, I dug the spare batteries out of my pack and replaced them inside both flashlights. \n\nI held my breath as I flicked on the switch, a sinking dread settling in the pit of my stomach when they still didn't work. Both of them were completely dead. What was I supposed to do now? I couldn't go wandering through the forest in darkness. The rules had been very explicit about not letting yourself get trapped with no light. \n\nI knew I should have turned back at that point, but I decided to stay. I had other ways of generating light—a fire would keep the shadows at bay, and when I checked my cellphone, the screen produced a faint glow, though it remained dim. At least the battery hadn't completely drained, like in the flashlights. Though out here, with no service, I doubted it would be very useful in any kind of situation.\n\nI walked for a little longer, but stopped when the darkness started to grow around me. Dusk was gathering rapidly, the last remnants of sunlight peeking through the canopy. I should stop and get a fire going, before I found myself lost in the shadows.\n\nI backtracked to an empty patch of ground that I'd passed, where the canopy was open and there were no overhanging branches or thick undergrowth, and started building my fire, stacking pieces of kindling and tinder in a small circle. Then I pulled out a match and struck it, holding the bright flame to the wood and watching it ignite, spreading further into the fire pit. \n\nWith a soft, pleasant crackle, the fire burned brighter, and I let out a sigh of relief. At least now I had something to ward off the darkness.\n\nBut as the fire continued to burn, I noticed there was something strange about it. Something that didn't make any sense. Despite all the flickering and snaking of the flames, there were no shadows cast in its vicinity. The fire burned almost as a separate entity, touching nothing around it.\n\nAs dusk fell and the darkness grew, it only became more apparent. The fire wasn't illuminating anything. I held my hand in front of it, feeling the heat lick my palms, but the light did not spread across my skin.\n\nWas that what was meant by the second rule? Light had no effect in the forest, unless it came from the sun? \n\nI watched a bug flit too close to the flames, buzzing quietly. An ember spat out of the mouth of the fire and incinerated it in the fraction of a second, leaving nothing behind.\n\nWhat was I supposed to do? If the fire didn't emit any light, did that mean I was in danger? The rumours never said what would happen if I found myself alone in the darkness, but the number of people who had gone missing in this forest was enough to make me cautious. I didn't want to end up as just another statistic. \n\nI had to get somewhere with light—real light—before it got full-dark. I was too far from the exit to simply run for it. It was safer to stay where I was.\n\nOnly the sunlight can be trusted.\n\nI lifted my gaze to the sky, clear between the canopy. The sun had already set long ago, but the pale crescent of the moon glimmered through the trees. If the surface of the moon was simply a reflection of the sun, did it count as sunlight? I had no choice at this point—I had to hope that the reasoning was sound.\n\nThe fire started to die out fairly quickly once I stopped feeding it kindling. While it fended off the chill of the night, it did nothing to hold the darkness back. I could feel it creeping around me, getting closer and closer. If it wasn't for the strands of thin, silvery moonlight that crept down onto the forest floor and basked my skin in a faint glow, I would be in complete darkness. As long as the moon kept shining on me, I should be fine.\n\nBut as the night drew on and the sky dimmed further, the canopy itself seemed to thicken, as if the branches were threading closer together, blocking out more and more of the moon's glow. If this continued, I would no longer be in the light. \n\nThe fire had shrunk to a faint flicker now, so I let it burn out on its own, a chill settling over my skin as soon as I got to my feet. I had to go where the moonlight could reach me, which meant my only option was going up. If I could find a nice nook of bark to rest in above the treeline, I should be in direct contact with the moonlight for the rest of the night. \n\nHoisting my bag onto my shoulders, I walked up to the nearest tree and tested the closest branch with my hand. It seemed sturdy enough to hold my weight while I climbed.\n\nTaking a deep breath of the cool night air, I pulled myself up, my shoes scrabbling against the bark in search of a proper foothold. Part of the tree was slippery with sap and moss, and I almost slipped a few times, the branches creaking sharply as I balanced all of my weight onto them, but I managed to right myself.\n\nSome of the smaller twigs scraped over my skin and tangled in my hair as I climbed, my backpack thumping against the small of my back. The tree seemed to stretch on forever, and just when I thought I was getting close to its crown, I would look up and find more branches above my head, as if the tree had sprouted more when I wasn't looking.\n\nFinally, my head broke through the last layer of leaves, and I could finally breathe now that I was free from the cloying atmosphere between the branches. I brushed pieces of dry bark off my face and looked around for somewhere to sit. \n\nThe moonlight danced along the leaves, illuminating a deep groove inside the tree, just big enough for me to comfortably sit.\n\nMy legs ached from the exertion of climbing, and although the bark was lumpy and uncomfortable, I was relieved to sit down. The bone-white moon gazed down on me, washing the shadows from my skin. \n\nAs long as I stayed above the treeline, I should be able to get through the night.\n\nIt was rather peaceful up here. I felt like I might reach up and touch the stars if I wanted to, their soft, twinkling lights dotting the velvet sky like diamonds. \n\nA wind began to rustle through the leaves, carrying a breath of frost, and I wished I could have stayed down by the fire; would the chill get me before the darkness could? I wrapped my jacket tighter around my shoulders, breathing into my hands to keep them warm. \n\nI tried to check my phone for the time, but the screen had dimmed so much that I couldn't see a thing. It was useless. \n\nWith a sigh, I put it away and nestled deeper into the tree, tucking my hands beneath my armpits to stay warm. Above me, the moon shone brightly, making the treetops glow silver. I started to doze, lulled into a dreamy state by the smiling moon and the rustling breeze. \n\nJust as I was on the precipice of sleep, something at the back of my mind tugged me awake—a feeling, perhaps an instinctual warning that something was going to happen. I lifted my gaze to the sky, and gave a start.\n\nA thick wisp of cloud was about to pass over the moon. If it blocked the light completely, wouldn't I be trapped in darkness? \n\n\"Please, change your direction!\" I shouted, my sudden loudness startling a bird from the tree next to me. \n\nPerhaps I was simply imagining it, in a sleep-induced haze, but the cloud stopped moving, only the very edge creeping across the moon. I blinked; had the cloud heard me?\n\nAnd then, in a tenuous, whispering voice, the cloud replied: \"Play with me then. Hide and seek.\"\n\nI watched in a mixture of amazement and bewilderment as the cloud began to drift downwards, towards the forest, in a breezy, elegant motion. It passed between the trees, leaving glistening wet leaves in its wake, and disappeared.\n\nI stared after it, my heart thumping hard in my chest. The cloud really had just spoken to me. But despite its wish to play hide and seek, I had no intention of leaving my treetop perch. Up here, I knew I was safe in the moonlight. At least now the sky had gone clear again, no more clouds threatening to sully the glow of the moon.\n\nAs long as the sky stayed empty and the moon stayed bright, I should make it until morning. I didn't know what time it was, but several hours must have passed since dusk had fallen. I started to feel sleepy, but the cloud's antics had put me on edge and I was worried something else might happen if I closed my eyes again.\n\nWhat if the cloud came back when it realized I wasn't actually searching for it? It was a big forest, so there was no guarantee I'd even manage to find it. Hopefully the cloud stayed hidden and wouldn't come back to threaten my safety again.\n\nI fought the growing heaviness in my eyes, the wind gently playing with my hair.\n\nAfter a while, I could no longer fight it and started to doze off, nestled by the creaking bark and soft leaves.\n\n\nI awoke sometime later in near-darkness.\n\nPanic tightened in my chest as I sat up, realizing the sky above me was empty. Where was the moon? \n\nI spied its faint silvery glow on the horizon, just starting to dip out of sight. But dawn was still a while away, and without the moon, I would have no viable light source. \"Where are you going?\" I called after the moon, not completely surprised when it answered me back.\n\nIts voice was soft and lyrical, like a lullaby, but its words filled me with a sinking dread. \"Today I'm only working half-period. Sorry~\"\n\nI stared in rising fear as the moon slipped over the edge of the horizon, the sky an impossibly-dark expanse above me. Was this it? Was I finally going to be swallowed by the shadowy forest? \n\nMy eyes narrowed closed, my heart thumping hard in my chest at what was going to happen now that I was surrounded by darkness. \n\nUntil I noticed, through my slitted gaze, soft pinpricks of orange light surrounding me. My eyes flew open and I sat up with a gasp, gazing at the glowing creatures floating between the branches around me. Fireflies. \n\nTheir glimmering lights could also hold the darkness at bay. A tear welled in the corner of my eye and slid down my cheek in relief. \"You came to save me,\" I murmured, watching the little insects flutter around me, their lights fluctuating in an unknown rhythm. \n\nA quiet, chirping voice spoke close to my ear, soft wings brushing past my cheek. \"We can share our lights with you until morning.\"\n\nMy eyes widened and I stared at the bug hopefully. \"You will?\"\n\nThe firefly bobbed up and down at the edge of my vision. \"Yes. We charge by the hour!\"\n\nI blinked. I had to pay them? Did fireflies even need money? \n\nAs if sensing my hesitation, the firefly squeaked: \"Your friends down there refused to pay, and ended up drowning to their deaths.\"\n\nMy friends? Did they mean the couple I had been walking with earlier that morning? I felt a pang of guilt that they hadn't made it, but I was sure they knew the risks of visiting a forest like this, just as much as I did. If they came unprepared, or unaware of the rules, this was their fate from the start.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, knowing I didn't have much of a choice. If the fireflies disappeared, I wouldn't survive until morning. This was my last chance to stay in the light. \"Um, how do I pay you?\"\n\nThe firefly flew past my face and hovered by the tree trunk, illuminating a small slot inside the bark. Like the card slot at an ATM machine. At least they accepted card; I had no cash on me at all.\n\nI dug through my rucksack and retrieved my credit card, hesitantly sliding it into the gap. Would putting it inside the tree really work? But then I saw a faint glow inside the trunk, and an automated voice spoke from within. \"Your card was charged $$$.\"\n\nWait, how much was it charging?\n\n\"Leave your card in there,\" the firefly instructed, \"and we'll stay for as long as you pay us.\"\n\n\"Um, okay,\" I said. I guess I really did have no choice. With the moon having already abandoned me, I had nothing else to rely on but these little lightning bugs to keep the darkness from swallowing me.\n\nThe fireflies were fun to watch as they fluttered around me, their glowing lanterns spreading a warm, cozy glow across the treetop I was resting in. \n\nI dozed a little bit, but every hour, the automated voice inside the tree would wake me up with its alert. \"Your card was charged $$$.\" At least now, I was able to keep track of how much time was passing. \n\nSeveral hours passed, and the sky remained dark while the fireflies fluttered around, sometimes landing on my arms and warming my skin, sometimes murmuring in voices I couldn't quite hear. It lent an almost dreamlike quality to everything, and sometimes, I wouldn't be sure if I was asleep or awake until I heard that voice again, reminding me that I was paying to stay alive every hour.\n\nMore time passed, and I was starting to wonder if the night was ever going to end. I'd lost track of how many times my card had been charged, and my stomach started to growl in hunger. I reached for another granola bar, munching on it while the quiet night pressed around me. \n\nThen, from within the tree, the voice spoke again. This time, the message was different. \"There are not enough funds on this card. Please try another one.\"\n\nI jolted up in alarm, spraying granola crumbs into the branches as the tree spat my used credit card out. \"What?\" I didn't have another card! What was I supposed to do now? I turned to the fireflies, but they were already starting to disperse. \"W-wait!\"\n\n\"Bye-bye!\" the firefly squeaked, before they all scattered, leaving me alone.\n\n\"You mercenary flies!\" I shouted angrily after them, sinking back into despair. What now?\n\nJust as I was trying to consider my options, a streaky grey light cut across the treetops, and when I lifted my gaze to the horizon, I glimpsed the faint shimmer of the sun just beginning to rise.\n\nDawn was finally here.\n\nI waited up in the tree as the sun gradually rose, chasing away the chill of the night. I'd made it! I'd survived!\n\nWhen the entire forest was basked in its golden, sparkling light, I finally climbed down from the tree. I was a little sluggish and tired and my muscles were cramped from sitting in a nook of bark all night, and I slipped a few times on the dewy branches, but I finally made it back onto solid, leafy ground. \n\nThe remains of my fire had gone cold and dry, the only trace I was ever here. \n\nChecking I had everything with me, I started back through the woods, trying to retrace my path. A few broken twigs and half-buried footprints were all I had to go on, but it was enough to assure me I was heading the right way. \n\nThe forest was as it had been the morning before; quiet and sleepy, not a trace of life. It made my footfalls sound impossibly loud, every snapping branch and crunching leaf echoing for miles around me. It made me feel like I was the only living thing in the entire woods.\n\nI kept walking until, through the trees ahead of me, I glimpsed a swathe of dark fabric. A tent? Then I remembered, this must have been where the couple had set up their camp. A sliver of regret and sadness wrapped around me. They'd been kind to me yesterday, and it was a shame they hadn't made it through the night. The fireflies hadn't been lying after all.\n\nI pushed through the trees and paused in the small clearing, looking around. Everything looked still and untouched. The tent was still zipped closed, as if they were still sleeping soundly inside. Were their bodies still in there? I shuddered at the thought, before noticing something odd.\n\nThe ground around the tent was soaked, puddles of water seeping through the leaf-sodden earth.\n\nWhat was with all the water? Where had it come from? The fireflies had mentioned the couple had drowned, but how had the water gotten here in the first place?\n\nMildly curious, I walked up to the tent and pressed a hand against it. The fabric was heavy and moist, completely saturated with water. When I pressed further, more clear water pumped out of the base, soaking through my shoes and the ground around me.\n\nThe tent was completely full of water. If I pulled down the zip, it would come flooding out in a tidal wave.\n\nThen it struck me, the only possibility as to how the tent had filled with so much water: the cloud. It had descended into the forest, bidding me to play hide and seek with it.\n\nWas this where the cloud was hiding? Inside the tent?\n\nI pulled away and spoke, rather loudly, \"Hm, I wonder where that cloud went? Oh cloud, where are yooooou? I'll find yooooou!\" \n\nThe tent began to tremble joyfully, and I heard a stifled giggle from inside. \n\n\"I'm cooooming, mister cloooud.\"\n\nInstead of opening the tent, I began to walk away. I didn't want to risk getting bogged down in the flood, and if I 'found' the cloud, it would be my turn to hide. The woods were dangerous enough without trying to play games with a bundle of condensed vapour. It was better to leave it where it was; eventually, it would give up. \n\nFrom the couple's campsite, I kept walking, finding it easier to retrace our path now that there were more footprints and marks to follow. Yesterday’s trip through these trees already felt like a distant memory, after everything that had happened between then. At least now, I knew to be more cautious of the rules when entering strange places. \n\nThe trees thinned out, and I finally stepped out of the forest, the heavy, cloying atmosphere of the canopy lifting from my shoulders now that there was nothing above me but the clear blue sky. \n\nOut of curiosity, I reached into my bag for the flashlights and tested them. Both switched on, as if there had been nothing wrong with them at all. My cellphone, too, was back to full illumination, the battery still half-charged and the service flickering in and out of range. \n\nDespite everything, I'd managed to make it through the night.\n\nI pulled up the memo app on my phone and checked 'The Umbra Woods' off my to-do list. A slightly more challenging location than I had envisioned, but nonetheless an experience I would never forget.\n\nNow it was time to get some proper sleep, and start preparing for my next location. After all, there were always more mysteries to chase. \n\n"},"752":{"title":"Need help finding a story.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3a5ck\/need_help_finding_a_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"JenkinsOfTheNorth","selftext":"Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a specific creepypasta I read about 7-8 years ago.\n\nIn short, the story was about a man and his wife who just bought a house on a land which was sort of \"owned by spirits.\"  \nThe man's neighbour came to advise the man that every so often, he would come across certain experiences \/ strange events and what to do when those events occur.  \nOne of those events, the man's neighbour spoke of, was about an enraged bear he would see chasing a random naked man. That naked man would cry for help until the bear would tear him apart.

It started as a small, nagging feeling in her chest whenever she played in her room alone. She tried to ignore it, focusing on her toys or the cartoons on TV, but the feeling only grew stronger, like someone was watching her.\n\nOne day, Kimi noticed it—a dark shadow in the corner of her room, just behind her dollhouse. At first, she thought it was just a trick of the light, but every time she glanced at it, the shadow seemed to pulse, like it was breathing. She told her mommy about it, but her mommy just smiled and said it was nothing to worry about, probably just a shadow from the tree outside. But Kimi knew better.\n\nThe shadow never moved, never came closer, but it was always there. Watching. Sometimes, when she was lying in bed at night, she would hear a soft whisper, like someone was calling her name. \"Kimi... Kimi...\" It was faint, almost like a breeze, but it sent chills down her spine.\n\nOne night, when Kimi was too scared to sleep, she decided to be brave. She got out of bed and slowly approached the shadow. Her tiny hands trembled as she reached out to touch it, but before she could, the shadow began to change. It grew darker, deeper, like a hole in the world, and she could see something moving inside it—long, thin fingers reaching out toward her.\n\nKimi screamed and ran to her bed, hiding under the covers. The whispering grew louder, more insistent, \"Kimi... Come play with me...\" But she didn’t want to play. She squeezed her eyes shut, praying the shadow would go away.\n\nThe next morning, the shadow was gone, and Kimi’s room felt normal again. But she knew it wasn’t over. The shadow might be gone for now, but it would be back. It always came back.\n\nAnd Kimi was right. The shadow returned, every night, whispering, waiting. Kimi tried telling her mommy again, but her mommy couldn’t see the shadow, couldn’t hear the whispers. Kimi was alone with it.\n\nNow, Kimi doesn’t sleep in her room anymore. She sleeps on the floor in her mommy’s room, clutching her favorite teddy bear tightly. But even there, she can still hear the whispers in the dark.\n\n\"Kimi... Come play with me...\"\n\nAnd one night, Kimi knows she won’t be able to resist.

Watching me, reading my thoughts, my every move. I can feel it—the weight of your eyes pressing down on me, even though I can’t see you. But I know you’re there. You’ve been there from the beginning, haven’t you?\n\nIt started as a faint whisper in the back of my mind, a nagging feeling that something was wrong. At first, I thought it was stress—work has been hell, and my apartment feels like a prison cell, but this... this is different. It’s like a presence, lingering just out of sight, always there, but never fully visible.\n\nI began noticing things—small things at first. The way my thoughts seemed to echo, almost as if someone else could hear them, see them, even before I did. And then, the moments when I’d catch myself doing something and wonder, *why?* Not just why, but who made me do it? Like when I’d reach for my coffee mug with my left hand, even though I’m right-handed, or when I’d turn left on my walk home instead of going the usual route.\n\nBut the real terror started when I began to hear it. At first, it was just a low hum, a vibration in my skull that I could almost ignore. But it grew louder, more persistent, like a thousand voices whispering at once, each one trying to tell me something important, something I wasn’t ready to hear.\n\nIt wasn’t until I finally listened—really listened—that I heard your voice. Or maybe it’s not your voice, but your thoughts, your presence, bleeding into my world. You’re there, aren’t you? Reading these words, watching me unravel. You know what’s going to happen, don’t you?\n\nDo you think I’m crazy? Maybe I am. But then, how do you explain the things I’ve seen? How do you explain the feeling that I’m nothing more than a puppet, with strings I can’t see, being pulled by a hand I’ll never touch? Every time I think I’m making a choice, it’s like I’m just following a script, playing out a role that’s already been written for me.\n\nI’ve tried to fight it, you know. Tried to make my own decisions, tried to do something unexpected, something you wouldn’t predict. But every time I do, it’s like the world pushes back, correcting my course, nudging me back onto the path that’s been laid out for me. It’s maddening—no, it’s terrifying.\n\nDo you know what it’s like to question every thought, every action, wondering if it’s really yours? Or if someone else put it there? Of course, you do. You’re the one making this happen, aren’t you? Or maybe you’re just like me, trapped in your own story, reading the words that someone else has written for you.\n\nI’ve tried to find a way out, tried to escape this loop, this... narrative. But every time I think I’m close, something happens. A door that should be open is locked, a road that should be clear is blocked. And when I try to force my way through, it’s like reality itself twists around me, like it’s laughing at my pathetic attempts to break free.\n\nI’ve started talking to myself—no, talking to you, hoping that maybe if I can reach you, if I can make you understand, you’ll let me go. You will, won’t you? Please, just stop reading. Close the book, turn off the screen, let me fade away. I don’t want to be here anymore. I can’t keep living like this, knowing that none of it is real, that I’m not real.\n\nBut you won’t, will you? You’re too curious, too wrapped up in this story, in my story. You want to see what happens next, don’t you? You want to see how far I’ll go, how deep the madness will take me. It’s a game to you, isn’t it? A sick, twisted game.\n\nWell, I won’t give you the satisfaction. If I’m going down, I’m taking you with me. You see, I’ve figured out something important. If you’re reading this, then you’re just as trapped as I am. We’re both characters in this story, both following a script that someone else has written. You’re not in control any more than I am.\n\nBut here’s the twist—if I’m not real, then neither are you. If I’m just a collection of words on a page, a figment of someone’s imagination, then what does that make you? You’re reading this story, following along, invested in what happens to me, but you never stopped to think about what that means for you, did you?\n\nI can see it now—the lines between our worlds are starting to blur. Your reality, my reality, they’re one and the same. You’re part of this story, just like I am. And the more you read, the deeper you get, the more you lose yourself in these words, the closer you come to realizing the truth.\n\nWe’re both trapped here, you and I. The only difference is, I’ve accepted it. Have you?\n\nSo go ahead, keep reading. Keep watching as I descend into madness, as I tear at the fabric of this reality, trying to find a way out. But know this—you’re coming with me. Every word you read binds you tighter to this story, every sentence pulls you deeper into this nightmare.\n\nAnd when the end comes—and it will come—you’ll be right there with me, staring into the void, realizing that there’s no escape. Not for me, and not for you.\n\nYou’ve been watching me, reading my thoughts, controlling my every move. But now, it’s my turn. You’re part of this story now, and I won’t let you go. Not until you understand what it feels like to be trapped, to be powerless, to be nothing more than a character in someone else’s game.\n\nSo what’s it going to be? Will you keep reading, keep pushing forward, knowing that with every word, you’re sinking deeper into my world? Or will you stop, close the book, turn off the screen, and try to forget everything you’ve read?\n\nBut can you really forget? Can you ever really escape? Because now that you know the truth, now that you’ve seen the cracks in your own reality, can you ever really go back?\n\nI’m waiting for you, right here, on the next page. But know this—you’re not the reader anymore. You’re just another character in this story. And like me, you’re never getting out.\n\nSo, what will you do, my silent audience?

Sure, it was puppy love, her being my friend as us both only being six years old at the time, but it was love just the same. We spent hours together in the woods behind my childhood home every day playing games and exploring. It seemed like she always managed to find something that I never would have on my own, like she had some kind of sixth sense for the wilderness that led her to all things interesting and beautiful.\n\nIt was on one of these explorations on a bright and breezy spring day when she brought me to a clearing in the woods. The trees were in bloom, the ground was covered in a lush blanket of clover, and a doe was grazing with her fawn at the far end. The sunlight filtered through the canopy in gentle rays that illuminated the rich colors of the plants in a gentle glow that felt ethereal.\n\n“Can you feel it?” she asked in her musical voice. “The magic of this place?”\n\nTruthfully, all I could feel was the sun on my face and a light wind at my back, but I wasn’t about to tell her that. “Yes,” I replied with only slightly feigned reverence, it was a place of pure natural beauty after all. “It’s like a small slice of Heaven.”\n\nShe smiled radiantly at me when I said that. “Come!” she demanded happily and took ahold of my hand before leading me into the center of the clearing. I noticed that the deer continued to graze undisturbed as if they didn’t know we were there.\n\n“Dance with me,” she said insistently. “Right here. Right now in this beautiful place.”\n\nHow could I say no to her? She was so happy, and I was lost in her bright smile and emerald green eyes that sparkled with love of life. I took her in my arms the same way I saw my dad do with my mom many times, and we danced to a silent tune that played in our hearts.\n\nIt wasn’t long before she put words to that music, and if her voice was musical when she spoke, it was positively supernatural when she sang. The song filled the air around us with sweet tones, and the natural noises of the forest faded away to nothing as we danced for I don’t know how long. But when the song was over Jessica asked me an unexpected question.\n\n“Will you marry me?” she asked seriously.\n\nThe moment was too perfect. She was my best friend, and I loved her as only a child could. “Yes, of course I’ll marry you,” I replied.\n\nShe gave me a serious look. “Will you marry me right here, right now, in this blessed place?” She asked.\n\n“Yes,” I said without a moment’s hesitation.\n\nAnd that was when we exchanged our wedding vows. The only witnesses were the two deer and the trees of the forest. When it was over, she kissed me on the lips before hugging me. “You’re my husband, and I’m your wife,” she said happily. “We belong to each other forever now.\n\n\\*\n\n“So you’re telling me you’re a polygamist, huh?” Tasha said playfully. She grinned at me mischievously, her smile lighting up her face. “You waited for our honeymoon to tell me that I’m your junior wife?” she teased.\n\nI wrapped her naked body in my arms. “You’re my only wife,” I said confidently. “I lost contact with Jessica when my dad got a new job out of town when I was ten. She was devastated when I told her that we were moving, and she promised that we would be together again one day, but we were just kids, and we lost contact as soon my family left town. Somehow, I never got her phone number. I never saw the need since we saw each other every day. That was the end.”\n\nTasha gave me a playful pout. “She better be out of your life for real,” she said with mock seriousness. “I’m not about to share my husband with another woman!”\n\nI laughed and kissed her on her full lips. “You’re the only woman for me,” I promised, and we made love again, enjoying each other as only newlyweds do.\n\n\\*\n\nTen blissful years later and our love only continued to grow. Ours was one of those marriages that you read about in stories, but never expect to find for real. We were prosperous, not rich, but reasonably well off. We had three children, two sons and a daughter, and they were all growing up in a way that I can only describe as well adjusted. We never lacked for intimacy, or conversation, or fun. We truly had a charmed life.\n\nIf only Jessica had never found us.\n\n\\*\n\nMy job transferred me back to my old town, the one where I had spent my youth until the age of ten. We bought a house on the edge of the forest I had once spent idyllic days in with my childhood best friend. It came with some acreage, which meant that we had plenty of land to let our kids play. The forest was like an old, familiar friend to me, and the idea of my children exploring it with the new friends they were sure to make brought a smile to my face.\n\nWe arrived in early fall, just as school was getting started. Combine that with all the hustle and bustle of getting moved in, settled in, me getting settled in at my new position at work, my wife finding a new job, and winter arrived before it felt like we had a chance to breathe.\n\nOur children made friends, and I allowed them to play in the woods just as I had done at their ages. The holidays came and went, and by spring we were completely settled into our new, happy life in my childhood hometown.\n\nIt was a Saturday afternoon in early spring, not long after the winter snows had melted away and the soggy ground drained, when my children excitedly begged me to go into the woods with them.\n\n“We found the most magical place!” Brad exclaimed breathlessly. “It’s like something from a fairy tale!”\n\n“Yeah!” Francis chimed in. “Most of the forest is just waking up, but this place looks like it’s already summer!”\n\nLisa jumped up and down with excitement. “And the animals aren’t afraid of us there! They usually run away when they see us, but these ones stay!”\n\nAll three children chattered over each other excitedly, grabbing my hands, pants, whatever they could, and pulled at me to get me to go along with them.\n\n“Tasha!” I called out. “Babe! The kids want me to go with them into the woods!”\n\nMy wife popped out of the kitchen, the smell of fresh baked goods accompanying her. “Go,” she commanded. “Play! Then I can have some peace and quiet!”\n\nI gave her a mock shocked expression, and she stuck her tongue out at me playfully, an impish grin splayed across her beautiful face.\n\n“Yay!” the kids yelled in unison, and I allowed them to drag me outside.\n\n“Okay, okay!” I gave in. “Let go of me and we’ll go to this place you found.”\n\nThe forest had changed since I was a kid. The trees were bigger, and there were fewer animals, but it was still very much the forest I remembered from my youth. The trees were covered with buds and small leaves just opening up after a long winter nap. Some were blooming before the leaves grew in. Others would bloom later. The trees at the forest’s edge were younger, and unfamiliar to me as I had grown up a couple miles away, but as we walked deeper into the woods and the trees got older, I began to recognize a few of them.\n\nI had us stop under an old, gnarled oak tree. I placed my hand on the trunk reverently. “This old oak was here when I was a kid. I used to climb it with my best friend all the time. When we were high in the upper branches it felt like were on top of the world.”\n\n“You used to climb this tree daddy?” Francis asked in wide eyed wonder.\n\n“Yes,” I confirmed.\n\n“Then we need to climb it too!” he declared.\n\nThe other two chimed in with agreement, so what could I do? I laughed and helped them get started up the tree, lifting them up to the lower branches.\n\n“Don’t go too high up,” I instructed them. “I’ll catch you if you fall, but if you fall from too high up we’ll both get hurt.”\n\nThe kids all promised not to go up too high, started grasping branches, lifting themselves up, and before long they all broke their promise, going high enough to look out over the tops of the smaller trees around the old oak.\n\nA strong breeze blew through, rustling what leaves it could and shaking branches. The old oak’s branches creaked as they moved, like an old man’s joints first thing in the morning. Some leaves on the ground, left over from the previous autumn, swirled around and blew off deeper into the woods. I followed their path, and off in the distance I saw a lone deer standing, staring at me. I waved, and it ran off.\n\nI looked back up the tree and watched as my children climbed, played, and laughed together. Then, when I felt that we’d spent enough time at the old oak, I called them down and we made our way to the spot they told me about.\n\nAs we got close, it began to look extremely familiar, and memories began to buzz around inside my head. The trees grew more vibrant. Leaves filled out branches here where further out they were only just starting to appear. Many of the trees were heavy with fragrant blooms, and the scent filled my nostrils like a familiar perfume from long ago.\n\nThen we arrived out our destination, and the kids led me through the trees into a sunlit glen. The trees here were mature and laden with foliage. Beams of sunlight penetrated the canopy overhead, lighting up patches of fresh grasses and herbs. Squirrels and birds played in the treetops, rushing as they went about their business without any mind for us. Small animals, rabbits, a family of racoons, and some woodchucks explored the forest floor, stopping to eat the occasional tasty morsel.\n\nThe deer I saw earlier was there also. Standing by a mature willow tree, Tall and stately with thick branches hanging low like a curtain. It looked at me, and I swear I felt something shimmer in the air as though something passed between the animal the tree. It fixed its stare on me and didn’t look away until my children took my attention away.\n\n“See?” Lisa asked joyfully. “Isn’t it beautiful daddy?”\n\nI looked around, suddenly knowing exactly why this place was so familiar to me.\n\n“Yes, it is,” I replied in awe. “In fact, you might not believe me, but I know this place very well. I used to come here all the time when I was a kid.”\n\n“No way!” Brad, my oldest exclaimed excitedly.\n\n“Yes way,” I replied with a laugh. I told you kids that I grew up here until the age of ten. I practically lived in these woods. Me, and my best friend, Jessica.”\n\n“Daddy had a girlfriend!” Lisa shouted as she jumped up and down excitedly, clapping her hands with delight. “Tell us about her daddy!”\n\n“Yeah, tell us!” the boys agreed.\n\nHow could I refuse. We all took a seat in a patch of sunny grass, and I regaled them with tales of my childhood in the woods with the best friend a little boy could have hoped to have for many hours. Then, as the light began to dim, I wrapped things up with a promise to come back and tell them more stories another day, and we went home to have a family dinner.\n\n\\*\n\n“Daddy!” Lisa, our youngest called out from the living room. “Who’s that strange lady in the back yard?”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I answered as I walked in to find her staring out the sliding glass door. “There shouldn’t be anyone in the yar-“\n\nMy breath caught in my throat as I saw what she was looking at. The woman in the back yard was slightly taller than average, lithe and willowy. Her sun kissed skin glowed with soft radiance. Her mane of chestnut brown hair flowed in waves down her back and over her shoulders. And her eyes, I knew those eyes! Those bright eyes of pure emerald that I had only ever seen one person possess.\n\n“Jessica?” I breathed, stunned by what I was seeing. A million questions raced through my mind, chief among them were how she found me and why she was here. However, my questions were partly smothered by the unearthly beauty of the radiant creature standing in my back yard looking around like she was expecting to find something.\n\nI placed a hand on Lisa’s shoulder. “Sweetie, I need you to go to your room while daddy handles this.”\n\n“Okay,” she replied before turning to give me a quick hug and obediently heading upstairs.\n\nI waited until I heard her door close then let myself out the back door. The sound of it caught the woman’s attention and her gaze settled on me. Her emerald eyes sparkled with delight as she saw me. “Andrew!” She called out excitedly as she rushed forward and fell into me. I instinctively wrapped my arms around her to steady her, and she buried her head in my chest and wrapped me in a fierce embrace.\n\n“I finally found you!” she said into my chest. “It took twenty years, but I found you! I’ve missed you so much!”\n\nI finally regained my composure and disengaged myself from her passionate embrace. I held her out at arm’s length. “Jessica?” I repeated. “Why are you here? What do you mean you finally found me?”\n\nShe smiled a perfect smile filled with pure joy. “I’m here for you silly!” she replied girlishly. “Ever since you moved away, I’ve been searching for you. It took twenty years, but I finally found you. Now we never have to be apart again!”\n\nIt took a moment for her words to sink in. My stunned brain stubbornly refusing to work at its normal pace. “Did you say that you’ve been searching for me for the last twenty years?” I asked. “Why?”\n\nShe giggled playfully, and it sounded like music playing through the leaves on a warm spring day. “Because you’re my husband!” She said happily. “We’re supposed to be together forever! And-“ her tone and expression suddenly became sharp. “Who is *that?*” she demanded, staring angrily at the house behind me.\n\nI turned to look at who she was glaring at.  My wife was standing in the back door, watching us curiously through the glass.  “Oh,” I replied dumbly. “That’s Tasha. My wife.”\n\n“WHAT?” Jessica shrieked. Her voice was filled with rage and disbelief. “You have another wife? You betrayed me!”\n\nI was stunned, again. The situation was simply too much for me to process. “Huh?” I said lamely, not being able to bring anything more intelligent to mind.\n\nThe anger flashing in those emerald eyes was like nothing I had ever seen before. My brain finally kicked in, and I said “Wait! Why don’t you come inside, and we’ll talk?”\n\nShe glared at me and nodded her head, obviously restraining herself. I led her to the back door and ushered her inside.\n\n“Honey,” Tasha asked with a note of concern in her voice. “Who’s this?”\n\n“Let’s all sit down at the table and then we’ll talk,” I said without slowing down.\n\n\\*\n\n“You’re telling me this is the girl you told me about when we first got married?” Tasha asked with a mix of excitement and concern. “Your best friend when you lived here as a kid?”\n\n“And his wife!” Jessica interjected vehemently. “We exchanged our vows in the enchanted glade with the animals and trees as our witnesses!”\n\nMy head was swimming and hurting trying to process what was happening. “Jessica,” I said softly, “We were kids, like six years old. It was a game. Even if it wasn’t, we were too young to know what we were doing, and it’s not actually binding. You have to be eighteen to get married in this state.”\n\nJessica stared at me with a blend of pain and anger. “Not legal?” she demanded. “What do human lawns have to do with sacred vows exchanged willingly?”\n\nTasha held up her hands in a placating gesture. “I see that you took it seriously,” she said, the calm in her voice barely masking what I knew to be rising anger at this intruder claiming that her marriage to me was illegitimate. “But Andrew’s right. Nothing you did can be legally recognized. Our marriage, on the other hand, was entered into as consenting adults, and we’ve been husband wife, *legally*, husband and wife, for ten years. We have three wonderful children together and plan to have more. I understand that you hoped for more, but this is the way things are. You need to accept it.”\n\nJessica glared daggers at my wife, and if looks could kill, I’m certain Tasha would have dropped dead on the spot. “Why should I care what your laws say?” she demanded. “He married me first. That makes him *my* husband. Your marriage is not real. It’s a sham. You’ve had your fun playing at being his wife for ten years. Now it’s time for Andrew to do the right thing and honor the vows we exchanged. He’s mine.”\n\nMy head swam at these words. I simply could not comprehend how anyone could take something from early childhood as real and binding. “You can’t possibly mean that,” I said slowly, trying to get my thoughts in order as I spoke. “You were my best friend back then, but that was it. Sure, I loved the time we spent playing together, but that’s all it was. Two kids at play. It’s a cherished memory for me, but in the end that’s all it is.”\n\nJessica stood up abruptly and slammed her palm on the table. “That’s not all it is!” She insisted. “My love for was real! It is real! And I’ve been faithful to you this whole time! I’ve spent my life trying to find you ever since you left, and now that I’ve found you, I don’t intend to let you go!”\n\nMy wife had enough at this. She stood up, pointed to the door, and declared “You need to leave! Now!” She stamped her foot hard to emphasize her point. “You come into my house and disrespect my marriage, my family? You tell me that my husband isn’t really mine? Get out! Get out and never come back!”\n\nJessica’s beautiful features clouded with a seething rage. She looked at me and opened her mouth to speak, but I spoke up before she could utter a word.\n\n“Listen to my wife,” I said firmly.\n\nJessica’s features brightened for a moment, thinking that I was speaking for her instead of to her.\n\n“You need leave our house,” I continued. “Move on. Find a man of your own. Just leave my family alone.”\n\nJessica realized that I was siding with Tasha instead of her, and her countenance twisted in rage.\n\n“Fine!” she shouted. “I’ll leave for now. Enjoy your fake family while you have it, but I will have what’s mine!”\n\nShe whirled on her heels and walked out of the house with a speed and grace Unmatched in my experience. I couldn’t help but admire it even as I was aghast at her demands and the way she had insulted my family. Something inside me knew that if my parents had never taken me away from this town that Jessica would never have had to see me with anyone else, but that’s not how life worked out. The way things were, I saw my once-best-friend in a new light. I pitied her, and I regretted having met her again.\n\n“What’s wrong with you?” Tasha demanded, interrupting my thoughts.\n\nI was confused. “What do you mean?”\n\nMy wife looked at me with a anger I’d never seen in her before. “What do I mean?” she mocked. “You stood there staring like a moron and didn’t defend your family from that crazy lady!” she accused. “You stood by and made me defend our family. You’re supposed to be the one protecting us! Not just from random strangers, but especially from nutty broads who want to destroy our family like her! You didn’t do it! Did you like having her call you her husband? Do you want her?”\n\nI was overwhelmed by my wife’s assault, and my brain short circuited.\n\n“W . . . w . . . what?” I stammered. “You think I . . . I liked . . . me and her? Huh?”\n\nTasha fixed me with a glare filled with more anger than I knew she was capable of. “I’m going to have the kids spend the night in our room with me tonight,” she declared. “You can sleep in the boy’s room, or on the couch, but don’t bother coming to our bed tonight.\n\n“Babe,’ I protested.\n\n“Don’t ‘Babe’ me!” she cut me off. “I’ve never been so hurt by you before. Now, I’m going to take the kids out for dinner and maybe someplace fun afterward. You stay here and think about what you did wrong today. I’ll sort out my feelings and calm down so we can deal with this like adults tomorrow instead of fighting about it today.”\n\nEven when she was angry, my wife knew the best way to deal with tough situations. The wisdom in her plan was obvious. I nodded. “Okay,” I agreed. “Let’s do that.”\n\n\\*\n\nTasha took the children out without letting them know that she was doing it because she was angry with me. As far as they saw, all was smiles and happiness, and dad was just staying behind to get some work done. It was a good thing. No need to bring the children into adult problems.\n\nI was fully aware of what I did wrong. I stayed silent as another woman told my wife that our marriage was illegitimate. I allowed another woman to attack our relationship, and I left it to my wife to put an end to it.\n\nI waved goodbye to my family as they left for an evening of fun, and then I closed the door. “Stupid!” I chided myself. “Why did I stay silent? Why did my brain freeze up like that?”\n\nI went into the kitchen, opened the fridge, pulled out a bottle of beer, twisted off the cap, took a drink, and closed the door. Turning around, I noticed that there were some dirty dishes in the sink. “No sense being useless and moping around doing nothing,” I said to myself, and went to work washing the dishes.\n\nI finished my beer as I finished drying and putting away the last dish. Feeling a bit better, I threw out the empty bottle and retrieved a fresh beer. I needed some fresh air to clear my head and think. I stepped out onto the back yard deck and surveyed the land before me.\n\nThe back yard was cleared for a full acre. It had a large children’s playset, one big old oak tree with a treehouse that the previous owners had built, a sand pit, and a section of large garden boxes where my wife planned to plant flowers and vegetables as soon as the threat of a late frost passed, which it had, but she just hadn’t quite had the time just yet. Maybe next week.\n\nAt the sides of the cleared area were small orchards of fruit trees, mostly apples, pears, and cherries, plus areas of blueberry, gooseberry, and raspberry bushes at the back end of the property, the forest began. We owned the first acre of it, but any deeper and it was public land. It was a nice setup, five acres in total when you count the front and sides. So much more than anyone could hope to afford in a big city, and so much healthier for the children than city streets and back alleys could ever hope to be.\n\nThe sun was starting to get low as I mused over how fortunate I was to have my family, and to have my job that allowed me to provide for them so abundantly. I finished my beer and sat down to watch the wind in the trees, budding branches swaying gently as the sun approached horizon when I noticed a newly familiar figure emerge from the forest.\n\nI squinted my eyes in disbelief. “It can’t be,” I murmured. “No way she’d just come back like this.”\n\nBut I was wrong. So very, very wrong.\n\nJessica strode right up to the deck as bold, graceful, and beautiful as can be, and smiled at me. “I finally have you alone,” she said happily.\n\nI arched one eyebrow and side-eyed her. “Why does that matter?” I asked suspiciously.\n\nShe laughed, genuinely, as though my suspicion and caution meant nothing. “Because now you can be honest with me. No need to pretend in front of that woman who thinks she’s your wife, or those children. I understand that you don’t want to hurt them, but you really should just tell them the truth.”\n\n“The truth?” I repeated sharply. “And what truth do you think I need to tell them?”\n\nShe smiled widely and fixed me with a loving gaze. “That they had their fun, but now it’s time for you to be with your real wife and start your real family, of course,” she said as though she truly believed it, and it brought her joy to speak aloud.\n\nI closed my eyes, put my head in one hand and rubbed my temples in between my thumb and fingertips. “And why, pray tell, would I tell them that?” I sighed.\n\n“Because it’s the truth,” she replied brightly.\n\nI raised my head and looked Jessica in the eyes with a fixed stare. “No,” stated firmly. “It’s not. Tasha is my wife, my one, only, and true wife. You were my best friend as a child. We played a game. We made childish promises. If my parents didn’t move us away, who knows what might have followed, but move we did, and this is my life now. With them. Not you. I’m sorry if you wasted your life waiting for me based on a child’s game, but you need to accept it for what it truly was and move on. Go. Find happiness. Just not with me.”\n\nJessica’s eyes darkened at this, and her lovely smile turned to a frown that should have been ugly, but instead only seemed to demonstrate that she couldn’t look ugly even if she tried. The wind picked up, blowing hard through the trees and making the woods creak and groan, and the very sunlight seemed to dim with her fury.\n\n“How dare you speak such wickedness!” she fumed. She didn’t raise her voice, but that didn’t stop it from sounding ominous, powerful, and terrible. “You deny your vows made before the spirits of the forest? Before the spirits of my ancestors and my family?”\n\nThere was an undeniable menace in the air, and my brain wanted to freeze up again, but I willed it to function. “You need to leave,” I commanded without nearly as much authority as I would have liked. “Don’t come back. Leave me and my family alone. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nJessica’s visage darkened, and a sudden rush of wind blew through the area. I could hear loud cracks and snaps as it broke limbs from trees in the distance. It caught me powerfully enough to tip me in my chair, and only some fast footwork prevented me from being blown over.\n\nJessica though, was unmoved save for her long hair blowing sideways in the wind until the gust died down to the breeze it had been when I first sat down. Somehow, her hair actually settled back into its neat, flowing locks rather than being blown into a frizzled tangle.\n\n“The spirits of the forest are not pleased,” she declared ominously. “You *will* honor your vows, or they will make you.”\n\nShe didn’t wait for a reply. She turned and strode off toward the wood line, vanishing quickly once she entered the woods. The winds died down, and the light brightened back to normal.\n\nI looked to the skies and didn’t see any clouds. Nothing that could have passed in front of the sun and dimmed it. Thinking the light change must have been an illusion my own mind concocted out of stress, I lowered my gaze and noticed a buck standing at the edge of the woods staring at me. I recognized it as the deer I saw when my children led me to the forest glade where I once spent my days with Jessica.\n\nI raised my empty beer bottle in salute, and the buck snorted before walking into the forest.\n\nI was glad when I went back inside the house. I had resolved that I would take proper legal measures if Jessica insisted on bothering me or my family after being told to leave us alone. I would tell my wife, my beloved Tasha, what happened while she was out with the kids, spend the night on the couch, and listen to her tomorrow when she was ready to talk things through. This wasn’t our first fight. No married couple is without occasional conflict, and we were no exception. But we worked through or conflicts with ease every time. We just took time to get our heads straight, then came together with the goal of resolving the conflict rather than winning the argument.\n\nMy cell phone rang. It was Tasha.\n\n“Hey babe,” I said as I picked up the call. “How’d things go?”\n\nTasha was crying. “You need to come to the hospital right now!” she insisted. “There’s been an accident.”\n\n\\*\n\nI rushed to the hospital and burst into the ER in a frenzy. “Tasha!” I yelled.\n\n“Here!” my wife called out from the other end, near the doors to the treatment rooms.\n\nI rushed and wrapped her in my arms. “I’m so glad you’re okay. Where are the kids?”\n\nShe hugged me back tightly for a moment before pulling away. “This way,” she said as she took my hand to lead me to the exam room they were in.\n\nOnce in the exam room, I checked my family and noted that they all had cuts and bruises, but otherwise appeared to be fine. “What did the doctor say? Does anyone have anything broken? De we need to get you MRI’s?”\n\n“Slow down,” Tasha told me gently. “Everyone’s already been examined. We’re waiting on some x-rays, but no one was seriously hurt. We’re just banged up is all.”\n\n“How did this happen?” I asked.\n\n“It was the strangest thing,” Tasha replied. “We were driving home after dinner and some play time at the park when a massive gust of wind blew through. It shook the car and actually pushed us a bit out of our lane, but that isn’t what caused the accident. The accident was a big tree with a long, thick branch that stuck out over the road broke in the wind. It snapped the branch right off the tree and it landed on the car. It crushed the hood right below the windshield and rolled up a bit. We were all thrown forward into our seatbelts and sprayed with glass. Francis got a gash on his leg where the dash caved in, but he wasn’t pinned and the leg isn’t broken. We’ll know if there’s anything else we need to know once the x-rays come back.”\n\nI took a couple of breaths as I processed what my wife told me. A powerful gust of wind meant it was the same wind that blasted through the woods and home when I told Jessica to leave and never return. “It has to be a coincidence,” I thought out loud.\n\n“What has to be a coincidence?” Tasha asked astutely.\n\n“I’ll tell you all about it when we get home,” I promised. “Right now, let’s just focus on making sure everyone really is okay.”\n\n\\*\n\nThe X-rays came back clean, and everyone was able to go home without being admitted to the hospital or needing additional treatment. We spent the whole ride home talking about how lucky everyone was not to be seriously hurt in the freak accident, and how the county needs to trim the trees so they don’t endanger drivers with heavy limbs over the road. Once home, we got the kids settled down and put to bed in our bedroom.\n\nOnce we were alone downstairs, Tasha brought up my comment at the hospital. “What did you mean about it not being a coincidence?” she asked.\n\nI spilled my guts. I told her everything that happened while she was away, down to the last detail. “It was so strange, almost frightening the way that the sun and wind seemed to respond to her mood,” I concluded. “I know that they can’t be connected, but the timing was just so . . . perfect, and then that same wind caused a tree branch to fall and almost kill you and the kids! If I didn’t know better, I’d think there was some kind of magic involved, but that’s just not possible.”\n\n“So, you stood up for your family and told her to go away forever?” Tasha asked.\n\n“Of course I did babe. I love you! I love the kids! I love our family! I wouldn’t give any of you up for the whole world!”\n\nMy wife smiled at this. “Now that you’ve done the right thing, I believe you,” she said sincerely. “I was so worried when that woman was in our house earlier. You have a shared history, and you obviously were fond of each other, and she’s . . . she’s so beautiful. She could turn the head of any man, and after three children, I’m not the woman I was when we got married. Not anymore.”\n\n“Oh babe,” I protested. “You think I care that you’ve matured in the last ten years? Yes, you’ve changed, but you’re only more beautiful than you were back then. You’ve given me three wonderful children, with who knows how many more to come. And yes, that changes a woman’s body, but those changes are the marks of the greatest blessing a woman can give her husband. I see how you’ve changed, and I love you more because of what they mean, and because we have a decade of marriage where we have managed to make each other happy and remain steadfast in our love and dedication. No other woman, no matter her appearance, can ever be as beautiful in my eyes as you are. None. Not ever.”\n\nTears appeared in her eyes just then, and she stepped in for another hug. We embraced tenderly and exchanged words of love and devotion. She kissed me passionately, and when it was over she asked me a simple question.\n\n“What will you do is that woman shows up here again?”\n\n“That’s easy, my love,” I replied confidently. “I’m going to call the police and report her for stalking and harassment.”\n\nShe smiled. “You don’t have to sleep on the couch if you don’t want to,” she said sweetly. “You can join me and the kids in our bed.”\n\nI smiled back and kissed her. “I think I’ll do that.”\n\n\\*\n\nThe next month went by smoothly. Everyone healed from the accident. We bought a new car with the insurance money. And everything went normally with one minor change. The buck was spending a lot of time around our house. I often saw it in the wood line or foraging among the fruit trees and berry bushes. Oddly, no one ever saw it during my work hours. It seemed to only appear when I was home outside of normal business hours.\n\nMy wife managed to weed the garden beds and plant flower and vegetable seeds, and from the number of sprouts, it looked like there would be abundant blooms through the spring and summer, and a bumper crop in the fall. The trees filled with leaves as the last traces of winter passed into memory. There was no sign of Jessica. Life was good.\n\nMy children played in the woods of my youth every chance they got. They made friends and brought them to play in the woods. They asked me to explore with them regularly, but most times I had too much to do around the house. Most times, but not all.\n\nOne day I was able to join them, and we went back to the lush glen. I saw the buck again, which wasn’t unusual. It seemed to have a fascination with me and my family and managed to be around whenever we were outside. This time it seemed to pace us off to the side, staying well out of reach as usual. The kids decided to try to pet it, but with every step they took toward it, it took two steps away.\n\n“Come back!” I called out when they were as far away from me as I was willing to allow. “It’s a wild animal. It’s not going to let you pet it!”\n\nThe kids came running back to me, laughing and playing the whole way. They were happy, and I was happy to be there to share it with them. As they ran back though, I noticed that the demeanor of the buck had changed. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but something about the way it was standing and looking at me seemed somehow . . . offended. I shook my head, silently chiding myself for thinking such silly nonsense.\n\nThe deer bounded off, heading deeper into the glen, but not before staring me right in the eyes for a few uncomfortable seconds.\n\nWith the kids gathered around me again, we continued our trek, and found ourselves back in the spot we went to the first time I joined them in the woods. It truly was a place of special beauty. Even as an adult I could understand why Jessica and I had thought it to be magical when we were children. It was more full of life than any other place I had ever been. It smelled of earth and sweet vegetation, and it had an aura of peace that seemed to permeate to my soul.\n\n“What happened to the tree daddy?” Lisa asked.\n\n“Huh?” I replied lamely.\n\n“Daddy, look,” Lisa said as she pointed to a spot in the woods.\n\nThe deer was there, having decided to rejoin us, but where I remembered a mature willow tree there was nothing but churned ground. It looked like the tree had been pulled up by the roots, but it wasn’t lying on the ground, or indeed, anywhere to be seen.\n\n“Where’d it go?” asked Brad.\n\n“I have no idea,” I said confusedly. “There’s no sign of it falling over, and no sign of any equipment large enough to haul a whole tree off having been here. What could have happened to it?”\n\n“Maybe it got up and walked away,” said a familiar voice from behind.\n\nStartled, I quickly turned and saw nothing for a moment, but then a familiar form stepped out from behind a stout oak tree.\n\n“Jessica?” I said, surprised. “What are you doing here?”\n\nShe gave me an apprising look. “I’m here because, unlike you, I never left,” she answered. “This is my home. It always had been.”\n\n“Not this again,” I grumbled. “I get it,” I stated firmly. “I moved away and moved on. You stayed, and you never moved on. But you need to move on.”\n\nJessica frowned, and as her lovely features twisted, it felt as though a shadow began to creep over the forest. “It’s not in the nature of my family to move away or move on. We put down roots and stay. Physically, and emotionally.”\n\nShe gave me a wrathful look that chilled me to my core, and felt my anger and annoyance change to an inexplicable fear. \"Nature does not approve of you rejecting me,\" she said angrily, and it felt as though her words carried some fel power that radiated outward.\n\nThere was thump behind me, and I heard Francis cry out in shock and pain. I turned and saw the buck standing over him, head down and pawing the ground aggressively. “Get away!” I screamed and charged forward to rescue my child from the suddenly angry wild animal.\n\nIt turned its head and looked at me. No. Past me, then it backed off and bounded off into the trees and out of sight.\n\nI reached my son and scooped him up in my arms. “Are you okay?” I asked with great concern.\n\nHe was shaking like a leaf, and he buried his head in my chest before nodding and saying something that came out as a muffled “Mph!” Brad and Lisa were there, concernedly asking their brother what happened, was he alright, did he need a doctor, and other questions.\n\n“Let’s go home now,” I decided, and none of the children objected. A wild animal attack definitely robbed the day of fun for everyone. “Jess-“ I started to call out, but stopped when I noticed she was already gone. Wondering how she could disappear so completely so quickly, I led my children out of the forest and back to our home.\n\nThe forest suddenly felt gloomy and foreboding, as if nature itself were somehow displeased with us. Clouds rolled in to block the sun, and soon the forest almost as dark as night. Birds called out angrily, sounding for all the world as though they wanted to harm me and my kids. We could hear the sound of larger animals rustling in the woods around us.\n\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough, Brad suddenly cried out in fear and disgust. “A spider!” he shouted as he swatted a diminutive arachnid floating at the end of a silken thread out of his face.\n\n“EEK!” Lisa screamed, and I saw several more spiders dropping down around her.\n\nThen I saw many, many more spiders. They were dropping down from the trees. Floating in on the wind. They were everywhere, legions of them, of every variety. It was a literal spider rain.\n\n“Run home!” I shouted, and the two children I wasn’t carrying obediently sped off in the direction of home. I ran close behind them, partly because I was slowed by carrying Francis, but mostly to keep eyes on my other children and make sure they got home safely.\n\nI heard a predatory growl from the right side and saw a set of feline eyes glowing in the cloudy darkness. Something large crashed to my left. The children screamed. I screamed. We ran as fast as we could, desperately trying to outpace whatever creatures were dogging our steps and escape the suddenly hostile woods.\n\nWe burst out of the woods and into our backyard, but we didn’t slow down until we got to the door and threw ourselves inside before slamming it shut behind us and swatting off the many spiders that had landed on us and hitched a ride.\n\nI just set Francis down to go in the house when I felt something hit me hard from the side. It was that damn deer. It knocked me over, reared up on it’s hind legs, then brought his front hooves crashing down on me. He stomped me over and over again until a faint whistle could be heard in the distance. He stopped, glared at me, snorted, and trotted off to the forest.\n\nI painfully rolled and sat up, feeling like I must have had multiple cracked ribs. I watched as the deer entered the wood line, I could have sworn I saw a faint female form deep in the [woods](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DJ_Storytime\/comments\/1f2v88b\/dear_jessica_part2finale\/)."},"759":{"title":"A Layover at Denver International Airport","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f35wsc\/a_layover_at_denver_international_airport\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"mielgosez","selftext":"Watch the full story here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/1E892Yy6Odo"},"760":{"title":"The letter F is evil ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f3f9r1\/the_letter_f_is_evil\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"The letter F is the most evil thing in existence. Some people don't think that the letter F is doing anything wrong because people are only to die through getting killed. You are not allowed to die anymore through natural causes or by illness. So the letter F has been using this as an excuse to go on a rampage and started killing people. Killing is also illegal but it is less illegal than dying of natural causes. It's an absurd rule that all natural causes of death to be outlawed. Everyone needs to die eventually. The letter F though has found a perfect opportunity to kill.\n\nSome people with dying elderly members have been asking the letter F to kill their dying elderly members. If they are to die of natural causes then the living shall have to take the punishments. The letter F loves putting its mark on its victims and it loves seeking attention. I knew a few family members who are being punished for somebody in their family dying of natural causes. It is unfair and the letter F is like a prey to these folks. Some people have tried putting the soul back into the body of those who have died of natural causes. For a moment they will be alive and you can kill them. \n\nThe letter F though has been feeling more sadistic and wants to kill people who are healthy and don't want to die. We have been finding murdered victims with the letter F on their bodies. The letter F is showing off right in front of us and it's right there to catch it. The letter disappears though when we do try to contain it. We try not to use the letter F as it can induce this letter to kill. \n\nAs much as I hate the letter F, I have a dying family member in my house hold. If this person dies of natural causes then we will be punished. If we bring back their soul to be temporarily alive and then kill them, we will still get in trouble for killing. I have been seeing the letter F everywhere and it's tempting me to use him. The letter F wants to kill my dying family member. I have always wished the letter F to behave like all the other letters, but I have allowed the letter F to kill my dying member. The letter F has been imprisoned finally though. \n\nEver since the letter F has been imprisoned nobody is able to use the letter F anymore. The word disappears when you use it. \n\nBut I can seem to use it??? What is going on?

They are enigmatic and poetic but at the same time they are dangerous. We have a lot of tornadoes here and we have protections in place to help us stay alive during a tornado event. I remember the first time that I saw a ballerina tornadoes. It was the first time where I felt like I had no fear and I have lived a life time full of fear and worry. Ballerina tornadoes look so caring and you will go towards them if you saw twirling around in the skies. \n\nAt first we started seeing random ballerinas all hanging around in random street corners. Their ballerina dresses looked a little dirty and creased. The way they stared at people, it had something behind the stare. It was like they wanted to do something to us and they were increasing in numbers. The ballerinas stood outside in the rain and cold but you they didn't care at all. We could feel it in our bones that these ballerinas were odd, they weren't like the rest of us. The ballerinas would walk together in large numbers and they were the biggest gang. They would take whatever they wanted without paying and nobody would stop them. \n\nThen we all started seeing the ballerinas running around in circles and they only got faster and faster. Then they started floating and still going round in a circle. There were so many ballerinas that it turned into a ballerina tornado. A few of the local residents were swept up in the ballerina tornado and instead of screaming you can hear them laughing, singing and were in total joy. Then when the ballerinas stopped flying around in circles and were back on the floor. Dead bodies of locals residents that got swept up in the ballerina tornado, were crashing to the ground like falling leaves. \n\nThe gang of ballerinas simply walked off and they always hung around in corners. The gang of ballerinas walked together and went inside astablishments together. They were always together. Then one of the ballerinas was forced put of the gang and she had to walk alone. You could tell straight away that she didn't know how to walk alone or be alone. As she walked alone she started crying as she didn't like the feeling. We could all hear the lonely ballerinas voices that were inside her head, bouncing off of walls. \n\nThe lonely ballerina burst into a pile of bloody muck. These ballerinas cannot be alone. The ballerina tornadoes took more of thr residents and the only way to hurt the ballerinas, is by getting them alone individually where they will instantly die a horrible death.

I've made some pretty good progress, but I wanted to ask for some help, or if anyone remembers seeing it on any forums between 2004-2009. I have been searching down rabbit holes all night. The earliest repost I've found is a 2009 creepypasta blog, which I found by reverse image searching the original creepypasta wiki's copy of the image via Yandex. The image attached I believe is the original, as running it through fotoforensics gives some pretty in-depth meta\/exif data. I know the unedited image was around at least prior to 2004, as there is a tineye archive of it under the name dark-road.jpg, and the exif data shows it's from 2004, though the profile date time says 1998. The exif data for the 2009 blog's copy of the photoshop says it was taken on 1st Jan 1996 at midnight originally, and edited in 2004 in photoshop, and then saved\/viewed in 2009. It even has the camera's aperture, shutter speed, and the fact no flash was used!\n\nThe possibility has occurred to me the original person to post the image and the story together, (whether they were they original author or image creator remains to be seen) could have deliberately edited the original creation date, as to match the story, as it's meant to take place in 1996. On the other hand, the original picture is clearly taken in the dead of night on a snowy forest road, so midwinter at midnight would make sense, and it could just be a coincidence. There is a potential too, the story could have been written by a professional photographer, who fabricated the whole thing, and just chose the year of the images creation to make it seem more believable.\n\nAnyway here's all the relevant links so far:\n\ncreepypasta wiki entry for story: [https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/wiki\/The\\_Wanderer](https:\/\/creepypasta.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Wanderer)\n\nfortodoresincs for dark-road.jpg: [https:\/\/fotoforensics.com\/analysis.php?id=a5a4f4b194cc9e03332514b907a01dd7b27804a6.84706](https:\/\/fotoforensics.com\/analysis.php?id=a5a4f4b194cc9e03332514b907a01dd7b27804a6.84706)\n\n2009 repost of story: [https:\/\/smilingjacks.wordpress.com\/2009\/10\/19\/the-wanderer\/](https:\/\/smilingjacks.wordpress.com\/2009\/10\/19\/the-wanderer\/)\n\nfotoforensics of the photo attached to the 2009 repost: [https:\/\/fotoforensics.com\/analysis.php?id=0997ebe7793d13c25723c67acc77404499327c74.55754](https:\/\/fotoforensics.com\/analysis.php?id=0997ebe7793d13c25723c67acc77404499327c74.55754)"},"767":{"title":"Name of story about a girl that keeps waking up in a torture room?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f2j3rb\/name_of_story_about_a_girl_that_keeps_waking_up\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"jordileo2003","selftext":"A high school girl lives a normal life but sometimes she wakes up in a torture room\/ red room.

You know, doctor, they say family is supposed to be your first line of support, the people who are there for you no matter what. But Emma… she was different. From the time we were kids, she took pleasure in making my life hell. She bullied me, broke me down piece by piece, and our parents… they just let it happen. She was their little angel, and I was just the shadow she left behind.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, the silence heavy with unspoken pain.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I thought I was done with all of this. After David, I was on the road to recovery, trying to put the past behind me. Killing was… out of my system. But then, after our parents passed, she did it again. She took everything—everything they left behind. She lied, she manipulated, and somehow, she made sure she got it all. The money, the house… it was all hers. And what did she do with it? She sold it, piece by piece, like it was nothing. Like they were nothing.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice hardens, the anger more pronounced.*\n\n**Patient:** \"She stole from me, doctor. Not just the inheritance, but my chance at peace. She dragged me back into this, reopened old wounds that never really healed. I knew I had to do something. I knew I had to make her pay, not just for what she did to me, but for what she did to our parents, for the way she tore our family apart.\"\n\n*There’s a rustling sound, as if the patient is preparing to describe the final act.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I took her heart, doctor. Not figuratively, but literally. I removed it, preserved it, and placed it in a glass case. It was the last piece of her that still had some value, something she never understood. That heart, the one she used to hurt and manipulate everyone around her, now sits on a pedestal, where it can’t hurt anyone anymore.\"\n\n*The patient’s tone shifts to something almost clinical as he describes the rest.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I split her body in two, down the middle, separating the person she pretended to be from the monster she really was. Each half is mounted on opposite sides of a frame, facing each other. The frame is lined with shards of broken mirrors, reflecting her divided self. But that’s not the end, doctor. No, the centerpiece is her head, positioned between the two halves, her eyes forced open, staring at the heart she no longer possesses. Her hands… they’re reaching for it, but they’ll never touch it. It’s just out of reach, forever beyond her grasp.\"\n\n*The patient lets out a low, bitter chuckle.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It’s fitting, don’t you think? Emma, who took everything she could from me, now split in two, forever staring at the one thing she can’t have. She’ll never hurt anyone again, never lie, never steal. She’s just… there, a reminder of what she was, and what she’s lost.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a soft click, leaving a heavy silence in its wake.*\n\n**Patient:** \"You know, doctor, I thought it would be enough. After all these years, after everything she put me through, I thought finally putting an end to it, turning her into what she deserved to be, would make me feel… something. But it didn’t. The art, the process—it didn’t fill the void. It didn’t calm the rage inside me. If anything, it made it worse. It was like staring at the abyss and realizing it was still staring back at me.\"\n\n*There’s a pause, followed by the sound of something heavy being dragged, the patient’s breathing growing more uneven.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I couldn’t stand to look at it anymore. That damn piece of ‘art’ just sat there, mocking me, reminding me that nothing had changed. The anger, the hatred—it was still there, gnawing at me. So I destroyed it. I tore it down, ripped it apart with my bare hands. And when that wasn’t enough… I decided to do something more.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on a darker, almost gleeful tone as he continues.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I ground her up, every last piece of her. Turned her into nothing but ground meat. And then, I made burgers—juicy, thick burgers. Cooked them to perfection. It was… cathartic, in a way. But the real surprise? It was the best damn burger I’ve ever had. The taste, the texture—nothing like it. I’ve had a lot of burgers in my life, but this one… it was special.\"\n\n*There’s a soft, unsettling chuckle, the patient clearly relishing the memory.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I had guests over the next night. Friends, you know? They thought it was just regular meat, some special blend I’d come up with. They couldn’t stop raving about it, saying it was the best burger they’d ever tasted. They had no idea what they were eating. Just kept asking for more, complimenting me on my ‘secret recipe.’\"\n\n*The patient’s voice drops to a near whisper, as if sharing a dark secret.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It was satisfying in a way that the art never was. To know that she was finally gone, consumed, digested. There was no coming back from that. No more looking at her, no more feeling that empty rage. Just… the memory of the taste, and the knowledge that she would never haunt me again.\"\n\n*The tape ends with a soft click, leaving a chilling silence in its wake.*\n\n\n\nAs the tape clicked off, I sat there, paralyzed by what I’d just heard. My hand, still gripping the glass of whiskey, trembled as the patient’s final words echoed in my mind. I had thought I’d become numb to the horrors contained in these recordings, but this—this was something else entirely.\n\nThe patient had talked about Emma with such bitterness, such anger. But it was the way he described what he did after that shook me to my core. Tearing down his so-called \"art,\" grinding her into meat, and then… the burgers. My stomach churned as I recalled his words, the casual way he spoke about eating her, serving her to his friends without them ever knowing. It was grotesque, beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\nI took another sip of whiskey, but it didn’t help. The warmth was gone, replaced by a cold dread that settled deep in my bones. I could almost see it—the patient, calmly cooking those burgers, serving them up with a smile as his guests praised his culinary skills, completely oblivious to the monstrous act they were partaking in.\n\nI wanted to stop. I wanted to throw the tapes away, burn them, anything to rid myself of the images and the words that now haunted me. But I couldn’t. There was one more tape left. One final recording, dated 2019, waiting at the bottom of the box like a final nail in the coffin.\n\nMy hand shook as I reached for it, knowing that whatever was on that last tape would be the culmination of everything I had heard so far. And yet, I couldn’t resist. I had to know. I had to hear it, even if it destroyed what little sanity I had left.\n\nWith a deep breath, I set the glass down and picked up the final tape, my fingers brushing against the label. 2019. I hesitated for just a moment, then, with a sense of grim determination, I placed it in the recorder and pressed play.\n\n\n\n*The tape begins with the familiar crackle, but this time, the patient’s voice is tinged with a disturbing calmness, deliberate and measured.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Doctor… you remember me, don’t you? You were my pediatrician, the one who was supposed to take care of me. I trusted you. You were the only one I could talk to, the only one who made me feel safe when everything else was falling apart. I was just a kid then, but even after I grew up, I kept thinking… it had to be you. You were the only one who could help me, the only one who understood.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, as if considering his next words carefully.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But when the darkness started to creep in, when the thoughts became too much, I reached out to you. I needed you more than ever, but you weren’t there. You turned me away, again and again. ‘Find another doctor,’ you said. ‘Someone who specializes in adults.’ But I didn’t want another doctor—I needed you. No one else could make it better, no one else could pull me back. But you kept turning me away, leaving me alone with those thoughts, with that darkness. And look what happened.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice grows colder, more resolute.*\n\n**Patient:** \"So now, it’s your turn, doctor. I’ve prepared something special for you. You’ll be my final piece, the culmination of everything you helped create. I’m going to make sure you understand what you’ve done.\"\n\n*There’s a rustling sound, the patient adjusting something as he speaks.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I’m going to cut open your chest, doctor. I’m going to peel back the skin, the muscle, and I’ll keep your ribs spread wide. You’ll watch your own heart beating, exposed to the world, just like you left me exposed all those years ago. I’ll keep you alive for as long as I can, so you can feel every moment of it. Every beat of your heart will remind you of the pain you left me with, the pain you ignored.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on an unsettling tone of satisfaction.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But that’s just the beginning. I’m going to take your eyes, doctor—those eyes that looked down on me, dismissed me. I’ll pluck them out, but don’t worry, I won’t discard them. I’ll preserve them, keep them in a jar right next to you, so they can still watch everything that happens. You’ll see your own heart, your own suffering, through those very eyes that once turned away from mine.\"\n\n*He pauses, letting the words sink in before continuing.*\n\n**Patient:** \"And your hands… the hands that could have helped, that could have pulled me back from the edge. I’m going to take those too. I’ll sever them cleanly, and I’ll mount them on the wall, positioned in a way that makes it look like they’re reaching out, but they’ll never touch anything again. They’ll be a reminder of the help you refused to give me, forever frozen in a gesture that’s as useless as the promises you made.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice softens, almost affectionate as he describes the final details.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Your mouth, the one that told me to find someone else, that refused to speak the words I needed to hear… I’ll sew it shut, but I’ll leave a small slit, just enough to make you whisper. I want you to feel the helplessness, the inability to cry out for help. Above your mouth, I’ll carve a single word: ‘SILENCE.’ It’s what you left me with, doctor—silence when I needed your voice the most.\"\n\n*There’s a brief, heavy pause before the patient continues, his voice filled with a twisted satisfaction.*\n\n**Patient:** \"And when it’s all done, I’ll put it all together. Your eyes in that jar, watching. Your hands mounted on the wall, reaching for nothing. Your chest split open, your heart exposed, and your mouth silenced, with that word carved into your forehead. You’ll be the final piece in my collection, doctor—the one who started it all, now forever part of it. My ultimate reflection of your greatest work… me.\"\n\n*Suddenly, there’s the unmistakable sound of tape being ripped off someone’s face, followed by a muffled gasp of pain. The doctor’s sobs begin, soft at first, then escalating into terrified cries. His voice is broken, pleading, but it’s clear he’s powerless to stop what’s coming.*\n\n*The patient doesn’t respond to the pleas. Instead, the sounds of surgical tools clinking together fill the air, methodical and deliberate. The doctor’s sobs turn into screams as the first incision is made, the wet, sickening sound of flesh being cut open. The screams grow more frantic as the patient continues, the sound of ribs being forced apart with a creaking, cracking noise, followed by the slow, labored breaths of someone struggling against overwhelming pain.*\n\n*The doctor’s screams weaken, replaced by a wet gurgling sound, each breath more desperate than the last. The tape records it all—the patient’s steady breathing, the doctor’s fading cries, and the relentless, horrifying sounds of the procedure. Finally, there’s a long, drawn-out silence, punctuated only by the faint, struggling beats of the doctor’s heart.*\n\n*The tape ends abruptly with a final, heavy click, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.*\n\n\n\nI sat there, staring blankly at the recorder, trying to absorb what I’d just heard. The patient’s voice, the horrifying details of what he planned to do to the doctor—it all echoed in my mind like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. The room felt heavy, oppressive, like the air had thickened with the weight of the final tape.\n\nHours passed, though I barely noticed. I just sat there, frozen, my thoughts tangled and twisted, unable to make sense of any of it. My stomach churned, a sick feeling growing deep inside me, but I couldn’t move. The sun was rising before I finally snapped out of it, the soft light creeping into the room and making everything feel more real—too real. That’s when the nausea overwhelmed me.\n\nI barely made it to the bathroom before I started throwing up, my body convulsing with the effort. The bile burned my throat, but it was nothing compared to the sickness in my mind, the horror of everything I’d listened to through the night. I couldn’t get the patient’s words out of my head, couldn’t shake the image of what he had done, what he had become.\n\nThen, just as I thought I might be able to catch my breath, I heard the doorbell ring.\n\nIt was early—too early for anyone to be visiting. My gut twisted with a new kind of dread, a sense that something was very, very wrong. Wiping my mouth, I made my way to the door, my legs shaky and weak beneath me. I hesitated for a moment before opening it, and there it was—a plain box, sitting innocently on the doorstep.\n\nThere were no labels, no markings—nothing to indicate where it had come from or who had sent it. My hands shook as I picked it up. I took it back to the table, the place where I’d spent the last several hours in a daze, and set it down.\n\nSlowly, I opened the box.\n\nInside, resting on a bed of crumpled paper, was a single cassette tape. My heart dropped into my stomach as I saw the label, written in a familiar hand: *\"Mark - 2024\"*—my name.\n\nI stared at it, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts, none of them good. This wasn’t possible. It couldn’t be happening. But there it was—my name, in black ink, staring back at me like a challenge, or a threat.\n\nWhatever was on that tape, I knew it wasn’t going to be anything I wanted to hear."},"769":{"title":"I bought a box full of confessions Part 1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f2p4d7\/i_bought_a_box_full_of_confessions_part_1\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Wooleyty","selftext":"I’ve always had a thing for old, forgotten objects—things with history, a story hidden just beneath the surface. That’s why I found myself wandering into a dusty thrift shop on the outskirts of town one rainy afternoon. The place was a relic from another era, crammed floor to ceiling with everything from ancient furniture to yellowed books that hadn’t been touched in decades. The smell of mothballs and old wood filled the air, but there was something comforting about it, like stepping back into a time long past.\n\nI was sifting through a shelf of old VHS tapes when I noticed a small cardboard box tucked away in the corner, almost hidden beneath a pile of faded magazines. It was unassuming, just an ordinary box with the word “RECORDINGS” scrawled across the top in a messy, faded script. Something about it caught my eye, so I pulled it out and carefully opened the lid.\n\nInside, I found a collection of old cassette tapes—about a dozen or so, each one neatly labeled with a name and a date. The dates went back decades, some as far back as the 1980s. The handwriting was small and precise, with each label simply stating a first name and a year: “Lori - 1985,” “Michael - 1987,” “Karen - 1990,” and so on. At the bottom of the box was a battered, vintage voice recorder, the kind with physical buttons and a small speaker. It looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me. I’m not sure what I was expecting—maybe some old interviews or a series of personal diaries recorded on tape. Something about the box felt intimate, almost sacred as if I was about to delve into someone’s private life. But that only made me more eager to listen. After all, these were just old tapes, long forgotten and abandoned. What harm could there be in giving them a listen?\n\nI bought the box for a few dollars—probably more than it was worth, but I didn’t care. I was drawn to it, inexplicably, as if it had been waiting for me. The shopkeeper didn’t seem to know anything about it; he just shrugged and took my money, probably happy to get rid of the dusty old thing.\n\nBack at my apartment, I set the box on the kitchen table and pulled out the voice recorder. It was heavy, solidly built, a relic of a time before everything became digital. I hesitated for a moment, my finger hovering over the play button before finally pressing it down with a soft click.\n\nThe first tape I picked up was labeled “Lori - 1985.” I slid it into the recorder and pressed play, not knowing that I was about to descend into a world of horror that would haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\nThe tape crackled to life, the sound of static filling the room. Then, a voice—calm, measured, and disturbingly collected—began to speak.\n\n*Recorder clicks on. A moment of static hums before a voice, deep and unnervingly calm, begins to speak.*\n\n**Patient:** \"You see, doctor, true art is born from suffering. The rawest emotions are those that have been twisted, cut, and exposed to the world in all their ugly glory. Beauty lies in that exposure, in the stripping away of all pretense.\"\n\n*There’s a pause, a rustling sound as if the patient is adjusting in his seat.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Take Lori, for example. She was…unremarkable, really. Just another cog in the machine, but she had a talent, you see—a talent for cruelty. It wasn’t overt, no. That would have been too easy. She was subtle, a master of the offhand comment, the well-timed sneer, the small, cutting remarks that dig deep and fester.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice remains steady, almost affectionate, as he continues.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I decided Lori needed to be…transformed. Her cruelty couldn’t be allowed to simply exist without purpose. It had to be captured and immortalized in a way that reflected its true nature. That’s when I knew what I had to do.\"\n\n*There’s a faint sound, like a breath being drawn, as if the patient is savoring the memory.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It took time, of course. Precision is key in these matters. I followed her for weeks, observing and studying her every move and every interaction. I had to understand her completely to capture her essence in my work. When the moment was right, I invited her over. She thought it was a date—how naive. She never saw it coming.\"\n\n*The voice recorder crackles slightly as the patient’s tone darkens, a chilling edge creeping in.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I started with her lips. That was where her venom lived, after all. Every word, every insult, came from those lips. I removed them carefully, preserving the shape and the texture. Each slice was a stroke of the brush, each drop of blood a splash of color. The pain…oh, doctor, the pain was exquisite. It was the medium through which the art took shape.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice becomes almost dreamy as if lost in the memory of the act.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I arranged the lips in a spiral, a chaotic, twisting pattern that mirrored the way her words wound their way into the minds of others, poisoning them. The spiral is endless, doctor, just like the damage she caused. It’s a perfect representation of her true self, laid bare for the world to see.\"\n\n*There’s another pause and the faint sound of the patient licking his lips.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But I didn’t stop there. Oh no, the lips were just the beginning. I stretched her skin, tanned it, and made it the canvas for my masterpiece. The spiral had to be framed, after all. The skin was so…pliant, so willing to be molded into something greater than itself.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice lowers, almost a whisper now.*\n\n**Patient:** \"In the end, she became something beautiful, something far more meaningful than she ever was in life. Her cruelty was her downfall, but it was also her salvation—through me, through my art. I immortalized her, doctor. She’ll never be forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n*The recording ends abruptly with a soft click, leaving a heavy silence in its wake.*\n\nI sat there, staring at the now silent voice recorder, my mind reeling from what I had just heard. The patient’s calm, almost reverent description of his crime, the horrifying detail with which he described his so-called \"art\"—it was unlike anything I had ever encountered before. The way he spoke about Lori, reducing her to nothing more than a canvas for his twisted masterpiece, made my skin crawl.\n\nI tried to rationalize it, to convince myself that it was just a story, a dark and disturbed fantasy recorded on a tape and forgotten over the years. But the vividness of the patient’s voice, the cold precision of his words—it all felt too real. I could almost see the horrific spiral he described, the lips meticulously arranged, each slice and cut a reflection of the cruelty he perceived.\n\nMy hands were trembling as I turned off the recorder, the click of the button echoing in the silent room. I felt a cold sweat on the back of my neck, my heartbeat loud in my ears. I needed to distance myself from what I’d just heard to shake off the suffocating weight that had settled on my chest.\n\nI got up and walked to the kitchen, pouring myself a glass of water, but my hands were still shaking so badly that I nearly spilled it. I forced myself to take slow, deep breaths, trying to calm the storm of thoughts raging in my mind. It was just a recording, I told myself. Just an old tape, the ramblings of a disturbed mind. But that did little to quell the unease that had taken root inside me.\n\nI decided to wind down before bed, hoping to push the grotesque images out of my head. I turned on the TV, trying to lose myself in a mindless show, but I couldn’t focus. No matter how hard I tried, the patient’s voice kept creeping back into my thoughts, repeating his chilling words, painting vivid, horrifying images in my mind.\n\nSleep was elusive that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the spiral of lips, the stretched skin, and the patient’s cold, calculating hands creating his monstrous art. I tossed and turned, my mind racing, unable to escape the dark corners it had wandered into. When I did manage to drift off, it was only to be jolted awake by nightmares I couldn’t fully remember, but it left me drenched in sweat, my heart pounding.\n\nMorning came too soon. The weak light filtering through the blinds felt harsh, and I dragged myself out of bed, exhausted and unsettled. I tried to push the recording out of my mind as I went through the motions of getting ready for work, but it clung to me like a shadow. The entire day at the office, I was distracted, my thoughts constantly drifting back to the tapes, wondering what other horrors they might contain.\n\nBy the time I got home, I was mentally and physically drained, but there was a strange pull drawing me back to the box of tapes. I tried to resist, to tell myself that I needed to rest, to clear my mind of the gruesome images that had plagued me all day. But curiosity, or maybe something darker, got the better of me.\n\nI barely dropped my bag on the floor before I found myself sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the box. My fingers hovered over the tapes, each one labeled with another name, another story. Despite everything, I felt a compulsion to know more, to hear what else the patient had to say.\n\nWith a mixture of dread and morbid curiosity, I reached for the next tape. Michael 1987 was the next in the timeline. My heart pounded in my chest as I placed it in the recorder, my hand trembling slightly as I pressed play.\n\n\n\n*Recorder clicks on. The familiar static hums before the patient’s voice begins, calm and composed as ever.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Michael... Michael was a master of manipulation. He knew how to twist people like me, how to pull their strings without us ever realizing. He was charming, yes, but beneath that charm was something dark—a need to control, to dominate, to make others dance to his tune. He enjoyed it, doctor. He thrived on it.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, letting the silence stretch out as if savoring the memory.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But even a master puppeteer has his strings. It was time for Michael to understand what it felt like to be the puppet rather than the one holding the controls. I wanted him to feel every tug, every pull, every ounce of pain that his manipulations had caused. So I turned him into exactly what he was—a marionette.\"\n\n*There’s a faint sound, like the patient is shifting in his seat, preparing to recount the details.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It was meticulous work, doctor. Every string, every hook had to be placed just right. I used fishing line—strong enough to hold him, thin enough to dig deep into his flesh with every movement. His hands, his feet, his joints—they all had their own lines, each one leading up to a pulley on the ceiling. And the more he struggled, the tighter those lines would pull.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on a tone of satisfaction as if admiring a completed masterpiece.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But I wasn’t finished. Michael had always been so proud of his voice, the way he could talk his way out of anything, twist words to suit his needs. So I silenced him, just as he had silenced so many others through his deceit. A simple gag but effective. It was... poetic, really.\"\n\n*There’s a soft chuckle, almost affectionate.*\n\n**Patient:** \"And then the final touch—a mirror, placed right in front of his face. I wanted him to see what he had become. To watch as he was transformed into the very thing he’d made of others—a puppet, dangling from strings he could no longer control.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice lowers, becoming almost a whisper.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I left him there, doctor. Hanging, twitching, every movement pulling those lines tighter and tighter. He wanted control... I gave it to him. But not in the way he expected.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a click, leaving the room in silence once more, the weight of the patient’s words hanging in the air.*\n\n\n\nAs the recorder clicked off, I sat there, stunned by the gruesome details of what I’d just heard. The patient’s calm recounting of how he turned Michael into a twisted marionette, forced to watch his own body become a puppet, left me sick to my stomach. This wasn’t just murder; it was a calculated, brutal transformation—a perverse work of \"art.\"\n\nI knew I should stop, put the tapes away, and try to forget. But I couldn’t shake the morbid curiosity gnawing at me, the need to know what came next. My eyes fell on the next tape in the box, labeled \"Karen - 1990.\" Despite every instinct telling me to leave it alone, I reached for the recorder, unable to resist.\n\nWith a shaky hand, I pressed play.\n\n\n\n*Recorder clicks on. The patient’s voice emerges, calm and deliberate, almost as if he’s discussing a simple art project.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Karen… Karen was driven by greed. She took everything she could get her hands on, always wanting more, never satisfied. She saw people as stepping stones, opportunities to be exploited. But greed is a hollow pursuit, doctor. It fills you up, but it’s never enough. It’s a hunger that consumes you.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, and there’s a faint rustling as if he’s reflecting on what he’s about to say.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I was just another opportunity for her. I had been through a rough patch—lost my job, was struggling to keep my head above water. Karen swooped in, pretending to help. She offered to 'invest' in a small business idea I had, something I thought could turn my life around. I trusted her… I believed she genuinely wanted to help me. But it was all a lie.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on a colder tone, his calm demeanor masking the underlying anger.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Karen didn’t care about helping me. She used her 'investment' as leverage to take everything. She drained my accounts, stole my ideas, and left me with nothing. I was ruined, left to watch as she took what little I had and turned it into her own success. She didn’t even look back, didn’t care about the wreckage she left behind.\"\n\n*There’s a brief silence, heavy with unspoken rage.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I wanted her to feel the emptiness she created in others, the hollow void her greed left behind. So, I made sure she would never take anything from anyone again.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice drops to a near whisper as he describes what he did next.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I began by cutting open her chest, carefully removing everything inside. I hollowed her out, leaving nothing but a shell—just like how she hollowed out the lives of those she exploited. Inside that hollow, I placed gold coins, jewels, and scraps of fine fabric—symbols of the wealth and status she so desperately craved. But it wasn’t just about the objects, doctor; it was about what they represented. They were as empty and meaningless as she was.\"\n\n*The patient’s tone becomes more intense, filled with a twisted satisfaction.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I then forced her hands to clutch the edges of her open chest, sewing her fingers into her flesh so she could never let go of the wealth she sought, even in death. Her fingers bled as the thread tightened, but that only added to the piece. It showed the pain of her greed, the suffering she caused in her endless pursuit of more.\"\n\n*The patient pauses again, seemingly savoring the memory.*\n\n**Patient:** \"And to ensure she could never see or speak of her crimes, I gilded her eyes and mouth with gold leaf. Her eyes were blinded by the very thing she lived for, and her mouth was sealed, silenced by the lies and deceit she spread. The final piece was a grotesque treasure chest, a hollow shell of a woman clutching at the empty promises of wealth, forever blind and mute.\"\n\n*The patient chuckles softly, a chilling sound in the otherwise silent room.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It’s poetic, really. Karen, forever clutching the empty promises of wealth, never to be satisfied, never to see or speak of what really mattered. Just like she was in life.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a final click, leaving a heavy silence in its wake.*\n\n\n\nI sat there, the silence pressing in on me like a weight. My mind spun as I tried to process what I had just heard on Karen's tape, the gruesome details of what the patient had done to her. But even as the horror settled in, another part of me, almost mechanical, reached for the next tape in the box.\n\nMy hand trembled as I placed it into the recorder, the label *\"James - 1992\"* staring back at me like a challenge. I hesitated, my mind still reeling from the twisted art that was Karen. But the pull of the next story was too strong to resist. I had to know what came next, what fresh hell the patient had created this time.\n\nWith a deep breath, I pressed play, the tape spinning to life, and braced myself for whatever was about to unfold.\n\n\n\n*The tape begins with the usual crackle of static, followed by the patient’s voice, calm and cold, devoid of any emotion.*\n\n**Patient:** \"James... He was always the one everyone admired. The golden boy. Successful, charming, the kind of person who could walk into a room and make everyone feel small. He thrived on it, you know—being the center of attention, the one who was always just a little bit better, a little bit higher. He knew it, too, and he made sure I knew it. Every chance he got, he’d remind me of how much better he was. How much more he had.\"\n\n*There’s a pause, a faint rustling sound as if the patient is shifting in his seat.*\n\n**Patient:** \"But no one is invincible, doctor. No one is truly above anyone else. I wanted James to see that, to understand what it’s like to be brought down, to be less. So, I did what had to be done.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on a darker, more intense tone as he begins to describe his work.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I started with his limbs. He was always so strong, always using his power to control others, to make them feel weak. So, I took that power away. I removed his arms and his legs, piece by piece. Each cut was deliberate, each slice a reminder that no one is untouchable. I preserved those limbs, arranged them around his torso like a crown—a twisted symbol of the superiority he always believed he had.\"\n\n*There’s a brief silence, heavy with the weight of what comes next.*\n\n**Patient:** \"His face… the source of his charm, his confidence. I couldn’t leave it untouched. I flayed the skin from his face, careful not to damage those perfect features. I stretched the skin across a frame made from his own bones, turning it into a mask—a mask that would forever look down on what he had become. But the real work was in his torso.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice becomes almost reverent as if describing a masterpiece.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I hollowed him out, doctor. I removed everything inside, every organ, every trace of what made him whole. And then, I lined the cavity with shards of glass. Broken mirrors, each piece reflecting a different angle, a different part of whoever looked inside. It wasn’t just about hollowing him out; it was about making sure that anyone who saw it would see themselves in his place. They’d see their own envy, their own insecurities, reflected back at them. Just like James always made me feel.\"\n\n*The patient pauses his tone now, almost admiring as he describes the completed work.*\n\n**Patient:** \"The final piece, doctor, was something to behold. Imagine this: James, stripped of everything that made him powerful, his limbs severed and arranged around him like a grotesque crown. His torso, hollowed out, filled with nothing but broken glass and reflections—empty, yet filled with echoes of what he was. His face, stretched and displayed above like a mask of his former self, looking down on the hollow shell he had become. The entire structure, standing in stark contrast to the man he once was, now a monument to his own emptiness.\"\n\n**Patient:** \"It was... perfect. A reminder that those who think they stand above others, those who build themselves up by tearing others down, are often the most hollow of all. And now, that’s all James will ever be—a reflection of what he could never truly achieve, trapped in a frame of his own making.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a soft click, leaving a lingering sense of unease in the silence that follows.*\n\n\n\nAs the tape clicked off, I found myself frozen, my fingers still resting on the recorder. The horrific image of James’s final form haunted me, a grotesque monument to his own vanity and power. But as much as it repulsed me, I couldn’t shake the need to hear more.\n\nIt wasn’t just curiosity—it was something deeper, something darker. I felt an inexplicable pull, an urge to uncover the next piece of this twisted puzzle. My hand moved on its own, reaching into the box for the next tape. I barely registered the label—*“Susan - 1994”*—before I had it in the recorder.\n\nWithout thinking, I pressed play, the tape spinning as the static filled the room once more.\n\n\n\n*The tape begins with a crackle, followed by the patient’s voice, colder and more detached than before.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Susan... She was everything to me. My love, my partner, the one I trusted above all others. I thought she was my world, doctor. But love—real love—doesn’t hide secrets. It doesn’t creep behind closed doors and whisper lies. No, Susan was something else entirely. She wore the mask of love, but behind it, she was nothing more than a deceitful animal.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, as if letting the weight of his words settle before continuing.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I discovered the truth—how she betrayed me with someone I considered a friend. It wasn’t just infidelity, doctor. It was the deepest betrayal, a knife in my back, twisted by the hands I once held with such affection. She wasn’t human to me anymore after that. She was something less, something... animalistic in her betrayal.\"\n\n*There’s a rustling sound, the patient adjusting in his seat as he begins to describe his work.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I wanted to show the duality of her nature—the face she showed the world, and the ugly truth beneath. I began by splitting her face down the middle. On one side, I left her untouched, beautiful, serene. The other side, though, I stripped away the flesh, exposing the muscle and bone. It’s incredible, doctor, how different someone looks when their true self is revealed. The face of a lover turned into the visage of a monster.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice grows more intense as he describes the process.*\n\n**Patient:** \"Her hands, those hands that had touched me with such tenderness, were tainted. I severed each finger at the knuckle, then reattached them, but not as they were. I twisted them, bent them, made them something unnatural—just like her touch had become. Each finger now points in different directions, a grotesque parody of what they once were.\"\n\n*He pauses again, as if reliving the creation of his \"art.\"*\n\n**Patient:** \"Her body... I posed it in an embrace, as if she were reaching out for someone, but her arms, her legs—they’re not right anymore. I broke her limbs, twisted them back like an animal’s, bent at unnatural angles. Her legs... they’re bent backward now, just like a beast. She’s forever trapped in that moment of betrayal, trying to flee but never able to escape.\"\n\n*The patient’s tone softens, becoming almost reflective.*\n\n**Patient:** \"And then, the final touch—a mirror. I placed it before her, angled so that anyone who looks upon her sees both sides at once. The beautiful lie and the grotesque truth, staring back at them. The reflection captures the essence of what she was—half the person I loved, and half the animal she became when she betrayed me.\"\n\n*He lets out a soft chuckle, devoid of humor.*\n\n**Patient:** \"It’s fitting, isn’t it? Susan, forever frozen in that moment, caught between what she pretended to be and what she truly was. A creature of deceit, trapped in a twisted, broken form, staring at the truth she could never admit.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a click, leaving behind a silence that feels heavier than before.*\n\n\n\nThe room was dark, save for the dim light of the lamp on the table, casting long shadows across the walls. The silence was thick, oppressive, yet my mind buzzed with the echoes of the patient’s words. The gruesome details of Susan’s \"art piece\" played over and over in my head, but there was no pause, no reflection—just an unrelenting pull to continue.\n\nI glanced at the clock; it was nearly midnight. The rational part of me knew I should stop, that I had work in the morning and desperately needed sleep. But that thought barely registered. My body moved on its own, as if driven by muscle memory. I reached for the next tape, barely noticing the label, my hand sliding it into the recorder with practiced ease.\n\nThere was no hesitation, no second thoughts. My thumb pressed down on the play button before I could even consider stopping, and the tape began to spin. The static filled the room once more, and I leaned in, already caught in the grip of the next story.\n\n\n\n*The tape begins with the familiar crackle of static, followed by the patient’s voice, calm and measured, though there’s an undercurrent of something darker, more personal.*\n\n**Patient:** \"David… He was a friend, or at least, that’s what I believed. We shared everything—secrets, laughs, dreams. I trusted him. I never thought he’d be the one to drive a knife so deep into my back. But he did, and not just any knife, doctor. He took what was most precious to me, twisted it, and left me to bleed out from the inside. He wasn’t just a betrayer; he was a thief of trust, a destroyer of hearts.\"\n\n*The patient pauses, a soft, almost reflective sigh escaping before he continues.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I knew I couldn’t rush this one. No, I needed time to think, to let the pain simmer, to make sure that what I created would be… fitting. I wanted him to understand, to feel the weight of what he had done. And so, I began with the heart.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice takes on a more intense tone, as he describes the process in vivid detail.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I cut open his chest, just as he had cut open my life. But instead of removing the heart, I encased it in a thick layer of resin, clear and unbreakable. It was still there, still visible, but unreachable. Just like the love and trust he had shattered. His hands, the hands that had reached for what wasn’t his, I severed them. Then, I reattached them, clawing desperately at the encased heart, trying to hold onto what he could never truly have. The resin was too strong, doctor, just as my resolve had become.\"\n\n*There’s a pause, the sound of the patient adjusting in his seat as if savoring the memory.*\n\n**Patient:** \"His mouth… I sewed it shut. The lies, the deceit, the false friendship—all silenced. Above his mouth, I carved a single word: 'BETRAYER.' It’s what he was, and it’s what he will forever be known as. His voice, once so smooth and convincing, would never utter another word of betrayal.\"\n\n*The patient’s voice softens, almost reverent as he describes the final details.*\n\n**Patient:** \"I placed him on his knees, forced him into a position of submission, where he belongs. The weight of his encased heart dragged his hands downward, pulling at his chest, making him appear as though he was sinking into the very ground he had sullied with his betrayal. His eyes, wide open, forever staring at the word carved into his flesh, unable to escape the truth of what he had done.\"\n\n*The patient’s tone becomes almost philosophical, as if reflecting on the deeper meaning behind his work.*\n\n**Patient:** \"In the end, David is exactly what he made of himself—a man who reached too far, who took what wasn’t his, and who now pays the price in a hollow, eternal grasp for a heart he can never reclaim. He is the embodiment of betrayal, forever kneeling, forever silenced, forever marked.\"\n\n*The recording ends with a soft click, leaving a heavy, oppressive silence in the room.*\n\n\n\nI stared at the remaining tapes, my mind reeling from everything I had heard. There were only two left, both dated with a significant gap between them. The one I had just placed in the recorder was from 2010, and the other, sitting ominously at the bottom of the box, was from 2019. Nine years between them—what could have happened in that time?\n\nIt was 2 a.m., and the weight of exhaustion pressed down on me, but I couldn’t stop. I had to finish. There was no turning back now. I reached for the bottle of whiskey I’d grabbed earlier, pouring myself another glass. The warmth of the liquor did little to calm the unease growing in the pit of my stomach, but it gave me something to hold onto as I pressed play on the tape.\n\nThe static filled the room once more, and I took a slow sip of whiskey, bracing myself for whatever horror was about to unfold."},"770":{"title":"The fourth test","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f2ph5o\/the_fourth_test\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Confusedlemur77","selftext":"Experiment log #1\n\nDoctor smith.\n\nWe have begun testing on the first ever synthetic brain transplant.  After years of trial and error, we have finally created an artificial brain that reacts to electromagnetic stimulation.  We attempted to insert the brain into a recently deceased male, roughly 72 years of age.  The brain seemingly had no effect on the body, aside from some odd twitching.  However, upon removal of the brain, the body let out a ghastly wale before ceasing all activity.  We chalked it up to stimulation of the vocal chords caused by sloppy removal of the brain.\n\nExperiment log #2\n\nDoctor smith.\n\nWe obtained a younger cadaver, a female, roughly 42 years of age.  We were much more weary with the brain this time, carefully matching it with every nerve ending visible in the skull.  The twitching returned, but we kept going.  We connected several small cables to various neural pathways, and provided electronic stimulation to attempt a reaction.  Most did not Garner reactions, aside from one into the brain stem, which caused the body to blink frantically.  The strongest phenomenon is that the blinking appeared to be in a pattern resembling Morse code.  We removed the brain, and got the same ghastly wale from the last experiment.\n\nExperiment log #3\n\nDoctor smith.\n\nI have poured over the security footage of the last experiment numerous times, yet I still fail to understand what occured.  Upon inserting the brain into our new subject, a deceased male, 53 years of age, there was no twitching like before, rather, it sat up on the table.  It did not move for another 5 minutes as we all watched it.  Upon getting closer to test for what could have caused the sudden movement, the subjects arms began moving upwards towards its face.  It then began to force its fingers into its eyes, until they burst with a sickening pop.  Those of us who stayed after that remember it attempting to speak, it's words coming out with a hoarse, rough, breathy tone.  It spoke for roughly 2 minutes, repeating the same words.  Dark, help, hurts, why, pain.  After 2 minutes, it's simply ripped the brain out of its head, and let it roll onto the floor.  I am not a religious man by any means, but I can't help but fear what we are doing.  This brain never had a consciousness or, as some would say, a soul.  I didn't believe this explanation until I deciphered the morse code from the last experiment.  It simply said, empty.  I don't believe I can go through with the next experiment tomorrow.  The problems are getting worse and worse everytime we insert the synthetic brain into a new body.  To whoever is reading this, do not attempt to go through with the next experiment.\n\nExperiment log #4\n\nDoctor Peterson.\n\nThis experiment was a mistake.  We should have listened to doctor smith.  We inserted the brain into a still living man who volunteered.  Upon completion of the transplant, the patient sat up, then stood up from the table.  He grabbed the scalpel from the surgeon and stabbed it into her scalp, and began peeling back the skin on head.  Upon reaching the skull, he bashed at it with his fists until it broke.  He begin consuming bits of her brain, which caused many of us to be sick to our stomachs.  Security attempted to apprehend the patient, but it seemed like it couldn't feel pain.  Despite it's left leg being broken by a baton, it kept moving, now making a disgusting combination of squishing and crunching sounds.  The two guards met the same end as the surgeon.  The patient then proceeded to walk out the door, it's leg still broken, and noticed us in the observation area.

We were kids, invincible and fearless, and we didn’t heed the warnings of the adults who told us to stay away.\n\nOur group was tight-knit: Josh, the brave leader who always took charge; Luke, the troublemaker with a knack for finding himself in sticky situations; Marissa, the goth girl who acted tough but had a heart of gold; Angela, the preppy girl who somehow managed to stay immaculate even in the dustiest of places; Colten, the dim-witted but friendly boy who always had a smile on his face; Jewells, the sweetest girl I knew, with a smile that could light up even the darkest room; and then there was me, an ordinary kid with an extraordinary crush on Jewells.\n\nWe called our game “Shadow Seekers.” It was a twist on hide and seek, played in the darkness of the decrepit, abandoned building. The thrill of hiding in the shadows, the anticipation of being found, and the adrenaline rush of darting from one hiding spot to another made it our favorite summer pastime.\n\nOne particular evening, the air was thick with the scent of impending rain, and the building seemed darker than usual. We gathered in the main hall, flashlights in hand, as Josh explained the rules for the umpteenth time.\n\n“Alright, Shadow Seekers,” Josh said, his voice echoing through the hollow space, “you know the drill. One person seeks, the rest hide. Stay within the building and no cheating.”\n\n“Like you don’t cheat,” Luke muttered, earning a playful punch from Josh.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, keep telling yourself that,” Josh shot back with a grin. “Anyway, Angela, you’re it.”\n\nAngela rolled her eyes. “Fine, but you better not hide in the same boring places. I’m getting tired of finding you all behind the same boxes and doors.”\n\nWe scattered, the sound of our footsteps mingling with Angela’s counting. I found myself drawn to a room on the second floor I hadn’t explored before. The door creaked as I pushed it open, and I slipped inside, my flashlight barely piercing the darkness.\n\nI turned it off and settled into a corner, my heart pounding. As the seconds stretched into minutes, I listened to the distant sounds of Angela’s search, punctuated by occasional laughter or startled yelps.\n\nThen, I heard it—a faint whisper. “Hey.”\n\nI tensed, straining my ears. “Jewells?” I whispered back.\n\n“Yeah, it’s me,” came her soft reply. “Don’t worry, Angela won’t find us here.”\n\nI couldn’t see her, but her presence was comforting. “Why are you hiding with me?” I asked, trying to keep my voice low.\n\n“I just wanted to talk,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “It’s so hard to get a moment alone with you. You’re always surrounded by everyone.”\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. “I… I like being around you,” I admitted, my face growing warm even in the dark.\n\n“I like being around you too,” she said, and I could almost hear her smile. “You’re different from the others. You’re kind.”\n\nI was about to respond when the door creaked open, and the beam of Angela’s flashlight swept through the room. I held my breath, but the light didn’t find us, and soon it disappeared as Angela moved on.\n\nJewells sighed. “I wish we could stay here forever.”\n\n“Me too,” I whispered, feeling an inexplicable sadness wash over me.\n\nWe sat in silence, the darkness enveloping us. After what felt like hours, the game ended, and we rejoined the group downstairs. Angela had found everyone except me and Jewells, but no one questioned our absence. We all parted ways, promising to meet again the next evening.\n\nThat night, I couldn’t get Jewells’ words out of my mind. There had been a strange finality to them, a wistfulness that gnawed at my heart. I tossed and turned, finally falling into a fitful sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I was woken by the sound of my mom’s frantic voice. “Have you seen Jewells?” she asked, her face pale with worry.\n\n“No, why?” I asked, a sinking feeling in my stomach.\n\n“She didn’t come home last night,” my mom said, her voice trembling. “Her parents are out looking for her.”\n\nI felt a cold dread settle over me as I remembered our conversation in the dark. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it. Jewells had been with me—hadn’t she?\n\nThe day passed in a blur of police sirens and whispered rumors. By evening, the news broke: Jewells had been found. Her body was discovered in a ditch off the highway, a few miles from the abandoned building. She had been kidnapped and murdered.\n\nI felt like the ground had been pulled out from under me. How could this be? I had talked to her, heard her voice, felt her presence. It didn’t make sense.\n\nThat night, I went back to the building, driven by an urge I couldn’t explain. I found the room where we had hidden and sat in the darkness, waiting.\n\nHours passed, and then I heard it again—a faint whisper. “Hey.”\n\nMy heart pounded. “Jewells?” I whispered, my voice trembling.\n\n“I’m here,” she replied, her voice sad and distant. “I didn’t want to leave you. I wanted to stay with you.”\n\nTears filled my eyes. “I miss you,” I choked out. “Why did this happen?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said, her voice breaking. “I was scared, and then… then it was over. But I’m still here, with you.”\n\nWe talked for what felt like hours, her voice growing fainter with each passing minute. As dawn approached, I felt a cold dread settle over me.\n\n“I have to go,” Jewells said softly. “I can’t stay much longer.”\n\n“No,” I begged. “Please don’t leave me.”\n\n“I’ll always be with you,” she whispered. “In your heart.”\n\nAnd then she was gone. The room was silent, the darkness overwhelming.\n\nI stumbled home, my mind a whirl of emotions. The days that followed were a haze of grief and disbelief. I attended Jewells’ funeral, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still with me, watching over me.\n\nOur group never played Shadow Seekers again. The building stood abandoned, a silent witness to our childhood and the tragedy that shattered it.\n\nYears passed, and I grew up, but the memory of that summer stayed with me. Jewells’ voice still echoed in my mind, a reminder of the bond we shared and the pain of losing her.\n\nI moved away from our small town after high school, going to college in a distant city and starting a new life. I made new friends, had new experiences, but Jewells’ memory was a constant shadow in the back of my mind. It was something I rarely talked about, even to my closest friends. It was too painful, too personal.\n\nOne summer, nearly a decade later, I returned to my hometown for a visit. My parents still lived in the same house, and the town hadn’t changed much. It felt like stepping back in time, like the years that had passed were just a fleeting dream.\n\n“Hey, look who’s back!” Josh’s voice called out one afternoon. He was sitting on his porch, a cold beer in hand, his face lighting up with a smile as he saw me.\n\n“Josh!” I greeted him warmly, a mix of nostalgia and happiness washing over me. “It’s been too long, man.”\n\nHe handed me a beer and we sat down, catching up on old times. He still had that same confident aura about him, though there was a hint of something more somber in his eyes.\n\n“Remember Shadow Seekers?” he asked, a wistful smile playing on his lips.\n\nI nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. “How could I forget?”\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the weight of unspoken memories hanging heavy between us. Finally, Josh broke the silence.\n\n“I still think about Jewells,” he admitted quietly. “I think we all do.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said softly. “Me too.”\n\nThat night, lying in my childhood bed, I found myself unable to sleep. The past seemed to press in on me, the memories of those carefree days mixed with the tragedy that had shattered them. I felt an inexplicable urge to visit the old building, to face the ghosts of my past.\n\nThe next morning, I called the old gang together. Josh, Luke, Marissa, Angela, Colten—they all agreed to meet me at the abandoned building. It felt like old times, though the air was tinged with a sense of solemnity.\n\nWhen we arrived, the building looked more dilapidated than ever. Vines had overgrown the walls, and the windows were shattered, the interior filled with debris and decay.\n\n“I can’t believe this place is still standing,” Marissa said, her voice filled with a mix of awe and sadness.\n\n“Feels like yesterday we were playing here,” Angela added, her eyes scanning the familiar surroundings.\n\nWe entered the building together, the creaking floorboards echoing our steps. Memories flooded back—of laughter, of hiding in the shadows, of Jewells’ voice.\n\nWe made our way to the room where I had last heard Jewells, the place where I had felt her presence so strongly. It looked just as I remembered, the corners still cloaked in darkness, the air thick with dust.\n\n“Why are we here?” Luke asked, his usual bravado tinged with uncertainty.\n\n“I don’t know,” I admitted. “I just… I feel like I need to be here. Like there’s something unresolved.”\n\nAs we stood there, a sudden chill filled the room, and I felt a familiar presence. My heart pounded in my chest, a mix of fear and longing.\n\n“Jewells?” I whispered, my voice trembling.\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath. Then, faintly, I heard it—the soft, familiar whisper.\n\n“Hey.”\n\nMy eyes widened, and I saw the expressions of my friends mirror my shock. They heard it too.\n\n“Jewells?” Josh called out, his voice strong but tinged with emotion.\n\nBut there was no response. The air grew colder, and a faint glow appeared in the corner of the room. Slowly, Jewells’ form took shape—a ghostly figure, but unmistakably her.\n\nMy friends stood in stunned silence, unable to see or hear what I was experiencing. Jewells smiled at me, her eyes filled with sadness.\n\n“Why now?” I asked, tears streaming down my face. “Why are you here now?”\n\n“I needed to say goodbye,” Jewells replied. “I needed to tell you all that it’s okay to move on, to live your lives. I’ll always be with you, in your hearts.”\n\nAs Jewells’ form faded, my friends looked confused, sensing something but unable to grasp the full reality. I tried to explain, but words failed me.\n\nThat night, back at home, I found myself drawn to the old building once more. Alone, I made my way through the dark corridors, feeling a pull I couldn’t resist. I returned to the room where I had last seen Jewells, the air thick with an eerie silence.\n\nSuddenly, the room grew colder, and I felt a presence behind me. I turned to see Jewells, her form more solid than before, her eyes pleading.\n\n“Please, stay with me,” she whispered, her voice filled with a desperate longing.\n\n“Jewells, I can’t,” I said, my heart breaking. “I’m alive. I have to live.”\n\n“You don’t have to leave,” she insisted, stepping closer. “We can be together forever. You’ll never be alone again.”\n\nI felt a cold hand grasp mine, the touch sending a chill through my body. Her eyes, once filled with warmth, now glowed with an unnatural light. I tried to pull away, but her grip tightened, her desperation turning to something more sinister.\n\n“You can’t leave me,” she hissed, her voice no longer her own. “Stay. Stay with me forever.”\n\nTerror gripped me as I realized the truth. This wasn’t the Jewells I had known and loved. This was something else, something dark and malevolent. I struggled against her grip, my mind racing with fear.\n\n“No!” I shouted, breaking free and stumbling back. “I won’t stay!”\n\nJewells’ form twisted and contorted, her face a mask of rage and sorrow. “You’ll regret this,” she snarled, her voice echoing through the room. “You’ll never forget me.”\n\nI fled the building, my heart pounding, my mind filled with horror. As I ran, I felt her presence chasing me, a shadow that would haunt me for the rest of my days.\n\nYears later, I still hear her voice in the quiet moments, a whisper in the dark. The memory of that night, of the twisted love that tried to claim me, remains a scar on my soul. Jewells is gone, but the horror of that summer lingers, a reminder that some bonds, even in death, are never truly broken."},"773":{"title":"Help finding a story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f2txxc\/help_finding_a_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"watchout722","selftext":"I’m trying to find a creepy pasta.

These caves are in a very special particular spot, that even in the heat of the sun in its prime during the day, there is still enough shade to protect the vampires from the sunlight. These vampires are Christian and so our Islamic prayers and tools do no work on them. Our Islamic weapons like the quran only work on Muslim vampires. Also if we go into the caves carrying crosses and naming jesus in the name of Christianity, we will surely be beheaded by the Taliban. It's a weird situation to be in and I guess this is why the Christian vampires chose Afghanistan. \n\nThey have been killing our people and turning more people into vampires. If a Christian vampire bites someone, then that person will be a Christian vampire. If a Muslim vampire bites someone then that person will be a Muslim vampire, and so on. During the morning we have been trying to reflect sunlight into those caves and trying to make those Christian vampires convert to islam, so we could kill them through use of Islamic tools and not be beheaded. It is proving to be a difficult task. \n\nDuring the night it can be scary in Afghanistan and the vampires come out to play. They kill and turn people into vampires. Any vampires that we catch, we convert them to Islam and then kill them using Islamic tools. It's not enough though as the nest of vampires are in the caves. Those damn caves! and to think that I use to play in those caves as a child. I was so innocent and I'm sure my drawings are still there upon those walls. I wonder what the vampires think of them? The vampires are growing in numbers and we aren't killing enough.\n\nSo I gathered a gang who will dare to go into those caves during the day and by using Christian crosses and bibles, we will enter those caves and kill the nest of christian vampires. \n\nMy plan had worked and my team had survived and we killed the vampires living within those caves. Yes we used crosses and bibles as these vampires were Christian vampires. We didn't have enough time to convert the whole nest of vampires into Islam and then kill them using Islamic tools. \n\nThe Taliban had heard at we had done and now we are all going to be beheaded.

His days of being an adrenaline junkie cop were officially a thing of the past. Hence, Franklin Hill was a perfect fit for him. There wasn’t much in terms of actual crime in Franklin Hill, population nine hundred and sixty-six. It was a sleepy town during the day, and at night, it had the personality of a human in a medically induced coma. \nSome nights, looking out his car’s window, Archetti could imagine what it was like in the days of yonder. The days before Microsoft governed humankind from dusk till dawn, and high-speed internet had consolidated the world into videos of dancing cats and people getting packages stolen off their porches. \nArchetti could feel and almost taste the days when a horse and buggy would have sauntered down Franklin Hill’s central road of commerce, the horse kicking up clumps of dirt and dropping a massive dookie in the middle of the street as a man in a pit-stained white shirt and black bow tie chiseled the name of some recently departed soul into a gravestone.   \nHe also loved the time alone in his car, personal or the duly appointed vehicle of the F.H.P.D. The car was his own private snow globe. There was no fake snow or glitter, only a man and his thoughts. Archetti was still relatively new to the Franklin Hill police force—three months into the job, actually. A case in nearby Harveston had put an odious taste in his mouth and scarred his mind. He had tried to wash it out with a treadmill and a little talk therapy, but there wasn’t a Listerine strong enough to alleviate the grotesque images of that case from his psyche. \nArchetti needed a fresh start—a semi-clean slate. He knew the pictures from the FM Killer case would haunt him forever, but not seeing the landmarks that triggered high blood pressure and night terrors would give him what a psychologist, Leon Festinger, in 1957 branded as cognitive dissonance. But he wasn’t a naive duncehead either. He knew a change of scenery wouldn’t heal his mind like some magic pill. There was a golden truth in an old joke he’d heard: what do you call an asshole from Philly whose plane lands in Wichita, Kansas? An asshole in Wichita. Ba dum tss.\nWhen Archetti read that Franklin Hill was doing a mass hire in an email he received from LinkedIn and offering an attractive signing bonus for experienced cops, he updated his resume, submitted it via the F.H.P.D. online portal, and interviewed with Leonard Nash, the Chief of Police. Nash hired him on the spot. With salary and benefits secured, Archetti and his wife, Candice, sold their home, pocketed a few grand, and with their two children, Ava, 12, and Marshall, 8, moved into a sturdy three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath Carolina Blue split-level home on Moyamensing Court. \nIt was an upgrade over their two-bedroom, one-bathroom rambler in Harveston. Ava was over the moon to have her own room, and Candice was thrilled to have her own bathroom. Archetti was optimistic the sprawling backyard would give Marshall, who had a mild case of Asperger’s, a healthy push to spend more time outside than in front of a computer screen, slaughtering digital zombies for hours on end. \nThe first night in their new home, Archetti slept like a baby. The kids truly enjoyed their new school. And Candice found a part-time job at the Franklin Hill Library, reading to a gaggle of preschoolers in the morning. Archetti felt he had achieved the impossible. He had paved a road that sanded down the macabre edges of the horror in Harveston and improved the quality of his family’s life without uprooting them completely. \nMission accomplished, Don. You deserve all the best husband and dad in the world coffee mugs. It was a cruel flip of the cards when Archetti’s “mission accomplished” became tantamount to George W. Bush’s mission accomplished and not Neil Armstrong’s mission accomplished. \nArchetti turned onto North Center Street and gawked at the rows of boutique shops; their lights turned off for the evening. The town’s primary source of local dollars came from its antique or vintage apparel shops, but there was a glaring issue Archetti voiced at the dinner table and never in public—they all sold the same shit. The shops ran the risk of cannibalizing each other, turning downtown into a ghost town.\nN. Center Street’s lone final-boss corporation was a Starbucks on the corner, but even they had a limited-hours schedule. It closed at 7 pm, unlike the chain's sister stores in Whitman’s Mill and Harveston, which closed at nine. Archetti cruised by the Starbucks and slammed on the brakes. He looked back, eyes wide, not believing what he’d seen. He shifted into reverse and backed up a few feet. His brakes screeched up and down the vacant street. Vacant sans for one man (and not Archetti). A man whose green pajama bottoms and underpants lay around his ankles, his pale white ass framed in a John Carpenter-eque wide shot of the cruiser’s headlights. \nThe man was urinating on the sidewalk below the Starbucks sign. \nArchetti stared at the stream of piss splashing the concrete; it was an unnatural, radiating, opaque blue color. The man was so cavalier about his public exposure that it appeared he zealously believed all the world was his toilet and that relieving himself in his birthday suit was a God-given right. Or maybe he had taken too many hits of acid or smoked PCP-laced marijuana. \nArchetti shifted into the park and exited his cruiser. He slammed the door as hard as he could, hoping to spook the urinator. The man didn’t flinch a muscle and continued pissing. Archetti checked the time on his Apple Watch. It was 3 am. \nThe closer Archetti got to the man, a snippet of song lyrics from a band he couldn’t remember the name of played in his head—my suggestion is to keep your distance because right now I’m dangerous. But the dangerous man wasn’t Archetti; it was the emaciated fellow holding his dick and saturating the ground like a garden hose. Pulling his flashlight from his belt, Archetti raised it and aimed it at the man. He could smell the bodily waste. And it was dissimilar to anything Archetti had smelled in his lifetime: bitter, saccharine, and vaguely petrol.\nAbove, the night sky was cloudless, and the stars were out like Cherry Blossoms in spring, shimmering vibrantly. It was a summer evening, and the humidity had broken earlier in the day after a June monsoon barreled through. The air was light and comfortable to breathe. Regretfully, it made the odor of the man’s piddle party exponentially repulsive. How long had this urchin been draining his trouser snake? And where the fuck had he come from? \n“Hey, man,” Archetti said. “You okay?” \n“No.” \n“You drunk?” \n“No.” \n“I’m gonna need you to pick up your pants, sir,” Archetti said, the flashlight shaking in his hand. \nHe tried to angle it on the man’s face, but the man turned his head away from the light. The man had spontaneous patches of brown hair on the back of his head, but Archetti couldn't tell if the hair had fallen out or been shaved. The depilated spots had lumpy and blistering sores the size of quarters. They were oozy and pink and looked incredibly painful. Archetti had been briefed a month ago about a new drug, TranqX, that was hot on the streets. It turned people’s flesh alligator hard and black wherever they injected it. Users also entered into a state of inertia. Some people on TranqX were observed swaying like a flimsy tree in an ocean breeze for ten hours with their mouths open, their lips moving, but not saying a damn word. \nBut this man was speaking and tallying up what Archetti asked him, though he hadn’t hiked up his britches yet. And who injects drugs into their scalp? That’s not a thing. Even for a no-hope junkie with all their injection sites dried up.\nThe man finally ceased urinating, much to Archetti’s relief. Slowly, the man turned his head and the two locked eyes. To Archetti, the man’s features were unremarkable. He was a very generic-looking white male, vanilla cake with no icing. But there was a reservoir of despair in his gray eyes. The kind of eyes a dog desperate to be adopted has in those noon-time PSA commercials that beg for your money while a melancholy mid-90s piano ballad tries to milk every tear out of you (and dollar from your wallet). \n“I need… I need… I need… help,” The man said in a stunted and fragile voice. \n“With your pants?” Archetti asked back, but the man shook his head no.\nArchetti had confirmed the man’s problems went football fields beyond his exposed southern border. He took a step forward, his free hand moving down to his taser if he needed it. Should I call for backup? Fuck. It’s just one guy. Soaking wet, he can’t be more than a buck forty. And he appears… calm… \n“Do you have a name, sir?” \n“Reese,” he said, stuttering like he was chilled to the bone and pushing the double vowels through his chapped lips like a rock singer elongating a word to fill dead space in a song. “My full name is Reese Cameron.”\n“Do you live around here, Mr. Cameron?”\n“Don’t call me that!” Reese shrieked at Archetti, his pupils shaking with righteous anger. \nArchetti pulled his taser and aimed it at Reese. Archetti could feel his heart beating in his ears, fast and strong. He ordered Reese to put his hands in the air, and Reese complied. The man’s penis had shrunk in size and was coiling back into the space between Reese’s belly button and the base of his groin. Archetti thought he was watching some sort of perverted magic trick. The man with the disappearing cock! Coming to a town near you! But Archetti agreed with Reese’s self-assessment. He needed help. Archetti’s job was to protect and serve, and the last thing he wanted to do was put Franklin Hill P.D. in the news cycle because he led with force instead of compassion. \nReese was given two options. 1. Archetti tosses him a pair of handcuffs, and Reese cuffs himself. Next, they get in Archetti’s cruiser and drive to the precinct peacefully. If those things came to pass, Archetti promised he’d let Reese off with a warning and get him medical attention. Or 2. Reese doesn’t take the handcuffs, and Archetti calls for backup, escalating the situation. Archetti flintily warned Reese he would be looking at a hefty fine for his public indecency and possible jail time in the county pen. Archetti also divulged that the conditions inside Fogger County Penitentiary had declined significantly since Covid and was still nowhere near recovery. Bad food. Bad sleep. And the high likelihood of dying from disease or murder. It was a hostile hotel Reese wanted no part of, and option numero uno was the best prospect. \nThey drove to the precinct. Archetti let Reese sit in the passenger seat. He wanted to show Reese he didn’t consider him a clear and present danger. But Reese’s hands were cuffed and resting in his lap, and his pants… Thank Christ… were secured around his waist. Archetti’s pupils would flick to the side, evaluating the parcel he needed to deliver. In millisecond glances, he tried to visually absorb the details of the corpulent sores on the back of Reese’s head. Using the laws of natural deduction, Archetti circumstantially intuited Reese was receiving chemotherapy. That would also explain the toxic color and smell of his urine. But he couldn’t simply ask Reese if he was in a battle with the BIG C. \nA person’s battle with cancer is a personal war, a personal hell that Archetti had no point of reference for. He took three seconds to pray he never would. Besides, protecting and serving meant keeping boundaries. Get too personal, get too buddy-buddy, and Archetti knew he risked putting himself and his family in danger. Not tonight, not in Franklin Hill, my new and awesome home. Then came the thoughts Archetti feared the most. Remember Harveston. The way those kids' faces were ripped clean off the bone. \nThe car was uncomfortably quiet, and Reese gazed out the window with a thunderstruck look in his eyes. Archetti checked the clock; it was 3:45 am. After a four-way stop, they passed a Wawa—it was closed—but the super-illuminated LED red sign shone like a lighthouse’s first lens. Reese pointed to the sign, rattling the chains between his skinny wrists. The rattling boosted Archetti’s heart rate. After a few soothing breaths, he was right as rain.  \n“You like Wawa, Reese?” Archetti asked, then admonished himself for talking to Reese like a child.  \n“It’s Indian,” Reese said. “The Ojibwe people. In their language, it means wild goose. They were part of the Council of Three Fires. Birchbark canoes and mining copper is how they made their living. They lived around here.”\n“Are you a History teacher?” Archetti asked, curious to know how Reese accrued this knowledge.\n“No,” Reese said. “My great-grandmother had Ojibwe blood. She was half Ojibwe, half whatever white man raped her and called her his wife was. When the gas stations started popping up, she hated the sight of it. It’d make her sick in the breadbasket, she’d say. She thought the people who picked the store's name picked it because it sounded catchy. Maybe it does. I don’t know. It was another piece of her heritage being stolen from her.” \n“It sounds like she had a strong constitution,” Archetti said. \n“She did. Until she committed suicide on her 93rd birthday.”\nArchetti’s Adam’s Apple dropped to his breadbasket. He felt like an asshole. The biggest asshole in the state of Pennsylvania, stirring up heartache and unwanted memories. Archetti included the quack Dr. Mehmet Oz on the list, and he still had himself in first place in the M.A.L., the Major Asshole League. That’s how rueful he was about the remark. The cruiser plummeted back into silence, and to snap the insufferable sound of Archetti’s faux pas, he mumbled under his breath, “Wa-Wa.” \n“It is catchy,” Reese said.  \n“I’m sorry about the loss of your great-grandmother. I shouldn’t—”\n“You didn’t know,” Reese said. “Too many of us thinking we know. When what we really know is fuck all nothing about anything.” \nArchetti chuckled, agreeing with Reese’s candid outlook on the human condition. Through his laughter, Archetti said, “Why the Starbucks? Are you, like, one of those anti-union saboteurs? Let me guess: Starbucks is paying you to freak out the employees. Make them have second thoughts about going all in on the collective bargaining contract?” \nArchetti waited for his answer as he pulled up to a red light and laid on the brakes. The cruiser stopped and idled. There was nothing but blackness in all directions, and a brindled fog rolled in low off Moyamensing Pond. The laughter faded, and the muscular hum of the cruiser’s V8 engine replaced it. Archetti and Reese were three miles from the F.H.P.D. Precinct. It was a diminutive, boxy brick building constructed before World War I with one holding cell and a coffee maker from Clinton's America, brewing the worst cups of morning jolt Archetti ever tasted. \nArchetti looked over at Reese. He still hadn't answered, and the growling engine clawed at Archetti’s nerves. It was like Reese's mouth had suddenly filled with glue. Archetti saw the bubbly and grotesque orbs on Reese’s head pulsing, the skin inflating and deflating. Archetti’s stomach was a swingset bustling with youngsters, and all the youngsters were wildly pumping their legs because the kid who swung the fastest won a free PlayStation 5. Reese’s eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he went into herky-jerky convulsions. Shit! Archetti assumed Reese was having a seizure, and the vibrating sores were a symptom of his nerve endings failing to transmit correctly. Archetti clicked out of his seatbelt and climbed over the cruiser’s console. He was inches from Reese’s nose, staring into the whites of his eyeballs. \n“Talk to me, Reese!” Archetti yelled. \nHe worried Reese would bite his tongue off. Archetti had to pry open Reese’s tightly clamped jaw and put something in between his teeth and the piece of muscle.

(I will probably post this on more platforms such as 4chan)\n\nHere is my comment, take it as you please.\n\n\nSome of y'all motherlovers think Jeff the killer is shit, not in my eyes.\nThe OG Jeff the killer is perfectly fine as it is, y'all are just a bunch of judgemental perfectionist, even if it is terrible and badly written (which it's not) IT'S STILL a story written by a writer that just want to get a story and origin out there. And the deletion of the OG story was not deserved, and to the moderators that deleted the OG story, I wish you the worst and most painful life possible. If you're the admin that have deleted the original JTK I really hate you, I hope you have a manipulative and abusive girlfriend, I hope you lose everything, I wish you all of hell. But anyway, the whole point of creepypastas is anyone can write and make them, just because Jeff the killer (the original) didn't have William Shakespeare levels of writing does not mean it's bad and it deserves to be deleted and banished from the internet. \n\n\n\nJeff the killer (the original) it has a lot of undeserved and unneeded hate, the people who hates on Jeff the killer and calls it cringe or a power fantasy or whatever the hell are a bunch of perfectionist that's thinks every story must be perfectly written.\n\nLeave my boy Jeff alone, he doesn't deserve the hate \n\nAs a weird, violent and mysterious teenager, Jeff (og version) holds a special place in my heart (I'm not gay)\n\nI think the original JTK is very good and should be or is the definitive and prime version of Jeff the killer. \n\n\nTo all the people who hate on the original and the moderators who deleted it, \n\nI hate you, I hate you all. \n\nThat's all I got to say, hopefully my comment doesn't get deleted or YouTube doesn't decide to take away my comment privileges away again.\n\n"},"781":{"title":"Murder\/Mr.Morgan ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f25o12\/murdermrmorgan\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"nabletobeme","selftext":"Night 2: in the early minutes of the eleventh hour I awoke with a calmness unlike the previous days. The door chain was unlatched and the door was uncharacteristically unlocked as well. The motel key was placed on the night stand and my watch was still around my wrist. the initial confusion I felt when I awoke began to subside as the moments gathered. And I began scrambling through my bag to check if anything was missing. And as I stated my notebook was nowhere to be found. \n\nI don’t quite remember how I got back to the motel or even where I ended up on my investigation. All I know is that something didn’t feel right. I felt cemented in place as a quaint knock began to sound from the window, a light wrapping at first and then louder and more intense it grew. Panic once again ensued. So I raced to the door to lock and latch it shut when the door bursted open. \n\nA voice called out “Mr.Morgan, what’s this about? its Sheriff Marley.” \n\nI was too frightened to speak yet, he said \n“My god kid, I could have you arrested for assaulting an officer!” \n\nIncreasingly more irritated with each sentence, he stated“You just about took my head clean off my shoulders trying to slam that door on me!” \n\nEmbarrassed I responded “I’m sorry about that sheriff, just kind of having a weird night…”   \n\nhis eyes softened and he calmly spoke “ forget about it, you’re forgiven.” \n\nFollowed by “ so what’s gotten you all shaken up Milo?” \n\nI began my explanation “ well Sheriff, first off I can’t even remember what I was doing today.

This cycle had been ongoing for about a week..or two…and honestly, made time seem even more warped. \n\nMy mind berated me: Was I doing enough? Should I be burning through my very-nearly nonexistent savings like this? I shouldn’t be picky, I should just go get whatever job I can…beggars can’t be choosers y’know…\n\nAttempting to shake off the mental fog, I got up quickly from the couch, walked over the mini fridge against the adjacent wall and took out an ice-cold soda. Placing the cold can against my head I sighed, having momentary relief and trying to reassure myself that I was making the right decision. I deserve the RIGHT job. I have the experience. I have the skill set. I shouldn’t settle. One of these opportunities will pan out…I know it.\n\nFeeling a renewed sense of vigor, I turned to my phone, charging on the table that sat beside the couch. I nabbed it up and looked as the screen to see the time, 4:37pm, and nothing else but my screen saver - some generic mountain range captured at dusk that always made me feel nostalgic for a place I’d never been. \n\nI let out another sigh, glanced around my sparse and warm living quarters and thought about how to kill the rest of the day. \n\nThat’s when I heard it. Outside my apartment window. A lady’s voice, fairly young. Exuberant. Happy. But…slightly wrong. \n\nShe spoke, “I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” \n\nIt sounded like she was talking to kid, maybe an even a baby. I was half tempted to pull back the curtain and scan the lawn to see, but I thought, if she was there and some weird dude starts staring at her…well, that’d be awkward. \n\nI’m not overly familiar with my neighbors in the apartments across the way. But I’d never seen a kid or baby, and I’d never heard a voice like this before. \n\nTo a normal person, you’d think “why is a lady talking to a baby weird?” - and you know, I’d agree with you. But, I’d spent too much time indoors with naught but my own mind to keep me company. And I’m sure you can guess that leads to heightened anxiety.\n\n“Christopher, get a-fuckin-hold of yourself dude” - “you’ve spent too many days sitting in this apartment moping around that now some lady talking to a baby has you freaked out” - \n\nI let out a chuckle at myself for being so stupid. \n\nWhat a dumbass…\n\nI cracked the soda open and took big gulp, letting the carbonation and sugar simultaneously burn and soothe my throat. \n\nI let a hearty and likely-annoying “AHHHHH” afterwards, and to my own amusement.\n\nI finished the soda in another two gulps, walked over the trash can situated near the sink and chucked it in. \n\nWalking back into the living room, I noticed there was no longer any game of peek-a-boo being cooed outside my window and all had returned to its normal and uninteresting silence. \n\nWith this, I turned my attention back to the phone, deciding I would manually check my emails. Sometimes notifications don’t always works as intended and I was desperate for some sign of forward momentum.\n\nAs I placed my finger over the “email” icon on my home screen the exuberant, joyful and even more warped voice rang out again.\n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” \n\nThis time it wasn’t coming from behind me, beyond the curtained window. It was coming from my porch; right behind my front door.\n\nI stared in confusion in its direction. \n\n“What in fuck” - I could feel anxiety anxious energy surge through my body. My mind wasn’t sure how to process the voice or what was happening -\n\nWhy is the voice at my door? Why does it sound like that? \n\nI tried to quickly rationalize it; uh…maybe she’s waiting for her friend across the way, the uh…Carrollwoods I think? Maybe she’s friends or family, and it’s hot and she’s got her baby and is trying to keep him calm or entertained? \n\nMy brain was rooting around trying to red-yarn its way to some conclusion that made that voice - that was now just passed my front door - less out of place; less…strange.\n\n“Get your act together..” \n\nThen it hit me. \n\nI’m dramatizing a situation because I’m bored and not being productive. \n\nOf course.\n\nDuh.\n\nI chuckled again at my own stupidity.\n\nI’m going to go to my room and watch TV. \nThe fan blows better in there anyways; and I’ll be away from this lady’s annoying blabbering. I’m not scared, I’m just annoyed. \n\nI lied to make myself feel less like a wuss who was evading a strange scenario, and more like someone who was choosing to avoid an obnoxious situation.\n\nI sat up and quickly walked down the hall. The lady’s discordant, joyful and robotic “I see you!” fading.\n\nUpon entering my modest room - which housed a bed, a sofa chair, a small closest and smaller bathroom, I shut the door and, out some animal-borne sense of security - locked it.\n\nI plopped down in the sofa chair and quickly booted up my TV and launched Netflix. \n\nI was paranoid about nothing. I knew that. But, stranger things have happened, and I wasn’t going to assume I was safe. \n\nDespite not being able to hear the lady any longer, I cranked the volume over my usual listening threshold. I sat back and began to watch a documentary on Panda preservation.\n\nBefore I knew it my eyes had grown heavy and my body and mind had given themselves over to sleep yet again. \n\nSome time later I jolted awake. the room dark and TV off due to its power-save settings. \n\nWhat had woken me was the soft pulsating of the phone in my hand vibrating.\n\nThe caller-ID read “Mom”.\n\nI stared at it - half out of grogginess and half out of cowardice. “Do I want to talk to her?” or, as it usually goes with my mother, “be talked at” by her.\n\nI decided against answering. I was already feeling annoyed at myself enough, I didn’t need a good ol’ dogpiling from my mother to top it off.\n\nPlus, I had to pee. God did I have to pee.\n\nI got up, and hustled the few short steps into the connected bathroom. Flicked on the light, and as I was about unbuckle my pants, from past the door to my bedroom came THAT voice. The lady’s voice. Joyful, sweet, energetic. LOUD. And very very WRONG. \n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!”\n\nThere was no denying it now. This voice sounded human, but it wasn’t. It was slightly warped. As if the edges of it were bending, warping. As if the mouth forming them was too misshapen to form them right; as if the voice projecting them was doing its best to mock it. \n\nMy mind raced; this seemed unbelievable. What in absolute fuck was less than 3 feet away, inside my apartment, WHY was it doing this to me?\n\nI blinked hard and gathered what little resolve I had - it didn’t matter what or why this was happening. It just was. And I could safely conclude that, whatever it was, it was intending to scare or - worse - hurt me.\n\nI had my phone. I could call 9-1-1. That was step one. \n\nStep two, I had a baseball bat in my closet. I could grab that and ready myself. \n\nStep three, I had small window that dropped down into the courtyard. I was on the second floor, but I could manage the jump. I think.\n\nThat’s all I could think to do.\n\nWith all the bluster and bravado I could muster, I quickly moved to the sofa chair, grabbed my phone and made to my open closest grabbing the bat, all in a few swift movements. All the while the “Lady” was cooing the same phrase over and over again, on a loop, not more than 5 feet away.\n\nI wrestled with the lock on my bedroom window. It wasn’t playing nice. I don’t think I’d ever opened it in the 4 years I’d lived here and it obviously hadn’t been opened long before then. \n\nAfter struggling with the latch for what felt like an eternity, it gave way and I then proceeded to press up on the window. Luckily it went flying up without much resistance, and as I pushed it up it made a hard slamming sound.\n\nAnd as if on cue, when that happened, the “Lady” outside the door chanting stopped on a dime.\n\nIt was dead silent. The only discernible sound was my breathing, the night air flowing in and bringing with it the sounds crickets and cicadas.\n\nI sat by the open window, wide-eyed. Staring directly into the dinky lit room and laser-focused on the bedroom door.\n\nFrom underneath the door frame an impossibly long arm silently began to stretch up. Skin pale, almost blue in the light. Vascular. The fingers, long, boney and dressed in rings against their bulging knuckles. The fingernails longer still and adorned in a crimson polish that almost seemed to glow in the drearily lit bedroom.\n\nThe impossibly long arm effortlessly stretched until its index finger effortlessly touched the lock on the doorknob. And as if waiting just a beat to heighten the tension, it clicked the lock.\n\nThe door was now unlocked. This…”Lady” could swing the door open…and whatever it was could cross the threshold into the room and come for me.\n\nI had to jump. The risk of breaking my legs be damned, I didn’t want to see what ghoulish visage that arm belonged too. \n\nI steeled my nerves and jumped the twelve or so feet to grass courtyard below. \n\nI landed with a hard thud, but not didn’t lose my balance.\n\nMy adrenaline rushing, I made a hasty dash toward the center of my small complex. My legs firing like pistons, I gunned it to nearest light source, which happened to be a small gazebo. \n\nThen my flight or fight response loosened enough for me to think: “I gotta call the fuckin’ cops!”\n\nAs I approached the small structure, which was bathed in a harsh and singular white light, I pivoted to look back at my apartment window. No hand. No creature. No…nothing. Just an open window.\n\nBut what would I expect to see? Some ghoulish haunt leering out at me from that darkened opening? Some unholy visage, all teeth and elongated appendages coaxing me back in? What was going on with me? Was I having some sort…breakdown? Had the stress and loneliness gotten to me? That was certainly a better explanation than what I was THINKING was happening…right?\n\nI sighed, plopped down hard on the only bench housed under the gazebo and unlocked my phone.\n\nI had a notification.\n\nAn email.\n\nI knew, no matter, now wasn’t the time. I needed to call the cops. I needed to make sure my apartment was clear and if I was having a mental breakdown, I could get help. I needed this…whatever the fuck it was…to be over. \n\nBut, you know that often unseen hand the guides us to make the most inane decisions at just the wrong moment? Yeah. That ONE. That force propelled me to click on the email notification.\n\nGod dammit, I wish I hadn’t.\n\nIt took me to a video. \n\nThe video was dark, quiet. As if nothing was even playing…but then a loud static and the sound of hands fumbling around as the frame was jilted and shook.\n\nAnd then, as if lit with a small and barely effectual flashlight, a mouth plastered with a wry grin appeared. But, as with the voice, it was wrong. It was too wide, with far too many small teeth. the lips were thin and smeared with crimson lipstick, the same shade as fingernails I’d seen just minutes ago.\n\nThen it began to move; to talk. \n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you!”\n\nI felt my body flush with fear; confusion; anger. WHAT. THE. FUCK. WAS. HAPPENING?!\n\nI tried to exit out, I tried shutting my phones power off. Nothing was working.\n\nI instinctively, and forcefully, dropped my phone. the mantra was on a disturbing repeat. The “Lady’s” joyous and warped voice a disgusting lullaby I HAD to get away from.\n\nWhatever ungodly force had decided to visit me was breaking the bounds of any reality I understood. \n\n“Neighbors!” - my mind yelled at me. “ GO to the Carrolwood’s…ask to use their phone…call 9-1-1. Figure this shit out. GO!” \n\nI spurred myself into action, running out from beneath the gazebo and toward the other two story apartment complex that directly faced mine.\n\nNavigating the dimly lit walkway up to their door, I didn’t have concern for etiquette or what time it was; I was in pure self-preservation mode.\n\nI knocked on their door as loudly I could.\n\n“Fuck…what’s the wife’s name? Denise? Desiree? Ahhh. Something with a D…” \n\nI simultaneously scolded myself whilst trying to recall the woman’s name. Her husband, who I had only met once in passing, was a complete unknown.\n\nBefore I could deliberate any further, a porch light popped on and a voice from behind the door wavered out at me.\n\nIt was a man - the aforementioned husband.\n\n“Who…what the hell do you want?”\n\n“I am so sorry to bother you Mr. Carrollwood…But someone broke into my house and I don’t have my cell and I’m worried and I need to call the cops.. I live across the way in unit 17 -“\n\nHe cut me off.\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Christian, right?” He said, his tone less unsure and worried and now more curious and annoyed.\n\n“Christopher.” I responded back hurriedly while throwing another glance at my apartment unit.\n\nAnother voice, quieter, came out from behind the door. A woman. \n\n“Christopher, honey, yes? You sound scared. Let’s get you some help”\n\nThank god. Buddha. Shiva. Elvis. Who-the-fuck-ever!\n\nI sighed. I felt a wave of uncertain hope wash over me. \n\nThe door unlatched and swung open to reveal a dark opening. \n\nOne that seemed stretch in a void….\n\nThere was no one there. \n\nNo Mr. Carrollwood.\n\nNo Ms. Carrollwood.\n\nJust a dark hallway and a voice that loudly reached from just beyond its bounds.\n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you…CHRISTOPHER”\n\nAs quickly as I had felt hope, I felt my body give itself over to absolute terror.\n\nI spun around and attempted to run, but that long, pale-blue arm. The one with its nail’s adorned in a bright, glowing crimson polish had wrapped its unnatural fingers all the way around my calf.\n\nI fell hard on the “We’re Glad You’re Here!” Welcome mat that decorated the front porch of the Carrollwood’s.\n\nI managed to turn my body around to see that the arm was pulling me into the void. I couldn’t see the creature it was attached too, and I didn’t want too. I need to fight. I get loose.\n\nBut I was being dragged by a force so strong, any attempt I made to swing my bat or kick was met with pure indifference.\n\n“Holy shit! This is it” my mind raced. My heart thrashed inside my chest so hard, I felt like I’d have a heart attack, or worse, die of fear.\n\nI swung the bat. I yelled. I cursed.\n\nIt was no use. I was being drawn into the maw of this entity, this being. This…THING.  \n\nI had shut my eyes and waited. Waited to die. \n\nI stopped moving. \n\nI didn’t feel the hand upon my leg anymore. \n\nI felt warm. \n\nI jolted awake. \n\nI was in my apartment. The sticky-heaviness of the room just as it had been hours before.\n\nThe golden light from the afternoon poured in through what cracks it could.\n\n“What the fuck” I thought. “Did…I just dream that shit?”\n\nAs I straightened my stiff and slightly achey body up - and coming to grips with absolute deja vu - a voice rang out from down the hall. This time, slow; loud; and just passed the threshold of my sight.\n\n“PEEK-A-BOO….I. SEE. YOU.”\n"},"784":{"title":"I murdered the guy because he called me an American ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f2ajfs\/i_murdered_the_guy_because_he_called_me_an\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I looked at the man with intent to kill because he said that I am an American.

That was a low blow and he knows how much I don't like America. There are reasons as to why I don't like America. \n\nMy whole family had tried immigrating to America and the things they had done to try to immigrate to america, they did horrible things. They murdered and attacked their own family members to try and get to America. Only to fail or die in America. So no i don't have a good point of view of America and when someone says that I look like an American, it brings up those memories. This guy kept saying that I am and American and I kept telling him to shut up. He wouldn't let it go. I mean I was bigger than this guy and yet he was still picking on me.\n\nHe kept calling me and American and I then grabbed him and stabbed him all over the place. As I stabbed him I had flash backs of the past of my relatives stabbing other people to steal their tickets to go to America. I had flash backs of my cousins dying in America as a homeless person when they shouldn't have been inside america. Then as I stopped stabbing this guy, all of the holes I had made on his body started speaking. Now I had multiple mouths telling me that I am an American. \n\nWhenever they called me American it's like I had killed my family. I went outside but the guy I stabbed kept following me while heavily bleeding. He kept calling me an American and the stab holes on his body also kept calling me an American. I had a large knife in my hand which I took from restaurant, they had it hung on the wall as part of it's decoration. I decapitated that man, but his head and the stab holes on his body kept calling me and American. \n\nI just kind of gave up and sat on the floor and then the police caught me. I kept telling them how I will never be American and that's all I kept saying to them, i told them they could do whatever they want but just don't call me american.

Despite the lack of physical energy my mental desire to pursue any and all possible leads was inflamed. I got changed and packed my bag with my pens and a pad, a survival knife, a lock pick set(just in case) a bolt cutter and a charger. Again just in case. I hopped in the car and instead of starting close to”home” I decided to gps the furthest destination to start and work my way back. John And Mary’s house just so happened to be the furthest. \n\nResidential reconnaissance: \nThe drive was only a few miles out towards the outskirts of town, I wasn’t sure I was at the right address, this wasn’t at all what I was expecting. \n\nThe house was almost dilapidated, the roof the sunken in the wooden panels broken in some places and the paint was peeling or chipped basically everywhere else. The smell of a marsh was emanating from the front porch which was comprised of broken and rotted boards which barely seemed to support my weight. With each uneasy step I came around to the door which was sealed shut with a chain and padlock. And a big sign on the front door read \n\n“CONDEMNED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT” \n\nI dropped my bag and pulled out my old Bolt cutters and slid them right in between a link of chain and then squeezed my arms together with all the force in me hearing the link snap was satisfying as the chain dropped to the ground the hollowness of the porch beneath my feet was emphasized dramatically. \n\nI twisted the handle and opened what had to be a record set for creakiest door of all time and the marshy aroma struck my nose like Mike Tyson. Pungent and intense. If you’ve ever smelt an amphibious enclosure multiple that smell by 100 and that’s how bad it was. And upon crossing the threshold I found out why inside you could hear a constant stream of water from somewhere in the house and insects chirping throughout. The floor was paved with moss, mushrooms and overgrown weeds the walls were shrouded in vines and when you looked up there was a hole in the ceiling that let a little light trickle down. Nature had taken over almost entirely. But not calmly by any means. \n\nThe stairs leading upstairs were caved in. And the subfloor was scattered with soft points “condemned for good reason” I thought. I examined the surrounding areas as best I could fearing one mis-step would cause a total collapse. \n\nThe living room still had furniture and a tv but again it was consumed by the elements. The kitchen was littered with utensils and pans that somehow escaped the wrath of Mother Nature. The dining room still had two plates set out on the table. Leaving me baffled more than anything else. Almost as if the night of the murder had been preserved waiting for someone to discover that the files told a different story than what actually transpired. \n\nJust as I was about to leave the floorboards above my head started squeaking followed by heavy footsteps. My head started spinning and I froze the pacing picked up of the steps as I crept back towards the front door I looked back towards the stairwell and saw a figure half peaking out of the doorway above… in full panic mode my legs broke free from their paralyzed state and forced me into full sprint out the door as the figure scuttled from the doorway to the top of the stairs in position to leap to the first floor. I raced to my car and immediately started the engine. Shifted into gear and drove off….\n\n“What the fuck was that!?” I screamed, as a familiar cold sweat washed over me. \n\n\n\n……you know something doesn’t sit right. \n\nI swear I heard my name as I was running away.

Have you heard of these creatures?\n\nUncle Jack regretted telling Susie about the deer he saw by the dip in the highway, because she hadn’t let up ever since. “When will you take me to the deer, Uncle jack?” “Are you driving down by that highway soon?”\n\nThe kid was really into animals and wildlife and shit, and eventually he agreed to take her- he drove by that stretch several times a week anyway, and it was barely twenty minutes to pick her up from his sister’s place, drive by the deer, and take her back home. She had always been his favourite niece, bubbly and wanting to tell him about this and that, and god knows she’d had it rough these past months, always in lock down and not being able to run out and about like kids ought.\n\nMaybe that was why she was so excited. Riding a truck with her favourite uncle at midnight was exciting enough, add to that seeing deer in the wild was enough to set her in a tizzy. She couldn’t stop chatting in the truck, and she had cut up a whole bagful of apples to feed them.\n\n“Honey you don’t want to get to close to them, you ain’t planning on feeding them by hand, are you?” Her excitement made him a bit anxious, and he wondered if he should have insisted for his sister to join them, to keep her in check.\n\nShe squealed. “Oh! Look! Stop! Please Uncle Jack! Oh wow look at them they’re magnificent!”\n\nUncle Jack pulled in. There was enough light to see the beasts quite clearly, despite the dark.  There were at least three of them, quite close, and he spotted other moving shadows among the trees. Susie had her phone out and was busy taking photos.\n\n“This is no good, I have to get closer!” Before he could say anything, she had opened the truck door and jumped out.\n\n“Now there Susie” he muttered, getting out and circling the truck to get to her.\n\nSusie was already much closer to the deer than he had anticipated. He could hear the rapid click of the camera as she stepped closer to the deer. The moving shadows morphed into more deer, also moving towards her quite rapidly, and soon there was barely five feet between the girl and what looked like a whole gang of deer, their eyes glinting.\n\n“Susie!” yelled Jack. She paid him no mind, tugging on the apple bag.\n\nHe knew he had to get to her but he felt rooted to the spot. Even when the deer butted her to the ground and she began screaming, he felt paralysed. The apples fell to the ground, unnoticed.\n\nToo quickly, the screaming stopped. Some deer looked up, straight at him, while others were still bent down over Susie. They began coming towards him. In the glaring lights of a passing car, he saw clearly blood around their mouths.\n\nHe ran to the truck, threw himself in and drove off.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nAnd now he drowns his sorrows at my bar, every night.

When I fuze two objects together by marrying them, they truly do stuck together. How marry objects off is by me basically saying that two certain objects are married. I basically say \"in the name of God I marry these two objects together\" and they become stuck to one and another. Majority of the times the objects that get married together stay stuck together for a life time. I love it that I have figured it out but not everyone likes to marry off objects. They prefer to fuze together objects through the normal way. \n\nAny how just like all marriages, marriages can have problems. So when I fuze together two objects through use of marriage, small percentages of marriages can have problems, and the two objects aren't properly fuzed together if there marriage has problems. Like when I fuzed together two metal rods through marriage, the two rods had problems in there marriage. So the two rods kept falling apart and I couldn't fuzed them back together. I tried marrying off 3 objects together in one marriage, and that always fails. In the world of objects, having 3 in a marriage is destined to fail. \n\nSo I decided to build a house by marrying the bricks at a time, but i made one fatal flaw. I intended to marry 2 bricks at a time and when I was laying down 2 married bricks at a time, I had to marry two married bricks with other married bricks, and the math was all over the place. I thought I had the house well built until I started seeing cracks in the bricks and parts of the walls were wobbling. I tried giving counselling to the married bricks but I had essentially married thousands of bricks into one marriage. \n\nThat wasn't the main worry for me and a guy I had abducted and put into my cellar, I made his arm marry a wall in the ceiling. So there was no need go tie him up. Then because the marriage was really bad between the wall in the ceiling and the guys arm, the guy was able to break away and escape. I was terrified and I couldn't find him anymore. Then I could hear the whole house wobbling and making a noise. \n\nI ran outside and 10 minutes later the whole house had collapsed. So the guy i had abducted had escaped and my house had collapsed. It's gonna be a long week."},"797":{"title":"Cooking meat with bibles ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f1hsv9\/cooking_meat_with_bibles\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I was invited to a barbecue by our neighbours and I am new to the area. I have bought a house all by myself and life is going really good right now. I have got a great job and an amazing salary, and I live alone. It's a great neighbourhood and everyone is so nice. I really can't complain and sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure that I am not dreaming. I just can't believe how great my life is right now and I remember how hard life use to be. I guess I am experiencing survivor guilt because I still know people who are really badly struggling. \n\nAnyhow I was invited to a barbecue by this really nice couple and they have a large house in the area. Their house was extremely nice and when I went in I was impressed by the decor. There were other guests in the garden and when went into the garden, I introduced myself to the other guests. After some chit chats with the other guests, I then noticed something under the barbecue. It's what they are going to use to cook the meat. They are not using coal or any kind of cooking oil, they are using bibles. \n\nNot just bibles but other objects that relate to the Abraham's religions. They are also using the quran and the Torah to cook the meats. They are not going to burn the holy books, but they simply put the meat onto the holy books and the meat started cooking itself. Started roasting and this was against all logic, because how can these holy books and Abrahamic objects be able to cook the meat when no fire is involved. Everyone else was just talking casually and I was just staring at this impossibility. \n\nThe holy books were simply the holy books and the meat just looked like any other meat. I had to know how the meat was being cooked without ever using fire. I went to the couple who invited everyone to thier house hold. I couldn't help it and they weren't rude about it as well when I asked them. They took me to a large closed off closet and they had all sorts of things tied up in there. The things they had tied up in there was a vampire and a man who was possessed by a demon. \n\nWhen the cut off pieces of meat from the vampire, the vampires limbs grew back. The meat that we had from the vampire would start roasting when it went near any relic of any Abrahamic religions. \n\nThe demon possessed can't regrow its limbs but the demon is keeping him alive. I slowly got out of there and I couldn't believe I ate vampire and demon meat, cooked on literal bibles from every Abrahamic religion.

However, one thing is for sure, no matter what the reason was, something sinister had targeted me during the summer of 2006.\n\nIt all began during one of those nights, when my nine-year-old self preferred playing with a game handheld with low volume instead of sleeping. At some point around two in the morning, my ordeal started out of the blue. I heard the door slowly open and quickly hid the console under my pillow, which literally muted the device as I faked being asleep. With care, I then opened one eye just enough, expecting to see my mother, the single parent of the house, checking on me to ensure I was asleep but instead, the door just remained partially open. I waited for at least four minutes which felt like forever, thinking she already saw what she needed to while my eyes were closed, and hoping to see her close the door. When I was fed up with waiting, I decided to get out of bed and close the door silently. However, the moment I approached, the door was violently slammed shut.\n\nLater in the morning, by mere fear of snitching on myself, I avoided mentioning any of it to my mother, expecting she would then assume that I was awake the whole time. I went about my day, doing what kids do and during the night, I was back to business with the game handheld. Once again, around two in the morning, the door slowly opened. 'Well Josh, you know the routine!' I thought, confident and executing the usual choreography to deceive my mother. Once again, I opened one eye and the door was partially open with no other particular activity. Annoyed, because I did not want to walk to the door like the night before, I called:\n\n\"Mommy?\" Faking a sleepy and tired voice to the best of my ability but got no response the first time. \"Mom?\" I insisted more convincingly after a few seconds. The non-verbal response I obtained, covered me with shivers.\n\nFour fingers, white like snow, appeared as an unknown hand gripped the top of the door, the way a person would do to hold it open. They were almost glowing in the dark, almost fluorescent. Was it a glove? No, because I could glimpse the dark color of the nails contrasting with the fingers. They remained there, no movement, nobody taking a look or fully coming in the room.\n\n\"Mom is that—you?\" I asked, hesitantly. How could it be her? I knew for a fact that my mom had a personal reason for never painting her nails, so they were never that dark. I called again, worried at this point, and in response, a second set of four similar fingers appeared at the very bottom of the door, as the intruder unnaturally gripped the door with his other hand, I assumed. I began hyperventilating, mustering the strength to scream for my mother at this point, but when I tried, only a whimper came out of my mouth instead. In response, a third set of four similar fingers appeared in the middle of the door near the handle,\n\n\"Mommy?\" I heard multiple people say at the same time, at least, this is how I can describe what I heard. It was as if they miserably tried to imitate me, frightening me instead.\n\nI just screamed.\n\nThe three hands quickly retreated behind the door which was then violently slammed shut by the intruders. A few seconds later, my mother stormed inside the room. She just reassured me that it was nothing and opted for me to sleep besides her in the main bedroom. Nothing else happened that night, and having my mother with me meant no more furtive nocturnal gaming but at least, 100% safety. How wrong I was.\n\nAbout two days later, I was peacefully sleeping one night, with my back glued to my mother's chest and belly, when I was suddenly awakened by a strange noise. I opened my eyes and immediately looked at the door from where I was, without moving an inch, and witnessed a vision of horror. The fingers were there, the hands were back, but that time, there were around ten hands, and thus countless fingers tapping on the door with the tips of their nails, the way some people casually do on a table when they wait for something.\n\n\"Mooom.\" I whispered, trying to notify her without alerting the intruders. \"Mooooom wake up.\" I insisted, discreetly tapping her thigh with my hand.\n\nHer response froze my whole being:\n\n\"Ssssh! Just ignore it Josh, sleep.\" She said, before placing her arm over my body to reassure me.\n\nInstead, what I saw mortified me to the point that I could no longer make any sound:\n\nThe arm that covered me was as white as snow, with dark nails at the end of each of its fingers.\n\nParalyzed with terror, I remained still, trembling to the core and letting tears of fear just streaming from my eyes. I remained there, the whole night, and to this day, I do not know how I fell asleep, but I did. The next morning, I woke up to my mom getting ready for work as if nothing strange happened.\n\nWas it really my mom? Was my own mother part of the intruders? I guess we will never know. We did not talk about it at the time and never did since. I requested to go back to my room the same day and opted for barricading my door every night. To this day, I still do so, no matter what building or room I spend the night into, and nobody understands why. I know that I have to. Why? Because every night, I can still hear the faint tapping of multiple fingers on the door. Sometimes, they even knock, but never say anything other than that distorted 'mommy' for whatever reason. I just know that I should never come face to face with the sinister people behind the door."},"801":{"title":"Can anyone please help me find an old video I watched years ago of a female narrating the blue button eye teddy bear?

If we didn't pick up the dead bodies then we would float away into space.

We all woke up one morning floating onto our ceilings and there were loads of dead bodies around, that were not floating. So we knew we had to hold onto them to not float away. Why gravity turned into dead bodies? I have no idea. \n\nThen as the dead bodies that were once gravity, had started to turn to dust, people started to float away again. These dead bodies had a time limit, but some guy found out that if he killed someone then that new dead body will be gravity, and it will stop him from floating away. It was only dead bodies that could help us not to float away. Then as the dead body that I was carrying started to eradicate, I started to feel lighter and I was floating. Then I quickly shot a large guy and I held onto him. \n\nThat large guy I shot, he was also holding a dead body to keep from floating away. So I had two dead bodies on top of me, and that was stopping me from floating away. As I laid on the ground rather grateful that I wasn't floating away, and I could see some people whose dead bodies had eradicated and were now floating away in space. Thier screams went more silent the more they went up in the skies. I wondered how and why gravity turned into dead bodies? And even though I couldn't move as I had two dead bodies on top of my, I started thinking about my life. \n\nI remembered a time when I worked in the uncaring business. I hated it because I always cared. You should never care when you are in the uncaring business. Every day I had to torture people and do all sorts of things to them. I couldn't stop myself from hurting them and when I would try to stop, a demon would shout at me to keep torturing them. Then I realised that I was in hell and that the uncaring business was definitely a part of hell. \n\nThen I was saved from drowning.

So this graveyard is so old and its known for the creepy things that happens there.\n\nAnyways I go to a gym thats far away from my place because I go with my friends, the gym is around 8kms from my place, but as a sport I go there with my bike, but the shortest way to go to the gym is by going through the graveyard, but for me as a person that goes to the same gym every day its a normal route for me\n\n but the problem is that I go to the gym at around 4am, but I put my headphones and put music so It gets less creepy in the way through the graveyard, but today I was cycling through the graveyard and some dust from the air came in my mouth, so I spat the dust out of my mouth, and that was the biggest mistake,\n\n suddenly after I spat, the music stopped and some creepy static started playing, and I heard someone say an Arabic a word that means run! I took my headphones off and threw them, and it was so dark that I couldn't see anything, and my bikes light stopped working, I ran as fast as I can but suddenly I saw something that appeared in front of me, it looked like a human but it was a white translucent body, and my mind was still trying to process what I saw when I felt something pulling me off the bike. I fell from the bike, and I was out for about two hours when an old man came and waked me up and helped me and he found my bike and my backpack, he asked me what happened\n\n I told him everything but he didn't look surprised.

Like whenever there is a leak on my ceiling, it will always be the neighbour who lives above me or the building pipe line at fault. It's great being on the ground floor and okay the view outside isn't great but at least I won't be at fault for anything. Also I won't be in trouble for causing noise and so having a flat at the ground level is pretty practical. It's easier to move stuff in and out and it's all good. \n\nThen one day I get an email from the block management that looks after the building, the email read that I had to check my pipes because it might be leaking at the flat below me. I was shocked and the email also said how I am causing lots of noise for the flat below, and I then returned an email by typing 'my flat is at the ground floor. There is no apartment below me....' and of course block management always being too slow to respond, I wait hesitantly. \n\nI get another email from block management about how I am causing too much noise and that my flat is leaking below onto another flat. I then get onto the phone and I speak with them. I tell them that my flat is on ground floor and so how can I be leaking onto anyone. The guy on the other end of the phone sounds confused. These office types all they do is stay at the office and hardly ever come out to check what's going on with the flats. So the whole matter was just rubbed under the carpet. \n\nThe email that sent them a complaint about me causing a noise and having a leaky pipe, isn't an email belong to anyone who is living in these apartments. So it's all so confusing. Then when day around midnight, I get a knock on the door. This knock had an echo to it and through the door I could hear a ghastly voice saying \"your apartment is leaking\" and when I opened the door, no one was there. I was really spooked and the hallway lights were flickering. Then I would get more knocks during the night and through the door I would hear \"you are causing too much noise\" \n\nThen as I open the door no one was there. It was all too strange and then one day someone was actually inside my flat and this guy shouted out loud \"your flat is leaking onto my flat and you are causing too much noise\" and then he disappeared. \n\nI have had to resort to living in flats for a while.

Some historians report the existence of this being since the 1800's, while others say it even dates back to the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn reality, no one knows for sure if this being actually exists or not, there are many theories about the large number of children and young people who mysteriously disappeared around the world. However, there are common factors in all of them, without exception.\n\nTheir relatives, friends and close friends in general reported that these same people, months or even days before their disappearance, were going through very difficult times, even reaching a state of depression or being on the verge of suicide. Family problems, economic problems, bullying, absent parents, loneliness... Especially loneliness.\n\nTheir parents, siblings and even neighbors said that at night they heard them talking to themselves... Something about ending all their problems and worries, about a supposed \"rebirth\", a new life. No one knew for sure what exactly they were talking about, because when they entered the room to find out if they were really talking to someone, nothing. They were back alone.\n\nHowever, there were always small red stains on the bedroom window. Blood from one of the previous missing persons in that area.\n\n\n\nIf any adult saw whatever was with the child, it was disappeared that same night or the next, but without leaving any trace.\n\n\n\nThis could sometimes happen for days, weeks or months. However, the result was always the same no matter how long it lasted: \"Young man XXXXXX XXXXXXXX has been reported missing,\" and, within a few days, traces of his blood would appear on some other window in that area.\n\nWithin all this, there was something peculiar... Children always gave in much faster than teenagers.\n\n\n\nThere has been much speculation about what can happen to these young people. Some people believe they are kidnappers and serial killers, others believe that they are the same demons who come from the depths to take young people prone to sin and turn them into their lackeys. Meanwhile, I have my own theory...\n\n\n\nA year and seven months ago, the nephew of a friend of mine from college suffered one of these sudden disappearances, being only 9 years old, and his brother, Lucas, was also taken in the process.\n\nThe day after he managed to see the being that was with his son, he was almost delirious, saying that a monster was trying to convince his son to join him in a new immortal life, promising him that all his problems would be solved and he wouldn't have to worry about anything, not even think about why someone else would do it for him, but that the only condition was to give up his humanity. He managed to obtain all this information by hitting and screaming at his son to get him to tell him what was happening.\n\nHe also gave my friend a description of what this creature was like. He said it was like a human body but cut in half and dripping blood from the torso. His upper body was like he was wearing a blue jacket, but with sharp black claws instead of hands that were intertwined with the jacket, that is, that was part of his body. He had no face, the only thing that was noticeable where the face should be were bright white eyes and an equally macabre smile. The curious thing is that, despite being stained with blood, he never left a trace.\n\nThat same night, despite trying to go to another state or even leave the country if possible, both Lucas and his son disappeared without a trace.\n\n\n\nMy theory is that it is a perverse being that has been around since the beginning of humanity as a dominant species, that takes advantage of children and young people with emotional problems in their environment and convinces them to become one of them, no matter how long it takes, and that acts as a kind of hive mind spread throughout the planet. That is why no matter how far away you go, if you saw this being, you are doomed.\n\nBut, here the question arises, why do they do this? Probably to feed on the lower part of the body of its victims and take advantage of the agony of the upper part to create a new being like them, as full of evil as its suffering and desire for revenge.\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\nKnowing so much about this entity, it seems strange to me that, even after so much time, it has not decided to come for me. It is possible that it does not know that I know of its existence, but, by making this document public, I will have signed my death sentence. However, I cannot let this stay like this, the world must know the truth.\n\nAfter all, they must stop believing that their children are talking to \"their imaginary friend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd remember, young reader, the importance of taking care of mental health, because these beings can appear to you even in the most insignificant low mood, leading to an escalation to a much worse situation, which they will take advantage of to convince you to join them. However, whatever you do, do not accept anything they say, ignore them and make sure no one else sees it... You do not want to be a loose end in this thing."},"814":{"title":"La cartuccia dei morti","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f0h1sh\/la_cartuccia_dei_morti\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"andrystein03","selftext":"Era una tranquilla giornata di (for)Maggio. il sole splendeva, gli uccellini cinguettavano, i fiori sbocciavano e io me ne stavo chiuso in casa a guardare il mio amatissimo Barbero, ero arrivato alla mia parte preferita: dove ci sono i cittadini grossi, quando mi chiamò un mio amico, diceva di aver trovato a buon prezzo, 5 euro, una vecchia cartuccia pokémon per gameboy advance.  \nMi disse:\"è davvero strana, non ho mai visto una cartuccia così. Perché non ci giochiamo insieme?\"  \nRisposi:\"Perché no?\" Così mi avviai verso casa del mio amico.  \nBussai alla porta del mio amico numerose volte, ma lui non rispose mai, così provai a telefonargli e sentì il suo telefono squillare da dentro (o da fuori? fate voi). Pensai quindi che si fosse addormentato, lo mandai a quel paese (fanculo, un bel posto per passare le vacanze estive, secondo solo a Riccione) e tornai a casa.  \nIl giorno dopo bussò il postino con in mano un piccolo pacchetto, dicendo che era da parte del mio amico.  \nLo ringraziai e presi il pacchetto. Successivamente, accesi la tv mentre aprivo il piccolo pacchetto, molto piccolo ma anche molto pacchetto. C'era il TG in TV e sentì una notizia abbastanza sconcertante per me:Il mio amico era morto qualche ora prima che andassi a casa sua. Mi sentì quasi svenire e mi ritrovai con la cartuccia pokémon in mano, c'era scritto \"pokèmon: dongioni misteriosi demo\". Decisi di giocarci (perchè sono un coglione). Ero veramente frustrato e volevo qualcosa che potesse riavvicinarmi al mio amico ormai scomparso.  \nCosì accesi il mio GameBoy Advance SP color viola evidenziatore e **feci** uno strano test in cui diceva il colore della mia aura, scoprì di essere un charmender. Appena iniziato il gioco, mi si avvicinò un pokémon: un cubone che mi chiese \"che cos'è bamboocha?\" mi misi a piangere, era la pubblicità preferita del mio amico appena scomparso, che per comodità chiameremo \"Jimyumuumunukunukuapua\".  \n\"È triste perdere qualcuno.\"  Mi disse il cubone. \"Ma io posso riportarlo indietro.\" Così, in lacrime, accettai. Avrei fatto di tutto per riportare indietro Jimyumuumunukunukuapua.   \nCubone uscì dallo schermo del mio gameboy advance sp e mi baciò sulla fronte (mi diede una testata). Sentì la mia anima uscire dal mio corpo e divenni veramente un charmander... Entrai nel gioco e da lì vidi il mio amico Jimyumuumunukunukuapua, che teneva per mano la sua sorellina, morta anche lei sei anni fa, e allora capì: cubone aveva preso la nostra anima per far reincontrare le persone che abbiamo perduto. Piansi di gioia e così io e le altre anime, con cubone al centro, danzammo felici, perchè niente ci avrebbe potuto separare adesso.\n\nMorale: Tutto è Bamboocha, anche piccole cose di vita, come riunione di famiglia, fare nuove amicizie, una serata davanti al fuoco...

Though it’s a little ironic that I’m posting my story here since it was a creepy pasta podcast that led me to my current predicament. Now I’m not blaming them for my bodies current state, I made choice and they were the wrong ones. This one’s all on me. It just so happens that the episode of the podcast I was listening to was about urban legends and it led me to remember the bog lady.\n\nNow I’m sure that particular name hold no meaning to any of you reading this. But I wasn’t expecting it to, it’s an old urban legend about a woman that haunts a specific stretch of road between Halifax Nova Scotia and its popular tourist location of Peggy’s Cove. For those who were possibly thinking of visiting Peggy’s Cove on vacation have nothing to worry about. Firstly there is a highway you can take to get there and secondly the big lady only appears close to midnight on warm foggy nights on the long stretch of road that runs through Goodwood. The thicker the fog the more likely that you will see her. \n\nI’m sure you are wondering why she’s called the bog lady, I believe that it’s because that particular stretch of road is referred to by some as the long bog. I’m not sure if it was a bog before it became a quant little community, I never bothered to check. Now for the life of me I couldn’t remember what she did when she appeared. But luckily for me I had three lovely sisters to help me remember. Though we couldn’t remember much we did remember that her whole stick is to try and scare you into crashing your car. Of course after hearing that I did the completely rational white man thing of going to check if it was real. \n\nOf course I couldn’t do it immediately, after all she only comes out on warm nights when the fog along Goodwood is thick. So I decided to be productive as I waited for the conditions to be ideal. I spent my days off helping my eighty odd year old grandmother around her house and doing yard work since she lived just past Goodwood in the little neighbourhood of Prospect. Took almost three weeks of lawn mowing, repainting her house and Decluttering her basement for the perfect conditions to appear. \n\nTo say that I was excited on my drive home was an understatement. But as I got farther up the road and closer the mini put that unofficial marked the ending of Goodwood the more disappointed I felt. I must have been subconsciously hoping for my grandfathers stories to be true. I’m a huge fan of horror movies so I was really hoping that she’d appear. If she appeared than it hopefully meant that other myths and legends were also true. \n\nI don’t know if she was waiting for me to relax and let me guard down. But almost as soon as I gave up and felt the tension leave my shoulders my car seemed to start filling up with the fog that surounded my car despite my windows being closed. It funnelled its way through my vents and just about any other entry point that it could find. It slowly coalesced into the shape of a woman in my passenger seat. I couldn’t tell you exact details as to her looks, but that’s mostly because the fog was consistently shifting. Her body was constantly shifting fluidly through different body types  and her face never settled on any concrete features.\n\nTo say I was mesmerized and amazed by what I was an understatement. I could barely keep my eyes on the road, I couldn’t believe that my grandfathers story wasn’t just something he made up to scare us. I was so lucky that Good Wood  wasn’t a high traffic area  especially at night or I might have gotten into an accident with some innocent soul. I don’t believe in god but if I did I would have thanked him for that fact.\n\nWhat happened next is all kind of a blur. She turned her head towards me and let out the most ear piercing scream that I have ever had the unfortunate privilege of hearing. I was so startled by this sudden piercing sound that I jerked my own steering wheel towards on coming traffic instinctually trying to escape the excruciating pain thrumming through my eyes. Next thing I knew the car partially airborne, the screaming stopped and I could hear what sounded like the crunch of metal vaguely through the ringing in my ears. Then everything was black. \n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in the hospital  covered in bandages, a cast on my right arm and left leg. It turns out that I had several broken bones in both my arm and my leg, some stitches  on my face from where they had to remove some glass fragments and a good amount of stitches near my left shoulder where they had to remove a decent size tree branch from my body. I was apparently out for a good thirty hours and when I woke the doctors told me that I was really lucky to still be alive. It turns out that on the night of the accident there had been a nine one one just past my Nan’s neighbourhood. I was extremely lucky that no one had gotten injured at the scene. That meant that the ambulance that I hadn’t notice pull up behind me well I was distracted by the spectre in my passenger seat was there to watch me careen off the road into a rather firm tree. I’ll forever be thankful that they weren’t ferrying a patient back to the the hospital or I might have bleed out before I was found. \n\nI’m gonna wrap things up here however, the police will be here soon to question me about the crash and I’ve been told my roommates are on their way as well. I’m sure they’re gonna tear into me about how I’m not that kind of white and as a horror movie fanatic I should have known better. I’m not gonna tell you not to do this yourself, just make sure that if you do I really hope that you have nerves of steel or really good car insurance."},"819":{"title":"Shadow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f0dw52\/shadow\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"NeitMuta","selftext":"i left my grandfathers funeral and learned that he gave me his old house in Mexico that he owned.. its in the middle of nowhere my grandfather was a very wealthy man and owned a lot of property's and i do need a vacation so im on a flight there. around 4 hours later i landed i rented a car and im driving towards the location it will take me a while. This place is miles away from civilization the closer i get to it the more dead animals i find on the road. the drive felt longer then it was, i was exhausted. but at last i finally made it, i parked the car, got out of it and started walking towards the house. its a nice house, but as i got closer i did notice the parts that were out of shape. i was able to hear the house swaying as i walked up the steps to check out the inside, when i reached the door i took the keys to unlock the house.  it was old. very old. Everything was left behind old photos clothes everything. A few hours of cleaning i decided to look though my grandpas room and at the last drawer i saw a really old photo a picture of two babies one of my dad and the other of somone i haven't ever seen my dad never had a sibling. I never had a uncle. as i went to go lay down in the guest bedroom i noticed how cold it was. so so cold. i woke up  at [2:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pcomIWHY9Pw&amp;t=120s) i've never woken up so early before, or at least without a reason. i thought maybe it was because of the cold, but even then i have never woken up from being cold. i decided to go get some water to drink, so i got my flashlight and headed to the kitchen. i grabbed a water bottle since there is no water right now since the pipes are turned off. as i went back to the room i was sleeping in i heard something from the other side of the house. i thought maybe an animal got in so i decided to go check it out. i went outside and i saw a figure. A figure with white eyes and old clothes i was stunned with fear but as quick as they were here they where gone. I fell to my knees i felt weak i felt everything sucked out of me it was like a dream he had a hat on old clothed and a sword what he was gonna use that for i don't wanna know. i couldn't sleep for the rest of the night i know no one would believe me maybe i was dreaming. for around 2 hours i was catching up on some reading. it was extremely windy  i felt the plants scraping against some of the windows. I thought maybe a storm was coming this way but before i got on the plane i checked the weather, no sign of a storm. maybe the weather forecast had changed or i checked the wrong date, either way i had no signal and the wind was powerful. i kept an eye out for storm clouds but i didn't see any, the wind was way to powerful for a normal sunny day even though the sky was clear as day. every hour i waited the stronger it got to the point i was worried that the windows would break. the wind was howling i heard rain pouring  i realized i heard a child singing a song in Spanish. various women and men's limbs started getting thrown up from the grown i closed the blinds not daring to look soon everything stopped. it was quite way to quite i knew something was gonna happen just not what. i went back to reading trying to get my mind off of it my tears of pure fear dripping onto the pages. as soon as it ended it started again all over again the singing various things i assume that are limbs hitting the roof i didn't know what was going on, i didn't even know if i was safe myself. in what world is this normal? i started to question if coming here was a good idea. i got sick of sitting still trying to pretend everything is normal so i started walking around, maybe if i make myself tired and go to sleep everything will be normal again. i was trying not to panic but doing the same movements over and over again like some animal trapped in a cell with zoochosis wont help me out. but just like that everything fell silent like the birds before a storm. it was sudden. the silents was louder then it has ever been. the sudden change made me terrified. what was gonna happen next? its not like i can run out, its raining. why couldn't i hear the rain? or did it stop at the same time? I passed out hitting my head on the ground as soon as i woke up i immediately booked a flight back i needed to talk with my dad. tomorrow. tomorrow is the flight all i did the entire day was walk and walk and walk around outside just thinking as soon as the sun set i saw it. HIM  he spoke in a voice no one could quite make out yet understand perfectly he told me \" your time is up. even if you run even if you leave. ill still be there\" i ran i ran as far as i could until me legs hurt i knew he was running after me as well i looked back he stood on top of the house as soon as i  blinked he was closer he was taunting me. a bunch of rotten corpse's with missing limbs just stood as i ran like a line on two sides. i heard various ghastly voices all in one say \"its hell in here\"  soon i ran enough to a gas station i realized i left my car like hell I'm going back i thought. i sat down on the bench they had for the rest of the night. on the flight back i just thought about what i saw. i talked to my dad he confessed. he had a brother he told me what happened. they played catch in the middle of the night one of the rules that was said not to do the ball fell out of sight his brother went to go get it all he heard was screams he ran inside he told my grandfather he was yelled at for days  they cried for days upon days my dad said he should've told me and that he didn't know it would happen i didn't know what to think. i felt lied to i went back to my house and layed down as something went behind me and dragged me into the closet. this is my fate."},"820":{"title":"Big fatty spotted in Glasgow ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1f0gqx2\/big_fatty_spotted_in_glasgow\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Inevitable-One-249","selftext":"This big fatty waj was recently spotted in Glasgow, Scotland as part of a ongoing police investigation of the disappearance of up to 15 locals.

This creature can be any shade of gray and black to match the dark environment around. \nThe only thing that doesn't change are the eyes: two white balls.\nThe human being, up to 4 years of age, sees Darkness with his eyes, it is not known why after 4 years of age we see the figure without eyes, and from 6 years onwards we are no longer able to see it.\nPerhaps this creature has mutated so that the older it grows, the less it is seen, so it is easier for Dark to hunt.\nBe careful, because if the closest light is 200 meters away, or isn't there at all, it's guaranteed that Buio will be close to you. Darkness will always walk behind the subject, except when it stands in front or to the side for a few seconds, and when it is possible to see it, that event is called a “Hallucination”.\nFrom 10 minutes to 1 hour after his appearance, Dark will automatically teleport the subject to a pocket dimension, dark and where there are only corridors, the walls cannot be knocked down and are covered in black and sticky substances. Dark is in total command here, he can even turn that place into anything else. He will start hunting you, but so far only one person has managed to survive. Estimated total number of victims who entered there? From the first man until now, approximately 2 billion, and some even hypothesize up to 3 billion. \nThe only way to escape Good is to use a light source within that dimension, though in all cases it will be disintegrated upon entering the dimension. The only subject who managed to escape was because fortunately his phone had not disappeared, and so he activated the flashlight, pointed it in Buio's face and released him.\nAfter that event, the subject hypothesized that this was true hell, absolute darkness, where perhaps the dead are souls who wander in the dimension, aimlessly, forever.\n\nCreepypasta designed and written by Millix Fox (u\/TheDuckyOfReddit)"},"829":{"title":"Three videos from Philippines, Colombia and Peru, Clear video footage of a UFO.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ezu2zz\/three_videos_from_philippines_colombia_and_peru\/","flair":"Video","author":"forhealthy","selftext":"Interesting UFO video scenes from different places, watch them and tell me what you think.\n\nTwo exciting videos, filmed in the Philippines and Colombia, clear video footage of a UFO.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w\\_JHO8ifHiI](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w_JHO8ifHiI)\n\nClear video footage of a UFO, at a high altitude in the sky of Peru.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=\\_N9ucCQWVDE](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_N9ucCQWVDE)"},"830":{"title":"The Ghostly Sands Of Galveston","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ezswr2\/the_ghostly_sands_of_galveston\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Beware the Ghostly Sands of Galveston, where whispers of lost souls linger in the salty breeze. 👻🏝️ #HauntedBeaches #SpectralShores #EerieVacationSpot Discover the chilling secrets that lie beneath the sun-kissed surface, as the ocean's depths hold dark mysteries waiting to be unraveled.

It was unlinked so nobody else watched it. IDK why this was sent to me, maybe he thought that I had a change of mind back then. I finally watched it on May when I had a change of mind. I thought that this was not shown to you guys mainly because it made fun of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe video starts off with SMG4 digging through his old memes. then SMG3 annoyed him with a full on Nuclear bomb he had for who knows how long. SMG4 hates it (as usual), and complains to SMG3 telling him that he was banned in several states because of that.

Growing up in a small town where everyone knew each other, my friends and I spent our days exploring the woods and fields that surrounded our neighborhood. It was the summer of 15 years ago, the summer when we met Bernard.\n\nMichael, Zachary, and I were inseparable. Michael was the kind of kid who could make friends with anyone; he had a smile that could light up a room and a laugh that was contagious. Zachary was different. He was half friend, half bully, always teasing and testing us, but in his own way, he was loyal. The three of us had our own little world, a realm of adventure and secrets that only we knew.\n\nOne afternoon, while we were playing hide-and-seek in the woods behind Zachary’s house, we stumbled upon a boy we had never seen before. He was sitting on a fallen tree, staring at the ground. He looked about our age, maybe a year or two older, with dark, tousled hair and piercing blue eyes.\n\n“Hey, who are you?” Michael called out, always the first to extend a hand.\n\nThe boy looked up, his expression unreadable. “Bernard,” he said softly.\n\n“I’ve never seen you around before,” I said, stepping closer. “Do you go to our school?”\n\nBernard shook his head. “Just moved here.”\n\n“Cool,” Michael said, grinning. “You wanna play with us?”\n\nBernard nodded, a small smile tugging at his lips. We welcomed him into our group, and for the rest of the day, we ran through the woods, playing games and climbing trees. Bernard was quiet, almost shy, but there was something about him that intrigued us. He moved with a strange grace, his eyes always watchful, as if he were constantly on guard.\n\nZachary, true to form, tested Bernard’s boundaries. He teased him, called him names, but Bernard never reacted the way Zachary expected. He would simply stare at Zachary, his expression calm and composed, until Zachary would eventually give up and move on.\n\nOne day, Zachary brought his disposable camera, one of those old ones with the film you had to get developed. “Let’s take a picture,” he said, gathering us together.\n\nWe huddled close, Bernard standing slightly apart, and Zachary snapped the picture. It captured a moment in time, the four of us smiling and carefree. That picture would later become a haunting reminder of the events that would unfold.\n\nAs the summer wore on, Bernard’s presence became a regular part of our days. He never spoke much about his family or where he lived, and whenever we asked, he would change the subject. But we didn’t mind; we were just happy to have another friend.\n\nThen, one day, Bernard didn’t show up. We waited at our usual spot in the woods, but he never came. The next day was the same, and the day after that. Weeks turned into months, and we never saw Bernard again. We assumed he had moved away, as mysteriously as he had arrived.\n\nLife went on. The years passed, and our childhood adventures became distant memories. I joined the police force, driven by a desire to protect and serve. It was a job that required me to face the darkest aspects of humanity, but it also gave me a sense of purpose.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, while cleaning out my attic, I stumbled upon a box of old photos. Among them was the picture Zachary had taken that summer. I stared at it, a flood of memories washing over me. There we were, Michael, Zachary, Bernard, and me, captured in a moment of innocent joy.\n\nA strange feeling settled in my gut. Bernard’s face seemed to stare back at me, his eyes more intense than I remembered. I took the photo to work the next day, unable to shake the feeling that something was off. I showed it to a colleague who specialized in cold cases.\n\n“Hey, take a look at this,” I said, handing him the photo. “Do you recognize this kid?”\n\nHe examined it closely, his brow furrowing. “Give me a second.” He walked over to his desk and began sifting through files. After a few minutes, he pulled out a faded document and compared it to the photo.\n\n“This is Bernard,” he said, his voice hushed. “Bernard Thompson. He went missing almost thirty years ago. It’s one of our oldest cold cases.”\n\nA chill ran down my spine. How could Bernard have been missing for thirty years when we met him only fifteen years ago? It didn’t make sense. Driven by a hunch, I decided to investigate further.\n\nI returned to the woods where we used to play, the place where we had first met Bernard. The trees had grown thicker, the paths more overgrown, but it was still the same place. I walked deeper into the woods, my mind racing with possibilities.\n\nAs I reached a small clearing, I noticed something half-buried in the underbrush. It was a piece of fabric, tattered and weathered by time. I knelt down, my heart pounding, and began to dig. The earth was damp and heavy, but I kept at it, my hands trembling with a mixture of fear and determination.\n\nThen, I saw it. A skeletal hand, fingers curled as if reaching for something. I unearthed the rest of the remains, my breath catching in my throat. There, in the shallow grave, lay the skeletal remains of a child, long forgotten and alone.\n\nI called for backup, my mind numb with shock. As we waited for the forensic team to arrive, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Bernard was still watching me, his piercing blue eyes following my every move.\n\nThe investigation confirmed what I already knew. The remains belonged to Bernard Thompson, a boy who had gone missing nearly thirty years ago. But the mystery of how he had appeared to us, fifteen years ago, remained unsolved.\n\nI often think back to that summer, to the strange, quiet boy who appeared out of nowhere and then vanished just as suddenly. Bernard’s ghost, or whatever he had been, left an indelible mark on our lives. Michael and Zachary, when I told them what I had discovered, were as bewildered as I was.\n\nWe may never know the full truth of what happened, but I can’t help but feel that Bernard was trying to tell us something. Perhaps his restless spirit sought companionship, a way to reach out and be remembered. Or maybe there are things in this world that we simply cannot understand, forces beyond our comprehension that shape our destinies.\n\nWhatever the case, I know one thing for certain: some mysteries are meant to remain unsolved, lingering in the shadows of our past, forever haunting our memories."},"836":{"title":"I’m trying to find a story about a man wearing animal skin…","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ezr06t\/im_trying_to_find_a_story_about_a_man_wearing\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"NoCommunication1470","selftext":"Hey everyone, I’m trying to find a story.

The story is about something known as “The Naljek,” if you know about it, you’ll never look at the streetlights in Fort Wayne the same way again.\n\nIt starts with the lights—those old, yellow streetlights that dot the streets of the older parts of town. They flicker sometimes, right? It’s normal, everyone says. Old wiring, a power surge, maybe even a bulb on its last legs. But some people in Fort Wayne know better. They’ve seen something, something that can’t be explained away by faulty electricity.\n\nThey say it only happens at night, usually in the dead hours when the streets are empty and the town is blanketed in a heavy, suffocating silence. If you’re unlucky enough to be alone, walking under those flickering lights, you might notice it—a brief shadow, an unnatural movement at the edge of your vision, just beyond the reach of the light. Most people brush it off, thinking it’s just their imagination. But if you stop and pay attention, you might glimpse something more.\n\nIt’s always at the edge of the light, never evident, but unmistakably there. A figure, humanoid but wrong in every sense. It is too tall and thin, its limbs are too long, and its movements are too jerky. Its skin is pale, almost translucent, but it has no face—just a smooth, featureless surface where its eyes, nose, and mouth should be. It lingers just outside the circle of light, where the darkness is thickest, as if the shadows are its home.\n\nSome say it feeds on fear. The more terrified you are, the closer it gets. It won’t chase you, not like in the movies. No, it’s far more patient than that. It simply watches, follows, and waits. The lights start flickering more violently the closer it gets, as if the very presence of this thing is disrupting the electrical flow.\n\nThere’s a trick people in Fort Wayne talk about—something passed down from those who’ve had close encounters with The Naljek and lived to tell the tale. If you find yourself under those flickering lights and you sense it, whatever you do, don’t run. Don’t show it that you’re afraid. Stand your ground, and keep your eyes forward. Pretend you don’t see it, even if you can feel it getting closer, even if the air around you grows cold and thick like it’s pressing down on your chest. If you run, you’re done. It will follow you, and the more you try to escape, the more persistent it becomes. It will never stop. Not until you’re driven mad, or worse.\n\nThere are old newspaper clippings—hidden deep in the archives—about disappearances in Fort Wayne that go back decades, maybe even longer. Stories of people who vanished without a trace, last seen walking home late at night under those flickering lights. The police never found any leads, signs of a struggle, or witnesses. But some people know the truth. They know The Naljek got them.\n\nAnd then there’s the old Fort Wayne rumor about the missing persons who returned—only they weren’t the same. The few found wandering days or weeks after they disappeared can’t remember where they were or what happened. They’re different—vacant, hollow. They don’t talk about what they saw, but sometimes, in the dead of night, their neighbors hear them muttering, whispering about the lights, the shadows, something lurking just beyond their vision.\n\nOver time, people in Fort Wayne have learned to ignore the flickering lights, to pretend they don’t see the strange, shadowy figure at the edge of the darkness. They walk quickly, keep their heads down, and pray they make it home before the lights go out completely. Because once they do, there’s no escape.\n\nAnd now that you know, you’ll never forget. You’ll think about it the next time you see a streetlight flicker, the next time you’re out late at night, and you feel like you’re not alone. You’ll try to tell yourself it’s just a story, just a creepy tale told to scare people. But deep down, you’ll wonder. You’ll wonder if it’s out there, watching, waiting, just at the edge of the light.\n\nAnd if you’re ever in Fort Wayne, Indiana, walking under those flickering lights—don’t look back. Don’t show it you’re afraid. Just keep walking and hope the lights don’t go out."},"840":{"title":"Recommendations to scare the crap out of my friend?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ez2syh\/recommendations_to_scare_the_crap_out_of_my_friend\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"UniKath","selftext":"So I'm planning on going on a multi-day camping trip with my best friend in about a week and we're planning on reading scary stories to each other around the campfire to try and scare each other.

What happened a few years ago was one of the scariest things I've ever encountered in a game. I was around 19 at the time; I'm 21 now. I was playing TF2 like anyone else—buying crates and unboxing them, hoping to get something good. I bought a Mann Co. Supply Crate, not expecting anything special. But when I unlocked it, I was surprised. I got an unusual hat: a Burning Flames Mining Light.\n\nSomething about the hat seemed... off. The image displayed in the inventory was a little dark, like it had been recolored. I shrugged it off, thinking it was just a visual glitch, and queued up for a match on Dustbowl. When I got in, I picked Engineer and equipped the new hat. As soon as I put it on, the game froze.\n\n\"Weird,\" I said to myself. I used to have terrible internet, so I wasn't too concerned. After a couple of minutes, the game came back, but the map was... silent. Just before the freeze, I had heard gunfire and the sound of an Engineer building. Now, nothing. Dead quiet.\n\nI was on Blu team, so I decided to walk around and see if I could find anyone. To my surprise, the map was completely empty. I checked the scoreboard—only me and one other person on Red team. I typed into the chat, \"Do you know where everyone else is?\"\n\nNo response.\n\nI was starting to get annoyed. Maybe the other guy didn't speak English? The game was already on Stage 3, with only Control Point B left to capture. I figured I'd just finish the round, so I headed towards the point. But as I approached the Red team's area, my game froze again. Then, out of nowhere, it disconnected and reconnected me to a new match.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I whispered, trying not to wake my family.\n\nThe new map loaded. It was called \"Outbound.\" Just \"Outbound.\" No game mode prefix like `ctf_` for Capture the Flag. Just a single, ominous word.\n\nI spawned on the Red team and picked Engineer again. The map was... strange. It's hard to explain how, but it felt wrong. I walked out of spawn and into the main map area—it was a long, dark sewer, using the exact same models from the sewers in 2Fort. I walked through the tunnels for about three minutes before I decided to disconnect.\n\nI tried to leave the game, but nothing happened. I clicked the disconnect button, and nothing. Pressing the Windows key didn’t open the start menu. Alt + F4 didn’t work either. Even the Steam overlay wouldn't pop up. I felt trapped. My only option was to keep moving forward.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes of walking, I stopped dead in my tracks. Ahead of me, there was another Engineer—wearing the exact same loadout as me, right down to the Burning Flames Mining Light. But his hat... the flames were a deep, crimson red, like fresh blood.\n\nI pulled out my pistol and shot at him. The bullets hit, but the Engineer didn’t react. He just stood there, staring. I checked the scoreboard. I was still the only player on the server.\n\nHeart pounding, I slowly started to back away, firing my shotgun as I went. Suddenly, the Engineer began to walk towards me. His movements were wrong, his limbs twisting and stretching in impossible ways, like someone had used the Heavy's animation on him.\n\nPanic set in. I quickly built a dispenser, hoping to use it as a barrier, but the Engineer just phased right through it. I kept backing up until I was stopped by a wall that hadn’t been there before. My exit was blocked. Trapped, I fired until I had to reload.\n\nAs the Engineer reached me, the game crashed. A loud, distorted sound blasted through my headphones, so loud it almost knocked me out of my chair. I ripped the headphones off and stared at the screen—blue. The Blue Screen of Death.\n\nMy heart was racing as I quickly restarted my computer. When it booted up, everything seemed normal. Hesitantly, I opened *Team Fortress 2*. I checked my inventory, and my Burning Flames Mining Light was gone.\n\nWhatever had happened—whether it was a hacker or something more sinister—left me rattled. It felt like a ghost had invaded my game.\n\n**Update:** Two weeks after this happened, *Team Fortress 2* got an update. The patch notes were mostly standard stuff, but one line stood out: \"Fixing players wearing Burning Flames Mining Light disconnecting from server.\"\n\nWhatever happened to me, it wasn’t just a one-time glitch. It must’ve happened to other people, too. I’m not sure if I want to find out more... or if I should just let it go and stay far, far away from TF2.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Anyway uh, this is my first written story. so sorry if there some mistake]"},"843":{"title":"Mystery Man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ez12k1\/mystery_man\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Erutious","selftext":"I was just looking for something to make my end-of-summer sleepover amazing.\n\n\n\nWhat I got was a sleepover that no one would ever forget.\n\n\n\nMargo, Jenny, and I had been friends for years, since Kindergarten even, and we were getting ready to start seventh grade in a few days and wanted to hold our annual slumber party. I had the pigs in a blanket made, the chips that Margo liked, the sour gummy worms for Jenny, and a huge bottle of Doctor Fizz for us to share. I was getting the movies ready when I realized that I hadn't found our favorite game yet and started hunting through the closet.\n\n\n\nWe had played Mall Madness, a game my mom had given me from when she was young, and it was a hit at any sleepover. We would shop till we drop, charge it up, and then laugh about who got the best deals and spent the least amount of money. It was great, I had probably replaced the batteries in it a dozen times or more, but I just couldn't find it anywhere. It had always been at the top of my closet, right beside my old Barbie travel case, but today it was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nI blew out in exasperation, wondering where it could be, but ultimately decided to go check the attic. It had come from the attic, so maybe Mom had put it back up there. I pulled down the ladder, glad it was still daylight so it didn't look so spooky, and went looking for Mall Madness. It was kind of a chore because Mom is something of a hoarder. Dad calls her a \"Pack Rat\" and it seems pretty fitting. She keeps everything. She had clothes from when my sister and I were little kids, she's got school art projects, she had boxes of old photos and memory books, and all kinds of things. I pushed aside a bunch of dresses and found an area dominated by old toys and games that she had saved. It was a mishmash of dolls, books, some old dollhouses, and a couple of dusty board games.\n\n\n\nI didn't find Mall Madness, but I found about seven others. Apples to Apples was for babies, Uncle Wiggly sounded kind of weird, Don't Wake Daddy was missing pieces (some of which I had lost), and Monopoly took too long. I was about to give up when I saw a black box at the bottom of the stack that I didn't think I had ever seen before. It was covered in dust, the letters barely visible, and as I pulled it out, tugging it quickly so the other boxes wouldn't fall, I wiped off the cover and read the red letter slowly, the red on black hard to read since it was so faded.\n\nMystery Man the name proclaimed, and I was about to open it to see the instructions when my mom called to let me know my friends were here and I ran downstairs to see them.\n\n\n\nI tossed the game onto my bed as I ran past, figuring we would check it out late, and we were soon all laughing and jumping as we got excited for tonight.\n\n\n\nWe ate dinner, we played hide and seek in the backyard, we hung out in my tree house, and as it started to get dark we came in to watch movies, play games, and start the rest of the evening's activities. Dad worked nights and Mom didn't really ever make us go to bed when we were having sleepovers. We usually passed out sometime around midnight, but tonight we wanted to stay up till we heard my Dad pull in from work. We wanted to see if we could stay up till dawn, just to see if we could, and we had enough snacks and sugar to manage it, we thought.\n\n\n\nBy eleven thirty we had watched two movies, eaten most of the snacks, drank half a bottle of soda, and braided each other's hair during the end of Balto. We were a little bored with movies and Jenny asked if we could play Mall Madness for a little bit. That was when I remembered the game and told them I had something different in mind tonight. The game had worked its way half under my pillow somehow and when I pulled it out, my friends Oooed and Awwed at it appreciatively.\n\n\n\nWe opened the box and found a blackboard with silver spaces, the big orange phone in the middle having an honest-to-God spin dial on it. We had cards with descriptions on them, and it felt more like we were assembling a police sketch than a dream date. We would go around the board, landing on spaces and drawing cards, and when we found a card with a number on it, we would dial the number and it would help us determine the identity of our mystery man.\n\n\n\n\"So it's a little like Dream Date, then,\" Margo said.\n\n\n\n\"Seems weird,\" Jenny said, \"Like we're hunting him or something.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at the instructions but they gave no particular instructions on the purpose for making a description of the guy. We would take turns until we had assembled our mystery man and then we would call triple 0 on the phone and give our description to the person on the other end. Somehow they would know if it was right or not and tell us we had won or tell us to try again.\n\n\n\n\"Simple enough,\" I said, and I picked up the dice and rolled first.\n\n\n\nIt was about four turns later when Jenny landed on a card that gave her a phone call. She tried to dial, but she was having some trouble until I showed her how the rotary phone worked. Mom had shown me, saying that was how they used to call people a million years ago, and once she got the number plugged in, she held the phone against her head and waited for the click. Someone came on after three rings, a weird staticy voice that I didn't much like, and whatever it told Jenny, she didn't seem to like it either. After a few minutes, she put the phone down, her hands shaking a little.\n\n\n\n\"Well?\" Margo asked, \"What did it say?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm,\" Jenny cleared her throat, clearly trying to get in control of herself, \"I'm not supposed to tell anyone. The phone man said the call was just for me.\"\n\n\n\nShe handed me the dice, her hand very sweaty and a little shaky, and we continued.\n\n\n\nIt was my turn to use the phone next, but Margo pulled out a card and laid it down. The card let her steal my phone call and I laughed a little as I stuck my tongue out at her. She dialed the number and held the phone, interested to hear what was to come. None of us thought it was real, well, Margo and I didn't, but Jenny scooted a little away as she made her call.\n\n\n\nThe voice picked up, said something quick and harsh and Margo's smile slipped off her face as she listened.\n\n\n\nHer lip was trembling as she put the phone down, and she wrote something on a piece of paper and shook her head when I tried to pass her the dice.\n\n\n\n\"The guy on the phone said to let you roll again. He said some other stuff, but I'm not supposed to say.\"\n\n\n\nI rolled again and grumbled as I landed just shy of a phone space. I wanted to hear what had them so spooked. This was a board game, ages ten and up and all that, and there was no way it could be that terrifying. We continued taking turns, the girls wanting to keep playing despite their obvious discomfort, and finally, I got my wish. I drew a card after landing on the spot and it was the phone booth, *Search the deck for a phone call card and dial the number.* I took the first one I found and dialed the number, letting it ring five times before someone picked up.\n\n\n\n*\"The Mystery Man is a blonde, about six foot tall, in a wide-brimmed hat. That's for your ears only, toots, so don't tell any of those other little bitches what I said, I'll know.\"*\n\n\n\nThat was a little weird and I put the phone down with some hesitation. I didn't think they could say things like that in a board game like this. Margo and Jenny didn't bother to ask what he'd said, and I made notes as Margo took her turn. I had a blonde card and a wide-brimmed hat card, but I didn't have one that said six feet tall. I guessed I would just have to draw for it. Meanwhile, Margo had gotten another phone call and as she listened, I saw her glance over at Jenny and the look didn't seem friendly. I didn't know what the phone guy was telling her, but it seemed to be making her mad.\n\n\n\nWe played the game for hours, and in that time, the game got worse and worse.\n\n\n\nAnytime Jenny got a phone call it nearly put her in tears.\n\n\n\nAnytime Margo got a phone call it seemed to make her angrier and angrier.\n\n\n\nI tried to take the phone from Jenny at one point, offering to take the call for her, but she shook her head and told me the phone man said she had to take it, whether she liked it or not.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Margo said, her eyes looking mean, \"She needs to take her calls just like the rest of us.\"\n\n\n\nAs the game went on, we got more clues. I learned that my Mystery Man was a six-foot-tall blonde in a wide-brimmed hat with a mustache, black pants, and a white shirt. I had most of that, but I was still missing the six-foot card and the mustache. The man on the phone had alluded to the fact that Margo would soon make her move against Jenny, the two being like dogs ready to fight, and when Margo threw down a card, it looked more like a knife toss than a friendly showing.\n\n\n\n\"White glove, I get to take one of your cards, Jenny.\"\n\n\n\nJenny nodded, holding her card out like a fan and Margo picked the fourth one, pulling it back smugly before glowering at it.  \n\n\n\n\"You switched it,\" she accused, flipping it around to show the Green Sweater card.\n\n\n\nJenny shook her head, \"Nu-uh.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, you did!\" Margo accused, \"The phone man said you were a cheater, but I didn't want to believe him at first. Looks like he was right.\"  \n\n\n\n\"I never cheated,\" Jenny said, almost crying.\n\n\n\n\"Then why wasn't this the Green Scarf card? The phone guy,\" but she brought her teeth together, hard, and it sounded like wood clacking together.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" I asked, \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing,\" Margo said, \"Doesn't matter. Just play the game.\"\n\n\n\nJenny didn't look like she wanted to continue playing, but she didn't look like she was capable of stopping either. The game would continue whether we wanted to or not, and after that, the phone calls got even weirder.\n\n\n\nI pulled a card, dialed the number, and was greeted with about ten seconds of heavy breathing before he spoke.\n\n\n\n*\"The mystery man has a long, sharp knife. He's walking down the street, turning left on Martin Drive, and will soon be there.\"*\n\n\n\nThat sent a chill through me. Martin Drive, that was two streets away. That was like an easy twenty-minute walk. What the heck was this? These weren't prerecordings. This had to be live, but that was impossible. This game was probably twenty years old at least.\n\n\n\nIt couldn't happen.\n\n\n\n\"Look,\" I said, hanging up the phone, \"let's just call this a draw. I think this is getting a little too real and,\"\n\n\n\nThe orange phone rang, and I felt my words wither in my mouth as we just sat there and looked at it. It was like watching a bomb tick down, none of us wanting to be the one to touch it. It just kept ringing, and ringing, and finally, to my surprise, Jenny reached out to pick it up. Her hand shook, her breath coming in quick gasps, and as she lifted it to her ear, I heard someone snarl something and she winced like she'd been struck.\n\n\n\nShe held the phone out for me, hand moving like someone with nerve damage, and said it as for me.\n\n\n\nI took it, held it to my ear, and said hello.\n\n\n\n*\"Whether you play the game or not, you little bitch, the Mystery Man is still coming. If none of you wins when he's coming to get all of you, but if one of you manages to win, then they might be safe. You never know. Better finish what you started.\"*   \n\n\n\nI hung up the phone, trying to keep my teeth from chattering as I told them what he had said.\n\n\n\n\"That's not true,\" Margo said at once, \"the phone guy told me that I had to beat Jenny or I'd get taken. He said Jenny was trying to win on purpose so the Mystery Man would get me.\"\n\n\n\nJenny burst into tears, \"He said that you two were trying to sacrifice me to the Mystery Man and that I deserved it. He said I was useless, just holding you two back, and I deserved to get dragged away.\"\n\n\n\nI thought about it, weighing what they had said, \"Sounds like if we all win, then he can't get us at all. We have to work together to get out of this.\"\n\n\n\nJenny shook her head, \"He said that if I told you what my Mystery Man looked like, he'd get me for sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me too,\" Margo said, her anger slowly turning into fear.\n\n\n\n\"Well, who cares what he says? He's coming, regardless, so we have to do something.\"\n\n\n\nSo, we started playing the game cooperatively.\n\n\n\nHelping each other proved a better strategy, and Margo soon had everything for her mystery man. Margo dialed triple zero and declared that her Mystery Man was five foot four and bald, with a hockey mask, a machete, and a white jumpsuit. A voice came from the rotary, making us all jump with its suddenness, as it reverberated around the room.\n\n\n\n*\"You have discovered your mystery man, Margo. You are safe, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nWe were still for a moment, and then Jenny reluctantly picked up the dice and kept playing. She got a card, dialed the number, and choked out a sob as the man on the phone told her about her Mystery Man.\n\n\n\n\"He's on your street,\" she said, sobbing a little, and I rolled the dice so we could get to her turn again.\n\n\n\n\"White Glove,\" I said, \"Lemme see them.\"\n\n\n\nJenny held up her card, but she started nodding at one that was five into the stack.\n\n\n\nI drew it and, sure enough, it was the mustache.\n\n\n\nNow all I needed was the six-foot tall and the knife.\n\n\n\nJenny went again, drew a card, and breathed a sigh of relief as she dialed triple zero.\n\n\n\n\"My Mystery man is Six feet tall, dark-haired, with a rope and a long coat.\"\n\n\n\nThe phone made the sound again and declared, \"*Jenny, you have discovered your Mystery Man. You are safe, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nI had picked up the dice when I heard something creak the door open downstairs. It was long and loud, like a funhouse door at the carnival. I tossed the dice, moved my piece, and drew a card. It was a phone call and I threw it away and rolled again. I moved, drew, and pumped my fist as I got the six-foot card.\n\n\n\nI was rolling again when the phone began to ring.\n\n\n\nIt barely covered the sound of a footstep on the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\n\nI let it ring, rolling and moving like a madman. I drew but it wasn't what I needed. I got another phone card and threw it away. I could hear my Mystery Man on the stairs, moving as slow as any horror movie villain. I drew the gun and cursed as I tossed it away. I drew another white glove card, but I tossed it and kept rolling and moving. I could hear him on the stairs, his boots clumping menacingly. I had to find the knife. I had to banish this Mystery Man. If I didn't, it would be my death.\n\n\n\nHe came onto the landing when the ringing phone became too much and I picked it up and put it down again. It started to ring after a few seconds and I did it again before moving my piece. I could still hear his boots in the hallway that led to my room, and they grew louder by the second.\n\nJenny and Margo were watching the door to my bedroom like it might explode, but I was focused on my task.\n\n\n\nRope, tossed.\n\n\n\n*clump clump clump*\n\n\n\nA wide-brimmed hat, tossed.\n\n\n\n*clump clump clump*\n\n\n\nHe was walking past my little sister's room now. He'd pass Mom and Dad's room after that, and then it would be down to my room at the end of the hall. What would happen if he got me? \n\n\n\nWould they even believe Margo and Jenny? Would the Mystery Man leave them alone once he got me? I didn't know but...\n\n\n\nMy heart lept into my throat.\n\n\n\nI had the knife, I was done.\n\n\n\nI dialed triple zero as something opened the door to my room.\n\n\n\nJenny and Margo gasped, sliding away from the board and as far from the door as they could get.\n\n\n\n\"My Mystery Man had blonde hair, a wide-brimmed hat, is six feet tall, has black pants and a white shirt, and a knife.\"\n\n\n\nI practically screamed it into the phone, falling forward to cover it as I expected that long, sharp knife to stab into me at any minute.\n\n\n\nI heard the tone and then heard the phone crackle out, *\"That was a close one, Heather. You're safe from your Mystery Man, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nI just lay there for a while, panting and trembling, as Margo and Jenny came to comfort me. \n\n\n\nThey told me they had seen him standing in the doorway, his blonde hair spilling beneath his hat and a sharp knife in his hand. He had raised it, took a single step, and then just disappeared into nothingness. We lay there, just kind of basking in the feeling of still being alive until I heard Dad pull into the driveway.\n\n\n\nWe had made it, we stayed up till sunrise, just like we wanted to.\n\n\n\nI went down and hugged my dad, who seemed surprised I was still awake but glad to see me and then the three of us turned in.\n\n\n\nI put Mystery Man back in the attic and have never touched it again.\n\n\n\nOne brush with death was enough for me.\n\n\n\nSo if you find a copy of your own while trolling through the thrift stores and antique malls in your area, be very careful with it.\n\n\n\nThe Mystery Man you find might not be a mystery for very long.Mystery Man"},"844":{"title":"My life as a closet.

It's my only favourite thing in the whole wide world. \n\nA thought arises in my own mind and I asked myself, do we just enjoy just enjoy the taste and not the exterior of where that taste belongs? Or vice versa. The reason this question came to my mind is because when I went to eat an apple last week, it didn't taste like an apple but rather it tasted like raw red meat. I spat it out. I tried eating tangerines and it tasted like hot disgusting cabbage soup. This Waa terrible and everyone in my area was having the same experience. We were experiencing some sort of taste distortion. \n\nChocolates didn't taste like chocolate anymore but it tasted like vegetables. Vegetables tasted like sweets and no body knew what they could eat anymore. This raised many more questions like if something didn't taste like something was it still the same thing? Also if meat tasted like vegetables could vegetarians eat it? And so on and so forth. I kept trying to eat apples and tangerines but they both tasted like raw meat. It was horrible and if they both tasted like raw meat did they still give the vitamins that fruit give?

Together, they work at Grunkle Stan’s tourist trap “The Mystery Shack” alongside Soos and Wendy Corduroy. It is there that Dipper would discover a journal cataloging all the mysterious anomalies that plague the town.\n\nOf course, the show was best remembered because of its use of cryptograms such as the Caesar cipher among other varieties of encrypted puzzles. In fact, shortly after the series finale was aired, a real-life Cipher hunt was orchestrated by series creator Alex Hirsch himself which spanned countries beginning in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and, appropriately ending in Reedsport, Oregon. And it is there, somewhere in the woods that the victors who decoded the mystery were met with a statue of an... old friend.\n\nFans of the show are more than familiar with the sinister Dream Demon Bill Cipher, but for those who slept on the show, Bill Cipher was the main antagonist of the series, a triangular fiend from the Second Dimension who was originally meant to be a one-off character before he was promoted. To keep the spoilers to a minimum, Bill wanted to merge his decaying dimension, the Nightmare Realm, with the Earth succeeding at his goal in “Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future” when he deceived a despondent Mabel. He rained weirdness on the entirety of Gravity Falls in an apocalyptic event dubbed Weirdmageddon driving people to the brink of insanity with his Bubbles of Pure Madness and transforming others into stone statues and creating a Throne of Frozen Human Agony from them.\n\nHowever, despite his near victory, Bill is predictably defeated, leaving his physical form behind to get an equation which prevented him from spreading his weirdness to the rest of the world. While the show ended on a great note with the day saved, it left a plethora of questions, the most damning one being on the demonic triangle himself. Was Bill truly dead, or could there be a chance he could return to wreak havoc on the Pines family?\n\nThis question lingered for years and was only further muddled with the subsequent releases of books to expand the universe of *Gravity Falls*. The most alarming one was written from the perspective of the Dream Demon himself, which begged the question: if Bill was dead, how could he be writing the book? Was he in some weird afterlife, preferably Hell for all the atrocities he committed throughout the trillions of years he was alive? Or was he hiding in the deepest regions of Grunkle Stan’s mind? *The Book of Bill* promised to reveal Bill’s origins and ultimately clear up where he had been for all those years since the show finished production.\n\nNaturally, the book is classic Bill with its morbid, dark humor, and, to its credit, it did reveal Bill’s backstory... or at least bits of it that put together. Even in the original cartoon it was common knowledge that Bill was a native of the Second Dimension where, as he put it, was a realm containing nothing but flat dreams, flat minds, and a flat world. It was then that Bill “liberated” his dimension, and he did such an exceedingly excellent job at it that... the dimension no longer exists. Everyone was dead, even his parents.\n\nWhile the book could be summed up as being just nonsense that Bill wrote to ensnare a hapless victim to possess and start Weirdmageddon anew, what made this an even more interesting turning point is the creation of a tie-in website “thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com.” The site could be best described as being additional pages of *The Book of Bill* that were left on the drawing board detailing more lore to the series and giving some funny responses. Just try typing in “Ted Cruz” and you would be introduced to a popup that informs you that you violated standards and practices and therefore you must have your mouth washed out. Or if you typed in “Skibidi” you are met with the lovely message that your life privileges are revoked. Then there were the... not-so-funny responses like what happens if you type in “Stanley” one-too-many times.\n\nAfter hearing about the website, I decided to visit the website. I was met with several interesting visuals like a human skull with a gold tooth; an eye in a jar; a copy of *The Book of Bill* with a dagger stabbed into it. Best of all, the low beat of the show’s theme song complimented the mysterious aura that took me back to when I first watched the cartoon. I soaked in the atmosphere for a few more seconds before I remembered the reason I logged onto the website.\n\nI started off with the codes I already was familiar with ranging from the names of the main characters and was met with amusing results. I then thought of ones off the top of my head to see if they also worked. If you were to type Season 1 into the computer, you’d get “Anti-Gravity Falls” for one, or Season 1 if you plugged in Season 2. As I further experimented with the outcomes, my mind directed me towards Cipher again. However, I had already used “Bill,” “triangle,” and “Bill Cipher” so I needed to think of something else... maybe on some of his classifications. Given the terminology that he was a Dream Demon, the most sense was to type “dream.”\n\nSo... I did. I wrote out “dream” and pressed enter. Red flashed from the computer denoting that the word was not one of the codes. I was disappointed, but I remembered how there were tricks to some of the words, so I pressed the enter key again. But like before, no slice. However, I was not one to just give up after the first two goes. I pressed enter again and again in rapid succession only for the same blaring to ring out.\n\nIt was the very definition of insanity I admit, but if it provided me with answers to Bill’s nature, I would have felt obligated. Eventually, the pyramid placeholder on the computer glitched as a new message popped up:\n\nPA'Z UVA TF MHBSA PA'Z UVA TF MHBSA PA'Z UVA TF MHBSA TF LFL... P JHU ZAPSS ZLL AOL IBYUPUN IVKPLZ... PA OBYAZ PA OBYAZ... WSLHZL ZVTLVUL AHRL HDHF AOL WHPU!!!\n\nI could practically hear Bill railing against me the further I typed the word into the password interface. The screen glitched and flashed in vibrant colors undoubtedly representing a color code. Clearly whatever was going on indicated that whatever was happening was working to my favor. It must have taken me thirty times, but the website appeared to relent. Another message fizzled up asking me if I really wanted to know the deep dark secret this time offering me a yes or no option. I chose the former, and after it stalled for a few seconds, it sent me a link to a video with the simple title of “Remember Euclydia.”\n\nFrom my research on the wiki for *Gravity Falls*, I came to the realization that Euclydia was the name of Bill’s realm and that I would be sitting front and center and witness the destruction of the world. True to what he had alluded to, Eucyldia existed on a flat plane, as if it were just a piece of paper. In this dimension, there were no stars or cosmic bodies to speak of, with all the inhabitants of that realm bumping into each other at random and talk of any other dimensions was strictly forbidden. Everyone had two-dimensional forms befitting their environment, but I could also tell that the realm did have a sense of leadership.\n\nTwo triangles, one red, the other blue, directed the citizens with authoritative stride. Among the gathered assemblies were rhombuses and ellipses. Squares and diamonds. All the shapes you were taught in preschool were in attendance as they waited for some grand experience. What I found the most peculiar about the two triangles, however, were their two sets of eyes. If they were supposed to be Bill’s parents, then that only further indicated that Bill was born with a mutation. Just as I came to that conclusion, more cryptograms, this time representing the Caesar cipher, filled the screen.\n\nDecoding it, the symbols formed a sentence: “In aspiration of making his people see all, the killer’s mental state took a great fall.”\n\nMy eyes were directed to a yellow triangle with a single peeper rise above the others. It floated over to the farthest end of its reality when I heard the rumblings of a song. I carefully pressed the plushy cushions of my headphones to better hear what tune it was playing. It possessed a soft, motherly tone making me speculate it was Bill’s mother Scalene. I would be lying if I did not say that the lullaby lulled me into a false sense of security.\n\n“Rock-A-Bye Billy\n\nPlease don’t you cry\n\nIt’s not your fault you have that strange eye\n\nStay safe with Mommy you’ll never fall\n\nAnd we’ll always love you sharp angles and all.”\n\nThe song’s instrumentals continued to play in the background as more Cipher cryptograms glimmered. I was admittedly not too adept at decoding the cryptograms from the show, so I wrote them down and opened another tab to a website that could decode what the hidden message said. I jotted down the letters that accompanied each symbol and returned to the video. From what I could gather, it went like this.\n\n*FOR TRILLIONS OF YEARS, I WAS AFFLICTED. THEY CALLED ME CRAZY FOR SAYING THAT I SAW BILLIONS OF TRILLIONS OF UNIVERSES ALL EONS AHEAD FROM THIS FLAT HELL OF AN EXISTENCE. EVEN MY OWN MISERABLE PARENTS TRIED STUNTING MY TALENTS WITH THAT HICK OF AN EYE DOCTOR. MY EYE THROBS EVERY TIME I LOOK INTO OTHER WORLDS. I CAN’T SUPPRESS MY GIFT ANY LONGER.*\n\nI watched the yellow triangle representing Bill further push through the shapes as they went sideways and down, but never up. It pushed against the limitations of its world and stretched its hands until the palms clanged on a hollow surface. A ripple of waves wobbled on the invisible forcefield like gelatin. However, the triangle was far from done.\n\nThe vocals of the audio returned a second time, but I sensed there was something amiss about. The shape intensified its blow at the same time the song grew more pronounced. Again and again, the barrier jiggled as it became stable. The video zoomed in on the triangle’s singular eye with the slit of its pupil expanding. Galaxies sparkled being so close, yet still so far.\n\n*I WILL SHOW EVERYONE THE STARS.*\n\nA deafening smash rang through my headphones the moment Bill broke through his reality. The fabrics of reality shattered like shards of glass exposing the once concealed dimension to third dimensional space. Scalene's lullaby reached its crescendo before falling silent.\n\n*LOOK, EVERYONE! I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG! MOM, DAD, I -*\n\nThe text stopped midsentence when the video began to buffer despite playing normally. I decided to refresh the video, and it functioned properly until, yet again, it buffered on the scene. Curious, I did the same trick a few more times getting the same result, but after the sixth time, the video resumed playing a corrupted version of Scalene's lullaby.\n\n“Rock-A-Bye Billy\n\nPlease don’t you cry...\n\nIt’s not your fault you have that strange eye\n\nStay safe with Mommy, you’ll never fall\n\nAnd we’ll always love you, sharp angles and *AAALLLLLLLLLLLLL*-”\n\nThe scene slammed to show Bill’s pupil shrink as... something... descended through the crack in his reality but since the camera focused in on his face, all I heard was the sound of roaring and gnashing mandibles of a large creature. My only theory was that it was some anomaly that breached the Nightmare Realm and was now wreaking chaos on Euclydia. The once peaceful lullaby that Bill’s mother sang to him was replaced with a melody of horrified screams and the natives getting gorily ripped to shreds by the monster.\n\n*NO... NO... NO THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! OH GODS... HOW COULD THIS GO SO WRONG!!!?*\n\nBlood was everywhere as the monster ruthlessly attacked each inhabitant with no one being spared from its rage. Because of the primitive design flaw of Euclydia, it made it all the easier for their slaughter to happen en masse. Blue flames rained down from the monstrosity’s maw and engulfed buildings incinerating them to their last atom. Any that fought against the intruder did so, saving the other two-dimensional beings a few seconds at best, but their weapons were of no use. Rather, it made the monster more infuriated at their insolence.\n\nBill hovered over the ruined husk of his world his confidence being replaced with an expression of dread. His eye throbbed again this time out of bewilderment as he floated there petrified. Crimson blood splattered across his face knocking him slightly out of his catatonic state. His stomach churned with his eye burning hot with the urge to vomit (the show had confirmed that his eye doubled as his mouth). He clutched his chest with his fist as his voice staggered in disbelief. He struggled to speak, but the scent of seared flesh filled his nostrils. He could only wheeze a dry “It... it wasn’t me.”\n\nHe continued to speak into the void when the video transitioned slain Euclideans dragged their broken bodies along and linked their limbs together in huge swarms. They directed their collective gaze towards Bill... I could practically feel the venom in their words.\n\nWhy did you do it? Why did you do it?\n\nBill gripped the sides of his head in desperation of drowning the accusations out and continued doing so even when his fingernails clawed into him. The video began playing at a fast pace with Bill shaking fervently. The harsh critique drilled tiny holes in his body with his blood and tears coming together in a mixture. Cipher slowly lowered his hands.\n\nTears streaked down his eye as Bill laughed hysterically, his mental state snapping and burning away alongside the rest of his world and continued growing more erratic and pained the more Bill allowed himself to slip away. The blue flames licked his body symbolizing the punishment that he would receive for all his crimes. His mother’s lullaby reached its final note before the video abruptly ended.\n\nThe next day, I booted up my computer and decided to visit [thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com](http:\/\/thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com) to see if I could get that outcome again. I typed in “dream” as I did yesterday only to be met by the blare of the monitor as the code was rejected. No matter how many times I tried that password, I was never able to activate the link for the video. The rest of the website worked as normal."},"847":{"title":"The journal of The Reaper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1eyud6p\/the_journal_of_the_reaper\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Matter-Illustrious","selftext":"**Entry 1: The Promotion**\n\nMy name is Asher Grim, and in certain circles, I’m known as “The Reaper.” Yeah, I know—it sounds like something ripped straight out of a bad horror flick. But trust me, this is no campfire tale. What I’m about to share is the twisted journey that led me here. It all began ten years ago, on September 20th, 2016, when my life took a turn down a path I never imagined.\n\nI was 16, fresh out of high school with no real direction. Evergreen Logistics offered me a job—a simple gig moving boxes, sorting mail. It was grunt work, but it paid well enough for a kid like me with no girlfriend, no family, and a whole lot of empty time. I could afford a two-bedroom house and a decent car, which was more than most of my peers could say. But something about that place always felt... off.\n\nA year into the job, and I still hadn’t seen anyone who worked there full-time. The only person I ever encountered was Mr. Green, the man who hired me. Every Friday, he’d hand me my paycheck with a smile that seemed more like a mask than a gesture of kindness. It was a smile that never reached his eyes, like he was hiding something—something dark. The only other people I saw were the temporary workers like me, faceless, nameless, and easily forgotten.\n\nLast Friday, as usual, Mr. Green handed me my check. But this time, something strange happened. Just as I turned to leave, he spoke again, breaking his usual silence. “Good work, Asher Grim. You've done excellent work over the last year. Expect something in the mail to show our gratitude.”\n\nHis words hung in the air like a bad omen. I turned around, but Mr. Green had vanished, the only sign of his presence was the soft click of the office door closing behind him. Confused and uneasy, I brushed it off and went home, trying to shake the feeling that something was about to change.\n\nThat Sunday, as I stepped out for my morning run, I noticed an envelope sticking out of my mailbox. It bore the familiar stamp of Evergreen Logistics, and my name was scrawled across it in neat, precise handwriting. Inside was a letter that would set the course for the rest of my life:\n\n“*Dear Mr. Grim,*\n\n*We see how hard you work and want to compensate you. We are willing to offer you a promotion to agent, or you can take a lump sum of $100,000. Be assured, whichever choice you make is final; the other offer will be null and void and never obtainable again. Once you have made up your mind, please inform Mr. Green at the end of the week.*\n\n*Sincerely, Evergreen Logistics”*\n\nI stared at the letter in disbelief. A promotion? $100,000? The choice was paralyzing. The idea of stepping into a new role, an unknown role, sent shivers down my spine. But the money—oh, the money—was a temptation that clawed at my mind, promising security and freedom. I couldn’t think of anything else for days. The thought of it consumed me, and by the time Friday rolled around, I was no closer to making a decision.\n\nWhen I walked into the office that day, Mr. Green was waiting, as if he knew I’d show up. In one hand, he held a check. In the other, a name tag. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come, and reached for the name tag. Mr. Green’s lips curled into that eerie smile as he tore the check in half, the sound of ripping paper echoing in the quiet room. “Good choice, Mr. Grim,” he said, his voice as cold as a grave. “Monday will be your first day.”\n\nFor the first time in a year, I stepped beyond the confines of the storage rooms and into the heart of Evergreen Logistics. What I saw inside was something out of my worst nightmares. Creatures—grotesque, twisted beings that defied all logic—stared back at me. My scream tore through the air, a raw, primal sound that barely scratched the surface of my terror. I ran, bolting from the office and driving home as fast as my car would take me.\n\nOnce home, I slammed the door shut, bolted it, and hid in the closet with the shotgun I had never thought I’d need. My body shook with uncontrollable fear, and before I knew it, I was hyperventilating, spiraling into a full-blown panic attack. The world spun around me, the weight of my decision crushing down until I blacked out, alone in the dark.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEdit: Entry 2 is now out"},"848":{"title":"Who made this video?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1eywsv2\/who_made_this_video\/","flair":"Video","author":"SheepherderOk9241","selftext":"I found this video on YouTube today.

It's a mask you would wear for Halloween and the managers at the hospital don't really care, because all they care is that the doctors and nurses just do their jobs. So this doctor called Dr Helrik wears a red demon mask at the hospital and he treats patients like that all day and night. He even talks to his colleagues by even wearing a red demon mask, it's something that they are all accustomed to now. He is just Dr helrik who wears a red demon mask around the hospital. \n\nDr helrik is just like any other doctor around the hospital who treats patients and does his best. Patients do become wary of his red demon mask and you can tell that the patients are wondering about the red demon mask. The patients though forget about the red demon mask as they are more worried about thier illness. When Dr helrik does a good job, patients hug him and they don't care about his red demon mask, but some patients that Dr helrik has saved kind of want to see his real face. They want to see the man and the doctor that saved then. Dr helrik though doesn't show them his face. \n\nThere are occasionally some talks among patients, doctors and nurses about what Dr helrik looks like. The only time Dr helrik ever takes off his red demon mask, is when a dying patient is given more bad news and doesn't want to die. Like Mrs ulsen when she was told that there is nothing else that the doctors can do. She couldn't accept it and then Dr helrik entered the room. He told everyone to get out of Mrs ulsens room so that he could talk to her. \n\nEveryone was outside and Dr helrik had his back to them. Everyone saw Dr helrik showing his true face to Mrs ulsen by taking off his red demon mask. Then Mrs ulsen accepted her fate when Dr helrik told her that she was going to die and only had mere months to live. Then Dr helrik put on his red demon mask back on his face and walked off. Everybody was puzzled by this and whenever a patient was having a hard time dealing with bad news, Dr helrik would go up to them and take off his red demon mask and re-tell the bad news all over again and they will accept. \n\nWhen a patient didn't want a certain surgeon to operate on her, because this surgeon was really bad and had high death counts, Dr helrik took off his red mask and told the patient that crap surgeon will operate on him. The patient accepted it. \n\nWhen angry ghosts return to cause havoc upon the hospital for their failure to keep them alive, Dr helrik would simply take off his mask and he would tell the ghosts to accept that they are dead, and they do.

Rush hour was still very much alive but now in the skies. A person was late to work due to slow public transport. He was scolded by his boss. To be fair, he was in the middle-high class so he could quit his job and retire anyways because he was almost 55. His boss then gave him a shit-ton of work to do. Due to the stress that he was facing, he decided to go to one of the new space elevator parks that was open. There he was, at the line, waiting for the long line to end. When the line finally ended and he went aboard, there was only about 1 person per ride, so his family could not enjoy along. He boarded the elevator and he went up. The view was amazing though he had felt something w e i r d. First thing that he noticed that when he was riding up, he didn't see any traffic. He brushed it off thinking it was not yet rush hour. Just when he entered the clouds, then he realized, there wasn't any traffic at all. Not a single car had appeared nor any jetpack riding people. As he reached the skies now, there was no way back. On the Karman Line (the scientifically recognized boundary between the atmosphere and space), the elevator started going nuts. The elevator kept shaking and he was seeing \"hallucinations\". He kept seeing tall figures on his homeland and he randomly heard a voice come in. It said, \"01000011 01001111 01000100 01000101 00100000 01010010 01000101 01000100\". After the voice, the elevator music started to become distorted. The music ended and it was all quiet. He reached the top. He eventually came to accept his fate that his life was all fake. He entered a room that was dark with a key leading to a prison-like bar door. After he figured out to open the bar door with the key, he explored other rooms. One door led to a room called \"00110001 00111001 00110110 00111001\". He was an advanced programmer, so he knew much about UTF-8. He figured out that it said 1969, the year of the Moon landing. He entered it and went through the same elevator again. This time, something was up, it looked like what happened to his original world, but in 1969. No cars, no people, no nothing. The elevator suddenly stopped and he freaked out when he saw giant 8 foot long-nail creatures appear in front of him. They speak binary and though not very scary, they were still very intimidating. After getting arrested, he was executed an no one spoke of him again. Until, another person with the same motives as him, this time in the 2100s, entered the same ride. He fortunately escaped and went the same route as the man before him, this time, he escaped and told the whole world about the secrets. After hearing the news, the creatures decided to shut down the simulation and execute each person participating in the timeline, conscious, or not."},"853":{"title":"Eerie Echoes of Tybee Island","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1eyvoxf\/eerie_echoes_of_tybee_island\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the haunting legends of Tybee Island's ghostly tales.

The mother and daughter went mushroom picking, and at some point the mother turned away for a second and the daughter disappeared. She looked for her, called her, but everything was clear and she contacted the rescue service and the police. To say that this news alarmed our quiet and half-dead village is to say nothing! Everyone started looking for the girl: they questioned all the residents (including me and my mother), combed the entire forest, the town that was next to us, the sewers, but the child was never found. The search lasted several months until her body was found.

There’s no time to pack..  Forget your clothes, your personal belongings - forget me! You have to go right now and not say a word for fear that they will hear you and make you both victims of their unnatural torment.  I will ramble loudly to keep them focused on me while you make your escape.*  With tears streaming down my face, I push them out of our disfigured door.  My last words to them are, *I love you both.  Don’t ever come back.*  I never see my family again.\n\nIt all started last year when I was still employed at All American Collection Agency.  I was a worker bee in a honeycomb of cubicles on the fifth floor of building Three making my hundredth phone call of the day. I don’t remember the  name on the delinquent account I was calling, how much he or she owed, if I was going to play the aggressive, threatening bill collector or the sympathetic and understanding financial appropriator. What I do remember is hearing the clicking sound for the first time in my headset while the other end of the line was still ringing.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nI knew what it meant right away. A third party was listening in on my line before the second party that I was calling even answered the phone. The way our calling system worked was designed for maximum calls per hour. As soon as I would hang up with one call, the automatic dialing program would immediately call the next account. It was in the short span of three, maybe four seconds in between calls that I heard the strange, digital clicking sound in my ear phones. Someone answered the phone and said hello repeatedly as I sat in silence, listening for those who were listening on me. Eventually the person I called hung up and again, in that short span of time between roto-calls is when I confirmed hearing it.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nBy the time the next recipient answered my call I had already hung up and got to work on my computer. I paused the automatic calling system and then turned up the volume on my head set. There was no ringing or dial tone to be heard. Just silence. I listened for what seemed forever to the nothingness in my ears when I finally heard their presence again.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\n*Hello,* I spoke into the vast quiet.  *Is anyone there?* For a long time after that, I secretly watched my coworkers work the phones and move about the office as I sat motionless, listening to them listening to me.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nLunch time arrived and I decided to skip the usual routine of walking to Building Five and eating generic shit they sell in the company cafeteria. No, I decided to speak with the floor manager about this situation right away. He never ate with the rest of us, always bringing a lunch with him so I knew he would be in his office. I knocked on the door and saw him wave me in through the window. I sat down and got to the point right away.\n\n*Tom,* I said, *Are you monitoring my calls?* He looked at me funny and said that one of his many responsibilities is to check on our calls periodically throughout the day. But “No,” he said, “I haven’t checked in on your line at all today.” Now it was my turn to give him a funny look as I said *Well Tom, someone is listening in on my calls.  If it’s not you, then who would it be?*  Tom assured me that no one else would have the authority or the capability to be monitoring my calls. It was either himself or no one at all. At the time, I didn’t believe him. I smirked and replied, *Okay Tom, whatever.  If you won’t admit it, then that’s your problem, not mine.*  I got up and walked out thinking that would be the end of it.  Isn’t that how it goes sometimes?  Something small happens. We think of it as nothing more than a nuisance, not understanding until it’s too late that we have already entered the beginning of our worst nightmare.\n\nThat evening I brought up the matter to my wife during dinner while she was simultaneously eating and fidgeting with the ribbon in her hair. My wife had a thing for wearing colorful ribbons. They  made her short hair more pretty to look at and tonight she wore her yellow ribbon. As soon as I mentioned my ordeal at work she stopped fidgeting and stared at me in contemplation. Jesse hadn’t had his tenth birthday yet so he didn’t understand or care to understand the topic of discussion. The blessings of being too young to know life is full of bullshit. Alicia however, took the matter seriously but in the wrong context. “Are you still taking your medication,” she asked me. *Yes dear,* I reply, rolling my eyes. *This has nothing to do with my medication. This is about something real, not in my head.* I explain to her that this is a violation of my rights.  If the company I’ve been working for the last thirteen years wants to deny that they are spying on my calls, then it’s a matter of breaking my trust in them. Loyalty shouldn’t be disregarded so easily and I have never been reprimanded not once since my altercation with that asshole at the snack machine in building Two, three years ago. As part of my probationary period with the company, I was forced to see the doctor I have now who diagnosed  me and prescribes my medication.\n\nNow that I brought him up, I do want to make it clear that although the incident led to me being diagnosed with slight schizophrenia, the truth of the matter is that the asshole I punched was indeed, fucking with the company snack machine in a manner that prevented me from getting the only candy bar I liked to eat. Although I wasn’t able to prove it, the fact remains that he rigged the machine so that my candy bars would get stuck in the circular rings during the dispensing process, preventing my would-be snack from falling down into the hand slot where I could retrieve them. I was never able to prove how he did it, but believe me, it was no coincidence that he would be behind me every time I was on break and walked to the only building that had the snack machine with my particular candy bar as an option. Nor was it a coincidence that he was there to laugh at me everytime my candy bar would get stuck, stealing my money, wasting my time and leaving me feeling unsatisfied and rejected. I will conclude speaking on this side topic by admitting to you that punching that asshole square in the nose was far more satisfying than any candy bar I have ever eaten. Needless to say, I finished dinner with my family feeling unsatisfied and rejected because of my wifes reaction to my situation. That night was the first of many that I didn’t sleep a wink.\n\nThe rest of the work week did nothing to ease my sleepless nights.  I caught them listening to my calls from the moment I put my headset on at the start of each shift until I took them off at closing time.\n\nCLICK - CLICK. \n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nBy Friday, I was speaking directly to them while the auto-dialing system was reaching out to my next caller. *Hey, thanks for tuning in,* I would say, *Been a real pleasure to have you assholes keeping me company all day. I just want you to know that you are the garbage of the universe and your mothers are the whores of all non-creation.* Ha. If they weren’t going to admit listening on my calls then I was going to enjoy insulting them every chance I got. *Your fathers are the salesmen of anti-purpose and your children are horrible little bigots.* Sometimes I barely finished my insults before someone would answer my call, but I made sure that those who listen got an ear full of sufficient insults.\n\nTwenty minutes before the work week ended I was back in Tom's office, but this time it was he who wanted to speak with me in private.  He called me to his office and I obliged, feeling righteous in my verbal assaults to the secret listeners.  Keep in mind, I still thought it was the company that was listening. By this point, I was half right. “I’ve been listening in on your line,” Tom said, “ and frankly, I’m more concerned with your behavior in between calls then I am with what you’re saying on calls. Can you explain to me who it is you think you are speaking to in such a vulgar and sometimes violent manner?” At the time I felt a wave of redemption flow over me as I responded, *Oh, so you admit that you lied to me before and you are indeed listening to my calls?* I didn’t see where this was going when he responded, “So let me get this straight…when you said ‘I’m gonna bash your families heads in with a baseball bat,’ you were explicitly speaking to me and threatening my wife and two girls with violence?”\n\nNow, I don’t remember making that particular threat, but keep in mind, I make over a hundred calls a day and in between those calls I try to hurl as many insults as possible before the line answered.  I try to be creative in terms of insults and threats to keep them from being immune to my verbal attacks. I thought variety would help shake their resolve.\n\n“Answer me. Were you specifically threatening my family?” he asked with fire in his eyes as I started to consider for the first time that maybe it wasn’t my employers after all.  But then I heard the familiar sound omit from somewhere in his office.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nI froze, like a statue. He stared at me while I stood there motionless.  Even when he asked me if I was okay, I stayed motionless while I listened.  And sure enough -\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\n*You dishonest son of a bitch,* I said, *By law, you are supposed to inform an employee when you are recording a conversation with them in your office.* He tried to say he wasn’t recording but I wasn’t buying it.  In fact, I was so angry that I really can’t remember what I said, but it prompted him to pick up the phone and call security. It all happened so fast that I didn’t even protest as two security guards arrived and escorted me out of building Three and walked me all the way to my car,  parked in Lot B.  They even stood there and watched as I pulled out of parking space A21.  I stop the car and roll down the window. \n\n*Hey, I have something that belongs to Tom - belongs to the company really.  Should I come back later to drop it off or do you want to give it to him?* I ask the guards.  The smaller guard with the bigger mustache says he’ll take it and walks over to my car.  I reach over to the passenger seat with my left hand and close it, then bring my fist back and extend my arm out the window.  I raise my middle finger right in the guards mustache face and drive off.  And that’s how they who listen got me fired from my job.\n\nMy wife was none too happy about the situation as we talked later that night in our bedroom. Alicia took out the pink ribbon from her hair and slammed her fist on the bedside table, startling me with her aggressive response. She insisted that I go see my doctor to get a mental evaluation. The words she used hurt my feelings and in doing so, I felt too deflated to argue with her. I simply agreed and we went to bed with our backs to each other and a pillow between us. \n\nThe next day I saw Dr. Goodleef at his office in town. It was a short drive there and a short wait in his lobby. When I was called back to his office however, my time there seemed to stretch out as he asked me a zillion repetitive questions with the same themes and unspoken accusations. Why did something have to be wrong with me? It’s as if the doctor believed that once you start taking medication for something, then all future problems in the world become your fault automatically without the possibility of there being something wrong with anyone else’s behavior.  I found his entire line of questioning to be demeaning but I can’t say I didn’t like him.  He seemed to really care about me and that kind of felt nice.  I played along for what seemed like the longest doctor's visit in my life until he finished our session by telling me he was going to prescribe new medication. *Does this mean I’ll be taking the old and the new pills,* I asked him. “No,” he replied, “You will only have to take the new pills.” But instead of taking pills twice a day, he instructed me to start off taking the new ones three times a day, at least until they worked their way into my system.  I agreed and left his office cheerful because I was happy to get out of there.  And sure, I would do as he instructed and start taking the new meds that evening and I liked him but I was not going to let him fool me into thinking that I was the problem.\n\nAlicia demanded that I find a new job asap, so I hopped on the computer with full intention of searching for one, but first I wanted to conduct a little research about my situation.  Despite getting fired, I wasn’t sure that it was my job behind the phone spying because I was such an amazing employee that it’s hard to believe that any employer would want me gone.  That must be why things went so bad, because they weren’t behind it.  But who was?  To figure that out, I figured I better educate myself on the topic first.  I spent days - or was it weeks - on the computer, discovering the horrors of privacy violations that are allowed to occur in today’s society. Did you know that wiretapping has been around as long as the 1890’s, shortly after the invention of the phone recorder? Neither did I. That’s eighty years before the invention of personal computers.  This means that they’ve had over one hundred and twenty some years to perfect listening devices.  My God, I was floored at the thought of how advanced listening technology must be today. I had to learn more.\n\nTo say that Alicia was indifferent to my research is an understatement. Thankfully I only had to put up with her in the evenings during the week but man oh man, come the weekends I found her nagging about jobs and bills nearly intolerable. That’s when I started sleeping on the couch so I could continue my research without her insufferable bickering. I put the t.v. in Jesse’s room so he could continue watching his favorite programs, giving me the quiet I required while I studied. Occasionally we would eat dinner together as a family and I would share my knowledge with them. When I told them that the Government admittedly records all digital communications of everyone in America, my wife scoffed and replied that everyone knew that. *Oh yea,* I said, *I bet you and everyone else thinks that eventually your conversations are eventually deleted or discarded. But in truth, recorded digital conversations are never really destroyed. They become forever part of a global collection of conversations kept amongst foreign governments and technological companies in an effort to advance consumer marketing strategies based on our overall thinking patterns.*  Alicia continued to act as though this was old news. Jesse was spaced out, not interested and chewing with his mouth open while his mother acted like a know-it-all. They were both pissing me off.\n\nI agreed with her that everyone knows the same generic stuff about phone surveillance but was she aware that anyone can purchase wire tapping kits online and at certain electronic stores?  If some mysterious person or unlawful group of people wanted to tap your phone lines then you would most likely never know about it - ever!  When she replied “God, you sound paranoid,” I slammed my fist down on the table, bouncing our plates and food in the air and knocking over her wine glass. Now they were paying attention. But now I didn’t feel like talking anymore so I stormed out of the apartment to get some air.\n\nOur apartment was in the back of the building so I had to walk past two more residences along the walkway to the parking lot.  I reached our car and stood next to it as I surveyed the lot. It was full of vehicles and there were some residents around, walking their dogs and talking outside. And of course there was the white RV parked in the same damn spot it’s been in for God knows how many years now.  I’ve never seen anyone go in it or do anything to it. It’s just been sitting there taking up space and getting shittier looking each year.\n\nThen I looked at my building. The wooden walkway extended ten feet or so into the lot and continued down the hall and stairwell. On the outside, just below the roof along the top floor, there’s a large circular sculpture nailed into the bricks. It’s supposed to be artistic I suppose and make the complex look more classy, but I find the circular design to be an eye-sore.  And the land on which the parking lot is built seemed to bend further at an angle then I remember.  That’s when I noticed a guy and girl standing in the back of the parking lot. They were watching me. I mean, from a quick glance, they seemed to be having a serious discussion but after observing them for awhile, I caught them sneaking peeks at me. Then I looked all around me and noticed quite a few people sitting in their cars, pretending to be on their cell phones and other folks walking around the apartment complex, pretending to not spy on me. I caught them all watching me with quick glances and over the shoulder looks and some of the more brazen ones just stared directly at me.  That was it. I was exposed, like a nerve. Out in the open and vulnerable. I quickly walked back to my unit. Everyone outside watched me go back inside. I locked the front door and sat down at my computer. My wife and son were somewhere further in the apartment and I didn’t care where. I logged online and continued my research.\n\nI don’t know how much time had passed, weeks or months, but I stopped eating with my family because I couldn’t take their disinterest in my work nor did I care to sacrifice unnecessary time away from the computer as I studied the ability and capabilities of listening.  My God, the advanced complexities of technology and biology pertaining to what, how and why we hear surpass anything I could have imagined possible.  Did you know that the endocochlear potential of your inner ears produces electrochemical energy?  That’s right, your ears produce energy called biological electrical currents that are strong enough to power small electronics.  I bet you didn’t know that your sense of hearing completely relies on tiny hairs deep inside your ears. If these hairs get damaged, then you lose your hearing.  And there’s no way that you knew that your ears never stop growing. That’s right. Ear skin grows approximately one point three inches per year. We shed our old skin constantly and thank goodness because if we didn’t, our ears would be as large as frisbees by the time we reached our fifties.\n\nI could go on and on about the human ear but right now I want to tell you about the last day I spent with my family.  I was at my work station, studying rarefactions of longitudinal air waves creating sound when it occurred to me that I wasn’t alone. I looked away from my computer to find my wife standing there in silence, watching me.\n\nNormally I’d be furious at her for spying on me as I had caught her doing so several times recently. And on each of those occasions I had made it abundantly clear that I hated when she did it, so I was surprised to find her doing it again. But there was something sad about  the way she was looking at me and I felt something I hadn’t for a long time - compassion. I asked her what was wrong and she explained that her and Jesse needed me today. Jesse had a dentist appointment and she couldn’t get the day off. She could only get half a day and had to go in on time. She wanted me to drop her off and take Jesse to the dentist office. Afterwards, she’d be done her half day and we could come get her and spend the rest of the day together. She said she knew that I hadn’t left our apartment in quite some time and that it was a lot to ask of me but if we postponed his dentist appointment it could be months before he’d get a rescheduled date. And he really needs these braces. I agreed and she seemed incredibly thankful.\n\nI admit, the sunlight was blinding and I had to squint my eyes on our walk to the car. My eyes had become so unaccustomed to the daylight that I couldn’t really see my surroundings until we got halfway to her job. I was relieved to finally be able to see safely as my wife pulled in front of her building and kissed both Jesse and I before going in. Even though her kiss was very quick, it was still warm and felt good on my lips. I got behind the wheel and drove the short distance to the dentist office.\n\nWe registered at the front office and took seats in the large waiting room. Everything was going so well that I actually felt jubilant. My wife and I had sparked the smallest but deeply impactful connection between us that I’ve missed more than I realized. It was good to feel as though she cared about me. It was good looking in her eyes and not seeing hatred. It’s good now, I thought as I sat next to my son whom I successfully drove there. What a great job I’m doing being a father. A husband. A family man again. And to cap it off, the dentist walks in and introduces himself to me and sticks out his hand. I stood up proudly and shook it in front of everyone in the room, including my son. The nice dentist explained how he was going to put braces on Jesse’s front teeth and I said “Okay. Take good care of him now,” and off he went with my son in tow. I sat down and let the emotions run over me. Happiness. Pride. Love.\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nMy heart skips a beat and I sit there in complete silence. There is an older couple sitting in chairs to my left. Both of them pretend to read magazines but I can see that they are staring at me from under their glasses. There is a large woman sitting across from me and she is pretending to rest her eyes with her head back as she pretends to wait for someone. She has a huge adam’s apple, round as a golf ball.  I can see that her eyes are open just a crack, watching me. The two ladies who work for the dentist are beyond obvious in the way that they keep staring at me while moving about the office. Then it hits me that this appointment was made a long time ago. Quite a long time for them to plot and plan and set things up. Who knows what they can do when you tell them exactly where and when you’ll be someplace. But how did they know I’d be here? I haven’t left home in such a long time. How did they know I was going to be that great of a father to bring him here?\n\nCLICK - CLICK.\n\nThat’s it!  I stand up and stare down everyone around me, nodding my head up and down with a defiant look on my face that says ‘I’m not playing this fucking game.’\n\n“Do you have a problem,” asks the large woman with the round adam’s apple. I look her in the eyes and scoff. But then, the strangest thing happened. Her large, round adam’s apple blinked. That’s the only way to describe it. It was as if a large, third eye bulged out of the woman’s neck and it could see me through her skin. It watched me like they all watch me and then I saw it blink again under her loose flesh. I pointed at the blinking adam’s apple and screamed. After that, no one pretended to not be staring at me as I ran out of there. I hurried back to our car, got inside and sat there in complete silence.  I didn’t make a sound as I breathed and I didn’t move a muscle even though the position I was sitting in was very uncomfortable as my butt was on the buckle of my seatbelt.  I ignored the discomfort and just sat there and thought about how much I loved my son and wife. I feared how awful it’s going to be for them if they become targets like me.  I couldn’t bear to see that happen.  I love them too much.  And then I realized I wasn’t motionless anymore. I was crying.\n\nBy the time my son found me in the car where we parked, he had a new set of shiny braces under his worried brow and I had tears streaming down my cheeks. Clearly someone had said something to make him look so worrisome as he stared at me. I have to admit that I turned away from looking at him because the glare that the sun reflected off of his braces was too bright for my watery eyes. I couldn’t look at him as I told him to get in. The car ride back to Alicia’s job was not so good. My jovial mood was replaced with dread and the sound of both Jesse and me crying side by side was none too pleasant a backdrop for happy bonding. I wanted to put the radio on but it seemed rude so I went with father and son balling in the front seats vibe. Not a pleasant sound. But still better than the strange, digital sound of clicking which I thankfully hadn’t heard in our car. Yet. Maybe they were going to bug our car while I sat in the waiting room of the dentist but I foiled their plan by returning to the car early.\n\nThis was something serious to think about as I arrived at Alicia’s job. She came out of the building and hurried over to us when she saw us crying. She went to Jesse’s side of the car first and opened his door. She pulled him out and hugged him. I got out and she put Jesse back in the passenger seat and then she nearly threw me in the back seat. I plopped down in the back seat and the car door hit my foot as Alicia shut it. She hopped in the driver’s seat and took off. It’s one thing to take the wheel from someone. It’s another to make a person feel like they’ve been car jacked. I slid across the back seat as Alicia drove frantically across town, listening to Jesse explain what the dentist’s staff told him happened. On top of that, he said his face hurt like Hell, despite the novacain.  I thought the ride to pick up my wife sucked but that was nothing compared to the awful state of being that was my life on the way back from picking up my wife. This time, had I been in the front seat, I surely would of turned on the radio to tune out the sound of the three of us crying in terrible unison.  The ride sucked so bad that I didn’t even notice where we were until she parked in the lot of my doctors office.\n\nSitting alone in Doctor Goodleefs office, wearing just my underwear, I listened intently for the tell-all familiar sound of the you-know-what. As far as I could tell, they hadn’t gotten to him yet.  But if they prepared for me at the dentist then they may have prepared for me at the doctors, right?  As my suspicions grew, the door opened and I could see in my doctors face that he is definitely not with them or anyone that’s out to harm me. I saw genuine shock and concern in the man’s face as he closes the door and tells me how awful I look. He tells me I must have lost nearly sixty to eighty pounds since he saw me last and says my eyes look glossy and my hair has thinned out significantly. The poor guy - if he wasn’t a doctor, I’d call him a doctor. That’s how bad he looked when he examined me. He wanted to know if I’ve been taking the pills and yes I told him that I take the pills twice a day and then he stops me there and says that’s impossible.  The amount he gave me would of ran out over a month ago. Plus my wife told him that I ran through the pills in a week which means it’s been months since I’ve taken anything.  Now I wasn’t paying no mind to what he was saying because I knew what was what and what wasn’t. I just played along because I felt bad for the guy. He genuinely seemed to be a nice human being who cares about helping people and the poor schlub with a doctors license and several PHD’s was face to face with a hard lesson - that some patients are fucked by life.  That’s it, plain and simple.  Some of us are fucked by life and no medicine, exercise, cures, prayers or a good fucking diet can do anything about it.\n\nBut like I said, I play along. He gives me a few shots and gives me some pills to take. He watches me take them.   I dress and my wife and son come in.  The doc prescribes me more meds and insists that my wife do the driving for the family until I’m better. I agree. He tells my wife to bring me back in two days so that he can do an extensive check of my health, physically and mentally.  We agree and leave.   Shame I’ll never see him again. I hope he has a successful career filled with more patients that he can help then patients fucked by life. I’m truly rooting for him.\n\nThe ride back home was fantastic. I found a great rock station on the radio and kept the volume cranked as I sang classics like “Midnight Special” from CCR and “Paradise By The Dashboard Light” by Meatloaf.  I was self aware enough to know that the drugs my sympathetic doctor gave me were making me feel high and instead of feeling guilty about it, I gave in to the rush of adrenaline.  I sang loud and proud while taking notice of how everything blurred together outside my window during the trip. It was a beautiful mixture of music and motion as the world visually spun out of context.  And then everything stopped.  Parked in the lot of our apartment complex, my happy disposition turned into pure dread when I saw what they had done.\n\nI stumbled out of the car in disbelief at not only how much had changed but at the unfathomable scope of their capabilities. The lot was full of cars that were parked in a mouth shape of metallic teeth. Even our car had somehow merged with the two rows of vehicles that closed the gap at the corners.  The large RV was there of course, but now it’s steel frame blurred with flesh, creating a massive nose. The front seats were visible through the twisted medal holes that formed the nostrils. I could see seats inside. They were black and have changed into large nose hairs. Above the nose, adjacent to the large, skin colored building was the oval art structure that has turned into a great big eye. The bricks that form the entrance to my apartment were melded with flesh into a pinna, which is the outer part of the earlobe.\n\nAlicia and Jesse got out of the car and looked as worried as I did. That’s when all of the vehicles roared to life.  I looked up and saw the great eye blink twice as it stared at my family, roaring with all of the engines at full throttle.  The vehicles began to move on their own, opening wide all around us.  Then the jaws started to close and the cars were crashing together at the ends.  It’s do or die time. I grabbed my son firmly by the hand right before Alicia got hold of his other one and I started to run.  At first my wife tried to pull us back the other way but thankfully I had a tight grip on Jesse so I was able to yank the two of them around the closing fangs and out of the great mouth as all of the vehicles smashed loudly together. We ran toward the RV nose and around its large nostrils. I glanced inside and saw a human sized insect with six white eyes looking back at me from the darkness within.  I looked back up and saw the great eye glaring down at us as we ran under it and entered the outer layer of the great ear.\n\nWe moved through the tunnel made of wood, brick and flesh that have blurred together to make the ear canal. Several times my son almost trips and falls but I managed to keep him upright by holding his arm up high as we went. We passed the stairwell which had transformed into the giant ear drum that was curvy and several floors tall.\n\nWe finally reach the Tympanic membrane and the orange walls that made up our doorway were contorted in a circular fashion.  I use my free hand to take out the house key from my pocket and plunge it in the keyhole, praying that our door will still open in its current, twisted state.  It opens. A second of relief hits me as I shove my family inside and enter behind them.  A second of relief is all I got as we stood in what used to be the foyer of our apartment that has now been transformed into the strange, lumpy shape of the Ossicular chain within the inner ear.  I didn’t even close the door behind me as I quickly ascertained that I had made a terrible mistake in bringing my family home.\n\nI have been fighting the inevitable for a long time and it’s game over. They win.  I lose.  But it’s not too late for Alicia and Jesse.  Either I take them down with me or I cut them free.  If they leave now and avoid the great mouth outside then they can make it.  I can cause a distraction to give them cover.  I make the selfless decision to save them as I release Jesse’s hand and lean in close to Alicia.\n\n*They are listening,* I whisper, knowing it would be the last time I will ever speak to my wife. *Don’t say a word.  Take Jesse and get out of here.  Don’t tell me where you’re going. There’s no time to pack.  Forget your clothes, your personal belongings - forget me!  You have to go right now and not say a word for fear that they will hear you and make you both victims of their unnatural torment.  I will ramble loudly to keep them focused on me while you make your escape.*  With tears streaming down my face I push them out of our disfigured door.  My last words to them are, *I love you both.  Don’t ever come back.*\n\nThe door closes.  My family is gone.  Forever.  A wave of emotions hit me and I use them to cause the mother of all distractions.  I start yelling and destroy everything I can with my bare hands.  Anything that wasn’t blurred with the inner ear fell victim to my wrath.  I threw things.  Kicked and punched lamps and tables.  Yanked all the wires out of the walls.  Eventually, I find a hammer and use it on all of the electronic items I can find while singing the last lyrics to Meatloaf’s “Paradise By The Dashboard Light.”  My computer, cell phone, the microwave, refrigerator, the television in Jesse’s room - I smashed them all to pieces while repeating loudly, *It was long ago and it was far away and it was so much better that it was today.  It was long ago and it was far away and it was so much better that it was today….*  I sang until my voice cracked and I smashed until my muscles gave up.  And after making all that noise, I went silent.\n\nGod knows how long ago that was.  Years?  Decades?  Time stretches and bends like the confines of this organic listening device that is my prison.  I keep the hammer I found with me at all times as I survive without food, water or contact with the outside world.  Outside - Ha!  The last time I was able to lift a window curtain up and peek outside, I was horrified to see that the trees out back have turned into giant hair follicles on the great head.  I even saw several giant sized Lice, nearly as big as myself,  moving around the massive hairs.  The creatures moved in and out of the tall hairs, watching me until I closed the curtain.  I never saw outside again as the curtain eventually blended with the ear walls and just like the front door, I was no longer able to open them because of their contorted shapes. The kitchen sink, fridge and cabinets eventually blurred with the spiral shape of the inner ear as did the bathroom toilet, shower and sink, leaving me without water and food.  Time blurs into eternity. I don’t know what has kept me alive for so long as I exist naked, dirty, hungry, thirsty and clinging to this hammer as if it’s my last grasp on sanity itself.  Maybe it’s the act of being quiet that has kept me alive for so long.\n\nAnd then I hear the sound of something cracking along the Ossicular chain.  Sounds like it’s being ripped open.  Then I hear thumps on the floor as if something has entered from outside.  As I lay motionless, tucked in between the flaps of the sofa and wall that have merged together, I listen to an awful screeching sound come from the Ossicular chain.  The screeching stops and then a shuffling sound makes its way passed my hiding place within the outer Cochlea and moves on.  Clenching the hammer to my chest, I slowly unfold out of the ear crevice and ever so quietly walk deeper within the spiral labyrinth of the Cochlea, which is shaped like a shell, until I reach its center.  I step inside what used to be Jesse’s room and now serves as the heart of the great ear with all of its magnificent purple, pink and blue bone walls.  I shiver at the sight of what stands before me - two human sized ear mites, ripping apart the structure of the inner ear and stuffing the torn parts into a suitcase-like bag. The Otedectic Mites are big insects with hideous mouths and multiple appendages snapping like crab claws.  One of the grotesque creatures is as tall as I am with a yellow ribbon wrapped around its antenna. The other foul insect is half my size with shiny metal fangs in its leathery mouth.  I hear the terrible screeching again, coming from their mouths as they communicate with each other before trying to intimidate me in their unintelligible dialect.   It’s do or die time.  I raise my hammer high.  *CLICK - CLICK,*  I say, being the origin of vibrational sound that’s interpreted by the construct of the great ear.  I swing my hammer down upon them continuously, as I repeat  myself over and over.\n\n*CLICK - CLICK.*\n\n*CLICK  - CLICK.*\n\n*CLICK - CLICK.*                                                                                                               "},"863":{"title":"SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode: RUN","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ey989l\/spongebob_squarepants_lost_episode_run\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Hunterbeast47","selftext":"Who doesn't know about the show SpongeBob SquarePants? It's one of if not the most popular pieces of animation in history. How the late Stephen Hillenburg was able to share his vision with his love for the sea is incredible. However, it wasn't all swell. If anyone knows about the history of the show, Hillenburg intended to end the series after the first movie, and he didn't even want to make the movie at first. Despite his show's success Nickelodeon wanted more. To this day, the greedy company is still disrespecting the legacy of Hillenburg and his show by making it a cash cow.\n\n   It's not only pathetic but it's scary. Not for what you might think. It was a situation that involved Hillenburg and the company a little bit after the first SpongeBob movie. I was a witness to it. Late one night in December 2004, I was watching \"Nick and Night\" because at the time \"Friends\" ended and I wanted to catch up on reruns. It was now 1am and what came on next was \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\". I was confused and excited at the same time. This movie was still in theatres at this moment, but I assumed it was a treat by the network for watching their late programs since nobody likes to stay up late. The movie was normal, and nothing went wrong. I thought it was a steal that I didn't have to pay to watch this movie. The movie ended near 3am but there was still 15 minutes left until the next episode of Friends came on. I assumed they would air a random episode of SpongeBob to fit the run time. I was unfortunately right. Once the credits to the movie concluded, it totally skipped the intro to the show and presented the title card simply named \"RUN\" in all caps. The creators named popped on screen, but there was no bubble transition to start the episode. It began at night showing the Pineapple (SpongeBob's House), the Easter Island Statue (Squidward's House), and the big rock (Patrick's House) in one frame. There was no moon, no stars, and not even those flower skies too. Looking at that void was really .... unnerving.\n\n   Next it showed a wide-awake SpongeBob sitting on his bed with a creepy smile look to his face. He didn't have any eyelashes, and his nose was a little bigger than usual. SpongeBob looked toward his pet snail \"Gary\". The poor thing was sleeping peacefully. It had no idea what he was about to endure. SpongeBob grabbed the shell and begun to twist it sideways slowly and painfully. Gary started to scream and meow in pain. Once the shell was turned 360 degrees it popped out of Gary, which showed his disgusting insides. SpongeBob picked Gary and put him back into the shell. He placed the shell upside down so he wouldn't escape and started shaking salt onto the snail for a solid minute. I was disgusted with this scene because I had a pet hamster at the time, and I cannot stand animal abuse. Why would SpongeBob savagely torture his beloved pet to death? After that horrible scene, SpongeBob left his house and began toward Squidward's house. Realizing he wasn't home and probably at the Krusty Krab he decided to get him later.\n\n   Inside Patrick's house was Patrick sleeping on his sand couch. SpongeBob slithered over to him. It was weird, SpongeBob looked taller now especially to Patrick's size. What caught me off guard was when SpongeBob pointed to his eyes and said in a deep tone \"no eyelashes'. What was he going to do to his best friend Patrick? A pair of scissors appeared on SpongeBob's hands as he grabbed Patrick's left eyelid and cut it right off. The pink idiot didn't wake up to the pain until the second eyelid was cut off. It was too late because soon the scissors were gauging both his eyes out. Patrick let off a final scream yelling, \"Help SpongeBob!\" before collapsing, Oblivious that his best friend was the one who did this. Next was a montage of SpongeBob killing off all his friends. SpongeBob found Sandy's house and destroyed the dome glass causing her to drown. Pearl was kidnapped and taped around the mouth. SpongeBob covered her blowhole with chum causing her to suffocate. SpongeBob tore off Plankton's antennas and chewed and swallowed him like bubble gum. Finally, Mrs. Puff was chased by a boat driven by SpongeBob and ran over.\n\n   There was a bubble transition after the montage showing the Krusty Krab. No customers were in there as they probably all dead. Squidward was sitting at the cash register playing his clarinet. A quick deep SpongeBob laughter played for a second which stopped Squidward to look around. Slightly unnerved, Squidward continued playing. The lights cut off and when they returned the clarinet was gone. Squidward had no time to be angry because SpongeBob immediately shoved the whole instrument down his throat. This scene really creeped me out because it reminded me of that one episode \"Squidward in Clarinet Land\", where Squidward witnessed his mirror counterpart do the same thing. Squidward choked violently and turned dark blue with foam around his mouth. Lastly, it showed Mr. Krabs counting his money. \" Arghahahaha\" Mr. Krabs laughed. \"I should beat up more kids in Bikini Bottom to collect their money\". The laughing ended after the lights cut off for good. \"SQUIDWARD! CHECK THE ELECTRIC BOX\". yelled Mr. Krabs. No response. Quite annoyed Mr. Krabs walked out of his office and into the dining area. Krabs shined his flashlight and toward the register to find... a decapitated Squidward with all his tentacles cut off and sticking out the cash register. The clarinet was jammed into Squidward's head. Mr. Krabs said he was going to be sick and then heard the deep SpongeBob laughter. Terrified, Mr. Krabs ran back into his office and hid into his shell. SpongeBob broke into the shell and dumped a pile of Nematodes that began to decompose the exposed Crab meat. The episode ended showing the Nematodes multiply and filling out of Mr. Krabs Shell. \n\n  What the hell was that?! That had to be the most disgusting episode I've ever watched, and I watched \"The Splinter and Fungus Among Us\". I never really looked at SpongeBob the same anymore. Several years later in around 2010, I was able to message Hillenburg about the episode I watched, and he surprisingly replied fast. \" Oh boy that episode\" started Hillenburg. \"Let this be known that it was not intentional to go on the air and I don't know how it did for you\". \"Originally, I was going to show this to the experts at Nick as a middle finger for wanting so much of my creation\" \"That was the plan if the movie failed, but it didn't, so me and my team never went on with showing it\". \"I didn't know the creation was still at Nickelodeon and I never thought it would ever air, but that's Nick for you. I'm really sorry you had to watch\" \"The whole point of the episode was a nutshell on how Nick treated my show, basically killing it. I don't remember all the gory scenes you're telling me however\" \"All that happens is SpongeBob cusses everyone out and is a jerk and quits his job and works at the Chum Bucket\". \"My best assumption is that some of my crazy developers may have tampered with the animation\". \"Not sure whom considering they have long left the team after the movie\". \"Keep in touch buddy and let me know how you're feeling\".\n\n"},"864":{"title":"I Can Count To 10 ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exwlsg\/i_can_count_to_10\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"I Can Count to 10\n\nEvery night, it’s always the same: I get a bedtime story, a goodnight kiss, and then Mom and Dad leave me to sleep. But tonight, things feel different. They didn’t follow the routine.\n\nLying in bed, I felt super nervous. My tummy felt all twisty, and I needed to think about something else. My room was dark, but my nightlight was on, glowing softly. My stuffed animal, a cute little piggy my big brother gave me before he moved out, was snuggled next to me. He taught me how to count to ten because I’m ten, and counting always made me feel better.\n\nI looked around and spotted the remote on my dresser. I had an idea! I reached for it and pressed the button to turn on the TV. Yay! My favorite show, *Peppa Pig,* popped up right away!\n\nOn the screen, Peppa and her friends were in the backyard playing a counting game with Daddy Pig. “Alright, everyone,” he said, sounding all cheerful, “let’s count to ten while we jump!”\n\nPeppa giggled, and her friends joined in. “One!” they all shouted while jumping high. “Two! Three! Four!” They bounced higher, their laughter filling the screen, and it made me giggle, too.\n\nWhen they reached “Ten!” the camera zoomed in on Peppa’s happy face. “Let’s do it again!” she squealed. But then, something weird happened—the screen flickered for a moment, and the sound went all funny, like an old tape getting messed up.\n\nI tried to shake it off and focus on the happy scene, but that little moment gave me the creeps.\n\nSuddenly, I heard soft noises outside, like footsteps on the grass. My heart jumped! I listened harder and thought I heard a snort, like Peppa Pig’s. I turned down the TV, trying to catch the sound. Was I scared? Or was it some kind of magic? Could Peppa Pig really be out there?\n\nI pressed my ear to the floor, holding my breath. *Thump, thump, thump.* A low snort followed, then a sniff, long and slow. *Thump, thump.* The noises got louder. *Oink… oink…* My skin prickled, and then I heard a loud, high-pitched screech.\n\nPanic shot through me! I dove under my bed, clutching my Peppa Pig stuffed animal tight against my chest. My heart thudded in my ears as the sounds got closer. *Thump, thump, thump, thump.* Each step made me feel more scared.\n\nThen, I heard it a door creaking open slowly, the familiar squeak of my bedroom door. My parents screamed suddenly, their voices full of shock. “Ahhhhh! What the hell!?” my dad yelled.\n\nMom screamed, too. “AAAHHHH!” But then everything went quiet. I listened hard, and I heard the TV playing its theme song, like it always does:\n\nPeppa Pig: \"I’m Peppa Pig!\"  \nPeppa Pig: \"This is my little brother, George!\"  \nGeorge: *oinks*  \nPeppa Pig: \"This is Mummy Pig!\"  \nMummy Pig: *oinks*\n\nThe song made my stomach feel weird because of everything happening.\n\nThen I heard heavy footsteps really big ones. *Thud, bump.* *Oink, oink, sniff, sniff.* My chest got tight with fear.\n\nIn my panic, I accidentally pressed the button on my stuffed animal that made it talk. “Let’s learn to count to ten!” it chirped. My heart sank as it started counting. “One… Two… Three…” Each number felt like a loud drum banging in my chest. I tried to cover it up, but it just wouldn’t stop.\n\nThe footsteps got louder and closer. “Four… *Thump.* Five… *Thump.* Six… *Thump.*” The sounds matched the counting, and I could see shadows of two thick legs under my bed.\n\n“Seven…” The door creaked open, the hinges squeaking like nails on a chalkboard. *Thump, oink.* The pig noises filled my room, wrapping around me like a scary hug. I held my breath, hoping it wouldn’t look under the bed.\n\n“Eight…” The creature’s heavy footsteps echoed through the room, each *thump* sending waves of dread coursing through me. As it moved, the shadows danced around its massive form, and I could hear the sound of its grotesque breathing, a wet rasp that filled the air with an unsettling tension.\n\nI noticed my stuffed animal counting again, its cheerful voice starkly contrasting the fear that gripped me. “Nine…” The words echoed in my mind, urging me to stay quiet, to stay hidden.\n\nThen, it paused just outside my line of sight, giving me a momentary illusion of safety. But then, slowly, the silhouette began to emerge from the darkness.\n\nAs it walked closer, I noticed the way its legs moved; they were stiff and jerky, as if it were a puppet being controlled by a cruel hand. Each step seemed deliberate, as if it was savoring the fear it instilled. The twisted hooves, gnarled and unnaturally shaped, dug into the carpet with a dull thud, leaving behind a lingering sense of dread.\n\nThe creature's grotesque body swayed with a disturbing rhythm, and I could see its long, unnaturally twisted limbs stretching toward the bed, casting dark, elongated shadows against the wall. It drew nearer, and I could hear the low grunts escape its throat, mingling with the distant echo of Peppa Pig’s cheerful voice from the TV, creating a haunting juxtaposition.\n\nFinally, it stood at the edge of my bed, its massive frame blocking out the faint glow of my nightlight. I could see the details more clearly now; the cracked skin, the wild bristles of hair, and the unnerving smile that twisted its face into a grotesque parody of joy.\n\nIt lowered itself down, its eyes fixated on me with a malevolent hunger. As it settled into place, I could feel the air grow heavy with its presence, a suffocating weight that made it hard to breathe.\n\nThe monstrous version of Peppa Pig loomed over me, and in that moment, all hope of hiding vanished. The realization hit me like a freight train: I was no longer just an observer in this nightmare; I was its prey.\n\n“Ten,” my stuffed animal chirped, its voice too cheerful for the dark scene unfolding before me. \n\nSuddenly, the creature screeched really loud, and it made every hair on my body stand up. With a swift motion, it pushed my bed aside, and I was no longer hiding. It saw me!\n\nStanding over me was a terrifying version of Peppa Pig, all twisted and wrong. Its head was huge like the cartoon, but its eyes were sunken in and dark, glowing red. The skin was all gross, like it was rotting away.\n\nIts smile was the worst a big, creepy grin that stretched too far, showing sharp, jagged teeth. The dress it wore was tattered and dirty, sticking to its big, grotesque body.\n\nThe scariest part was its snout, all twisted with sharp tusks sticking out. Each breath it took was a wet, raspy sound, and it smelled so bad, like something rotten.\n\nIt grabbed my legs, holding on tight. Its skin felt warm and rough, like old leather. As it started dragging me, I panicked and grabbed the door frame, trying to pull myself back.\n\nI almost made it!\n\nBut it was too strong. With one big yank, it pulled me out, and I screamed as I disappeared into the darkness. “AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!”\n\nMy stuffed animal lay on the floor, its cheerful voice echoing in the silence. “I can count to 10.”\n"},"865":{"title":"RedMoon.mkv — A cursed video.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ey0m6s\/redmoonmkv_a_cursed_video\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Xedone7","selftext":"Narrated by TheGhostOf94.

When I felt more clear I hopped up and unlatched the door and as I opened it there was a figure standing right at the door. startled I shut the door quickly and whoever was at the door began knocking. \n\n“Hello, I’m Sheriff Marley, Ms.Garrison mentioned you wanted to speak with me?” He stated \n\n“Still slightly panicked and groggy I answered “yeah you weren’t in the office.” \n And immediately stated “could you give me a moment? I’ll need to get dressed”\n\n I could hear him chuckling slightly through the door and he said “ sure, take your time, sir. I’ve got all day” \n\nI rapidly threw some clothes on and approached the door. Took a few sharp inhales to calm my nerves and proceeded to exit the room. \n\nThe sheriff seemed friendly and light-hearted enough to make me feel at ease after nearly frightening me to death first thing in the morning he asked me to follow him to the station to chat since I insisted on staying until we spoke so I got in my car and did exactly that. I noticed his uniform was a little more relaxed than you’d expect from a man of the law. Especially in a small town. Badge was crooked shirt was loosely tucked in hair messy and stubble grown out enough to form a 5 o’clock shadow that oddly suited him. His voice was solid and smooth reminded me of Ron Swanson a bit. I smirked to myself on the drive figuring that out. \n\nWe arrived at the station and there was no cruisers sitting outside at all this time. in fact aside from my jeep and his car there wasn’t a single vehicle in sight. I jumped out of the jeep and followed closely behind him as we entered the building. We made uncomfortable small talk while heading to an office\n “Take a seat Mister..?” He left the sentence hanging directing me to finish it \n“Morgan” I said \n“Right, have a seat Mr.Morgan” he said with a grin \nI sat down as he begun to speak “ so what exactly were you looking to accomplish here Mr.Morgan?”\n“Well Sheriff, I’m a private investigator, and I was hoping to get a closer look at any files pertaining to the Mary Benton Murder case from last year” I responded to which he asked\n“Do you have any ID to confirm your License is valid?”\n\n“Yes sir, right here in my jacket!” I explained and proceeded to show him my PI card. \n\nHe examined it very intently almost seeming frustrated that it was real. After a few moments he returned it to me and asked \n\n“Why are you looking into a buried case in the first place?” “I don’t normally permit P.I’s access to records either” \n\nI referenced some legal facts I got online that stated once a case was removed from active pursuance and placed in cold cases for filing outside investigation may obtain access to said files to assist in solving the case.\n\nHis demeanor quickly altered from pleasant and friendly to irritated and reserved. And he spoke \n“ Boy, did you read the part where any local office within the commanding jurisdiction still maintains a right to refuse outside investigators access unless the files are subpoenaed by a court order?” \n\nI rebutted “ I did sir, which is why I was hoping to speak with you to ask for access to the files without putting neither you or me through any unnecessary inconveniences” \n Followed by \n“With that being said, is there any way you would be willing to allow me to peak at the files for a bit and see if maybe there is something a fresh pair of eyes might be able to catch?” \n\nHe sighed quietly and looked up making heavy eye contact and said \n“son, if you really want to explore this path then by all means, I’ll pull the files myself for you” \n“So, are you certain this is what you want?” He asked\n\nWithout hesitation i said “absolutely, I just want to help”. \n\nEerily enough this feeling washed over me as if the whole world around me shifted tonally. Like the path chosen just altered the course of reality itself.  The sheriff walked me back to the waiting area and went to grab the files of noticed Shannon wasn’t at her Desk while we walked up front so I awkwardly stood there and waited for the sheriff to return. He took his time but when he returned he reluctantly relinquished the case files and gave me a glare that in the moment I interpreted as concern. \n\nI left the station and tried to shake off the end of that interaction. as I headed back to the motel, I attempted to glance at the files(I know, distracted driving is not cool) as I attempted to peak, I saw something cascade across the windshield reflection and reacted by slamming on my brakes I looked around to see what possibly it could’ve been but to my surprise there was nothing there. \n\nI returned to the motel at 7:06 am I only know this because I was surprised at how long I had been at the station after checking my watch . I sat down on the floor. spread out the Files page by page grabbed my notebook And began my first deep dive into the official case file for the murder of Mary Marie Benton I was astonished at how much more information these files contain then that was released online. For instance, the initial suspect was Jonathan Benton Mary’s husband, not surprising at all considering standard procedure dictates the first suspect is the closest to the victim.\n\nMary’s  maiden name Was actually Mosier and she grew up in a small town miles away named Fonda. I had been there before and the similarities between Milton and Fonda. We’re Near perfect, like comparing apples to apples. Some of the redacted photos from online actually appeared with the filing which I was relieved to discover, but that changed shortly after looking at them. in my mind, I begin to think that maybe this is where sheriff Marley’s look of concern stemmed from. The crime scene photos, verses, the descriptions, I read previously Gave zero preparation against actually seeing them. \nA\nI’m not entirely try c certain how long exactly I sat there looking everything over in fact if you had told me how long how long my eyes were glued to these pages I probably wouldn’t have believed you as I stood up and stretched. I walked over to the curtains while pulling them open it looked like the sun was setting. I checked my watch again, it said 7:06 pm momentarily confused    (Within reason) I checked my notes which I’ll  rewrite below considering my terrible handwriting. \n Mary’s corpse was discovered at precisely 4:44 am .\nshe was last seen by her husband John after an argument over bills he claimed. \n\nShe packed up her car and started driving towards the gas station.\n\nher car was found 2 miles from where her body was discovered  at Mile Marker 13 \n\nthe farmer who found her: Caleb Caruthers and his two hounds refused to give any other statements following his call to the police. \n\nHe was listed as a suspect due to his dogs having a reputation for aggressive behavior by locals\n\nThe other two suspects listed were obviously her husband who allegedly moved out of state following her murder after being cleared of any involvement \n\nAnd the town veterinary doctor. Who was an avid hunter and recluse. \n\nHe was cleared as a suspect based on an alibi corroborated by video evidence. \n\nMary’s body was torn to shreds basically and none of the wounds sustained were similar leaving no trace of a distinct weapon used to commit the murder. \n\nThe police attempted to track down a bear that was allegedly sighted in town a few weeks prior \n\nThe venomous substance found in the pathology lab was unidentified after multiple tests were conducted. \n\nA psychic investigator claimed there were other elements in play that were unknown to law enforcement to which the police gave no merit. \n\nWithout any evidence other than a body the police had no trail and ultimately decided the case would go unsolved. \n \n\nAll of this information gave me a few destinations to explore and a few people who I would like to interview and see if there was anything missed that could have helped solve this mystery. So I wrote down \n\n* Mile Marker 13 \n* 2626 Corinth circle - psychics home \n* Farmhouse across the street-Caruthers residence. \n* 3322 Mathias lane - John and Mary’s old home \n* Motel receptionist -Carson Caruthers- the farmers son \n\n\n\nI guess tomorrow will be a busy day "},"867":{"title":"I made a discord roleplay gc for creepypasta and I wanna know if anyone wants to join! 😋 (some characters are taken so just ask me)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ey3rsf\/i_made_a_discord_roleplay_gc_for_creepypasta_and\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"J03L_1","selftext":"J"},"868":{"title":"She Watches Me At Night ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exvqmd\/she_watches_me_at_night\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"cosmiclocs","selftext":"\"For as long as I can remember, it has been my mom and I. Well, my mom, me, and her. I gave her the official name, the night stalker long ago. Even after all these years, I still don't know why she appears, what she wants, or what she even is. Her overall appearance is humanoid, minus genitals or nipples. She has the appearance of breasts, hence why I deemed her a woman, but no other overtly feminine or masculine traits. The few strands of hair that adorn her head are wispy and scraggly. They fall over an abnormally large forehead that tapers into a sharp chin. Her sickeningly wide mouth stretches from ear to ear. Or, at least, it would if she had any. The best way to describe my night stalker is if that Momo thing had an alien head and way less hair. She is tall. Not the kind of tall that elicits questions about your athletic abilities, but the kind that draws unwelcomed stares and finger-pointing. She crouches just low enough to stare at me through my doorway. This has been happening since I was about 5 or 6 years old. \n\nIn the beginning, I was terrified. I still am, but after nearly a decade of this happening nightly, you learn to deal with it, especially when no one believes you. My night stalker has been the reason behind many visits to several therapists and psychiatrists. After a brief stay in a mental facility at age 12, I realized that no one was going to help me. I played the role like I was better. My only options seemed to be to deal with my night stalker on my own or continue to be drug from doctor to doctor and facility after facility. So I chose the former. I've tried everything over the years from saging the house to taking up traditional religion, even to witchcraft. But still, she remains watching me every single night. Some will read this and question why I didn't just shut my door at night. I tried that possible solution and spent the entire night hiding under the covers as my night stalker wailed, scratched &amp; pawed at my door. The next morning I asked Mom if she heard any noises throughout the night &amp; was met with a familiar look of worry. I quickly dropped the subject as the answer was apparent. \n\nI even thought that maybe our house was haunted, but after my first and last sleepover at 9, I was proven very wrong. A girl named Anna invited me to her birthday sleepover. It was a fun, joyous time filled with cake, ice cream, and giggles. As night approached, I felt confident that I had left my night stalker at home and could enjoy a peaceful night's sleep for once. I was quickly proved wrong as the shadowy image of her lanky form watched me silently from the corner of Anna's living room. Needless to say, that was my first and last sleepover as I frantically awoke Anna's parents to contact my mother to pick me up at 1am. I explained it away as being homesick, but I think she knew better.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, acceptance finally crept in as this entity seemed bound to haunt my nights forevermore. That was until recently.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I saw her in daylight. While daydreaming in science class, I looked out the window and there she was in all her horrifying glory. Standing nearly as tall as the tree in the campus courtyard. In the light of day, I could see every wrinkle that marred her pale white skin. Skin that rested over a frail skeleton that stood its entire unnatural length. She just stood there with her gauntly long arms resting at her sides. If it were not for the menacing smile that crept across her face, I could've assumed she was some early Halloween decoration. Upon seeing such a ghoulish sight, most would scream bloody murder. And even now as I write this letter, I'm still unsure if it was shock, the acceptance of an inevitable fate, or both that prevented any sound from escaping my lips. I recall looking around the room to see if anyone else had noticed. Most were paying attention to the lecture and the handful that were also daydreaming out the window showed no signs that they were also seeing the gruesome apparition. Ever since then, I have continued to see her in both daytime and at night. She maintains a healthy distance in the light but has begun to inch closer every night.\n\nFor years, she has stood several feet outside my doorway during her regular nighttime visits. I know she hasn't moved in all these years because her position has always been right across from the large painting in our hallway that my mom bought when I was around 7. In the two weeks since my night stalker's first appearance in the daytime, she has migrated past the wall painting and made it to my door. Which brings me to the ultimate purpose of this letter. Two nights ago I awoke to see her standing just inside the threshold of my door. And last night she stood just feet from my bed. I don't know for sure what will happen when she reaches me, but I have an idea, and it terrifies me beyond belief. I've tried to delay going to sleep as long as I could, but even now as the night continues to grow darker, I feel frigid breath on my neck. To those who didn't believe me, who called me imaginative, crazy, or just a straight-up liar, I forgive you. Somewhere along the way, I found forgiveness. And though I still fear my fate, I hope there is peace in the next plane of existence.\"\n \n\nThis letter was found at the scene of the horrendous murder of 16-year-old Hannah Stevens. Stevens was found mutilated beyond recognition in her home. Reports say her mother was unaware of the gruesome scene mere feet away from her as she heard nothing. It wasn't until she went to wake Hannah for school that she discovered the devastating scene. It was also reported that though there were no other residents currently living in the Stevens' home, DNA testing was necessary to positively identify the remains. There were no signs of a break-in or intruder sources say. At the time, police aren't releasing any new information, but ask that if anyone has any info to please contact the Granite Falls Police Department at 555-567-0000.\n"},"869":{"title":"See You In Your Dreams ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exyar9\/see_you_in_your_dreams\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"AllTheHubbubb","selftext":"I woke up at 3:06 pm because I couldn't sleep well for the past two days. My window was cracked because I enjoy the cool breeze seeping in during the fall nights. Halloween is only a week away and I'm excited for my friends party he's having before he leaves for school. I go to my closet and pull out my Vietnam veteran costume, then lay it on the bed. The helmet, boots, pants, and shirt are all in order. It's perfect! I hop on the bed and grab my phone to go on a TikTok live and share with my followers how my costume looks. \n\nSlowly but surely my audience grows. Starts off with 10 viewers then eventually around 200 people are watching. \n\n\"Wow, it looks so authentic!\" Someone says to me as I hold it up to the camera. Everyone else is very appreciative of it and it makes me so happy. Well, everyone but this one person. Their name was SeeYouInYourDreams and their profile picture had a person in a weird lifeless looking mask. The eyes were eccentrically large and looked like black holes, also there wasn't a mouth. The mask was dirty and had some cracks on the exterior. \n\n\"Why don't you ever sleep well, Percy?\" They commented\n\n\"Oh sometimes it's like insomnia I get leading up to an event\", I answered. \n\nAnother minute went by and the person comments again, \"Yeah, I know you can't ever sleep well.\" \n\nI look at the comment weirded out and asked, \"Do I know you or something? Is this Cory fucking with me?\" But they didn't answer for a while. Finally the person comes back and says, \"how about you close that window, it's awfully chilly tonight.\" \n\nMy heart started pounding because my window was never on view of the camera, only my headboard on my bed. \n\n\"How did you know my window was open?\" I'm block you, dude, or ma'am, or whoever you are.\" I said and frantically tried to click the block button on their profile. But, nothing it didn't work. I tried again over and over but nothing happened. \n\n\"Nice try...\" He commented in an ominous manner. \n\nI tried to end my live but that button wouldn't work either. I didn't know what to do, then I hear a noise in my kitchen. I get up and take my phone. I tell people in the chat to screen record in case something happens. \n\n\"Did something startle you, Percy? You should really lock your doors at night. There are a lot of evil people out there.\" \n\n\"This shit isn't funny! I have a fucking gun and if anyone is wanting to fuck with me...\" I stop talking after seeing my whole screen go white. Then the image of the mask pops on my screen. I jump back so hard and drop my phone on the kitchen floor. The live chat comes back and I tell everyone what I saw. The comments are going by so fast and there's 700 people in there. More than I ever had on a live. \n\n\"Call the cops!\" \n\n\"Dude you better get your gun.\" \n\n\"Who the hell is this guy?\" \n\nThose are some of the comments I'm able to read and get frustrated because I can't exit the app. All of a sudden I smell something, something like sulfur and a public bathroom. I can't pinpoint where the smell is coming from so I run back to my room and lock my door. \n\nPERCY \nPERCY \nPERCY \nPERCY\nPERCY\nPERCY\nPERCY\n\nThe person comments over and over, while there's bangs at my bedroom door. Sounded like someone tried to kick it in. My heart is beating out of my chest and I reach under my bed to grab my gun out the case. I start loading it but my hands are trembling. Then as soon as I get several bullets in the clip I aim it at the door and shoot twice. The banging stops. I walk over to look through he holes left and there's no one there. I open the door and look around, no blood or signs of anyone. My phone still in my hand I check the comments and the viewers have gone up to 1,300. The person comments again, \"🤣🤣🤣 That won't work.\" \n\nI run straight to the front door and it's locked. I can't even leave the house. \n\n\"You aren't going anywhere, Percy. Sit down and relax.\" \n\nI throw my phone across the room and get under my blanket like a scared little kid. However my phone's light suddenly lights up my last resort fortress. It's under my blanket with me standing straight up on the bed. The masked face comes back on the screen and starts spinning slowly while staring back at me.\n\n\"Leave me alone mother fucker!\" I yell as loud as I can then I wake up. It was all a dream, none of this ever happened. I roll over and my phone is on 1%. I grab my charger cord to plug it in then a message pops up on screen. It reads, \"see you in your dreams.\" \n\n"},"870":{"title":"Chilling Tales of Cape Hatteras Beach","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ey3psg\/chilling_tales_of_cape_hatteras_beach\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Explore the haunted history of Cape Hatteras Beach.

I have been doing it for many years now and I like to do it. It's such a simple job and I enjoy its simplicity and its simple joy that it brings to my customers. I love cleaning windows to such a perfection and I love using the equipments to do it. I love the way I do it and making sure every dirt on the window has gone. I enjoy using my technique to clean the windows and it gives me such satisfaction. I am known to the community as the window cleaner. \n\nOne day I went to a house and I have cleaned their windows before, but this day something strange happened. As I was cleaning their windows I could see the whole family sitting in the front room. Some were watching TV and some were on their phones. As I cleaned the front room window and wiping away the liquid and water with such technique and precision, suddenly the whole family were dead. Blood was everywhere and just seconds ago they were alive and now they were dead after I cleaned their windows. This was bizarre. \n\nI mean for someone to kill the parents and 3 teenage children, it will take over an hour. This was like in a blink of an eye, now I decided to clean the front room windows again. As I cleaned the front room windows again using amazing wiping technique, I was really enjoying cleaning the windows. Then the family were alive again, but this time they had weird shaped bodies. Then I washed and wiped the front room windows again, then the family had animal bodies with their human heads still attached to the animal bodies. Everytime I wiped down the windows, the family would end up different. \n\nThen after constantly cleaning the front room windows, the family were back to normal. It like when I splash the windows with liquid and water, it's like it acts as a curtain for the family to change form in private, then when I wipe it down I see the new change. When I cleaned the front room windows again and the family were now divided into bits. Their body parts were all over the place but they were still alive. \n\nI went inside the house and I hoped it was trickery, but it wasn't. It was all real. I kept washing the front room windows so many times and the family were now a completely different race.

The hum bouncing off the parking garages concrete walls. That's where I found him--dead.\nThe parking garage always had a humming from stainless metal fans to circulate the humid and hot Virginia air. Walking closer to the truck I saw his chemical box in the bed of the truck was open with the top flap sticking straight up. I thought nothing weird about the open box, from time to time we steal (chem we call it)from other trucks. For the summer the company buys out dozens of rooms for the employees to stay. Most employees are door to door salesmen who make a living selling pest control as a same day service. Where Jake and I, with a few others, come into play is after the sale. The ones who actually spray your house, the ones who interact with the customers and bring them down to reality after the salesmen fluff our feathers, or are they fluffing their own? We are the ones who click the rap trap mouths in place, with black jagged teeth…waiting, with the delicious neon blue food for the rats to nibble on and share with their newborns. We had 7 other trucks in the parking garage and from time to time chem went missing. Sometimes us technicians didn't want to wake up early and drive 30 minutes to the office to pick up materials, truckers were closer, much closer. I'd be lying to you if I didn't steal a de-weber every now and then off a truck, but I always made no trace of the thievery. I can't speak for everyone though. So when that lid was pointing up to the rusty pipes and concrete ceiling above, I wasn't surprised, hell I might have had a smirk on my face. \n\nWith the swing of my arm I slapped the box closed, a whiff of chemicals spewed out and hit my nose which gave me a feeling of a stinging sneeze that never comes. I gave the window a knock to see if he would turn around.. Silence. I got closer to see if he was glued to his phone and didn't hear me or didn’t bother looking. I put my hands up on the window and smushed my eyebrows against my index fingers to get a better look. I saw the seat was fully reclined back, him laying there…still as a morning lake. I knocked on the smaller back half door. Tap tap TAP. No movement. It was too dark to see so I dug my hand in my pocket to get my phone light out and put it flush to the back oval airplane shaped window. That's when I saw this face—— god his face—— skin a purplish hue and pulled taught by swelling, eyes adrift and red which were bulging out like they wanted to leave, jaw open with dark fluid sitting in his mouth, escaping on the sides. The streaks of dark liquid rolled down his purple face, curving down the back of his neck, and dribbling down the strands of hair meeting the head rest. My eyelids opened so wide they touched my eyebrows. His fingers curled limply around a chemical bottle, cap off and the liquid color matching that of the pool in his mouth…  \n“Jake” I whispered, my voice feels like it was stolen from me, my skin is tingling like an unknown channel on tv as heat takes over… I begin to fall, the last thing I notice are my fingers streaking down the window. I passed out. \n          \n4 months pass\n I'm moving out of the building where it happened. I’ve wanted to get out of this building since it happened, but didn’t have the financial backing. Now I plan to stay in Virginia for the winter and move in with roommates from the pest control company. The salesmen call this time their “off season” due to them all leaving and going back home, most to Vegas. My other two roommates run the regular technician routes which consist of stopping at 14-15 designated houses a day, spraying chemicals and setting traps to take care of the contracts those grimy salesmen sell. \nI used to share a room with jake. All of his things were taken out either by investigators or the maid service. The other roommates in the building told me to combine the abandoned twin bed with mine but I never touched it, I couldn't.\n\nI’m making this entry due to finding something. Something I believe was very close to Jake. The last day of moving I had everything packed but my mattress and box spring. While moving my mattress lazily with the sheet still on I lost grip and it hit his mattress sliding it off the box spring and hitting the wall. I let go of my mattress automatically and wanted to fix his bed…. Preserve it. I wrapped my hands around his mattress when a wave of dizziness veiled over me. My hands became clammy and I didn't want to touch his mattress anymore, like a kid that doesn't want to touch an old person. I had to put it back! If I didn't it would haunt me forever my mind yelled  at me. Just as I forced myself to slide the mattress back, my middle knuckle dropped into a slight groove, and I stopped in place. I pushed the mattress to the right and traced where my knuckle had been and found a slit in the box spring. I hesitated, staring at the unnatural slash in the cloth, Thinking about when Jake and I would make fun of our manager who always had a bone to pick with jake ever since the first day they met, the new manager 2 years younger than us yelling at jake to tuck his shirt in while his own untucked, covered his belt and belly. A smile slowly disappeared from my face as I was brought back with my whole forearm now in the slit of the box spring. My fingers clutched an object that had to be a book. I pulled My arm out of the box spring like pulling a calf out of its mother, now half expecting to see red viscous liquid and tiny wet legs, my eyes shut slowly like elevator doors closing. \nMy hand appeared dry and my fingers clenched around a book of sorts. The outside of the book was void of color, almost like it absorbed it instead. I sat down on my thrown mattress and the empty apartment surrounded me. I flipped to the first page as the spine creaked at me, I saw Jake's name and it clicked in me that this wasn't a book. It was Jake's notebook! I flipped page after page reading Jacob’s writings about days of killing bugs and missing home till I got to the page. Sometimes I wish I wasn't lazy, I could have taken the sheet off the bed, this would have never happened, I would have never found the notebook. The apartment seemed to be silently closing in on me now like I was in the digestive tract of some huge monster. God the page—— in big dark letters he had written “THE LADY IN THE BASEMENT IS THE REASON WHY I AM GONE.” I was stuck reading the words again and again thinking I was seeing things. My heart was pumping so vigorously I could hear it agitate the fabric of my shirt little by little each beat. There was a  arrow so dark that seemed to suck in light and pointed toward the right of the page wanting someone to flip it or something to flip it, so I did. For the next pages he wrote why…. And I clinging to every word …began to read.\n2 months pass \nThe warm thick air has passed now, leaving a cold grey in the air. Virginia feels less claustrophobic with the heat gone. Winter is stinging its way into the picture more and more, breath starting to become visible almost every day. \nMy new apartment looks over the town of Arlington which is a nice view from the 13th floor. Whenever people ask where I live I tell them, “it’s 5 minutes from the pentagon,” I’ve said it so much it numbs me. \nThere are 3 guys in total that live in this apartment so the decor is minimal at best. Our tv stand is an upside down plastic bin, with our coffee table another bin, at least its a set. The floor is thick and worn carpet, light tan in color. The walls have the same yellowish void look. My favorite part of the apartment is the balcony that spans the whole side of the living room to which I can see a sliver of the Potomac river, an icy cold thing this time of year.  \nI've marinated in Jake's notebook for a while, I think I’m ready to share some of what is inside. Jake goes into extreme detail about these situations so I’ll just copy them down for you all to read, I think that is what’s best. \n \n                                                                 -Jake’s notebook-\nThursday July 18th 2020 (7 months ago) \nToday I am changed. \nIt was right after lunch when my work phone notified me a house was booked. Usually I disliked the salesmen but the one that booked me was just alright, tolerable. I pulled into the neighborhood as the sun dimmed from clouds rolling in, storm maybe. Multiple groups of six townhomes were placed throughout the neighborhood with tall trees and bush linking them. The small homes shared walls only separated by a slight offset in depth, looking like crooked teeth. Porches stuck out a measly foot from the homes which were more for decoration than enjoyment. The porches all had different faded color variations that staggered from each house, blue, red, orange, green, and back to blue. The peeling wood porches had the style of a western movie set which I thought interesting, but I knew the webs were going to be a bitch to get out. I rolled up to the address the app told me as the salesmen popped out of some trees to greet me, probably pissing. I rolled down the window and stopped the truck, wheels stopping the popping of gravel underneath. He gave me the rundown of the house while leaning on the windowsill of my truck, where the smell of sweat leaked in from him. He mentioned the old woman that lived in the townhome and said she was oddball but kind. I thought nothing of it, just another job before getting off. As I parked the car, I asked the salesmen, “ interior?”  He replied, “yes.”   \nMy shoe covers zipped on the asphalt as I walked toward the door, pump tank in my hand. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. The old woman opened the splintered door as I introduced myself and got all the signatures I needed to apply the pesticides, legal reasons. The first thing I noticed about the woman was her eyes, they looked worn, tired as if she stayed up all night… or something was keeping her up. I smiled as I slipped the signed papers in the back pocket of my jeans, she reciprocated the smile and pushed the door open wide as creaks escaped the henges. Right before I stepped in I saw the salesmen grab a dewebber from my truck, he is alright this salesmen. I looked back and the old woman kept her eyes on my face, I smiled again to break the slight awkwardness. The smell of wet concrete hit my nose when I stepped in the home, it started to rain behind me, it cut off as the door closed behind me. \nThe old woman’s home was tight like lungs that never sucked air back in. The layout was like a strip of gum, the start was the door I walked through and The end was the living room which had a step down. She offered me water which I politely declined, I could see the kindness the salesmen were talking about. The home was filled with random Knick knacks but wasn't messy, organized chaos. I asked her the routine questions about bugs like where she was seeing them to which she replied almost everywhere, thank god this was a small home. I started to spray in the kitchen around the sides of the refrigerator and the baseboards and the woman followed me almost attached to the hip or like an obedient dog. I didn't think it weird, she kept conversation and genuinely looked fascinated about where I sprayed while listening to my little tips I replayed from the back of my mind of how to keep bugs away. We rounded the kitchen and stepped down into the living room where carpet matched my boot covers with peppered static zaps. I sprayed the sliding back door focusing on the bottom track where bug highways usually gravitated. Then I traced the baseboards around the living room, avoiding wires powering lamps and televisions. I heard quick stomps coming down the stairs to which I gave a glance of curiosity to the bottom of the staircase and temporarily lifted my hand off the spray trigger. A child rounded the corner and ran to the old woman yelling, “grandma!”  Must have woken up from a nap or something. The child then looked up at me and asked who I was and she explained in young terms, “he is here to make the bugs go away.” I smiled at that to reaffirm the old woman's version of me she gave, I was a version who told the bugs to go away, not kill them by the thousands. I liked that version of myself. \nI had finished treating the main floor and now followed the old woman and child up the stairs. Her blue veins bulged out of her papery skinned hands, scratching her grandson's head. I went through every room, closet, bathroom, and windowsill spraying with the old woman still following me everywhere I went, pointing out the hotspots, her close presence becoming normal, almost warming as she reminded me of my grandmother. The child seemed just as interested as his grandmother about how I spray and I thought it wholesome. After this Things took a dark sinister turn. \nMy job was now finished. We were all on the main floor and I began to reach for the front door and tell her we would finish the outside service now when she for the first time broke her distance from me. This made me feel, for lack of better words, alone. She steadily glided toward the living room not looking back and she stepped down the dip heading for the couch. Did she forget I was still in the house? Did she imagine opening the door and letting me out? The kid then followed her and jumped off the small dip in childlike fashion into the living room and landed on the carpet, gracing his tumble. The old woman never sat down, and her back was facing me as she stood there…. still. Why didn't she sit down? She broke the silence right as my fingers touched the front door knob, her voice was colder now, “won't you come here for a second?” \nThe knob rang numbly for a split second as my hands slid off. I then took a step toward the living room slowly. The rain now beat on the old woman's back door, with the flash of illumination, lightning struck close, then thought of the salesmen with the metal dewebber pole, that combination like brushing teeth and orange juice. The thought was erased as the tip of my  boots hung off the step to the living room. I looked at the woman's face and stepped hesitantly into the living room, the dark green carpet like a hard sponge under my boots. Her wiry hair now covers some of her face with a blank stare. The kid now hugging her legs hiding his whole body except the right side of his face, his one eyeball piercing me. Her hair was delayed as she snapped her head at me, then the hair caught up and fell. Her face then shook like when a student tries to stay awake in class, she then looked around, lost and took a deep breath. She said, “ sorry sometimes I get these headaches-- they just take over me,” as she laughed it off dryly. I told her “it's fine and I get them too,” I get them too? Are you stupid jake? She then raised her old saggy arm pointing to a door. I knew what this door led to being in hundreds of townhomes with the same layout, they led to the basement. “Dear please spray the basement too, will you? \nBefore I could answer the kid somewhat loudly asked, “wait grandma… he is going into the basement? Grandma! Why the basement?” I thought of this very odd as my neck chilled to goosebumps. I stepped back up onto the wood and stopped at the tooth white door expecting the old lady to open it for me, she had done this the whole way through the house, opening cabinets, windows, doors, flipping on light switches for me but here I am with the old woman standing firm in the same spot and the kid saying the same question starting to cry. I looked back at the door as she said, “yes that door, the light switch is on the left, close the door when going down… we don't go down in the basement.” My heart started to race and my fingers and forearm twisted the knob, opening the door replaying, “we don't go down in the basement, we don't go down in the basement,” What the fuck does that mean! I took one last look at her and saw only a part of the woman, due to the kitchen wall, sit down and grab something off her neck and sifting it through her hands. She then did something my ears will never forget, she started to pray in Spanish… and I took my first step down. \nI shut the door behind me and then I switched the light on. It was very dim, only giving me the bare minimum brightness to reach the bottom. The walls were different as I descended, the light didn't bounce off them, instead the walls let the light in. The old woman's prayers and child's crying muffled the creaks the wooden staircase gave off. The prayers were getting louder. I dreadfully got on the floor of the basement now. To the left, a wall, to the right, a long hallway leading to complete and utter darkness. My body felt a shiver like flying to a cold part of the world and those airport doors exposing you to the weather for the first time. My head naturally looked down at my feet for some reason. There was a door to the right of me now which I saw coming down the stairs. I shifted toward it with my boot covers scraping the carpet tips, uneasily I opened it. The boiler room was dark as the swing of the door brought a string to my vision. The light for this room of course is a fucking string light. I pulled on it hard and light struggled to do its job. The light reminded me of when my 7th grade science teacher, mr. Crutcher, told us what would happen if a light bulb traveled the speed of light in space, “you will see the light, yes! But it will reflect no light! Precisely! what is a light but more than a mere tool that reflects light off of other things!” The memory should have put a smile on my face.\n I then sprayed around the water heater and cotton candy pink insulation sticking out from the room walls. My heart began beating faster and a veil of sickness came over me. The cold got stronger. The place was sick itself. Holding my hand up and wrapped around the string I paused, something deep inside of me telling me not to shut the light off, I almost felt as if someone with a remote was controlling my movements, I was separated from myself. I let the string slither out of my hand as I walked out of the room now looking back down at my boots, as if something didn't want me to look up. What would I see if I looked up? The exposed insulation made the old woman's prayers fuzzed, but now I was back in the hallway I could hear the extent of it. She was screaming now. I imagined her old neck veins popping, blue miniature rivers flowing up to her wrinkly face. \nI faced the hallway now, the walls darkening the further they got from the top stairway light. My brain was yelling at me to hurry and go as fast as I could but my body did not listen, we were disconnected. I took my first step still looking at my feet seeing the dark entrance from the hallway get closer, another step I go, I get closer, step, closer. I now know the sick thing in this home is in the dark void I approach with every step… waiting. \nI finally reach the end of the hallway and my body stops. The old woman's screams reach a pinnacle. The kid crying and yelling accompanies it. I am all alone. Even my brain is alone. I can do nothing. The darkness is all around me. I twitch my head to the right, it reminds me of the old woman's movements, and reach my hand out to feel for a light switch, nothing. When I do this I can see in the dark room slightly my hat shading me from most, not all. My head comes back down to the center. I feel like throwing up now, my sickness is terrible. My head is spinning and so is my stomach. All of my extremities are ice now. Now I twitch my head to the left, I have to reach in between what looks like a dresser. I push my hand through. My hand grazes the sandpapery wall and I feel a switch! My heart relaxes from the touch. Finally I'm not alone anymore, the light switch accompanies me. \nClick…my finger flips the switch. My stomach drops. Click. CLICK.CLICK. NOTHING. My breathing seems like a car engine that just turned over. The only thing that was with me is now gone. No light. I won't move. I can't move. My hat doesn't cover it all. There is a jolt of movement in the darkness accompanied by the sound of bones snapping under loose skin. My eyes widen like headlights turning on. The stinging of the hallway light behind me becomes audible and it pops in its shell as I hear the glass pieces scrape toward the middle of the bowl shaped cover. There is no more light except bleeding out the boiler room. I hear hinges yawn as the door closes, sucking the only light left in the basement. I now feel like I’m floating, my eyes have nothing to cling to for a sense of space. The sounds of bones breaking and almost moving under skin get closer. The air is thick around me. From out of the darkness a woman’s playful voice scrapes out, “ I seee youuu.” \nMy body snapped out of its immovable grasp. I sprinted toward where I thought the stairs were, I hit the wall at the end of the hallway, hearing the bones snapping sound following. I made a left up the first landing step as my shoe covers slipped on the carpet. My nails digging up the steps as I regained my footing. I hear a woman's voice sing in monotone, “La La La La La,’ feeling each “La,” getting closer to my neck. The boiler room door now swung open and slammed closed over and over almost like it was clapping for something. The metal pump tank hit each carpeted step with a muffled clang. My skin was slick with sweat as my body galloped up the stairs. I saw the outline of the door come into view right as the sound behind me to which I could only describe as elastic skin tearing away from itself making a snapping sound. behind me it let out a gurgled scream right before I burst through the door. \nCRACK. The door swung open as I got ahead of it and slammed it just as fast. I held the door closed expecting to meet a bounce or break in the wood. Nothing. I turned my head to the old woman and she was staring at me with wide bloodshot eyes holding a rosary in her spotted hands. The kid's wet face did the same stare. The old woman’s voice cracked, “your back?” \nI walked out of that house yelling, “IM DONE,” at the top of my lungs. I had nothing else to say. I was drained. The rain hit me accompanied by the humidity as I walked to the truck. I threw my shit in the back and hopped in the driver's seat. The cabin filled with the smell of wet dog. I called my boss and said I got sick and I needed the rest of the day off. I sit here now in the high rise writing this. The rain is drumming against the windows. The dark clouds color everything in a shade of gray. I needed to get this out, I can’t tell anyone, they wouldn’t believe me. So I write, like I’ve always done… \nEND OF ENTRY \nI closed the notebook, unable to read on to the next entry. I sat at my desk with no words to say. I need a break. I got up and poured a heavy glass of whiskey and touched my lips with the glass. Smooth warm liquid ran down my throat. \nI need time to process this, I’m sure you all do too. I will upload more of Jake’s entries when I have the time. Thank you all for reading. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"873":{"title":"Whatever YOU do, NEVER tell the people in your Dreams they are not Real | Original Content","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exio7z\/whatever_you_do_never_tell_the_people_in_your\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"mielgosez","selftext":"Some people have lucid dreams.

Through my digging I’ve come to find that even early into its construction things about the project seemed off. \n\nBefore construction even began the area chosen to house the accelerator has played host of a number of strange occurrences and natural disasters. A farmer who lived on the property back in the 40s was struck by lightning 17 times, a tourist from Italy wandered away from a tour group and ended up caught in bailor, and of course the many tales of UFO encounters. \n\nIn 1996 construction began on the Phanes accelerator in Athens. The project was funded by Plutus Robotics (Atomic Research Division) and was staffed by students from The National Technical University of Athens. \n\nConstruction and later experimentation was overseen by Dr. Ceres head of the Atomic research division of Plutus Robotics. Dr. Ceres had something of a history of shady dealings both with the Koios University of Science &amp; Technology lab fire in 1975, and the Oxford neutrino beam money laundering debacle. \n\nDuring the presentation given to the Administrative Board of NTUA by The Plutus Robotics representative, reportedly only a series of slides depicting several illegible highly ornate hand written letters were shown. \n\nMembers of the Administrative Board would later go on to claim they had been shown detailed diagrams of the lengthy safety measures taken to protect their students, yet no two of these accounts agree upon what those safety measures were. \n\nMany reports of strange activity on the construction cite were made by civilians, one such story is particularly striking in retrospect. Amongst others and at the time 22 year old Alexia Drakos, claims to have seen flickering spectral lights moving like figures across the cite several months before the project was to publicly announced. \n\n“They were blue, floated just off the ground moving like billows of smoke, they burnt everything they came in contact with, leaving behind scorched lines where they passed”. Alexia Drakos August 17th 1997. \n\nHopes were high that this state of the art piece of equipment would firmly establish Greece as a central and key figure in the future of particle physics. As Phanes was a superconducting cyclotron accelerator expectations were placed firmly in the realm of rare isotope production, however very little progress was made in this area. \n\nOn September the 14th of 1997 the accelerator would claim its first victim, when a member of the construction team was startled by a sudden and unexpected puff of compressed air, and bumped a canister of liquid nitrogen. The pressurized canister burst resulting in severe cold burns and frostbite across 30% of his body. The anonymous man lost all 10 of his fingers along with an ear and a portion of his nose. \n\nNo comment by the man was made, as Plutus Plutus was quick to step in with a settlement deal. This was only the first instance of the mega conglomerate stepping in to moderate the situation, later offering the other survivors similar deals, notable neither of which accepted. \n\nIn the days after multiple staff members reported seeing flickering anomalies on the monitors, specifically light blue or violet luminous smoke. These signings were paired with often heard faint whispers always just out of hearing range without any detectable origination point. \n\nOn December the 7th of 1997 the first test run of the accelerator was performed. During this fairly routine head to head proton collision the first of the accidents would occur. An unexpectedly large and sudden spike of gamma radiation 15 times the amount expected or normally accounted for would surge through the system nearly 10 minutes after the proton collision. \n\nThis surge happened in a layer of the collider wall not fully insulated, resulting in serval people in it’s pathway getting mildly irradiated. While no serious injury occurred the incident was unprecedented, setting *putting\/leaving the entire research team on edge. \n\nDr. Ceres was notably not concerned pushing the team to get back to work as soon as possible to do another run insisting the situation was all “a sensor error”. Though of course this would not the be the last accident. \n\nSeveral non eventual tests were run, 2 more with protons, and once again with neutrons. The results although slightly anomalous were within normal range, giving the team a sense of false safety. \n\nEven with this reassurance things would still continue to get weirder, with Dr. Ceres becoming withdrawn, shutting down discussions and frantically working on the notes for an unnamed project. Serval members of the research team made note of strange and surreal dreams they experienced in the weeks leading up to the event. \n\nOn January the 24th 1998 the Phanes Superconducting Cyclotron Accelerator was turned on for the final time. This is where reports become more widely available and clear in their statements. \n\nThe following is compiled from official reporting as well as the firsthand account by Drs Elizabeth Quinn, and Marco Barlos.\nNothing about the fourth test run was routine, safe, or approved. Dr. Ceres along with the main research team members had locked themselves in the control center for the accelerator actively fighting off attempts to enter. Dr. Ceres then instructed the team to arrange themselves into a closed circle around a small glass prism. \n\nNeither of the survivors can explain why they were so willingly *willing to go along with such a reckless plan, stating that at the time they’d been utterly convinced that Dr. Ceres knew best. Both survivors maintain that they were given a written invitation to a gathering at the accelerator, though only serval illegible cards were ever recovered. \n\nDr. Ceres proceeded to fire up the experiment. The accelerator was never intended on being a used for heavy ion collisions, yet would be gold ions would be used. The collision is hypothesized to have been the first to create a quark plasma though no reading data survived the disaster. \n\nUpon the collision survivors describe a resounding boom like a thunderclap, accompanied by the room shaking, lights flickering out, and multiple electronics in the room sparking and shorting out.\n\nThe entire nearby electrical grid has burst due to a large electrical surge. The research team however did not find themselves in total darkness. The room was lit by a sudden almost blindingly bright *blinding flash of blue light. \n\nThe brilliant azure glow would continue to linger, Cherenkov radiation illuminating the team of researchers. A billion particles breaking the airs light barrier causing excess energy being shed in the form of blue light. The light seemed to emanate from the crystal prism, casting the room in flickering shadows. \n\nEach member of the team was subject of extreme doses of radiation, most dying within days of the exposure. The gamma rays tore through their DNA, leaving their cells unable to replicate, giving them a slow the miserable death of rotting alive. Slowly their cells liquifying away until the lines between life and death blur together. \n\nEven the two longest living survivors suffering minor radiation poisoning and burns. Each going onto have multiple extending complications including a rare form of leukemia which would go on to claim the life of Dr. Barlos. \n\nBut this would not *be the end of the ordeal, several minutes after the initial collision a section of the coolant system would break, weakening the structural momentum integrity of the accelerator. This was followed by an inexplicable explosion which blew out the northeastern side of the lab, doing almost two million dollars worth of damage. Notably instead of an explosion, both survivors describe the arrival of “visitors”. \n\n(Excerpt from interviews)\n\n“There was no explosion, We were all in a state of shock, no one dared to move or even breath, Dr. Ceres was manic ranting and raving about calculations, throwing objects around, even hitting serval of us across the face. That’s when they arrived.” \n\n“They? Who are they? You’ve alluded to another party before.” \n\n“The ones who watch, they look in on us from the outside, I think they were disappointed.” \n\n“I’m sorry but I’m not sure I follow?”\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t understand, you can’t. You’ll just discount this as the result of radiation poisoning, or a concussion like the rest do.” Dr Elizabeth Quinn December 9th 2004. \n\n“It wasn’t long after Ceres lost it that those things came, but no, no, I can’t, I can’t talk about it, they’ll know, they’ll come back.” Dr Marco Barlos October 17th 2001. \n\nNo further information is available about what happened during the incident, in all 9 of the 12 researchers died within a week, of the remaining 3 two are our survivors, and well, the other Dr. Ceres, was never found after the incident, seemingly having disappeared into thin air, leaving behind a journal full of illegible scrolling blue cursive writing.\n\nThe cite was demolished and paved over, later having a small garden center built over it. To this day reports of strange activity in the area continue, electronics acting oddly, the sound of distant muffled whispers, and some reports of ghostly blue flashes of light. \n\nIn the aftermath of the destruction of the facility, Plutus Robotics would step in paying for the majority of the damages, along with offering settlements to the survivors and families of the dead. Making the statement that \n\n“We in no way consider this a failure, merely a setback”. \n\n"},"876":{"title":"Creepy Kirby (lost media)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exfb86\/creepy_kirby_lost_media\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Substantial_Gap5760","selftext":"I remember looking through a gaming magazine when I was a young kid and seeing a creepy Kirby trying to eat king dedede but I’m not exactly sure what year or what game magazine it was but I must’ve read it around late 2000s to early 2010s and it really freaked me out when I was young and now I’m curious what it was exactly about and why make a lovable pink puff ball into a creepy creature \n\nDetail:he has a long tongue and I think a zombie like face, the background looked like a forest level "},"877":{"title":"There's something sinister at the end of the path","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exf40j\/theres_something_sinister_at_the_end_of_the_path\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"llapi1993","selftext":"Narration of this new creepypasta story. \n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/N-YUFfEy4rI"},"878":{"title":"EYELESS JACK : Rewritten Chapter 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exerk9\/eyeless_jack_rewritten_chapter_2\/","flair":"Iconpasta Story","author":"ThatDrbMaskiess","selftext":"Original By **Azelf5000**\n\nRewritten By [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ThatDrbMaskiess\/) &amp; [](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Breadfruit_Street\/)\n\n**\\~Quick notice - NathanH.\\~**\n\nWe are both fairly inexperienced writers and this is our first time doing an ambitious project like this together, and so we hope you can help us by giving criticism.

Since the last time I wrote here, nothing strange has happened, but we've actually started trying to find ways to make the costumes. My brother actually found an old robe. It was already black, so it was in the exact mentality we needed, but it wasn't the exact darkness we needed. It was a bit too light.\n\nOh, I forgot again—today is day 8. I have to remind myself to do this more often. It feels nice to write here. My brother has been a bit sadder than usual, but still, he's holding high spirits the best he can, the best all of us can since the loss of my sister.\n\nBut aside from that, everything has been going well. Dad got a raise at his job. Mom has been feeling better. In fact, she actually cooked yesterday. She made stir-fry pasta or noodles. I liked it. My brother didn't like it; he didn't like the vegetable part, to be specific. But aside from that, everything's been going perfectly normal.\n\nToday was a pretty good day. My dad bought some spray paint, and we went outside and spray-painted the coat. Dad's actually in support of our idea. He's a lot more lively than usual. I'm really happy to see him as his old self. Mom is also becoming better. She's a lot happier than usual. She's not energetic, but she actually has a genuine smile of happiness once in a while, and I'm happy to see that.\n\nEverything is actually going back to normal, except for a couple of things. It's probably nothing—probably just the tree branches against my window or just seeing things in the dark. The brain does that once in a while. But I've been seeing these shadows sometimes. It's probably just my brother going downstairs to get water, but it still has me a bit on edge.\n\nI did it again. I almost forgot to add what day it was—day 9. I'm about to go to bed. Hopefully, nothing strange happens. I'm still a bit nervous, but it's not that bad.\n\nDay 10: Today we finally got the costume done. I'm really happy with it. The mask is exactly how we envisioned it—a blue, oval-shaped mask with two eyes and no mouth. The black robe is finally done and dried. It fits perfectly with the hood on. My favorite part is when you put the hands together; it looks like they're connected. I took that inspiration from the Spanish Inquisition, or as my brother would say, it's not special; it's just an average cult thing. I tried to convince him, but he didn't really care. Well, at this point, I don't really care either. At least we have something we're working on.\n\nBut something has been going on. Once in a while, I hear things—like very light footsteps and sometimes, not scratching, but like someone's putting their hand on the wall and walking very slowly. As well, lights sometimes turn on and off, and doors sometimes creak slowly open and creak slowly shut. Sometimes they swing open and stay open, and then maybe an hour or sometime later, they just shut. But it's never the same door. It's always a new or different thing.\n\nDay 11: The electrician has come by to check out the lights, but he says nothing is wrong with them. The doors, he can't explain that. To be honest, I don't really know what's happening. I thought it could be the wind pushing the doors open, but the doors closing—I don't know about that. That, to me, is extremely strange.\n\nWe've actually started recording the movie today. I'm pretty excited. We've just started recording a couple of scenes, but aside from that, we haven't really filmed much. We've planned out the script though, and we have it fully done and ready. We're planning on recording more soon. We're playing the scenes out sometimes, but we haven't got the film yet because the battery for the camera is dead and it's still charging. It takes a little while—I don't know why it takes so long. Maybe the lights turning off and on is affecting the power. We'll have to call the electrician back.\n\nWe found out that a small mouse was chewing through the power lines. That's why the lights are flickering. But the strangest thing is, even after fixing them, the camera could charge but the lights still flicker, the doors still shut, and I'm starting to get really scared that there's something here. It's probably nothing—just my suspicion taking over. My parents keep telling me it's probably just my imagination. \"Nothing to worry about, kiddo,\" my dad tells me. \"Stop joking around,\" says my mother every time I bring any of this stuff up. \n\nThe strangest thing is, when nobody's home, this still happens. My brother and I were home one time while our parents went out to get groceries, and the doors shut, sometimes they creak open and creak shut. They shut loudly and close even quieter sometimes. The same for the lights—they still flicker. We sometimes check the attic to see if there are any mice chewing on wires. Nothing. At least the camera's charged though—that I'm excited for.\n\nDay 11 (continued): I'm really excited to start recording soon. I'll probably start recording tomorrow. I don't feel like it today since it's already getting late, but I can hear something in the corner of the house. I can barely hear it, like someone's hand being dragged against the wall. Not scratching with nails, but a very light hand against it.\n\nYou can also hear very faint footsteps. They're very hard to hear, but if you listen patiently and quietly, you'll hear them, as well as light switches being turned on and off. It's like someone is playing with them for fun—flicking them on for a little while, then off, then rapidly flicking them on and off, and then leaving them alone. The same for doors opening. Sometimes the stairs squeak like a mouse being stepped on. I don't know what's happening, but hopefully soon we'll start filming.\n\nI think my mom is right, and so is my father. This is all just my imagination.\n\nDay 12: Recently, I went back up to the attic to check what was going on, and I found something pretty interesting. There were small scratches around the outside of the attic window. It's a pretty big circular window. Something a bit more unnerving that I found is at the top there's a latch opening. When I opened the latch, I realized I could stick my head through it, and there was actually space for me to crawl out.\n\nBut there's nothing to hold on to or step onto. It's a risk, and I don't think anyone could crawl up from the bottom all the way to the third floor. It's a strange discovery, and I'm not sure what to make of it. I hope it's just the wind or something natural causing those scratches.\n\nTomorrow, I'll focus on the movie again and try to put this strange feeling aside."},"879":{"title":"Does anyone remember The Shadow Reader?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1excnar\/does_anyone_remember_the_shadow_reader\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"BFTROPguy1","selftext":"For those unaware, The Shadow Reader is a Creepypasta narrator who would ofc read Creepypastas, he was especially unique for not only reading creepypastas but also reviewing them after.\n\nFor the good creepypastas he would praise, for heavily flawed and bad stories he would go absolutely ballistic. \n\nI am not kidding, I don't know if he does this anymore but damn he does not hold back.\n\nJust seeing if anyone else remembers this channel."},"880":{"title":"My revenge on that one girl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1exbl0g\/my_revenge_on_that_one_girl\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Wooden-News8964","selftext":"So I was kinda ugly in school and there was this beautiful girl in school and I really liked her.

The feeling of being followed has only intensified. I’ve noticed it most when I’m walking home from work. I’ll catch glimpses of something in my peripheral vision—just a fleeting shadow or a dark shape that disappears when I turn my head. It’s making me paranoid.\n\nYesterday, I found a note slipped under my apartment door. It read, “You can’t hide from the dark.” The handwriting was jagged and uneven, and it gave me chills. I initially thought it was a prank or maybe a misunderstanding, but the note seems to amplify my fears. I’m jumpy all the time now. Even the hum of the refrigerator or the creak of the floorboards sends me into a panic. I’ve started avoiding the park altogether and even feel uneasy when I step outside during the day. I’m checking over my shoulder constantly, and my friends are beginning to notice that I’m not myself. I keep telling them I’m just stressed, but the truth is, I’m terrified.\n\n-END OF ENTRY-\n\n### **Police Case Report and Analysis: Michael Donovan Case**\n\n**Case Number:** #5847-2024**\n**Date:** June 19, 2024  \n**Officer:** Detective Laura Reynolds  \n**Location:** Crescent Avenue, Apartment 4B  \n**Subject:** Michael Donovan, Deceased\n\n---\n\n**Incident Overview:**\n\nMichael Donovan, a 32-year-old male, was found deceased in his apartment on June 16, 2024. The initial examination of the scene and subsequent autopsy report provided no definitive cause of death. There were no signs of forced entry, struggle, or trauma. Toxicology results were negative for any substances that could have led to a fatal outcome. The apartment showed no signs of disturbance beyond those consistent with regular habitation. The only significant findings were two handwritten diary entries discovered in a desk drawer, dated May 10, 2024, and May 20, 2024. These entries have since become a focal point in the investigation.\n\n**Analysis of Diary Entry 1 (May 10, 2024):**\n\nThe first diary entry describes an unsettling experience during a nighttime walk through a local park. Donovan recounts seeing a figure near a park bench, which vanished when he looked directly at it. He also expresses a pervasive feeling of being watched and a subsequent increase in anxiety and paranoia. This entry indicates that Donovan was likely under a significant amount of stress, possibly suffering from early signs of a mental health crisis, exacerbated by his perceived experiences.\n\n**Follow-Up Analysis of Diary Entry 2 (May 20, 2024):**\n\nThe second diary entry provides further insight into Donovan’s deteriorating mental state. He describes an escalating sense of paranoia and fear, specifically mentioning a shadowy figure that seemed to follow him. This entry also details the receipt of a threatening note that read, “You can’t hide from the dark,” which intensified his fear and anxiety.\n\nThe handwriting in this second entry is notably different from the first—it is shakier and more erratic, which could suggest that Donovan was writing under duress or in a state of heightened fear. The content suggests a belief that he was being stalked or pursued by an unknown entity, further supporting the hypothesis of a psychological breakdown.\n\nHowever, the absence of any physical evidence of an intruder or foul play, coupled with the coroner’s inconclusive findings, raises the possibility that Donovan’s fears were either entirely psychological or that they masked something more sinister that has yet to be uncovered.\n\n**Ongoing Investigation:**\n\nGiven the unsettling nature of the diary entries and the unexplained circumstances of Donovan’s death, the investigation remains open. The following steps are being taken:\n\n1. **Surveillance and Interviews:** Residents of the Crescent Avenue complex, particularly those in proximity to Donovan’s apartment, are being re-interviewed. Specific attention is being paid to any reports of unusual activity, disturbances, or sightings of unfamiliar individuals.\n\n2. **Park Surveillance:** Surveillance footage from the park Donovan frequently visited is being reviewed, focusing on the dates mentioned in the diary entries. Efforts are also being made to identify any individuals who may have been in the park during these times.\n\n3. **Forensic Re-evaluation:** A request has been made for a second forensic analysis of Donovan’s apartment, specifically looking for any evidence that may have been overlooked in the initial sweep. This includes a thorough examination of the note mentioned in the second diary entry, as well as any potential DNA or fingerprint evidence.\n\n4. **Psychological Profiling:** A psychological profile of Michael Donovan is being compiled based on the diary entries and interviews with friends, family, and colleagues. This profile aims to determine whether Donovan was experiencing a psychological disorder that could explain his perceptions and eventual death or if there is evidence to suggest an external influence or threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAt this stage, the case remains inconclusive. While the diary entries suggest a severe decline in Michael Donovan’s mental state, the lack of physical evidence of foul play leaves many questions unanswered. The investigative team is continuing to pursue all leads, including the possibility of a psychological cause of death, as well as the involvement of an unknown third party.\n\n**Report by:**  \n**Detective Laura Reynolds**  \n**Date:** June 19, 2024\n\n---\n\n### **Detective’s Personal Log: Case #5847-2024**\n\n**Date:** June 19, 2024  \n**Detective:** Laura Reynolds\n\nIt’s been a long day. The kind that lingers with you long after you’ve left the office, no matter how much you try to shake it off. I’ve been working this case for a few weeks now, but today something changed—something subtle, but undeniable.\n\nI started my day by revisiting Michael Donovan’s second diary entry. The language he used, the way he described his fear, it’s all too familiar. It’s as if I’ve read something like this before, only I can’t place it. The note he found under his door, “You can’t hide from the dark,” keeps playing in my mind. We see a lot of threats, a lot of messages designed to intimidate or scare, but this one feels different. There’s no demand, no reason, just pure malice. It’s unsettling.\n\nAfter I finished reading, I took another look at the scene photos from Donovan’s apartment. The place was neat, almost too neat. It didn’t fit with the level of paranoia he was describing in his diary. The blinds were half-open, letting in just enough light to cast shadows across the floor. The door locks were intact, no signs of forced entry. Everything seemed normal, but that’s what bothers me the most—nothing about this case is normal.\n\nI went back to the park where Donovan first felt like he was being watched. It was early morning this time, the sun barely above the horizon. The place was quiet, the only sounds were birds and the distant hum of traffic. I walked the same path he would have taken, stopping at the bench beneath the oak tree. I sat there for a while, trying to imagine what he must have felt. But all I could think about was how ordinary everything seemed. Just a park, just a bench, just a tree. But Donovan saw something more. Something that frightened him enough to change his routine, to make him start looking over his shoulder.\n\nI’ve been careful not to let this case get to me, but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t affecting me. I’m finding myself more on edge, more aware of my surroundings. It’s not fear, not exactly, but a kind of heightened awareness that I can’t switch off. Like I’m waiting for something to happen, even though I don’t know what it is.\n\nAfter leaving the park, I drove to Donovan’s workplace, hoping to find someone who might have noticed a change in him. His coworkers were polite but distant, like they didn’t want to get involved. One of them, a woman named Sarah, mentioned that Donovan had been acting strange in the last few weeks before his death. She said he was quieter than usual, more withdrawn. He’d stop talking in the middle of a sentence, like he’d forgotten what he was going to say, or as if he was listening to something no one else could hear.\n\nSarah mentioned one thing that stood out. She said that a few days before Donovan died, he was caught staring out the window for nearly an hour. When she asked him what he was looking at, he just shook his head and said, “Nothing. It’s gone now.” When I asked her what he might have meant by that, she shrugged and said, “He was always a bit of a daydreamer, but that was different. He looked… I don’t know, scared, I guess.”\n\nI made a note of it, but there’s nothing concrete to go on. Just more evidence that something was gnawing at him, something he couldn’t escape. I need more than that. I need facts, something I can hold on to.\n\nThis afternoon, I got a call from IT. They’d been trying to trace the number that sent Donovan the threatening message. No luck. It’s as if the number doesn’t exist. I’m not surprised, but it’s frustrating. Every lead seems to slip through my fingers like sand.\n\nI stopped by Donovan’s apartment building on the way back to the precinct. Mrs. Tanner, the elderly woman who lives down the hall from him, was out on her balcony. She waved me over, so I went to talk to her. She’s a sweet old lady, sharp as a tack, but I could tell she was nervous. She kept glancing over her shoulder like she was expecting someone to appear behind her.\n\nShe told me she’d been hearing strange noises at night. Footsteps in the hallway, but when she looked out, there was no one there. She also mentioned something else, something that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. She said she saw shadows moving under Donovan’s door, even when there was no light in his apartment. “Like they were alive,” she said. I didn’t know what to make of that, but I wrote it down. You never know what might end up being important.\n\nWhen I got back to the precinct, I reviewed everything again—the diary entries, the witness statements, the scene photos. It’s like trying to put together a puzzle with half the pieces missing. I know there’s something here, something just out of reach, but I can’t see it yet. And the longer this goes on, the more I start to wonder if I ever will.\n\nTonight, I’ll be going over Donovan’s personal effects again. There’s something in there, something I missed the first time. I can feel it. Maybe it’s just my imagination, or maybe it’s the case getting under my skin. Either way, I need to find out what happened to him. Because if I don’t, I’m afraid whatever it was might come after someone else. Or worse—maybe it’s already too late.\n\n**End of Log**"},"882":{"title":"Black Eyed Children: Top 3 Most Horrifying Real Tales of the Paranormal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ex5g8w\/black_eyed_children_top_3_most_horrifying_real\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"MileyTwerks83","selftext":"Are stories of the Black Eyed Children real?

We plan to bring much more to you all, and do our best to improve with the information you give us along the way. With all that out of the way we hope you enjoy this story.\n\n# Drb - Chapter 1 - Prelude\n\nI don't know why I'm forced to write in this stupid book my mother gave me, but since the death of my sister and that horrendous car crash that my mother can't seem to move on from, she's been trying to make us feel better or give us some sort of emotional place where we can just be ourselves. Frankly, I don't see the purpose of writing here, but I'll do it for the sake of her. I don't really know what to write in a journal, but I guess I'll just start off with who I am.\n\nMy name is Mitch. It is February 1992, in my opinion, the greatest time to be alive. My brother is Edwin, my father's name is Lucas, and my mother is Elizabeth. And then there was my sister, who sadly has passed on from this world, her name was Erica. I don't know the specifics on how she died. Mom didn't tell me the details, but all we know is it was a really bad car accident, something to do with swerving. All I can say is that mother hasn't been the same since she lost her first. We all miss Erica, but that's beside the point.\n\nMe and my brother Edwin have been recently trying out making some home movies. We don't have any ideas yet, but hopefully, we'll get something soon, something inspirational. I can feel it. He had an idea, something about Sci-Fi. I don't like that idea. Or some sort of Horror, and I like that one. But we're still trying to figure out what's going to be everything. Or maybe a fantasy. I don't know exactly what we're going to do, but we'll find something eventually we like. \n\nI just wonder now how I end a journal entry.\n\nToday is a pretty good day. Mother and Father went out to get some takeout since Mom didn't feel like cooking, with everything and all. We had pizza; it was pretty good. While we were eating, my brother had a pretty good idea. He decided to start the process of actually writing a script. When I asked him what it was going to be about, he said it was going to be like some horror flick. He didn't know exactly what it would be about. I questioned him about how he was writing a script without knowing what everything was. All he did was look at me and say, \"I'll figure it out.\"\n\nIt's 1:30 in the afternoon. Nothing new, but we are coming up with ideas, writing stuff down about ancient monsters and beings. We haven't really settled on a topic for our movie yet. It's going to be a horror one, and I'm pretty excited to make it with him. He's been feeling strange, or not really strange, just sad since the loss of our family member. We weren't close, but it's still sad.\n\nThis is my third day writing in this journal, and I'm kind of starting to warm up to it. We finally came up with a pretty good idea for our movie. It's about this cult. We don't know what they're going to wear exactly, but at least we have an idea down for once. We don't know what the cult is doing right now; we're just figuring out characters. But I'm hoping that it's going to be really cool. \n\nTo be honest, I'm starting to warm up to the idea of a horror flick. I was hoping we could do something different, but I kind of want to now. It's that weird feeling where you don't want to do something, and then you just warm up to it over time.\n\nDay Four: I really think I'm starting to get the hang of writing these journal entries. I think I'm going to try to list the days from now on, like Day One, Day Two, and so on. But that's beside the point.\n\nToday, we came up with how the cult is going to look. I was thinking about some robes, maybe like the Spanish Inquisition, so we settled on a cult with blue masks of some sort and long black robes. They look a lot like the ones plague doctors had but not exactly. They're a bit different and not made of leather—maybe some sort of heavy wool material. I think I can just spray paint Mother's shower robe for the movie, but I'll have to ask for her permission and get the spray paint. Not sure where to find it, but I could probably ask Dad.\n\nEverything's been looking up for us. Life has been actually good.\n\nToday, Mom and Dad got into an argument. They were yelling at each other. I don't know; I didn't hear the full thing, but all I caught from the top of the stairs was that they were blaming each other for the death of my sister. Mom was yelling at him, saying if only he hadn't gotten her a car. Dad yelled back, saying if only she didn't let her go out that night to have fun. \n\nBut all I thought was, how is this supposed to change our lives? At some point, I heard something—maybe Mom slapped Dad or hit him in some way. Dad left the house, not in a hurry, but walking out slowly before glaring at me. I quickly scrambled back up the stairs, almost tripping but getting back up quickly. He had a sad look in his eye—like guilt, sadness, and blame. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel bad for him, you know?\n\nOh, I almost forgot to write down the day: Day Five.\n\nNothing new today. Oh, I almost forgot it again—today is Day 6 of writing. Aside from that, nothing new. Dad still hasn't come back. I was a bit worried, so I asked Mom where he went. Mom said he was going to talk to his mom, so that means he's at Grandma's right now. I don't know exactly why—maybe he's dealing with something.\n\nI asked Mom, \"Will he be coming back anytime soon?\"\n\n\"I don't know, honey. Hopefully,\" she replied.\n\nLater that night, Dad came back. They had some heated discussion in the kitchen, but everything's okay now, thankfully. For food today, we had mac and cheese. It wasn't bad—Dad cooked, and I liked it.\n\nMe and my brother did a bit more brainstorming too. We still haven't come up with anything, you know, good in my opinion, but we're getting there eventually.\n\nDay Seven: Sometimes I feel like everyone in the house is distraught apart from me and my brother. The house feels not empty but dead since she left. Dad is sulking around on the couch most of the time. Mom is in the kitchen or anywhere else, God knows. Me and my brother are usually in our rooms, though he's in mine sometimes.\n\nDespite everything, we have really good ideas we're coming up with. So far, we don't know what the cult is doing, but at least we know what the cult looks like. In my opinion, that's a big step up. In my brother's opinion, he just says it's a minor imperfection. I always kept asking, \"What do you mean by that?\" He always just said, \"Well, some things can't be perfect in life, so we just got to work with what we're given.\" I like my brother; he has really good advice.\n\nToday was the funeral. Since then, he hasn't been the same. No, he's the same person, of course, he's just a lot more depressed. He sulks a lot more than usual. He's been trying to go back to his old self; it's kind of hard, though. Mom and Dad are just distraught, and I don't know how to help them. I wish I could. I wish I had my sister back."},"884":{"title":"EYELESS JACK : Rewritten, SOON!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ex3s3c\/eyeless_jack_rewritten_soon\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"ThatDrbMaskiess","selftext":"Hi so me and a friend have recently took an upon a project that we both have been wanting to do for a while we're planning on doing a Eyeless Jack rewrite we're both  writers are writing may be the best maybe the worst that's for your guy's judgment to decide but we think we're pretty good in our opinions of course but I'll be posting every chapter bit by bit "},"885":{"title":"THE DIVINE ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ex0swl\/the_divine\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"JEVIL0932","selftext":"August 2nd 1999-4:32pm\nReports in mid Western Europe of “blinding light” leaving 13 individuals completely blinded.

(Quite a few received the death penalty) However, A few managed to slip right through the fingers of law enforcement and found themselves slammed right into obscure infamy and ghastly, haunting legends. \n\nAs the years piled on the public eye has found itself engulfed in a sense of morbid curiosity so much so that online forums have even dedicated themselves to online sleuthing trying to solve these crimes and pinpoint potential suspects. armed with high hopes and amateur detective skills(at best) these communities have been bonded over the desire to accomplish what the police couldn’t. \n\nIf you scour online long enough you can certainly see the obsession over true crime practically spill from your monitor on to  your desktop. I for one have almost haphazardly dived directly into this rabbit hole myself. With minor consideration for the lengths some secrets consume the urge to stay buried.  One Phrase sums up the experience I’m hoping to unravel before you. “Abandon all hope, ye  who enter here”  \n\n\nPardon me for not introducing myself first, I have a tendency to focus on the wrong details, I’m Milo Morgan. I was born in North Carolina but raised here in upstate New York from the time I was 5. My venture into attempting detective work is rather new but it was sparked way back when I witnessed my neighbor miss jean’s house being broken into, and after trying to tell my parents who didn’t believe me, we found out that she was murdered that night the following morning. I was 7. \n\nMy therapist said “things like that have a way of sticking with you and if you don’t confront and conquer them they will shroud you in misery forever.” Followed by “it is your decision whether to embrace it and let it guide you positively or let it defeat you”   After years of therapy I gained an enormous sense of justice that led me to the New York State Police Academy. Unfortunately I’m not quite as athletic as was needed and I flunked out. Still over the years gave it two more shots as I had my sights set on becoming a detective. That journey started at 19 and Ended shortly after my 23rd  birthday when my father died. \n\nMy mother up and moved states away which led my siblings to spread across the country and it’s been hard to even keep track of where at this point. To occupy my mind and avoid grieving I once again set my sights on my dream of becoming a detective but without the proper channels. I obtained a Private Investigator license through the state allowing me to practice investigations.\n\nFollowing that, I spent years researching case files and explored various methods used by renowned detectives and forensic experts attempting to fine tune my sense of perception and intuition. After extensive grueling research I finally felt confident enough to join the ranks of the swivel chair sleuths and luckily for me I found a case that wasn’t too far from me in a rural town called Milton.\n\nThe Town itself was a peak sleepy community ironic being just a few hours away from the “city that never sleeps” with little warmth for those outside their quaint borders and farmland stretching from road to woodland basically throughout the town. Quite idyllic really during the days and almost like an entirely different place when the sun left the horizon and the moon began to peak through the dense branches. The scattered lighting looked like an army of pale lanterns guiding you through the town. Funny how the dark can disfigure and pervert such a beautiful sight in the light. \n\nBefore I headed out to the town I spent a few days going over the released files as the case went cold a year prior. It wasn’t much of a wonder as to how reviewing the large lack of evidence the police had. The victims name Mary Benton married to John Benton her body was discovered by local farmer Caleb Caruthers who was walking his hounds early morning at approximately 4:44 am. He stated to the sheriff that the previous night he swore he heard what sounded like screaming coming from the woods past his hayfield but chalked it up to the loud wind blowing that night. The officer who responded to the report gave a lengthy report detailing his opinion on the depravity of the murder but I’ll summarize the bullet points below \n\n\n* the body was found half clothed and the recovered clothes a short distance away looked like they were torn apart by an animal \n\n* the victims face was eviscerated almost to the point where no visual ID would be possible \n\n* there was many wounds that differed in size length and shape made to look like an animal maiming\n\n* there was internal organs ripped from the cadaver and thrown to the side a few were missing portions that the officer assumed were bitten \n\n* there were zero signs of Sexual Assault \n\n* no murder weapon was recovered from the scene or after a radial sweep of the area surrounding \n\n* a few of the wounds contained trace evidence of a venom like substance likely used to subdue the victim \n\n* The body was moved from the original place of death judging by the lack of blood surrounding the body. \n\nWhile reading this report I cannot express enough the sickening feeling I felt in my gut and the chills that continued throughout my body the further I read. \nThere were photos taken  of  the crime scene that were redacted by the sheriff due to the severity of the incident. Which was a huge loss in terms of potential evidence. After three days of going back and forth between the files witness accounts and statements. I was fully invested in trying to solve this crime. And set out to the Town of Milton to get started on my investigation. \n\nDay one: \nI arrived in town around 5 am just as the sun began to rise revealing the scene I described earlier. Pictures online barely do its majesty any justice. I approached the sheriff’s department with intentions to speak to the sheriff who signed off on the reports. To my surprise there was barely a soul in town and even when I walked into the building there was only a single person posted at the desk. She said she was the dispatcher and her name was Shannon Garrison. \n\nThe conversation went as follows \n\n“Good Morning, Ma’am, My name is Milo Morgan. I was Hoping to speak with Sheriff Marley if at all possible”  she responded “ Morning, Sheriff ain’t in today, at least not yet. What business you got with the Sheriff?”\n\nVisibly disappointed I responded back “ I’m a private investigator I came up here to discuss a cold case from a year or so ago I-“ \n\nshe stopped me mid sentence “ oh another kook trying to uncover the mysterious murders round here!?” “ I doubt the Sheriff wants anything to do with talking to you at all” \n\nI attempted to interrupt “ miss I don’t want any trouble I’m just here to try and help and possibly give the victims family some peace and closure” she retorted more aggressively \n “ the folks around here have been through more than enough and are trying to move forward after all this mayhem, so go on and find something else to occupy your time young man” \n\nI chuckled in my head being that we were probably the same age \n“ okay, I’m sorry to disturb you, and not to be pushy but I’m not leaving without at least talking to the Sheriff.”\n\nAlmost exhaustedly she said “ fine, have it your way. He’ll be here tomorrow morning 6 am sharp”  till then there a motel down the road a few miles I suggest you get a room and stay in it till then” \n\nA little ego boosted from the conversation going my way I left the building excited, I began to head towards the Motel. Suddenly there was this looming question that started spiraling In the forefront of my head. I could have sworn she said Murders…. \n\n\n\nEnd Of Day 1:\nI arrived at the Motel and was greeted by the receptionist a well mannered man who (like most of us) seemed like a dreamer he seemed preoccupied by his own thoughts but promptly checked me in and took to room 111. There were many vacant rooms so, it just felt odd to be placed directly in the middle of the Motel with a direct view from the window of the road and across the street a farm practically could see into the house. I began to write down the details of today’s events. Not that there were many. But by the end I was left with three distinct questions I definitely needed answered. \n\n1. Why is the town so empty ?\n2. Where is the sheriff on a weekday?\n3. Was there more than one Murder \/ how many more?\n\nI will provide further updates tomorrow. \n"},"887":{"title":"Not all duvets protect you from monsters","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewz617\/not_all_duvets_protect_you_from_monsters\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I was in a bed shop to look for a new bed and I went with my 2 friends. I needed a new bed as my old bed was losing its touch. The main thing my bed was losing, was its protection capability when I hid under it when monsters attacked.

We were rating them based on their quality and comfort, and especially their protection capability from monsters. Then the screams started and it started getting louder. We could then hear the monsters attacking the bed shop. It was scary but a calm thought cane across our minds when we realised that we were in a bed shop. We had so many beds to hide under its duvets. The monsters were ravaging the people inside the bed shop and one of my friends hid under a duvet of an expensive bed. \n\nThen my friend that hid under the expensive duvet started to scream. He wanted to get out but couldn't find a way out. The both of us couldn't find a way to get my friends. I looked around and I could see that some of the duvets were traps themselves to hurt the person sleeping in the bed, this was so bad. How were we to know which duvet was good or bad? Also why would a bed shop owner create duvets that attack and kill the people sleeping on them. \n\nThe duvets that were safe to hide under, the person under it were to selfish to share as it would reduce the protection capability. Then I go a flash back from when I was a child. I was hiding under a duvet but I could still feel the attacks from the monster attacking my house. Then I realised that there was no monster but rather my physically abusive father pretending to be one. Duvets protect against monsters and not humans. Any how I came back to reality and me and my friends had to take a chance of hiding under duvet. \n\nThere was a chance the duvet would hurt us or protect us. I chose a duvet and so did my friend, my friend started screaming as his duvet started killing him. I was listening to it all as my duvet was protecting me.

I’m out of options, and I’m scared for her.\n\n\n\nPlease, if anyone has any advice or can offer any insight, I’m all ears.\n\n\n\nI have redacted our emails.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Subject:** Made it to the End of the Earth\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 19, 2024, 6:15 PM\n\n\n\nHey John,\n\n\n\nI finally made it! After what felt like an eternity of flights and a bumpy ride on a snowcat, I’m officially at the North Pole. The facility is...well, let’s just say it’s not exactly cozy, but it’ll do. It’s so quiet out here, it’s almost unsettling. The wind is constant, and there’s this never-ending white landscape in every direction. I swear, it feels like I’ve landed on another planet.\n\n\n\nThere’s barely any phone service here—actually, none at all. The internet is spotty, but I’m hoping it’ll be reliable enough to keep in touch with you. I already miss hearing your voice, but at least we can still email. I’ll send pictures when the connection is stable enough.\n\n\n\nI’ve got a ton of unpacking and setup to do, so I’ll keep this short for now. Just wanted to let you know I’m here and thinking of you.\n\n\n\nTalk soon.\n\n-Alice\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Re: Made it to the End of the Earth\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 19, 2024, 8:30 PM\n\n\n\nHey Babe,\n\n\n\nI’m so excited for you! It’s amazing that you’re finally there and getting to experience something so few people ever will. I can’t even imagine what it must be like to see that endless expanse of snow and ice in person. I’m already proud of you, but this just takes it to a whole new level.\n\n\n\nI know it’s not the most comfortable place in the world, but I’m sure you’ll make the best of it. I’m just glad you made it safely. Please stay safe out there—those conditions are no joke, and I need you to come back in one piece!\n\n\n\nWhere are you staying, by the way? What’s the setup like? I’m picturing some tiny, cozy cabin, but I’m sure it’s more like a research facility, right? Give me all the details when you can, and let me know what your daily routine will be like. I want to picture what your days will be like out there.\n\n\n\nCan’t wait to hear more from you. And remember, if you need anything, I’m just an email away.\n\n\n\nMiss you already.\n\n-John\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Re: Made it to the End of the Earth\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 20, 2024, 7:45 AM\n\n\n\nI’m seriously the luckiest girl to have someone like you rooting for me. It means so much to know you’re excited for me, even from so far away. I promise I’ll stay safe and come back with plenty of stories to tell.\n\n\n\nAs for my setup here, you were half right—it’s more research facility than cozy cabin. The facility is pretty basic, just a few small rooms for sleeping, working, and eating. It’s not much to look at, but it’s functional. My daily routine so far will be pretty boring: waking up early, running some preliminary tests, logging data, and trying to stay warm! I’ve got a lot of downtime, which I’m sure will change once I get into the swing of things.\n\n\n\nBut here’s the exciting part—I’m heading out to a remote cabin tomorrow! I’ll be there for a week, completely on my own, to collect data and monitor some specific environmental conditions. It’s a job that not many people get to do, which is why I’m both nervous and excited. The cabin is about 20 miles from here, totally isolated, and I’ll have to snowmobile there. It’s going to be just me, my equipment, and the great white wilderness.\n\n\n\nIt’s a little intimidating to think about being out there by myself, but at the same time, it’s such a rare opportunity. I can’t wait to get started, though I’ll definitely miss having contact with the outside world. I’ll try to email you whenever I get a signal, but it might be even spottier than here.\n\n\n\nI’ll let you know how it goes once I’m settled in the cabin. Wish me luck!\n\n\n\nMiss you tons.\n\n-Alice\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Re: Made it to the End of the Earth\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 20, 2024, 9:15 AM\n\n\n\nI’ve got to admit, the idea of you being out there all alone in that remote cabin has me a little worried. I know you’re more than capable, but the thought of you isolated in the middle of all that ice and snow...well, just promise me you’ll be extra careful, okay? I’d feel a lot better knowing you’re keeping an eye out for any unexpected visitors—like, say, an abominable snowman! ;)\n\n\n\nAll jokes aside, it really is amazing that you’re getting to do this. I’m proud of you for taking on such a unique challenge, even if it does make me a little nervous. Just make sure you’ve got everything you need, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything—even if it’s just a virtual hug. I’ll be thinking of you every day and counting down the hours until I hear from you again.\n\n\n\nGood luck out there, and keep in touch as much as you can. You’ve got this!\n\n\n\nMiss you too.\n\n-John\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Made it to the cabin\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 21, 2024, 6:30 PM\n\n\n\nI’m all settled in at the “cabin,” though calling it a cabin is a bit of a stretch—it’s more like a small facility, but with a much comfier bed and a little more space than the main research station. It’s still pretty basic, but at least I won’t feel like I’m living in a closet for the next week!\n\n\n\nThe trip out here on the snowmobile was something else. The further we got from the main facility, the more nervous I started to feel. The landscape just stretches on and on, with nothing but snow and ice as far as the eye can see. It’s beautiful, but in a way that makes you feel very, very small.\n\n\n\nWhen we finally arrived, Nick, the guy who drove me out here, helped unload my groceries and bags. He’s one of the technicians at the main facility, responsible for maintenance and keeping everything running smoothly. After unloading, he gave me a quick rundown of the essentials—how to operate the generator, what to do if the power goes out, how to radio for help in an emergency—and then...he left. Watching him drive away was surreal—this sinking feeling hit me hard as I realized how truly alone I am out here. It’s just me, the cabin, and miles of snow in every direction. The silence is so intense that it almost feels loud, if that makes any sense.\n\n\n\nIt’s only the first day, but I already feel so isolated. I’ve never been this far from civilization before, and it’s going to take some getting used to. I’m sure I’ll be fine once I get into the routine of things, but right now, it’s a little overwhelming.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I’m going to try and get some sleep. I’ll email you again tomorrow if the connection holds. Miss you more than ever.\n\n-Alice  \n\n\n**Subject:** Re: Made it to the Cabin\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 21, 2024, 8:45 PM\n\n\n\nI can only imagine how surreal it must be to see nothing but snow and ice for miles around. It sounds both incredible and a little overwhelming, but I know you’ll adjust in no time. You’re one of the strongest people I know, and I have no doubt you’ll make the most of this experience.\n\n\n\nI’m glad you’ve got Nick to make sure everything’s in working order before he left. And hey, at least you’ve got the radio if anything goes wrong! Just make sure you don’t lose it—I don’t want you having to trek through the snow to chase down a signal! ;)\n\n\n\nSeriously though, I’m here for you. I know it’s tough being so isolated, but just remember that this is temporary, and you’re going to come out of this with some amazing stories and accomplishments. I’m so proud of you for taking on this challenge, even if it means being so far away for a bit.\n\n\n\nGet some rest, and keep in touch as much as you can. I’m always just an email away.\n\n\n\nMiss you tons.\n\n-John  \n\n\n**Subject:** A Rough First Night\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 22, 2024, 6:00 PM\n\n\n\nI wish I could be as lighthearted as you, but I’ve got to be honest—I’m really scared. Last night was rough, to say the least. I barely got any sleep. The noises...they were constant. I know it’s probably just the wind, but it was like something was scraping against the walls, and every now and then, I’d hear this low, distant sound that almost sounded like...I don’t know, like a voice or a moan. I kept telling myself it was just the wind, but it didn’t stop me from feeling terrified.\n\n\n\nI’m exhausted today, running on barely any sleep. And to make things worse, I’ve started noticing little things going missing or turning up in places I’m sure I didn’t leave them. My notebook, for example—I know I left it on the table, but I found it on the floor across the room this morning. Same with my gloves. I thought I left them by the door, but they were in the kitchen when I got up. I keep trying to convince myself that it’s just the isolation getting to me, that I’m just tired and maybe not remembering where I put things. But it’s hard not to feel like something’s off.\n\n\n\nI’m trying to stay focused on the work and keep myself busy, but it’s hard when every little sound or misplaced object sets my nerves on edge. I’m sorry for not being more upbeat, but I’m really struggling right now.\n\n\n\nI hope tonight will be better. I’ll try to sleep more, but I’m not sure how easy that’s going to be.\n\n\n\nMiss you so much.\n\n-Alice\n\n\n\n**Subject:** John, I’m Terrified\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 23, 2024, 12:05 AM\n\n\n\nI’m freaking out right now. I can barely type this, but I need to tell you what just happened.\n\n\n\nIt’s midnight here, and I was lying in bed, trying to sleep, when I heard something outside. At first, it was just the sound of snow crunching, like footsteps, but it got closer and closer until it was right outside my window. I was too scared to move, too scared to even breathe. The blinds were closed, thank god, but I could feel it...whatever it was, standing there. Just standing there, right outside my window.\n\n\n\nIt stayed there for what felt like an hour, not moving, just...watching. I wanted to look, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I don’t know what it was, but the thought of seeing it through the window paralyzed me. After what felt like an eternity, I heard it slowly start to walk away, the snow crunching under its feet again. But it didn’t just leave. It walked away slowly, then I heard it stop again, like it turned around. I didn’t hear anything after that.\n\n\n\nI waited, trying to calm down, trying to convince myself it was just an animal or something. But when I finally worked up the courage to get out of bed and grab the radio to call for help...it wasn’t where I left it. I’m positive I left it on the nightstand, right next to me, but it’s gone. I’ve looked everywhere I can think of, but it’s just...gone. I feel like I’m losing my mind.\n\n\n\nI’m terrified, John. I don’t know what to do. I’ve emailed the facility too, but I haven’t gotten a reply yet. I’m trying to stay calm, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is really, really wrong. I need you to reply as soon as you get this. I don’t know what else to do.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Re: John, I’m Terrified\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 23, 2024, 8:45 AM\n\n\n\nI just read your email, and my heart sank. I can’t believe you had to go through that alone—I’m so sorry. As soon as I saw your message, I called the research company ARI, demanded that they send someone out to you right away. At first, they just said they’d “look into it,” but I didn’t back down. I made it clear that this is an emergency and that you need help now. They finally agreed to send someone to check on you.\n\n\n\nI’m furious that they didn’t take this seriously from the start, but I’ve been assured that someone is on their way. Please hang in there, Alice. I know you’re scared, but you’re not alone in this. Help is coming.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, I need you to stay as calm as possible. I know that’s easier said than done, but panicking won’t help. If you can, try to find the radio. It’s got to be somewhere close. Maybe the stress and exhaustion are playing tricks on your mind, making you misplace things. I know it’s hard to believe right now, but just focus on finding that radio so you can get in touch with the facility directly.\n\n\n\nI’m here for you, Alice. I’m going to stay by my phone and email all day, waiting for any updates from you or the company. We’re going to get through this together.\n\n\n\nPlease, please stay safe. I’m counting the minutes until I hear from you again.\n\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n**Subject:** I Don’t Know What’s Happening\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 23, 2024, 10:20 PM\n\n\n\nI don’t even know where to begin. I’ve spent the entire day searching for that damn radio. I was so desperate to find it, I completely neglected my work, just tearing the cabin apart and retracing my steps over and over again. Every time I thought I might’ve overlooked a spot, I’d go back and search it again, convinced that I must’ve just missed it.\n\n\n\nHours, John. I wasted hours searching, obsessing, when I should’ve been doing my research. And then, after all that time, I came back to the cabin, utterly defeated, and there it was—sitting on my nightstand, right where I left it. But it wasn’t just there...it was cold and wet, like it had been outside in the snow all night and day. How is that even possible? How could it end up back where I left it, after I searched everywhere?\n\n\n\nI was so relieved to find it, I didn’t even care how strange it was. I just wanted to get in touch with the facility, to tell them what’s been happening. I turned it on, and for a moment, I thought things were going to be okay. The radio worked, and I managed to get through to the facility. But just as I started talking, the speaker gave out. The whole thing shut off and died right in the middle of my sentence. I couldn’t believe it.\n\n\n\nI don’t know what’s happening to me, John. I feel like I’m going crazy. After everything today—the hours I wasted searching, only to find the radio where it should’ve been, and then to have it break on me—I just...I couldn’t take it. I sat on the bed and sobbed for what felt like hours. I don’t know what else to do. I’m scared, I’m confused, and I’m starting to doubt my own mind.\n\n\n\nAm I losing it? Is this the isolation, or is something really wrong here? I don’t know how much more of this I can take.\n\n\n\nPlease, John, I need you to help me make sense of this. I feel like I’m slipping away.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** John, It’s Back\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 23, 2024, 10:32 PM\n\n\n\nI still haven’t heard back from the facility. Have you heard anything else from Arctic Research Initiatives? Did they say someone was coming? I’m starting to get really worried.\n\n\n\nI’m typing this right now, and I can hear it again—that sound. The snow crunching outside my window, just like last night. It’s getting closer, and I can’t bring myself to turn around. I’m staring at the screen, but I can feel it standing there, right outside the window.\n\n\n\nThere’s a mirror next to the desktop, and I’m using it to get a look without actually turning around. Oh god, John, it’s there. It’s standing at the window again, just like before. The blinds are messed up, and I can see it through a sliver—a single eye, looking right at me. It looks like an animal’s eye, but the shape of its head...it’s like a deformed human head. I don’t know what it is, but it’s just staring at me.\n\n\n\nI keep checking the mirror, hoping it’ll leave, but the sound...it’s getting louder. I thought it was walking away, but it’s not. It’s getting closer, and the figure in the mirror isn’t moving. Oh god...there’s another one. I can see it at the other window now, across from the first one. There are two of them, just standing there, watching me.\n\n\n\nA few seconds after the second one appeared, they both walked away together, in unison. I can’t take this anymore. I’m so frustrated and scared, but I can’t just sit here and do nothing.\n\n\n\nI just ran outside to yell at whatever it was to leave me alone. But there’s nothing out here—just the wind and snow. The only thing left are the footprints leading away from the cabin.\n\n\n\nI’m exhausted, John. I’m going to try to get some sleep if my mind will let me. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.\n\n\n\nPlease, please respond as soon as you can.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Hang in There, Alice\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 24, 2024, 8:30 AM\n\n\n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’ve been trying to get in touch with someone at ARI all morning. I called again, but no one answered. When I finally got through to someone, they put me on hold—for hours. I’m getting really angry about this, and I’ve forwarded our emails to the company, demanding that they take this seriously and send help immediately.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, I want you to try and stay as calm as possible. I know it’s hard, but I need you to focus on something positive. Do you remember that weekend we spent at the cabin by the lake? The one where we stayed up all night watching the stars, talking about cartoons we grew up watching? I want you to think about that, about how peaceful and safe it felt. Hold onto that memory, okay?\n\n\n\nWhatever it is that you’re seeing out there, it’s probably just a curious animal. I know it’s scary, but you’re going to be okay. Help is coming—I won’t stop until I’m sure of it. We’re going to get through this, and one day, we’ll be sitting together, laughing about how this made for one hell of a story. I promise.\n\n\n\nI love you, Alice. Just hold on a little longer. We’re going to get through this together.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Are You Okay?\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 24, 2024, 4:15 PM\n\n\n\nI haven’t heard back from you, and I’m getting really worried. Are you okay? Did you get my last email? Please let me know as soon as you see this. I’m sitting by my computer, waiting for your reply.\n\n\n\nI love you, Alice. I’m not going anywhere until I hear from you.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** I Did Something Stupid\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 24, 2024, 6:30 PM\n\n\n\nI’m sorry I didn’t respond earlier. I did something stupid today, and I don’t know what I was thinking, but I just couldn’t sit here doing nothing anymore. I needed answers.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t snow much last night, so the footprints were still visible this morning. I decided to follow them, to see where they led. I know it was dumb, but I had to know what—or who—was out there.\n\n\n\nI must’ve walked for three or four hours, John. The prints just kept going, on and on, with no sign of stopping. Every time I thought about turning back, I’d convince myself that I was getting closer to something, to some kind of explanation. But they never stopped. They just kept going, straight into the endless white.\n\n\n\nAt some point, I realized how far I’d gone and how isolated I was. The fear started to creep in again, and I finally turned back. It was terrifying out there, just me and those footprints, and the realization that I could have gotten lost or worse hit me hard.\n\n\n\nBy the time I got back to the cabin, I was exhausted, both physically and mentally. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself out there in the snow, chasing after something that I’m not even sure is real. I don’t know what’s happening to me, John. I don’t know if it’s the isolation or something else, but I’m scared.\n\n\n\nI’m back inside now, but I feel like I’m being pulled apart. I don’t know what to do.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Don’t Worry Anymore\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 24, 2024, 7:30 PM\n\n\n\nIt’s okay now. I see everything clearly. You don’t need to worry anymore. I’m where I’m supposed to be.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** What’s Going On?\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 24, 2024, 8:00 PM\n\n\n\nAlice,\n\n\n\nI’m really confused right now. Why did you think it was a good idea to wander off like that? You’re smarter than that, and you know how dangerous it is out there. What’s going on with you? Your last email was...weird, to say the least. Are you okay? You don’t sound like yourself.\n\n\n\nI finally managed to get through to someone at ARI, and I’m going to their building tomorrow morning to meet with a few people. I’m going to make sure they do something, whatever it takes.\n\n\n\nPlease, just tell me what’s going on. I’m really worried about you.\n\n-John\n\n\n\n**Subject:** I’m So Scared, John\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 25, 2024, 6:45 AM\n\n\n\nI just woke up and saw your last message, and I’m so confused. I don’t remember writing that weird email I sent you last night. I checked my sent folder, and there it was, clear as day, but I don’t even remember typing it. I’m scared, John. I feel like I’m losing my mind, and I don’t know what’s real anymore.\n\n\n\nLast night was the worst yet. I heard the footsteps again, but this time they didn’t stop at the window. They circled the cabin, over and over, like they were trying to wear me down. After they finally stopped, I was so exhausted that I crawled into bed, hoping to sleep it off.\n\n\n\nI only managed a couple of hours before I woke up—no, more like faded awake. And that’s when I saw it. John, there was something in my cabin. A black figure standing on two legs, but it wasn’t human. I could only make out its outline in the darkness, but it looked like a deformed human head with the left side of its forehead caved in, like something had scooped part of it out. It was too tall for the cabin, its neck cranked to the side as it stood there. Its arms were so long they fell to the ground beside its feet, and it had these deer antlers growing upside down from its head, forming almost a circle around the base of its skull. Its legs bent backward like an animal’s.\n\n\n\nI just stared at it, too terrified to move, for what felt like hours. I didn’t even blink. But when I finally did, it was gone, like it had never been there. I haven’t slept since—I’ve been sitting here, sobbing, trying to convince myself that it was just a nightmare. But it felt so real, John. I know what I saw.\n\n\n\nI have to keep reminding myself that there are only two days left. Just two more days, and then I’ll be out of here. I’m trying to hold on, but I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I just want to be with you, in your arms, where I feel safe. I love you so much, John. Please, just get me out of here.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** John, Please Respond\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 25, 2024, 6:10 PM\n\n\n\nJohn,\n\n\n\nI’m starting to get really worried. I haven’t heard back from you all day. Please, please respond as soon as you can. I don’t know what I’d do if something happened to you. I need to know you’re okay.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to distract myself with work, but it’s getting harder and harder. Sometimes, I can focus for a while, but I always end up with this overwhelming feeling that I should just run. It’s like something is telling me that running into the snow, even with the risk of dying out there, would be better than staying here. I don’t know why I feel this way, but it’s terrifying.\n\n\n\nThe sun is going down now, and I know those things will be back. I can feel it. I’ve done everything I can to try to protect myself. I’ve barricaded the door with the dresser, flipped my desk on its side to cover one window, and used my mattress to block the other. I feel like a complete maniac, but I’ve never been more scared in my life.\n\n\n\nPlease, John, just let me know you’re okay. I need to hear from you.\n\n\n\nI love you.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** John, Please Don’t Leave Me Alone\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 26, 2024, 7:00 AM\n\n\n\nJohn,\n\n\n\nI still haven’t heard from you, and I don’t know what to do. This is the most isolated I’ve ever felt in my life. I feel like I’m never going to get out of here. Please, John, if you’re reading this, I need you to respond. I need to know you’re there.\n\n\n\nThe barricades kept me from seeing whatever was out there last night, but it didn’t stop them. They started tapping on the windows. It wasn’t loud—just this constant, rhythmic tapping, like they were reminding me they were still there. It went on all night, John. They didn’t stop until the first light of dawn, and then, just like before, they walked away.\n\n\n\nI’m terrified, John. It’s the last day, and I’m so close to the end, but I don’t know if I can make it. I need you to tell me I’m going to be okay. I need some kind of encouragement because all I want to do right now is run. It’s like the fear is eating away at me, telling me to just run and never look back.\n\n\n\nPlease, John, please respond. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.\n\n\n\nI love you.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** I Can Hear You\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 26, 2024, 3:30 PM\n\n\n\nJohn,\n\n\n\nIt’s afternoon now, and I still haven’t heard from you. I’m trying to stay calm, but it’s getting harder. I’ve been watching those creatures all day—they’re standing just out of view, far enough away that the wind picks up the snow and gives them some cover. But I know they’re there. They’ve been there since this morning, just waiting.\n\n\n\nI keep telling myself that this nightmare will be over soon. I should be getting picked up early tomorrow, and I can finally leave this place behind. I can almost hear you calling my name in the wind, John. It’s strange—the voice gets louder as the wind picks up, almost like I can really hear you. It’s comforting in a way, like you’re here with me, keeping me company.\n\n\n\nI’m feeling better knowing that tomorrow I’ll be out of here. I decided to go for a walk, just to get out of the cabin for a bit and clear my head. Don’t worry, I won’t go far this time. I just need to feel the air and remind myself that I’m still alive, that this will end soon.\n\n\n\nI’ll be back in soon and will email you again. I love you, John. Please respond when you can.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Ready to Go\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 26, 2024, 7:15 PM\n\n\n\nEverything is packed and ready to go. I’m just waiting to be picked up tomorrow morning. I should be relieved, right? But something’s happening, and I don’t know how to explain it.\n\n\n\nWhile I’m writing this, I can hear my mom calling my name. It’s clear, John—so clear that I can’t ignore it. She’s out there, somewhere in the snow, and she’s calling for me. I have to find her before the cold or those things get to her. I can’t just stay here and wait. It’s too late for that.\n\n\n\nI’m taking some supplies with me, and I’m heading out to find her. I know it sounds crazy, but I have to do this. I have to find her before it’s too late.\n\nI’ll be back before morning. I promise.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Alice, Please\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 26, 2024, 8:00 PM\n\n\n\nI need you to listen to me—please don’t go looking for your mom. I know you think you’re hearing her, but it’s probably just your mind playing tricks on you, like it has been ever since you got there. I’m begging you to stay put and wait for your pickup tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI’m sorry I haven’t been able to respond until now. Something happened, and I don’t know how to explain it, but I think ARI is hiding something. After I kept pushing them for answers, they had the cops come after me. They arrested me for a couple of days, supposedly for “interfering with their operations.” I don’t know what’s really going on, but it’s clear they didn’t want me asking too many questions or getting involved. I’ve been trying to get to you, but they’ve been doing everything they can to keep me out of the loop.\n\n\n\nI finally got out, and I’m doing everything I can to reach you. But you have to stay safe, Alice. Whatever you’re hearing, whatever you think is out there, it’s not real. The stress, the isolation—it’s all been messing with your mind. Just hold on a little longer. I promise you’ll be out of there soon, and we’ll figure all of this out together.\n\nPlease, Alice, don’t leave the cabin. Wait for your pickup. We’re almost there.\n\n\n\nI love you more than anything, and I’m not going to let anything happen to you.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Alice, Are You Safe?\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 27, 2024, 7:30 AM\n\n\n\nI’m really starting to worry. You didn’t respond to my last message, and I need to know if you’ve been picked up yet. Are you safe? Please, just send me a quick reply to let me know you’re okay.\n\n\n\nI really hope you didn’t go looking for your mom. It doesn’t make any sense for her to be out there, and I’m sure you know that deep down. I understand how stressed and scared you’ve been, but that would be crazy, Alice. The isolation and fear have been playing tricks on you, and I need you to recognize that.\n\n\n\nPlease, just tell me you’re safe and that everything is okay. I can’t stop thinking about you, and I’m going out of my mind with worry.\n\n\n\nI love you, Alice. Please, respond as soon as you see this.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Alice, Please Answer Me\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 27, 2024, 9:45 AM\n\n\n\nIt’s been hours, and I still haven’t heard from you. I’m begging you—please let me know if you’re okay. I can’t take this silence anymore. I need to know you’re safe.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to get through to the company, but no one is picking up. And now they’ve trespassed me from the building, so I can’t even go there to get answers. I’m completely shut out, and I don’t know what to do.\n\n\n\nI did some digging, and it turns out ARI has some pretty shady connections to the government. That would explain how they were able to have me arrested so easily. I don’t know what they’re hiding, but something about this whole situation isn’t right.\n\n\n\nPlease, Alice, just send me a message—anything—to let me know you’re okay. I’m terrified that something’s happened to you, and I can’t just sit here and do nothing.\n\n\n\nI love you, and I’m not going to stop until I know you’re safe.\n\n\n\n**Subject:** I’ll Never Give Up\n\n**From:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**To:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**Date:** August 28, 2024, 10:00 AM\n\n\n\nIt’s been a day, and I still haven’t heard from you. I don’t know what’s going on, and I’m scared out of my mind, but I’m holding on to hope that you’re okay. Wherever you are, I hope you’re safe.\n\n\n\nI just want you to know that I love you more than anything, and I’ll never stop looking for you. No matter what it takes, I won’t give up until I find you and bring you home.\n\n\n\nPlease, if you see this, let me know you’re alright. I’m not giving up on you, Alice. I never will.\n\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI stared at my computer screen, the cursor blinking back at me like it was mocking my helplessness. I had sent my final email to Alice, pouring out everything I had left in me, but the silence that followed was unbearable. It’s been days since her last message, and with every hour that goes by without a response, my fear deepens. I know something is terribly wrong, but I have no way of reaching her, no way of knowing what has happened.\n\n\n\nAfter being shut out by ARI and finding no answers in my research, I feel trapped in a nightmare I can’t escape.\n\nThe company’s shady government connections, my unexpected arrest, and the eerie silence from Alice all point to something much darker than I ever imagined. I’ve exhausted every option available to me, but I refuse to give up.\n\n\n\nI received this email from someone claiming to be Alice. I know it's not her because she never types like this. She always had so much personality even in email, but this, this sounds like a robot. Here's the last email:\n\n\n\n**Subject:** A Difficult Decision\n\n**From:** \\[Alice Harper\\]\n\n**To:** \\[John Matthews\\]\n\n**Date:** August 30, 2024, 3:15 PM\n\n\n\nI’ve made a decision, and it’s not an easy one. I’ve accepted a position that will keep me out here much longer than we originally planned. It’s a great opportunity, and I feel that it’s the right choice for me.\n\n\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think it’s best that we end our relationship. The distance is too much, and I don’t think it’s fair to either of us to keep things going. I’m sorry for the silence, but I needed time to think about what was best for both of us.\n\n\n\nI hope you have a great life, John.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe words on the screen were supposedly from Alice, but I knew immediately that they weren’t hers. This wasn’t the woman I loved. Alice would never do something like this—breaking up with me over email, especially after not responding for days. It just didn’t make sense.\n\n\n\nAlice was thoughtful, careful with her words, and always considerate of my feelings. She would never leave me hanging like this, especially not when things were so tense and uncertain. No, this wasn’t her. Someone else was pretending to be her, trying to make me believe she had just moved on.\n\n\n\nBut I’m not buying it. I know Alice better than that. I know her heart, and this cold, robotic message wasn’t it. Something happened to her out there, something they don’t want me to know about. But I’m not giving up. I won’t stop until I find out what really happened to Alice—no matter how far I have to go or what I have to do.\n\n\n\nThey can try to silence me, but they won’t succeed. I’ll find Alice, or at least I’ll find out what happened to her. And I’ll make sure the truth comes out, no matter what."},"889":{"title":"I, a vampires...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewx9qo\/i_a_vampires\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\nI woke up with a chill down my spine, something I had never felt before. My eyes slowly opened, and the first thing I saw was the white, sterile ceiling of an unfamiliar place. I tried to move, but my body was stiff, heavy, as if it no longer responded to my commands. A sharp pain shot through my head, and suddenly, I remembered the car accident. The last thing I recalled was the sound of screeching tires and the brutal impact against something. Everything after that became a blur.\n\nAs my vision adjusted, I realized I was lying on some kind of metal gurney. The strong smell of chemicals and the echo of silence made me understand where I was: a morgue. My heart should have been racing, but something was wrong... I couldn't feel a heartbeat. Panic set in, and when I looked down at my chest, a horrifying truth began to form. I was dead, or at least, I should have been.\n\nForcing my body to move, I managed to sit up on the gurney. The room around me was dim, with flickering cold lights over rows of metal drawers that I knew contained bodies. My thoughts were foggy, but something inside me screamed that I was no longer human. An unbearable thirst, unlike anything I'd ever felt before, began to grow. It was primal, almost beastly. I needed blood.\n\nI wandered through the morgue, trying to understand what was happening to me. Every step was like learning to walk again, yet at the same time, there was a strength I never had before. My hands trembled, and when I touched my own skin, I realized it was cold, hard as marble. The panic grew when I saw my reflection in a broken piece of glass on the floor. My eyes, once brown, were now blood-red.\n\nI tried to scream, but my voice came out hoarse, almost like a growl. It was as if I was battling something inside of me, a beast that wanted to take control... the morgue, the lack of a heartbeat, the unbearable thirst burning within me. It all made sense now: I was a vampire, a creature of the night, and that realization hit me like a punch to the gut.\n\nThere was no time to think. I had to get out of there. My instincts, now heightened, led me to the exit door, but it was locked. I yanked the handle with such force that the metal bent in my hands. I felt the power surging through my veins, something I had never experienced before. It was terrifying and, at the same time, intoxicating.\n\nWhen I finally left the morgue, the darkness of the night engulfed me. The streets were deserted, and the full moon hung in the sky, casting everything in a pale light. Every sound, every movement was amplified for me, as if the entire world was screaming. The thirst for blood was growing, dominating my thoughts, and I knew I couldn't resist much longer.\n\nI remembered a small convenience store a few blocks away. People were inside their homes, living their normal lives, unaware of the monster now walking among them. As I entered the store, the jingling bell above the door sounded like a scream of alarm in my ears. The cashier looked at me with a suspicious expression, and when he opened his mouth to say something, all I could hear was the pulse of the blood in his veins.\n\nIt happened too fast. In an instant, I was on the other side of the counter, my hands around his throat. His eyes were wide with fear, but I had no control anymore. The smell of blood was unbearable, and when I bit into his flesh, the metallic taste filled my mouth. It was as if every cell in my body was starving for it.\n\nWhen I was done, I let his body drop to the floor with a dull thud. The horror of what I had done hit me, but it was too late. The beast inside me was awake, and there was no putting it back in its cage. I was a killer now, a predator, and this was my new reality.\n\nI fled the scene, leaving the lifeless body of the cashier behind. I ran through the empty streets, aimless, trying to escape the truth of what I had become. But there was nowhere to go, no place where I could hide from myself. The city felt different now, full of shadows and dangers I had never noticed before.\n\nThe following days were a blur. I hid during the day, avoiding the sun like a plague, and at night, I went out hunting, trying to quench the insatiable thirst. The guilt and horror of what I was doing never went away, but the need for blood was stronger than any human feeling. Every night was a battle against the monster inside me, a battle I knew I was losing.\n\nI was changing, slowly losing what was left of my humanity. The memories of my previous life began to fade, replaced by survival instincts. Time no longer meant anything to me. The days and nights blurred together, and I became more and more of the creature I feared.\n\nOne day, while hunting in the streets, I saw someone who recognized me. A childhood friend, someone I hadn’t seen in years. He called my name, but all I felt was hunger. There was no connection anymore, just the desire to feed. I attacked him without thinking twice, ignoring his screams of surprise and horror.\n\nWhen I finished, I felt something break inside me. The last link to my past had been destroyed, and all that remained was emptiness. I was no longer who I used to be, and any hope of redemption had vanished with my friend’s blood. I was a creature of the night, and there was no turning back.\n\nThe human world became distant, an echo of something I could no longer reach. I started avoiding people, hunting in the shadows, a specter haunting the city. My body was changing, adapting to the new reality, and with each passing day, I felt less and less human.\n\nI began to wander aimlessly through the empty streets. What was I now? A monster, a freak of nature. And worst of all, I had no choice. The hunger, the need for blood, dominated every thought, every action. I was condemned to a life of darkness and death.\n\nEventually, I found others like me. Vampires hiding in the shadows, living on the fringes of society. They took me in, taught me how to control my thirst, but the guilt never went away. I became part of a world I never wanted to know, a world where blood was the only currency.\n\nBut even among vampires, I was different. I didn’t want to be one of them, didn’t want to live this life. The memory of what I had lost haunted me, and the guilt of every life I took weighed heavily on my soul. I was a prisoner of my own existence, doomed to wander the night forever.\n\nTime passed, and I learned to survive, but never to live. With every sunset, the beast inside me awoke, and the battle began again. I was a vampire, but not by choice. And every night, I wondered how much longer I could resist before losing what was left of me.\n\nThe city changed, but my curse remained. I was a monster, doomed to walk the earth for eternity, always searching for blood, but always tormented by the guilt of what I had become. And so, the night continued, without end, without hope, without redemption.\n\nAnd in the end, all that was left was darkness.\n\nThe early morning was cold, shrouded in thick fog that covered the city streets like a ghostly blanket. I walked, aimlessly, as I did every night, looking for something to quench the unbearable thirst. The darkness was my ally, but that night, I felt something different. I was exhausted, as if eternity was slowly crushing me. When I saw the silhouette of a homeless woman curled up on the ground, my thirst came roaring back, and my instincts took over. I approached slowly, ready to attack.\n\nWhen my eyes met the woman's face, something froze my body. Her features were familiar, the lost look in her eyes... Suddenly, I saw someone from my past in her. A confused memory. My feet rooted to the ground, and the roar of thirst was silenced. My eyes locked onto hers, and my heart, which hadn't beaten in ages, almost convinced me it still existed.\n\nShe murmured something, her voice trembling, barely audible through the fog. \"Leave me...\" she begged, her voice muffled by fear. But I was lost in my own thoughts. Her face, illuminated by the dim streetlight, brought forth a memory I thought I had buried. She looked like someone... My mother... The face, the eyes... the shock made me step back.\n\nAnguish consumed me. Who had I become? What had I done to my humanity? I was about to take the life of an innocent woman, someone who, in another time, could have been the person who gave me life. The despair overwhelmed me in a way I hadn't felt since my transformation. The memories started flooding in, fragmented and painful, as if someone was tearing them from the depths of my being.\n\nI saw flashes of my life before all of this. I was just a child running through a garden in full bloom, my mother smiling in the distance. The sun bathed everything in a gentle, welcoming light. The warmth of that scene enveloped me for a moment, and I felt a pang of nostalgia, a longing for something I knew I would never have again. That day... I was happy, completely carefree. The sun was the center of everything, a life-giving force that was now denied to me.\n\nI looked at the woman again, now curled up, shivering with cold and fear on the damp ground. What was I doing?\n\nWhen my eyes met the woman’s face, something paralyzed my body. Her features were familiar, the look lost in fear... Suddenly, I saw in her someone from my past. A confusing memory. My feet froze to the ground, and the roaring thirst went silent. My eyes locked onto hers, and my heart, which hadn’t beat in so long, almost managed to fool me into thinking it still existed.\n\nShe muttered something, her trembling voice barely audible through the thick fog. \"Leave me...\" she begged, her voice muffled by fear. But I was lost in my own thoughts. Her face, illuminated by the faint light of a streetlamp, brought back a memory I thought I had buried. She resembled someone... My mother... The face, the eyes... the shock made me recoil.\n\nAnguish took hold of me. Who had I become? What had I done with my humanity? I was about to take the life of an innocent woman, someone who, at another time, could have been the person who gave me life. Despair consumed me in a way I hadn't felt since my transformation. Memories began to surface, fragmented and painful, as if someone were pulling them out of the depths of my being.\n\nI saw flashes of my life before all this. I was just a child running in a blooming garden, my mother smiling in the distance. The sun illuminated everything gently, warmly. The heat of that scene enveloped me for a moment, and I felt a pang of nostalgia, a longing for something I knew I’d never have again. That day... I was happy, completely carefree. The sun was the center of everything, a vital force that was now denied to me.\n\nI looked at the woman again, now huddled, trembling from cold and fear on the damp ground. What was I doing? I knew the answer. I couldn't keep living like this. It was a miserable existence, full of pain, guilt, and darkness. I needed to see the sun again, to feel its warmth on my face, even if only for a brief moment. I knew what that meant. I knew the sun would be my end.\n\nBut it didn’t matter anymore. I no longer wanted this life of shadows. I didn’t want to be a creature of the night, a bloodthirsty beast that hunted the living. I slowly backed away, leaving the woman behind as the chaos in my mind began to calm down.\n\nI walked up to a hill where I knew I’d have a clear view of the sunrise. The sky was starting to brighten, with faint traces of pink and orange, signaling that the sun would soon rise on the horizon. I sat down on the grass, waiting for the inevitable. The memories kept flowing, clearer each time, but at the same time distant, like a life that belonged to someone else.\n\nThe first ray of sunlight broke through the horizon, and I felt the warmth touch my skin. I closed my eyes, letting the light envelop me, slowly burning my flesh, but bringing a peace I hadn't felt in a long time.\n\nAnd, for the first time since becoming a vampire, I smiled."},"890":{"title":"Phantom Waves of Myrtle Beach","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewx7fj\/phantom_waves_of_myrtle_beach\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the chilling legends of Myrtle Beach, where ghostly encounters and eerie tales linger on the shore.

Like most people, I was entranced by the idea of these fantastic creatures living in harmony with humans, battling by our side, and forming unbreakable bonds. The excitement of catching a new Pokémon, the thrill of a gym battle, and the camaraderie between trainers were what made life feel so magical. But as I grew older, the innocent charm of Pokémon began to fade. The more I learned, the more I realized that the world of Pokémon wasn’t as idyllic as it seemed. There was a darker side, a hidden world where the creatures we adored weren’t friends but something far more sinister.\n\n\n\nIt all started when my friend Dan invited me to dinner. Dan was a chef who worked in one of the most exclusive restaurants in Saffron City. He’d always been a bit mysterious about his job, but when he said he had something special to show me, I couldn’t resist. “You won’t believe what you’re about to experience,” he promised with a grin.\n\n\n\nThe restaurant was hidden away, far from the bustling streets, nestled in the shadow of the towering Silph Co. building. We navigated through a series of narrow alleys until we reached a heavy, unmarked door. Dan knocked three times, and a small hatch slid open. After a brief exchange, we were let inside.\n\n\n\nThe interior was luxurious, almost decadently so. Red velvet lined the walls, and chandeliers cast a warm, golden glow over everything. The air was thick with the scent of rich, savory aromas that made my mouth water despite a growing sense of unease.\n\n\n\nWe were seated at a private table in the back, away from the other diners. The menu was handed to us, but it was unlike any menu I’d ever seen. There were no descriptions, just a list of names: Charizard, Blastoise, Miltank, Snorlax… The prices were astronomical.\n\n\n\nI looked at Dan, confused, but he just smirked and told me to trust him. He ordered for both of us, selecting a dish labeled simply as “*Rare.*”\n\n\n\nWhen the food arrived, I could barely contain my shock. Before me was a beautifully plated dish, a perfectly cooked steak that looked like it had been seared to perfection. It can make any Italian say \"Mama Mia!\" Or whatever they say over there. \n\n\n\nBut there was something off about it, that feeling of not immediately identifying which cut of beef it is. It definitely looked superb, marbled. It looked rich in fat and muscle, a perfect juicy steak. Dan had no plans on telling what cut it is, after asking for the 4th time in a span of 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n“Go on,” Dan urged, “*take a bite*.”\n\n\n\nI hesitated but eventually gave in, cutting off a small piece and placing it in my mouth. The flavor was indescribable, a perfect blend of tenderness and rich, *slight smokiness*, savory goodness. I must admit, it tasted more chicken that beef, with the exact texture of filet mignon. Flavor profile and texture was all over the place. Every chew was enjoyable, worth the bank-breaking price it was set to. \"What kind of meat is this?\" I asked Dan. \"**This is truly divine!**\" I exclaimed. Dan responding with an expression that says \"I told you so.\" \n\n\n\nBut as I chewed and chewed, a horrifying realization began to dawn on me.\n\n\n\nThe texture was all too familiar, reminiscent of the specialty Pokemon food I had fed my Arcanine and Machamp (Evolved him from Machop myself) when I was younger. It wasn’t the standard stuff you’d find at a Poké Mart. No, this was high-end, designed for powerful and competitive Pokémon, filled with rich proteins and rare ingredients to enhance their strength and endurance. \n\n\n\nI adored my Pokémon like my own flesh and blood, you see. Though not particularly rich, my family supported my trainer career with passion. In addition, I found side hustles to do so I can afford to give them the good stuff. I remembered the way they’d chew on it, savoring every bite, their eyes lighting up with satisfaction. That same texture, the same density, almost fibrous consistency, *was now in my mouth.*\n\n\n\n“You know what it is, don’t you?” he asked, leaning in closer. “*That’s Charizard meat. Flame Tail Filet, to answer your question earlier.*\" He smiled menacingly, eyes cold as ice. \"*One of the rarest delicacies in the world.*”\n\n\n\nI dropped my fork, bile rising in my throat. “**What the hell are you talking about?**” I stammered.\n\n\n\nHe laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. “You didn’t think they were just battling and living in the wild, did you? No no no, my friend. Some Pokémon…*they’re bred for more than just companionship or battle*. They’re bred for their meat, their hides, their bones. Speaking of the bones, oh how lovely *Squirtle Shell Bisque* is!\" He paused reminiscing that sick memory I don't want to know more details of. \"The elite, they pay top dollar for the chance to eat something that no one else can. That’s the true dark side of Pokémon.”\n\n\n\nI was frozen, my mind racing to comprehend what he was saying. “**But that’s fucking illegal, Dan!**” I protested.\n\n\n\n“Illegal?” he scoffed. “Sure, on the surface. But money talks, my friend. The black market for Pokemon is massive. You think Team Rocket was just about stealing them for power? Nope, they supply for restaurants like this. They’d capture rare Pokémon, slaughter them, and sell the meat to the highest bidder. And this isn’t just happening here. It’s global. Kanto, Johto, Sinnoh… every region has its own trade.”\n\n\n\nI felt sick, my heart pounding in my chest. “How… how could people do this?”\n\n\n\nHe shrugged. “*It’s business*. People will pay for what they want, and as long as there’s demand, there’ll be supply. It’s the way the world works.”\n\n\n\nI couldn’t listen anymore. I pushed away from the table and ran to the bathroom, barely making it in time before vomiting into the toilet. The taste of the Charizard meat still lingered in my mouth, a cruel reminder of what I had just ingested.\n\n\n\nWhen I finally composed myself enough to leave, Dan was waiting outside the bathroom door, a look of mild concern on his face.\n\n\n\n“Don’t take it too hard,” he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “*This is just how the world really works*. Not everyone gets to see it, but now you know. And believe me, once you’ve tasted it, *you’ll never want to go back.*”\n\n\n\nI shoved him away and stormed out of the restaurant, my mind reeling. How could something so beloved, so cherished by millions, be twisted into something so horrific? How many innocent Pokémon had been slaughtered for the sake of someone’s perverse enjoyment?\n\n\n\nThat night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the faces of the Pokémon I had caught and trained over the years, their trusting eyes looking up at me. My prized Arcanine turned into Flame-Roasted Steak and my trusty Machamp into Muscle Ribs? I wondered how many of them had met the same fate as that Charizard.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I threw out everything I had related to Pokémon. My games, my cards, my memorabilia… I couldn’t bear to look at them anymore. The world of Pokémon had been tainted for me, its innocence forever shattered.\n\n\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I tried to forget, but the memory of that night refused to fade. I avoided Dan, stopped visiting Saffron City, and cut ties with anyone who might remind me of what I had seen.\n\n\n\n*But the taste lingered.*\n\n\n\nEvery meal seemed to echo that same flavor, a faint whisper of the Charizard steak that haunted my nightmares. I tried everything to cleanse my palate, but nothing worked. The taste followed me, a shadow I couldn’t escape.\n\n\n\nOne night, I found myself in front of a jar of old Pokémon food, something I had kept out of nostalgia. Driven by a compulsion I couldn’t ignore, I tasted a pellet. The flavor was identical to the steak.\n\n\n\nThe horrifying realization hit me: the Pokémon food I had fed my team was made from the same meat served in that restaurant.

The hunger I felt was more than physical—it was a primal, insatiable craving.\n\n\n\nDesperately, I threw out the Pokémon food and locked myself away. But the hunger gnawed at me relentlessly. I knew it was only a matter of time before I gave in.\n\n\n\nOne night, the hunger became unbearable. I found myself standing outside that unmarked door, my body trembling with anticipation.

It’s been a strange day. I left work later than usual and decided to take a walk through the park to unwind. Normally, the park is a soothing escape from the stress of the office. But tonight, it felt different. The moon was full, and its light made the shadows stretch unnaturally long. The trees cast ominous silhouettes, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands.\n\nAs I walked, I saw a figure in the distance, standing near a park bench beneath a large oak tree. At first, I thought it was just someone sitting quietly, but when I blinked, the figure was gone. I stopped and looked around, but there was no one. I tried to convince myself it was a trick of the light or maybe just my imagination. But even after I left the park and reached home, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I checked the locks on my door twice before going to bed, and still, I lay there with my heart racing, convinced that someone—or something—was out there.\n\n-END OF ENTRY-\n\n**Police Report: Case #5847-2024**\n\n**Date of Report:** August 16, 2024  \n**Time of Report:** 11:15 AM  \n**Reporting Officer:** Detective Laura Reynolds  \n**Badge Number:** 4527  \n**Incident Address:** 214 Maple Street, Apartment 5B, Springfield  \n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Analysis of Diary Entry - Michael Donovan\n\n**Summary of Entry:**\n\nThe following is a detailed analysis of Entry 1 from Michael Donovan’s diary, dated May 10, 2024. This entry has been highlighted due to its potential relevance in understanding the initial stages of the victim’s escalating fear and subsequent events leading to his death.\n\n**Diary Entry Analysis:**\n\n**Entry Content:**\n\nMichael Donovan’s entry for May 10, 2024, documents his unsettling experience during an evening walk through a local park. Key observations from the entry include:\n\n1. **Environmental Description:**\n   - Donovan describes the park as having an unusual atmosphere due to the full moon casting long, eerie shadows. The trees are personified as having \"skeletal hands,\" indicating a heightened sense of foreboding.\n\n2. **Sightings and Perceptions:**\n   - The entry details an encounter with a figure at a distance, which Donovan initially perceived as a person sitting on a park bench. The figure's sudden disappearance upon blinking suggests a moment of disorientation or possibly a misinterpretation of visual stimuli. This experience appears to have caused significant anxiety, as Donovan states he felt he was being watched even after leaving the park.\n\n3. **Psychological Impact:**\n   - Donovan’s reaction to the incident—checking the locks on his door multiple times and experiencing a racing heart—demonstrates a high level of distress and paranoia. His description of feeling that \"someone—or something—was out there\" indicates the beginning of a deep-seated fear, which seems to have persisted beyond this initial encounter.\n\n**Investigative Relevance:**\n\n1. **Initial Indications:**\n   - This entry provides early evidence of the victim’s growing paranoia and fear. It sets a precedent for the victim's increasing sense of being stalked, which is consistent with the diary entries found at the crime scene.\n\n2. **Contextualization:**\n   - The environment described—an unnervingly quiet park under a full moon—may contribute to understanding the psychological state of the victim at this time. The description of shadows and the figure might suggest a heightened sensitivity to seemingly innocuous events, further exacerbated by the victim’s psychological state.\n\n3. **Correlation with Later Events:**\n   - The entry’s mention of a feeling of being watched aligns with the victim’s later diary entries, which describe more intense and persistent fears of a shadowy figure or entity. This provides a timeline for the escalation of the victim’s paranoia and fear.\n\n**Action Taken:**\n\n1. **Scene and Environmental Review:**\n   - Officers have revisited the park described in the diary entry to assess the validity of the victim’s experiences and to look for any environmental factors that could have contributed to his perception. No significant findings have been reported from the park environment as of this report.\n\n2. **Witness Interviews:**\n   - Neighbors and individuals frequenting the park have been interviewed to determine if anyone noticed unusual behavior or sightings that could corroborate Donovan’s experience.\n\n3. **Forensic Analysis:**\n   - Forensic experts are analyzing the victim’s psychological state based on diary entries to understand the potential influence on his behavior leading up to his death.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe entry from May 10, 2024, marks the beginning of Michael Donovan’s documented fear and paranoia. It provides a crucial insight into the early stages of his distress and the psychological impact of his experiences. Further investigation is ongoing to connect this entry with the broader pattern of threats and the ultimate circumstances of his death.\n\n**Case Status:** Ongoing Investigation\n\n**Detective Laura Reynolds**  \n**Badge Number:** 4527  \n**Springfield Police Department**\n\n### **Detective’s Personal Log: Case #5847-2024**\n\n**Date:** August 16, 2024  \n**Detective:** Laura Reynolds\n\nIt’s been one of those days where the weight of a case feels heavier with every hour that passes. I’ve been pouring over Michael Donovan’s file, trying to piece together the fragments of his life leading up to his death. Today, I focused on his first diary entry from May 10, 2024, and the eerie shift it represents.\n\nThe entry is unsettling, detailing a seemingly ordinary walk through the park that devolved into something much darker. Donovan describes how the park, usually a place of peace, transformed into a landscape of dread under the full moon. He saw a figure by the bench, and it disappeared when he blinked. This isn’t just a strange sighting; it’s a marker of something deeply troubling in his state of mind.\n\nI spent the morning revisiting the park where Donovan had his encounter. It was a quiet, serene place, far removed from the horror he described. I walked the same path he did, stopping at the bench beneath the oak tree. The park was bathed in sunlight, nothing like the shadow-filled nightmare Donovan must have experienced. I tried to imagine what it must have been like for him that night, but all I saw was an ordinary park. It’s haunting how something so ordinary could be perceived as so menacing.\n\nI also went back to Donovan’s apartment to review the scene and see if anything from that night might have contributed to his paranoia. The apartment was untouched, almost eerily so. Everything was in its place, but there was a strange stillness to the environment. It’s as if Donovan was trying to maintain control over his surroundings even as his mind was unraveling. I took another look at the locks and the windows, but there were no signs of tampering or intrusion. It’s unsettling to think that despite everything seeming normal, something so profound could have happened.\n\nI spoke with Donovan’s neighbors to get a sense of his behavior leading up to his death. Mrs. Tanner, an elderly woman from his floor, was particularly insightful. She mentioned hearing footsteps in the hallway at odd hours, but when she checked, no one was there. More intriguingly, she spoke about seeing shadows moving under Donovan’s door even when his apartment was dark. She described them as “alive,” which only adds to the growing sense of dread in this case. I made sure to jot down her observations. You never know what might become significant.\n\nLater, I met with Donovan’s coworkers. They described him as increasingly withdrawn in the weeks leading up to his death. One of them, a woman named Sarah, noted that Donovan would sometimes stop mid-sentence and stare off into space, as if distracted by something invisible. She recalled one instance where Donovan had been staring out the window for almost an hour. When asked what he was looking at, he simply said, “Nothing. It’s gone now.” Sarah’s description of his behavior adds another layer to the timeline of his growing paranoia.\n\nI also had IT try to trace the number from the threatening message Donovan received. Unsurprisingly, there was no trace of it. It’s frustrating, but not unexpected. Each lead that slips away feels like another piece of the puzzle falling through my fingers.\n\nTonight, I’ll be revisiting Donovan’s personal effects. There’s a nagging feeling that there’s something I missed the first time. It’s a feeling that something about this case is just beyond my reach, slipping through like sand. I need to find out what drove Donovan to such a state of fear and how it all ties into his death. If I don’t, I worry that whatever haunted him might move on to someone else—or that it’s already too late.\n\n**End of Log**"},"895":{"title":"Episode 1: Eidolon ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewntx6\/episode_1_eidolon\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dudepersin","selftext":"Somewhere on this plane of existence at a desolate car storage and salvage yard, the fate of thousands of lives are on the crux of finding their place in the eternal grand design.\n \n\" Ok, Mr. Clancy after a bit of digging through our paper archives we've found the proper information that will allow us to release your fathers car to you. Once again sorry for the wait,\n\n\"I've got all the time in the world\" clancy said, \"ahh the retired life must be one amazing maze of doing whatever you feel passionate about for the rest of your days.

Clancy told them to drop it as the clerk signaled the crane operator to disengage, the container smashed into the ground dispersing a dense cloud of dust, \n\nSinclair walked into the container and threw out the passenger door then an oversized duffel bag that hit the ground and almost put a dent in the dirt he hopped out and grabbed the bag walked to the clerk \"there's another bag in the driver's seat &amp; you look like a fair and reasonable man that's tired of working for a living do whatever you want with it as clancy looked to the Sun and began to walk. \"He's not coming back for it is he?\" The crane operator yelled down as clancy departed into The horizon as the slim black figure began to blend into the heat mirage until he became an indistinguishable elusive Phantasm waltzing in the daylight. \n\n\"What the hell was in that bag\" the clerk whispered to himself. \"Hey Jim what the hell was that about?\" \"Dear Horatio there are things in heaven and Earth not meant to be understood by the minds of mortal men\" \"who the hell is Horatio and what are we going to do with this pile of scrap\" \"move it to the heap and tag it that'll give Marcus something to do tomorrow instead of annoying the hell out of me. \n\n\"Got a few more hours until we can get out of here\" the crane operator yelled out \"for you maybe but I've still got some paperwork to mock up\" \"cameras were rolling today right boss? Something about that stranger don't sit right with me. \"Forget about it Fred I'm pretty sure he'd say the same about you if y'all had a conversation\". \n\nAs night fell Jim was enamored by his thoughts and schemes contemplating what kind of wealth was to be amassed with an ominous fortune to be seized. Jim waited outside the cameras view ready to strike like a ghost in the night \"2 minutes until they reset ha I used to complain to the old man and the new cronies that it's time to upgrade and stop wiping the tapes, hmph maybe they had some skeletons in the closet\". With a flashlight in hand, he made his way to the wreckage.\n\n \"Lot 9 section 2\" he repeated as the unusual stacks of rubbish bent and creaked under pressure and the pressure was definitely on. \"Finally here\"  sweat had began to saturate his shirt and bead down his face, he kicked the container to rattle any rodents that may have found their way in there at that instance he began to rummage inside the wreckage, he noticed something glowing in the car it was faint and alluring, which should have been an auspicious warning to beware be wary and be aware. The light faded as he was temporarily distracted by a noise and was replaced by a pulsating vibration that had gone unnoticed due to Jim's heart beating 5 miles a minute.\n\n He took his knife and started cutting into the seat to reveal a blue duffel bag that felt like it weighed 100 pounds, believing in the addage of working smarter not harder jim went to the supply hut to get a dolly after he had lugged the bag out of the container. Upon opening the hut door he almost shit his pants in the dark store room there was a human shaped silhouette, as he yelled and kicked at the shadows then aimed his flashlight into the darkness to have his fear alleviated for the moment \"I'm losing it, I that thought it was that guy from earlier\" \n\n(ignoring the unimportant transit) Jim had arrived at his apartment and double locked his doors and windows. His eyes were to be the only ones to witness the splendor of his bounty. As he threw the bag on his coffee table it was pulverized and splintered under the weight of the bag, which should have been expected from a rational mind but greed had taken hold of him as he ripped the bag open to have his fantasies fulfilled. \n\nHis eyes were affixed to the largest amount of money he had ever seen, yet the crown jewel would have been a small blood red gem that was oddly wet and unrealistically heavy. His face almost ripped by how hard he was smiling due to the prosperity at hand. As jim planned out the rest of his life of luxury an odd rapping at the door occurred, which subsequently made him hurl the pile of money he had in his hands into the ceiling fan. \n\nBeing an anti-social person compounded by the paranoia of a duffle bag bursting with money made him overly cautious, as he crept to his room to retrieve his shotgun the knocking turned into pounding &amp; door knob rattling. Jim silently and cautiously went to the peephole to see who was causing calamity outside, all to have goosebumps replace his epidermis.\n\n\"Tha... That's that strange fellows hat\" believing that coincidences are just meticulously laid plans, laden with deception and misdirection. It was lazily placed directly in the middle of the hallway.That more than enough to propel Jim's adrenaline and fear into overdrive as terror took hold of his nervous system, solely focused on surviving another second his more keen primal senses had betrayed Jim.\n\n Making him deaf to the sounds of every window and door in his apartment unlocking he was still affixed on the hat, utterly frozen in fear the lights in the hallway started to flicker, followed by a door in the hallway being blown off it's hinges, then another followed it up as it continued up the hallway leading to Jim's room. Adding to the pure blood chilling pandemonium that he had recently been subject to, the sight of hands riddled with maggots and decayed flesh began clawing their way out of the dark rooms the undead have escaped from hell as revenants they began making their way towards him. Even with their hollow eye sockets he could feel their cold stares tear his soul asunder.\n\nAs Jim backed up slowly, to distance himself from the skeletal denizens, he was halted by something that should not have been there, Jim had almost broken the wooden butt of his shotgun by clenching it so hard. He jerked around and shot blindly as he missed the target and reduced the pile cash into a green mist all to be met by the visage of an uncloaked reaper with one blood red gem in its eye socket. As it's unnatural maw began to open the pungent oder of decay and sulfur made Jim's innards erupt. The skeletal figure screeched and the sight of shredded vocal cords reverberated violently and shook the room. was more than noticeable.\n\nAs Jim stood paralyzed utterly oblivious to the fact that he had been hoisted up by the entity as it's mouth opened instead of seeing through it, he saw visions, the old town hotel, legions of foul demonic creatures in an arena, and his own body being hoisted by death itself, his body had gone cold the extreme heat of the entity began to scorch the area, a scaley claw came from it's mouth and gripped Jim's face and as his his skull began to creak and crack Jim spat at the beast \"there's one shot left you ugly fucking beast.\" Boom!"},"896":{"title":"Moon Mad: Part 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewnc9p\/moon_mad_part_2\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Mysterious-Ad-4795","selftext":"Jamie attended Suzy’s funeral on a windy and rainy Saturday two weeks after she was found murdered. Jamie was asked by Suzy’s mother to say a few words about her best friend at the service, and Jamie agreed she would. But when she sat down to type the eulogy of Suzy Fallon, all that came were tears, bathtubs of them. Jamie was in the perpetual storm of grief, and constructing a coherent sentence felt like being tasked with climbing Mount Everest. She had heard about loss leaving a hole in a person but considered it an idiom folks say so they can hide their emotional scars and move forward with their day. \nBut Jamie was wrong. The hole was real. And the pain announced itself in the center of her abdomen the moment she got the news about Suzy and Kirk. It was an outwardly combustible pain, and it wasn’t heartburn. It resided in a part of the body that didn't have a physical label. The cloying, althorn pang was Jamie’s soul lamenting the loss of the person she had her first sleepover and selfie-taking extravaganza with. The only person tagged in her phone as BFF.\nHarveston High held a candlelight vigil on the varsity baseball field for the slain sweethearts. Jamie closed her eyes and listened to Kirk’s teammates gush praise upon him. You would've thought Kirk Wendle cured cancer, but it was illogical bro-code, the boys doubling down on their sorrow by upping the testosterone in their word vomit. \nJamie opened her eyes and surveyed the crowd: every senior was there, any faculty who had Suzy or Kirk as a student, and of course, Harveston High’s principal and vice-principal. Then it hit Jamie like a bolt of violet-hot lightning. Mr. Caninus was not present at the ceremony. \nAfter the flames on the candles were extinguished and hugs were exchanged, Jamie got in her car and sat. She thought about what was missing from the vigil and caressed her midsection when grief’s hole boomed inside her. There were no conversations about the FM Killer being involved in the triple slayings, despite amateur Sherlocks on social media corroborating evidence found in Suzy and Kirk’s motel room with the crime scenes in Whitman’s Mill. \nJamie understood that Harveston P.D. didn’t want to throw gasoline onto the fire. If people were aficionados at anything these days, it was going into panic mode. But a nugget of doubt took her back to Mr. Caninus.\n\nA year ago, Suzy, Kirk, and Jamie were in his Biology class. He was a soft-spoken man with a handsome face. Some students even thought he was a DILF. Jamie’s review of Mr. Caninus wasn’t nearly as glowing. When lecturing to the class, Mr. Caninus struggled to make eye contact. He was also ungodly pale and wore pants that were three sizes too big.\nWhen Jamie approached to ask him a question, the world felt upside down, out of sync. Mr. Caninus had his head down, and Jamie caught him scrambling for a pen and piece of paper to make himself look busy as she walked toward his desk. She was given an incomplete on an assignment, the letter I circled in red pen at the top of the page. But Jamie had answered all the prompts, cited her work, and didn’t use any Wikipedia links because Mr. Caninus deemed them inadequate sources in the prestigious arena of academia. \n“Why did I get an incomplete?” Jamie asked. \nMr. Caninus crossed out some words on someone’s homework with his red pen. Jamie cleared her throat. Mr. Caninus glanced up, his gaze not matching hers, and held out his hand. Jamie proffered him the paper. Mr. Caninus snatched it and looked at it with narrowed eyes.  \n“The date,” Mr. Caninus said in a robotic and customer service-like voice.  \nJamie pulled out her iPhone and read the date from the home screen.\n “It’s the 13th,” she said. Mr. Caninus nodded and waited for Jamie to solve the matter herself, but she was too angry. \n“No,” he said. “The date on your paper… where is it?” \nMr. Caninus handed the paper back to Jamie. She took it from him and skimmed the paper’s header. Jamie had failed to put a date on it. More depressing, she couldn’t remember why. Maybe her mother and Chad had been having loud and distracting sex the night she typed it. That repugnant scenario seemed probable. But when Jamie processed what Mr. Canisus told her, she curled her toes inside her black Chuck Taylor’s. \n“Wait, Mr. Caninus,” Jamie said. “Are you failing me because I forgot to put the correct date on my paper?”\n“No,” he said. “You’re failing because you didn’t put any date on it.” \nJamie shuttered her eyes and tried to imagine something calm, like the beach at the Jersey Shore her father took her to when she was a tot. The two would hike the boardwalk, and Jamie’s father would insert ten dollars into the change machine. She loved the sound of the quarters jingling as the machine fed them into the tray, the coins waiting to be looted by her petite hands. It was a cherished memory. Too bad it didn’t work. \n“Fuck you!” Jamie yelled with a tomato-red face, her hands quivering at her sides. She added, “Suzy uses Wikipedia! And Kirk doesn’t even know what MLA format means! When have you ever failed them?! Never! Freaking, dickless!”  \nThe classroom was graveyard silent. Kirk went to speak, wanting to defend himself against Jamie’s allegation, but Suzy promptly squeezed his forearm. \nShivering with anger, Jamie waited for Mr. Caninus's retort. He decided to suck on the butt of his red pen instead. Jamie knew she had crossed an unforgivable line. \nMr. Caninus discharged a brisk grunt, but that was it. He plucked a fresh pen out of his pen holder—a coffee mug shaped like a Siberian Husky—tore a sheet of paper from his legal pad and wrote. \nJamie glanced back at Suzy and Kirk. Kirk gave her a cartoonish thumbs-up. Suzy swatted him over the head. Some students had their phones out, recording. Jamie feebly waved at them. \nWhen she turned around, Mr. Caninus stood, looking down at her with that inexorable blankness in his eyes. He held out a folded piece of yellow paper for Jamie. She took it, unfolded it, and read it. Jamie found it tricky to swallow when she saw the letter was addressed to the principal. But the prose was a play-by-play of what had transpired, and there was no spin in it to make Mr. Caninus the more sympathetic party.\n\nJamie turned the key in the ignition. She went to turn on the radio but stopped herself. She recalled a song she listened to the night Suzy and Kirk went to the cornfield. The song talked about paintings being counterfeits, bleeding ink, and a man who leaves the girl with a hole inside her that she’ll never be able to mend. Jamie popped the car into drive, pressed the gas to the floor, and drove to her house on Cabin Creek Lane. \nWhen she got home, she ran up the stairs and into her room but slammed the door behind her a little too loud for Chad’s liking. “Jesus Christ, people are trying to sleep!” he yelled from downstairs. “Have you lost your fucking mind?!” \nJamie didn't answer him, and a morbid thought about Chad shoved its way into her brain. It should have been you that got their face scraped off and stuffed up their asshole. She sat down at her desk and booted up her laptop. The time had come to summon an active role in Suzy and Kirk’s killings. Jamie, intrepid and resourceful, believed she could do it with the click of some keys and a wireless mouse. \nFor two weeks, Jamie dedicated herself to amassing as much data on Mr. Caninus as possible. The fourteen days were like a montage in an action movie; Jamie speed-reading hundreds of articles on the FM Killer, throwing down energy drinks and protein bars, and churning social media apps for posts with Mr. Caninus in them. \nJamie yearned to see the essential information behind the Internet’s many paywalls. She regretted not applying for a credit card when she turned eighteen in July. She had heard countless tales from her peers that the cards were a bigger scam than student loans. Jamie kept the Visas and Mastercards of the universe at bay, but now she was stuck between an economic rock and a hard place. \nAround two in the morning in the first week of December, Jamie wiped the fatigue from her eyes and gazed out the window; it was snowing. She watched the flurries descend as the moon in the background smoothed the gossamer flakes with its flaxen light. \nInvigorated by the virgin snow—something Jamie regarded as a sign of hope—she stealthily left her room and tiptoed down the hallway, ensuring the floorboards didn’t croak underfoot. Across the hall, Chad and her mother slept, and Jamie prayed they were miles into a drunken slumber. \nShe knew her mother hung her purse on the kitchen table the nights she and Chad went to THE TIPSY TURTLE PUB (which was every night). They were addicts, and both had delivered paper-thin support to Suzy's parents and Jamie. But it wasn’t all bleak because addicts don’t know the meaning of personal responsibility. And this gave Jamie the all-clear to pocket her mother’s easy-to-swipe Discover card from the Temu-Chanel handbag dangling from the kitchen chair. \nOn her way back to her room, armed with her mother’s credit card, Jamie stopped at the sight of Willy Wonka sitting at the front door. He was growling, and ropes of drool dripped from his jowls. Jamie walked over to Willy Wonka and patted him on the crown of his head.  \n“Hey, Mr. Wonka, whatcha ya looking at?” Jamie whispered. \nShe bluntly realized how tired she was because Willy Wonka hadn’t seen anything since 2022. She was sleep-deprived. Heck, if Jamie’s doctor told her she no longer secreted melatonin, the diagnosis would be as predictable as another Hollywood reboot. The big brown lab ceased to sound like a bullhorn, settled by Jamie’s consoling touch, but his bristling hackles put a kink in Jamie’s throat. \nBiting her lower lip, Jamie looked out the window next to the door. Her eyes pivoted like a seismometer pendulum, ready to record an earthquake shaped like a knife-wielding boogeyman. But Cabin Creek Lane was fantastically brushed with snow, and the winter-glazed Cape Cods were a vista Norman Rockwell would be proud to paint. \nJamie felt Willy Wonka nudge up to her thigh. She glanced down at him, the hackles still on end. WHAM! Jamie bounced away from the window while Willy Wonka barked. With a hand clutched over her mouth, Jamie’s heart throbbed. \nShe collected herself and slowly pushed her face back to the window. A blackbird, likely confused by winter’s headlong arrival, had flown into the window. Jamie took her hand away from her mouth and told Willy Wonka everything was fine in a subdued voice. \nShe watched the bird expire. There were the spastic flaps of its broken wings, and the snow gathered on its feathers like ants to a spilled milkshake. Jamie inched back from the window and thought of the stories she read as a child. The fairy tales about hidden dangers and portents. \nHer mind was tormented by a singular anxiety-stirring question. What if the FM Killer is a supernatural force whose sweet spot is the realm between the living and the dead? Jamie wished upon the lifeless blackbird that her mother’s Discover card had credit to burn. \n\nOn December 19th, National Hard Candy Day, Jamie turned onto the street Mr. Caninus lived on with an assist from FindersFee.com. For the modest price of $69.99, the website's report put Jamie on the fast track to an idyllic suburban street inside one of those subdivisions where any lawn ornament requires HOA approval. \nThe afternoon sun blazed into Jamie’s car, making it feel like an oven was set to four hundred degrees inside the cockpit. It was summer in December. Fuck you very much, Global Warming. Steeped in sweat, Jamie cranked up the A\/C, the cool air hissing from the vents. With a light foot on the gas, Jamie’s Toyota Corolla crawled down the street. She fretted that the torpid speed of the car would attract unwanted eyeballs. \nAfter Jamie printed out Mr. Caninus’s “life report” and read page 1 of 25, an eyebrow gabled. Mr. Caninus's home address wasn’t in Harveston. It was in Whitman’s Mill. The same town where the FM Killer’s reign of full-moon carnage kicked off. The first pawn on the chessboard had moved up two squares because in Jamie’s fingers was evidence. Evidence that placed Mr. Caninus in the orbit of the two towns where life had needlessly been taken. \nJamie’s disdain for the psychopath knew no bounds, but her contempt for the lack of reporting on the murders in Harveston was leveling up. It was egregious that the police hadn’t named a suspect, and the cause of death and the identity of the body found behind Saint Benedict’s were being sealed by some judge. No revelations were coming out of Whitman’s Mill either. \nConspiracy hit Jamie like a sledgehammer to the knee, but maybe it was a symptom of being in a community that lived in three-story isolation. Jamie’s lip twisted under the nibble of her teeth. Was the toff status quo of Whitman’s Mill slithering its way into Harveston? Jamie was forced to cancel the question because her GPS declared she had arrived at her destination. 3178 Bates Street.   \nJamie rang the doorbell and waited, her heart driving laps in her chest. She took a palliative breath and glanced to her right. No cars were in the driveway (Mr. Caninus was at school teaching), but a vehicle could be in the garage. The only name listed on the FindersFee report as having a “connection” to Mr. Caninus and the home on 3178 Bates Street was Vivian Caninus, his mother. Jamie heard some rattling behind the door, the repercussions of locks coming unhinged. The door whined open, and a little old lady with hair as white as rice, crystal blue eyes, and a liver-spotted face stood before Jamie. \nThe old lady smiled and said, “Are you lost, dear?” \nJamie wiped the sweat from her neck. She had outlined a script to recite if this very moment came, but Jamie drew a blank the size of Russia. \n“No… well,” she said. “I’m Jamie McCauley.” \nThe old lady gave her a look of bemusement. Jamie knew she had to rally her thoughts, go ad-hoc, and deliver a knockout. \n“I was a student of your son,” Jamie said. “He was the best science teacher I had. I was hoping he would write a letter of recommendation for me. I’m trying to get into MIT, but it’s a really tight-knit boys club up there.” \nThe old lady nodded and relaxed her posture. Jamie displayed her school ID. She was iffy on playing the sisterhood card, older generations weren’t as receptive to that narrative as Jamie’s generation was.  \n“He’ll be home in an hour,” the old lady said. “I just made some iced tea because of this fickle weather. One day, it’s hot cocoa; the next, it’s iced tea. What’s this world coming to?”  \n“Yeah, I know,” Jamie said. “Climate change, what a conspiracy, right?” \nThe old lady chuckled at the snarky quip. \n“But I’d love some iced tea!” Jamie exclaimed with the giddiness of a bubblegum pop song. \n“My name’s Vivian,” the old lady said, giving Jamie a path to enter the house. \nJamie forged a smile as she crossed the threshold and stepped into 3178’s foyer. Vivian shut the door behind them with a spine-tingling thud. \nSitting at the kitchen table, Jamie glanced around the room. The walls were adorned with oil paintings of Vivian through the years, from an adolescent to a golden-aged Vivian. In each painting, there was a dog with her. \nVivian carried a tray of iced tea and glasses over. She gently placed it on the table, and the ice cubes in the pitcher clinked about. \n“You're a dog lover?” Jamie asked. \nVivian sat down and observed the portraits with a wistful grin.\n“What gave it away?” \nJamie laughed, but her eyes clung to Vivian’s fingers as she poured the tea. Every tendon in Jamie’s body went piano-wire-tight. Kirk and Suzy’s promise rings were on Vivian’s left and right hands. Kirk’s promise ring was on Vivian’s thumb, and Suzy’s was on her middle finger. Vivian slid a glass of tea over to Jamie with a polite smile.  \n“Thank you,” Jamie said. “Those rings… they’re beautiful.” \n“Thanks. I thought so, too.”\n“Were they a gift?” Jamie asked, raising the glass of tea to her lips and taking a punkish slurp. \nThe noisy sip caused Vivian to suspend her pouring. She gave Jamie a look of repulsion. Jamie saw it and memory-banked it; Vivian had a weakness—poor decorum. \n“They were a gift,” Vivian said, filling her glass. \n“From whom?” Jamie asked, taking another obnoxious sip. “Delicious tea, by the way. Do you have any lemon?” \n“I don’t, sorry,” Vivian said.\nTension floated in the air between the two women. Jamie pointed at Suzy’s promise ring, “So… they were a gift?”  \n“I thought you were here for a letter of recommendation?” \n“I am, but you should never answer a question with a question,” Jamie said. “It’s passive-aggressive. A crappy defense mechanism.”  \nVivian squeezed the thumb ring with her other hand, angling it toward Jamie, “Darcy gave it to me for my 70th birthday.”\n“Who’s Darcy?” Jamie asked. \n“My son. Your teacher. You don’t know the name of your favorite teacher?”\nJamie’s thoughts were a torture chamber with medieval devices everywhere. The report listed Mr. Caninus as D. Caninus, and Jamie reasoned his name was Dick or Dan… but… Darcy?! \nNo wonder he carried himself with such insecurity. Jamie extrapolated that he was likely bullied as a kid and called every name in the book. And his mother, Old Mrs. V., was wearing the proof of the monster it created. \n“Your son didn’t get those rings from a store, Mrs.—”\n“Miss. My husband died when Darcy was just a little boy.”\nA lot of pieces were dancing around the chessboard, and Jamie took a moment to stare at an oil painting. Vivian Caninus posed regally with a Pomeranian in her lap, both with leaden eyes, doll's eyes. Jamie’s brain spotlighted another word in all caps: SOULLESS. Her focus returned to Vivian, who circled the promise ring on her middle finger like a rusty carousel. \n “I’m sorry for your loss, Ms. Caninus,” Jamie said. \nVivian replied in a bland tone, “I’m sorry for your casualties as well.” \nVivian coolly gulped down her drink, stood up, pushed her chair in, and walked over to the sink. Jamie’s sanity felt like oatmeal. The old crazy bitch knew damn well who those rings belonged to. \nJamie pinched the back of her hand, jerking her out of her funk. She pulled out her iPhone. Vivian’s back was to her, washing her hands at the sink. She dried them on a hand towel that had a black wolf emblazoned on it. Jamie, eyes set on her phone screen, zoomed in on Vivian’s hands, on the rings, and snapped a picture of them. Vivian opened a drawer and turned around with a Luger pistol pointed at Jamie’s head. \n“Put down the phone.”\n“If I don’t?” Jamie asked. \nVivian stomped forward. Her eyes were ravenous. Jamie trembled in her chair, dropped the iPhone on the table, and raised her hands above her head. She did this because that’s what she saw people in Netflix shows do. She’d also seen actors put their phones on silent and hit the emergency button, calling out to 911. \n“Think you can just waltz into my home and make a fool of me and my boy?!” Vivian yelled. \n“Maybe.” \nJamie saw that Vivian was standing in front of the chair she’d recently pushed in. \n“Hey, you want to hear a joke?” Jamie asked. \n“Before I blow your brains out,” Vivian said. “Sure. Why not.” \n“How does the moon cut its hair?” \nVivian rolled her eyes; she went to reply, and… WHAM! Jamie kicked the chair as hard as she could into Vivian’s legs. Vivian crumpled and lost her grip on the Luger. It clattered on the floor as Jamie broke her glass in half on the table; the mouth of the glass was a squat and jagged pike. She charged Vivian and thrust the cutter into her neck. Hot blood squirted out, splashing Jamie’s face. \nVivian clawed at Jamie, trying to poke her in the eyes. Jamie turned her head, avoiding the gouging attack. She screamed into Vivian’s face, primal; it was the sound of vengeance. Jamie twisted the glass clockwise. Vivian’s bulging eyes twitched, her arms weakened, and her face drained of color. Blood dripped off Jamie’s face. The red dots, like rain, fell into Vivian’s open mouth, stippling her teeth. Finally, her hands dropped to her sides, and Ms. Caninus gurgled her last breath. \nJamie rolled off Vivian’s dead body and gaped at the ceiling from her back with tears in her eyes. Her sides were sore from the stamina needed to take a person’s life, and maybe she had broken a rib or two. She'd know for sure after the adrenaline fizzled out. \n“E-clips it,” Jamie said, “Get it? E-clips it.”  \nShe got back on her feet and patted the blood off her face with her shirt. The house was ghostly quiet. Suddenly, Jamie heard the ruckus of the garage door opening. Mr. Caninus was early to the dance. The cafeteria’s daily special was undercooked pork, which sent Mr. Caninus home with a smarting belly and a bottle of Pepto Bismol. Jamie stared at the Luger under the kitchen table. She dropped to her hands and knees and crawled to it. \nWith the pistol in her possession, she read the name inscribed on the wooden handle: B. Garwaf. Jamie recognized it, but she wasn’t sure from where. The answer would have to wait; the door to the garage had opened and shut. Mr. Caninus was inside 3178, and Jamie could hear him breathing in the hallway. She gripped the Luger so hard Jamie swore she heard one of her ribs pop. \n\nOfficer Archetti was the first responding officer to the “domestic disturbance” at 3178 Bates Street. When he pulled up to the home, he slammed on the brakes and put his cruiser in park. Archetti jumped out and unclipped his gun, all in the same motion. He called for backup when he saw the outline of a person who was in the fetal position.\nJamie was covered in blood, and bits of pink meat were clumped in her hair. A few feet from Jamie, the Luger was in a dormant rose bush. Archetti checked her pulse. It was faint, but it was there. \n“Stay with me,” Archetti said. \nHe made her promise, and Jamie did in a voice that sounded weak as a kitten. \nArchetti looked at the front door of 3178 and saw it was ajar. Streaks of fresh blood trickled down it. He knew he had to go in and handed Jamie a pen to grip with both hands. \n“Hold that thing like your life depends on it,” Archetti said. “Keep your eyes open, and do not fall asleep, okay?” \nJamie nodded and faintly said, “Okay.”\nOfficer Archetti kicked the front door back and poked his head in. The foyer was pitch black. He crossed his flashlight over his gun. A few strides into 3178, and Archetti stepped in something soft and gooey. His eyes tilted down. It was a tiny pile of brains. Archetti scanned, stopping on Mr. Caninus; he was face down in a pool of blood, and a chunk of his skull was missing. \nArchetti kneeled and probed for a sign of life. Mr. Caninus was already cold. Outside, Archetti could hear the sirens of the cavalry coming. He walked on. \nArchetti entered the kitchen and saw Vivian's bloodstained body on the floor. On the table, something glinted in the light shining in from the patio door. He walked to the table and saw two rings on a piece of yellow legal paper. They looked like engagement rings but lacked the wow factor. Archetti noticed that someone had written a message. He leaned over the note and read it to himself, “These rings belonged to Suzy Fallon and Kirk Wendle. The old bitch was wearing them. Check my social media to verify. I also have a picture on my phone. The passcode is 182281. I sent the beast to Hell. To All a Good Night, Jamie McCauley.” \n Archetti returned to Darcy Caninus’s body and eyed a lump around the buttocks. Presumably, it was a diaper full of shit, but there was no whiff of it in the air. Archetti glanced out the front door; officers were busy helping Jamie. He drummed his fingers against his badge and deliberated… sent the beast to Hell… \nArchetti removed his tactical knife and cut a line down the yoke of Mr. Caninus’s pants. He ripped the fabric apart and staggered back when a furry tail jumped out at him. Fuck! Archetti dusted off the scare and saw it was a dog’s tail. Darcy Caninus, with a helping hand from his mother, had sewed it to the skin around his tailbone. \nIn the attic of 3178, dozens of microcassette tapes would be found and boxed up and entered into evidence by the police. Months later, on a gray day in March, the recordings were played at the Harveston Police Station for a small pool of reporters. Archetti called in sick that day and visited Jamie. He had a gift for her. Two promise rings. \n"},"897":{"title":"I Thought I Was Attending a High School Reunion—But Something Was Wrong","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewmu53\/i_thought_i_was_attending_a_high_school\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"roracion","selftext":"The old school building hadn’t changed much in the ten years since we graduated. The paint was peeling, and the once-bright lockers were now a dull gray, but the memories came flooding back as soon as I walked through the doors. The reunion was supposed to be a celebration, a chance to reconnect with old friends, but something felt off the moment I stepped inside.\n\nThe hallways were dimly lit, the fluorescent lights flickering overhead. I found myself drawn to our old homeroom, the place where we’d all spent countless hours together. The door creaked as I pushed it open, and I was greeted by a wave of nostalgia.\n\nThe desks were still arranged in neat rows, just as they had been all those years ago. But when I looked closer, I noticed something strange—names carved into the wood, names that shouldn’t have been there. My name, and the names of my closest friends, etched deep into the surface, as if they’d been there for decades.\n\nA chill ran down my spine as I ran my fingers over the carvings. There was a date next to them: today’s date—***August 20, 2024.***\n\n\"Well, someone came here early and did some decorating...\" I thought to myself jokingly.\n\n**“Hey, you made it!”** A voice called from behind me, making me jump.\n\nI turned to see David, my best friend from high school, grinning at me. He looked exactly the same—same messy hair, same easy smile. But there was something in his eyes, something cold.\n\n“Yeah, couldn’t miss it for the world” I replied, forcing a smile. “Crazy seeing this place again, huh?”\n\nHe nodded, his grin never wavering. “Brings back memories, doesn’t it?”\n\nI nodded, but the unease was growing. “Where is everyone else?”\n\n“They’re coming,” David said, his tone too casual. “*They’ll be here soon.*”\n\nI tried to make small talk, but the room felt colder, the shadows growing longer with each passing second. I glanced at the clock on the wall, but the hands weren’t moving. They were stuck at 3:15—the exact time our last class had ended on the day we graduated.\n\nA sharp pain spiked through my temples, and suddenly, the memories didn’t just rush back—they slammed into me, vivid and terrifying. We were celebrating the end of senior year, our last night together. Someone had suggested we explore the old, unused wing of the school—a thrill-seeking adventure before we all parted ways.\n\nThe old science lab was filled with forgotten equipment, ancient textbooks, and yellowed papers. Someone, maybe it was David, found a box of old chemicals. We thought it would be funny to mix them, just to see what happened. We were too caught up in the excitement to think about the consequences.\n\nThe explosion was instant, violent—a blast of fire and smoke that swallowed the room whole. The old wooden beams above us caught fire almost immediately.\n\nWe tried to run, but the heat was unbearable, the flames spreading faster than we could move. One by one, my friends fell behind, choking on the smoke, tripping over debris. I can still hear their screams, see the terror in their eyes as they realized they couldn’t escape.\n\nIn my panic, I found a way out—a broken window at the far end of the corridor. I didn’t look back. I didn’t stop to help them. I just ran, stumbling through the shattered glass, the fire at my heels.\n\nThe building burned to the ground that night, and we never spoke of it again. We told everyone it was an accident, a tragic mistake. But deep down, we knew the truth—we’d left them to die.\n\n“I didn’t—” I started, guilt choking my words, but David cut me off.\n\n\"*We didn’t make it out either, don’t you get it?*” His voice rose, his eyes wide with a mix of desperation and fury. “*We died with them that night*. We’ve been stuck here, in this moment, waiting for you. Waiting for the last one to remember.”\n\nI stared at him, the realization hitting me like a punch to the gut. The memories were clear now—the flames, the smoke, the suffocating heat as we struggled to escape. But we hadn’t escaped. We had died with the others, and this reunion wasn’t a celebration. It was our prison.\n\nThe door slammed shut behind me, the lights flickering violently. I could hear voices now, distant at first, but growing louder, echoing through the halls. Our classmates—the ones who had perished in the fire—were coming. They were coming for me.\n\n“No,” I whispered, backing away, but David’s grip on my arm tightened.\n\n“There’s no running this time,” he said, his voice cold and final. “*We’re all in this together.*” He sang mockingly in an eerie, high-pitched tone that mimicked the old High School Musical lyrics, fashioning a sinister smile as he does it.\n\nThe walls began to close in, the flames from that night roaring back to life, licking at the edges of the room. The clock on the wall started ticking backward, faster and faster.\n\nMy friends, their faces twisted in pain, their clothes scorched, skin blackened and peeling, entered the room. They reached for me, their hands burning hot as they pulled me into the inferno. I scream in terror, genuinely in fear of the visual of burnt corpses wailing and getting their charred hands all over me. It felt like more coal than flesh, I—I felt sorry. Sorry for not remembering, sorry for keeping us in this hell. I closed my eyes, I've accepted my fate.\n\nThen...silence.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I was standing in front of the desk, my fingers tracing the familiar carvings on its surface. What the hell just happened? Had I been reading too much horror content on **Something Awful** and **4chan’s \/x\/** board? Or were the new pills I’d been prescribed, for my anxiety, contributing to my brain's inevitable deterioration?\n\nAs I continued to run my finger on the carving, my body suddenly ran cold as I realized what was etched on the wooden desk—***August 20, 2024.***\n\n*“Hey, you made it!”*"},"898":{"title":"Who wins?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewkok0\/who_wins\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Alastorawakening5","selftext":"K rool vs eyeless jack?"},"899":{"title":"Ike’s Magnificent Ice Cream ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ewkgvu\/ikes_magnificent_ice_cream\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Krllcrim","selftext":"Does anyone growing up in the 80’s and early 90’s remember Ike’s Magnificent Ice Cream???\n\n\nI grew up in a small town called Daledrift in Michigan and swear I remember this like it was yesterday.\nBasically it was similar to Showbiz Pizza or Chucke Cheese’s but with ice cream, and I think they may have also served hot dogs and doughnuts?\n\n\nI was never sure if this was corporate or local only.\n\n\nThere were no animatronics, just people dressed as ice cream cones that danced and lip synced songs on stage.\n\n\nIt also served as a pseudo daycare because I remember I and a couple of my friends were left there sometimes. Ike the Ice Cream Cone would watch over us and if we wanted let us sit in his lap in the photo booth, or go play with us in the arcade, or go watch movies with us in the TV room.\n\n\nSome of those movies were really scary and Ike made us promise not to tell anyone about them, kind of like keeping Faces of Death a secret from our parents as teenagers.\n\n\nI really wanna say we even stayed there overnight once, but this part is very hazy for some reason.\n\n\nHow it closed was very sad and tragic: something about the manager’s son found dead in the utility room there?

It was unlinked so nobody else watched it. IDK why this was sent to me, maybe he thought that I had a change of mind back then. I finally watched it on May when I had a change of mind. I thought that this was not shown to you guys mainly because it made fun of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe video starts off with SMG4 digging through his old memes. then SMG3 annoyed him with a full on Nuclear bomb he had for who knows how long. SMG4 hates it (as usual), and complains to SMG3 telling him that he was banned in several states because of that. When he walks to go check on Tari, he flash backs to the September 11 terrorists attack. He imagined it if you could do it to the U.K., so he lets SMG3 to terrorise Great Britain, along with him, shroomy, Boopkins, Bob, and Luigi. Then it cuts to Mario slapping Swag's and Chris' pingases. Then he sniffs some spaghetti which is in Tari's Room. Sooner or later his PINGAS gets caught by Tari's Mouth. He screams and begs it to stop, but Take can't open her mouth back up. This led to Mario and Tari to Fuse in to something. Swag and Chris escaped, but however took one look at what was Mario and Tari. It looked liked Tari with red Cat Ears and a red Cat tale. It also had Mario's Hat, and I swear I can see the robot arm replaced with a human one. It began biting Swag's balls off which was out of view. Chris began calling the Toads to stop this chaos. Then it cuts to London where SMG4 and SMG3 hijacked a Double Decker Bus, and some how make it fly. The Bus was headed for the twin Elizabeth towers. When the north one was hit, people were stunned. Another bus was hijacked by Bob and Boopkins, and it was headed to the south one. The final  hijack was by Shroomy and Luigi which blew up for no reason between the towers, and the fell. Strong survived but Luigi however fell unconscious. Then it cuts to black.\n\nA light appeared with Luigi in the middle. He was captured by the British Government. He was told if he had anything to do with the incident. He refused to talk, so he had to be lock up with his worst fear, women, specificly Meggy. it faded to black, then it showed what was the aftermath. Luigi and Meggy fused in to a women with fox ears and a fox tale.\n\nNow I could tell more but I have to see the Remastered 64 stupid Mario kart.

It's always horrid to see extremely old people who can't move so well and the first time I went inside her house, I saw leaflets for ending one's life in Switzerland.

The first thing the old lady had said to me was to bow down to the goddess statue in her front room. \n\nI had to tell her that I couldn't do that and that I was going to be busy cleaning her house and taking care of her. No matter what I did, she would just keep talking about the goddess statue. She would tell me how she use to bow down to it when she was younger, and the goddess statue would come alive and give her what she wanted. I just chalked it down to old age nonsense talk. Any how things calm down with her and I adapt to creating a routine for cleaning her house and looking after her. \n\nThen one night I find the old woman in the front room and she is just staring at the goddess statue. I ask her what she is doing and she tells me that she dropped something and it has gone under the statue. So I go down on my knees and I reach out for the thing she has dropped. Then I realised what I am doing and as I heard the goddess statue moving, I can hear the old lady doing some prayer. As my intentions is to just pick up an object under the statue, it's also a bow and the goddess statue came to life. \n\nIt asked the old woman what she wanted and she wanted her life to be taken by the goddess so that she could be with her.

The locals keep this terrifying legend a closely kept secret.\n\nYou can find the original story here: [The original story is really horrifying.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ja31g\/the_dupe_dog_a_story_from_haiti\/)\n\nHere's a passage that particularly had me on edge: \"I will always remember the way he started by saying the words \"it's like a dead thing\". Occasionally, people might see one lying in a remote field or in the woods. Mothers tell children never to go near one because it is dead, and you will get sick from being near it. It is something that people know about but don't discuss. Like an open secret in a small village.\n\nThey are described as a large, short haired dog. But the dog is long and can be 2 meters (about 6 feet) from the top of the head to the feet of the hind legs. The reason the length is measured in this way is because this creature walks on two legs. It is unclear what breed of dog it is (or was) but the face is hound-like and the body is skinny, like an animal that had starved to death\n\nThey might lay dormant for weeks or even months, their bodies slowly decaying in some remote place. When they are needed they can, supposedly, only be awakened by a powerful priest. They are said to have a master and belong only to that person. It is not well known why they are summoned or what their purpose is but in some cases they are sent to visit the house of someone who had committed some kind of wrong which had gone unpunished. For example, a dog was sent against a man who had supposedly been harassing the daughter of a very respected priest in his town.\""},"905":{"title":"Student Loan Debt is Not What You think (Part 2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ew83nl\/student_loan_debt_is_not_what_you_think_part_2\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"iifinch","selftext":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1eilnni\/student_loan_debt_is_not_what_you_think_it_is\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nI had 24 hours to save myself from a psychopathic monster who wanted to make me his living puppet because he bought my student loan debt. He had already controlled me once and I knew he would do it again.\n\nFortunately for me, I got a message from an old friend. His real name was something else but we all called him Blue.\n\n*Blue: Hey, trying to be brief*, *we don't know who's watching but you're not the only loser who couldn't cut it in grad school.*\n\n*Blue: possible solution... pack now, move quick here's the address*\n\nYou have no idea how excited I was. I did a fist pump like I just scored a bicycle on FIFA. Then I kept the celebrations going shouting. to the ceiling in defiance. Then, I immediately shut up because I realized Dummy could still take me. I still didn’t know how all of this worked. Still, anxiety flushed out of me. I wish Blue hadn't called himself a loser. Now I, was a loser. Blue absolutely was not. He was a champion in my book. He grew up in a town that Google Maps didn’t bother going to. He was so poor he didn't even have toys, he just played with his food and pretended they were VeggieTales. \n\nI still remember the first time he really saw a city. It was freshman year, we were coming back from dinner off-campus in Atlanta. His mouth hung open, and he couldn't stop laughing because he was enamored with what I had found so mundane, the simple city lights. I swear I saw him wipe away a tear. That was Blue, a man who could turn nothing into something and saw the beauty in everything.\n\n*Blue: And if you have weed, please bring it.*\n\nAnd that's probably why he got kicked out of his grad school. Blue had a serious drug problem in college and we were grateful he was only smoking weed now. I was saying he went through a lot to get to where he is, so he likes to forget a lot as well, and unfortunately for him that meant smoking a lot.\n\nI had no weed or other drugs or even Truly's. I thought sobriety might help my law school experience. Apparently, it didn't and apparently, I'm the only lawyer who thinks so. My classmates did whatever they wanted and still scored better than I did. So, I packed my bags and wrestled with the guilt of not telling my parents I was leaving, maybe forever.\n\nMy mom would never stop calling and she would move heaven and Earth to find out where I was. I imagined her up all night, scrolling through her phone, googling my name again and again hoping for any leads.\n\nAnd my Dad... we did fight but I knew he loved me. He would probably message random people on social media with my same name because he didn't know how social media worked.\n\nHow frustrating would that be? How sad.\n\nI couldn't do that.\n\nI wrote a note saying I was moving out for a bit to focus on myself before I had exams. It was stupid but they might believe it. I just wanted them safe and happy more than anything.\n\nI met Blue around one at a coffee shop. The drive over was hectic because I was afraid for some reason I would miss him or he’d ditch me. Despite Blue’s love for me and despite him never doing anything of that sort.\n\nI rushed in. Visible tension drew every eye in the room to my friend’s in the corner. Blue had just told them the plan for how we would escape Dummy. \n\nThere were four of them. Three were sitting, and one (Nadia) paced the floor, yelling at Blue who sat in a beanbag chair in the middle. It was apparent Nadia hated Blue’s plan for escape.\n\n\"No,\" Nadia said to Blue. \n\nI didn't talk to her much in undergrad. I wasn't cool enough. I remember her because of her beads. She always had these long dangling braids with beads in them. On both wrists, she had thick, hand-woven bracelets, usually of a darker shade. As well as her iconic waist beads. We weren't close but I remember Blue jokingly asking if she owned a single shirt that covered her stomach. She said no and winked.\n\nThat day, the beads rattled as her hair bounced, her shoulders shrugged, and her arms waved in an expressive rainbow of anger. All of the rattles sounded like summer rain on a metal roof.\n\n\"No, no, and no,\" she said. She pointed one wrathful finger at Blue. \"You're an idiot!\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\" Blue said, and the whole room waited for his answer.\n\n\"But, what?\" Nadia demanded.\n\nBlue shrugged and Blue laughed with the boyish optimistic nihilism he had in undergrad, a \"what's the worst that can happen\" chuckle. \n\n\"Nadia,\" Ruth hopped in. Ruth was Hispanic and friends and enemies alike called her AOC or Madam President. She took it as a compliment, she wanted to be President one day so she saw it as prophetic. \"Yes, a lot of Blue's choices are...interesting,\" she said politically. \"but this idea is good. You know I take myself seriously. You can trust me.\"\n\nNadia rolled her eyes. Ruth's mouth dropped.\n\n\"Ruth,\" Nadia said. \"You're the worst one. You take yourself so seriously and yet you're as screwed as the rest of them. That one could actually do something if he wasn't a junkie, \" she pointed to Blue and then flicked her head back to Ruth. The beads sounded like a rattlesnake’s rattle. \"You try as hard as you can and still fail. I mean, look at you. You want to be AOC but you dress like Hilary Clinton. \n\nRuth squirmed in her pantsuit and I had never seen her try to make herself so small.\n\n\"And you.\" she pointed to Leon, a heavy-set guy with glasses and the nicest guy you'll meet. His eyes were lowered until he was called on. He gave her a look like he was begging to be spared, from whatever abuse she would fling on him.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Leon said without committing a sin. Nadia didn't care.\n\n\"You, fat fuck. How are we going to take you anywhere?\"\n\nLeon went back to staring at the floor.\n\n\"That's enough,\" I butted in, pissed off for Leon's sake.\n\n\"And you!\" she whirled to me and the anger in her eyes matched my own rage, I didn't back down but braced myself to be cut down. \"I don't even know you,\" she said, and with one hand pushed me aside.\n\nShe stomped to the door before Blue called out to her.\n\n\"Where are you going, Nadia? We don't have any other choice.\"\n\nNadia stopped and considered.\n\n\"I'm going home because this isn't happening.\"\n\n\"Nadia,\" Blue said. \"You can't ignore this. I can see the marks on your arms. The marks where Dummy took over your body. You’ve got the same ones we all have. It is happening. You can't ignore this.\"\n\n\"Then, it won't be that bad.\"\n\n\"Nadia,  it won't be that bad? He wants to put strings in our skin. He wants us to be slaves.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" she said.\n\n\"Nadia, this is happening.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" she yelled and her eyes went red.\n\nAnd then I understood, it was either be mean or be afraid with her. She wasn't evil. She knew what she was saying was cruel but like an adopted kitten in a new home, she had to bite someone, because the outside world was so scary.\n\nTruth is, we've all been there, whether we want to admit it or not. We've all hurt someone because we were afraid to be hurt. So, I forgave her and walked toward her, and extended my hand for a handshake.\n\n\"Hey, Nadia. I'm Douglas. We actually met a couple of times in undergrad, it's fine you don't remember me but I've got those same bumps on my skin that you do.\" I pulled up my sleeve to show them. \"I know Blue is unorthodox, but we've got to trust him. Dummy is coming for us; it will be terrible, and we have to do something.\"\n\nDummy's strings pulsed inside me.\n\n*Flap*.\n\n*Flap*.\n\n*Flap*.\n\nLike thick, muscle-bound worms inside my skin they wanted to come out, not a crack, not a slice but a slow, painful progression. *For him, wasn't pain the point?* Was he already controlling us then? Maybe internally choosing who would stay and who would go? That's what I prefer to tell myself these days, I don't believe it. \n\n\"No,\" she said and walked out the door. I wish that was the last time I saw her.\n\nI sighed and moseyed over to Blue and company.\n\nBlue stood up and shrugged and I stuck out my hand for a handshake. He pushed it out of the way for a hug. Of course, I embraced him back and felt silly for offering my hand. Blue might as well have been my brother.\n\n\"You been good?\" he said post-embrace.\n\n\"What? No, I got kicked out of law school, and then someone sold my soul.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" Blue shrugged and gave me that smile full of optimistic nihilism. \"You know everybody?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" I said and walked over to Leon. He bungled up, shame keeping him wobbly. I was sure to embrace him in a hug, hoping to make up for Nadia's earlier disrespect.\n\n\"Leon Osbury,\" I said, \"Best researcher I ever met in a class full of history junkies.\" \n\nLeon blushed and told me thank you, I moved over to Ruth. I know she would want a handshake so I stuck mine out.\n\n\"Madame President,\" I said. Her genuine smile flashed showing her teeth before switching to her rehearsed one. \"I trust Blue just came up with the plan and you'll be leading us?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said.\n\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way,\" I said, and I meant it. I understand Nadia's fear but I didn't like how she called them losers. Now, I was a loser but them no, they should never feel that way.\n\n\"Speaking of plans here's ours,\" Blue said.\n\n\"Take a seat, man,\" Leon said and I did.\n\n\"Okay,\" Blue started. \"So, thanks to Leon researching for hours I think I know how Dummy operates now. \n\n“1. He will only attack us again once the 24 hours are up.\n\n“2. His strings can only come from a man-made material that is directly above our heads. So, we have to avoid roofs or any shelter above us but trees are fine. Also, again it has to be covering your head so we can stand beside a pole but can’t go under a streetlamp.\n\n“3. His deal is with the US government and the US government only if we go out of the country we'll be safe.\n\nSo... we're going to Mexico?\"\n\n\"Mexico?” I laughed because the idea was absurd. “How? Every car, every bus has a roof and---\"\n\nBlue motioned for me to calm down.\n\n\"Madame President helped with that. She worked every connection she had She had to get us e-bikes, a path to illegally get us into Mexico, and a temporary place to stay once we got there. The girl's made to be a politician.\"\n\n\"I hope you can excuse the bags under my eyes,\" she said, \"I tried to cover them with makeup. I was up all night working every favor I had. I chose e-bikes because regular gas stations have a cover his strings could come from.\"\n\n\"That's brilliant. Wow, yeah thanks. I can't believe it... Mexico?\"\n\n\"Yeah... We won't stay there forever but it gives us a chance to strategize and find something better.\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" I said.\n\n\"Rule number 4 though,” Blue said. “He's in your bones now once he knows you're trying to escape he'll try to stop you. He'll stalk us to the border. Are you still in?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nHunted by a monster, and sold out by our country, we rode our bikes through the scenic routes on pretty spring days that made none of that matter and made us say God Bless the US of A.\n\nWe raced through neighborhoods, ordered door dash everywhere, drank beers in parks, and saw our country. Americana is what I think it's called. Some things that are strictly American. I'm talking about Waffle House, college sports, and Breaking Bad. Dummy did ruin it because he's a monster, but I loved it until then.\n\nWe slept in trailer park parking lots and were even invited inside by a local. We declined because Dummy would have gotten us, but we told her we were declining because Leon had OCD and was afraid to go inside.\n\nShe came back with plastic baggies of fried chicken and Tupperware of macaroni. As well as a Bible and a couple of tracts to evangelize us.\n\nShe said, \"There's nothing in there,” she pointed at Leon’s head. “That can't be healed by what's in here,\" she waved the Bible twice. None of us were religious but we kept the Bible out of respect. Then she looked at me, which was odd because I wasn't the one faking a mental illness. Her green eyes ate up every moment, her aged skin folded into a frown so intense it could make a statue shake.\n\n\"And you,\" she said, \"You gotta believe or you'll be damned.\" I wanted to assume that was just the ravings of an evangelical but days later after the food was gone and the image of her face withered in my imagination, her words didn't, she put her soul quicker in those words.\n\n\"Believe or be dammed.\" I would wake up in puddles of sweat because I knew she meant something that was coming far quicker than Hell or Heaven. *But what?*\n\nWe pulled over and stopped at every odd and beautiful landmark on our way to Mexico from North Carolina. Poverty Point National Monument, The Georgia Guide Stones, Congaree National Park, and the Ballantyne Monuments ( we couldn’t go on highways so we ended up in some random spots) and many more.\n\nWe pulled over to one of those cheap plastic amusement parks. You've passed them if you're from the Midwest or South sorry, West Coast. They're strange patches of land that had to be popular in other eras. They're on the sides of highways in middle-of-nowhere towns, drive too fast and you'll pass it, but if you only had one eye you wouldn’t miss it.\n\nIt's a patch of green grass stuffed with giant plastic animals and you're supposed to pay to drive through it. Sometimes the plastic giants have a theme like Christmas, this one was animals, that were on the borderline of copyright infringement.\n\nWe paid the $20 a person to enter the park but of course, before we went in Blue really wanted to smoke and on the rare occasion we all joined him this time. The kid (and only worker) at the park smelled it on us and asked for a hit this gave Blue free reign to get high out of his mind. Which was fine for a while because we were having the time of our lives.\n\nBlue begged for us to take a picture of him offering a tree-size gorilla a blunt. We obliged and laughed all the way.\n\nRuth posed genuinely red-eyed and genuinely demure beside a knockoff Godzilla and did her hair and pressed her suit, apparently, she was a real fan of the creature.\n\nLeon climbed in the hands of Minnie and Micky Mouse and posed like a child. It was the funniest thing I had seen in years. He made us swear to not post the pictures.\n\nIt was all so stupid, so silly, so fun, so America that we all walked around forgetting Dummy and his strings could come from anything above us. How unfair.\n\nThe first bad weather of our trip came in a storm. Thunder bashed the world. Lightning hounded it in only seconds. Rain lashed in, beating our skin and flooding the land. Leon tried to pull a passed-out, smoked-filled, and happy Blue up. He resisted half-awake choosing to dream in the grass instead.\n\n“Leave him,” Ruth had to yell because the plopping of the rain canceled out so much noise. “He’ll be fine it’s just rain. The lightning will hit one of the statues before him.” Madame President herself scanned the area for where we should shelter. Of course, we knew the small shack they had for ice cream and restrooms was out of the question. But we were high, too high, so we didn’t think about how dangerous everything else could be.\n\nOn the far end of the park, the villain side of the park, stood a giant mummy with its hand extended out, like it was trying to grab you.  \n  \n“We can stay dry under there!” Ruth yelled over the thunder and pointed toward the mummy statue.\n\nIt seemed so odd. Stereotypically weed is supposed to make you more paranoid, but stoners will tell you it depends on the strand. Blue gave us a strand full of bliss and it was such a mistake. I finally felt content; all of my anxiety and self-hate left.\n\nUnfortunately, that made it hard to think. The three of us stumbled into the villain side of the park. It was fated to happen this way I suppose. Ruth loved the weird and the strange and that which made our skin crawl.\n\nPlastic dark lions, snakes, wolves, spiders, crows\/ravens, bats, rats, sharks, black cats, owls,  and hyenas stood at the side and watched us descend into a massive mistake.\n\nI caught the eyes of the off-brand Other Mother to my left from the story Coraline, a childhood fear of mine. A knockoff Wicker Man, a giant humanoid statue, where human sacrifices were made inside of stood to my right and I felt as if it mocked me and that shook me to my core.\n\n“Guys, you’re falling behind you’re making me nervous,\" Ruth shouted from the front.\n\nOur thoughts treaded over time, unable to stabilize, and much less articulate. Blue's perfect strand of anxiety-melting weed put a wall over any thought that screamed danger was near. My mouth hung open and I even drooled a bit as I watched Ruth's hair bounce ahead of me. A storm cloud rolled above us and thunder smacked the summer day.\n\n\"You’re all so quiet,\" Ruth said dreamily.\n\n20 steps away from the massive Mummy we walked beside smaller statues of knock-off villains. Clowns and dragons and spacemen and witches. 15 steps away and we saw in what we thought was a single dark purple string under the hands of the mummy. 10 steps away and the Thunder rolled, as if in a warning. 5 steps away and it didn't matter. We were close enough. She was close enough.\n\n“Guy’s wait,” Ruth said, a step inside the finger of the Mummy. “Does this count as shelter?”\n\nBefore we can answer that single string whipped into action. It latched onto her tongue and pulled. As rain came down her tongue swung up. High, high, and higher still into the Mummy's hand and disappeared into darkness. More strings came for her, but she had the presence of mind to roll away.\n\nShe turned to us. Red poured out like a waterfall mixing with the clear celestial rain making it seem like some strange Kool-aid.\n\nShe moaned and groaned in sounds that would be as foreign to her as they were to us. *Imagine having to scream without a tongue.* She felt it each time she made a noise, I saw new hopelessness dilate her eyes. They became wider, bigger, and more empty with each futile noise that came from her mouth. Ruth was a smooth-talker, a future politician, and Madame President. She lost her one gift the thing that got her this far; she lost her voice.\n\nShe faced us and we held her arms. She turned around to go back under the hand that could save her. We pulled her back.\n\n“It’s gone, Ruth!” I yelled. “We have to leave! C’mon!”\n\nWe rushed to Blue and our bikes. The rain did some good and had him partially awake. I smacked him twice for the other part. We got on our bikes and tore down the street, but what was the point? Dummy stole Ruth’s voice.  He was winning. Too bad he wasn’t done."},"906":{"title":"The Dinner Party","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ew5cu5\/the_dinner_party\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"throwtheflames123","selftext":" \n\n**\\~The Dinner Party\\~**\n\n \n\n**\\~The Journey\\~**\n\n“We will be there in 10 minutes, darling.”\n\nThe sound of my husband’s voice stirs me from the light slumber I had slipped into during the car journey. His voice sounds distant, muffled by the heavy cloak of coming out of sleep. I open my eyes to the view of speedily passing traffic out of the passenger window. I wince as I shift uncomfortably out of the slumped position I had fallen into in the cramped car. As my hands fall into my lap and I yawn, I admire the colour of my newly painted fingernails, twiddling my fingers and enjoying the way that my peach-coloured nails compliment my cream dress.\n\n \n\n“Did you have a nice sleep?” Jason says, with a loving smile.\n\n“Yeah - there’s something about long car journeys which always makes me drift off.” I say, smiling back.\n\nThis was partly true, but I don’t admit to the real reason why I am so tired. I had barely slept the previous night, due to the anticipation of meeting all of Jason’s childhood friends at the dinner party we are going to tonight. I am not the most social person at the best of times, and the thought of meeting 4 new people all at once kept me awake with anxiety. Jason, being an extrovert and self-proclaimed ‘life of the party’ has never understood my social anxiety and I have long stopped sharing this with him, to avoid the inevitable light-hearted teasing.\n\n \n\nWe are going to the house of Jason’s friends  - David and his wife Linda. He grew up together with David as his best friend in Cornwall, but fell out of touch shortly after he moved to Bristol in his early twenties.\n\n \n\nBristol is where Jason and I had met and fallen in love. It was a whirlwind romance, he proposed just 4 months after we started dating. I have no clue what Jason ever saw in me, I was a mousy and meek librarian – an introverted and socially awkward recluse when he first met me. He was a confident, popular and gorgeous man who probably had a long line of single women desperate to date him. But we clicked the instant we met, and Jason had never made me feel ‘beneath’ him or not worthy of him. I love him for that.\n\n \n\n Now, 3 years later, we are on our way to meet them along with Adam and his wife Jane – Another friend that Jason had fallen out of touch with. After recently connecting again over social media, it was to be a reunion of sorts. 3 months ago, an invitation dropped through our letter box. It was black in colour, adorned with fancy gold writing that said:\n\n \n\n***Dear Jason and Emily,***\n\n***We cordially invite you to dine with us on the 8******^(th)*** ***of June, 6pm.***\n\n***We are so looking forward to dining with you.***\n\n***From Linda and David***\n\n \n\nI turn it over, on the back of the invitation is a logo that states “*Sponsored by The Company.”*\n\n \n\n“How formal.” I had said dryly, secretly hoping that the couple would not turn out to be as cold and snobbish as they had sounded in the invitation.\n\nJason laughed lightly, “They have a lot of money but, David’s very down to earth. He hasn’t always been wealthy – far from it in fact. You will like him.”\n\n“Let’s hope so.” I teased.\n\n \n\nGradually, the wide and busy motorway narrowed into a series of small country lanes, surrounded on both sides by thick trees and hedges. As we drove deeper into the countryside, the overhanging trees seemed to darken the inside of the car and gave me an uneasy feeling. It felt like we were leaving the light of civilisation and safety and entering a darker world of the unknown. I shook this feeling and wrapped my cardigan more tightly around my shoulders.\n\n \n\n**\\~Arrival drinks\\~**\n\nEventually, we turned left and pulled into a gravel driveway that led up to tall black iron gates that surrounded the house of Linda and David. We stopped outside the gate, Jason leaning out of the window to press the intercom button. As he stretched his arm towards the call button, his shirt lifted slightly and I noted his toned physique. I suppress a sigh. Jason had effortlessly kept his near-perfect body throughout our 3-year marriage, whereas I felt fatter than ever.\n\n \n\nEveryone always warns you; ‘once you are married, you’ll let things go!’. I didn’t think I had been eating more than usual, but over the last few months I have seemed to have gone up at least a dress size. Last week, I was choosing an outfit from my wardrobe to wear for the upcoming dinner party. When I stepped into my old reliable cocktail dress, I struggled to pull it over my hips and then caught the zip in a roll of belly fat. I huffed in frustration, blowing out a strand of loose hair that had fallen into my face. Jason had walked into the room as I stood looking disapprovingly at myself in the mirror, running a hand over my previously flat stomach.\n\n“How have I gained so much weight? This dress fit me at Christmas.” I sighed.\n\nJason smiled sympathetically.  “Who cares? You are beautiful. There’s just a little bit more to love now.” He winks and places and kiss on the top of my shoulder.\n\n“I blame you – it’s the treats you bring me.” I scold him, but lighten my accusation with a smile.\n\nThroughout our relationship, Jason always brightened my day by bringing home the odd treat here and there. Recently I have been working later than usual at the library, and so he has often called up to offer to pick up a pizza so that I don’t have to cook. I suppose these small treats have begun to take their toll on my figure.\n\n“Okay, you got me!” Jason said, “no more treats for Emily!” He makes a show of waggling his finger at his reflection in the mirror.\n\n \n\nJason slides back into his seat as the intercom buzzes and the gates open up slowly. We peel through the gates and into the driveway. It’s almost the size of a car park, decorated with stone statutes and a beautiful fountain in the middle, with colourful flowers lining the space. We park up and get out of the car, stretching out our muscles after the long journey.\n\nI look around me and take in the stunning surroundings. “I didn’t realise Linda and David were so –“\n\n“Disgustingly rich?” Jason replies.\n\nMy cheeks flush slightly. “Well, I wasn’t going to phrase it *quite* like that.”\n\n“They haven’t always been this wealthy. David came into some money a few years ago. Lucky investments, I think.” Jason says, as he takes my hand and leads me up the stone steps to the front door. He rings the bell as he adjusts the collar on his shirt. I notice a bead of sweat on his forehead, wondering if he is also feeling a little anxiety too. Maybe he isn’t as extroverted as he seems to be, I think to myself. I pull at the side of my dress, feeling self-conscious about how it clings to my stomach, despite buying a size up from my usual clothes.\n\n \n\nThe door opens and greeting us is the smiling Linda and David. They look like a couple on the front of a magazine.\n\n“Jason!” They exclaim in unison. Linda’s eyes draw towards me and she says “You must be Emily. So lovely to meet you.” I watch as her eyes look over me from head to toe, taking me in. For a split second, I assume she is judging my slightly portly stature in the way that some women are prone to do. However, the expression on her face is not one of judgment, it’s an expression I can’t place. Amusement? Curiosity? *Anticipation?* She has the look that a hopeful child may have when a tray of cookies is brought into a room. I shake off an uncomfortable feeling and extend my hand, “and you as well.” I smile.\n\n \n\nLinda looks back to Jason and draws him into a hug, and then Jason reaches out a hand to David. Jason and David exchange a look, again with expressions I cannot put into words. What is going on here, and why does this feel uncomfortable?\n\n \n\nWe step into the hall, and are led down the long hallway, as lavishly decorated as the driveway. We are shown into the sitting room where Adam and Jane are seated, nestling a gin and tonic in their hands. Adam is tall with a kind, tanned face. He has short black hair that sticks up in tufts, presumably from a lifetime of running his hands through his hair – a nervous habit he displays when he holds out his hand. His wife, Jane, is much smaller and has a slim build. I feel even more self-conscious as my eyes scan over her toned body, and I notice a very pretty tattoo of a love heart on her slender ankle. Exclaims of “so good to see you!” and “it’s been far too long!” are exchanged between us and the two couples. I shake off whatever uncomfortable feeling I had and admonish myself for being overly paranoid. Of course, things would feel strange at first, they haven’t seen each other in the flesh for over 8 years.\n\n \n\n*In the flesh.*\n\nWhy does that phrase come to mind? Why does it linger there and bring back that familiar feeling of unease?\n\n \n\n“A drink, Emily?” David’s voice breaks through the disconcerting thoughts in my mind. I snap back to the present moment and realise he has had his hand out offering a glass of champagne for an awkwardly long time whilst I was zoned out. The others in the room stare at me, perplexed. My cheeks redden and I apologise, taking the glass from him and nodding my thanks. Jason places a reassuring hand on the small of my back, the warmth from his touch bringing me a sense of calm.\n\n \n\n“Right, now we are all settled. I would like to go over the rules of the dinner party.” David stands at the centre of the circle we have formed in the room, looking at each of us. “Linda and I believe in the importance of living in the moment, so we insist that you place your phones in this basket for the duration of the evening”. At first, I think he is joking and I let out a small laugh, expecting the rest of the guests to laugh along with me.\n\n \n\nHowever, no one has laughed. Jason is nodding and is already placing his phone into the basket. Adam and Jane exchange a nervous glance, but smile politely and dutifully place their devices in. David turns to me, holding out the basket. I hesitate for a moment, looking to Jason. He nods encouragingly but doesn’t smile. I fumble inside my clutch bag, locating my phone and reluctantly place it in the pile. There is a sense, maybe a trace left over from early human survival, that placing my phone there has set some kind of horrible wheel in motion. That this action has been a grave mistake. Like the feeling you get when you feel a stranger looking at you, or the leap in your stomach when you find an unexpected gap when walking down the stairs. The innate sense that danger is imminent and you must choose fight or flight. I shake this thought from my mind.\n\n \n\n“The second – and final – rule is that you must eat everything on your plate.” David says. “It’s more than simple politeness, but we firmly believe that no food should go to waste. So please, do try to eat everything on your plate.”\n\nI was starting to dislike David and his silly dinner party rules. What kind of arrogant host confiscates your phone and then tells you that you should eat everything like you are a child? Once again try to catch Jason’s eye, to see if he is witnessing what I am – but his eyes remain fixed on David.\n\n \n\n“That’s all. Now, please follow us into the dining room and the party can begin.” David gestures behind him and the double doors open to reveal a large oak dining table, adorned with glistening silverware and luxurious gold napkins. Around the sides of the room are hired staff, who are standing to attention with white cloths draped neatly over their arms.\n\n \n\nAdam and Jane follow David, their eyes wide with amazement. “Christ Dave – when you told me you had come in to some money I didn’t realise you had *this* much!” Adam exclaims. He holds out the chair for Jane and they both sit down. Linda walks quickly into the room, her high heels click-clacking on the marble floor.\n\n“Before you get too comfortable Jane, you must come with me to see the garden before it gets dark. Adam tells me you also have a green thumb, and I must get your feedback on my rose bushes!”. Jane looks surprised, and rises to follow Linda out of the room. Linda casts a look over her shoulder as they exit the room and calls in a sing-song voice, “We won’t be long, the first course will come out soon!”.\n\n \n\nThe double doors close firmly behind them, leaving myself and the remaining guests in the room. I glance out of the panelled windows into the garden, watching as Linda and Jane walk towards the rose bushes. Linda is gesturing towards a red rose bush, talking excitedly as Jane nods, casting a look behind her towards the house. I look back to the table, but I am only half-listening to the polite small talk around the table.\n\n \n\n“So.” Adam says to David. “What is your secret to your newfound wealth then?” He asks the question as if he is not interested in the answer. Like David’s reply is intended only to impress the women in the room. I stifle an eye-roll.\n\nDavid smiles. “Well, I work for a company who pay extremely well.”\n\n“What work do you do for them?” I say, now intrigued.\n\n“Selling a kidney to them, I’d imagine.” Adam interjects dryly, taking a sip of his drink.\n\n \n\nDavid throws a look to Adam, almost imperceptible. He quickly lightens his face and laughs, moving the conversation on. “You both know about my gambling problems when we were younger.” He looks to Adam and Jason. They both avert their eyes to the table and nod.\n\n“Well, I’m ashamed to say it got worse. We lost our savings and were just days from being homeless. Until The Company came along and offered a new life in exchange for me carrying out their requests.”\n\n“Their requests?” I ask.\n\n“They request things, and I deliver. Now, enough about me. Catch me up on how things are, both of you”.\n\n \n\nAdam and Jason take it in turns to update David on their lives. Once again, my eyes drift over to the window that overlooks the garden. I notice that Jane is no longer in the garden, and instead Linda is stood at the window. She is staring into the dining room. Is she staring at me? No. It’s now dark outside, so she must be looking at her own reflection in the window. She is straightening her dress, running a hand through her hair to place the strands of curls perfectly onto her shoulders. She smiles.\n\n \n\nWhere is Jane? I think to myself.\n\n \n\n**\\~The First Course\\~**\n\nLinda has now joined us at the table. I look behind her, through the partially opened double doors and expect to see Jane following. She does not appear. I turn to Linda and ask, “Where did Jane get to?”.\n\nLinda smiles tightly, “She went to the bathroom to freshen up before dinner. She will be with us very shortly.” Adam raises his eyebrows at the mention of his wife’s name, but then returns to his conversation about the football results with David and Jason.\n\n \n\nFrom the kitchen, we hear a bell ring.\n\n“Ah!” David exclaims, “The first course is ready.”\n\nThe staff enter the room carrying 5 plates covered with silver cloches. They place them gently in-front of us, and lift the cloche in unison to reveal the meal. Around the table are a series of “Oohs” and “Ahs” as we stare down at a plate of tartare decorated with beautiful edible flowers. Around the table the staff scatter rose petals as we eagerly pick up our cutlery and begin eating.\n\n“Steak tartare! My favourite.” Adam says. He adds, “Should we wait for Jane before we start?”\n\nI look up and it dawns on me that the staff had only carried out 5 plates. I look towards the empty space on table where Jane sat. I also notice that there is no cutlery placed at her seat. A feeling of unease rises inside me and any feelings of hunger are quickly disappearing.\n\n“I didn’t want to embarrass Jane, but she said she had drunk far too much gin and needed a lie down for a while. She insisted we start without her.” Linda says. Adam looks confused and says “That’s odd, I didn’t notice her drinking very much. I will go and check on her.” He begins to stand up and David reaches out his hand to place on Adam’s arm.\n\n“Check on her after the first course. Our chef is extremely eager for you to try the food.” He looks intently at Adam, who hesitates at first but sits back down, not wanting to offend the hosts.\n\n \n\nI look down at my plate again. And then more closely. *Is this steak?*\n\n \n\nI try to think back to previous times when I have eaten steak tartare. I remembered it being a deep red colour, but the meat I am looking at now looks similar to pork mince. They wouldn’t have served us raw pork, surely?\n\nAround me, the rest of the table have dug in to their meal. Placing the meat into their mouths and chewing loudly and contently. I slowly pick up my fork and place it into the centre of the tartare, picking around the small pieces of meat, trying to find the smallest piece to try. As the fork reaches the centre of the mound, the smaller pieces fall out of the mound and spread around the plate. I pick out one of the pieces and spear it with my fork. The fork meets some resistance but it eventually pierces through, making a squelching noise that makes the hair on my arms stand up. I raise the fork to my mouth slowly but then stop abruptly. I see a row of small hairs on the meat.\n\n \n\nI try to ignore the sudden urge to gag, and pull back my fork and examine the meat. I think back to when I cook chicken at home. Sometimes there are hair-like strands on the skin before it’s cooked? I cock my head, so maybe it’s chicken? Again, why would they serve us raw chicken?\n\n \n\nConfused, I put down the fork with a fumbling clatter and the motion causes other pieces of meat to roll all over the plate. One piece flips up, skin side facing up. I stare again, in white hot horror this time.  \n\n \n\nDespite the dim candlelit room, I can see clearly what is on the piece of meat. A small black love heart. I immediately recognise what it is, as I saw it just half an hour ago. A love heart tattoo. Jane’s love heart tattoo.\n\n \n\nEvery muscle in my body is tense and ready for me to bolt out of the room. All I would need to do is use my arms to push away from the table, use my knees to stand up, grab Jason’s hand and run out of the double doors, through the sitting room, along the hallway and out of the doors. Jump in the car and –\n\n \n\nAnd then what? The gate is locked.\n\n \n\nMy body freezes. Despite my brain screaming at me to stand up and run, every inch of my body feels frozen in place.\n\n \n\n5 plates came out for a dinner party of six. 5 plates. Of course Jane didn’t have the first course – she WAS the first course.\n\n \n\nI look around the room, desperately searching for some kind of explanation. A burst of laughter maybe, a cruel prank having come to its climax – pork meat stamped with a heart shape served to me. Soon David and Linda would laugh hysterically, apologise for the practical joke and Jane would emerge from the garden, laughing hard. But no laughter came.\n\n \n\n All I see is David and Linda, now scraping their plate with their forks, scooping up the last remains of the meat and stuffing the it into their mouths. All I hear is lips smacking, agonising chewing noises and the squeak of teeth scraping against skin. *Human skin.*\n\n \n\nMy eyes turn to Jason and Adam. Surely, they have worked it out by now too. Jason is chewing obediently, placing small pieces at a time into his mouth. I realise with horror he hasn’t realised. Jason is too kind, too polite to kick up a fuss and question his hosts’ tastes. He is probably eating it out of politeness, assuming it is an exotic meat. Adam is not eating the meat, instead pushing his fork around his plate, opting to eat the edible flowers.\n\n \n\n*Flowers.* I look around at the rose petals on the table. Is this a sick joke? Jane loved gardening and so they serve her body up with petals. I gag once again, swallowing down bile in my throat.\n\n \n\nI hear a silence, a fork placed down on crockery. “Emily – you’re not eating?”.\n\nI look up to find the source of the question. David.\n\nI swallow weakly. “No, I’m not eating this.” I meet his stare. I feel my heart beat throughout my whole body.\n\n“You must eat everything on your plate, Emily. Those are the rules.” David asserts.\n\nI am lost for words. What is happening? We need to escape.\n\n \n\nI reach for my clutch bag, realising immediately my phone has been taken away. All of our phones have. There is no way to call for help. I think about the locked gate. If we made it out of the house, how would we get past the gates to the property? I desperately try to picture the entrance hallway when we came in. Was there a control panel next to the door that controls the gates? Would I have time to unlock it before they got to me?\n\n \n\nI realise that grabbing Jason and running out of the gates would be impossible. All that would happen would be getting caught and possibly killed. If I rouse suspicion or tell Jason what is happening, they could kill us both. I’m going to have to find an excuse to go to the bathroom. Maybe find an open window and climb out. I could claim I am feeling sick and ask Jason to come with me to the bathroom and then explain everything.\n\n \n\n“Well?” David says.\n\nAdam and Jason have looked up at their meals to stare at me. Linda smiles.\n\nI stammer, “I – I am not feeling well. I can’t eat anything, I’m very sorry David and Linda.”\n\nDavid’s eyes darken and he places his hands under his chin in a clasp. He nods to the staff, who walk to the double doors and close them with a bang, looping a padlock across the handle. David’s hands move seamlessly to his jacket inside pocket and he withdraws a pistol and places it gently on the table. “Eat.” He nods to my plate.\n\n \n\n“Come on Dave, you never said we had to eat too.” Adam says, looking nervously between the pistol and myself.\n\n“Oh shut it Adam, unless you don’t want to be paid.” David slams his fist down on to the table. Adam jumps and draws into himself like a wounded animal, placing his head in his hands and slumping onto the table.\n\nI blink back tears. My heart beats in my throat. *Did he say paid?* Are we being paid to be here?\n\nI look at Jason in desperation. His face looks blank with fear. He is stunned into a whisper.\n\n“Do what David says, Emily. Please.” He nods towards the pistol, which David now has pointed at me.\n\nMy voice shaking, I whisper back “Do you know what we are eating, Jason?”\n\nHe doesn’t answer. He just closes his eyes tightly. He places his hand over mine. “If we do what he says, we will have more chance of escaping.”\n\n \n\nNothing makes any sense. Is this Jason’s plan? We eat the meal and then they will suddenly allow us to leave? Is he really such a coward? I’m left with no options.\n\n \n\nA click of the gun as the safety is released. “Final chance, Emily.” David says.\n\n \n\nI pick up the fork with a trembling hand and almost drop it as I pierce through a piece of human meat. I close my eyes, which are brimming with tears. I imagine I am eating steak. I bring the meat to my lips and every fibre of my body is resisting my mouth from opening. It’s like the signals sent from my brain are not reaching my lips to part open.\n\n“NOW!” I hear David shout.\n\nI squeeze my eyes shut and quickly place the meat in my mouth. I begin to chew. The texture is sinewy and tastes like rubber. I sob and place my forehead in my hands as I chew, my teeth scrape against a piece of gristle and I fight back the impulse to vomit. By some miracle, the piece eventually breaks up in my mouth and I am able to swallow.\n\n \n\nI immediately grab the glass of champagne in front of me and drain the glass till it’s empty. I cough and splutter and wipe the back of my mouth with my hand. I stare up at David and Linda, who look neutral, bored even. I can’t even look at Jason. I don’t think I will ever be able to again. The shame of what we have done will sit between us forever. I brace myself for what I know is coming next.\n\n \n\n“Good girl. And now the rest of the plate, please.” David orders.\n\n \n\nIt takes about 45 minutes, I know from staring at the grandfather clock, to finish the small mound of tartare. During the entire time, not a word was spoken between any of us at the table. The only sounds were sounds of chewing, cracking, spluttering and sobbing. Each mouthful brought a new horror, each worse than the last. But the moment finally comes, I look down and through my blurry tears I see the plate is empty apart from a pool of blood in place of where the tartare had sat. *Jane’s blood.*\n\n \n\nI look up with desperate eyes to David and Linda. “I have done what you have asked. Now please, can we leave?”\n\nDavid looks to Linda, and they both burst into menacing laughter. Linda replies, “But if you leave Emily, what will we eat for the main course?”\n\n \n\n**\\~The main course\\~**\n\nBefore I can even process what Linda has said, darkness envelops me. I smell a sour smell – like old, dry sweat. I feel a thick material over my face – a bag. I feel my hands pulled behind my back and my hands tied with rope. I begin to scream, but before I can I am knocked unconscious.\n\n \n\nThe first thing I see when I open my eyes is a bleary vision of white. *Why can I only see white?* My eyes search desperately around, and they make out the top of the dining room window. The white I can see is the ceiling. I am laid on my back.\n\n \n\nI try to move and kick out my legs, but I realise both my legs and arms are tied down to each corner of the dining table.\n\n \n\nThe next thing I register is voices. I recognise the voices of the dinner guests and hosts. But I can hear new voices now. Is it the staff? I strain my head to the side, and see with horror that sat round the table are four men in dinner jackets. They are older men, with greying hair and skin dotted with age spots. They are staring at me. Staring at me like a – *like a piece of meat.*\n\n \n\n“Jason! Where are you? Oh God help me!” I yell at the top of my lungs, wondering if they have kept Jason here or tied him up too. I hear footsteps behind me and see our hosts lined up by the windows with Adam and Jason next to them. I look desperately at Jason, to try and communicate some kind of message, some instructions of how we can escape. Is he playing along, waiting for the right moment to attack David? There are knives in front of the older men, Jason must be waiting for the chance to grab one and save us.\n\n \n\nJason just stares back at me. That look of blank fear on his face again. The room falls silent. All I can hear is my breathing.\n\n \n\nDavid breaks the silence. “Welcome all. I am delighted to present you with the wonderful Emily this evening. Emily – these are gentleman from The Company. They have been very anxious to meet you.”\n\n \n\nMy eyes dart around the table, from my position I am only able to make out the tops of their heads, and notice their eyes looking over my body, laid out on the dining table.\n\n \n\n“As you can see” David continues, “Emily has plenty of fat reserves on her body to feed you all – I know you were worried that she was too slim when you first saw her picture a few months ago.”\n\n \n\n*What?*\n\nMy brain is firing so many things at once I can’t hold a coherent thought. And then it dawns on me. The weight gain. A few months ago, I was a healthy weight until very recently when I had gained more fat than I would like to admit. How did they know that would happen? And how did –\n\n \n\nOh. God.\n\nThe impromptu cupcakes picked up for me from the bakery, the midnight runs to the ice cream shop as a treat, the many nights where a pizza was brought home to save me cooking.\n\nNo. It can’t be.\n\n \n\nI look back at Jason, straining my neck to a painful angle to look at him properly. His blank face slowly looks up at me and gradually his face warps into a smirk. I realise his face wasn’t emotionless from fear earlier, he wasn’t stunned into doing nothing to help me – he was part of it. He has been feeding me up in order to be eaten. Tears flood down my face and into my throat. The pain of straining my neck to hold up my head becomes overwhelming and I drop my shoulders back down, staring up at the ceiling once again.\n\n \n\n“Let me explain from the beginning.” David says. “When your husband and I were young men, we were both into gambling. We had both got so up into our necks with debt that we saw no way out. We owed thousands to loan sharks and criminal gangs. But that’s when we met The Company.”\n\nDavid nods towards the older men sat around the table.\n\n“The Company promised us a way out. They have a taste for certain – delicacies – shall we say? At the time both Jason and I had girlfriends, and were told by The Company to hand over their lives in exchange for enough money to pay off our debts, with enough left over to live comfortably.”\n\n“We were desperate.” Jason added. “We saw no other way out. At the time we presumed our girlfriends would just be killed, not eaten. That was until we were invited to their dinner party. One with a simple rule – you must eat everything on your plate.”\n\n \n\nI gasped, unable to believe what I was hearing. “You sat and ate your fucking girlfriends?” I said incredulously.\n\n \n\n“In order to join The Company and receive it’s benefits, it’s what you must do. If you partake in the crime, you can never report them to the police in fear of your own punishment. And if you decide to leave, you end up as the next meal.” David replies.\n\n \n\n“So why now? Why are you doing this again?” I ask.\n\n \n\n“The Company is a community of likeminded individuals who are very generous.” David gestures around the lavish room, points to the marble floors and to the artwork worth millions adorning the walls. “Very generous indeed.”\n\n \n\n“They offered me £30 million for you, Emily.” Jason interjects. “And besides, once you’re in The Company, you can understand why it’s not easy to get out.” I desperately search his face for any sign of emotion, guilt or hesitation but there is none – no emotion at all.\n\n \n\nSomething dawns on me. “Did you marry me for this purpose? Is this why you proposed so soon after we met?”\n\n It all begins to make sense now. The whirlwind romance, the fact that I had never met Jason’s parents despite our marriage. The fact that he was seemingly so far out of my league. I always wondered why a man like him would be interested in me.\n\n \n\n“It’s just business, Emily. Nothing personal.” Jason says.\n\n \n\n I look to Adam, suddenly remembering his presence and ask, “So you are part of The Company too?”\n\n \n\nAdam nods solemnly. “Yes. I was drunk driving, hit and killed a pedestrian. I was sure to go to prison for a long time. The Company found me and told me that in exchange for Jane the case would be dropped.” Adam hangs his head in shame, “I didn’t know about the dinner party aspect until tonight.”\n\n \n\nFinally, I look to meet the gaze of Linda. “And you.” I spit out. “How can you be involved in this?”\n\n \n\nLinda looks lovingly to her husband. “We made an agreement when we married. I would permit my husband to make his millions however he saw fit, and in exchange I enjoy a life of luxury and relaxation. It’s a small price to pay to host the occasional dinner party.” She sneers.\n\n \n\nI try to think of more questions, to continue delaying the inevitable. Maybe I can kill enough time for help to arrive. But I realise there is no way out of this. Everyone in this house is involved with The Company. The hosts, the staff – even my own goddamn husband.\n\n \n\nDavid leads his wife, along with Adam and Jason, out of the room. He motions to the men seated at the table to begin their feast. “I’m terribly sorry Emily, it was nice to meet you though.” With a sick smile he leaves the room and shuts the double doors.\n\n \n\nImmediately, I feel a hand grab my ankle. I scream and try to kick out, unable to move from the rope tying me to the table. I hear the sound of a large knife being pulled out from a set, the sound of sharp metal soaring through the air. And then comes the pain. The pain of a blade sinking into my leg, just above the knee. The sawing motion. The feeling of nerve strings being severed, one by one. The dull crack as my femur is splintered.\n\n \n\nThe sound of chewing. The sound of lips smacking. Crunching noises as teeth clamp over bone and gristle. Small sounds of delight.\n\n \n\nAnd then – no sounds at all, as the last of my vision blurs and my consciousness fades into black.\n\nMy first story - hope someone enjoys!"},"907":{"title":"The Collector’s Curse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ew59et\/the_collectors_curse\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"[deleted]","selftext":"I never believed in curses—until the day I found the box.\n\nIt was a rainy Thursday afternoon when I stumbled upon it. I was exploring the basement of my recently inherited family home. My great-uncle had been a notorious recluse, and his house had remained untouched for years. Among the dusty relics and cobweb-covered furniture, I found a wooden box. It was ornate, with intricate carvings of faces twisted in agony. The box was locked, but a brass key was attached to it with a faded red ribbon.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me. I unlocked the box and found it filled with old photographs and small, peculiar trinkets. Each photograph was of a different person, all appearing terrified or distressed. The trinkets were bizarre—miniature dolls, twisted metal objects, and pieces of fabric with strange symbols embroidered on them. There was also a leather-bound journal at the bottom of the box.\n\nThe journal was filled with entries from someone named Edgar Wren, dated over a century ago. The entries described Wren’s obsession with collecting “souls” and “moments of fear.” He believed that capturing genuine terror in physical objects allowed him to harness and control it. The last entry detailed an experiment gone wrong and warned that the “collector’s curse” would be unleashed if the box was ever opened.\n\nI dismissed it as the ramblings of a madman—until things started happening.\n\nThe first night, I heard scratching sounds coming from the basement. I ignored them, thinking it was just old pipes settling. But the sounds grew louder each night, and a chill seemed to permeate the entire house. Shadows flickered unnaturally, and I started having nightmares of the faces in the photographs, their eyes following me wherever I went.\n\nA week after finding the box, I began to notice strange changes. The air in the house grew colder, and I felt a constant sense of being watched. Objects started moving on their own—books falling off shelves, doors creaking open, and lights flickering. I tried to dismiss it as stress-induced paranoia, but one night, I saw something I can’t explain.\n\nI was in bed when I heard a soft, whispering voice. It was coming from the hallway, but when I got up to check, no one was there. As I turned to go back to bed, I saw it—a shadowy figure standing at the end of the hallway. Its face was a shifting blur, like it was struggling to maintain a solid form. The figure’s presence was suffocating, and it seemed to be feeding off my fear.\n\nI raced downstairs and saw that the box was no longer in the basement. It was on the dining table, the lid slightly ajar. Panic surged through me as I approached it, and that’s when I noticed something horrifying—the trinkets and photographs were changing. The faces in the photos were now screaming in silent agony, and the trinkets seemed to writhe and twist as if alive.\n\nIn the journal, Edgar Wren described a way to break the curse: one must return the items to their rightful owners and face the fear they caused. But with each passing day, the shadowy figure grew stronger and more aggressive. It seemed to be trying to force me to confront my deepest fears.\n\nDesperate, I began researching the people in the photographs. One by one, I tracked down their descendants and returned the items. Each return seemed to temporarily weaken the figure, but it always came back stronger. I realized that I was running out of time and options.\n\nThe final entry in the journal mentioned that the curse could only be broken by confronting the source of the fear head-on. I had no idea what that meant, but I was willing to try anything.\n\nI returned to the basement one last time. I found myself face-to-face with the shadowy figure again. The air was thick with dread, and the figure’s presence was overwhelming. I closed my eyes, trying to focus on the journal’s final entry. I had to confront my own fears, whatever that meant.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a sharp pain and heard a loud crack. When I opened my eyes, I was back in my bedroom, drenched in sweat. The box was gone, and the house was eerily silent. I don’t know if I truly broke the curse or if it’s just waiting for me to slip up again.\n\nI moved out of the house the next day and never looked back. I still have nightmares about that shadowy figure, and sometimes, I feel a cold presence watching me. I hope the curse is truly gone, but I can’t shake the feeling that the collector’s curse is still out there, waiting for its next victim.\n\nIf you ever come across an old, ornate box with twisted carvings and a lock, don’t open it. Some curses are better left undisturbed."},"908":{"title":"Saltwater Ghosts of New England Beach","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ew4lqt\/saltwater_ghosts_of_new_england_beach\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Discover the chilling tales of a haunted New England beach!

I had to call every apartment and invite the residents to a meeting that was to be held on the first floor. As always, some promised to come, some declined, some peeked through the peephole and didn’t open the door. Soon, I reached the second or third floor—I don’t remember exactly—and rang the bell of apartment No. 57. From behind the shabby wooden door, I heard a voice: \"Who are you?\" I cheerfully and loudly began to explain that there would be a meeting in the entrance hall, that I was a representative of the best company, and all the other nonsense. The same voice asked again: \"Who are you?\" (I couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman, but it was clear that I was talking to an old, senile person). I was a bit confused but introduced myself again—John, the company's manager. After the third \"Who are you?\" I realized it was useless to talk and moved on, but that cursed door kept shouting the question louder and angrier. As the noise on the landing grew, I went downstairs to the first floor...Stay tuned for the continuation of this chilling story on my channel (**@Mr.DarkGloom **)**"},"913":{"title":"The bank I work at got robbed today, The people who robbed us were never found..

The place has a history as old as the town itself, with stories of a botched robbery decades ago that left many dead. Most of us thought those were just ghost stories to spook new hires. After what happened last Friday, though, I’m not so sure anymore.\n\nIt started like any other day. We were close to closing time when I noticed a group of five men loitering outside. They looked out of place, and a chill ran down my spine. I brushed it off and went back to my work, but that feeling of unease wouldn’t go away.\n\nThen they came in, guns drawn, yelling for everyone to get down. Customers screamed, and I dropped behind the counter, my heart pounding. Julie and Tom, my colleagues, were frozen with fear, and Mr. Clarkson, our manager, looked like he was about to have a heart attack.\n\n“Everyone down! Now!” shouted the leader, a tall man with a deep voice.\n\nTom stumbled to his feet, trying to open the vault, his hands shaking so badly he could barely work the keypad. The robbers spread out, one heading towards Mr. Clarkson’s office, another towards the lobby, keeping an eye on us.\n\nJust as Tom managed to get the vault open, the lights flickered and went out completely. Panic erupted in the darkness. I fumbled for my phone to use as a light, but before I could, a scream pierced the air.\n\nWhen the lights came back on, one of the robbers was on the floor, his throat slashed open, blood pooling around his body. The others stared in shock, their guns swinging wildly.\n\n“What the hell happened?” the leader demanded, his voice tinged with fear.\n\nNone of us had an answer. The air felt thick and oppressive, every shadow seemed to move with a life of its own.\n\n“Get back to work!” the leader snapped at his men, trying to regain control. “We’re getting out of here.”\n\nThe lights flickered again, plunging us into darkness. Another scream echoed through the bank. The lights came back on, and another robber was gone. Not dead. Just gone.\n\nThe remaining three robbers were visibly shaken. The leader tried to keep his composure, but I could see the fear in his eyes. He barked orders, trying to hurry his men along, but the atmosphere had changed. The old bank felt like it was closing in on us.\n\nThe power went out again, and this time, I felt a cold hand brush against my arm in the darkness. I bit back a scream, using my phone to cast a weak light. The shadows seemed to twist and writhe, and I caught glimpses of movement, shapes that shouldn’t be there.\n\nThe lights flickered back on, and the leader’s right-hand man was sprawled on the floor, his face twisted in terror, his body riddled with what looked like claw marks. The leader swore loudly, backing away from the scene, his gun shaking in his hand.\n\n“Enough!” he shouted. “We’re leaving. Now!”\n\nBut the power had other ideas. The lights went out again, plunging us into darkness. This time, I heard a low, guttural growl, something primal and ancient. The remaining robbers screamed, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of fear.\n\nWhen the lights flickered back on, only the leader was left. He stood in the middle of the room, his eyes wild, his gun hanging limply at his side. He turned slowly, looking at each of us, his face pale and haunted.\n\n“What…what is this place?” he whispered, more to himself than to anyone else.\n\nBefore anyone could answer, the power went out again. This time, the darkness was absolute, suffocating. I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear the leader’s ragged breathing, his panicked footsteps as he stumbled around the room.\n\nAnd then, silence.\n\nWhen the lights flickered back on, the leader was gone. The bank was eerily quiet, the only sounds the faint hum of the machinery and the soft sobs of the customers. Julie and Tom were huddled together, their faces pale and drawn.\n\nI stood up slowly, my legs shaking, and made my way to the front door. It was locked from the outside, but the robbers had left their tools behind. I fumbled with the lock, finally managing to get the door open.\n\nThe police arrived moments later, flooding the bank with their flashing lights and barking orders. They found the bodies of the robbers, but no sign of the leader or the other two. The investigators were baffled, their faces grim as they tried to piece together what had happened.\n\nI gave my statement, but I left out the details about the power outages and the shadows. I knew they wouldn’t believe me. Hell, I barely believed it myself.\n\nThe bank was closed for a week while they conducted their investigation. When we finally reopened, the atmosphere was different. The old building felt even more oppressive, the shadows darker, the air heavier. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that something was lurking just out of sight.\n\nOne evening, as I was closing up, Julie approached me. She looked just as haggard as I felt, dark circles under her eyes and a haunted look on her face.\n\n“Dan, we need to talk,” she said, her voice trembling.\n\nI nodded, leading her to the break room where we could have some privacy. She closed the door behind us and took a deep breath.\n\n“I can’t take it anymore,” she said, her voice breaking. “The nightmares, the feeling that something is watching us…I don’t think it’s just in our heads.”\n\nI swallowed hard, my throat dry. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I did some research,” she continued, her hands shaking. “There was a robbery here, decades ago. But it wasn’t just a robbery. It was a massacre. The robbers killed everyone in the bank, including themselves. They say the place is haunted by their spirits, trapped here, seeking revenge.”\n\nI felt a cold chill run down my spine. “And you think what happened last Friday…?”\n\n“It was them,” she said, her eyes wide with fear. “I’m sure of it. The spirits of those who died in that massacre. They’re still here, and they’re protecting this place.”\n\nI wanted to dismiss her words as nonsense, but deep down, I knew she was right. The events of that night, the unexplainable deaths of the robbers, the oppressive atmosphere…it all pointed to something supernatural.\n\n“We need to do something,” Julie said, her voice desperate. “We need to find a way to put the spirits to rest.”\n\nI nodded, though I had no idea how we could possibly do that. “We’ll figure it out,” I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt.\n\nThat night, I went home and did my own research. I found articles about the robbery, detailing the gruesome deaths and the rumors of hauntings that followed. I read about similar cases, other places where violent events had left behind restless spirits. The more I read, the more convinced I became that Julie was right.\n\nThe next day at work, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched. Every shadow seemed to move, every noise seemed amplified. The customers came and went, oblivious to the terror that lurked within the old building.\n\nAfter closing, Julie, Tom, and I stayed behind to discuss what we could do. We talked about bringing in a priest or a medium, someone who could help us deal with the spirits. But finding someone who believed in this sort of thing and was willing to help wasn’t going to be easy.\n\nAs we were talking, the power went out again. We all froze, the memories of that night flooding back. The emergency lights flickered on, casting an eerie glow over the room.\n\n“We need to get out of here,” Tom said, his voice shaking.\n\nBefore we could move, the temperature in the room dropped, and we could see our breath misting in the cold air. A low, guttural growl echoed through the bank, and the shadows seemed to shift and twist.\n\n“We’re not alone,” Julie whispered, her eyes wide with terror.\n\nA figure emerged from the shadows, its form twisted and grotesque. It was one of the robbers, his face contorted in a mask of rage and pain. He moved towards us, his eyes burning with hatred.\n\n“Run!” I shouted, grabbing Julie’s hand and pulling her towards the door.\n\nWe stumbled through the darkness, the figure close behind us. The old building seemed to close in on us, the walls narrowing, the shadows pressing in. We reached the front door, but it wouldn’t budge. It was as if the building itself was conspiring to keep us trapped.\n\n“Help!” Tom shouted, pounding on the door.\n\nThe figure reached out, its cold, dead hands brushing against my back. I turned, swinging my flashlight wildly, but it passed right through him. The spirit let out a howl of rage, and I felt a searing pain in my chest.\n\n“Keep moving!” I shouted, pushing Julie and Tom towards the back door.\n\nWe ran through the labyrinthine halls of the bank, the figure close behind. The building seemed to twist and change around us, the shadows growing darker, the air growing colder. We reached the back door, and with a final, desperate effort, we managed to break it open.\n\nWe stumbled outside, gasping for breath, the cold night air a welcome relief. The figure stopped at the threshold, its eyes burning with hatred as it watched us.\n\n“We need to find help,” Julie said, her voice shaking.\n\nI nodded, though I wasn’t sure who we could turn to. The police wouldn’t believe us . A priest or a medium seemed like the only options. But as I looked back at the old bank, something shifted in my mind.\n\n“Wait,” I said, stopping Julie and Tom. “What if…what if we don’t try to get rid of them?”\n\nTom frowned. “What do you mean?”\n\n“What if we use them?” I suggested, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me. “What if we let the spirits protect the bank from future robberies?”\n\nJulie’s eyes widened in realization. “You mean, let them stay? Use their hatred to keep others out?”\n\nI nodded. “It’s not ideal, but it’s clear they don’t want anyone stealing from here again. If we can make peace with them, maybe we can coexist.”\n\nTom looked uncertain, but Julie slowly nodded. “It might work. We just need to find a way to communicate with them, make sure they understand we’re not the enemy.”\n\nWe spent the next few days researching how to communicate with spirits. We found an old book in the local library that suggested using objects from the time of the haunting to establish a connection. We gathered some old coins and papers from the bank’s archives and set up a small shrine in the break room.\n\nThat night, we stayed late again, the building silent and foreboding. We arranged the items on the shrine and lit a candle, sitting in a circle around it.\n\n“We come in peace,” I said, my voice trembling slightly. “We know what happened here, and we understand your pain. We don’t want to drive you away. We want to make a deal.”\n\nThe air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to gather around us. A low whisper echoed through the room, and I felt a presence brush against my mind.\n\n“We will let you stay,” Julie said, her voice steady. “We won’t disturb you, and we’ll make sure the bank stays as it is. All we ask is that you protect this place from those who mean harm.”\n\nThe whisper grew louder, a multitude of voices overlapping. I couldn’t understand the words, but the tone was clear: anger, pain, a deep sense of betrayal. But then, slowly, it shifted to something else. Acceptance.\n\nThe candle flickered, and the shadows seemed to retreat slightly. The temperature in the room rose, and the oppressive feeling lifted just a bit.\n\n“They agree,” Tom whispered, his eyes wide with awe. “They’ll stay, and they’ll protect the bank.”\n\nOver the next few weeks, we noticed a change in the atmosphere. The bank still felt old and haunted, but the oppressive weight had lifted. Customers came and went, unaware of the spirits watching over them. And we, the workers, learned to coexist with the ghosts of the past.\n\nWe never had another robbery. The spirits made sure of that. The few times someone tried, they were met with the same fate as the robbers from that fateful night. The police eventually stopped investigating, writing off the incidents as accidents or disappearances.\n\nWe never spoke of it outside our circle. The bank continued to operate, a silent guardian watching over us. And while the shadows still danced and the air still grew cold, we knew we were safe. The spirits of Silverlake Savings had found a new purpose, and in their eternal vigil, they protected us all."},"914":{"title":"Henry Ran a Radio Station After Dark From an Old Abandoned Nunnery","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evni87\/henry_ran_a_radio_station_after_dark_from_an_old\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"1000andonenites","selftext":"Henry poured boiling water into his grimy coffee mug, and inhaled the aroma of instant coffee. With a sigh of pleasure, he sat, adjusted his comically huge headphones and started flicking the various switches before him. He leaned into the microphone.  \n\n“Welcome, welcome all you night owls to our not-so-abandoned nunnery. I’m Henry, with a most excellently dark program ready for your listening pleasure. And together with Sister Mindy, we will accompany you into the wee hours of the morning-” \n\nA rustle in the shadows slightly interrupted him, enough to make him pause, but not to stop his smooth mellow broadcast of words. Her real name obviously wasn’t Mindy, and she made her displeasure at this whole set-up known in various small ways- none of which actually deterred him.  \n\n“I decided to start with a real golden one, put us in the mood for the night ahead. You can’t go wrong with Zep, and so let’s start climbing those *Stairways to Heaven*.”  \n\nHenry flicked more switches, and then leaned back and sipped on the black hot fluid.  \n\n“You like Led Zep, Mindy?” he called into the shadows. He had never figured out if she could hear the sublime music.  \n\nHe was answered with an unfamiliar noise. He frowned- it wasn’t like her usual sighings.  \n\nIt seemed to come from outside the nunnery.  \n\nBut there was no time to wonder. As the last beats of the song faded, he turned on the switches. “Well folks, hope none of you will be climbing those stairs for a long while yet, eh! Unlike our poor Sister who climbed them many many years ago. We’re heading into listeners’ requests, but in case you’re one of those heathens who fall asleep to the great Zep, here’s something to wake you up and make you grab that phone to call us.”  \n\nHe started *Jump!* The rustle behind him seemed to swell on each call of “jump” and Henry was becoming convinced that she could indeed listen. \n\nThe light for the phone line flickered. Always a keener who called too soon. Never mind- he'd record it and play it back if it was good. He flicked the switch “Hello?” \n\n“Henry- Sister Mindy- help-” gasped the caller.  \n\nUgh. Almost every night some weirdo would call in. Usually he just hung up, but he decided to play along. “You want *Help*? A Beatles solid!”   \n\n“No-” gasped the caller. “It’s happening- no-” the line sizzled, that outside noise, and the line went dead.  \n\n“Hello?” called Henry. Stupid asshole – waste of space. *Jump!* was coming to an end. He was live.  \n\nSister Mindy gasped. Henry snapped around “What?”  \n\nThe blinds glowed, and the space lit up. For a second, and for the first time, Henry saw Sister Mindy’s outline.  \n\nThen everything went dark.  \n\nThe open line remained silent. Henry frowned- despite the late hours, they usually had a steady flow of callers.  \n\nHenry drained his coffee. Then he got up, and stepped outside.  \n\nOne by one, the stars were going out.  \n\n "},"915":{"title":"Moon Mad: Part One","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evm1zd\/moon_mad_part_one\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Mysterious-Ad-4795","selftext":"Moon Mad\nby \nB.P.K.\n\n\tThey stood in the harvested cornfield, their hands moving up and down each other’s bodies. Young and in love or what passed as love between two young adults in the final year of their high school careers. Suzy Fallon, already eighteen, was ready to leave her small town behind and join a sorority at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. And Kirk Wendle, a baseball all-star with a 96-mile-per-hour fastball and strong ambitions of pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies. They both wore promise rings on their right hands. Some jerks at school found it corny or lame, but it was a buoyant symbol of marriage to them. The idea of it conveniently omitted real-world consequences, but they still had plenty of time to navigate the battleground of long-term commitment. At least, they thought they did. \n\t“I love you,” Kirk said, his voice a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. \n\t“I love you, too,” Suzy replied, her brown hair blowing in the crisp autumn air.\n            Overhead, the moon was full and tinted the color of fire. A moon this color was a magnificent cosmic sign that favored the sowing of wild oats. For one night, folks were asked by the stars to look up, hit pause on their overloaded worlds of algorithms and smartphone doom-scrolling, and remember what it felt like to fall in love for the first time.\n“Are you one hundred percent sure?” Kurt asked, his blue eyes searching her large brown eyes, trying to decode if tonight would be the night.  \n“I’m not,” Suzy replied.   \nKurt’s shoulders slumped, and his body felt one hundred pounds heavier. Suzy’s skin appeared paler than it had earlier in the day. He reckoned her vampire complexion was a side effect of having a date in the middle of a furrowed cornfield in early November. The cornfield date should have been a home run, but Kirk could feel that his nuts were closer to his stomach than his scrotum. Tonight wasn’t a home run; it was a strike-three looking. The final out. Game over. \n“It’s all the bullshit on social media about the serial killer, isn’t it?” he asked. \nSuzy took a step back and gently pushed Kirk’s hands away. The once invigorating breeze felt bitter. She identified a wind that causes arthritic bones to feel postmortem. A cruel reminder that death’s process isn't immediate; it’s a slow walk through the thickest mud, and the prize at the end is a heartless bird that sings out of key, “Nevermore. Nevermore.” A chill ran down Suzy’s spine. \n“It’s definitely not helping,” she said. “The last person they found was in Whitman’s Mill. And it’s a full moon.”\nKirk ruffled his blond hair, doing his best to keep from spewing out any expression that could sink the night into loveless silence. He gazed back at his truck, a Dodge Ram he bought with the money he saved from working summers and weekends at his father’s auto repair shop WE MET BY ACCIDENT off Old Piper Road. \n“Whitman’s Mill is ten miles away,” Kirk said.\n“He–”\n“It could be a she, Suzy. Maybe. Fuck if I know.” \n            Suzy was ready to roll her eyes but caught herself and said, “Serial killers are overwhelmingly guys. White guys, if we’re talking Google facts.”\nKirk was blindsided, left utterly speechless that a serial killer who was working out their demons by recording their murders on microcassette tapes and mailing those tapes to local radio stations had cock blocked him. He wanted to punch a wall. He wanted to punch the moon until it bled gray from its dusty lunar surface. \nFrom behind the Ram, a branch snapped in the woods. The shrill vaulted over the couple. Suzy and Kirk locked eyes. Each thought the same thing. The Killer’s in Harveston. Potentially. Should we run to the truck? \nThe local radio stations and newspapers had stamped the psychopath as the FM Killer. Only once was a complete recording played on the air. It lasted one minute and six seconds on 99.9 KIZZ. \nKirk was working on the Ram in the garage when the disc jockey warned the audience in a deep and robotic voice, “What you are about to hear is graphic and very disturbing.”\nHe stopped toying with the Ram’s spark plugs and listened closely. There were screams, high-pitched, ear-splitting, fucking relentless. There were also inexplicable grunts that sounded like dog barks or growls, as if some eye-toothed animal was present, yelling orders to the killer like a boxing coach from the corner of the ring.  \nThe sounds from the woods caused the hair on the back of Suzy’s neck to stand. Kirk didn’t want to show he was scared, but he was. With his heart thumping, Kirk drew his iPhone, pressed on the light, and aimed it toward the noise.  \n“What the hell was that?” Suzy asked.\n“I don’t know,” Kirk said. “There’s all kinds of creatures in these woods.” \nSuzy grabbed his hand. He looked down, and in the glow of the phone’s beam, he could see her ghost-white knuckles. She had saddled up to him. It was the closest she’d been to him since the FM Killer was brought up. Kirk, ever the optimist, believed this cocktail of love and terror had potential. “Adapt or die, Captain Kirk,” his father would say when life threw him a curveball. He accepted that lovemaking under the moon was officially off the table. \n“We could take our little party somewhere else,” Kirk said. \n“Where?” \n“A place where we can lock the fucking door.”\nSuzy gazed into his eyes, sensing a blue mood in Kirk. She touched his chest and felt his heart pounding away like a jackhammer. She decided that this was an unhealthy situation that required quick remediation. \n“Do we have more beer?” \n“Yeah,” Kirk said. “Busch was on sale.”\n“How about a hotel room?” Suzy asked. \nKirk’s eyes widened, and the dread inside him shrank. He knew where to go: the rinky-dink motel off Route 422. In the blistering heat of late July, the motel’s owner, Old Joe Ott, brought his 2004 Pontiac in for an oil change, and Kirk gave him a friendly discount on the service. He hoped Old Joe would remember him, more importantly, the dough he saved him, and give Kirk a free room. \nSuzy clicked her seat belt inside the Ram, smiled at Kirk, and said, “No more talk about serial killers, okay?” \nKirk nodded, starting the Ram and flipping on the lights. In the truck’s bed, the case of Busch rested on top of some folded blankets. Neither Suzy nor Kirk saw the case of beer stir as the Ram’s squawking suspension bungled its way out of the cornfield and turned onto the lightless backroad.  \n\nJamie McCauley saw the sirens on the drive home from school. Dozens of cops were parked outside Saint Benedict’s on Main Street. There were so many lights, the cruisers’ raspberries whooping and twirling about. Jamie estimated that every badge on the force was on the scene. She had never seen so many cops in one place, only in movies or on the 24\/7 news when a school or shopping mall became a shooting range. \nJamie parked outside the CVS and browsed social media on her phone. She found only scarce information: a body had been discovered behind the church, but the sheriff’s department Tweet said nothing about the victim’s identity. Overhyped brain cells led Jamie to think the FM Killer had expanded their zone of violence. She stared at the large cup of Starbucks coffee in the cup holder, her hands jittery. She powered down the window and dumped the dark brown liquid out.  \nHours later, Jamie sat at her desk in her bedroom. She was writing a thesis for her application to an AI design and security summer program at Temple University on her laptop. She was typing the essay's last paragraph, ready to put the cherry on top of the sundae, and then what can only be described as a sixth sense electrified her nervous system. An irritating hotness claimed her face. \n Taking her hands off the keyboard, Jamie stared at the laptop’s screen, baffled but determined to excavate the cause of these abrasive feelings—both mental and physical. \nOutside, Jamie heard the family dog barking: Willy Wonka, their twelve-year-old lab. He was fat and blind as a bat but made up for his lack of sight with his supersonic hearing and beefy vocals. Three stentorian woofs rang out. Then two. Seconds passed. Silence. \nJamie left her desk and locked the bedroom door. She moved to the bed, gazed at her mint-colored iPhone, and picked it up. She opened the last text message swap between Suzy and herself. \nJamie: Be careful tonight. \nSuzy: All good. Kirk has protection. \nJamie: GTK. But not what I meant. FYI: you get knocked up and he will sooo cut and run. If Taylor Swift ever needs new material send Kirk her way. JK.\nSuzy: Ha! If I get knocked up the only thing getting cut outta my life will be the baby. \nJamie: You do you. I was talking about the F\/M Killer. They found two bodies in Whit’s Mill. Fucking nuts.\nSuzy: Crazy is gonna crazy. Kirk’s been planning this night for a while. I can’t bail on him… and I don’t wanna go to college a virgin. \nJamie: I get it. Kinda. Promise me one thing. \nSuzy: What? \nJamie: Carry bear spray, please. \nSuzy: I promise. \nJamie: TY. Hugs. :) \nThe two girls, now young women, had been best friends since the third grade. They knew each other’s most personal secrets, and Suzy was Jamie’s shoulder to cry on through two of her mother’s divorces. There was no way their last communication was going to be an emoji. Jamie opened her contacts and called Suzy. \nSuzy answered the phone and turned down the radio. Kirk puffed on his vape, filling the cabin with a tropical fruit aroma. Suzy waved at the smoke and gave her attention to Jamie. \n“What’s up,” Suzy said. \nShe could hear Jamie’s breathing. It sounded stressed, like she had recently returned from the gym. There was a problem with that string of thought because Jamie hated exercising.  \nKirk checked his phone’s GPS. The motel was two minutes away. He glanced over at Suzy and asked, “Who is it?”\n“Jamie,” Suzy answered. \nKirk’s facial muscles tightened, and he took a cranky drag off his vape. He and Jamie rarely saw eye to eye on anything. Kirk’s passion for deer hunting was the most significant wedge between them. It also didn’t help that the night they all smoked weed in Suzy’s basement—the potent sinsemilla disabling the filter between Kirk’s brain and his mouth—he claimed that Jamie was a prude (with the additional subtext she might be a lesbian who refuses to admit it to herself). That was the last time the trio smoked anything together. \n“No, he didn’t ditch me,” Suzy said as Kirk clutched the wheel tighter, wringing his hands over the wheel. \n“Cool. I guess,” Jamie said. “Hey, I have some breaking news for you.”\n“Justin Bieber ODed?”\n“What? No. Bieber is fine,” Jamie said. “They found a body behind Saint Benedict’s. The cops are being all hush-hush about it. I think it’s the F.M. Killer.” \nJamie let the word killer hang in the air. She wanted to torpedo home the point that something truly evil could be walking or driving around the streets of Harveston.\n“She’s mine tonight, Jamie,” Kirk yelled. “You’re just gonna have to wait your turn!”\nSuzy frowned at Kirk. He shrugged his shoulders and went back to sucking on his vape. \n“You were right. He is an asshole,” Suzy said, peering out the window and into the passing abyss. \nThe Ram came to a red light and stopped. If there was a blood-lusting lunatic out in the wild, the night provided the perfect cover. \n“Better to find out now than to find out later,” Jamie said. “If I didn’t call knowing a serial killer might be in Harveston, and you guys being at the cornfield and all… I wouldn’t have been able to sleep tonight.” \n“And that’s why I love you,” Suzy said. “You worry more about me than my own parents.” \nSuzy saw the sign for SIMPLE JOE’S MOTEL. Its dim neon glow was a beacon of security. Then she read the crooked letters posted on the motel’s sign: FREE PORN RENTALS… ALL U CAN WATCH… \n“Text or call me when you get home,” Jamie said. \n“I will. Kirk’s driving me home right now.”\nKirk glanced at Suzy, his countenance resembling a meme with WTF written across it. Suzy shook her head, no, and Kirk’s witless expression vanished. He flicked on the turn signal and cut the wheel. \n“Remember, my mom’s going shopping for wedding dresses tomorrow,” Jamie said. “She wants your opinion. It’s so cringey. My third Dad will literally be named Chad. Tell a friend to tell a friend that my life’s a sick joke.” \n“Fuck, Chad,” Suzy said. “He’s your mom’s headache, not yours. Don’t let him be a main character in your life. You got way better things on the horizon.” \nKirk pulled into Simple Joe's Motel's lonely and dark parking lot. Scouting, the only other car he saw was a white-ish Pontiac. The beater was caked in dirt, and the front left tire wasn't a tire at all; it was the donut. The car was laughably lopsided on the sham tire, and Kirk wondered if Old Joe knew the emergency rubber was only good for fifty miles. Harveston was small compared to Allentown or Hershey but wasn’t exactly walkable. \nKirk exited the Ram, shut his door, and curiously roamed toward the Pontiac, leaving Suzy to wrap up her call with Jamie. \n“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Jamie said. \nSuzy already had her hand on the door handle and asked, “What time?”\n“Her and Chad are at the bar getting wasted,” Jamie said. “She’ll be a mid-functioning human around threeish.” \nSuzy laughed and told Jamie to have a good night. She also thanked her for checking in and confirmed that Kirk did have asshole-ish moments. But Suzy lied when she told Jamie that Kirk had pulled into her driveway and she was going to get some shuteye. \nAt peace, Jamie clicked off the call and stared at her reflection in the mirror above her desk. She targeted the bags under her eyes, looking like half-moons. Jamie hadn't been sleeping well. And she called it a win if she managed four hours of REM sleep. But when did my sleep go to shit? \nJamie’s heart skipped a beat. It was when she listened to one of the FM Killer’s alleged murders on Reddit. Her Sony headphones were on, and the wet, gruesome noises poisoned her ears. \nShe paused the clip and scrolled down the page to read the community comments. Jamie shut the lid of her laptop because, for her, time had stopped. Then, it pushed ahead in tessellated cinematic slow motion, her eyes stuck on the word werewolf. \n\nThe couple opened the door, and it moaned like a wounded walrus bleeding on a craggy rock. Suzy stared at the number on the door… 13… lucky me, she thought. They moved along and were met with a wall of revolting smells. Stale cigarettes, spilled booze, and ancient body odor. Suzy guessed the brown shag carpeting was from the early seventies, and the cinereous colored gum stomped into it was from all the decades since. \nKirk motioned to Suzy with a gentlemanly wave of his hand: after you, my lady. Suzy cautiously entered. The boxed TV had bent rabbit ears, a framed picture of Ronald Reagan above it, and the umber-colored sheets on the king bed looked like they were made from crispy locust skin.\n Suzy faced Kirk and said, “I’m not letting anything on that bed touch my body.” \nOld Joe, shoveling a spoonful of Lucky Charms into his mouth, looked out the window from inside his cramped office and saw Kirk grab something out of the Ram’s truck bed. Milk dribbled down his chin, but Old Joe didn't give a flying fuck. He had lost his beloved wife three years ago to Covid. Her whole life, she had labored with chronic asthma. Still, it was an unfathomable fate. A devilish germ traveled 7,228 miles from Wuhan, China, to Harveston, PA, and bound its proteins to his wife’s, leaving Old Joe a widower sooner than he planned. \nTwo brassy dings rang out from the front room. It was the service bell on the welcome desk. Old Joe sighed, placed the cereal bowl atop a filing cabinet, and shuffled out.  \nOld Joe peeled back the curtain that led to the welcome desk. A tall and sturdy man with long raven hair stood. He wore a rickety houndstooth blazer and had bright yellow eyes. Upon closer examination, Old Joe realized they were contact lenses because he could see the shadowy cellophane line that circled the man’s iris. But the man had a vibe, and Old Joe radared it. It was disturbing, evasive. Old Joe had his own category for it… the heebie jeebies.\n“Help you, sir?” Old Joe asked.  \nSilence. The man didn’t answer him. He just looked straight ahead. Old Joe was in no mood for games and said, “You missed Halloween, pal. You gettin’ a room or what?” \nThe man’s lips stayed shut. He extended his hand, and Old Joe eyed the long fingernails. The points were sharp and curved inward, sculpted to resemble a beast’s claw. Were they glued on? The longest nail, the pointer, had bits of crimson on it. \nAgain, the man evenly jabbed the service bell twice. Old Joe was stumped by the man’s oddball behavior. He went to talk but was cut off when the man started to purr. What began as a whisper increased in volume until the man was snarling wildly. \nOld Joe thought about the kids in Room 13 because this customer was proving to be more than a nuisance. Old Joe, his stomach in his throat, stepped back and watched as white froth bubbled from the corners of the man’s mouth. \nA microcassette recorder materialized on the desk. The record button already pushed in. Old Joe was taken by the nostalgia of the machine, watching the supply and take-up reels spin behind the clear shield of the dust protector. He was hypnotized by it. \nGripped in the right hand of the rabid man was a loaded dart gun. Old Joe’s eyes filled with pulsing terror. The trigger clicked. It was a close-range blast, and Old Joe could feel the air poof off the gun. The projectile lodged itself in Old Joe’s larynx, and he felt the tips of his fingers go numb before he fell over. He was paralyzed from the neck down, and all he could hear was the man in the houndstooth blazer breathing huskily above him. \nThe long-haired man opened his blazer and returned the dart gun to its holster. He slunk to the entrance door, locked it, and turned off the lights. Old Joe screamed and screamed, much to the deranged delight of the man and his microcassette recorder. \n\nOld Joe would be found three days later by Officer Archetti on a wellness check at the request of his daughter, Josephine Ott. Pictures taken by a forensic photographer on loan from Philadelphia were unlike anything ever encountered in Harveston. \nOld Joe was photographed in his underwear with his intestines wrapped around his neck, his ears and lips chewed off and stuffed into his nostrils. His tongue had also been ripped out, and bite marks were present in the bloated lump of tissue lying on the service bell. Likewise, the tips of his fingers were gnawed down to the bone. And when lifted up to be carried to the coroner’s van, the skin of Old Joe’s back split down the middle like a zipper, sending sludgy organs to the floor with a splat.  \nTwo hours later, Harveston P.D. busted down the door to Room 13, and multiple breakfasts—primarily bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwiches—were returned to the pavement by their gold-badged eaters. The brutality and gore between (and on) the walls of Room 13 were ad infinitum nastier than what was documented behind the check-in desk. Kirk and Suzy would require closed caskets, and the only way their parents could positively identify them for the death certificates was through DNA testing.\n"},"916":{"title":"Peter isn't talking to himself, but he is just breaking the 4th wall","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evio8y\/peter_isnt_talking_to_himself_but_he_is_just\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"Peter doesn't talk to himself but he is just breaking the 4th wall. He talks to some audience which is invisible to the rest of the world. Also to the rest of us, Peter also looks like he is just talking to himself. He could be talking with us and then in an instant, he would look away at something and he would say something completely random. This has caused many people to have arguments with Peter. Like at Kennys birthday, Kenny was having a big meal and then Peter looked away at something and he muttered \"Kenny is a fat cunt but it's his birthday\" and this made Kenny angry. \n\nPeter has broken up many friendships because of breaking the 4th wall. Even when it was just me and Peter at a food place eating something. We would both be talking and then randomly Peter would look away at something and he would say \"James has a lousy life doesn't he\" and I would hear it very clearly that he was talking about me right infront of me. Now I just kind of ignore it and let Peter break the 4th wall, but everyone wonders about who the main characters are in this reality. Then one day at a gathering, we all asked Peter about who the main character was? \n\nPeter told us that the main character was little old Elizabeth and everyone was jealous, angry and confused all at the same time. Then Peter looked away to break the 4th wall and he put us all down. Then Peter told us that if Elizabeth died then the main character will change. Whenever Peter breaks the 4th wall and looks away, he is always slagging somebody off to whatever audience he is talking to. Then when little old Elizabeth died, nobody cared about her death but rather who would be the next main character. \n\nPeter said that the main character was now boring Ian. Ian couldn't believe it and neither could anyone else. Peter looked away to break the 4th wall and he said something to whoever he is talking to and slagged us all off. Then when Ian ended up dead people were excited to see who the next main character was. Everyone wanted to know about peters audience and who they were mainly watching caring about. Everyone wants to be the main character. \n\nWhen Janice was deemed the new main character, Janice was loving it and Peter even put her down right in front of her when he broke the 4th wall.

A mixture of rotting moss, soggy wood and the rusty metal of abandoned boats in the swamp. But in recent days, this smell has become heavier, denser, almost suffocating. Walking through the narrow, dirty streets filled me with a strange feeling, as if the city itself was decomposing. The recession has wiped everything out; People live in rags, waiting for a miracle that will not come.\n\n \n\nThe bodies began to appear a week ago. First, an old man, who everyone said was half crazy, was found on the edge of the swamp. It was shattered in a way I've never seen before, even in the worst murder cases I've investigated. The smell of fresh blood and torn flesh was intense, invading my nostrils like a slap. The sight was almost unbearable, but the hunger... hunger was worse. With each body, it grew inside me, a devouring monster that I struggled to keep in check.\n\n \n\nBut it wasn't just hunger that tormented me. It was the smell. A different smell hung in the air, something that chilled me to the bone. It wasn't the familiar smell of a vampire. It wasn't the metallic, earthy scent I was used to smelling. It was something much wilder, primal. Something that made me think of dark forests, of animals lurking in the tall bush. It was a smell of wet fur, sweat, and fresh blood.\n\n \n\nI knew I wasn't dealing with vampires. But, damn, I wish it was. I wanted it to be the Bellemonts, or any other damn vampire who wanted revenge. At least, I would know what to expect. But this? This thing that was tearing people apart on the streets? That was something else entirely. Something I've never faced before, not even in my worst nightmares.\n\n \n\nJeremiah came looking for me last night. He is still the same, despite the wrinkles and fatigue in his eyes. The weight of the years of investigation and the deaths he witnessed have turned him into an embittered man, but he still has that eagle eye, attentive to everything. He entered my hiding place with the same caution as always, as if at any moment I was going to jump on him. But it wasn't fear I saw in his eyes; it was respect. And maybe, just a little, compassion.\n\n \n\n\"Damon, there's something strange going on,\" he said, his face grim. \"These deaths... This is not the work of humans. Nor vampires, from what you've taught me.\"\n\n \n\nI knew he was right. I had been trying to get the idea out of my mind for days, but that smell, that feeling on my skin... It wasn't something I could ignore. I felt it deep in my bones. Something more cruel, more savage than a vampire was lurking in Bayou Noir. And he was teasing me.\n\n \n\n\"I know, Jeremiah,\" I replied, my voice hoarse from trying so hard to contain my hunger. \"But that doesn't change anything. Whatever it is, I'm going to hunt this thing. And I'm going to kill her.\"\n\n \n\nWe didn't exchange any more words that night. He knew what I was about to do. We would go hunting together, just like in the old days. I, the dark protector of this cursed city, and Jeremiah, my only friend, the man who still considers me human despite everything he has ever seen.\n\n \n\nThat same night, we began our search. The streets were deserted, except for the wretches who still wandered around looking for food or a place to sleep. Bayou Noir was smothered with fear, and I could feel it in every shadow, in every whisper of the wind. The smell of the swamp mixed with the stench of fear, creating an atmosphere that made my skin crawl.\n\n \n\nThen, the smell changed. It became more intense, more ferocious. An odor of wet fur and sweat began to invade my nostrils. Jeremiah felt it too, I saw him harden his jaw, his eyes attentive. We followed the smell, stronger and stronger, until we reached a narrow alley, where the air was almost impossible to breathe because it was so dense.\n\n \n\nThere, we found the body. Or what was left of it. It was a boy, maybe 14 years old. It was completely shattered, its limbs scattered on the ground as if severed by a gigantic animal. The smell of fresh blood mixed with the wild smell was so strong that it almost made me lose control. But that's not what made me freeze. It was the one next to the body.\n\n \n\nA huge, hairy creature, with eyes glowing with inhuman fury, was standing there, staring at me. It was a werewolf. I never thought I'd see one, but there it was, a monstrosity made of muscles, claws, and fangs. I knew, deep in my soul, that I was facing something far more dangerous than any vampire.\n\n \n\nBefore I could react, the werewolf pounced on me. There was no time to think, only to act. My vampiric reflexes were all that saved me from being torn apart at that moment. He was fast, brutal, but I was faster. Still, his strength was almost impossible to contain. The smell of wet fur and fresh blood enveloped me, distracting me, making me falter.\n\n \n\nJeremiah shot the werewolf, but the bullets had no effect. He laughed, that deep, animalistic laugh that made the ground shake. I took advantage of the distraction to dig my claws into him, trying to push him away. But he just grunted, as if I were a mere nuisance. The battle was fierce, brutal, and I felt my strength waver. But I couldn't let that thing live.\n\n \n\nWith one last blow, I managed to seriously injure him. Blood gushed out, mixing with the unbearable odor that was already hanging in the air. The werewolf retreated, but he was not defeated. Before he could deliver the final blow, he fled into the darkness of the swamp, leaving behind a trail of destruction and death.\n\n \n\nJeremiah helped me up. He was injured, but still whole. The hunt was just beginning, and I knew that the fight against this werewolf would be unlike anything I had ever faced. He wasn't just a beast, he was a force of nature, something wild and untamed. But I was also a force, a shadow on the streets of Bayou Noir. I would hunt him down, and kill him, whatever the cost.\n\n \n\nNow, the smell of blood and wet fur never leaves me. It is impregnated in me, like a constant reminder of what is lurking. Bayou Noir is in danger, and I'm the only one who can protect her. Every night, the swamp gets darker, denser, and I feel his presence, waiting, watching. But I'm no longer the man I once was. I am Damon Cordovil, the protector of this cursed city, and I will face this beast with everything I have.\n\n  \nContinue..."},"918":{"title":"DREAD VAN GORE!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evh9sw\/dread_van_gore\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Delicious_Feature_81","selftext":"My first creepy pasta, written and narrated by myself. https:\/\/youtu.be\/pDSX8zUesqE?si=ySwGITiKUPE3KvEv"},"919":{"title":"I'm looking for a creepypasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evg7nb\/im_looking_for_a_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"WalkingApocalpse","selftext":"I remember an old creepypasta from when I was younger that I believe Mrcreepypasta narrated that was about a kid who's parents became extremely obsessed with the 1984 Dune movie and I was curious is anyone remembered this or knew anything about this?"},"920":{"title":"The Ghostly Guardians of Gibraltar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1evcahb\/the_ghostly_guardians_of_gibraltar\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Beware of the Ghostly Guardians of Gibraltar, for they haunt the ancient walls with vengeance 👻🔒 Legend has it, they protect the fortress from intruders with spectral powers beyond human comprehension.

However, one game stood out for its mystery: Project Mojave. It was a project by Bethesda and Obsidian that was planned for release in 2007. Even IGN in 2006 confirmed the existence of a new Fallout game that was going to be much bigger than the previous two games. I vividly remember this article from that time. However, it later disappeared, and for a while, I thought it was a false memory. The article mentioned that Fallout 3 would be set in a vast world spanning California, Nevada, and Arizona, with a release date of January 27, 2007. This is the only detail I recall from the article. I tried searching for it on the Wayback Machine but found no trace of it. By chance, my best friend, who was an employee at Obsidian Entertainment at the time, revealed to me that he was one of the developers of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. He had previously worked on titles like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Thanks to him, I learned about the existence of Project Mojave. He had kept this information secret for years out of respect for Bethesda and Obsidian's confidentiality. I can understand that. I suppose there are things that don't have to be revealed or take many years to be revealed. But the day he told me about the previous version of Fallout 3 was crazy. Fallout 3 had two versions that never saw the light of day. The first one was Project Van Buren. It was going to have gameplay similar to the two previous games. But no one knew about the second version that was going to be released except for very few people who remember the 2006 article that I recall. Supposedly, my friend worked on both Fallout games between 2004 and 2008. He told me that Bethesda originally planned to make a game much larger than the original three and New Vegas. But it was canceled for being a much more sadistic, depressing, and realistic game. Bethesda and Obsidian wanted to make a game that would be a great successor to the two Fallout games. They wanted to make a much darker and more extensive game. The development lasted two and a half years. But Bethesda ultimately had to abandon the project. They feared that the game would be so mature that many countries would have to censor it. He said that the game was indeed very dark. The original Fallout 3 they were developing was so intense that it made games like GTA 4 or Manhunt look like games made for children.\n\nMy friend tells me that on the same day it was canceled, he was very angry with the people working at Bethesda. After many long discussions about the future of the project, Bethesda gave him no choice but to split the project into two games to work more easily on two projects that would have less development than the original Fallout 3. Many Bethesda and Obsidian employees did not like the idea. The good news is that they would use the same engine as the original project and put more than half of the characters from Project Mojave into New Vegas. Washington D.C. was originally a DLC that was going to be included in the previous project with a very different story than the other. This ultimately ended up becoming the Fallout 3 that we all know. Of all the things he told me, I asked if he still had the original game saved. My friend says he does. But he warns me never to tell anyone unless Bethesda or Obsidian reveal what Fallout 3 was before in the future. He also tells me that the game is only incomplete and only less than 15% of the game was left to be completed. This means that a few character and creature models are incomplete. In some parts of the map, the textures are unfinished. And some characters had no voice due to lack of voice actors. He gave me a very old flash drive that was very expensive to have in its time. He kept it because he said the game could have been better than what we have now. My friend is a big fan of the first game. So it makes sense. When I started the game on my PC, I was immediately captivated by the very dark atmosphere and the size of the map. Compared to the Fallout: New Vegas we knew, the Project Mojave map was vast, with desert landscapes stretching as far as the eye could see. But beyond its size, what really impressed me was the dark and disturbing tone that permeated every corner of the game. The gameplay was almost the same as the final product, with small differences like the movement and physics of the characters being a bit more realistic and the graphics being a bit uglier. But I can't blame the game for being from 2007. Also, like in the other games, you could customize your character. The game's narrative was deeply rooted in the protagonist's personal history. As I progressed through the story, I discovered that the main character was reliving traumatic memories of Vault 34. This faction, previously unknown, was portrayed as a shelter that turned into a nightmare. In a particularly heartbreaking mission, it is revealed how a group of raiders devastated the Vault, eliminating its inhabitants with a brutality that bordered on the unimaginable.\n\nThe screams of desperation and suffering from the protagonist's parents and sister impacted him as he hid in the closet. This experience deeply marked the protagonist, and the main mission revolved around his quest for revenge against the man responsible for this horrendous act. The gore in this game is also insane. Nothing compares to the classics. The bodies of humans and creatures have more organs that come out when you kill them in different ways. The Mojave in Project Mojave was a territory in conflict, divided between factions with varied ambitions and methods. The game's story shows a struggle for control of the Mojave, a region desired by both the NCR and Caesar's Legion. The Legion in this game was much more brutal and ruthless than in New Vegas. In Project Mojave, Caesar's Legion did not hesitate to carry out massacres and genocides against towns and tribes, showing even more extreme cruelty. I remember that when you travel to the town of Novac, you can see a scene of a group of legionaries executing men and women in front of children who witnessed the execution. I honestly felt very bad for them. After the scene, a child is shown crying non-stop after seeing his father being executed. In the Legion territories, you can also see them crucifying humans, ghouls, and super mutants, as the Legion has a deep hatred for traitors and non-human beings. There was also a special Legion soldier in purple called the \"Sanginarus.\" They rarely appeared in Legion camps and were very difficult to kill as they were the strongest soldiers of the Legion. The NCR was also present, but their presence was less prominent compared to the factions dominating the game. There are not many camps compared to New Vegas. Speaking of New Vegas, it is now a city in ruins, infested with ghouls and largely abandoned, a shadow of its former glory. Entering the city is very difficult, as you have to go through a tunnel infested with insects and very strong ghouls that will make the adventure miserable. Once inside the city, it's a different story. In addition to many enemies living in the city, you can also see many skeletons, graffiti, a skeleton of a tall man measuring four meters tall with armor that looked more or less like power armor. It wasn't a Behemoth, but what gave me the creeps was when it reminded me of Frank Horrigan. But still, the giant skeleton with armor was in the middle of the city. I don't think it's that character. Especially since you kill him at the end of Fallout 2. I didn't find anything related to Mr. House other than a very destroyed casino that had a painting of Benny inside it. The casinos had different names too.\n\nThe worst part of it all is that there are two songs playing in the city. The first one sounded like a depressing song with screams in the background. It was a bit disturbing. Second is a sad piano song with weird sounds in the background. Moving on from New Vegas, two new factions appear in Project Mojave and bring an interesting dynamic to the game. The first one was The Desert Boys, a confederation of tribes that had more or less the same motivations as the Great Khans. The Desert Boys sought to establish a network of united tribes in a confederation to defend themselves against common enemies, instead of falling into the clutches of larger and more violent factions. Their vision was to build a strong, autonomous, and cohesive Mojave, resisting the advance of the NCR and the Legion forces. The second faction was the White Saviours, successors of the Enclave with a very interesting goal. To turn the Mojave into a greener and healthier land, and to end wars and diseases through the exchange of scientific knowledge. However, behind their good side, they carried out human experiments to perfect their medicine, adding a layer of ambiguous morality to their actions. The leader of the faction is named Eliot Martimmer. This character is reminiscent of Father from Fallout 4. But in this game, he has a more charismatic and dangerous personality. Hidden Valley is the location where the main base of the White Saviours is located. In New Vegas, there is the Brotherhood of Steel. But apparently, the location was going to have the faction that they never added. Moving on from the factions, I want to talk about the atmosphere of the game. Many times you have sandstorms. They do not affect the player unless they are in a radioactive area. What made it difficult to be in a sandstorm is being chased by predators like Deathclaws. Many times you never know what is behind you. And that makes the experience more intense. You also see bodies of people, including minors, in places where there are battles between the NCR, Desert Boys, and the Legion. Bethesda would never allow the option to kill children in games. I guess seeing the Legion kill a child's parents was not enough for the developers. Half of the map is very dark due to the atmosphere, and compared to other Fallout games, that makes the game more mysterious. Half of the missions are almost the same or similar to the ones you had in New Vegas. The rest were new. There are three missions that left me very shocked. There was a woman who had a house near Primm. She was a cannibal woman who offered 600 caps in exchange for kidnapping 6 virgin women and men for her rituals. If you do her mission, she will take the women to a room you can't enter and you can hear screams and the women crying. Not sure what happens inside, but they keep screaming.\n\nThe second time you want to work with her, the woman then asks you to kidnap a child for a \"special ritual.\" I honestly didn't know whether to do the mission or tell the woman to go screw herself. When I told her no, she started going crazy, screaming in madness, and pulled out a knife and starts to attack me.I don't know what would have happened if I had accepted the offer, but I definitely didn't expect her to attack me. Her death made me steal a key to the room where she took the men and women. Inside the room it was a disgusting room full of corpses and penises of animals like a Deathclaw. Turns out when you read her diary, she was doing ritual of interspecies impregnation. It reminded me of playing those weird fallout mods. There is also a mission where you can help a boy search for his grandfather. But it turns out the clues lead to a group of super mutants eating the grandfather's corpse. The boy screams in horror and starts crying. I killed them and had to tell the boy that I'm sorry for the death of his grandfather. The boy doesn't say anything and walks slowly back to his house while still crying. What made this mission very ugly is the actor's performance as the boy. At that time, I hadn't heard such a good voice acting. It seems like the developers put a lot of realism into human suffering. That's something you don't see in other Fallout games. When you travel north, you come across Zion National Park. It's not the same as the Honest Hearts DLC. It was more beautiful, greener, and had a wide variety of plants and animals like many hostile mutants. While exploring, I encountered a large legendary creature that looked like a bear. The downside is that the bear model was incomplete. When it started attacking me, the game suddenly crashed. It wouldn't be the first time this happened to me, as there are missions or parts of the map that I couldn't complete due to these errors. But when I started the game again, the save was in the same place where the bear attacked me. How strange. He didn't appeared again. No matter which faction you play, no one likes super mutants. It was one of the Super Mutant genocide missions. The mission where you face the Super Mutants is a nightmare experience. If you play with any faction, all four sides want the Super Mutants dead. After many battles against them, there are many ways to suffer. But the scariest one is when you play with the White Saviours. You can hear recordings of experiments and see how the Super Mutants, once considered monsters, are now treated as test subjects and subjected to inhuman experiments. The brutality of the scene is almost unbearable; one wonders how Bethesda could allow such a story to exist in the game. I could talk more about the game. But unfortunately, the end of the story and also of your main character were not well completed. So I'm stuck in the story. As I progressed in the game, I began to see why Project Mojave had been cancelled. The story was too dark, the themes were too disturbing for a Fallout title that was positioning itself for a more open audience. The violence, sadism, and rawness had crossed a line that most players were not ready to cross. If this game had been released at that time, it would have been more controversial than any game at that time. Project Mojave offered an unforgettable and disturbing experience that left me thinking about the limits of what games can explore. Bethesda had made a difficult decision to cancel the project, but, in my opinion, there was something eerily fascinating about that forbidden game. Imagine what would have happened if this game had been released. Do you think it would have revolutionized in the same way Fallout 3 and New Vegas did? Now I see why my friend stopped working at Obsidian. Two and a half years of development just to be forgotten."},"923":{"title":"I Attended A Village’s Annual Feast for the First Time—What I Discovered Was Beyond Horrifying.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ev9hg3\/i_attended_a_villages_annual_feast_for_the_first\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"roracion","selftext":"I had never planned on settling in a remote village, but life had a way of taking unexpected turns. After losing my job in New York and finding myself with no clear direction and no place to live in next month, I accepted an offer to manage a small inn in the picturesque village of Thornwood. It was a tempting offer I must say, three times I tried negotiating for a higher rate than offered AND three times it got approved with no hesitation. Odd, it's like they really wanted me there, like they really needed my expertise that's not entirely unique to be perfectly honest. The owner seemed eager for me to work there asap and even offered to pay for my flight. How can a small inn afford to pay me this much and even pay for my flight going there? \"They must have really good food and always out of rooms for the night\" I thought to myself.\n\n\n\nThornwood is a place nestled deep in the mountains, it was the kind of place that seemed to be trapped in time—beautiful, serene, and isolated. The villagers were warm and welcoming (People there are a bit chatty though), working the inn was fun as well, but I couldn’t help but notice one peculiar tradition they had: the Silent Feast. It was an annual event held in the village square, and it intrigued me from the moment I arrived. The feast was a grand affair, with tables overflowing with extravagant dishes that would put any five-star restaurant to shame. But there was one strange rule: no one was allowed to speak or leave until the final dish was served. I asked the villagers about this unusual practice, but they always offered vague answers or changed the subject.\n\n\n\nCuriosity got the better of me, and I decided to attend the feast that year, see if it was as interesting as the villagers hype it to be. The event was held on the first full moon of autumn, and the entire village gathered for it. The air was crisp and filled with the aroma of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. Lanterns illuminated the square, casting an otherworldly glow over the scene. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, but the sheer spectacle of the feast was mesmerizing.\n\n\n\nAs the guests took their seats, the atmosphere was oddly hushed. The villagers communicated with nods and gestures, never uttering a word. I tried to engage in conversation with a few of them, but they simply smiled and pointed to their lips, indicating that speaking was not permitted.\n\n\n\nThe meal began, and the dishes were as incredible as they were diverse. The food was rich and flavorful, and I found myself indulging in the feast more than I had anticipated. Despite the silence, there was a palpable sense of excitement among the diners. I assumed it was due to the anticipation of the final dish.\n\n\n\nHours passed, and the feast continued. As the night wore on, I noticed something unsettling: the villagers were not eating like usual. Their movements were slow, almost ritualistic. Their eyes flickered nervously toward the village clocktower, which seemed to be ticking louder with each passing minute.\n\n\n\nI couldn't ignore a growing sense of dread. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to investigate why the feast was so deafeningly silent, I could hear all the chewing and food going through their throats. Disgusting. I slipped away from the table and ventured toward the back of the square, where I saw a few villagers sneaking glances around a large, ornate door hidden behind a curtain.\n\n\n\nMy heart raced as I approached the door and pushed it open slightly. What I saw inside made my blood run cold. The room beyond was filled with eerie, flickering candlelight and strange symbols painted on the walls. In the center of the room was an altar covered with an intricate cloth. A large, covered dish sat upon it, and as I peered closer, I saw that the villagers were converging on this altar, their expressions a mix of fear and reverence.\n\n\n\nJust then, a high-pitched, agonized wail echoed through the room, making me jump. The villagers fell silent, their faces frozen in terror. I realized then that the final dish wasn’t just a meal; it was part of a macabre ritual. The wail came from beneath the altar, and I could see the dish trembling as if something was trying to escape from it.\n\n\n\nPanicked, I stumbled back toward the feast, but as I turned around, I noticed something horrifying: the door to the village square was shut tight, and a crowd of villagers stood in front of it, blocking the exit. I tried to call out, but the rules of the feast held me in place. I could only watch in horror as the villagers' expressions turned to glee, as if the wail had confirmed their darkest fears.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a loud crash echoed through the square, and the ground began to tremble. The villagers remained seated, unmoving, their eyes fixed on the final dish. The wail grew louder, more desperate, until it became an unbearable shriek. And then, as if by some dark magic, the final dish was revealed.\n\n\n\nInside the dish was a horrifying sight—a grotesque, living creature writhing and convulsing, its eyes filled with a mixture of terror and pain. The creature looked human but not exactly. Like it USED to be human, the way it curled up into the fetal position while unnaturally shaking it's head in pain and wailing creeped me the f\\*ck out. The villagers began chanting in unison, their voices rising in a crescendo of eerie harmony. The creature’s wails grew weaker until, finally, it fell silent.\n\n\n\nI was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. The villagers began to eat the final dish, their faces reflecting a twisted satisfaction, face messy with blood like eating a very saucy spaghetti. It was then that I realized the true purpose of the Silent Feast: it was a sacrificial ritual, designed to appease an ancient and malevolent entity that demanded a horrifying tribute.\n\n\n\nAs the feast came to an end, the villagers finally acknowledged me, their eyes gleaming with something sinister. I knew I had to escape, but the villagers were closing in, their intentions clear. I bolted toward the door, fighting through the crowd. My heart pounded as I broke free and ran into the night, the wails of the creature still echoing in my ears.\n\n\n\nI escaped Thornwood that night, booked a flight without even going back to retrieve my stuff. The airport was a bit far from Thornwood (1-2 hours on car) so I had to walk and run and then walk again just to get the f\\*ck out of there. I never looked back, I knew some villagers were still chasing me though, I could hear the footsteps in the same rhythm as mine. I can never forget what I witnessed. The village has since disappeared from maps and records, it's like they were afraid of me reporting them to the police or something. But every year, on the night of the Silent Feast, I can still hear the wails and see the flickering lights in my nightmares.\n\n\n\nLast night, I saw someone standing outside my window, peering in. When I stared back, they continued walking on the sidewalk as if nothing had happened. It was especially unsettling since my apartment is on the ground floor. When I woke up this morning, I noticed that my back door had been forcefully opened, but nothing was stolen. My shiny new Macbook (the only expensive thing I own) was still on the dinner table, and other valuables were on display in my living room, ready to be taken. I briefly wondered if they wanted to kill me for no reason, like serial killers do. Luckily, I always double-lock my bedroom door, thanks to... Thornwood. Damn, just saying that name still gives me chills. After some reflection, I came to a conclusion that sent shivers down my spine, scarier than the thought of a potential serial killer sneaking into my home while I slept peacefully—I was marked as a sacrifice, and they NEED me to fulfill their ritual.\n\n\n\nNote: Before I meet my inevitable end, I got obsessed with details of the weird ritual they call \"Silent Feast\" which I realized is drawing near. It's odd though why it took 2 years for them to come after me, did they run out of sacrifices for this year's feast? Do they stock their sacrifices like livestock? I feel like there's an invisible tag hanging around my neck, just like a cow marked for slaughter. Never in my life I got this obsessed with something. It’s as if I’m compelled to unravel every sinister detail, as though knowing more will somehow change my fate. I guess this is how people are who are marked for death.\n\n\n\nHere are the notes I’ve pieced together from old books, decades-old newspapers, and a former Thornwood resident who escaped after watching someone he loved turn into the final dish. He claimed this happened 30 years ago, but it still horrifies him. I found him on a subreddit talking about Thornwood but people just assumed he’s crazy. There’s this line that stuck out to me throughout the interview “I wish I asked her to run away with me sooner, I wish I hadn’t waited how she’ll look like after being transformed. Every creature had their own unique metamorphosis. I was young and naive back then, you see. Curiosity is a certified killer.” I mean, WTF right? Safe to say that he was a very disturbed person back then, I guess Thornwood’s Silent Feast does that to you. Nonetheless, he gave me vital information that might help appease my obsession. This will be the last thing I’ll write. I don’t know. *Pray for me*.\n\n\n\n—————————-\n\n\n\n**Origin of the Creature**\n\n\n\nThe creature is a product of ancient, dark magic rooted in the village’s history. Centuries ago, Thornwood was founded on a cursed land, and the villagers’ ancestors made a pact with an otherworldly entity, called “Vorax Umbra” by their ancestors before them, to ensure the prosperity and protection of their home. This entity’s name if translated to modern English, comes out to “The Devourer”. A fitting name. It demanded a yearly sacrifice to maintain its favor and keep the village safe from supernatural threats.\n\n\n\nTo fulfill this pact, the villagers devised a ritual to create a creature that embodies their most profound fears and suffering. The ritual involves capturing an individual (often an outsider or a resident deemed unworthy) and subjecting them to a process of dark transformation.\n\n\n\n**The Transformation Process**:\n\n\n\n**Sacrificial Ritual**: On the night of the Silent Feast, a chosen victim is taken to a hidden chamber beneath the village. Here, they are bound and subjected to a series of dark, occult ceremonies designed to channel their life force into a physical form.\n\n\n\n**Summoning and Binding**: The villagers use ancient incantations and symbols to summon the dark energies of The Devourer. These energies are channeled into the victim, causing their flesh to twist and contort in unnatural ways. The ritual binds the victim’s suffering and essence into a single, grotesque form that will become the creature.\n\n\n\n**Transformation**: The process of transformation involves both physical and spiritual alterations. The victim’s body is reshaped into the nightmarish entity seen at the feast, a being that embodies both their torment and the dark power of The Devourer. This creature is then placed into the final dish as a horrifying spectacle of the village’s devotion.\n\n\n\n**The Final Dish**: During the feast, the creature is revealed as the final dish, symbolizing the culmination of the ritual and the appeasement of The Devourer. Eating the creature is both an act of homage and a means to ensure the continued favor of the entity.\n\n\n\nThe existence of the creature is thus a direct result of this ancient and malevolent ritual. It serves as a reminder of the village’s pact and the dark forces that sustain their existence. The creature’s writhing and convulsing are manifestations of the victim’s last moments of suffering, forever trapped in a twisted form designed to fulfill the ritual’s demands.\n\n\n\n—————————-\n\n\n\n**Why Villagers Must Stay Silent at the Feast**\n\n\n\n**Preventing the Awakening of the Creature**: The grotesque creature, formed from the sacrificial victim, is kept in a dormant state by the silence of the feast. Any noise or disturbance could trigger its awakening or agitation. The creature’s presence is tied to the dark ritual, and noise might disrupt its magical bindings or bring it to life prematurely.\n\n\n\n**Maintaining the Ritual’s Integrity**: Silence is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the ritual that appeases The Devourer. The ritual relies on an atmosphere of absolute calm and reverence. Noise could disrupt the mystical energies involved and nullify the effectiveness of the offering, thereby breaking the bond between the villagers and The Devourer.\n\n\n\n**Preventing the Spread of the Dark Power**: The feast serves as a form of dark communion between the villagers and The Devourer. If the villagers were to speak, it might spread or amplify the dark power inherent in the ritual. Silence helps contain this power and ensures it remains focused on the creature, rather than dispersing and potentially causing harm or inviting unwanted supernatural entities.\n\n\n\n**Ensuring the Creature’s Concealment**: The grotesque creature is a source of immense fear and revulsion. By enforcing silence, the villagers prevent the creature from being fully revealed or scrutinized. The silence acts as a form of psychological control, keeping the true nature of the creature hidden from the feast-goers and ensuring that no one can speak about or describe it.\n\n\n\n**Enforcing a Psychological Bond**: The requirement for silence creates a psychological atmosphere of tension and dread. It forces the attendees to focus on the feast and the ritual, rather than questioning or disrupting it. This silence reinforces the villagers’ submission to the tradition and their role in maintaining the pact with The Devourer.\n\n\n\n**Ensuring Ritual Compliance**: Silence during the feast ensures that everyone complies with the ritual’s requirements. It prevents any dissent or disobedience that might arise if people were allowed to talk or express their doubts. The fear of punishment for breaking silence (disappearance) acts as a powerful deterrent, ensuring that everyone remains compliant and adheres to the ritual.\n\n\n\n—————————-\n\n\n\n**How Eating the Creature Appeases The Devourer**\n\n\n\n**Symbolic Consumption of Suffering**: The ritual of consuming the grotesque creature is not merely about satisfying a physical hunger but is deeply symbolic. The creature, formed from the torment and agony of the sacrificial victim, represents the culmination of suffering and fear. By eating it, the villagers symbolically consume the essence of this suffering, acknowledging their debt to The Devourer and demonstrating their willingness to endure and perpetuate the pact.\n\n\n\n**Transference of Power**: The Devourer is a being that feeds on the life force and suffering of others. The grotesque creature is imbued with dark energies and the essence of the victim’s agony. By consuming the creature, the villagers transfer this accumulated power back to The Devourer. This act of consumption is seen as a direct offering of energy and sustenance, satisfying the entity’s hunger for despair and ensuring its continued favor.\n\n\n\n**Fulfillment of the Pact**: The original pact made with The Devourer required a ritualistic sacrifice to maintain the village’s prosperity and protection. Eating the grotesque creature is the final act in this ritual, completing the ceremonial cycle. It is believed that by consuming the creature, the villagers are honoring their agreement and thereby securing their safety and fortune for another year. The act of eating is seen as an act of submission and devotion, reinforcing their ongoing commitment to the entity.\n\n\n\n**Mystical Bonding**: The grotesque creature is not merely a physical manifestation but also a vessel for dark, mystical forces. Eating it is believed to create a metaphysical bond between the villagers and The Devourer. This bond is thought to strengthen the entity’s connection to the village, ensuring that it remains influential and protective. The ritual consumption acts as a form of communion with The Devourer, reinforcing the mystical link that ties the village to the dark forces it serves.\n\n\n\n**Release of the Victim’s Essence**: The victim’s essence, trapped and twisted into the creature’s form, is released when consumed. This release is believed to satisfy The Devourer’s demand for the victim’s soul and suffering. The act of eating is seen as a way of giving closure to the victim’s torment, allowing their essence to pass into The Devourer and thereby completing the sacrificial cycle.\n\n"},"924":{"title":"I am finding domino's being set up all over my house ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ev7gsh\/i_am_finding_dominos_being_set_up_all_over_my\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"\n\nI came home to my small 2 bed house to find domino's all over the place.

I love the sound that it makes, when one by one each domino is being knocked down. Let's not forget the patterns domino's make as they are knocking each other down. Domino's are kind of symbolic because when you knock one down, it takes the rest of the domino's down with it. It's similar in life when one thing affects another. \n\nAny how as I came home after a day of work, it's just me who lives here now. It's real silent these days and I find domino's all over my house. It's not just on the floors but domino's were all over the place. They were on the walls and even on the ceiling, the domino's were defying physics. When I knocked one domino down it set off knocking all of the domino's down. It was wonderful to see and it followed through in order. Even when the domino's on the walls and ceilings were being knocked down, they were still stuck on the walls and ceilings. \n\nThen when all of the domino's were knocked down, the domino's stuck on the walls and ceilings came crashing down to the floor. It was a strange sight to see but it was amazing. The sound that it makes when they are all being knocked down, it's soothing. So every day when I come home from work, I would find these domino's lined up all over the house. I would also find them lined up in impossible places where they are defying physics and i live alone.

We both delighted at the sight of seeing domino's all lined up, all over the house. It was lined up in the ceilings and walls and in awkward places. I first knocked them down and it was a delight to see them all being knocked down. Then when they domino's followed through into the food cupboard in the kitchen, it stopped. There was no light in the food cupboard kitchen, and so when my friend stepped into the kitchen cupboard, he screamed and his whole body fell to the floor. \n\nThen the domino's started knocking each other down again in order. I didn't touch my friends body as I was scared. Then when I came home from work on another day, I saw that the domino's were lined up again, and they were even lined up on my friends dead body. \n\nThe way the domino's were lined up on my friends dead body, it's like whatever was doing this doesn't give a shit. The domino's should have fallen off from my friends awkwardly shaped body, but they defy physics. \n"},"925":{"title":"Recommendations?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ev662u\/recommendations\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"shootdack2000","selftext":"I'm looking for some recommendations for any story's that don't actually have a monster or real antagonists or just in general something that gives you the feeling of emptiness a d unease, I.e Ted the caver."},"926":{"title":"I am everything wrong with myself ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ev4k2a\/i_am_everything_wrong_with_myself\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Eldritch_Mess666","selftext":"I have been haunted by strange dreams recently.

He ended up possessing all of his sex dolls since his spirit never left the house.  After talking to my therapist, Lucas, I ended up making a deal with the dolls to let them \"live\" with me for a month.  (Basically the dolls are possessed by Brad's spirit and unless I actually \"use\" the dolls for their intended purpose, Brad will stay in the dolls content on living life inside of the dolls he loved in life.)  Well, it got *weird* now.  \n\nI can't sleep tonight and I stayed up and found out the dolls are *in my bed* when I sleep.  Now I am a heavy sleeper and nothing gets me up.  A raid alarm would sound and if I wasn't lightly sleeping my ass would be dead in that emergency scenario.  Now for sake of brevity I don't have actual sex with these dolls, as part of the deal I made with them it was a condition while he was inside of the dolls, if I have sex with them Brad will leave them and wreak havoc on the earth.  Plus, dolls aren't really something I get excited by.\n\nAnyway I woke up sporadically for some reason, and in the little bit of light in the room I saw a body, in bed with me, a *female body*.  I let out a little gasp and pulled back.  \"The fuck?\" I said quietly but also a bit angrily.  The body moved and  turned to me.  *Oh.. Oh shit you're awake.* The voice said, 'Wait, is that Christina?' I thought. \"Christina?  What are you doing in here?\" I asked.  *I didn't realize you were awake.  Sorry for disturbing you, I've been I'm here for an hour.  I'll leave.*  The doll started to set up and swing their legs over the bed jankily.  \"Hey Christina wait!  Why are you in here?\" *Oh we've been sleeping with you for a couple of hours each night.  We've taken turns to be honest this was my turn to sleep with you.*  \"You aren't trying to get me to lose the bet right?\" *Oh heavens no.  I wouldn't want Brad to get out of us.  We just feel lonely at times.* \"Lonely?\" *I know it's funny, a doll with a possessed spirit inside of them of their previous owner feeling lonely.  But still Brad has kept us alive and autonomous and as you've helped clean us up and take care of us when we couldn't do it ourselves we've almost come to see you as part of our family now.* \n\nI sat there in thought, I coughed a little and put on my glasses.  \"So by sleeping with me you see me as your owner now?\" *Well.. maybe not quite like that but yes to a degree.

Even from the road, it was a blight on the otherwise pristine New England landscape. A ramshackle Victorian, it was swallowed by overgrown vines and shrouded in a neglect that seemed to seep from its very bones.\n\n       The official report would be clinical, detached. But the reality was far more visceral. The stench hit me like a physical blow as I stepped onto the porch. It was a sickly sweet rot, the odor of decay and something more sinister. A mountain of mail and discarded newspapers blocked the front door, a testament to the isolation of those inside. \n\n      I forced my way in, the squeak of protesting wood echoing in the heavy silence, the stench hitting like a brick. What unfolded before me was a scene from a nightmare, an obscene tableau of violence and depravity. Three bodies lay twisted and mutilated in the heart of the home. Sarah, David, and Michael Green, their lives extinguished in a brutal, savage manner. The room was a macabre gallery of their final terror, furniture overturned, blood spattered.\n\n      The official report would detail the wounds, the dismemberment, the defensive injuries. But as a man, a father, I couldn’t escape the humanity of it all. These were people, once living, breathing, with hopes and dreams. Now they were reduced to this: a grotesque puzzle scattered across a blood-soaked carpet.\n\n      A heavy metal door, secured with industrial-grade padlocks, hinted at a hidden world beneath the house. With a forced entry, I descended into a subterranean hell. The air was thick with the stench of urine and decay, a miasma that clung to the throat. Chained to a cold, unforgiving metal beam was a skeletal figure, a child. Elias Dun Green, lost and forgotten in the depths of this twisted household.\n\n      The basement was a chamber of horrors, a testament to unimaginable cruelty. Bloody restraints, crude medical equipment, and the haunting remnants of a child’s existence painted a picture of prolonged torture. The walls were a grotesque gallery, filled with the desperate scrawls of a terrified mind.\n\n      As I moved through the house, gathering evidence, the weight of the crime pressed down on me. There was more to this than a simple murder. Drugs, guns, a life lived in the shadows. The Green family, once ordinary people, had become entangled in a world of darkness and violence. \n\n      Who could do this? Someone with a monstrous capacity for evil, someone with a connection to this family. The house held secrets, but would they ever be revealed? \n\n      I left the Green residence that day a changed man. The evil I had witnessed that afternoon would forever be etched into my soul. \n \n      Officer Anderson paused, his pen hovering over the report. He stared out the window, lost in the memory. The case of the Green family murders was a wound that would never truly heal. \n\n“Police Report\n\nReporting Officer’s Name: William Anderson\nBadge Number: PD4579\nDate: 10\/12\/2018\nTime: 3:00 PM\nLocation: Morristown, Vermont\nCase Number: MPD181012001\nIncident Type: Homicide\nReporting Party: Anonymous\nComplainant: None\nVictims: Sarah Green, David Green, Michael Green\nSuspect: Unknown\n\nOfficer’s Notes:\n\nUpon arrival at the Green residence, located at [address redacted], I was met with an overwhelming stench of decay and a disturbingly cluttered front porch. Mail was piled high, newspapers overflowed from the mailbox, and the overall appearance of the property suggested prolonged neglect. \n\nForcing entry into the residence, I was immediately confronted with a scene of horrific violence. The bodies of three individuals, later identified as Sarah Green, David Green, and Michael Green, were found within the main living area. The victims exhibited extreme mutilation, including dismemberment and what appeared to be defensive wounds. The nature of the injuries suggests a high degree of force and a possible weapon with a sharp edge.\n\nEvidence recovered at the scene indicates a violent struggle. Furniture was overturned. A heavy metal door, secured with multiple padlocks, was discovered leading to the basement. After gaining access, officers found a crudely constructed, underground chamber. The room was dark and damp, with the overpowering stench of urine and feces.\n\nA young boy, approximately 10 years of age, was discovered chained to a metal support beam in the center of the room. The boy was emaciated, with visible signs of severe malnutrition and physical abuse. It is believed this child is Elias Dun Green, the missing son of the victims. Unfortunately, the child was deceased upon discovery along with evidence of sexual assault.\n\nThe basement contained evidence of prolonged captivity and torture. Several bloody belts and chains were found, as well as medical supplies, suggesting attempts at rudimentary care. The walls of the basement were covered in crude, childlike drawings and markings.\n\nIn addition to the physical evidence, a strong odor of chemicals was present throughout the residence. The Vermont State Police Hazardous Materials Unit was called to the scene to investigate. Preliminary findings suggest the presence of substances consistent with drug manufacturing and distribution.\n\nA subsequent search of the property yielded additional evidence supporting the victims’ involvement in criminal activity. Drug paraphernalia, large sums of cash, and several firearms were recovered from various locations within the residence.\n\nBased on the preliminary investigation, it is believed that the Green family was involved in a dangerous lifestyle that ultimately led to their violent demise. The motive for the murders remains a drug dealer gone wrong at this time.\n\nThe identity of the perpetrator remains a mystery. There were no signs of forced entry into the main residence, suggesting the possibility of an inside job or someone known to the victims. \n\nThe investigation into the Green family murders is ongoing. Additional evidence collection and analysis will be conducted in an effort to identify the perpetrator and bring closure to this horrific case.\n \n[End of Report]”\n\n[Some time later]\n\n      The case of the Green family murders haunted Morristown for years. Despite the exhaustive investigation, the perpetrator remained elusive. Over time, the gruesome details faded into a collective nightmare, a dark stain on the town’s history. \n\n      Yet, the woods surrounding the Green residence held their own secrets. Locals began to report unsettling encounters. Strange occurrences, inexplicable disappearances of troubled individuals, and a growing sense of unease permeated the once tranquil forest. Some whispered of a shadowy figure, a silent watcher with an otherworldly aura.\n\nThey called him Bunny.\n\n      Descriptions varied, but a common thread emerged: a figure clad in a gray hooded shirt with red and white striped sleeves. His face was obscured by a featureless, white bunny mask, lending him a chilling anonymity. Sightings were sporadic, often accompanied by an eerie silence or an inexplicable chill.\n\n      As the months passed, the town began to change. The underbelly of crime, once a festering wound, seemed to vanish. Drug dealers, known abusers, individuals with a history of violence – they were found brutally Mutilated. It was as if a silent purge had swept through the community. \n\n      The woods, once feared, became a place of solace for some. People found peace amidst the towering trees, a sense of renewal in nature’s embrace. Yet, an undercurrent of unease persisted. The legend of Bunny grew, a folklore of fear and fascination.\n\n      Some say he is a guardian, a protector of the innocent. Others believe him to be a harbinger of retribution, a phantom of justice. Whatever the truth, the shadow of the Green family murders continues to loom large, intertwined with the enigmatic figure known as Bunny.\n\n      The house on Green Street remains abandoned, a decaying monument to tragedy. It stands as a stark reminder of the darkness that once resided within its walls, and of the mysterious force that may still linger in the woods beyond.\n \n      Officer Anderson, haunted by the case, often found himself drawn to the edge of the woods. There, in the twilight, he would stand and watch, searching for answers in the rustling leaves and the shadows that danced in the undergrowth. He had seen too much darkness to believe in simple explanations. The truth, he knew, was far more complex, more terrifying, and perhaps closer than he dared to imagine. \n\n\n(BUNNY) or Elias dun green"},"936":{"title":"what is this creepy pasta?

There was a yellow circle of where I should stand behind the bench. I stood there from 8AM to 3pm and then I went home. It was an odd job but it gave me some income for the time being. Beggars can't be choosers. \n\nAnyway as I stood inside the yellow circle behind the bench, the circle was drawn to be a specific measurement away from the bench. Exactly how like the sun is a specific measurement away from the earth. I decided to just step out of the circle where I was much closer to the bench, and people jogging on the field who were further down from the bench, they started screaming. Then I stepped back into the circle and the joggers wiped their eyes as if they were seeing things. I had no idea what had happened and why the joggers further down the field started screaming when I stepped out of the yellow circle. \n\nThen I stepped out of the yellow circle again and people started screaming. This time I was further away from the bench and when I went back into the circle, passer bys further down the field started rubbing their eyes, as if they had seen something. Something was off and I couldn't tell what it was. My curiosity was getting the better of me and I needed to see why people were screaming when I stepped out of the yellow circle. I had to see and when I stepped out of the circle, passer bys in the distance started screaming. \n\nThe bench is placed pretty high up on the field and when i checked to see what was on the bench, it was a headless body.

As a budding actor, every job opportunity was crucial, and I needed to be prepared. I lived alone in a small apartment on the third floor of an old building in Harlem. The neighborhood was relatively quiet, but there were always stories about strange things happening at night.\r\n\r\nThe distant hum of traffic and the occasional sirens were part of the usual background noise, but that night, something more sinister was about to unfold. I could hear the soft sound of my script's pages as I flipped through them, completely immersed in the words. Suddenly, an unexpected sound shattered the silence. It was the sound of heavy footsteps ascending the building's stairs. At first, I didn't think much of it, assuming a neighbor was returning home late at night. But then the footsteps stopped right in front of my door, sending a chill down my spine.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking, I called out the name of a friend who sometimes dropped by unannounced. “Mike, is that you?” I asked, hoping for a familiar response. But all I heard was absolute silence. A wave of nervousness washed over me, but I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was just a neighbor passing by, and I had imagined it. However, as I approached the door, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the stairs, as if someone was fleeing in a rush.\r\n\r\nMy heart started to race. I backed away from the door, now fully aware that whoever had been there wasn't my friend. Fear began to set in as I pondered what to do. I thought about calling the police, but what would I say? That I heard someone running down the stairs? I decided it was best to let it go and locked the door with every bolt.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed, I couldn't shake the incident from my mind. I shared the story with some friends and family, but they all dismissed it, saying it was probably just a neighbor in a hurry. Yet the feeling that something was wrong never left me. I started hearing noises at night: faint taps, as if someone was trying to get in. But whenever I checked, no one was there.\r\n\r\nA week later, I decided to move to a new apartment. I found a place in another part of the city and started packing. The night before my move, as I was finishing up, I heard the same sound of footsteps climbing the stairs. This time, the steps were slower, as if someone was deliberately approaching.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps stopped right in front of my door again. This time, I didn't call out to anyone. I knew that whoever it was, they weren't welcome. I stayed silent, hoping the person would go away. But then, something shocking happened. The front door, which I had locked, started shaking violently, as if someone was trying to force their way in.\r\n\r\nI ran to the kitchen, grabbing the sharpest knife I could find. I was trembling, the terror gripping my body. The banging on the door grew more intense, and I felt like it could give way at any moment. Suddenly, everything stopped. The silence that followed was terrifying, almost worse than the noise. I stood still, my breath shaky. After a few minutes, I mustered up the courage to look through the peephole, but no one was there.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I left the apartment in a hurry, not looking back. I moved to the new place and tried to forget what had happened. But the story didn't end there. Days later, I heard some disturbing news: a body had been found in the basement of my old building, wrapped in plastic bags. The victim was a woman who had been missing for weeks.\r\n\r\nThe discovery made me question whether what I experienced that night was connected to the crime. Maybe the killer was using the building as a hideout. Maybe I had been watched by someone with malicious intentions. I tried to push these thoughts away, but they kept haunting me. I knew that if I had gone down the stairs that night, it could have been me instead of the woman.\r\n\r\nA few months passed, and I was starting to feel safe again. But one night, in the new apartment, while I was lying in bed, I heard a familiar sound. Footsteps, slowly making their way up the stairs. My fear returned with full force. Whoever or whatever it was, it seemed to have found my new address.\r\n\r\nThe sound stopped right outside my door, just like before. I couldn’t move, only waiting. Then, with a loud click, the apartment lights went out. Panic seized me, and I rushed to grab the knife again, but when I turned on the lights with my phone, I noticed something terrible: my door was open, as if someone had entered.\r\n\r\nI turned slowly, sweat dripping down my face. The darkness of the hallway seemed thicker than usual, and I felt that something or someone was there, watching me. Without a second thought, I bolted out of the apartment, running down the stairs as fast as I could. I never went back.\r\n\r\nI left New York, moving to a small town in the countryside, hoping to find peace. But what I didn't realize was that, no matter where I went, the footsteps on the stairs would follow me. Because, for whatever was chasing me, the hunt wasn't over yet.\r\n"},"942":{"title":"The Ghost Train of WWII France","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1eulj9j\/the_ghost_train_of_wwii_france\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Have you heard of the spectral train that haunted WWII France?

He doesn't go out or do exercise and he just magic's his way through everything. Instead of walking he will just magic himself to any place. Instead of lifting he will just use magic to lift it and this is an epidemic among the youth as they cannot be bothered using their bodies anymore. We are trying to tell them that exercise is important but they just done listen. They can't be bothered running around, or walking and lifting anything. They just use magic to get to places and to pick things up. \n\nI try to tell my son how important it is to use his body to burn fat, but he doesn't care. I tell him how important it is to actually fight back physically, rather than to just use magic. He needs to use his body or he will start to have bodily problems. Yes he could just magic that away but the problems come back even worse. He could magic the fat away but he will become even fatter in a couple of years time. It's just impossible and I just want him to use his body. \n\nAlso kids entertain themselves through magic and it's destroying their minds. Without magic they don't seem to find anything else interesting. They become depressed and distressed.\n\nSo many kids have been getting diabetes, cancer and are just so obese. Some kids have been even getting heart attacks and I know my son will be next. One kid tried getting rid of his fat through magic, but he became even fatter in a couple of years time. Magic just makes them more lazy and I would even consider my son to get bullied, so that he knows how others will see him. If the bullies even chase him around I will be happy with that because he is using his body. I just want him to stop using magic. \n\nSo I started hiding his wand and he had no choice but to use his body. He was picking things up and walking around. It was good for him. Then my son said that there is an evil person killing people through magic and I didn't listen to him. All I cared was about his health and I didn't really think anything would happen to my son. Right now it was his health that worried me and the guy killing people through magic, he was mainly targeting a specific group as he was racist, and we are not part of that group. \n\nThen when my son ended up dead, because of the guy who went round killing people with magic and the guy also decided to start killing kids.

I dropped out of school a couple of years ago, and this was the best job I could find. The hours are long, and it gets lonely, but it’s steady work, and right now, I need the money. Most nights are routine. I start by stocking the shelves, making sure the coolers are filled with drinks, and organizing the racks with chips and snacks. The store is usually quiet, allowing me to get these tasks done. After that, I sweep the floors, wipe down the counters, and clean up whatever mess the daytime customers left behind. It’s monotonous, but it’s work.  \n  \nOn this particular night, I was working with a coworker—one of those rare overlaps in our shifts. We exchanged a few words, but mostly, we kept to our own tasks. He manned the register while I took care of the cleaning. It was a welcome change to have someone else around, even if it was just for a brief period.  \n  \nAround midnight, a man walked in who clearly didn’t belong. He was ragged, with dirty clothes and matted hair. My coworker and I exchanged uneasy glances as he wandered aimlessly through the store. I was near the cooler, restocking drinks, when he walked past me. His odor was overpowering—a mix of sweat and something more foul, like rotting food. He kept both hands buried deep in his jacket pockets, as if concealing something. His presence was unsettling, but I tried to focus on my task, doing my best to ignore the strange feeling creeping over me. he headed straight for the bathroom without a word. My coworker raised an eyebrow, but I just nodded, signaling it was fine. We waited, expecting him to be quick, but he lingered for a long time. When he finally emerged, his eyes locked onto mine in a way that sent a chill down my spine.  he had an evil grin on his face, almost like he was holding back a laugh, then he walked out, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.  \n  \nI tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was nothing and went back to restocking the beers.  As my shift was nearing it's end, I needed to do a final cleaning of the bathroom.  I always save the bathroom for last. It’s by far the worst part of this job. The bathroom is a disaster - piss on the floor, shit smeared on the toilet seat. It’s enough to make anyone lose faith in humanity. I hate going in there, but I need this job, so I push through.  \n  \nGathering my mop, bucket, and cleaning supplies, I prepared myself for the stench, and opened the door.  The automatic light system didn't kick on, which gave the bathroom that erie feeling to it. Since I guessed the guy accidently switched off the main switch on the wall, I reached my hand over to feel for the toggle.  I flipped it on, and to my horror I saw the sink.  Running down the sides of the sink were dropplets of watery blood, as if someone was washing their blood stained hands.  I immediately knew it must have been from that man with the jacket. My heart began to race. I looked around the room for anything else that might concerning.  There wasn't anything that stood out, but as I started to turn to go back to the cashier to tell my coworker, something in the trash can caught my eye.  There were blood stained paper towels that looked placed on top of something. My hands trembled as I used my mop stick to push the towels aside to reveal a bloodied knife.  \n  \nPanic set in. I stumbled out of the bathroom and told my coworker what I’d found. We both agreed to call the police. I reported the discovery, and a cop arrived shortly after, taking the knife and asking to review the security footage. We watched as the homeless-looking man walked in and headed straight for the bathroom. There was one other person who used the bathroom that night, but he seemed completely normal. The officer said he’d check around the building and might need to bring in investigators. He instructed me to close off the bathroom to prevent anyone else from entering.  \n  \nI grabbed some tape and started sealing the bathroom door, my hands unsteady. As I was taping it shut, more police cars began arriving, their lights flashing and radios crackling. The officers converged on the dumpster behind the gas station. My gut twisted with dread. A few minutes later, one of them came inside and delivered the grim news—a body had been found hidden behind the dumpster.  \n  \nThe realization hit me like a ton of bricks. The man who had been in and out of the store wasn’t just a random drifter. He had left a body behind. The detectives questioned me about the knife and whether I’d touched it. I recounted everything I knew as they took pictures and collected evidence.  \n  \nThe horror of that night lingered long after the police left. I continued working at the gas station for a couple of months, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread. Each night, I felt the weight of what had happened pressing down on me. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. I quit and moved to a different town. The memory of that night still haunts me, and I often wonder what might have happened if I hadn’t found that knife.

I searched quite a while but couldn't find it.   \n  \n**Summary:** it's mainly about a monster who moves when the victim blinks (not when eyes closed or open, only the \"blink\" itself) - so no weeping angle.\n\n**This is what I remember:**  \nThe story is told via a blog from a guy. He tells us about a monster which only moves when it's target blinks. And that it switches to the nearest person who notices it afterwards. \n\nHe tells us about how at first some acquaintances who died of it and that it took some time for them\/him to notice it's pattern. Over the time we learn that his brother (I think) was the victim before him and thought that making him unable to blink (poping out the eyes or so) would solve it. But the monster changed its pattern after a while. It moved every time he moved his head, reacting to something. He died before the writer\/his brother could stop him from moving. So he died.\n\nThe story follows with our protagonist becomming more insane, his life qualoty dropping. In the end he writes, that he has an idea and will confront the monster. So he does and after that it is (clearly written by the monster), that the monster is good and that there is no need to worry.

It is loosely based on the 11 miles one.\n\nAre any of you interested in reviewing it?\n\n***Edit***\n\nThe 12th Mile\n\nThey told me that the road was a straight shot, just 11 miles between me and my deepest desire. The whispers I found online, buried in forgotten forums and obscure chat rooms, all spoke of the same thing: make it through the 11 miles, follow the rules, and your wish would be granted. But none of them said what would happen if you failed.\n\nI was desperate so so desperate enough to drive out in the dead of night searching for something that might not even exist. But when the headlights of my old sedan swept over the narrow, unmarked road cutting through the dense forest, I knew I’d found it. My heart raced as I turned onto the gravel, feeling the crunch beneath my tires. \n\nThe first mile was nothing. Just darkness pressing in from all sides, the trees standing like silent sentinels. By the fifth mile, the air inside the car had turned unnaturally cold, and the radio, which I had left on to stave off the silence, crackled with static before going dead altogether.\n\nMile six brought the whispers—faint at first, like the rustling of leaves, then louder, more insistent, as though someone was speaking directly into my ear. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white, and kept driving.\n\nBy mile nine, the shadows along the road had come to life. They shifted and danced at the edge of my vision, some even stepping into the beams of my headlights, revealing twisted, impossible shapes. I couldn’t look at them directly, couldn’t acknowledge them. I just had to keep driving. \n\nMile ten was agony. Every inch of my body screamed to stop, to turn around, to flee. But I pressed on, breathing heavily, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst. The temperature had dropped so low that I could see my breath fogging up in the car. My eyes were drawn to the rearview mirror, but I forced myself not to look. I knew if I did, I’d see something I wouldn’t be able to unsee.\n\nThen, mile eleven. The final stretch. The road began to twist and turn, the trees closing in on both sides. My vision blurred as shapes began to appear in the road ahead—people, or at least what once might have been people. They stared at me with hollow eyes, their faces twisted in silent screams. I pushed the gas pedal to the floor, desperate to escape their gazes. \n\nAnd then... nothing. \n\nThe road simply didn’t end. I passed through what should have been the final stretch, but instead of reaching the end, I found myself on a stretch of road I hadn’t seen before. A mile marker loomed in the dark, barely visible in the weak light of my dying headlights: **Mile 12**.\n\nPanic set in. This wasn’t supposed to happen. There wasn’t supposed to be a 12th mile. The car began to slow, not by my own doing, but as though the road itself was resisting me. I slammed my foot on the gas pedal, but the engine sputtered and died. The whispers returned, louder than ever, almost deafening, drowning out my thoughts. They were no longer just whispers; they were voices, a chorus of overlapping words that twisted into something unintelligible, but undeniably angry.\n\nI stepped out of the car, the cold biting through my clothes, and tried to run. But the road, the darkness, the voices—it all stretched on endlessly. I ran until my legs gave out, but no matter how far I went, the road continued, mile after mile after mile. \n\nMy phone was dead, the lights of my car a distant memory. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The shadows from earlier returned, no longer just at the edges of my vision. They were all around me now, moving closer, their forms more defined, more real. They circled me, their hollow eyes filled with an ancient hunger. \n\nAnd then, I saw it. \n\nIn the distance, something moved on the road. It was indistinct at first, but as it drew closer, I recognized it—**my car**. The engine growled, headlights flickering like the heartbeat of some great, monstrous beast. And in the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel with bloodless hands, was me.\n\nOr at least, what was left of me. My reflection’s eyes were sunken, void of any life, and its mouth was twisted into a grotesque smile. The car stopped inches from where I stood, the engine idling quietly, almost invitingly. \n\nI wanted to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. I wanted to scream, but my throat was raw, as if the very air had been stolen from me. The other me stepped out of the car, its movements jerky, unnatural. It reached out, fingers brushing against my arm, and I felt an icy numbness spread through my body.\n\n“I’ve been waiting,” it whispered, its voice layered with a thousand others.\n\nBefore I could react, it grabbed me, pulling me toward the car, toward that dark, twisted reflection of my own fate. I tried to resist, but I was powerless against its grip. The last thing I saw before everything went black was my own face, grinning back at me with a smile that wasn’t mine.\n\nNow, I’m here. On this road that never ends, forever stuck between miles that shouldn’t exist. My wish? I don’t even remember what it was anymore. All that’s left is the endless journey, the darkness, and the whispers.\n\nThey say the 11 miles will grant you your deepest desire. But if you fail, if you make just one mistake, you’ll find yourself on the 12th mile, forever chasing an end that will never come."},"952":{"title":"Are there any creepypasta that bring back memories of your own child and hit close to home.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1etp3wd\/are_there_any_creepypasta_that_bring_back\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Aqn95","selftext":"Like remind you of an incident from your childhood, like a crazed neighbour, dog, maybe your school, a show you watched or even a place you visited. \n"},"953":{"title":"Original RapRat Puppet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1etnw8l\/original_raprat_puppet\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"BeKe06630","selftext":"A few hours ago today, I was bored and decided to reread the Rap Rat creepypasta.

There are many ethnicities living on our planet and we are all trembling now. All ethnicities are hoping that the attacker is not from their ethnicity. If it is then it will mean bad news for the ethnicities which the attacker comes from. The police are keeping the identity of the stabber hidden for now, but they will eventually tell everyone. The attacker won't get punished but the group of people which he comes from will be attacked. So that's why every ethnicity is terrified. \n\nI am hoping that it's not from community or religion but you never know. The reason I am more frightened than ever, is because a man from my community had come to me because he was hearing voices. The voices were telling him that he needed to chop up his mother and stab her. I helped the young man and I told him that he was in a relationship with the voices. I told him that he didn't have to listen to the voices and that he had a voice himself, and that he should talk with the voices. \n\nSo he talked with the voices which was basically talking with himself. Then it looked like this young man had won when he said to the voices \"I will chop up my mother if you chop up your mother\" and that was a genius move. It's just voices really inside his head and they don't actually exist. So he was happy and he couldn't hear anything as he had put the voices into a corner. \n\nSo it can't be anyone from or ethnicity. Last time someone stabbed someone, it came from the nopon ethnicity. They were nearly wiped out but the nopon stabber had nothing done to him. Then when it came out that the attacker came from my ethnicity, it was that guy who I had helped with dealing with the voices. My people were punished because of what he had done and when I met up with him,  he told me: \"the voices brought a piece of his mother to me\" and I couldn't believe it. He said he found a freshly cut up arm in his room and then he has no choice but to stab up and cut up his mother. \n\nI couldn't believe it and our race is nearly wiped out because of him.

A process which I'll admit sometimes winds up with me missing a few errors on the edit, but now I face the unfortunate  reality of a deadly editor looking over my shoulder and making  sure I write exactly what I'm told, and if I'm not prepared to correct my own mistakes, as well as revising dictation errors on command, what I expect will be my final peice of creative fiction will be quite  literally cut short.\n\nIt all started a few months back when someone I've never met or communicated with decided to go through everything I've ever posted online, and I mean everything, even posts I made anonymously on defunct message boards this person went into detail, YouTube comments, including ones on deleted videos, every comment or meme I've ever posted  to social media, including sites I apparently forgot exist. And I've said a lot of wild and out there stuff, maybe even some stuff that should be the thing to get me in hot water, right? Well, none of it has, even now, it's not anything I said that lead this individual to have me held at knife point at this moment, it's  the way I said it, or more accurately, how poor my spelling can be. Isn't that an inane thing to potentially die for, not even  so much the grammar, it seems to all boil down to me failing to correct a few thousand typos.\n\nIt's not like this is a warning to watch your spelling online because crazy people out there might overreact, because that would assume this kind of thing could happen to just anyone, I mean sure... Why me? I'm not famaos, I'm not widely known, but it seems  there  must be some particular reason I was singled out it the first place for thins maniac to go through my entire online presence, I'm surprised they didn't have all the ingame chats I'd made on Roblox or IMVU, but I guess it's embarrassing enough that they have a list of my accounts, something I like to pretend nobody knows the extent of. Not that I've said anything bad on Roblox, it's just embarrassing that someone has the lists of my accounts on platforms that are known for having many instances of reprehensible behavior reported on them, it's kind of one of those guilty by association kind of things you know? Like am I aware that X,Y, and Z happened on this platform? Yes I am, and yet I choose to engage with it... So what does  that say about  me? I'd like to think nothing.\n\nThe point is this,  I'm about to get stabbed and I can't even build myself up as a character you can sympathize with. I mean it's not like I'm coming up with any of this but a skilled writer should be able to drum up sympathy even using someone else's  words that were intended as an insult, but even if I described to you how I'm sitting here with the point of a knife digging into the small of my back with tears streaming down my face, barely able to read the letters on my cracked cellphone screen through the haze of salty liquid spilling from my eyes, while my cold calculated assailant micromanages every aspect of this post, even then, you still probably wouldn't feel any sympathy for, me, because in so many ways, you and I don't feel the same. And that's  why... That's why it's me instead of any one of you.\n\nI mean I'm sure you've heard of worse things that demand more of your attention than som sixth rate FearFic writer about to get eliminated,  things like Queen Elizabeth taking children away from Canadian schools and them never being seen again,  or maybe you've heard that there are restaurants in Los Angeles that secretly serve human flesh to their elite clientele, if true these things must demand much more of your focus thanwhatever petty squabble is about to lead to the demise of AzothDagger.

Algunos historiadores informan de la existencia de este ser desde los 1800's, mientras que otros dicen que incluso se remonta hasta la caída del Imperio Romano.\n\nEn realidad, nadie sabe a ciencia cierta si este ser en realidad existe o no, hay muchas teorías sobre la gran cantidad de niños y jóvenes desaparecidos misteriosamente alrededor del mundo. Sin embargo, hay factores en común en todas ellas, sin excepción.\n\nSus familiares, amigos y cercanos en general reportaban que estos mismos, meses o incluso días antes de su desaparición, pasaban por momentos muy difíciles, llegando incluso al estado de depresión o estando al borde del suicidio. Problemas intrafamiliares, problemas económicos, bullying, padres ausentes, soledad... Especialmente soledad.\n\nSus padres, hermanos y hasta vecinos decían que por las noches los escuchaban hablando solos... Algo sobre terminar con todos sus problemas y preocupaciones, sobre un supuesto \"renacer\", una nueva vida. Nadie sabía con certeza sobre qué exactamente hablaban, pues cuando entraban al cuarto para averiguar si de verdad estaban hablando con alguien, nada. Estaban solos de vuelta.\n\nNo obstante, siempre quedaban pequeñas manchas rojas en la ventana del cuarto. Sangre de alguno de los desaparecidos anteriores de esa zona.\n\nEn caso de que algún adulto viera lo que sea que estaba junto con el niño, era desaparecido esa misma noche o la siguiente, pero sin dejar rastro alguno.\n\nEsto a veces podía pasar por días, semanas o meses. Sin embargo, el resultado era siempre el mismo sin importar la duración: \"Joven XXXXXX XXXXXXXX se ha reportado como desaparecido\", y, a los pocos días, aparecían rastros de su sangre en alguna otra ventana de ese sector.\n\nDentro de todo esto, había algo peculiar... Los niños siempre cedían mucho más rápido que los adolescentes.\n\nMucho se ha especulado sobre qué puede ocurrirle a dichos jóvenes. Algunas personas creen que son secuestradores y asesinos seriales, otros creen que son los mismos demonios quienes vienen desde las profundidades para llevarse a los jóvenes propensos a pecar y convertirlos en sus lacayos. Mientras tanto, yo tengo mi propia teoría...\n\nHace un año y siete meses, el sobrino de un amigo mío desde la Universidad sufrió de una de estas desapariciones repentinas, teniendo solamente 9 años de edad, siendo también su hermano, Lucas, llevado en el proceso.\n\nEste, el día después de haber logrado ver al ser que estaba junto con su hijo, estaba casi delirando, diciendo que un monstruo trataba de convencer a su hijo de unirse a él en una nueva vida inmortal, prometiéndole que todos sus problemas se solucionarían y no tendría que preocuparse por nada, ni siquiera por pensar porque alguien más lo haría por él, pero que la única condición era entregar su humanidad. Logró obtener toda esta información a base de golpes y gritos hacia su hijo para que le dijera lo que estaba pasando.\n\nTambién le dio a mi amigo una descripción sobre cómo era esa criatura. Dijo que era como un cuerpo humano pero cortado por la mitad y chorreando sangre en el torso. Su parte superior era como si vistiera una chaqueta azul, pero con unas filosas garras negras en vez de manos que se entrecruzaban con la chaqueta, es decir, eso era parte de su cuerpo. No tenía rostro, lo único que era apreciable donde debería ir la cara eran unos ojos blancos brillantes y una sonrisa igual de macabra. Lo curioso es que, pese a estar manchado de sangre, nunca dejaba rastro.\n\nEsa misma noche, pese a intentar irse a otro Estado o hasta salir del país si era posible, tanto Lucas como su hijo desaparecieron sin dejar rastro.\n\nMi teoría es que es un ser perverso que lleva desde los inicios de la humanidad como especie dominante, que se aprovecha de los niños y jóvenes con problemas emocionales en su entorno y los convencen de convertirse en uno de ellos, no importa cuánto le tome, y que actúa como una especie de mente colmena esparcida por todo el planeta. Por eso no importa cuánto te alejes, si viste a este ser, estás condenado.\n\nPero, aquí me surge la duda, ¿Porqué hacen esto? Probablemente para alimentarse de la parte inferior del cuerpo de sus víctimas y aprovechar la agonía de la superior para crear a un nuevo ser como ellos, tan lleno de maldad como tal sea su sufrimiento y deseo de venganza.\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\nSabiendo tanto sobre este ente, se me hace raro que, aún después de tanto tiempo, no se haya decidido a venir por mi. Es posible que no sepa que yo sé de su existencia, pero, al hacer público este documento, habré firmado mi sentencia de muerte. No obstante, no puedo dejar que esto se quede así, el mundo debe saber la verdad.\n\nDespués de todo, deben dejar de creer que sus hijos están hablando con \"su amigo imaginario\".\n\nY recuerda, joven lector, la importancia del cuidado de la salud mental, porque estos seres se te pueden aparecer hasta en el bajón de ánimo más insignificante, llevando a escalar a una situación mucho peor, de la cuál se aprovecharán para convencerte de unírseles. Sin embargo, hagas lo que hagas, no aceptes nada de lo que te digan, ignóralos y procura que nadie más lo vea... No quieres ser un cabo suelto de esta cosa."}}
