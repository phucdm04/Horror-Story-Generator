A year ago, I lived as a paying guest in a house (Kerala)  for about a month, and the experience was so bizarre and unsettling that it changed me in ways I never expected.\n\nFrom the very first day I moved in, strange things started happening. It began with a sensation I couldn\u2019t explain: I would feel a strong slap on my back or chest whenever I tried to sleep in the afternoon. It happened multiple times, and it was like someone was *physically* there, even though I was alone in the room. The worst part was the sleep paralysis. I would wake up, unable to move, and see dark, shadowy figures getting closer to me.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find a young man lying next to me in bed. I could feel his presence beside me\u2014his weight in the bed, but when I turned to look, he was gone. I tried to brush it off, but the experiences kept escalating. There were moments when the electricity in the house would flicker, and sometimes it would short-circuit altogether, leaving me in the dark.\n\nBut the most disturbing thing was that every morning, I would wake up to find a drop of blood coming from my mouth. I had no explanation for it. I felt physically fine when I woke up, but the sight of the blood every single morning was deeply unnerving.\n\nIn addition to all of this, I started experiencing shortness of breath at night. It felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe properly, like something was pressing on my chest. It made sleeping even more difficult and unnerving.\n\nThen came the scariest incident of all. One night, during another episode of sleep paralysis, I saw a dark figure moving closer to me, just like the others I had seen before. Panicking, I reached out, trying to grab something\u2014anything\u2014that would wake me up. But instead of grabbing the bed or the sheets, I grabbed someone's hand. It was cold, and I could feel the fingers tighten around mine. I was frozen, unable to move, and in that moment, I felt like I was connected to something that wasn't human. But when I tried to focus, the hand vanished, and I woke up, heart racing.\n\nThe most unsettling part came about a week later when I found out the young man I had seen in my room had actually lived there before me. He had tragically died in an accident nearby, and he was dearly loved by the family I was staying with. The house, I guess, still held some kind of energy or attachment to him, and I could feel it in every corner of the place.\n\nThe final straw came when my father came to pick me up. On the way, his hand got stuck in the car door, and he lost a significant amount of blood. It felt like everything was connected. Like the bad energy or whatever it was in that house was following me, even outside of it.\n\nAfter all of this, I started changing. I felt like I couldn\u2019t relate to people anymore. I became angry more often and began lashing out at my family members, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I ended up isolating myself, and even now, I sometimes feel like a different person because of what I experienced. I don't know if it was the house, the energy, or just everything combined, but it left me in a place I\u2019ve struggled to get out of.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Or is it just my mind playing tricks on me?"},"1":{"title":null,"url":null,"flair":null,"author":null,"selftext":null},"3":{"title":"L'Ulivo - an Italian Folk Horror","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kkp7p6\/lulivo_an_italian_folk_horror\/","flair":null,"author":"Rocco0700","selftext":"Hey everyone!  \nWe\u2019re developing a\u00a0folk horror\u00a0short film inspired by a local Italian legend, reimagined for today\u2019s world.

Their mother, Lisa, had died three years ago in a car accident, leaving behind a void neither of them could fill. But their grief wasn\u2019t just sorrow\u2014it was guilt. They\u2019d argued with her that morning, telling her she was overbearing, that they needed space. Lisa\u2019s last words to them before she stormed out were,\u00a0*\u201cFine. Let\u2019s see how much you miss me when I\u2019m gone.\u201d*\n\nThis Mother\u2019s Day, Clara and Jake stayed locked in their father\u2019s house, ignoring the world. They didn\u2019t set flowers on her grave or light candles like their father begged them to. They just wanted the day to end.\n\nBut as the sun dipped below the horizon, something changed.\n\nClara was in the kitchen when she noticed the faint scent of Lisa\u2019s favorite lavender perfume. It was subtle at first, but then it grew stronger, filling the air until it became suffocating.\n\n\u201cJake, do you smell that?\u201d Clara called.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jake said from the living room, though his voice trembled. \u201cBut\u2026I think I hear something.\u201d\n\nClara moved closer to him, her heart pounding. The sound was faint at first\u2014a soft, rhythmic tapping, like knuckles rapping against glass. It came from the back door.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d Jake whispered, his face pale.\n\nThe tapping stopped. Then, a woman\u2019s voice, warm and familiar, called softly through the door.\n\n\u201cClara\u2026 Jake\u2026 It\u2019s me, sweethearts. Let me in.\u201d\n\nClara froze, her blood turning cold. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 impossible,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Dad,\u201d Jake stammered, though they both knew it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cPlease, babies,\u201d the voice said, more insistent now. \u201cIt\u2019s Mommy. I just want to see you. I miss you so much.\u201d\n\nClara shook her head, backing away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nJake, tears streaming down his face, called out, \u201cIf it\u2019s really you, prove it!\u201d\n\nThe voice turned soft, almost hurt. \u201cJake\u2026 I know you still sleep with that bear I gave you when you were little. And Clara\u2026 I know you blame yourself for what happened. But it wasn\u2019t your fault, my love. Mommy forgives you.\u201d\n\nThe words hit like a punch to the chest. Clara\u2019s knees buckled, and Jake took a shaky step toward the door.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Clara grabbed him, but the handle began to rattle violently, as if someone were desperately trying to get inside.\n\n\u201cLet me in!\u201d the voice screamed now, all warmth gone. It was guttural, furious. \u201cI\u2019m your mother! You\u2019re my children! You can\u2019t hide from me!\u201d\n\nThe windows around them began to shake, and the scent of lavender turned sickly, like flowers left too long to rot. The tapping on the door turned to pounding, and then to scratching, nails scraping against the wood.\n\n\u201cClara! Jake! Open the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cMom\u2019s dead!\u201d Clara yelled back, tears streaming down her face. \u201cYou\u2019re not her!\u201d\n\nThe pounding stopped.\n\nFor a long, awful moment, there was only silence.\n\nThen, from the other side of the door, the voice said, cold and venomous, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to ignore your mother. Not today.\u201d\n\nThe lights flickered, and the door burst open with a deafening crack. The figure standing there wasn\u2019t their mother\u2014not anymore. It was her decayed corpse, dressed in the clothes she\u2019d been buried in, her once-loving face twisted into a mask of rage.\n\n\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Jake whimpered, backing away.\n\n\u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d she said, her rotting lips curling into a mockery of a smile. \u201cA mother\u2019s love never dies.\u201d\n\nThe last thing the neighbors heard before the house went silent were their screams. When their father returned that night, the house was empty, the door hanging off its hinges, and the faint scent of lavender lingering in the air.\n\nNeither Clara nor Jake was ever seen again\u2014but every Mother\u2019s Day, the neighbors swear they hear faint tapping on their doors and a soft voice whispering,\u00a0*\u201cLet me in.\u201d*"},"8":{"title":"Fishing alone(true story)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kjc201\/fishing_alonetrue_story\/","flair":null,"author":"One-Advance2381","selftext":"One night\/ moring it was 3-4 am on the beach in some grass fishing alone no muisc no cars no birds barley any light I had looked to my right and I saw this human like thing crawl on all yours out the bushes like 20 feet away and craw back I walked over to the same spot during the day no foot prints or even marks in the sand."},"10":{"title":"Sisters (Part 1)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kiov81\/sisters_part_1\/","flair":null,"author":"HelpTheBagMan","selftext":"PART I\u00a0|\u00a0[PART II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kisclx\/sisters_part_ii\/)\u00a0|\u00a0[PART III\u00a0](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kisdkk\/sisters_part_iii\/)| [PART IV](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kisexr\/sisters_part_iv_finale\/)\n\nI left the cult I was involved with a long time ago, however it\u2019s teachings still stay with me always. I have been a member here for quite some time, lurking in the shadows, reading and finding comfort in your experiences as they relate to my own. Even if I have never commented or messaged you personally, I have felt a strong kinship here with you. I have seen many inspiring things on this forum and have decided that now is the time for me to share my own experience, with hope it can inspire others.\n\nBefore I begin, it is important to remember that perception is reality. How you are raised shapes so much of who you are, and the way you view the world. Seeing as this is a forum for people like me, I may not need to explain that. However, I am very used to explaining it to outsiders, and it is a good reminder to us all. You never know what someone else has gone through.\n\nI won\u2019t bore you with my entire childhood, but instead will impart to you the events that led to me leaving my village and brought me here. The events that reshaped my beliefs and made me who I am today.\n\nI am leaving for a trip tomorrow night and will attempt to get everything out to you before I do. If not tonight then tomorrow morning so please be patient if I cannot get through the full story all at once.\n\nBefore I begin, I just want to make clear to you all this simple message.\n\nYou can leave. You can change. You CAN be your best self.\n\nMy name is Vilina, and this is my story.\n\n**Part I**\n\nAs the willows whispered wildly, I passed under and through them. With their many fingers passing over me they brought an already steady girlish giggle to a hearty laugh. I knew that my sisters were not far behind, but as sure as a siren\u2019s call they could always find me from my laughter.\n\nI traveled through the far meadows to the edge of the marsh. I rolled down the ocean of tall grasses and stopped face up at the bank. Looking skyward and feeling the warm winds whip against my cheek, I lounged daydreaming up at the clouds.\n\nMy dreams, much like the rest of my childhood, had always been so calm and comforting. They were so vibrant in their peace and serenity that at times I longed to sleep, to rejoin that other worldly place and its many dreamscapes. I had often thought about it before, and have often since, how fascinating it is that in dreams you do not necessarily see things. It is more a feeling you get from your dream, and your mind simply generates images to match. You get the feeling of falling, or of something chasing you, and that gives you the images of coming closer to earth, or of a monster. Nightmares.\n\nI did not have nightmares. Like most children, other girls in the village did have nightmares. Nightmares were explained to me, but I did not have terrors to call my own. My dreams seemed constantly filled with ethereal places of heavenly, bright vivid visages of wanderlust brought on by a constant sense of tranquility.\n\nI had always dreamed this way, until I didn\u2019t. What\u2019s strange is that in those final weeks in the village my dreams had changed, but at the same time they had not. Where I once dreamed of my wind-swept oceans of tall grasses feeding into mountains and meadows, I now saw only the same things every time I closed my eyes. I saw things I had never seen before. Things that contrasted so harshly to all I had ever known.\n\nIn those dreams I saw cold dark earth packed against red stone walls. I saw a mother who had hair about her face. Mostly, I saw the well. Other images came and went through my dreams in those last few weeks, but the one constant was the well. A well with black brackish waters in a dark place. Always dark. The well with waters that would move up and over you as they slowly transcended upwards out of the well in small beads, sweating from the surface. I remember the feeling that these small perspirations were at the same time calling to me as they were comforting me. They hungered for me to touch them. In every dream I approached the well, but I never touched it or its waters. Whenever I awoke from these dreams, I remember feeling so odd. Not from the dreams themselves, but from the feelings they gave me. These things when said out loud to Mother should have been frightening. So foreign and dark to the only world I had ever known; and yet somehow, I felt the same comfort as I had when traversing my normal temples of trees and green vistas. Maybe for the same reasons I have heard people love to watch wild horses, I loved the well dream. The thing I could not control. The thing I wanted to know more about that always evaded me.\n\nMy mother did not have much to say about these dreams. She merely brushed them off and told me it was a normal part of growing older. We couldn\u2019t always dream of the meadows.\n\nOn that day, as I laid on the beach of the marshland beyond, I slipped again into that same dream, and dreamt as I often had in those weeks. I dreamt of the well, and of its waters calling out to me once more. I approached closer than I ever had before. I willed myself to reach out and touch the bubbly baubles. To  run and to leap into those waters. Yet in my dream, my slow approach never faltered as I drew steadily closer to the well. I felt myself coming to a precipice, about to finally understand what it meant in some way to learn its secrets. I saw my hand climb from my side and stretch out to the surface, coming close to peering over the edge. As I reached the climax of the dream, ready to view the depths of the pool, I felt myself lurch from my slumber once more, its secrets escaping me.\n\n\u201cVilina! Wake up!\u201d\n\nI jolted from the dream. My sister Blanche\u2019s pale face stared down at me with disapproving eyes.\n\nThe wind carried her golden hair across her face, which she primly swept and placed neatly back in order as I sat up.\n\n\u201cAsleep again? Always asleep,\u201d she scolded.\n\n\u201cI was so close! So close to knowing! I could feel it!\u201d I said without veiling my exasperation.\n\n\u201cSo close to nothing,\u201d she chided.\n\n\u201cIts just a dream. We all have the dream. The mothers say we all get them as we get older,\u201d she spoke factually and without condescension.\n\nI knew Blanche did not approve of my many trips through the forests, or of my general curious and lackadaisical habits. However, being perfect as she was, it was not in her to be snide or rude. She had never shared her own feelings on the matter, or of my actions.\n\n\u201cBlanche is right you know,\u201d said Agnes.\n\nI looked to see Agnes staring off towards the marsh with the same look of mistrust and concern she gave most things.\n\n\u201cWe all have the dreams. Mother says even if they terrify us there is nothing to fear,\u201d she continued, her head tilted as she more carefully inspected a frog hopping off into the murk with a little more disgust.\n\nLuckily for Agnes, at that moment we all turned as we heard the beginning of the call. The afternoon beginning of the chapel services, and the melodic hum traveling across the valley to all corners.\n\nBlanche sighed, no doubt anxiously awaiting her eventual visit through those doors and an end to the longing. Longing for the communion with Him she had long been promised. She stared off in the direction of the village, lingering just a second before regaining her composure.\n\n\u201cWe are all too old for this sort of prattle. Any day now we will have our descendance,\u201d said Blanche. \u201cWe will meet Him and see the world beyond. We are far too old to be concerned with dreams and fears. The only thing we need be concerned with is how best to serve Him in all ways and uphold the faith as Mother always says.\u201d\n\nPlacing her hands on her knees, she sat perfectly poised for a moment before softening her face with a smile and looked down to me.\n\nI was amazed at the way she harnessed the ability to preach at us while always maintaining her calm, sweet, motherly demeanor. It was as if she was perpetually practicing the balance, to slip into the perfect motherly role she was destined for. If nothing else could be said, we could all know that Blanche wanted nothing more than to be a mother herself and raise a daughter of her own.\n\nShe saw me staring up at her, pondering the thought while laying lazily in the sand. I\u2019m sure I had a look of indifference to the sermon.\n\nMother or not, she looked at me rolling her eyes as she spoke.\n\n\u201cCome now, lets get back before service finishes to help with the end of day chores.\u201d\n\nStanding, she held out her hand to me.\n\nIt was my turn to roll my eyes as I took her hand and she helped me to my feet.\n\nHer face turned to confusion as our eyes met, and she looked down.\n\nShe turned my hand over and I saw her eyes widen.\n\nI looked down to see what alarmed her, and took in the sight of my own palm. There was dried blood mixed with the sand sticking to a fresh cut.\n\nBefore I could even react, she was dragging me to the waters edge. She began vigorously rinsing my hand in the cold murky waters.\n\nAnges yelped at the sight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t touch the marsh. We don\u2019t touch the marsh. You know that! WE DO NOT TOUCH THE MARSH!\u201d\n\nAnges was working herself into a frenzy.\n\nBlanche\u2019s eyes were wide with panic; however, her voice was still as the waters had been before our interruption.\n\n\u201cWe have to clean it. Maybe, if we clean it there wont be a cut. Maybe you just put your hand in something,\u201d she said.\n\nFrantically she went on waving my hand in the waters.\n\nI already knew she was wrong. I must have gotten the cut while rolling down the bank, but even now I don\u2019t remember feeling when it happened. I do however, remember the sting I felt as the waters of the marsh entered my hand. These were not the tranquil calling waters of the well. These were fresh embers, the burning felt from the cold liquid sent a small prickle up my wrist, and I pulled away from her.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d, she called as I walked back up the bank.\n\n\"The water. The boundaries. You both know the rules. The marsh and the valley apex. It is forbidden. You both know. You know this.\" Agnes was spiraling, dwindling out. She knelt on the ground. She still had not moved an inch closer to the marsh or toward us. Dejectedly she repeatedly whispered as she stared at the ground, \"You know\u2026 You know\u2026\"\n\nThe gash was a couple inches across my palm. Given it had been some time since it happened, with Blanche's cleaning it wasn't even bleeding anymore.\n\n\"Let me see it, I said!\", came Blanche, grasping for my hand once more.\n\nI pulled away again to face her.\n\n\"I am fine. Its fine!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not fine Vilina! You know it\u2019s not fine, the desce\u2026\"\n\n\"IT. IS. FINE!\u201d, I yelled. Taking a breath, I straightened. \u201cYou sound like her.\"\n\nI pointed at Agnes who sat still mumbling, now too low to hear.\n\n\"SHE. IS. RIGHT!\" screamed Blanche emphatically, finally losing the cool poise of the perfect promised child. \"I know she's right, and so do you. We don\u2019t touch the marsh, or go beyond the boundary of the valley's apex. Exiting or going beyond the boundaries before descendance is forbidden. We all know this. You also cannot damage yourself. I only want to help you. We need to find a way to fix this. To hide it if we must.\u201d\n\nThere was a part of me that was touched by her act to help save me. At the same time I thought about how much of that may be self-preservation. We were meant to be three pure sisters descending as a trio, as He wished.\n\nMy eyes narrowed.\n\n\"This is hardly my first scrape, let alone on my hands.\"\n\nI pulled up my skirts to show the pale lines and years of healed damage. My arms were much the same. I had been lucky that my hands had never seemed to be harmed. Added to the fact that injuries were easily concealed in a world where Mothers did not scan over every inch of you. We all wore the white linens from wrist to ankle. People were more inclined to believe you just caught your dress on a snag than you had been injured, so long as you cleaned the fabric well before arriving back home. I had become excellent at cleaning and mending by this point.\n\nThis also wasn't my first time in the marsh. I had spent many a clandestine afternoon wading through the wetlands and sunbathing on the further bank when I knew no one was looking for me. I treasured my stolen afternoons while Blanche devoted more time to housework, and Agnes to fetching up her mother\u2019s skirts. However, I chose not kick that hornet\u2019s nest.\n\n\"I just don't see why He would care at all about a few scrapes over the years, Blanche. Why would He care?\"\n\nBlanche's mouth dropped.\n\n\"We are all meant to come to him as pure as we were born. That is His will. How could you be so careless with all of our futures?\", she said flatly.\n\n\"Because it doesn't matter.\"\n\nYou would think my words had been a knife to her belly.\n\n\"These rules. They are just words. I did worry once, about the first small knick I received. Then nothing happened. As I grew older, I realized no one checks me. No one cares. It does not matter, Blanche.\"\n\nI don't know if she even heard my second reply, as she still seemed to be recovering from the first time I told her it did not matter.\n\n\u201cWhat of the Mother\u2019s cuts? What of their hands? He seems fine with that.\u201d\n\nShe swallowed back whatever disgust she had at my admissions and admonishments.\n\n\"I sincerely hope you're right, Vilina. I hope you don't come to regret this when you meet Him. I hope we all don't come to regret it,\" she said, choosing to ignore my comments about the mothers hands. We all knew not to speak of them.\n\nShe took a breath, and then I saw something change in her for a moment. Something passed the preachy perfect sister I had always known. Her eyes read hurt.\n\n\"I do wish you would have told me. I would have told you.\"\n\nAs quickly as the hurt had shown, it was gone. She dusted off her dress and looked at Agnes. She spoke kind and stern as always, ever the mother again.\n\n\"Come now Agnes, you will be okay. One way or another we must not speak of this. What is done is done. We have not done wrong and have to pray He will know our piety above all when we are weighed and judged by Him. In the end, all are to serve His will, not our own.\"\n\nThis last jab she threw hit home at that moment. She knew it would sting, as those words were not just spoken out of anger. The words were my mother\u2019s words, spoken to me many times through the years. No matter how many times I strayed the path, they had not stopped me from myself. Hearing my mothers own counsel, I wasn't just letting Him down, I was letting Mother down.\n\nBlanche walked up and over the bank holding Agnes\u2019 hand. They headed back through the forest guided by the rising rhythmic hum of His call.\n\nThey were easy words for Blanche to say as an attempt to hurt me, but what did she know? She had never known anything beyond her teachings. She had never felt the call of the wild as I had, never felt the pull from the peaks around us. Blanche had never longed for more than she was allowed. She never hoped for more.\n\nStrengthened in my resolve, I picked myself up and made haste, determined to catch up with my sisters on the path back to the village.\n\nI caught up to them at the foot of the forest that acted as barrier to the meadows. We did not talk of my hand, or of the marsh again.\n\nAs we wound through the path we talked of chores. As always, I found it difficult to focus on turning in the animals, washing, candle lighting, dinner preparation, etc. I did my best to act excited to gather the eggs and clean our chicken coup, though I hated the thought. The hens always pecked at me as I nimbly inspected their nests for eggs. Not to mention the feeling of fear I felt at the thought of running into Stosh. I didn\u2019t have anything that made me feel fear like the other girls did from their dreams, but if I did have nightmares it would surely have been from that rooster.\n\nI shook off the thought, and put on a smile as we weaved through the woods. At last we reached the point of the forest that began to thin, the trees making way for grasses and then nothing but dirt with pink and white pedals.\n\nThe apex of the valley was marked all around us by large flowering dogwood. In the spring each year they started to drop their blossoms. The petals rode the wind to bless us with their spectacle each year, a welcome reminder of just how much I loved home. If the wilds were the waves of my daydreams, then the village was my port. A place to always return, rest, and repeat.\n\nFor some reason the grass and forest refused to overtake the village. I never saw anyone have to clear or remove the woods to make way for new homes, or pens. However, the petals never seemed to care and always blessed us with their beauty. A light dusting always covered the ground through summer, offering a carpet of color to brighten the many dirt pathways and thatched rooftops of the hundreds of small dwellings within the village.\n\nAs we crossed the threshold of the village we saw the other girls already hurrying about their nightly chores. We wound through the homes, and passed by Kori, Reina, and Gabriel. Reina and Blanche had a long standing unspoken feud, the most awkward standoff that I had ever seen. It was a battle for supremacy, to determine who could be more ideal. It was odd, because they did not openly dislike each other.\n\nWe all walked the same path in opposite directions, two sets of three sisters. We met abruptly, staring at one another. We let the two saintly sally\u2019s do the talking.\n\n\u201cBlanche,\u201d said Reina, bobbing her head slowly in acknowledgment.\n\n\u201cReina,\u201d said Blanche, mimicking her to perfection.\n\nThe two prefects stood at attention, mirroring each other in every way down to their golden hair and clasped hands at their navels.\n\n\u201cWe are off to prepare for our Mother\u2019s dinner before we receive His word,\u201d said Reina.\n\n\u201cWe are off to do much the same, except we also plan to bed the animals and get a head start on tomorrows chores. Sorry, we can\u2019t stay to chat. We had better hurry off, mustn\u2019t waste the remainder of the chapel services. As He wills, we look to the future.\u201d\n\nI looked at Blanche with a groan. We never discussed getting a head start on tomorrows work. I for one would not have been in favor, but I did my best to say nothing. I didn't need any more sermons tonight.\n\nBlanche\u2019s comment made Reina\u2019s eye twitch ever so slightly, interrupting the staring contest, and like that it was over.\n\n\u201cMay your descent come soon, and may you all be found worthy,\u201d they both said in unison. The three girls parted way for us, and we walked past them nodding to each other as we did.\n\nI picked up my skirts as Blanche quickened her pace. She strode with her long legs, and the harmony of quick deliberate motion coupled with upright rigidness gave her a weightless quality. Floating, she moved ahead of us with a grace we could not match.\n\nAgnes, seemed always ready for the way that Blanche moved with purpose throughout the village. Trusting Blanche to be her eyes, she kept hers to the ground looking for the imperceivable threats looming to make her take a tumble as she flew.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand that girl,\u201d I breathed, as soon as we turned a corner.\n\n\u201cYou ought not to speak like that about anyone, Vilina,\u201d Blanche said.\n\n\u201cI know you hate her too. All of her comments about hoping we descend soon! She might as well just say she wants to be rid of us already.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nice thing to say,\u201d said Agnes with a sigh.\n\n\u201cI see what she is really saying, and you both know it\u2019s true,\u201d I spat at the ground. I also couldn't afford to look up at this point, with this pace.\n\n\u201cI for one am not trying to say that I hope they descend soon to be rid of her. It is simply the proper thing to say,\u201d said Blanche, as she came to a stop.\n\nAgnes and I almost toppled as we slid to a halt and bumped into one another. Looking up I saw why Blanche had stopped. We were at the point in our route that took us closest to the chapel. I could see the plainly colored white wood boards that made up its walls, otherwise unadorned. My eyes traveled over the great double doors beyond the stairs that Blanche daydreamed of climbing one day. The doors were bathed in a green light, the only such light in all of the village. When I thought about this building I really only had three questions. What made that light green? What was beyond the doors that made the chapel forbidden to girls and not mothers? I pondered the third question, as my eyes raised to look at the chimney above the steepled roof. There was the same steady stream of smoke rising from the chimney that never seemed to cease no matter the time of day or the weather. Blanche turned back to me.\n\n\u201cI am not trying to say that I hope she descends soon to be rid of her,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI do hope she descends soon. Just not before me.\u201d She smiled a smile that touched her eyes before redoubling the mad pace from before.\n\nAgnes and I sighed and took off at a run after her. She may have been able to keep that pace without running or looking foolish, but I am sure Agnes and I looked like idiots.\n\nWe came to our home at last. Without speaking, we all went our separate ways and made for the chores previously discussed.\n\nAgnes broke for the washing, and Blanche for the cooking. I ran straight for the hen pen, but as soon as I was around the back of the house I stopped running and took in a deep breath.\n\nSitting still, tall, and proud was Stosh. With all two feet of his mustered height, the rooster crowed defiantly.\n\n\u201cHis will,\u201d I said with a sigh. I walked forward into battle.\n\nThirty minutes later and a few additional snags in my linens, I returned to the house carrying the nightly round of eggs. I almost dropped the delivery when I saw all three mothers already home.\n\nAgnes sat wide eyed in a chair near Mother Ailsa, who seemed to be speaking slowly to calm her. Blanche was hugging Mother Beatrice. She overflowed with joyful laughter while trying her best to maintain a semblance of grace.\n\nI was confused, until my own mother stood from a chair next to the door. Mother Genevieve looked to me and said what I should have known already.\n\n\u201cMy child, your time has come. Tomorrow will be the day of your descendance.\u201d\n\nI did not react as my sisters did. Agnes responded in fear, Blanche in joy, but I did not know how to feel. I searched my thoughts, and couldn\u2019t determine where I stood between the two. The concept just seemed foreign. Sure, one day I would descend; but that was \u201csome day\u201d. Now that \u201csome day\u201d was tomorrow, I felt torn. Mother Genevieve must have seen the look of consternation. She came to forward, wrapping her arms around me in an embrace. She pulled my head close to her chest, her long stark white hair encasing me.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of you my daughter,\u201d she whispered softly. Her words were a gift just for me. She gently patted my back with one hand, the other stroking my hair delicately.\n\nI pulled back just enough to look up into her wise old eyes.\n\n\u201cI hope I can make you proud tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n\nI meant it. I hoped I would be able to descend. With the reality of the day settling in, I remembered that my fate was not only tied to my sisters, but also to Mother. I was an extension of her, after all.\n\n\u201cYou will. I know you will,\u201d she said with a soft, warm smile.\n\nShe went to hug me again, and as she did I saw past her. I took in the scene of my sisters different emotional states.\n\nBy now, Blanche had moved to comforting Agnes with Mother Ailsa. Mother Beatrice stood with hands on hips, a monument to rigid impatience. She looked in my direction with that same look she had given me my entire life. Unbridled, exasperated contemptuousness lit in her eyes.\n\n\u201cOne of them cries. The other looks like a lost fawn!\u201d, she said throwing her hands in the air. \u201cWe have spent their entire lives preparing them for this moment. You would think there would be more gratitude. In His name. I told you both that you have been to lax with these two. Especially this one,\u201d she said pointing at me.\n\nIt would only serve that the Mother who had raised excellency would have high standards, but Mother Beatrice took this to a different plane. Needless to say as a girl who wasn\u2019t known for following His teachings quite so strictly, I was always a target for a good sermon. Or condemnation.\n\n\u201cWe all handle the descendence in our own way, Beatrice,\u201d said Genevieve.\n\n\u201cThis one hasn't handled anything, ever,\u201d she returned flatly.\n\n\u201cI think she is handling it just fine. We never know when our day will come, or what His will is until He shows us,\u201d my mother said, now turning and giving that same soft smile to Beatrice.\n\nI loved it when she preached lightly back to her. This wasn\u2019t just another set of sisters we watched wrapped in a contended battle of devotion as before. No, this was two titans of divinity.\n\nActing unfazed, Beatrice approached.\n\n\u201cThe trio must serve their purpose as one. If she does not do her part, this will all have been for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will be fine. As will sweet Agnes,\u201d said Genevieve, gracing the timid girl with a nod of approval.\n\n\u201cThey will go. They will descend as He wills, one way or another it will be done,\u201d said Ailsa quietly as she stood. She spread the creases from her linens with far more creased and crevassed fingers.\n\nThis was unlike her. Each mother had a different way of dealing with things. My own mother had a philosophy of fighting Beatrice\u2019s icy demeanor with warmth and an occasional spark of flame. Agnes\u2019 mother chose to handle her with a casual nonchalance, like she did all things. More often then not, just choosing to let her cold stare drill into her uncaring face.\n\nAilsa let out a long, deep breath and walked from the room with a slow tired gait. She made clear she had nothing more to say or add. Her silence carried enough weight of its own.\n\nAgnes looked like a fish out of water. Looking around in dismay, she stood quickly.\n\n\u201cGoodnight sisters. Goodnight mothers,\u201d she said quickly. She almost tripped on her dress as she tried to curtsy while turning to leave in pursuit of her mother.\n\nEven Blanche\u2019s mother seemed stunned to see Ailsa partake in the discussion at all with such finality. However, that shock did not last long. She shook it off quickly and restored her fury to me.\n\n\u201cShe better make it Genevieve. Blanche deserves better,\u201d she fumed. She called for Blanche to accompany her, and stormed off.\n\nBlanche hurried to follow, but not before giving me an apologetic look.\n\n\u201cGoodnight Sister. Goodnight Mother Genevieve. Thank you for all you have done for me. For all of us,\u201d she said. I could tell she was still overjoyed and despite the heated exchange she still couldn't set aside her own excitement for the next days events.\n\nShe curtsied her respect, and quickly padded off to follow her mother.\n\nWe took our leave then, and as usual Mother walked me to my room. Like every other night, as I prepared my night clothes she sat at the edge of my bed humming quietly. Mother closed her eyes as she swayed there to that melody. It was as though she drifted off in her own special place. It is a memory I still take with me always. Something to comfort me to sleep each night, even now.\n\n\u201cAre you nervous my child?\u201d, she asked as I slipped into bed.\n\n\u201cI am. I just want to satisfy Him.\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cYou will Vilina. You will. I have faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will happen tomorrow, Mother?\u201d, I asked.\n\nShe paused looking down at me as her lips pulled to a line. She looked even older than usual. It was as if the smile vanishing on my kindly mothers face was a sign that all of the exuberance she had left had been depleted, leaving a husk of the sweet fruit she had been.\n\n\u201cYou know I cannot tell you that,\u201d she said. Her tender look and smile returned, but it seemed to take some effort or unknown toll from her.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t know what to do? What happens if I make a mess of things? I don\u2019t want to ruin things, or to disappoint you.\u201d\n\nShe maintained her patient kindness, but I could tell somewhere behind that smile something was troubling her. She chewed my words. Nodding to herself she seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\u201cMy daughter, my Lamb. I must confess that no other Mother has ever truly loved a daughter as I do so love you, my child.\u201d\n\nShe paused a moment. Her eyes took me in, and then looked about the room as if to just take in the moment. Seeing no one else, she took a deep breath and whispered to me. She spoke in a rush, in a tone that not even the walls were meant to hear.\n\n\u201cBecause of the depth of my love for you Vilina, I must tell you something. Something that I should not.\u201d\n\nMy head cocked to the side, but before I could speak, Mother Genevieve leaned in closely. Even though she was whispering directly into my ear, her voice was so hushed I thought even the light wind outside would surely take the words away.\n\n\u201cIn the most difficult moments.\n\nTake heed my words.\n\nGive in completely.\n\nHave faith forever my child.\u201d\n\nShe pushed out each line quickly like a spear which attacked my mind the moment it left her and entered me. As quickly as the conspiratorial possession overtook her, it seemed to pass as she pulled away and stood. She once again spoke busily of mundane nightly duties.\n\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d, she said.\n\nI was still reeling trying to understand.\n\n\u201cI shall fetch you something small before bed.\u201d\n\nShe walked out of the room. I was left in the vacuum created in the wake of her words, words that ran rampant through my head. Spinning, I replayed every line.\n\n\u201cIn the most difficult moments.\n\nTake heed my words.\n\nGive in completely.\n\nHave faith forever my child.\u201d\n\nWhat made this odd was that there was nothing out of the ordinary in anything she said.\n\nNothing made sense, because it all made too much sense. She had told me these things almost daily for my entire life.\n\nI had always been a wanderer. It was difficult for me to fall in line. Difficult to conform to the dresses, chores, routines, and rituals that all the other girls seemed to have no issue adhering to. Because of this, Mother had often told me to heed her words, to give in to Him, be forever in faith, and to follow His will. She had even said this in front of my sisters and the other mothers many, many times. These things were openly taught; not just to me, but to all of us during the many seasons of life.\n\nWe were always meant to have faith in His teachings, even though as girls we did not yet know Him. Every girl in the village knew that during difficult winters, pain, or any hardship, our mothers faith was strong. We never lost faith in them, and our mothers never lost faith in Him.\n\nWhy would she say such a thing, and in such a way? The question plagued me.\n\nShe returned to my bed with a small portion of bread and cheese. Handing it to me I could tell that she knew I was vexed. However, along with all other great conspirators, we held a commonality. The unspoken trust that what had been said, had been said quietly and in such a way as to never be mentioned again.\n\nShe sat humming a version of the call at the edge of my bed while I ate. It was my turn to take in that moment now. Seeing her there, I ate slowly. I hoped she would say something else to make it all make sense, but in the end I finished my plate and handed it back to her. She stood, kissed my forehead, and smiled at me one last time before leaving the room without another word.\n\nI laid awake mulling the meaning of Mothers words repeatedly until His real nightly call came crashing through the village. The low thrum of the tone reverberated in the small space. The walls shook and my bed pulsed as it lulled me to sleep. In my slumber I floated off to be filled with more dark, moist memories."},"12":{"title":"Crying people","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kiet6g\/crying_people\/","flair":null,"author":"GloomyIndependent736","selftext":"So basically a few months ago me and my friends were outside, we were in our home town Biha\u0107 in Bosnia and we were kinda bored but we heard about a haunted house in another town over so us being the smart guys we are decided to go, since it was known that immigrants used to sleep in that exact house we brought bats and crowbars with us just for extra saftey measures. We finally arrived but the moment we laid eyes on that house we felt chills go down our spines, we started at the graffiti ridden house with awe. We stayed silent outside while smoking to see if its true that there are noises coming from the house after a few minutes nothing was heard, just when we taught it was all bs we started to go in. The moment i laid my foot at the enterance of the house i heard a step inside on the rusted wood. Now i thought i was tripping and it was just the stories getting to me, suddenly again we all heard a step. Our legs got a bit shaky but we decided to stick through and go in, once inside the house it was creepy as fuck and we just decided to explore. Me and my friend went upstairs together while the 3rd guy stayed the floor under. So us 2 started fucking around and yelling but the moment we went silent we heard a woman and man crying from the other room, cold sweats got the both us and we started running away back to the car while the crying multiplied. We got back to our city in 30 minutes while it took us an hour and a half to get there\u2026"},"13":{"title":"Match Box","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kid15x\/match_box\/","flair":null,"author":"bruhmoment694207","selftext":"Part 1: No Surprises\n\nWhen my father passed, it was no surprise that I would inherit everything he had to be left behind. In his last years he became a recluse. Hoarding his old books, letters he wrote, old junk furniture, and even some money he didn\u2019t care to spend. His house was noted as, \u201cone match away from hell on Earth.\u201d so, I wasn\u2019t jumping on the chance to collect my winnings and head home. I also had to wait for the press to die down so I wouldn\u2019t be caught snooping through the old man\u2019s unmentionables. My father was an illustrator for a long running series of horror novels. Admittedly, the stories didn\u2019t have much to say, but the illustrations\u2026 they always had the ability to catch most people\u2019s eye. He ended up with more fame than he wanted, or could handle, but I always respected how he protected me from the press. Until his death, most people didn\u2019t know he had a son, or a wife that died in childbirth, or even a crippling drug addiction that caused his brain to melt like ice cream.\n\n\tMost people loved what he drew. Dark, cripplingly depressing. And others, like myself, hated what they saw, yet couldn\u2019t look away. Like a car crashed into an animal shelter that had visiting orphans. I remember lying awake at night, the sight of \u201cThe Angel\u201d hovering in the sky burning into my brain and almost forcing itself to appear on my ceiling. He had the ability to create what should be a beautiful, hopeful thing, and turn it into a monolith of everything you had feared, becoming a reality. An angel appears in the sky to the cheers of sinful humans ready for salvation, not knowing that they haven\u2019t even come close to heaven. That\u2019s what he would capture, and that\u2019s what they would form lines for. I never had an artistic knack, but I wouldn\u2019t say his skills could be genetic. Maybe he could\u2019ve taught me by letting me smoke from his pipe and let my mind create horrors of unimaginable dread.\u00a0\n\n\tAnyway, once I knew I wouldn\u2019t be harassed I finally made my way to his home. A dreary, and dim day. Highlighted by the soft rainfall falling onto my underprepared thin t-shirt and shorts. Not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it to be a rainy day, I could light that bitch up from one wrong lamp. Opening the front door, I could feel a stack of boxes holding me back, imaging him hearing one small step on the porch and immediately sheltering in with a shotgun aimed at the door. Once I pushed the barricade out of my way, I could see just how right I was in my assumptions. Across from the entrance was his one recliner chair with a dangerously loaded gun next to it. Same one he bought for my birthday. Looking at the seat I saw a torn piece of paper, when I turned it over I saw my father\u2019s exact fears. \u201cThe Rainmen\u201d being one of his last works wasn\u2019t lost on me. A group of men, drenched from the hazardous rain of the outside world. Their suits slowly burned away as if the rain was acidic itself. Dangerous men after an old drug addict on his last leg, knowing this was the end, yet still drawing it out all through his demented perspective.\u00a0\n\n\tHe definitely never lost his touch.\u00a0\n\nA creeping walk through a desolate memory lane brought me to a bleak understanding of who my father had become. Old rooms that used to mean something, cramped by boxes of unintelligible writings alongside horrific illustrations. Like I said, the stories never matched the artstyle. My old room became a fortress of his best-selling books. His best creations all lined up and stored away in a room he actually kept pretty neat\u2026 all things considered. Maybe under all of the mess his brain became he still had a little bit of him left. Actually, made me feel better about everything that had happened. Until I remembered this was all mine now, and all mine to clean up. I\u2019ll definitely be sleeping at a cheap motel for the near to distant future. Hopefully I haven\u2019t been caught in town, or else the fanfare will find me and that I just cannot take that right now.\n\n"},"14":{"title":"I\u2019m a Night Janitor. One of My Buildings Isn\u2019t Like the Others.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1ki3og7\/im_a_night_janitor_one_of_my_buildings_isnt_like\/","flair":null,"author":"TebaoftheGale","selftext":"You pick up a few things when you clean buildings at night.\n\nLike which vending machines are always half-jammed, or which elevators get stuck on their way to the top floor. You learn the smell of copy toner before it runs out. You learn that most security cameras don\u2019t even work. You learn which places whisper back when you\u2019re alone.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing janitorial work since I was eighteen. I\u2019m twenty-six now. Never went to college, didn\u2019t see the point. Cleaning payed okay, and I like being alone. My route covers half a dozen places: a dental office, a bank, a small corporate law firm, an empty department store that\u2019s half renovation dust, half ghosts of Christmas displays. I work nights because I don\u2019t like people. It\u2019s quiet. Just me, the mop, and my thoughts.\n\nThat is, until that building was added to my route.\n\nThe contractor didn\u2019t say much about it when I got the assignment. Just a little grunt and a \u201cKeep your head down.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get the name of the business inside, just the address and a set of keys. 618 Drexler Street. You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at it\u2014a windowless concrete rectangle, maybe four stories tall. No signs, no logos, no parking lot. Just a single metal door with a keypad and a swipe lock. The keycard worked on my first try.\n\nInside, it smelled like something that had never breathed air. That sort of sealed smell, like old freezer burn and wet electronics. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, that distinct hum-buzz. Everything felt... sterile. But not in the clean way. More like something trying too hard to be clean.\n\nThe first night, I assumed it was a research lab or something government-adjacent. Rooms with bolted-down tables, drains in the floor, some that had chairs with shackles. That should have been my first red flag. But I\u2019m not paid to ask questions. I wiped things down, emptied some bins (filled with shredded paper that felt oddly warm), mopped the halls, then clocked out and left.\n\nThe second night, I noticed the layout felt off. Like a hallway I could swear wasn\u2019t there the night before. Or a door that opened into a bricked-off wall. I blamed the exhaustion. Or maybe the place was one of those modular research things with shifting sections. Right?\n\nI started keeping track. Sketched a rough map on a notepad in my car. It never matched the next night\u2019s layout. Doors moved. Sometimes walls did, too. And then the noises started.\n\nNot loud noises. Not at first. Just a low, almost subsonic hum. Like an old fridge running in the next room, but deeper. There were clicks too. Rhythmic. Almost like speech, but in a language made of teeth.\n\nI told myself it was the HVAC.\n\nBut one night, I heard it behind a door I hadn\u2019t noticed before. No label. No handle, just a slot at waist level and a reader that blinked red when I got close. And from the other side, something scraped the floor.\n\nSomething wet.\n\nI didn\u2019t open it. I don\u2019t even think I could have. But I swear that slot blinked at me when I passed.\n\nThen I started seeing it.\n\nFirst just a shadow at the end of the hallway. Tall. Unnaturally thin. Almost the shape of a person, but stretched out\u2014like someone had dragged a human being down to the size of thread and told them to stand up again. I\u2019d catch it for a split second before it disappeared behind a corner. Never any footsteps. Just the faintest hiss, like something breathing through slits in its throat.\n\nOne night, I looked into one of the observation windows. The room was empty. Then the lights flickered.\n\nAnd there it was, in the reflection.\n\nBehind me.\n\nIt didn\u2019t move, just stood there, head tilted, limbs twitching like it was unsure how to hold itself up. I turned around. Nothing. But the window still showed it standing there.\n\nWatching.\n\nThat\u2019s when I stopped sleeping properly. And that\u2019s when I noticed it started following me home.\n\nThe smell came first. That wet-electronics scent, even in my truck, even in my apartment. Then the low hum, coming from nowhere. And then, once\u2014I saw my hallway get longer. While I was walking through it.\n\nI asked my boss to drop the building. Said it gave me the creeps. He just laughed. Said that account paid too well.\n\n> \u201cPlace has been through three janitors this year,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing better than most.\u201d\n\n\n\nBetter than most?\n\nI should\u2019ve quit.\n\nLast week, I tried bringing my phone in. Wanted to record something. Anything.\n\nFootage came out blank. Audio was worse\u2014just a garbled mess of static and what sounded like sobbing run through a blender. Then the phone wouldn\u2019t turn off. It started showing images. Not ones I took.\n\nOne was of me.\n\nSleeping.\n\nFrom the foot of my bed.\n\nLast night was the worst. I got lost. Inside the building. That map in my notebook? Useless. Halls looped. Elevators only went down. I passed the same fire extinguisher five times\u2014except each time, it was dripping more. First rust, then something black, then something moving.\n\nThe lights died. My flashlight flickered like it was breathing. I felt it behind me again.\n\nNo footsteps.\n\nJust heat. A boiling, pulsing heat, and the sharp scent of blood and ozone.\n\nI ran.\n\nI don\u2019t remember how I got out. I remember a stairwell that should\u2019ve ended at the third floor, but I ran down twenty-five flights. I remember doors that opened into blackness filled with stars, where gravity felt sideways. I remember whispering in my ear. In my own voice.\n\nIt said, \u201cYou\u2019re clean enough now.\u201d\n\nI woke up in my truck.\n\nWith bloody footprints leading out of the building.\n\nI\u2019m not going back. I don\u2019t care if I get fired. I tried to report the building to the city. They said Drexler Street doesn\u2019t exist. I drove there during the day\u2014it was a goddamn parking lot. Cracked concrete.

This story is about my great aunty and it happened roughly 40 years ago in the countryside of Northern Ireland.\n\nMy great aunty was a strange lady and had always been involved with witchcraft. My dad had told me they were banned from entering any other rooms in my great aunties house apart from the living room, lets just shortly put it she was a strange lady. One night, my grandfather was out in his field very late at night herding cattle, when he suddenly saw my great aunty, frolocking and dancing in the field, wearing a beautiful white wedding dress and a full ballroom like outfit. My grandfather, extremely confused and startled, approached her. However, he looked back for a quick second to check on his son, (my dad), and when he turned back she was gone. Completely erased, with no trace of her at all, not even footprints. He then, naturally, went to her house. But when he checked her house, she found her. Dead, rotting away in the bathtub. He phoned the ambulance and he later received the information from the autopsy that **she had been lying in the bath dead for two whole weeks before he saw her dancing in the field...** My grand father was deeply moved by this and decided to demolish the witchcraft-ridden, cursed house my great-aunty lived in. When he sadly passed away in 2003, my dad inherited the land and decided to rebuild on it. Whilst  in construction, the building collapsed, crushing a construction worker and sending her into a 5 month coma. Furthermore, 3 months later, on that exact road, a trailer detached from its car, hitting two innocent civilians and nearly killing them both.

In the kitchen, under the clink of dishes. In the bathroom, beneath the hum of the fan. Even in bed, when the world should have been silent\u2014it was there. Constant. Persistent.\n\nTick.\n\nI asked my neighbor if he heard it. He laughed and said I needed to relax. Maybe I did. I hadn\u2019t slept much since Ellen left. The house felt too big without her. Her toothbrush still in the cup. Her scent still on the pillows.\n\nMaybe it was stress. Maybe it was grief.\n\nTick.\n\nI ripped the house apart. Every clock, every watch, every possible source\u2014I smashed them. I shut off the power. I sat in the middle of the dark living room, breath held, ears straining.\n\nTick.\n\nCloser now. Not from the wall. From inside.\n\nI thought: Maybe I\u2019m going mad.\n\nThat was when I saw the shadow. Not in the corner of my eye\u2014no, bold and standing, watching me from the hallway. Tall. Still. Its head tilted like it was listening too.\n\nI didn\u2019t move. Neither did it.\n\nI blinked, and it was gone.\n\nThe doctor gave me pills. \u201cStress-induced auditory hallucinations,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping, you\u2019re isolated.

Dozens of clocks lined the walls, from ornate grandfather clocks to tiny pocket watches, each singing its own rhythm of time\u2019s passing. But none of them mattered now.\n\nHe had once loved time. He had measured it, respected it, worshiped it like a god he could almost touch. After fifty years of crafting and mending, his hands grown calloused and mind sharpened like a pendulum\u2019s swing, he did the impossible\u2014he built a device that could breach time\u2019s veil.\n\nIt looked so simple. A brass dial, a humming coil, a switch that glowed faintly blue. He had called it The Gentle Hour. The first time he used it, he wept. He stood in his boyhood home and watched his mother sing. He blinked, and he was in the war, young again, terrified. Another blink, and he saw the moment he first opened his shop.\n\nBut something went wrong.\n\nHe can\u2019t remember the moment of the explosion\u2014only the deafening ring, the smell of scorched copper, and a flash of white. He had torn time, but instead of moving through it, he had become trapped within a single hour. Forever 3:17 p.m., October 11th. Leaves always falling. The same wind always brushing past his window. The same knock on the door he never answers, because he knows who it is\u2014himself.\n\nEvery day, he watches his past self reach for the device. Every day, he tries to stop it, screaming, breaking clocks, smashing glass\u2014but the loop resets before anything changes. The world returns. The tick begins again.\n\nHe does not age. He does not sleep. Time wraps around him like a noose that never tightens. He has torn pages from books, carved symbols into walls, tried fire, drowning, silence. Nothing sticks. He wakes up every cycle in the same chair, with the same cup of cold tea beside him.\n\nAnd worst of all\u2014he remembers. Perfectly. Every second. Every repetition. He is a man trapped in amber, fully conscious, fully aware, endlessly circling the moment he ruined everything.\n\nOnce, he thought he could fix it. He rewired the machine a thousand times, adjusted gears, changed settings, replaced crystals. But the loop only laughed. It played him like a melody on repeat.\n\nHe has seen madness. He has begged time itself. He has cursed gods, built shrines, torn them down. The clocks mock him now, all striking different hours\u2014none of them real.\n\nSometimes, he wonders if this is penance. For tampering with what should never be touched. For daring to believe he could master time, when he was only ever its servant.\n\nNow he waits for something\u2014he no longer knows what. A crack in the loop. A merciful error. An end.\n\nBut the hour hand never moves.\n\nAnd in the quiet cottage, among ticking ghosts, the clockmaker remains. A prisoner of his own design.

The blow stunned him for a moment, but he didn\u2019t stop. He knew that if he stood still, *something* would catch him. The worst part was that he didn\u2019t know what that something was.\n\nMart\u00ednez didn\u2019t move like a person. And he didn\u2019t seem insane. It was as if his muscles were being pulled by invisible strings.\n\nAs he ran, the radio\u2019s hum didn\u2019t fade. On the contrary\u2014it was everywhere. It vibrated in the glass panes. It trembled in the walls. Even his body seemed to resonate with it. A low pulse, like a distant drum getting closer.\n\nLucas reached the security room. He shut the door and turned the bolt. Stumbling to the console, he tried to contact someone through the general radio.\n\n\u2014\"This is Base San Ciro... There\u2019s an incident! I need reinforcements now!\"\n\nOnly static.\n\nThe hum changed again.\n\nNow it was deeper. Almost like a guttural, robotic chant\u2014barely audible, yet it made his teeth ache. Lucas covered his ears, but it was useless. The frequency was everywhere. *Inside* him.\n\n\u2014\"Shut up, shut up, shut up!\" he screamed, slamming his fists against the console.\n\nThen Camera 2\u2019s screen flickered.\n\nIt came back on.\n\nLucas stared.\n\nMart\u00ednez was standing in front of the security door. Still. Motionless. Staring directly into the camera lens.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBehind him, in the blurry edges of the screen, more figures could be seen. People who shouldn\u2019t be there. Three... no, five. One wore a maintenance uniform. Another, a grease-stained coverall. All standing. All still.\n\nAll vibrating to the rhythm of the hum.\n\nLucas collapsed into the chair, hyperventilating. Logic no longer applied. None of this made sense. He checked each monitor one by one. They all showed the same thing: figures that didn\u2019t move\u2026 until they *did*. In unison. Without emotion. Like pieces of a macabre symphony.\n\nAnd suddenly, a voice.\n\nNot from the radio\u2014but inside his head.\n\n*\"Tune in with us...\"*\n\nLucas screamed, clutching his temples tightly. He fell to the ground. The hum intensified, as if every atom of the air began to vibrate with it.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he didn\u2019t know how much time had passed.\n\nThe screen was black.\n\nThe radio, off.\n\nSilence was absolute.\n\nAnd then, without warning, someone slammed on the door. Once. Twice.\n\nThen, in a dry, distorted voice that could not belong to anything alive, he heard from the other side:\n\n\u2014\"Lucas... open the door.\"\n\nThe knock was so sharp and precise that Lucas thought the hinges would give way. Then another. And another. Each impact more violent, as if whatever was on the other side had forgotten how to use hands and now just threw its entire body against the door.\n\n\u2014\"Lucas... open the door...\" the voice repeated, distorted, like dragged through a rusted cable.\n\nLucas crawled to the farthest corner of the room, trembling, his fingernails digging into the floor as if that could anchor him to reality. Sweat poured down his forehead, mixed with tears he hadn\u2019t even realized he was shedding.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nOne of the hinges gave way. A piece of metal flew off and embedded itself in the wall like a dagger.\n\nThen came the stench.\n\nRot.\n\nNot the smell of someone recently dead, but of bodies fermenting from the inside. Flesh reheated from the bones by some unnatural energy\u2014a combustion that didn\u2019t create fire, only active decay.\n\nThe door burst open.\n\nAnd he saw him.\n\nMart\u00ednez no longer had a face.\n\nThe skin of his skull had slid off like melted wax. One eye dangled loosely, still faintly pulsing, held by a stretched and grimy nerve. His mouth hung open, but his tongue writhed like a severed worm. Black blood bubbled from his nose and ears.\n\nBeside him, another worker\u2014one of the station\u2019s technicians\u2014stumbled in with his torso split open. His intestines, blackened and dry, hung like disconnected cables. He walked on a broken ankle, the bone protruding outward with each step.\n\nAnd both of them moved to the rhythm of the hum.\n\nLucas screamed. Not like a man\u2014but like a cornered animal.\n\nHe ran for the back hallway, bumping into furniture, slipping on his own vomit. Behind him, the uneven, wet footsteps echoed like a grotesque march.\n\nHe reached the maintenance workshop.\n\nHe grabbed a tool at random\u2014a rusted crowbar. He didn\u2019t think. He didn\u2019t reason. When one of the bodies reached him and tried to grab him with fingers that felt like wire, he struck its head with all his strength.\n\n*CRUNCH!*\n\nThe skull split like an overripe melon.\n\nA thick jet of blood, black as tar, sprayed out, coating his face and chest. The body dropped to its knees but didn\u2019t stop. It kept reaching for him\u2014jawless now\u2014with a sharp gurgle that was anything but human.\n\nLucas screamed again and hit it.\n\nOnce. Twice. Three more times.\n\nUntil only a pulverized skull and a mess of unrecognizable flesh remained. But the radio on his belt was still humming. Even though he hadn\u2019t turned it on.\n\nThe hum. And then a familiar voice.\n\n\u2014\"You\u2019re waking up, Lucas.\"\n\nHis hand trembled. His clothes were soaked. He didn\u2019t know if it was someone else\u2019s blood or his own. He didn\u2019t know if he was still alive.\n\nOr if he still had a choice."},"22":{"title":"Boxes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kfambo\/boxes\/","flair":null,"author":"LewGlaze","selftext":"My family was like a drop of water in an endless river. We moved from place to place, house to house, so quickly that I didn't even have time to unpack. When we moved to Cornwall only then, the boxes became an issue.\n\n\n\nThis was the first time in months that I was able to unpack in a house. We had decided to stay there until my father found a job elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOnce we had arrived, I was drawn to a room at the centre of the house. This room was a large open space with only a wardrobe, which was the size of my bathroom, and a bed. The rest of the room was a barren waste. The boxes were placed in a pile in the centre of the room. Over the time that I spent in that house I sifted through box after box, it felt like hundreds, maybe thousands. The first day I arrived I looked in the first one ready to unpack and sleep. This box contained a pillow, blanket and a dirty rag. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I said, picking up and sniffing the rag. It had a strange red substance coating a corner of it and it smelled like death.  \u201cEw\u201d I threw it on the ground and got into my bed. In the night I woke up and heard a rustling noise in the centre of the pile, I looked in and saw nothing. I didn't think anything of it and climbed back into bed, resting until morning.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I searched many more boxes for items to fill the empty space in my room. My parents helped me for some, but left after they heard my little sister, Anne crying loudly. She was crying for attention. These boxes all carried mundane things and only one contained anything of interest. A bone. A small and dry bone, my parents never noticed me grab it. I looked at it with a strange sense of fear. The bone was small yet big enough that it could be seen as a finger. I slid it into a drawer and didn't look at it again. Later that night I heard the rustling of boxes in the wardrobe so I decided to deal with it in the morning.\n\n\n\nOn the third day, Anne said she would help me search the boxes. I knew she was just searching for her stuff. Yet, I accepted the help reluctantly after my mother shot me a look of danger. After an hour of box after box after box I got bored of the endless purgatory of my room. As I left to see my parents my sister said she wanted to see inside the wardrobe. \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d I Said shortly. After coming back from my break, Anne was nowhere to be seen. I had guessed she got bored and left too. The pile of boxes had not changed since I left it and I cursed at Anne under my breath. The wardrobe was closed and I heard no noises from it all that night.\n\n\n\nOn the fourth day, the number of boxes was dwindling so my mother came to help me. As we both emptied boxes and talked I saw another bone, this one larger, a skull of a young person. I thought it was a statue of some sort so I put it in the drawer with the other bone. She finished half of the boxes and told me that she would tackle the wardrobe next. She also told me to take a break because I had worked so hard. I gladly got out of that room and allowed my mother to go into the wardrobe. I decided to look and play with Anne but she seemed to have disappeared from her room, maybe she went out with my dad to his temporary job. He had to work away for a few weeks so I let myself relax in the living room. Once I got back to my room, my mother was gone. It was getting late so I decided to get some rest. I didn't know where she was but I didn't worry. That night I heard a voice coming from the wardrobe. It growled, \u201d we are famished, we need food, we need you.\u201d I grabbed my phone, put the light on and opened the door. It hit my nose first, it was like rotting flesh and feces combined, the sight that it showed made me want to die. It was a pit, I couldn't see the bottom of it. The black mass seemed to entice me. I fell, and I kept falling. Suddenly I felt a thud, I had hit a bottom. All around me is an endless expanse of darkness. I can see shapes moving in the absence of light. They are whispering. I'm writing this on my phone now. If you're seeing this I'm most likely dead, please somehow tell my dad not to check the boxes.\n\n\n\nOr he might find my bones next.

It was the 4th quarter of what would be my final game, the score was 70-68 and we were in the final stretch. I was on fire and was preparing to secure the win with seconds on the clock. An opposing player lost his balance while I was going for my shot and pushed me out of the air. I could still hear and feel the excruciating pain as I fell face-first and my legs bent at angles they weren't meant for.\n\nNow, almost twenty years later, I find myself bouncing from job after job, not being able to hold anything down, as the permanent injuries made most work almost impossible.

He sounded like he was in his mid to late-50s, his voice carried an almost \\*empty\\* tone, like whoever was on the line had been stripped of his will to live.\n\n\"Yes, hello. My name is Daniel Moore, I'm calling about the ad you had posted online, is the position still open?\"\n\n\"Oh, pleasure to speak to you, Mr. Moore.

My name is Mr. Haslow, I am the hiring manager at \\[Redacted\\].\"\n\nr\"Nice to meet you, Mr. Haslow.\"\n\n\"Before we give you the job, I'll need to ask a few routine questions to see if you're fit for the job. Is that alright with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, ask away.\"\n\n\"First, are you physically capable of performing all the listed duties and any extra duties you will be provided with?\"\n\nI paused for a moment, unsure if I should lie and not mention my injury. This job could be life-changing, so i decided to lie.\n\n\"Yes, I am more than capable.\"\n\n\"Good good. Tell me, are you scared of the dark?\"\n\nI was a little taken aback by Mr. Haslows' question.\n\n\"Scared of the \\*dark\\*...? N-no not really.\"\n\n\"Very good. Tell me, how do you handle high-stress situations?\"\n\n\"Well enough, I can manage pretty much anything you throw at me.\"\n\n\"Good. Mr. Moore, we think you'd be a great fit and want you to work with us. Your introduction starts tomorrow night at 7:30pm. Don't be late.\"\n\nBefore I could ask any questions, the line was disconnected. At the time, I didn't care all that much, I was just offered a decent amount of money and that was all I could think about.\n\nTomorrow night rolls around, and I approach the building as instructed. The office was surprisingly tall and slender, reaching 15 stories but only about 300ft wide. The outside was decorated in beautiful golden lights that covered the quartz pillars stretching near the top. The bottom level featured a lapiz blue walkway with small gardens on either side. As I approached the main entrance, I couldn't help but notice a light, almost \\*metallic\\* smell coming from just beyond the doors. I was greeted by a rather tall and slender man dressed in a brown suit with slacks and a small blue bowtie. He had slicked-back hair, a sunken expression that looked as though he hadn't slept in weeks. Piercing blue eyes that seemed to almost look \\*through you\\* rather than at you. He had unusually pale skin, as if all the blood had been drained from him. He cracked a smile that revealed a set of perfect pearly whites. For a second, I thought I had seen more canines than a person should have\n\nAt the time, I didn't notice it, but something seemed almost \\*off\\* about his appearance, eyes a little too blue and sunken. A smile that seemed to invite more than just my presence. A stature and height that didn't make any natural sense.\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you in person, Mr. Moore.\"\n\n\"You must be Mr. Haslow? Pleasure to meet you too.\"\n\nHis voice didn't sound as empty as it seemed over the phone, it felt almost \\*relaxing\\*, like all the tension that was built up had faded away.\n\n\"Thank you for arriving at the specified time, allow me to show you around the ground floor and bring you to your supply room.\"\n\nAs we stepped into the building, I felt a weird sensation cover my body. A sense of dread, all the hairs on my body stood up and my mind started sending me warning signs to leave this place immediately.\n\n\"Is something the matter, Mr. Moore?\"Mr. Haslow responded, as if he could sense my body's reaction.\n\nFor some reason, all the panic signs left my mind and body the moment he spoke.\n\n\"N-nothing, Sir.\"\n\nAs we continued through the ground floor, I was able to observe and take in all the unique architecture the building offered. The walls were covered in red fabric, something akin to Chinese interiors. There were small pillars across the walls, some were marble, others were made from jade, and others from quartz, similar to the outside. On each pillar stood a bronze statue depicting some mythological entity. I recognized some of themself. Medusa, the Hydra, Cerberus, and even a statue of the Buddha. I didn't bother asking about the design choice.\n\n\"Here is your janitorial closet, in it you will find all of your cleaning supplies, and a list of your duties. I expect excellence from you, Mr. Moore. Do not disappoint me. Also, if anything strange happens, don't be afraid to give me a call. I've seen it all, I'll walk you through it.\"\n\nWith that, Mr, Haslow left and It was just me and my supplies. I was nearly done changing into my uniform when a crumpled-up paper fell from my pocket and onto the floor. I picked it up, confused as to what I was looking at.\n\nThis is what the note says:\n\n\\*I don't know how much longer I can work this job, the rules keep getting longer and more difficult to maintain. If you're reading this, you poor fool, follow these rules to a T and try to survive the night\\*\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor\u00a0**immediately**. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAtleast once per night you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and continue with your duties. Failure to complete this rule will begin a countdown from 3 seconds. This isn't a chance to escape. It's a head start.\n\n**Rule 4**:\n\nThere is no one else on your floor. If you hear or see something out of the corner of your eye, ignore it. If it becomes aware that you know, then leave the floor and do not return for the remainder of your shift.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost\u00a0*beast-like*\u00a0screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly. It has no intention of allowing you to escape and will feast on you if it catches you. This is the Hunt.\n\n**Rule 6**:\n\nYou may hear the sound of someone weeping from just beyond your line of sight. You are alone on the floor. Ignore it and continue your duties on that floor. As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably .\u00a0**DO NOT APPROACH**. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor. \\*Breaking this rule will initiate a hunt\\*.\n\n**Rule 7**:\n\nWhen cleaning a room, ensure all lights are on until you exit. If a room has 1 light off, leave the room and place the provided tag on the door. If all lights are off, run to the exit and do not look back. Pray it doesn't catch you.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter.\n\n**Rule 9**:\n\nNo two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*:\n\nIf your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nThe Anomaly can override other rules during the Hunt\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nDuring Hunt, only Rule 1 remains valid\n\n\\*These are all the rules I was able to discover. Please try your best to survive, and good luck.\\*\n\n\"Is this some sick joke? A means of pranking the new guy?\"\n\nI stuffed the note back into my pocket and left the closet with my supplies. I made my way up to the 2nd floor to begin cleaning. Something seemed \\*off\\* about floor 2, I started to feel incredibly sleepy even though It was only 7:58pm.\n\n\"What the h-hell... I only just started, my does it feel like I'm about to pass out.\"\n\nThat feeling of dread washed over me again, all my senses were on high alert as if my brain was telling me that something was coming. Creaking in the dark, just outside of view, similar to the monster you were afraid was under your bed as a kid. Or that irrational fear of the dark you had. Or that feeling of \\*something\\* watching you even though you know you're alone. Its in the room, crawling just around the corner as the rules had said.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*\n\n\\*If your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\\*\n\nAlmost instinctively, I dove through the nearest door and took cover under a desk. Almost immediately, the beast came crashing through the same door, slamming into the nearby wall and causing the lights to flicker on and off. The Anomaly moved with a nightmarish gait, loping on all fours with front limbs that bent forward at grotesque, inhuman angles \u2014 like shattered bones re-healed wrong, twice. Each movement was jagged, yet precise, its talons curling into the floor with a metallic scrape that echoed like nails on glass. Those claws weren\u2019t just sharp \u2014 they looked capable of cleaving through bone as if it were damp paper.\n\nIts hind legs were longer, spider-like, joints reversed and too tall, giving it the jerky sway of something not meant for this world \u2014 like a predator stitched together from the wrong parts. The skin hung off its frame in slack folds, mottled and gray, as though it wore a costume made of rotting meat it hadn\u2019t earned.\n\nIt had no eyes. Just twin pits where the sockets should\u2019ve been, black and oozing, as if they had been scooped out or never formed to begin with. Yet it\u00a0*looked*. Its head tilted and twitched toward the slightest noise or shift in air, sniffing \u2014 loud, wet inhales that rattled like lungs full of fluid.\n\nIts mouth never fully closed. Jaws sagged open just enough to reveal rows of needle-thin teeth, too many to count, some cracked and yellowed, others glistening with fresh saliva. It dragged those jaws past desk after desk, the rancid heat of its breath trailing behind like a smog of rot.\n\nIt wasn't searching. It was\u00a0*honing in*.\n\nAs it approached my hiding spot, I began sweating, I nearly broke out into tears as this monster from hell drew closer and closer. It was inches from my face when it turned away and fled. I felt a sense of relief wash over me as I got up, nearly pissing my pants because of the ordeal.\n\n\"What the hell was that...\" Was all I could manage as it reread the rules with shaking hands.\n\n\"Ok, these rules are real, and I really don't want to die here. I'll just survive and quit in the morning right?\" I said to myself frantically, now realizing the danger I was in.\n\n\"Surely an office won't be my tomb.\" Was all I could say to myself jokingly.\n\nI stepped out onto the floor and performed my duties as I went from floor to floor, rereading all the rules before entering a new room. My heart sank as I stepped onto floor 5 and realized it looked a little too similar to floor 2.\n\n\"Wait, haven't I already done this floor...?\"\n\n\"Hey, sweetie...aren't you gonna look at me?\"\n\nThat sweet, familiar voice...Michelle. We dated back in High School with plans of getting married, but a massive fallout crushed those dreams.\n\n\"M-Michelle, what are you doing here?\"\n\nI started to turn around before remembering Rule 9: \\*No two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\\*\n\nI paused for a second, contemplating what to do next. Do I walk towards the door, or do I turn to face her? It must seem like an obvious choice to the reader, but this room did more than what the rules said. For some reason, my conscious thought was slipping further and further, it was as if the floor put a spell on you that made you forget the danger you were in. I almost turned around before the alarms going off in my brain clicked. I noticed that every hair stood up, and my body tensed; I was unconsciously afraid, even though I was unaware.\n\n\"N-no, you aren't real. Michelle left a long time ago, she isn't coming back.\" Was all I could manage to say without vomiting from the fear.\n\n\"Oh don't say that, sweetie, you knew I would always come back to you.\" the Anomaly responded, it sounded forced and guttural, like a poorly done imitation of what I remember Michelle sounding like.\n\nI turned towards the door and did my best to ignore the breathing that only got louder as I got closer to the exit. Its breath was like a heatwave, the strong stench of rotten flesh filled the air around me, forcing me to hold back tears and vomit as I inched closer and closer towards the door.\n\n\"You can't escape me, Mr. Moore, I will pick the skin off your flesh and take my time tearing you apart piece by piece. I will drain you of your blood as I feast on each of your teeth, one by one, as I relish in the ecstasy of your screams. You will know true pain.\"\n\nI could only describe the voice as something akin to a thousand cries for death, the chills that went down my spine caused me to whimper even through my labored breaths.\n\n\"I will tear you limb from limb, severing each nerve as I cut into your soft flesh. You will be strung up like a puppet as I enjoy every last morsel of your being. Don't think these \\*rules\\* can save you from me.\"\n\nI made it through the door, seconds from passing out from holding my breath and nearly choking on vomit. I collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air and finally throwing up onto the stairwell. Sweat ran down every crevice of my body as I struggled to stand back up.\n\n\"Th-that was close, \\*way\\* too close.\" I struggled to push out as I calmed down and searched for the list of rules I kept in my pocket.\n\nI froze in horror as I patted myself down over and over again, searching for the rules. The blood drained from my face as I realized I had lost the list.\n\n\\*\"Wait, how did it know about the rules?\"\\* I thought to myself as it slowly dawned on me\n\n\"No, no, no no no \\*\\*NO\\*\\*!\" I let out as I finally made the realization.\n\nThe Anomaly had taken the list of rules from my pocket while I was fighting to breathe. There was nothing I could do but hope and pray that I didn't need them for the remainder of my shift. I found my supplies at the door of the real 5th floor.\n\nFloors 5 through 9 remained the same. I remembered rule ten: \\*f your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\\* and was glad I could finally ignore it.\n\n\"Only 6 more floors to go. Then I can finally leave and never come back again.\" i said to myself as i prepped to enter floor 10.\n\nThe first thing I noticed after stepping onto floor 10 was a dark puddle that seemed to ooze out of a door. I approached it and reached down to examine it closely, I'm not sure why put it felt almost mesmerizing and \\*called\\* to me, like if the puddle \\*wanted\\* me to stick my hand in it. I reached out my hand to touch the puddle before my trance was broken by the sound of weeping. I looked ahead, trying to see what was making that sound, it came from the darkness just ahead. Light didn't seem to hit it. In my brief state of clarity, I realized that 2 different rules were happening at once.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAt least once per night, you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and leave the floor.\n\n**Rule 6**:\n\nYou may hear the sound of someone weeping from just beyond your line of sight. You are alone on the floor. Ignore it and continue your duties on that floor. As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor.\n\n\\*\"3\"\\* a foreign voice said\n\n\"Crap!\" Was all I could say as I stood up and bolted for the door.\n\n\\*\"2\"\\*\n\nI had almost reached the door when the sound of talons scrapping metal echoed throughout the floor. I paused.\n\n\\*\"1\"\\* the very last sound before the Anomaly came crashing through the door\n\n\"I told you Mr. Moore. Remember what I promised.\"\n\nThe Anomaly dashed towards me on those same, twisted legs. I made it through the exit with seconds to spare and was able to lock it before the Anomaly came crashing into it.\n\n\"Mmm...well played Mr. Moore. You aren't safe from me yet, I will catch you eventually.\"\n\nThe Anomaly seemed to almost \\*chuckle\\* when he said those words.\n\nI caught my breath and started heading towards floor 11 when I found a familiar piece of paper. It was the rules I had lost before, I don't know they got here but I am glad that I found them when I did.\n\n\"Oh thank God! I thought I was going to have to rely on memory forever.\" I said gleefully.\n\nWith a newfound confidence, I made my way through floors 11 through 13 without any problems. I continued to study and memorize the rules before reaching floor 14. As I stepped onto the floor, something caught my eye. There was an oddly placed wooden door at the end of the hall. I made sure pull out the rule sheet to confirm my mental note.\n\n\\*All doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\\*\n\n\"Yup, just as I thought. Surely there's no harm in approaching the door, maybe even taking a look around.\"\n\nTaking a look around, I was able to admire the interior of this building. Floor 14 was decorated with baby blue walls and shiny metal doors that screamed \"children's hospital\". The walls had pictures on them, some on doors, and others on the walls themselves. Some read\n\n\"Happy birthday!\"\n\nOthers read\n\n\"Sorry for your loss.\"\n\nI made it to the second-to-last door before the wooden one. That was weird, there was a smaller piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the door. I bent down to pick it up, and this is what it says:\n\n\"Pay attention to the running Mr. Moore.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold as I finally heard it, there was a frantic shuffling coming from the stairwell, it was accompanied by a wailing screech that sounded like a wounded animal. I finally snapped back to my senses and reread the rule sheet:\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost\u00a0*beast-like*\u00a0screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly. It has no intention of allowing you to escape and will feast on you if it catches you.\n\nI gathered my thoughts and raced for the exit, it sounded like the Anomaly was on floor 7, halfway here. I struggled to run with my damaged legs and started panicking as I practically waddled to the stairwell.\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*Mr. Moore\\*\\*\\*\" I could hear the Anomaly, it was on floor 12, 2 floors away.\n\nI made it to the stairwell and could see the sign:\n\n\\*\\*Floor 15\\*\\*\n\nI started climbing the stairs, moving as fast as I could and praying that I would make it. Sweat ran through my whole body as I begged to some higher power that I could make it before I was too late.\n\n\"I can smell you Daniel. The stench of your fear is like a drug, I can't get enough of it!\"\n\nThe Anomaly was on floor 14, it was here. I was only a few steps away when I heard it. The sound of metal on metal was painful to say the least, I felt as though my eardrums were about to burst when I finally made it to Floor 15 and through open the door. I turned around to see the Anomaly enter the stairwell with me and fly up the stairs as I fell through the door. I thought I was about to crap my pants while waiting in anticipation for the Anomaly to come crashing through. However, that moment never came.\n\n\"Oh, thank God.\" Was all I could say, wiping the tears from my face and trying to collect my thoughts.\n\nThis was the final floor before I was finally free. I got up and prepared to clear the floor before I heard a sound that made me begin to cry again.\n\n\\*tap, tap, tap\\* there was a rhythmic tapping coming from the door at the other end of the hall.\n\nI couldn't see the door but could hear the wood reverberating across the entire hall. As the sounds hit me, I felt a \"red-alert\" hit my brain and decided to check the rules real quick. I noticed a rule that had never been in play until now:\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 have either occurred or are occurring. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter. This initiates a Hunt.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nIf the Hunt is currently active, all rules except rules 1 and 12 are valid.\n\n\"Wait... I'm save! Rule 6 already happened on floor 10, and rule 8 is happening right now.\"\n\nThinking I was in the clear, I sprinted toward the staircase without hesitation\u2014until one burning question flooded my mind:\n\n*How the hell am I gonna clear 15 floors in 20 seconds?*\n\nI thought I was safe, I still had 1 hurdle remaining, though. I didn't waste a precious seconding clearing floors while coming up with an idea that would let me make it out of here in one piece, I had to jump once the Anomaly made it to the stairwell.\n\n\\*3, 2, 1\\*\n\nI could hear the same howling that once made me terrified. The Anomaly came through, and was coming to take my life.\n\n\"You've sealed your fate, Mr. Moore.\" It didn\u2019t bother with theatrics this time. Its voice was calm. That made it worse.\n\nI looked up from the 9th floor and could see him staring down at me. The Anomaly seemed to move almost methodically, not an ounce of urgency, just its talons tearing into the concrete walls like they were papier mache. At the time, didn't care about the Anomalys odd movements, I was in the home stretch and had every intention of jumping from floor 9 down to floor 1 knowing fully well it would break my legs but that I would be safe.\n\n\\*\"I've got one shot at this.\"\\* I said to myself as I lined up over the edge.\n\nI looked up the Anomaly one last time, with a new confidence that was immediately shattered.\n\nThe Anomaly\u2019s face was changing. Warping. Becoming something else.\n\nIt was still vaguely human, but wrong in every possible way. Hundreds of pus-filled spores bloomed across its eyes, each one weeping milky fluid. Its teeth\u2014if you could call them that\u2014were rotting stumps spilling blood like a faucet. And its nose... it wasn\u2019t gone. It was replaced. A gaping hole, black and endless, like it led straight into hell.\n\nI froze.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it smiled.\n\n\"Something wrong, Mr. Moore?\"\n\nIt spoke with a belly laugh, each exhalation forcing blood to pour out in all directions.\n\nThe lights were being stained with a seemingly endless pool of blood that made me jump. Not out of confidence in survival. But out of fear of something worse than death.\n\n\\*\\*\\*BOOM\\*\\*\\*\n\nI could feel my legs shatter as I hit the ground. Bone fragments had pierced my skin because of force, nearly turning my legs into pancakes. I was unable to move as blood started pooling in my mouth. In front of me lay 7 of my teeth and a giant pool of blood from my now leaking nose. I don't know if it was out of fear or adrenaline, but I started dragging myself across the same red carpets I saw when I came in. My closet. My haven. It was only 10 feet away.\n\n\\*\"So close, and yet so far...\"\\* I thought to myself as I used the rest of my strength to avoid losing consciousness, the concussion was going to sting when I fully recovered.\n\nFor now, all I could think to do was crawl, crawl and pray that I could make the grand escape.\n\n\"So you survived Mr. Moore. Impressive. Maybe you \\*are\\* worth chasing after all.\" the Anomaly said in a taunting voice.\n\nIt was still on the 15th floor but started moving, \\*fast\\*. It was only floor 10 when I was only 4 steps away from the door.\n\n\\*Floor 7\\*\n\n\\*3ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 5\\*\n\n\\*2ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 3\\*\n\n\\*1ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 1\\*\n\n\"Mr. Moore.\" The Anomaly said, it had returned to its sinister and fear driven tone.\n\n\"I will rip out your insides and use them as a straw. Your skin will be my towel. Your teeth will be my cereal. You have any ideas on how I should use your bones after I've ripped them out of you?\"\n\nThe Anomaly came barreling towards the door and \\*almost\\* made it. I was able to close the door just in time. I had made it. Safe. Alive. Badly injured but still good enough to make it home.\n\n\"Im safe you monster! You can't touch me.\" I proclaimed this triumphantly, unaware of how much danger I was \\*really\\* in.\n\n\"Oh, sweetie...remember what I promised you?\" The Anomaly had taken on a twisted combination of his voice and Michelle's voice.\n\nI started panicking and pulled out the rule sheet again. Whatever blood I had left went ice cold as I read the rules one last time and started slowly crying to myself:\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor\u00a0**immediately**. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAtleast once per night you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and continue with your duties. Failure to complete this rule will begin a countdown from 3 seconds. This isn't a chance to escape. It's a head start.\n\n**Rule 4**:\n\nThere is no one else on your floor. If you hear or see something out of the corner of your eye, ignore it. If it becomes aware that you know, then leave the floor and do not return for the remainder of your shift.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost\u00a0*beast-like*\u00a0screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly. It has no intention of allowing you to escape and will feast on you if it catches you.\n\n**Rule 6**:\n\nYou may hear the sound of someone weeping from just beyond your line of sight. You are alone on the floor. Ignore it and continue your duties on that floor. As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably .\u00a0**DO NOT APPROACH**. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor. Breaking this rule will initiate the hunt.\n\n**Rule 7**:\n\nWhen cleaning a room, ensure all lights are on until you exit. If a room has 1 light off, leave the room and place the provided tag on the door. If all lights are off, run to the exit and do not look back. Pray it doesn't catch you.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter.\n\n**Rule 9**:\n\nNo two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*:\n\nIf your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nIf the Hunt is currently active, all rules except rules 1 and 12 are valid.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nIf you find that you have broken one of the rules, dial Mr. Haslow.\n\nThe Anomaly started clawing at the door, pounding on it continuously while shouting:\n\n\"I promised you, sweetie.\" Imitating Michelle's voice perfectly\n\nI found one last hope, the final card up my sleeve.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nIf you find that you have broken one of the rules, dial Mr. Haslow directly. He will provide you with instructions.\n\nI picked up my phone with my remaining strength and dialed the number.\n\n\"H-Hello?\" I felt a wave of relief wash over me as Mr. Haslow answered the phone\n\n\"Mr. Haslow! The Anomaly is about to breach the closet and kill me. What do I do?\"\n\nI was met with a silence that seemed to last a thousand lifetimes\n\n\"Hello? Are you there, Mr. Haslow?\" I said, still searching for a way out.\n\n\"Nice try, sweetie.\" Was all I was met with; it didn't come from the door, though. It came from the phone.\n\nAll I could do was weep, tear after tear covered my face as I realized that the Anomaly had trapped me here long before I ever stepped foot in the building.\n\nIn the moments before the Anomaly broke down the door, I found one last crumpled piece of paper. With what little strength I had left, I picked it up and unrolled it, thinking it would be a means of survival. Instead, I'm hit with the cruelest of them all:\n\n\\*Rule 13: The Anomaly can change the rules; memorize them before you leave.\"\n\nI had lost. No chance at escape. My final thoughts being transcribed into this post I share with all of you now.\n\nSo, if you ever find yourself with a janitor job that is too good to be true, remember these rules:\n\n\\*\\*Rule 1\\*\\*:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously.

I had just got off my shift and finally thought I had the rest of the night to myself, so I sit in the my chair, recline the seat back, grab a beer and watch my favourite show Dexter. As I sat their for hours, mindlessly staring into the realistic reality of Dexter, I hear a a crash of thunder and lightning outside, I expected this to happen as the weather report from today said hurricane Charlie was closing in on Punta Gorda. Suddenly, it goes black. \u201cDang it, power went out!\u201d I shouted as Dexter was about to inject Miguel with his syringe. Sitting there, in the dark, made me realise how lonely I am. My deep thoughts were interrupted by a crash from outside from a tree being uprooted. Shocked, I headed into the basement in case any trees came smashing into my house. I head down the creaky steps, tip toeing in case the steps had been worn down since the last time being down here. In the corner of my eye, I see a silhouette move due to the flash of light from the lighting surrounding my house. I turn. I pick up a wooden bat which was a reminder to the glory days of college baseball. I slowly inch closer to the light switch, carefully trying to avoid the person in my basement. I\u2019m an inch a way from flicking the switch, I hear mumbling and crackling from within the darkness of my cellar. I flick the switch. My face froze. My parents lay on the cold, marble floor.. Lifeless. Not only were they lifeless, there joints, ripped apart from the ligaments which used to hold them together, the corpses of my once parents, mangled but to the point I could recognises parts of their face. However, I couldn\u2019t say the same for the rest of them. Their torso had the skin ripped off them to the point their ribcage was showing. As I look further down their bodies, the more mangled and unrecognisable they had become. As I took in the macabre scene which had unfolded in-front of me, I noticed the presence behind the mangled scene before me. A figure, almost the size of the basement, imposing on all the carnage it had made. Wet, tearing sounds came from its mouth, however, no mouth was on him. It\u2019s long fingers plunged towards the corpse of my mother, pulling her torso from the remaining remnants of her, and devouring the entire thing. My grip on the baseball bat weakened, and due to that, I dropped it. The sound must of alerted the entity to my presence. I froze in terror. I went to run but it was as if my legs were stuck to the floor. The entity inched closer to me. It\u2019s long fingers inching ever closer. However, its main body still incased in darkness. I finally was able to move. I ran. But tripped over on the wet, slippery blood leaking from my parent\u2019s corpse. The creatures fingers pierced my lower back. Instantly giving me the sense of pure twisted intentions. The words were spoken in a voice that was pure, unadulterated malevolence, a demonic growl that vibrated through every cell in my body \u201cdon\u2019t worry.

We had first moved to the north-west of the country, but after a year of living there, we then relocated to the Irish midlands, as my dad had gotten a new job working in Dublin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy parents had bought a cottage on the outskirts of a very small village, that was a stopping point from one of the larger towns to the next. This village was so small and remote, there was basically nothing to do. But not long after moving here, and taking to exploring the surrounding area with my Border Collie, Maisie, I eventually found a large stretch of bogland containing a man-made forest. Every weekend or half-term away from school, I took to walking this area with my dog, in which I would follow along a railway line used for transporting peat. However, after months of trekking this very same bogland, I eventually stopped going there. I can\u2019t quite recall the reason why, but maybe it was because I always felt as though I was trespassing (which I wasn\u2019t) or because the bogland was so bumpy and uneven, I always came home with horrific blisters.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlthough I stopped going to this bogland to walk my dog, outside one of the nearby towns where I went to school, there was a public forest. Because this forest was a twenty-minute drive away, my dad would take me and Maisie there, drop us off and then pick us up again two or three hours later. What I loved about these woods was that it was always quiet \u2013 only with the occasional family, dog-walker or jogger passing us by.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn one particular evening, I had gone back to these woods with Maisie, where my dad would later pick us up after running some errands. Making our way along the trail, the evening had already started to dimmer. Wanting to make my way back to the car park before it got too dark, I decided to take a short cut through the forest, via one of the many narrow side-trials. Following down one of these side-trials, me and Maisie stumbled upon a small tipi-shaped hut made from logs. Loving a good game of hide and seek, I would sometimes hide inside this tipi when Maisie wasn\u2019t looking, where she would spend the next couple of minutes circling round the hut trying to find me \u2013 not realizing she could just go inside.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhether I played this game with Maisie that day, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 but following down this exact same side-trail, I turn to look behind me. Staring down the entryway, I then see a man walking twenty metres behind, having just taken this side-trail... For some unknown reason, I had a strange instant feeling about this man, even though I had only just noticed him. I can\u2019t remember or even describe the way this man was walking, but the way he did so felt suspicious to me. Listening to my instincts, or perhaps just my paranoia, I quickly latch my lead back onto Maisie and hurriedly make my way down the trail.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA few minutes later, although I had reached back onto the main trail, the evening had already turned much darker. Again turning to see if the man was behind me, I could still see him around the curve, only ten metres away from me now. I did try to tell myself I was just being paranoid, and this man was most likely not following me - but my gut instinct still told me something was off.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThinking ahead, I pull out my phone to call my dad, as to make sure he was already in the car park waiting for me \u2013 but there was no answer. Because there was no answer, I just assumed he was probably still driving \u2013 and because he was still driving, I just hoped my dad was nearly on his way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBy the time I make it back to the car park, it was basically pitch black by now, and there was just one single car in the parking area... but it wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s. Sitting down by a picnic bench to wait for him to come and get us, all I could do was hope he would be coming soon and that this strange man from the woods was not following me after all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOnly a minute or two later, I could hear the footsteps of this very same man approaching through the darkness. Anxiously anticipating him pass by, I try to distract myself on my phone \u2013 or at least make myself seem less approachable. Thankfully enough, the man just walks completely by me. Entering the car park, the man then gets in his vehicle - the only car in the car park... but he doesn\u2019t drive away... He just stays there, sat inside his car with both the engine and headlights turned on...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTwenty minutes must have gone by, but my dad still wasn\u2019t here \u2013 and yet this very same stranger was... Trying to call and text my dad to say I was waiting for him, I was met with no answer. While I continued waiting, I tried to rationalize why this man hadn\u2019t decided to drive off. Whatever reasons I came up with, they were not very convincing for me - and for those whole twenty, or however many more minutes, I sat outside those woods in complete darkness, hearing nothing but the hum of this stranger\u2019s engine among the silent night air.\u00a0\n\nWhat made this situation even more anxiety-inducing, was that my dog Maisie had been endlessly whining by my feet \u2013 scraping dirt away beneath the bench to make a surprisingly deep hole. Maisie was in general a very nervous dog and basically whined at everything \u2013 but perhaps she too felt as though something about this situation wasn\u2019t right.\u00a0\n\nThankfully, after what felt far longer than twenty-so minutes, the strange man, already with his engine and headlights on, reverses from his parking spot, exits out of the car park and onto the main road \u2013 leaving me and Maisie in peace. Although we were now alone, basically stranded outside of a dark forest, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a huge sigh of relief come over me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy dad did eventually come and get us \u2013 ten minutes after the man had finally decided to drive off... Do you want to know what my dad\u2019s excuse was as to why he was so late?... He forgot he had to pick us up.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t know if that man really was following me through the forest, and I definitely don\u2019t know why he just sat in his car for twenty minutes... But if I had to learn anything from that experience, it would be the following... One: my dad can sometimes be a careless douche... and Two:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNever hike through the forest alone, late in the evening.\u00a0"},"36":{"title":"NSFW-Without Reason","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kbfqet\/nsfwwithout_reason\/","flair":null,"author":"No-Yogurtcloset-1079","selftext":"Jeromy was sitting in his rusty, washed-out Ford Focus across from his local Walmart. He had been preparing for this day for weeks; it had been all he could think about for months. Jeromy had been struggling a lot lately. It felt like everything he did was pointless. \u201cWell, this will be the last pointless thing I do,\u201d he whispers to himself. Jeromy reaches behind the seat and grabs his AR-15. I could be more original, but I guess there is a reason everyone chooses this one for the job. \u201cSome say the AR-15 is a weapon of mass destruction; I believe people are.\u201d Jeromy chuckles, \u201cThis will be fun.\u201d Jeromy smiles; he is finally going through with it after so many nights of dreaming of this final outcome. He reaches into his blue, stained hoodie pocket, pulls out the faithful magazine, and slides it into his AR-15. He looks at the writing down the magazine well. It reads, \"Without reason.\" \u201cNow that\u2019s pretty original,\u201d he says out loud. This whole world is without reason, if you really consider it. Jeromy shakes his head and focuses on the task at hand. Time to help some people get out of this shitty existence. He opens the car door; it opens with a protesting creak. There is a woman walking into the entrance with her daughter, hand in hand. Jeromy raises the AR-15 and fires off two shots. The woman\u2019s back tears open in two places as she collapses mid-stride. The daughter, who is no more than six years old, screams and twirls around. She looks Jeromy in the eyes. Jeromy\u2019s eyes flash like a tiger\u2019s when it sees prey running in an open field. He squeezes off one shot. It strikes the child center mass. She is hurled to the ground as if she were hit by an NFL linebacker. I knew the hours at the range would pay off on this day of liberation. At this point, he can hear screams coming from inside the Walmart. He calmly walks through the sliding doors, making sure to put one more shot into the back of the mother\u2019s head. That should do it. The child is still squirming like a worm on a fishing hook. He pays no mind to her. Jeromy continues through the man trap and into the store. He sees a clerk crouched behind the register. She\u2019s quietly sobbing, \u201cPlease stop,\u201d she pleads. \u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor; you just don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d Jeromy says, smiling at her. He raises the rifle and puts two molten-hot heaps of lead into her. She slumps and slowly slides onto her back. Jeromy takes a moment to watch the woman. She is about 23 years old, with vibrant purple hair. The woman lies supine, looking up at Jeromy with wide eyes, gasping her final breaths like a fish out of water. \u201cThe purple hair really fits you,\u201d Jeromy says to the woman as all the red-hot life leaks out of her. The smell of copper is thick in the air at this point. I didn\u2019t think blood would smell this strong. There\u2019s a scuffling sound coming from two aisles down. Jeromy whips around, taking off in the direction of the sound. He rounds the corner and sees a couple huddled behind a shopping cart. \u201cNow that won\u2019t do any good,\u201d Jeromy laughs. \u201cFuck off, you psychopath,\u201d the man says. Jeromy\u2019s fragile ego takes offense to this statement. He raises the rifle once again, with even more hatred this time. He squeezes off one shot. It strikes the woman in the head, spraying blood and bits of scalp onto the husband as her head snaps back as if she had been punched by a UFC fighter. The husband screams. He and the woman were getting groceries for their honeymoon. They were leaving that evening for a week-long trip that would never come to fruition. The man starts sobbing. \u201cWell, shit man, that sucks,\u201d Jeromy says tauntingly. Jeromy leaves the man violently sobbing in the aisle as he continues toward the back of the store. Jeromy sees the two black swing doors that lead to the stocking area. I\u2019ve had my fun. Jeromy goes through the two doors toward his final performance. He finds a chair an employee left in a back corner. He grabs it and places it in the middle of the stocking floor. He then takes out a piece of notebook paper from his old hoodie pocket, along with a black Sharpie. He proceeds to write, \u201cThank you for the fun time; maybe we can do it again in the next life,\u201d on the paper. Jeromy then sits down on the chair, takes a deep breath, and gently places the end of the rifle\u2019s barrel against his right temple. He read that the best way of self-extraction with a firearm is to go for the temple. Too many people survive when going from below the chin. He definitely didn\u2019t want that. The rifle goes off into eternal darkness. Parts of Jeromy go all over the cold cement floor. Jeromy\u2019s lifeless husk slides gently down the chair until it finds a nice resting spot. Blood pours all over the note Jeromy intended for the police to find, causing the black Sharpie to smear into illegible streaks. Well, shit; guess that was pointless as well.\n\nNote: I do not support or condone mass shootings. This is just a story.

Today, that house no longer exists, it's been torn down and replaced with a modern apartment building. But back then, the house had a cozy, almost antique style.\n\nIt had two floors: the first floor, where my mother's sister and her family lived, and the second floor, where my own family stayed. A narrow staircase tucked into the corner of the house connected the two floors, and near that staircase was a dark hallway leading to the bathroom and toilet.\n\nI won\u2019t go into details about my family members, because this story is not about them, it's about me, and one night I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nDuring the daytime, the house felt completely normal, safe, warm, even a little charming.\nBut when midnight came... it transformed.

I couldn\u2019t just ignore it and fall back asleep. I had to go to the bathroom... but the problem was, the path to the toilet was pitch-black and terrifying. There were barely any lights, and my young eyes couldn\u2019t see much in the dark.

I know it's gross, but at that age, fear won over shame.\n\nAfterward, I would quietly sneak back into bed and fall asleep, pretending everything was fine.\nAnd this became my nightly routine peeing on the stairs around exactly 12:00 a.m.\n\nFor a while, nothing strange happened.\n\nUntil one night... the night that changed everything.\n\nAs usual, I woke up at midnight, feeling the familiar pressure in my bladder. I tiptoed to the door entrance and prepared to do what I had done so many times before. But this time... something was different.\n\nAs I was peeing, I suddenly felt a cold chill wrap around my body.

My whole body locked in fear.\n\nThen, slowly, she raised one bony hand and pointed straight at me.\nShe began to curl her finger, motioning for me to come closer.\nI heard her cracked, ghostly voice whispering over and over again:\n\"Come... come... come...\"\n\nThe sound made my blood run cold.\n\nSomehow, by pure instinct, my body broke free from the fear that had paralyzed me. I stumbled backward, rushed inside the house, and leapt into the bed where my mother was sleeping. I pressed myself against her, hoping that being near her would keep me safe.\n\nBut the nightmare wasn\u2019t over yet.\n\nI watched with wide, terrified eyes as that shadowy old woman crawled along the wall like some nightmarish spider, creeping closer and closer toward me.\n\nShe didn\u2019t come all the way to the bed, though.\nSomething stopped her.\nRight above my sleeping mother was a Buddha image, and it seemed like the spirit couldn\u2019t cross past its protection.\n\nStill, the woman lingered.\nShe stood there at the edge of the room, repeating the same motion, beckoning me with her finger to come to her. Over and over again.\n\nI didn't know what else to do. I squeezed my eyes shut as tight as I could, clung to my mother, and prayed for morning to come.\n\nWhen I finally opened my eyes, sunlight was pouring into the room.\nI was safe.\n\nNo wounds, no signs of what had happened... but the memory of that night has never left me.\n\nI know what I saw was real.\nI was too young, too innocent to imagine such a thing, I didn\u2019t even know what ghosts or horror were at that time.\n\nThat was, without a doubt, the most terrifying experience of my life.\n\nThank you for reading my story.\nI truly hope you guys believe me...\ud83d\udda4\nEnglish is not my first language...

It happened about 6\u20137 years ago, in the mountain village where I grew up.\n\nAbout a kilometer outside the village, there's a narrow road leading to a small soccer field, built by our community. The field lies at the edge of a dense forest, filled with towering pines. That summer, I was around 16 years old. My friends and I spent countless nights sitting in a wooden shelter next to the field, beneath the endless sky, surrounded by the deep silence of the woods.\n\nClose to the road leading to the field, there\u2019s a sheep farm \u2014 a small, lonely place right by the roadside. One night, as we sat in the shelter, the quiet was shattered by a terrible sound.\nThe sheep were screaming.\nNot just bleating \u2014 screaming, as if being slaughtered. The sound stretched on and on, filling the night air with a raw, primal terror. We froze.\nAt first, we told ourselves it must be a wolf, maybe even a bear \u2014 predators we were all too familiar with in those mountains. But deep down, something felt wrong. The cruelty, the pain behind the sounds... it was different. More brutal. More unnatural.\n\nAfter a while, we decided to head back to the village. We walked down the dark road, passing the silent farm. Just beyond it, to the left, there\u2019s a steep hill rising from the road, leading into the endless forest. A single tall streetlamp stands there, casting a dim, sickly light onto the hill\u2019s edge.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I saw it.\n\nAt first, just a flicker of movement \u2014 then a shape, moving down the hill at an unnatural speed. It was on all fours, greyish-white in color, and it raced toward the road ahead of us, no more than 200 meters away.\nMy heart dropped.\nI shouted to my friends, asking if they had seen it \u2014 but none of them had. They thought I was imagining things.\nWe hurried to the spot where I had seen the thing descend.\nNothing.\nNo sound, no movement. It had disappeared completely.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was.\nBut I know what it wasn\u2019t.\nIt wasn\u2019t a man.\nIt wasn\u2019t an animal.\nIt was something... else.\n\nFor years, I wondered what I had seen. I tried to rationalize it. A wolf? No \u2014 the farm dogs would have gone crazy if a wolf had come that close. But they had been silent.\nRecently, I came across videos and stories about \"Skinwalkers.\" Creatures from ancient legends, shapeshifters that lurk on the edges of human settlements. The description matches closely \u2014 too closely for comfort.\n\nI don't know if I truly saw a skinwalker that night. Maybe I never will.\nBut even now, every summer when I return to my village, I walk that same road at night \u2014 sometimes alone, with only the sound of my own footsteps and the breathing silence of the forest around me.\n\nGrowing up there, I learned not to fear the dark.\nBut what I saw that night wasn\u2019t part of the darkness I knew.\nIt was something foreign.\nSomething that didn\u2019t belong.\nAnd though a part of me hopes to never see it again... another part of me desperately wants to.\nTo know.\nTo understand.\n\nThank you for reading my story. I would truly appreciate hearing your thoughts and what you think I might have encountered that night."},"43":{"title":"Psychological Horror Game Ideas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k9b6dp\/psychological_horror_game_ideas\/","flair":null,"author":"Joja_bings","selftext":"I'm an indie-dev: give me your best ideas for a psychologiacal horrorgame that will make the player poop his pants or sum."},"44":{"title":"Don\u2019t Eat Guilt-Free Meat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k8x0jm\/dont_eat_guiltfree_meat\/","flair":null,"author":"LegendarylankmanArt","selftext":"The headlines broadcasted across every news network read like a proverb:\n\nDON\u2019T EAT GUILT-FREE MEAT.\n\nThe Hearty Harvest Corporation\u2019s so-called \u201chumane\u201d meat was hailed as a global breakthrough in ethical science. The media frenzy was ravenous, and the public\u2019s reception was universally positive.\n\nGuilt-free. Cruelty-free. Pain-free. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s how it was sold.\n\nIt came in cans. It came in packs. It came sizzling off fast-food grills.\n\nNo animals harmed. No blood spilled.\n\nJust clean, cultured protein \u2014 \u201cEat with a conscience\u201d \u2014 was the tagline plastered across billboards as you sat in traffic, morning and night.\n\nTheir influence was inescapable. Everywhere you turned, someone was talking about it. And the world, quite literally, ate it up.\n\nBut like all things floured in benevolence, there was a catch.\nOr maybe just a controversy waiting to boil over.\n\nAnd boil over it did.\n\nIt started quietly \u2014 with strange cravings. Online forums lit up with users claiming they\u2019d lost their appetite for anything but Hearty Harvest\u2019s so-called guilt-free meat. Vegetables, fruits, even traditional meats \u2014 none of it satisfied.\n\nOnly the Hearty Harvest meat could.\n\nThe craving soon turned into obsession.\nThen something deeper. Something primal. Was unleashed upon the masses.\n\nDoctors began to sound the alarm. The symptoms were eerily similar to high-dose opioid addiction:\nSweats. Tremors. Hallucinations.\nNight terrors.\nPeople reported vivid dreams of harming their loved ones \u2014 and worse, waking with the urge still gnawing at the edges of their psyche.\n\nThe headlines started turning against the company and the controversies stacked higher.\nViral videos emerged: people smashing into supermarkets and storming malls \u2014 not for electronics or money, but for cans, packs, patties of that damned meat.\n\nOthers broke into homes.\nHeld neighbors hostage.\nWhole apartment buildings barricaded and brutalized.\nAll for a bite.\nThe world was set ablaze, and all those who never even sampled the meat got caught in the fire.\n\nEventually, the Hearty Harvest Corp. was forced to pull the product from shelves worldwide.\nBut it was already far, far too late.\n\nWhat remained became black-market gold.\n\nThe meat sold in back alleys like it was the new sacred compound.\n\nPeople quit jobs. Quit speaking. Quit living.\nOnly the hunger remained.\nThey changed \u2014 not into beasts with fangs and claws, but something far worse.\n\nA species without empathy.\n\nDriven by a bottomless, insatiable hunger.\nAnd when the last of the meat was gone\u2026\n\nThey turned to other sources.\n\nAnimals, devoured alive.\nPets. Neighbors. Family.\nBit by bit.\nEverything that walked, breathed, or begged for mercy \u2014 became sustenance. Anything to cater to the hollow void within them. Hoping to receive a temporary full. \n\nThe world Hearty Harvest promised \u2014 one free of cruelty \u2014 birthed something infinitely more inhuman.\nAnd far more...\n\n... Cruel.\n\n\u2026..\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in hiding for the last twenty months.\nSurviving. Broadcasting.\nAvoiding the Mawlers \u2014 that\u2019s what we call them now.

Locked away in a vault said to be strong enough to withstand even the wrath of nuclear weaponry.\nBut the material it was written on? Far less impressive on the defense scale:\n\nPaper.\n\nFragile. Flammable. Destroyable.\nDeliberately chosen for the mentioned reasons. If anyone ever tried to steal it, tamper with it, or force it out of hiding \u2014 It would ignite and burn. Reduced to embers in seconds. Its recipe \u2014 and with it, the only known antidote to this widespread disease \u2014 could vanish in an instant. One careless move, one wrong set of hands, and humanity\u2019s last hope would be lost forever.\n\nThe vault could only be opened if all five came together.\nBut now? Their locations are unknown.

Tales and rumors swirl across the fractured nations - whispers of people claiming to hold the passcode, or to be one of the legendary five. \n\nSome even swear they\u2019ve found the actual vault. But the coordinates always lead to the same deadends:\nRuins. Traps. Empty buildings. Bones. But never the impenetrable vault. Like a ghost you can only hear, but never see. \n\nYet still, I continue to search.\nBecause I have to.\nBecause if an answer exists \u2014 it\u2019s our only shot at survival.\n\nThis is Bugfeed.\nSigning off\u2026 for now.\n\nBe safe while treading the hostile surface of our lost planet. And if you\u2019re hearing this \u2014\n\nIf you know anything \u2014\nFind me. \n\nYou just may just be the one to resurrect what\u2019s left of the fallen world.\n\n\n"},"45":{"title":"So I want to write a book","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k91zll\/so_i_want_to_write_a_book\/","flair":null,"author":"Wimches","selftext":"I wanted to write a horror book. I've been having a nightmare a few weeks ago and it still haunts me (luckily not as much as the few days after that dream). What happened in that dream wasn't really scary, as a guy just followed me around and watched me. But I think that it would make a great story. Here's a little summary:\n\nI'm home alone, my parents are grocery shopping with my siblings. The house I live in is near three cemeteries, which is kind of creepy but nothing ever happened here. It's also near a forest, yet still kinda in the city (which will be very important). So I'm making myself some food and go to my room, which is on the second floor. The weather is nice and so I decide to open my window when I see a guy in all black clothes with a mask on. The mask has one eye in the middle and a smile that kind of swirls around the eye. I get slightly startled and look away. It's not uncommon to see weird people in my city so I don't think much of it. Maybe it was just a prank? So I eat my food and then my dad calls me, he asks if I can get something from my parents bedroom, since they will be home soon and need it. I agree and go there. Now when I look out the window the guy with the mask is there again. Still staring at me and standing in our backyard. It's really creepy and for a minute or so I just stare back. It's not hard to get in our backyard, since people could just walk in but it's still weird. I wait till my parents get home and tell them what happened. My dad says that if I see that guy again (he was gone apparently), I should call him. And so I did, because the door was open and that guy stood there on the street. My parents immediately start to ask the guy questions and my mom gets near the front door. She suddenly collapses, someone threw something at her. My dad pulls her away with my uncle and I just stand there unsure of what to do. So I decide to go to the police but they didn't do much. I walked there and so I walk back. But just as I was almost home, the guy is there again. He's standing in front of my house and staring at me. He doesn't come near me but I also don't go near him. He's just staring like he always did. Then everything goes dark and I'm in a room with nothing in it. Just the guy standing in front of me. Then I woke up. After the dream I could still feel the panic when I look outside windows because I thought that guy might appear there. Also he never talked, moved or went into the house. He just stood there doing nothing.\n\nI know it's kinda much, but I really enjoy writing stories and books and I thought this could be one. Also I'm very sorry for my bad grammar, English isn't my first language."},"46":{"title":"Welcome to Wonderland: I'm working on a analog horror story but it's all written because I can't video edit. if anyone want to do it, feel free just mention me or something.

Have fun.\n\nFor most people, Lunapark is an amazing pastime. A place where you make memories for your whole life, and a place you call \"magical\". I remember, that when I was a kid I've always wanted to go there. All of those TV shows about the \"great time in the Lunapark\" and all of the newspapers. But because my family was not the richest, I've never actually been to one. So ever since I was 8 years old, it was my dream to be in a Lunapark. I remember that there was a certain TV show called \"Phil's playground\". I used to watch it with my friends when we were younger. Especially with Josh. And Josh was my best friend. We grew up together and we always had each other's back. I remember how we always had our own jokes that only we could understood.\n\n**\"Phil's playground\"**\n\nI still remember how much I loved this show. Josh and I were addicted to it. There was somthing about that show that made me feel good. we watched every day at 5PM at josh's big house. we liked all the characters, but one in particular. Phil. Oh phil. He had a strange hair, small ears and a small bracelet on the right hand that said \"its playtime!\". But the weird thing about him was his blue eyes. They were huge. Not humen. Josh and I always found it weird that his eyes didn't match his face. But we were kids so we didn't really care. We loved phil's humor and admired him.\n\n**1987 April 12th**\n\nAt that time I was 15. I still watched \"Phils playground\" with Josh but much less. Most of the time that we would meet was to do math homework and studying for tests. At April 12th, Josh and I met at his big and fancy house to do some homework.\n\nI knocked on his door. But he did not open. I knocked again and yet no answer.\n\n\"Josh? Josh where are you?\" I said. Finally, after 5 minutes of me staring at his door, he opened his door.\n\nJosh welcomed me into his home and we started to do the homework. It took us around 30 minutes to finish it. I was going to go back home but then Josh said \"hey Dean... stay for a bit more\" I kind of didn't want to stay but I did anyway. \"Did you hear what happened to Phil's Playground? \" he said.\n\n\"What? no... what happened? \"\n\n\" It got shut down... for unkonwn reason.\"\n\n\"Oh\" I sighed. \"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Nope... nobody does. Police isn't talking and the news have more important things to do.\"\n\nThen I had an idea.\n\n\"Why won't we go check what happened ourselves? I mean we are bored anyway...\" To this day, I dont know why those words came out of my mouth and why I didn't regret it. \"why not\" Josh said. \"But it's getting late we should do it tomorrow\". \n\nI took a flashlight, water and a hat. And here we were, riding on our bikes on our way to Phil's playground. I was never there and neither was Josh so we were kind of excited. It was far away, and I honestly couldn't wait to see for the first time The Phil's Playground.\n\n**Its playtime**\n\nI thought it would be difficult to get in... but the place was empty. There was nobody there. No workers, no police officers. Nothing. we started walking to the entry and left our bikes. We couldn't get through the gate because we had no tickets, but we managed to climb over the fence. \"Wow... this place is huge\" I said. And it really was. \"Not exactly the way I wanted to visit here\" Josh said. \n\nWe saw a stand of Phil's dolls. I thought it was cool,  especially because of the sound it made. \"Its playttime!\" with a cute voice. Phil's voice. Josh and I both took one and put it in our bags. We started to walk through the Lunapark and everything looked normal. Until we reached the Ferris wheel. It was still working... but there was no one to activate it. It was strange, we were alone. \"You think we aren't alone?\" Josh said. \"No... Maybe they  forgot to stop it\". It didn't make any sense but it wasn't too strange. Josh said he needs to go to the toilet, and so he did and I kept on staring at the feris wheel. I looked at every seat, but nobody was there. Except one thing. There was a weird strange blue liquid. It smelled. I didn't know why on earth would there be a blue liquid on a random seat but for some reason... I didn't really find it that weird again. \n\nBut then somthing happened. I heard laughter. I didn't know where it came from but I felt like it was behind but there was nothing there.\"Josh It's not funny\" I shouted. But he didn't answer. I went to the toilet to check if he was there. I opened the door and what I saw... gave me chills. It was this blue liquid. But not just that... where is Josh? I opened every toilet stall but what happened next... was terryfing. In the last toilet stall there was a body of a child. With a distorted face and huge eyes. I was in shock... I was scared like I had never been scared before. But what scared me the most was that Josh has disappeared. I closed the toilet stall and turned around. I looked in the mirror... and what I saw could not be real. The mirror had writing in blood on it... \"Its playtime!\" I fell to my knees in panic. My  heart dropped and I couldn't move. I didn't wanna play... I did not. I started shaking uncontrollably. Until I was brave enough to get up and punch that mirror as hard as I could. Punch after punch, until I broke it. My hand  started bleeding but I couldn't care less. \n\n5 minutes had passed and I calmed down. I started to breath more easilly and gain some control on my body. I left the toilet and closed the door. I leaned against the wall and started to think. \"Did Josh saw this and ran? Did he get away\" I could only hope he was okay. Josh was a strong guy, and he was way more brave then I was. He's definitely okay. I walked back to the Ferris wheel to see if Josh there. And surprisngly, he was. \"Josh!\" I shouted. I finally found him. \"We need to get out of here. now!\" I said. \"Why?\" he said. '' Im so glad you're okay!\". \"Why?\" he said. \"The toilets\" I said. But Josh didn't understand. He was confused... it was like he didn't notice what was in that toilet. Which I found impossible. \"What are you talking about? \"      Somthing was wrong with Josh...\"Did you play?\" He said. I didn't move. Josh turned around and went to the Ferris wheel. He got on it and sat down. He stared at me. And I stared back at him. He didn't blink, he didn't move, godamnit he didn't do nothing except staring at me. But then I noticed something... Every time I blinked, his eyes got bigger. Blink after blink, it didn't stop. This was not Josh, it was somthing else. His eyes got so big they were no longer looking human. It was terryfing... I wanted to turn around but I couldn't. For some reason, I wanted to keep staring at Josh's eyes. He stareted laughing, it wasnt his luagh, it was distorted. He started coughing blood, while his eyes kept getting bigger. Until the point that Josh's eyes were bigger then his face. Then, he just stopped. I heard a whisper. \"He wanted to play. What about you? Do you wanna play?\".\n\nI screamed. I know that whatever this thing is, made Josh go crazy. I had to turn around, I had to see it. What is the thing that killed Josh. I slowely turned around and started to breath heavier. And then I saw it. It was Phil. Just standing there. But instead of being a small and cute doll, it was tall, dark and furious. Instead of smiling, he was angry. But his eyes didn't change. It didn't move, he just stood there in front of me. I started running away from this thing. I ran as fast as I could, trying to save my life. I looked behind me... But it still didn't move. But I didn't care. I climbed over the fence, and got on my bike. \n\nI started to ride back home. I was glad I survived, but I was sad for Josh. He deserved better, he shouldn't have die like this. And it was all because of me. Poor Josh... He was a good friend. I made my way home and opened the door. It was 2AM so my parents were asleep. I went to my bedroon. and closed the door.

I can do pictures of people just fine, and nature as well, but my true passion lies with abandoned buildings.\n\nThere\u2019s just something about them that draws me in.\n\nDesolate homes, ghost towns, and especially old and empty factories... Those places make for great photos... You can pretty much get insane pictures out of everything, from light falling in through broken glass to long abandoned machinery, looking almost like parts of an ancient civilization.\n\nHonestly, even if you don\u2019t have a camera or don\u2019t like taking pictures, walking around abandoned properties is a great way to find inspiration.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I would have said yesterday.\n\nToday... not so much.\n\nI found a new spot last week. An old factory, sitting empty since about 2010. I mean, according to the internet...\n\nWhen I stepped foot inside the first time, I thought I had hit the mother lode.\n\nDirt-caked, broken windows, creepers and moss everywhere, old, completely rusted machinery... It was an absolute dream come true.\n\nWell, that was, until I stepped onto what I thought was just a piece of old and weathered metal, then suddenly broke through.\n\nLuckily, I didn\u2019t fall too far.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I would have done if this old factory had a giant basement... probably broke my neck and died... but I fell about nine feet before I splashed into something I first thought was oil.\n\nOnly, it kinda stank like hell and was strangely warm...\n\nOf course, I jumped up, pulled my camera out of the stuff, and luckily found a small ladder right next to the part I had fallen through.\n\nThank fuck that piece of shit held my weight, otherwise, I would have taken the second tumble into that stuff, and I don\u2019t even want to know what would have happened to me then.\n\nAs things stood, I tried to wipe it off once I was above ground but had a hard time getting this stuff off my skin, so I stopped my outing then and there and headed back home.\n\nYou can probably imagine how pissed off I was.\n\nOh yeah, my camera won\u2019t turn on either, so I\u2019m pretty sure something is fried in there as well, but that\u2019s not my biggest problem, to be honest.\n\nI hopped in the shower and scrubbed myself, especially my hands, for close to half an hour before I felt even remotely clean again. That stench was something else, and the feeling of some thin sheen of oil sticking to my skin hasn\u2019t vanished even now.\n\nThe real problem began after, though.\n\nIt was evening and I was sitting in front of my camera, almost completely disassembled, trying to clean one tiny part after another with rubbing alcohol, but the progress was slow.\n\nThat was when that itch first started. I felt it on the back of my left hand.\n\nIt kinda reminded me of when I fell into some nettles or ivy as a child... More stinging than a mosquito bite and far smaller...\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe... like, imagine getting stung by hundreds of tiny mosquitoes, grouped together, all over your skin...\n\nAnd yeah, I realized then that when I fell into that hole, only my hands were completely unprotected...\n\nI couldn\u2019t continue cleaning my camera, that\u2019s how bad it got, even though I was wearing rubber gloves by then.\n\nMy first thought was that I had either fallen into something acidic or some kind of lye or the like... I went to the bathroom again, held my hands under the faucet, and watched the skin turn red while I switched up the temperature from almost scalding hot to as cold as it got.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help.\n\nNot really.\n\nThis itching, stinging sensation was somehow completely unaffected by the water now. And It felt like it was coming from under my skin.\n\nI groaned and scrubbed, but it didn\u2019t help at all. The only thing that changed was the color of my skin...\n\nIt was driving me mad... this sensation was running through both my hands and I couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything else. It was torturous. Bad enough that I honestly thought about getting out some steel wool...\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I stopped myself before I could go that far... I took some meds, but it didn\u2019t help, like, at all. So I rummaged around my workbench and found two things... rubbing alcohol and an old bottle of turpentine oil, I once used to remove paint from a piece of wood.\n\nFirst off, I know it\u2019s bad... you can get the shakes from using that on your skin... but I honestly didn\u2019t care about that back then... I couldn\u2019t... The itching, it was SO bad. Like millions of tiny insects crawling around the inside of my skin...\n\nI was panting and half-screaming as I took the oil with me into the bathroom, and then poured it over a part of my hand.\n\nIt felt like I was spilling lava onto my skin.\n\nThe pain was brutal enough to make me see stars, but after not even ten seconds, I suddenly felt the itch finally disappearing, and getting replaced by this dull tremor running through that part.\n\nNot thinking straight anymore, I poured the rest of the oil into the sink, then bit onto a towel and submerged both my hands in it.\n\nThe pain was blinding. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that before... I wasn\u2019t seeing stars, but my whole vision went bright white.\n\nMy hands were on fire and the sensation was shooting up my arms, through the shoulders, and back down into my chest. I feared I was having a heart attack from the agony and I think I blacked out since the next thing I remember is lying on the cold tiles of the bathroom, shaking like a leaf.\n\nBut the itch had stopped. Gone away completely. I felt this strange tremor in my hands, stood up, and washed them off with water once again.\n\nSome part of me feared that the itch would return, but thankfully, it didn\u2019t...\n\nWell... not immediately, at least...\n\nI felt exhausted, so I sat back down on the bathroom floor and kept looking at my hands. Slowly but surely, they were regaining their color, even if it still seemed a tiny bit off. A slight tremor was running through them, though I think... well, hope that was just from the stress.\n\nI must have nodded off, and I came to a few hours later, suddenly feeling a stinging pain in my fingers.\n\nMy fingertips felt raw and as I woke up I noticed that I had been scratching them against the rough caulk between the tiles. There were a few drops of blood smeared around now, and the sight woke me up in an instant.\n\nIt was back. This damned itch.\n\nOnly now, it wasn\u2019t all over my hands. Every spot I had submerged in the turpentine was okay...\n\nBut there are spots you can\u2019t reach like that.\n\nThe skin beneath my fingernails was itching so bad...\n\nEven in my sleep, I had subconsciously tried to scratch it.\n\nI closed my hands into fists and buried my nails into my palms, but it didn\u2019t help.\n\nIt won\u2019t stop...\n\nI\u2019ve tried everything.\n\nRubbing them against ice, holding them beneath hot water... I have salves and drops, I even did the turpentine bath again, but I can\u2019t get to it...\n\nThis itch, it\u2019s driving me up the walls.\n\nIt\u2019s beneath every single fingernail and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve started biting at the edges until they almost bleed... I nearly scratched through the nail of my thumb... it\u2019s red and raw...\n\nI can\u2019t go to the ER... I just can\u2019t...\n\nThere are small black spots on my ring finger, under the nail... I think they\u2019re forming there...\n\nIt almost looks like holes...\n\nShould I get the pliers?\n\nOr try and burn them?\n\nI don\u2019t want to lose my finger...\n\nOh God, I think I\u2019m going to be sick...\n\nPlease help me!\n\nPlease!"},"50":{"title":"There\u2019s Something Seriously Wrong with the Farms in Ireland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k703v7\/theres_something_seriously_wrong_with_the_farms\/","flair":null,"author":"CosmicOrphan2020","selftext":"Every summer when I was a child, my family would visit our relatives in the north-west of Ireland, in a rural, low-populated region called Donegal. Leaving our home in England, we would road trip through Scotland, before taking a ferry across the Irish sea. Driving a further three hours through the last frontier of the United Kingdom, my two older brothers and I would know when we were close to our relatives\u2019 farm, because the country roads would suddenly turn bumpy as hell.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDonegal is a breath-taking part of the country. Its Atlantic coast way is wild and rugged, with pastoral green hills and misty mountains. The villages are very traditional, surrounded by numerous farms, cow and sheep fields.\u00a0\n\nMy family and I would always stay at my grandmother\u2019s farmhouse, which stands out a mile away, due its bright, red-painted coating. These relatives are from my mother\u2019s side, and although Donegal \u2013 and even Ireland for that matter, is very sparsely populated, my mother\u2019s family is extremely large. She has a dozen siblings, which was always mind-blowing to me \u2013 and what\u2019s more, I have so many cousins, I\u2019ve yet to meet them all.\u00a0\n\nI always enjoyed these summer holidays on the farm, where I would spend every day playing around the grounds and feeding the different farm animals. Although I usually played with my two older brothers on the farm, by the time I was twelve, they were too old to play with me, and would rather go round to one of our cousin\u2019s houses nearby - to either ride dirt bikes or play video games. So, I was mostly stuck on the farm by myself.\u00a0Luckily, I had one cousin, Grainne, who lived close by and was around my age. Grainne was a tom-boy, and so we more or less liked the same activities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI absolutely loved it here,\u00a0and so did my brothers and my dad. In fact, we loved Donegal so much, we even talked about moving here. But, for some strange reason, although my mum was always missing her family, she was dead against any ideas of relocating. Whenever we asked her why, she would always have a different answer: there weren\u2019t enough jobs, it\u2019s too remote, and so on... But unfortunately for my mum, we always left the family decisions to a majority vote, and so, if the four out of five of us wanted to relocate to Donegal, we were going to.\u00a0\n\nOn one of these summer evenings on the farm, and having neither my brothers or Grainne to play with, my Uncle Dave - who ran the family farm, asks me if I\u2019d like to come with him to see a baby calf being born on one of the nearby farms. Having never seen a new-born calf before, I enthusiastically agreed to tag along. Driving for ten minutes down the bumpy country road, we pull outside the entrance of a rather large cow field - where, waiting for my Uncle Dave, were three other farmers. Knowing how big my Irish family was, I assumed I was probably related to these men too. Getting out of the car, these three farmers stare instantly at me, appearing both shocked and angry. Striding up to my Uncle Dave, one of the farmers yells at him, \u2018What the hell\u2019s this wain doing here?!\u2019\u00a0\n\nTaken back a little by the hostility, I then hear my Uncle Dave reply, \u2018He needs to know! You know as well as I do they can\u2019t move here!\u2019\u00a0\n\nFeeling rather uncomfortable by this confrontation, I was now somewhat confused. What do I need to know? And more importantly, why can\u2019t we move here?\u00a0\n\nBefore I can turn to Uncle Dave to ask him, the four men quickly halt their bickering and enter through the field gate entrance. Following the men into the cow field, the late-evening had turned dark by now, and not wanting to ruin my good trainers by stepping in any cowpats, I walked very cautiously and slowly \u2013 so slow in fact, I\u2019d gotten separated from my uncle's group. Trying to follow the voices through the darkness and thick grass, I suddenly stop in my tracks, because in front of me, staring back with unblinking eyes, was a very large cow \u2013 so large, I at first\u00a0mistook it for a bull. In the past, my Uncle Dave had warned me not to play\u00a0in the cow fields, because if cows are with their calves, they may charge\u00a0at you.\u00a0\n\nSeeing this huge cow, staring stonewall at me, I really was quite terrified \u2013 because already knowing how freakishly fast cows can be, I knew if it charged at me, there was little chance I would\u00a0outrun it. Thankfully, the cow stayed exactly where it was, before losing interest in me and moving on. I know it sounds ridiculous talking about my terrifying encounter with a cow, but I was a city boy after all. Although I regularly feds the cows on the family farm, these animals still felt somewhat alien to me, even after all these years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBrushing off my close encounter, I continue to try and find my Uncle Dave. I eventually found them on the far side of the field\u2019s corner. Approaching my uncle\u2019s group, I then see they\u2019re not alone. Standing by them were three more men and a woman, all dressed in farmer\u2019s clothing. But surprisingly, my cousin Grainne was also with them. I go over to Grainne to say hello, but she didn\u2019t even seem to realize I was there. She was too busy staring over at something, behind the group of farmers. Curious as to what Grainne was looking at, I move around to get a better look... and what I see is another cow \u2013 just a regular red cow, laying down on the grass. Getting out my phone to turn on the flashlight, I quickly realize this must be the cow that was giving birth. Its stomach was\u00a0swollen, and there were patches of blood stained on the grass around it... But then I saw something else...\u00a0\n\nOn the other side of this red cow, nestled in the grass beneath the bushes, was the calf... and rather sadly, it was stillborn... But what greatly concerned me, wasn\u2019t that this calf was dead. What concerned me was its appearance... Although the calf\u2019s head was covered in red, slimy fur, the rest of it wasn\u2019t... The rest of it didn\u2019t have any fur at all \u2013 just skin... And what made every single fibre of my body crawl, was that this calf\u2019s body \u2013 its brittle, infant body... It belonged to a human...\u00a0\n\nCurled up into a foetal position, its head was indeed that of a calf... But\u00a0what I should have been seeing as two front and hind legs,\u00a0were instead two human arms and legs - no longer or shorter than my own...\u00a0\n\nFeeling terrified and at the same time, in disbelief, I leave the calf, or whatever it was to go back to Grainne \u2013 all the while turning to shine my flashlight on the calf, as though to see if it still had the same appearance. Before I can make it back to the group of adults, Grainne stops me. With a look of concern on her face, she stares silently back at me, before she says, \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to be here. It was supposed to be a secret.\u2019\u00a0\n\nTelling her that Uncle Dave had brought me, I then ask what the hell that thing was... \u2018I\u2019m not allowed to tell you\u2019 she says. \u2018This was supposed to be a secret.\u2019\u00a0\n\nTwenty or thirty-so minutes later, we were all standing around as though waiting for something - before the lights of a vehicle pull into the field and a man gets out to come over to us. This man wasn\u2019t a farmer - he was some sort of veterinarian. Uncle Dave and the others bring him to tend to the calf\u2019s mother, and as he did, me and Grainne were made to wait inside one of the men\u2019s tractors.\u00a0\n\nWe sat inside the tractor for what felt like hours. Even though it was summer, the night was very cold, and I was only wearing a soccer jersey and shorts. I tried prying Grainne for more information as to what was going on, but she wouldn\u2019t\u00a0talk about it \u2013 or at least,\u00a0wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about it. Luckily, my determination for answers got the better of her, because more than an hour later, with nothing but the cold night air and awkward silence to accompany us both, Grainne finally gave in...\u00a0\n\n\u2018This happens every couple of years - to all the farms here... But we\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. It brings bad luck.\u2019\u00a0\n\nI then remembered something. When my dad said he wanted us to move here, my mum was dead against it. If anything, she looked scared just considering it... Almost afraid to know the answer, I work up the courage to ask Grainne... \u2018Does my mum know about this?\u2019\u00a0\n\nSat stiffly in the driver\u2019s seat, Grainne cranes her neck round to me. \u2018Of course she knows\u2019 Grainne reveals. \u2018Everyone here knows.\u2019\u00a0\n\nIt made sense now. No wonder my mum didn\u2019t want to move here. She never even seemed excited whenever we planned on visiting \u2013 which was strange to me, because my mum clearly loved her family.\u00a0\n\nI then remembered something else... A couple of years ago, I remember waking up in the middle of the night inside the farmhouse, and I could hear the cows on the farm screaming. The screaming was so bad, I couldn\u2019t even get back to sleep that night... The next morning, rushing through my breakfast to go play on the farm, Uncle Dave firmly tells me and my brothers to stay away from the cowshed... He didn\u2019t even give an explanation.\u00a0\n\nLater on that night, after what must have been a good three\u00a0hours, my Uncle Dave and the others come over to the tractor. Shaking Uncle Dave\u2019s hand, the veterinarian then gets in his vehicle and leaves out the field. I then notice two of the other farmers were carrying a black bag or something, each holding separate ends as they walked. I could see there was something heavy inside, and my first thought was they were carrying the dead calf \u2013 or whatever it was, away.\u00a0Appearing as though everyone was leaving now, Uncle Dave comes over to the tractor to say we\u2019re going back to the farmhouse, and that we would drop Grainne home along the way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHaving taken Grainne home, we then make our way back along the country road, where both me and Uncle Dave sat in complete silence. Uncle Dave driving, just staring at the stretch of road in front of us \u2013 and me, staring silently at him.\u00a0\n\nBy the time we get back to the farmhouse, it was two o\u2019clock in the morning \u2013 and the farm was dead silent. Pulling up outside the farm, Uncle Dave switches off the car engine. Without saying a word, we both remain in silence. I felt too awkward to ask him what I had just seen, but I knew he was waiting for me to do so. Still not saying a word to one another, Uncle Dave turns from the driver\u2019s seat to me... and he tells me everything Grainne wouldn\u2019t...\u00a0\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you see now why you can\u2019t move here?\u2019 he says. \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with this place, son. This place is cursed. Your mammy knows. She\u2019s known since she was a wain. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want you living here.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\u2018Why does this happen?\u2019 I ask him.\u00a0\n\n\u2018This has been happening for generations, son. For hundreds of years, the animals in the county have been giving birth to these things.\u2019 The way my Uncle Dave was explaining all this to me, it was almost like a confession \u2013 like he\u2019d wanted to tell the truth about what\u2019s been happening here all his life... \u2018It\u2019s not just the cows. It\u2019s the pigs. The sheep. The horses, and even the dogs\u2019...\u00a0\n\nThe dogs?\u00a0\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always the same. They have the head, as normal, but the body\u2019s always different.\u2019\u00a0\n\nIt was only now, after a long and terrifying night, that I suddenly started to become emotional - that and I was completely exhausted. Realizing this was all too much for a young boy to handle, I think my Uncle Dave tried to put my mind at ease...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you worry, son... They never live.\u2019\u00a0\n\nAlthough I wanted all the answers, I now felt as though I knew far too much... But there was one more thing I still wanted to know... What do they do with the bodies?\u00a0\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you worry about it, son. Just tell your mammy that you know \u2013 but don\u2019t go telling your brothers or your daddy now... She never wanted them knowing.\u2019\u00a0\n\nBy the next morning, and constantly rethinking everything that happened the previous night, I look around the farmhouse for my mum. Thankfully, she was alone in her bedroom folding clothes, and so I took the opportunity to talk to her in private. Entering her room, she asks me how it was seeing a calf being born for the first time. Staring back at her warm smile, my mouth opens to make words, but nothing comes out \u2013 and instantly... my mum knows what\u2019s happened.\u00a0\n\n\u2018I could kill your Uncle Dave!\u2019 she says. \u2018He said it was going to be a normal birth!\u2019\u00a0\n\nBreaking down in tears right in front of her, my mum comes over to comfort me in her arms.\u00a0\n\n\u2018\u2019It\u2019s ok, chicken. There\u2019s no need to be afraid.\u2019\u00a0\n\nAfter she tried explaining to me what Grainne and Uncle Dave had already told me, her comforting demeanour suddenly turns serious... Clasping her hands upon each side of my arms, my mum crouches down, eyes-level with me... and with the most serious look on her face I\u2019d ever seen, she demands of me, \u2018Listen chicken... Whatever you do, don\u2019t you dare go telling your brothers or your dad... They can never know. It\u2019s going to be our little secret. Ok?\u2019\u00a0\n\nStill with tears in my eyes, I nod a silent yes to her. \u2018Good man yourself\u2019 she says.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe went back home to England a week later... I never told my brothers or my dad the truth of what I saw \u2013 of what really happens on those farms... And I refused to ever step foot inside of County Donegal again...\u00a0\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing... I recently went back to Ireland, years later in my adulthood... and on my travels, I learned my mum and Uncle Dave weren\u2019t telling me the whole truth... \u00a0\n\nThis curse... It wasn\u2019t regional... And sometimes... \u00a0\n\n...They do live.\u00a0"},"52":{"title":"I think I saw a surveillance test or something?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k6nn4j\/i_think_i_saw_a_surveillance_test_or_something\/","flair":null,"author":"SoniaStalks","selftext":"I\u2019m not posting this for attention.

The stories about this place had always intrigued me\u2014whispers of experiments that blurred the line between science and horror. The building itself was suffocating, its long-forgotten corridors filled with decaying walls and a silence that pressed down like a weight.\n\nWhile poking through the rubble, my flashlight beam caught something unusual: a dusty VHS tape half-buried under debris. It was old and worn, the label on it faded except for the clear, bold numbers: **\u201c013.\u201d** My curiosity overpowered my unease. I pocketed the tape and left the building, the chill of the place lingering on my skin.\n\nThe next day, I bought a VHS player. Something about that tape demanded answers, and I wasn\u2019t going to let it sit idle. For an extra thrill, I decided to return to the building where I found it and play it there.\n\nThe sun was setting as I approached the structure. Shadows stretched across the windows, and I swear I saw something\u2014a figure, motionless, staring at me from the second floor. My pulse quickened, but I reasoned it was just my imagination. Brushing it off, I stepped inside and set up the VHS player.\n\nThe tape started with static, a hiss filling the room. Then, voices:\u201cAre you ready, 013?\u201d\u201cI want out,\u201d a deep, guttural voice replied, each word laced with malice.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get started\u2014wait, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d came the reply, the tone now entirely inhuman.\n\nChaos followed\u2014shouts, crashes, and screams. A screeching sound, unlike anything I\u2019d ever heard, pierced the air before the tape abruptly ended.\n\nBut the nightmare wasn\u2019t over. Above me, from the same window where I\u2019d seen the shadow, came the unmistakable sound of footsteps. Slow, deliberate. Then, another screech\u2014this time, not from the tape. The sound was identical, but real, and it was coming closer.\n\nI didn\u2019t wait to find out what was behind it. I grabbed my things and ran, not stopping until I was back in my car.\n\n\n\nThat night, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every creak of the house made me jump. Around midnight, I heard something I couldn\u2019t ignore: footsteps. This time, they weren\u2019t above the second floor\u2014they were in my attic.\n\nGrabbing my gun and flashlight, I called my buddy, who thankfully agreed to come over armed as well. Together, we climbed the ladder to the attic, the cold air biting at our skin.\n\nThe space was suffocating, the silence almost tangible. As our flashlights scanned the room, I noticed scratches on the wooden beams\u2014deep gouges, as if something had clawed its way through. My stomach churned.\n\nThen came the screech. It was deafening, echoing off the walls and freezing us in place. From the far corner of the attic, something moved. My flashlight caught a glimpse\u2014a grotesque figure with glowing eyes, its skeletal frame and twisted limbs unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cShoot it!\u201d I yelled, and we both opened fire. The thing screeched again, retreating into the shadows. We didn\u2019t wait to see where it went. We scrambled down the ladder, out the door, and into the safety of the night.\n\nOnce outside, we called 911, barely able to explain what had happened. The operator\u2019s skepticism was clear, but they promised to send someone over.\n\n\n\nWe knew we couldn\u2019t stay at the house, so we packed what we could and left. On the way out, we stopped at a neighbor\u2019s house to ask if they could keep an eye on things. As he agreed, I noticed something strange: a small tattoo on his wrist that read **\u201c013.\u201d** He noticed me staring and quickly covered it, offering a vague excuse.\n\nShaking off the unease, we drove to a nearby hotel. By the time we arrived, exhaustion was catching up with us. We checked into our room, triple-locked the door, and inspected every corner. The room seemed normal, but the tension was suffocating.\n\nAfter settling in, we decided to run to the store to grab dinner. When we returned, we froze in the doorway. Sitting in the middle of the room was the VHS player, the same tape inside.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d my friend whispered, his voice shaking.\n\nWe immediately called the police, telling them everything: the tape, the attic, the creature, and now this. Two officers arrived within the hour. They listened, but their skepticism was clear.\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see this tape,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\n\nThis time, the tape began differently. A timestamp appeared: **1\/13\/1994.**\u201cSubject 013: Experimental Cognitive Variance,\u201d a voice announced.\n\nThe audio crackled, and screams erupted. A younger voice, presumably 013, pleaded for release. The sound of electric buzzing followed, growing louder. Suddenly, a crash\u2014metal restraints breaking.\n\n\u201cRestraints breached!\u201d someone yelled. Chaos erupted. The audio captured the sounds of bodies being thrown against walls, panicked screams, and desperate commands:\u201cSECURITY! Get him back in the\u2014\u201d\n\nA guttural, otherworldly screech drowned out the voices, and the tape cut to static.\n\nThe officers exchanged uneasy glances. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d one of them said, reaching to eject the tape.\n\nBut then, the room went cold. The lights flickered, and a low growl filled the air. From the shadows, the creature emerged\u2014its glowing eyes and skeletal frame unmistakable.**I\u2019m Schizophrenic but I know what I saw was real.**\n\nThree nights ago, I decided to explore an abandoned building near the infamous Montauk Project site. The stories about this place had always intrigued me\u2014whispers of experiments that blurred the line between science and horror. The building itself was suffocating, its long-forgotten corridors filled with decaying walls and a silence that pressed down like a weight.\n\nWhile poking through the rubble, my flashlight beam caught something unusual: a dusty VHS tape half-buried under debris. It was old and worn, the label on it faded except for the clear, bold numbers: **\u201c013.\u201d** My curiosity overpowered my unease. I pocketed the tape and left the building, the chill of the place lingering on my skin.\n\nThe next day, I bought a VHS player. Something about that tape demanded answers, and I wasn\u2019t going to let it sit idle. For an extra thrill, I decided to return to the building where I found it and play it there.\n\nThe sun was setting as I approached the structure. Shadows stretched across the windows, and I swear I saw something\u2014a figure, motionless, staring at me from the second floor. My pulse quickened, but I reasoned it was just my imagination. Brushing it off, I stepped inside and set up the VHS player.\n\nThe tape started with static, a hiss filling the room. Then, voices:\u201cAre you ready, 013?\u201d\u201cI want out,\u201d a deep, guttural voice replied, each word laced with malice.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get started\u2014wait, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d came the reply, the tone now entirely inhuman.\n\nChaos followed\u2014shouts, crashes, and screams. A screeching sound, unlike anything I\u2019d ever heard, pierced the air before the tape abruptly ended.\n\nBut the nightmare wasn\u2019t over. Above me, from the same window where I\u2019d seen the shadow, came the unmistakable sound of footsteps. Slow, deliberate. Then, another screech\u2014this time, not from the tape. The sound was identical, but real, and it was coming closer.\n\nI didn\u2019t wait to find out what was behind it. I grabbed my things and ran, not stopping until I was back in my car."},"55":{"title":"The Devil Inside The Paint","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k5pvkw\/the_devil_inside_the_paint\/","flair":null,"author":"East-Ad5704","selftext":"He sat alone in his apartment.

But something is wrong with my best friend, Jake. Really wrong. And I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSo, Jake and I have been best friends since we were twelve. We\u2019re 20 now. He\u2019s always been a bit weird\u2014dark sense of humor, into horror, that kind of thing\u2014but lately\u2026 it\u2019s like he\u2019s a totally different person.\n\nIt started a few weeks ago. We were hanging out at his place, just playing some games, when he paused mid-match and looked at me with this blank stare.\n\n\u201cYou ever think about what it\u2019d be like to wear someone else?\u201d he asked.\n\nI laughed, thinking he meant metaphorically. Like, empathy or whatever. But then he said:\n\n\u201cNo, I mean like literally. Stepping into their skin. Their bones. Would anyone notice?\u201d\n\nI stared at him, waiting for the punchline, but he just blinked slowly and turned back to the game like nothing happened.\n\nThat was the first time I got this weird chill around him.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s only gotten worse. He\u2019ll say something completely out of character\u2014like talking about my childhood dog, Max, who died when we were ten. Except\u2026 I never told him about Max. Ever. That was before we met. I asked him how he knew, and he just said:\n\n\u201cI remember more than you think.\u201d\n\nI tried brushing it off. Maybe he saw a photo or heard it from someone else. But then I noticed something else: Jake doesn\u2019t blink like normal anymore. He\u2019ll just stare at me, unblinking, for minutes. Like he's studying me.\n\nThree days ago, he showed up at my apartment unannounced. I was in the shower, and when I stepped out, he was just\u2026 sitting on my bed. Smiling.\n\n\u201cI made a copy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA better version. Less doubt. Less fear. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHe left without explaining. No texts, no calls. Just gone.\n\nUntil tonight.\n\nI just got home from work. My apartment was dark, but something felt off\u2014you know that gut feeling that tells you you\u2019re not alone? Yeah. That.\n\nI turned on the lights and everything looked normal, until I saw the mirror in my hallway.\n\nThere were two sets of wet footprints on the hardwood floor. Both leading in.\n\nAnd in the mirror\u2026 it was me.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe reflection smiled first.\n\nThen it moved when I didn\u2019t.\n\nI turned around\u2014nothing there.\n\nBut I just got a text from Jake. The real Jake. The number is different, unlisted.\n\nAll it says is:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust the one that calls you \u2018buddy.\u2019 That\u2019s how it starts.\u201d\n\nGuess what the thing in my living room just called me when I walked past?\n\n\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m locking myself in my room.

We really wanna live together, but we are just waiting for our unis to finish so we can get a proper job.\n\nThis time, she was coming to Japan to see me, I was just chilling at my house at the time, and she called me saying that she was close, and then I brushed my hair and changed clothes to see her, I was with a jeans jacket with my pocket sketchbook and phone in it, then she called me. We started smilling to each other in the video call, and she said that she was already walking up the stairs to see me, so I said I was going to walk down the stairs to kiss her, so we both were walking the stairs with out smartphones on hand.\n\nBut, I walked all the way down and didn't see her, while she walked all the way up to my front door, and didn't see me, weird, I aksed if she didn't enter the other building instead of mine, and no, she was exactly at my front door on her camera. So I just ran back up to my house to meet her.\n\nWe hugged and kissed and she was carring her big backpack in her bag, I took it from her and opened the door so she could walk in, she as cute as always walked in smilling, but something felt off, my house was off somehow, but I didn't notice anything strange, just felt off. Later remembering it, when we came to my room, I saw a big mirror reflecting the corner of the room, this mirror wasn't there before, but I didn't feel weird about it at first, it was just unerving.\n\nMy girlfriend was cuddling with me at my bed, then she said she wanted to drink some water, so she went to take it. I was in my room while I head she talking to herself, like I was there with her, but I was dissociating a bit because of the mirror, everything was so weird, I started to feel eerie about everything, it was like I was loosing trust in my senses, and what the heck was that mirror doing in my room? Whose voice was that in the kitchen with her? I just stood up, took my jacket and walked at her.\n\n\"There is something wrong happening, we need to leave. Now.\" She looked confused at me and asked \"What u talking about, silly?\" And I answered very serious \"We really need to leave, there is something strange happening here.\".\n\nShe was still confused, and I don't blame her, but she started picking her stuff up. I put on my shoes and holded the door to her on my way out, and while she was putting on her shoes, I could see the mirror from my point of view, it was still pointing at the corner of the room, but there was nothing there, while she was finishing putting on her shoe, from the mirror I saw her peek at me, smile, and wave, and vanished again in the mirror.\n\nIt was terrifying, it was exactly her in the mirror, but it didn't make any sense, I looked at her and she saw my face. \"What did you see?\" she asked me, starting to get a little scared. \"I saw you in the mirror, smiling at me while we leave.\" She knew I was being serious, I closed the door behind us, and we started walking down the stairs of the building, while I was leaving, I noticed that the lights from the building were a little pinkier, just a small detail, the white light was slightly pinkier.\n\nShe didn't really ask, or talked to me while we were walking away from the building, until we reached the usual streets and a small park that had around where I lived.\n\n\"You ok?\" I asked. \"Yeah, what happend? You was just in the kitchen with me, and then we where leaving the house. This is not funny, you're scaring the shit out of me.\" She was getting upset, and I noticed that she was sweating a little, I don't know why but it was hot outside, like really hot. I cleaned her forehead and explained everything to her, while we were sitting in the park under a tree.\n\nWe started noticing kids wearing towels arond their necks, something that is usual especially in summer in Japan, tank tops, shorts and towels, and then Catie( little cutie nickname) took of her jacket. \"What do we do now?\" she asked. I just didn't now what to say, was it all real? I took my phone to see the temperature, 28 \u00b0C... but around that time of the year, which was April, the temperature shoudn't be that high... Then I looked at the date next to the temperature. July 25th... 2023. Everything was just getting weirder and weirder. I showed it to her.\n\nShe looked at me in shock. \"It doesn't make sense\", I saw her getting anxious, breathing faster, when I was going to hold her hand, something pulled me from behind, my vision was getting blury.\n\nI was in my room again.\n\nThe same place from when she went to the kitchen.\n\nI heard a lot of noise coming from the front door, I was so fucked up, I didn't know what to do, and a terrible headache, ears ringing. And then, the noise stopped, a familiar voice came from the front door, my parent were back from the groceries. I went on to talk to them, I started to try and explain what was happening to them, and they just looked and me and said \"Are you an idiot? I can't understand anything that you're saying.\"\n\nI just ignored them, and took my phone out to see if I still could talk to Catie, and the date was just the same, first thing that I noticed, April 22... 2024. The same day it was when she first called me from downstairs. What whas happening?? Somehow I could call her, but the call was just horrible, the image was terrible, but somehow we could still talk to each other, she said that she was fine, and that I just vanished in front of her, like in a blink of an eye.\n\nAt this point we were just trying to figure something out, on how to be toghether again, and bring her back to the actual time. So while in call with her I told her to meet me in front of the building, before I left I took the jacket again, the mirror wasn't in my room anymore, and neither my parents were home anymore, I litereally just saw them, but anyways I started heading downstairs.\n\nWhen I started heading downstairs I noticed the lights changing just a little bit to that weird pinky white from before, so instead of keep heading downstairs, I started walking back up. I went to my door and checked the house... The mirror was there.\n\nCatie later told me that when I was heading downstairs, she just saw me appear from one floor to another, and then started heading up again, she also said that all our messages were giving an error in her phone, something like \"Can't open messages from recent version of the app, update it to see new messages.\".\n\nGetting back to the mirror, I just closed the door as fast as I could, I didn't want to look at it anymore, and ran down the stairs, but when I was heading down the stairs, the pink light started to get to the normal color again, so I stopped and looked down, Catie wasn't there anymore, and she said I vanished again in between floors. So I tryied something.\n\nI went back up, opened and closed the door, no mirror there btw, and then started running back down again, and she saw me. We hugged so strong, I can even remember her warmth from that hug, then I asked her to hold my hand and don't turn off the phone call, she held my hand very strongly, like she wanted to break my fingers, I could tell how scared she was, me too, at least I felt safer with her again.\n\nSo we started walking upstairs together, and I saw the lights change again, normal tone, I turned off our call and we got back again in front of my front door, while still holding her hand, I opened the door.\n\nNo mirror.\n\nParents talking in the kitchen.\n\nSight of realief from both of us, so we just went back to my room, together, and held hands for a while, still processing all that happened, she smiled at me.

Outside, the wind howled through the pines, a mournful sound that made the old timber frame creak and groan. The blizzard had been raging for two days now, and there was no sign of it letting up.\n\nGrandfather leaned forward in his rocking chair, his weathered face illuminated by the dancing flames. Across from him, his grandson Tommy sat cross-legged on the bearskin rug, wide-eyed and eager. Behind Grandfather, his shadow stretched against the wall.\n\n\"You sure you want to hear this story, boy? It's not for the faint of heart.\" Grandfather's voice was like gravel underfoot, worn smooth by years and whiskey.\n\nTommy nodded eagerly. \"I'm twelve now, Grandpa. I'm not scared.\"\n\n\"Twelve is a good age,\" Grandfather nodded once. \"Strong enough to hear hard truths.\" He took a long sip from his steaming mug. \"Time you learned about the Wendigo.\"\n\n\"The monster from the stories?\" Tommy's voice betrayed a hint of nervousness despite his bravado.\n\n\"Not just stories. The Wendigo is real.\" Grandfather's eyes caught the firelight, reflecting it strangely. \"I've met it more than once. Escaped by luck and nothing else.\" He leaned closer. \"Want to hear about it?\"\n\nTommy nodded, pulling his blanket tighter around his shoulders.\n\n\"Alright then. But remember this-it listens. It watches. Even now.\" Grandfather glanced toward the window, where snow pelted against the glass like tiny desperate fists. \"Especially in storms.\"\n\nGrandfather settled deeper into his chair, his eyes growing distant as he sank into memories. The cabin seemed to grow quieter, as if the very walls were leaning in to listen.\n\n\"The most recent time was about fifteen years ago, before you were born. I was working as a forest ranger up near the Canadian border. Beautiful country, but lonely. My cabin was the only human dwelling for twenty miles in any direction.\n\n\"Winter came early that year. By late October, we were already snowed in. Supply drops came by helicopter once a month, but a storm rolled in just when I was expecting a drop. Radio communication went down too. I was completely cut off.\n\n\"After a couple days, my food was running low. The weather was still too bad for supplies. That's when I first noticed the tracks outside my cabin-like deer hooves, but larger, deeper. They circled the entire perimeter, as if something had been pacing, looking for a way in.\n\n\"That night, I heard knocking at my door. Three slow, deliberate knocks.\n\n\"'Hello?' called a voice. 'Is anyone there? I'm a hiker. I got lost in the storm.'\n\n\"Now, I knew that wasn't possible. No hiker could have made it through that blizzard, and the nearest trail was miles away. But the voice-there was something about it that pulled at me. Something familiar I couldn't quite place.\n\n\"'I can see your chimney smoke,' the voice called. 'Please, I'm freezing out here.'\n\n\"Something felt wrong. The voice was too calm for someone who'd been wandering in a blizzard. But even stranger-it seemed to know things it shouldn't. 'I can see you sitting by your radio,' it said. 'The one with the broken antenna. I can help fix it.'\n\n\"I hadn't told anyone about the broken antenna. Hadn't had a chance to.\n\n\"I approached the window instead, thinking I'd get a look before deciding. The temperature in the cabin plummeted. My breath clouded before my face, and the fire dimmed as if starved for air.\n\n\"Through the frost-covered glass, I could make out a figure in the moonlight. A man in hiking gear, his back to me, looking out at the forest. As if sensing my gaze, he began to turn.\n\n\"I ducked away before seeing his face. Some instinct warned me not to look. In the window's reflection, I glimpsed something tall behind the hiker-something with a crown of shadows that moved like antlers.\n\n\"'I know you're in there,' the voice said, suddenly right at the window. 'Why won't you help me?'\n\n\"I sat with my back against the wall, beneath the windowsill, heart pounding. 'The ranger station is two miles south,' I lied. 'Follow the trail markers with reflectors.'\n\n\"Silence followed. Then came a sound I'll never forget-a soft laugh that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The air filled with a scent like frozen pine needles and something else, something metallic and ancient.\n\n\"'But you're here,' the voice said, softer now. 'And I'm so hungry.'\n\n\"All night it stayed outside, sometimes knocking, sometimes calling in different voices-a woman, a child, an old man. Always knowing details it shouldn't: the titles of books on my shelf, where I kept my spare keys, the name of my childhood dog. By dawn, the noises stopped. When I finally looked outside, the strange tracks were gone, filled in by fresh snow. But at the edge of the clearing stood a single birch tree that hadn't been there the day before.\n\n\"The storm broke that afternoon. A helicopter came with supplies the next day. I never told anyone what happened. Who would believe me?\"\n\nTommy stared at the window, as if expecting to see something there. The fire popped suddenly, making him jump. Outside, the wind seemed to pause, as if listening.\n\n\"But you'd seen it before?\" Tommy asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nGrandfather's eyes grew distant again. The lines in his face deepened as he nodded slowly. \"Yes.\" He took a slow breath before continuing, rolling back the years with each word. \"It finds those who are alone in the wild. And it's patient... so very patient.\"\n\nHis gaze focused on something far beyond the cabin walls. \"I was in my thirties, back in the 1970s. I worked for a nature magazine, traveling to remote places to take photographs. That particular winter, I was assigned to capture the northern lights in the Minnesota wilderness.\n\n\"The editor wanted something special-aurora borealis reflecting off pristine, untouched snow. No cabins, no roads, nothing man-made in the frame. Just pure wilderness under those dancing lights. The kind of shot that makes you feel tiny in the universe.\n\n\"I packed enough supplies for two weeks and hired a bush pilot to drop me at a remote lake thirty miles from the nearest town. The pilot thought I was crazy going alone in January.\n\n\"'Radio check-in every night at seven,' he insisted. 'Miss two in a row, and I'm coming to get you, pictures be damned.'\n\n\"The first few days were magical. Complete solitude. The silence of those woods-you can't imagine it, Tommy. Not silence like an empty room. Silence like the world before humans existed. I'd spend all day scouting locations, then set up my cameras at dusk and wait through the frigid nights for the lights to appear.\n\n\"On the fourth night, the aurora was spectacular-curtains of green and purple rippling across the stars. I was moving between my three camera setups when I noticed something odd. A dark patch in the snow about a hundred yards out on the frozen lake. I was certain it hadn't been there during my setup.\n\n\"Through my telephoto lens, I could just make out a figure standing perfectly still. A person, facing away from shore, looking up at the sky.\n\n\"My first thought was relief-another photographer! Even brief company would have been welcome after days alone. I called out, but my voice seemed swallowed by the vastness. The sound traveled wrong, as if the words froze before they could reach across the ice.\n\n\"I decided to approach. The ice was thick enough to hold a truck this time of year, so I wasn't worried about that. But with each step I took toward the figure, the temperature dropped noticeably. My eyelashes began to frost over. And something felt increasingly wrong. It never moved, not even slightly. No shifting of weight, no turning at the sound of my crunching footsteps. And strangest of all-no breath cloud in the bitter air.\n\n\"About halfway across the lake, I stopped. Some primal instinct told me to go no farther. I raised my camera instead and took a series of photographs with my flash.\n\n\"The figure still didn't turn, but it... changed somehow. Even from behind, I could tell its proportions were wrong-too tall now, too thin, its head oddly shaped.\n\n\"A cloud passed over the moon, plunging the lake into momentary darkness. When moonlight returned, the figure was gone. The dark patch in the snow remained.\n\n\"I retreated to my tent, heart pounding. For hours, I heard footsteps circling-sometimes near, sometimes far, but always returning. The air in my tent filled with that same scent-frozen pine and something older, something that didn't belong in this century. Toward dawn, the footsteps stopped directly outside my tent. Then came a soft voice, barely above a whisper.\n\n\"'Your cameras are still out there. Don't you want to collect them before the snow comes?'\n\n\"I remained silent, paralyzed with fear.\n\n\"'I've seen what you're trying to capture,' the voice continued. 'But your photographs will never show the true beauty of this place. I could show you perspectives you've never imagined.'\n\n\"The voice was gentle, almost hypnotic. Despite my terror, I found myself reaching for the tent zipper.\n\n\"A sudden gust of wind shook the tent, breaking the spell. I huddled in my sleeping bag until sunrise, radio clutched to my chest, too frightened even to call for help.\n\n\"In the morning, I found my cameras untouched. Around my tent were those distinctive tracks-like deer hooves but impossibly large and deep. They led to each camera, lingered, then continued to my tent before disappearing into the treeline.\n\n\"When I developed the film later, every shot of the northern lights showed the same thing: a tall, antlered silhouette at the frame's edge, just barely visible against the stars. In each sequential photo, it was closer to the camera position. In the final frame, it stood directly behind the tripod, its elongated shadow stretching toward the lens.\n\n\"The strangest photo, though, was one I didn't remember taking. A self-portrait, apparently triggered by the timer, showing me standing at the lake's edge, looking out at the ice. Behind me, half-hidden in shadow, stood something impossibly tall with a hand-not quite a hand-reaching toward my shoulder. But what truly chilled me was my own expression in the photo-serene, almost joyful, as if I was about to step into an embrace.\n\n\"I never showed those photos to anyone. But I keep them still, as a reminder of what waits in the wilderness for those who wander too far alone.\"\n\nTommy's eyes were wide now, his earlier bravado gone. \"Can I see the photos?\"\n\nGrandfather's expression softened strangely. \"Sure. Once we're home.\"\n\nTommy shifted under his blanket, suddenly cold despite the fire's warmth. A silence settled between them, filled only by the soft popping of the fire and the distant moan of the wind. The grandfather's eyes lingered on the boy's face, studying his reaction as if searching for something.\n\n\"There was another time,\" Grandfather said finally, his voice lower now, almost reverent. \"Earlier still, when I was younger than your father is now.\" He leaned back, his silhouette merging with the shadows behind him. \"Each encounter was different, you see. It learns. It adapts. But it always hungers.\"\n\n\"I had taken a job as a fur trapper to save money for college. I had a line of traps spanning several miles through the northern woods.\n\n\"One December day, a blizzard blew in while I was checking my far traps. I knew I wouldn't make it back to my cabin before nightfall, so I headed for an old emergency shelter that the previous trapper had built-just a small shack with a woodstove.\n\n\"The wind had a voice that day. Not just howling, but something more articulate, almost like words just beyond understanding. I kept looking over my shoulder, feeling watched, though nothing was visible through the thickening snow.\n\n\"I was about a mile from the shelter when I noticed someone walking ahead of me on the trail-another trapper by the look of him, hunched against the wind. The sight of him was strange, though. In such a whiteout, he should have been a barely visible silhouette, but I could see him with unusual clarity, as if he existed separately from the storm around him.\n\n\"'Hello there!' I called, but my voice was lost in the wind.\n\n\"I tried to catch up, but no matter how fast I walked, he remained the same distance ahead, always just visible enough to follow. It struck me as odd that I never got closer, but I was grateful for the company and the broken trail through deepening snow.\n\n\"He led me straight to the shelter. When I arrived, the door was ajar, but there was no one inside. No footprints led away from the door either-just my own tracks arriving, and those I had followed, which mysteriously ended at the threshold.\n\n\"Inside, I found the woodstove already lit and warm, a pot of stew bubbling on top. A single wooden chair was pulled up to the small table, as if awaiting a guest. On the table sat a pocket watch I recognized immediately-it had belonged to my grandfather. I'd left it at home, a hundred miles away.\n\n\"The air in the shelter smelled different from the snow outside-older, earthier, with that same metallic undertone I'd come to recognize years later.\n\n\"I was starving and cold, so despite my unease, I sat and ate. The stew was unlike anything I'd tasted-rich and satisfying in a way that seemed to warm me from the inside out. I emptied the pot and promptly fell into the deepest sleep of my life.\n\n\"I dreamed of running through the forest on four legs, tireless and free, under a full moon. Of knowing every shadow and hollow of the woods as intimately as the lines on my own palm. In the dream, I wasn't alone-there were others running with me, their forms shifting between human and something else entirely.\n\n\"When I woke the next morning, the blizzard had passed. The woodstove was cold, as if it hadn't been lit in weeks. The pot was gone, and in its place lay a small, yellowed human tooth.\n\n\"I left immediately, abandoning my traps and gear. When I finally made it back to town and asked about the previous trapper who'd used that shelter, the old-timers fell silent. Eventually, one told me he'd disappeared ten years earlier during a winter storm. 'The woods claimed him,' was all they would say.\"\n\n\"Strange thing was,\" Grandfather added, his voice dropping to a near whisper, \"when I got home, I found my grandfather's pocket watch exactly where I'd left it. But when I opened it, the glass was foggy, as if it had been out in the cold. And inside the case was a single, small pine needle that hadn't been there before.\"\n\nTommy shivered, but he leaned closer, captivated.\n\n\"You understand, don't you?\" Grandfather asked softly. \"You feel it too-the call of the winter woods.\"\n\nTommy hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Sometimes... sometimes I dream about running through snow. But I'm not scared in the dreams. I feel... free.\"\n\nGrandfather's smile deepened. \"Of course you do. The wild is freeing.\"\n\nGrandfather fell silent, staring into the fire. Outside, the wind had died down, as if the storm itself was listening, waiting for the final tale.\n\n\"More?\" Tommy asked quietly, his voice small yet eager despite the fear that had crept into it. Something in his eyes reflected his grandfather's gaze-a curiosity that ran deeper than caution.\n\n\"One last story,\" Grandfather said, his tone changing, as if he were speaking from a place more primal than memory. \"The first time.\"\n\n\"I was eight years old,\" he began, his clipped style softening slightly. \"Lived in a small house at the edge of town. My bedroom window faced the woods.\"\n\n\"One winter night, I woke to tapping on my window. Like fingernails on glass. I was scared, but curiosity pulled stronger. I looked through the curtains.\"\n\n\"In the moonlight stood Billy Mercer, a boy from my school. He'd gone missing three days earlier during a family camping trip.\"\n\n\"'Let me in,' he said. His breath didn't fog the glass despite the cold. 'I've been lost in the woods. Found my way back, but my parents aren't home.'\"\n\n\"Something was wrong. His eyes reflected the moonlight like an animal's. His clothes were too clean-the same ones from when he disappeared.\"\n\n\"I told him I'd wake my parents so they could call his family.\"\n\n\"'No,' he said sharply. 'Don't wake them. Just let me in. I'm cold.'\"\n\n\"He pressed his hand against the glass. His fingers were too long, the joints bent strangely.\"\n\n\"I backed away. His face changed then-not angry, but deeply sad. Like he'd lost something precious.\"\n\n\"'Don't you want to play in the woods with me?' he asked. 'I've found the most wonderful places.'\n\n\"As he spoke, I caught my own reflection in the glass, overlaying his face. For just a moment, we blended together.\n\n\"I ran for my parents. When they checked, nothing was there-just strange tracks in the snow.\n\n\"Next day at school, they announced they'd found Billy's coat. Never found Billy himself.\n\n\"When spring came and snow melted, hikers found a cave in the forest. Inside were children's things arranged like a tea party. My jacket was there too. But I'd never lost it.\"\n\nGrandfather's eyes seemed to look inward. \"Sometimes, I still see him. In still water. In dark windows. Watching.\"\n\nThe fire had burned low. The cabin felt cold now.\n\nTommy's blanket pulled tight. \"Why do we come here every winter?\"\n\n\"To remember.\" Grandfather's smile didn't reach his eyes.\n\nHe added a log to the fire. Flames lit his face different now. Tommy saw the deep shadows in his grandfather's eyes. How they caught light but didn't hold it.\n\n\"The forest is a lonely place,\" Grandfather said, words sparse like the trees in snow. \"Cold. Silent. Vast.\"\n\nHe stood with strange grace. Moved to the window. His outline against the glass seemed wrong somehow. Too tall. Too angular.\n\n\"Those stories are true.\" His voice held echoes. Other voices beneath. \"But the endings might not be.\"\n\nTommy watched his grandfather's hands. Had his fingers always been that long? That oddly bent?\n\nHe turned to Tommy, hand extended. \"You hear them too. The woods calling.\"\n\nOutside, the snow had stopped. The pines stood dark and waiting.\n\nThe fire burned out. Shadows danced on walls. Like antlers.\n\nBy morning, fresh tracks led away from the cabin door-one set large and strange, the other small and human, walking side by side into the endless white of the winter woods."},"67":{"title":"Red light in my mirror","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k0rb1w\/red_light_in_my_mirror\/","flair":null,"author":"Choice-Progress-7077","selftext":"\nShort story I am working on for a creative writing class, not done yet. Any advice is appreciated, I\u2019m not a great writer.\n\n\nThe world is black, I am in a man\u2019s room, it looks like my room, but who knows. The line between dream and reality is blurred. The man is sleeping, or am I sleeping? I see a figure exit from the shadows of who knows where, going to the man in bed. The man is unaware. Am I the one in the bed? The intruder slowly puts its hands around the man\u2019s neck, and I feel my throat close up. I scream to warn the man, just as I scream the man screams as well. He must have woken. From the other side of the bed that was covered by the shadows, a woman emerges. Maybe his wife?  Maybe my wife? The woman shakes the man, and my vision goes fuzzy.\n\n I open my eyes and I am greeted with harsh light and my wife shaking me. \u201cIt happened again,\u201d she said, looking shaken up. I nod slowly, trying to remember what happened, but nothing comes to mind. All I feel is raw, deep fear and I don\u2019t know why. I apologize to my wife, promising I\u2019ll get help, I never do though, and I think by now she knows that. \n\nSome time has passed and my wife has fallen back asleep, I can hear her snoring softly. Careful not to wake her I get up and go to the bathroom. Shutting the door behind me, I see a weird glow from the mirror. I turn on the light and the glow disappears, just like every night for the past 3 weeks. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I don\u2019t think of it too much, my wife says I am just seeing things. I look in the mirror and see dark red marks on my neck, suddenly I feel this tingling sensation and my blood suddenly goes cold, it\u2019s like I feel it all over again, but I don\u2019t know what I am feeling. Hands are on my throat now, but I know they really aren\u2019t, it\u2019s all in my head I tell myself, splashing cold water on my face, but deep down inside, I don\u2019t think it is. \n\n\tMy wife is out with friends, I had to do some paperwork. I\u2019m alone, but I don\u2019t feel alone, there\u2019s something greater in this house, and I feel it even more now. It is nighttime, and it is dark. When I see the sunset I always go to look at the light in the mirror, tonight was no different. Just as I knew it would be, the light was there, seeming bigger than before. My heart is pulsing, and I think my head is going to explode. I reached for the advil on the counter, but hit my head on the corner of the mirror. \n\n\tMy head splits and I feel my brain explode out on the bathroom counter, oozing on the linoleum tile. My wife always hated that ugly red tile. We were going to replace it, but we never did. \n\nI am out of my body now and I want to scream, but I can\u2019t. How can I scream when my entire face blew up, when I can see my brain spilling everywhere. When my eyeballs are melting and my face morphs into something hideous. \n\nI try to breathe. Breathe. Breath. Breath. I get like this. So many times. I wanted to be a doctor once. Make my family proud. I was in an anatomy class, dissecting a real body, but that was my body. I was watching a man dissect his own body, my body. The smell of formaldehyde was lingering on me for weeks, but no one believed me.  I am not cut out for the medical field. Not when I see myself getting cut out. \n\n\tAfter what feels like hours and lifetimes and also just seconds, the only man I see is the one looking back at me across the sink, the cracked mirror darkening his features. The red light switches on and off, testing me, teasing me, but I see something I have never seen before. I see emptiness beneath the mirror that cracked. A narrow hallway that seems to go forever. If that wasn\u2019t proof enough, I feel a cold draft from that labyrinth that once was a mirror. \n\t\n\tI gaze down at the red floor, where my brain had been just a minute ago, with pieces of skull jutting out. It is completely clean though. The light blinks again and I lose it. I start punching the mirror, my blood oozes off my hands, shards of glass embedded deep in my trembling palms. I move to lick at my wounds, the metallic taste meeting my tongue. This taste exhilarates me because for once it isn\u2019t in my head. \n\n\tI don\u2019t bother to remove the glass. It is my armor and my war medal. The shards are trusty steeds, their blood a friendly slobber, like when a dog licks your hand. My brass knuckles made of mirrors will protect me from the world and my brain. I tell myself that because for once I feel grounded.\n\n\tI slowly move in just to get a slight view of the area. I will come back later with a flashlight, but I need to prove right now that this is real. I see no one, not even myself, so it must be real. I go in and my head goes silent. I love this, but then I see the red light. \u201cLooks like we got company,\u201d I muse to myself, a slight chuckle escaping my lips. I have no reason to laugh, but when you are in a bathroom mirror hallway most things seem funnier. \n\n\tI am determined to see that red light, make my discovery, prove the world wrong.

I step out\n\nAnd the city is ..... it's empty ....\n\nThe bustling streets, the moving cars, the perfectly synchronized pedestrians......**all gone.**\n\nThe entire city is deserted\n\n\u00a0\n\n**---------**\n\nI freeze.\n\nThe buildings remain. The neon signs still glow. The coffee shop, the bus stop, the advertisements on digital billboards they are all still here.\n\nBut the people are gone.\n\nNot a single soul moves in the streets. The only sound is the distant hum of an electric sign, flickering softly against the silence.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a reset.\n\nThis is something else.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do next.\n\nI broke the pattern.\n\nI move carefully, scanning my surroundings. My breath is too loud in the silence, my heartbeat like a drum in my ears.\n\nI take another step....\n\nA single voice echoes through the empty city.\n\n\"You shouldn\u2019t have done that.\"\n\nI whip around...nothing.\n\nThe voice wasn\u2019t inside my head this time.\n\nIt was real.\n\nSpoken. Out loud.\n\nAnd someone else is here with me.\n\nA single footstep.\n\nThen another.\n\nI stop breathing.\n\nThe city is empty. It should be silent.\n\nBut something is walking toward me.\n\nI don\u2019t turn around.\n\nI glance at the reflection in the glass of a nearby window.\n\nAnd I see him.\n\nThe person I saw on the other side.\n\n202200668?\n\nStanding at the end of the street.\n\nBut something is wrong.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe way he stands...\n\nIt\u2019s not natural.\n\nHis arms hang at his sides, too stiff. His head is tilted at an angle that feels forced. His body... too symmetrical.\n\nLike something trying to remember what human posture looks like.\n\nI bite down on my lip, my heartbeat hammering in my skull. That\u2019s not him.\n\nIt\u2019s rebuilding him.\n\nTrying to place him back into the world.\n\nLike an old file being corrupted as it loads.\n\nThe figure twitches.\n\nA sudden, violent jerk of the arm\u2014then stillness again.\n\nHis mouth is slightly open, but... nothing. No breath. No sound.\n\nThe system doesn\u2019t know what he would say.\n\nBecause the real him never spoke.\n\nHe sat. And he waited.\n\nForever.\n\nMy stomach twists into a tight knot.\n\nIt\u2019s making him for me to see.\n\nA warning.\n\nA message.\n\nA threat.\n\nAnd then.....\n\nThe world glitches.\n\nNot a flicker. Not a small reset.\n\nA full collapse.\n\nThe buildings bend and warp. The sky fractures like shattering glass. The ground beneath me distorts, twisting like liquid.\n\nI stumble backward.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t resetting.\n\nIt\u2019s breaking.\n\nAnd through it all, the entity just stands there.\n\nUnmoving. Unblinking. Waiting.\n\nThis world isn\u2019t just trying to stop me anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s coming to get me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI run.\n\nI don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t hesitate. I just move.\n\nThe ground beneath me warps, twisting in impossible angles, stretching too far and folding back on itself. The air is thick, like running through water, every step feeling like I\u2019m being dragged backward.\n\nBut I don\u2019t stop.\n\nI can't .....\n\nBehind me, the entity \u00a0remains still. He doesn\u2019t chase. He doesn\u2019t react.\n\nEverything around me is collapsing. The street ahead melts away, revealing an endless gray void beneath. Buildings on either side elongate like shadows at sunset, stretching into jagged, impossible spirals. The sky fractures, deep black cracks spreading like veins, splitting open like a wound.\n\nThe system is breaking itself to contain me....\n\n\\-Then everything stops again.-\n\nThe world is silent.\n\nThe collapsing streets, the twisting buildings, the fracturing sky\u2014all of it freezes.\n\nEven the air feels held in place.\n\nI stand there, panting, my heart pounding against my ribs. My skin is cold. My hands won\u2019t stop shaking.\n\nI glance over my shoulder. I wish I didn't....\n\nThe perso- the entity is still close to me... the same distance before I ran\n\nBut I didn't see it run with me or even move and he isn\u2019t glitching anymore.\n\nHe is disintegrating.\n\nGod I can't even describe what I'm seeing-\n\nI..I can see It's insides melting but It's... It's not human- I mean it's like a mix of human and animal insides intertwined.\n\nI just closed my eyes and turn around\n\nI need to get out of whatever this is\n\nI take another step.\n\nNothing.\n\nI opened my eyes\n\nAnd then, ahead of me\u2014\n\nAt the very end of the alley\u2014\n\nI see it.\n\nA door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI ran for it.\n\nThe door doesn\u2019t move.\n\nBut the moment I shift my angle\u2014just slightly, just enough to glance at it from the side\u2014it turns with me.\n\nI stop. My breath catches in my throat.\n\nI take a step to the right.\n\nThe door adjusts.\n\nI move left. It follows.\n\nNo matter where I stand, it is always facing me.\n\nA cold, suffocating feeling spreads through my chest.\n\nMy hands start shaking.\n\nThe city is still frozen behind me.\n\nThe sky is still fractured, the buildings still locked in their impossible shapes. The world is waiting, all the people in that world were waiting standing still staring at me\u2014like it doesn\u2019t know what to do next.\n\nBecause this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\n\nAhead\n\nThe door just stands there, silent, unyielding.\n\nAnd yet, I feel something beneath my skin. A pressure. A presence.\n\nSomething is on the other side.\n\nI reach out\u2014slowly, carefully\u2014fingers brushing against the cold, wooden surface.\n\nThe air shifts.\n\nThe weight of the world itself seems to lean forward.\n\nWatching.\n\nWaiting.\n\nI wrap my hand around the handle.\n\nAnd before I can even turn it\u2014\n\nThe door opens by itself.\n\nI step forward\n\nA slow, heavy motion.\n\nBeyond it, there is no room. No hallway. No structure at all.\n\nJust\u2014\n\nVoid.\n\nI fall.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can\u2019t move.\n\nI can\u2019t breathe.\n\nI am not standing, I am not floating\u2014 I simply exist.\n\nThe endless purgatory stretches before me, a world without meaning, a prison without walls.\n\nThe lost, the broken, the forgotten\u2014IIn my mind.... I see them all.\n\nSome still fight.  \nSome have given up.  \nSome are already gone.\n\nStuck for god knows how long.\n\nAnd then, at the very edge of it all\u2014\n\nHim.\n\n202200668.\n\nSitting exactly as he described. Outside his house. Unmoving.\n\nStill.\n\nI watch, unable to blink, unable to breathe.\n\nAnd then\u2014\n\nWithout a sound\u2014\n\nHe vanishes.\n\nNo warning. No struggle.\n\nJust\u2014 gone.\n\nLike he was never there at all.\n\nI didn't even saw it as my mind is bombarded with other victims' experience and their perspectives\n\nMy mind goes cold.\n\nThis must what happens to the forgotten.\n\nThey don\u2019t die.\n\nThey don\u2019t escape.\n\nThey just cease to exist.\n\nAnd before I can even process the horror of what I just witnessed\u2014\n\nThe void pulls me under.\n\n\\--------\n\nAnd then, I wake up.\n\nNot in the void. Not in the endless gray.\n\nI wake up in an empty parking lot.\n\nNo one around. No memory of how I got there. No sign that anything was wrong.\n\nIt was just me.\n\nAlone.\n\nAnd for the next thirty years, I never questioned it.\n\nBecause I didn\u2019t remember.\n\nThree Decades Later\n\nLife happened.\n\nI built a business, a successful burger restaurant. Got married. Had kids. Watched them grow.\n\nThirty years passed like nothing.

Just shadows of things that never were.\n\nBut they kept coming.\n\nThe same images, night after night\u2014\n\nA house that wasn\u2019t mine.  \nA horizon that never got closer.  \nA door that always faced me.  \nA world that never wanted me to leave.\n\nAnd the more I dreamed, the more something stirred inside me.\n\nNot memories. Not yet.\n\nJust a feeling.\n\nA weight I couldn\u2019t name.\n\nA pressure I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nAnd now\u2014\n\nI\u2019m still sitting here.\n\nStaring at the man across the restaurant.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t look away.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the way he carries himself\u2014his posture, his stillness.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just his presence.\n\nFamiliar. Unshakable.

I\u2019m not posting this for upvotes or attention. I need to get it out\u2014before I forget more than I already have.\n\nThis happened three months ago, but it already feels like it was years. Or maybe last night. Time's been weird lately.\n\nAnyway, I worked the night shift at D.C. Mall. You\u2019ve probably never heard of it unless you're local, and even then, most people forget it exists. It was one of those 1980s architectural corpses\u2014ugly red brick, boxy, and somehow always slightly humid inside, no matter the season. Half the stores were shuttered. Escalators were blocked off with yellow caution tape that had been there long enough to turn gray.\n\nI was hired as a night watch security temp, through some third-party company called Watchtower Facilities. Their logo was this awful pixelated eye with a tower in the middle. Looked like something off a broken CD-ROM. All the training was online\u2014cheap voiceovers, click-through slides, and a bulleted list of \"incident response protocols\" that I never thought I\u2019d actually use.\n\nMy job was simple:\n\n* Show up at 9:45 p.m.\n* Walk the mall loop once an hour\n* Watch the cameras in the security room\n* Lock the loading dock at midnight\n* Leave at 6:00 a.m.\n\nThat was it.\n\nAt first, it was easy money. I brought books, snacks, earbuds. The place was so dead it echoed. I used to take naps in the massage chairs outside the old Brookstone. The only other person I ever saw was the janitor\u2014an old guy named Leon who only spoke in nods and throat-clearings. He cleaned the same spots every night like he was stuck on loop.\n\nBut then the cameras started acting weird.\n\n\\[CAMERA FEED \u2013 ZONE 4, NORTH WING \u2013 01:17 A.M.\\] \\[STATIC \u2013 NO SIGNAL \u2013 RECONNECTING\u2026\\] \\[CAMERA ONLINE\\]\n\nAt first it was just glitches. One camera would cut out for a few seconds, then snap back. Normal, right? But then they started staying out longer. Always the same two zones\u2014Zone 4 and Zone 7.\n\nZone 4 was the North Wing\u2014dead center of the mall. Where the fountain used to be, before they filled it with dirt and fake plants. Zone 7 was the food court. That area always gave me a weird feeling. Too open. Too quiet. Even the air felt... wrong there.\n\nOne night, around 1:00 a.m., I noticed movement on the Zone 7 feed. A figure.\n\nIt walked across the screen\u2014slow, jerky. Like the frame rate was off. I thought it was Leon at first, but the figure was taller. Thinner. Dressed in something long and black. Like an old funeral suit.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: it didn\u2019t show up on any other cameras. It crossed the food court, but the moment it reached the next zone, it just vanished. No footsteps. No echo. Nothing.\n\nI checked the feeds, frame by frame. On one, the figure was mid-step. On the next, it was gone. Like the camera blinked.\n\nI did a loop. Took my flashlight. Told myself it was just a glitch.\n\nThe mall was silent.\n\nYou ever walk through a space that feels like it\u2019s remembering something? That\u2019s the only way I can describe it. Like the walls were listening. Like they\u2019d seen something bad.\n\nI got to the food court. All the tables were upside down, chairs stacked. The air smelled like stale fries and mildew.\n\nThen I heard something.\n\nNot footsteps. Not breathing. Something... dragging.\n\nIt was soft. Wet. Like damp cloth being pulled across tile.\n\nI pointed my flashlight toward the back of the Sbarro. That\u2019s where it was coming from. The light hit the counter, then something ducked behind it.\n\nFast.\n\nToo fast.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I expected to see. A raccoon? A homeless guy? Hell, maybe even Leon fucking with me.\n\nI called out. \u201cHey. You\u2019re not supposed to be here. Mall\u2019s closed.\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\nJust the dragging sound. Closer now.\n\nI backed away. Tried to radio Leon. No response.\n\nI should have left right then. I should have quit.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I got back to the security room, all the feeds were static. Just black and white fuzz, like an old TV without signal.\n\nThen\u2014just for a second\u2014I saw something flicker onto the Zone 4 feed.\n\nThe fountain. Except it wasn\u2019t filled with dirt. It was full of water again. Murky, greenish-black.\n\nAnd something was floating in it.\n\nA mannequin. I thought. Had to be. White plastic arms sticking out at weird angles. No face. Just a round, blank head.\n\nThen its head turned.\n\nNot a glitch. Not an illusion. It turned, slowly, like it heard me.\n\nI pulled the plug on the monitors. Sat in the dark for the rest of my shift.\n\nAt 6:00 a.m., the doors unlocked like normal. Sunlight hit the atrium, and the mall looked like it always did\u2014dead, lifeless, beige.\n\nLeon passed me by the exit, nodded like nothing happened. I asked if he saw anything.\n\nHe just said:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\""},"70":{"title":"Hi guys.\nI\u2019ve got this idea but I\u2019m too lazy and busy to fully work on it, and I don\u2019t want to just forget about it, so I\u2019m throwing it out here to see what you think.

A learned woman, she would join a convent in 1433 when here parents mysteriously died. It was there she would learn to read and write. Elya was Disliked by the other nuns at the convent do to the misfortune and tragedy following her where ever she would go. Several nuns would pass away during the few years of her stay, form sickness and freak accidents. In 1436 secret wright's discussing necromantic rites and rituals were discovered in her possion. She was then tried and executed for witchcraft. Recently archeologists have unloved these writing not only detailing her alleged practices but her life's story as well.  After transcribing the documents I am utterly shocked and horrified by there contense and figured I turn it over to the most qualified experts of all..... the occultists of reddit. \n\nThe Grimoire of Elya of Black Hollow\n\n\u201cKept by mine own hand, in ink, blood, and ash.\u201d\n(Written in the margins of church hymnals, on scraps of vellum, hidden beneath hearthstones and behind chimney bricks.)\n\nOf the Witch\u2019s Nature\nYou were not born as other girls. The wind stirred when you wailed your first breath. You bear the mark, seen only in candle smoke and the reflection of a black mirror. Know this: a witch is not made\u2014she is remembered. You are mine, and you are Herself.\n\nWitchcraft is not a thing of play. It is blood, bone, breath, and will. It is ancient, older than the Church or the king, and feared because it is free.\n\nThe world will not love you for this path. You must not ask it to. You must only learn and endure.\n\nBook Structure\nThis book will unfold in several handwritten sections, each representing different aspects of Elya\u2019s knowledge and pact.\n\nI. The Black Covenant\nHer pact with the Devil. \n\nII. Charms, Curses, and the Evil Eye\nSpells and spoken charms to curse cattle, wither crops, blight wombs, sicken men, and ruin luck.\n\nIII. Herbs of Shadow and Blood\nHerb and root lore, poisonous and baneful plants, ointments, flying salves, and how to gather by the moon.\n\nIV. Familiars and Spirits\nDescriptions of her spirit companions, how she summoned them, fed them, and used them in workings.\n\nV. Signs and Warnings\nHow to read omens, strange weather, birth defects, black dogs, or stillborn animals as signs from the Devil or spirits.\n\nVI. The Sabbath Rite\nElya\u2019s personal accounts of attending the Witch's Sabbath, including songs, mock masses, rituals, and otherworldly visions.\n\nVII. Tools and Hidden Words\nHow she made her tools\u2014wands, poppets, knives, and spirit bottles\u2014and the secret names and languages she used.\n\nVIII. Death and Devil\u2019s Work\nHow to bring death to men and beasts, cause miscarriages, storms, madness, and rot. Blood magic and graveyard rites.\n\nIX. The Final Oath\nA prophecy or warning at the end\n\n\u201cI renounce God, His Christ, and all His saints. I give myself, body and soul, unto thee, Master. Take me as thy servant and seal our bond.\u201d\n\nThe Covenant of Black Hollow \u2720\n\nAs writ in the Devil\u2019s hour, beneath the Gallows Bough, by mine own hand, Elya, daughter of the night.\n\nOn the Night of the Pact\nLet the moon be dark and the air still. Let no bell toll nor cock crow.\n\nAt the hour of midnight, go unto a crossroads, where two roads meet and none dare walk.

Familiars and Spirits\n\u201cThey come by night, in dream or smoke, to suckle and speak. I call them by name, as they called me.\u201d\n\nOn Familiars\nDefinition: A familiar is a spirit\u2014often clothed in animal shape\u2014that binds itself to the witch to serve her will, deliver her power, and report her deeds to the Devil.\nBinding Rite:\n\nBlooded Milk Offering: Mix milk, your own blood (3 drops), and ashes.

Signs and Warnings\n\u201cThe world speaks in cracks and shadows. The wise watch. The fool forgets.\u201d\n\nOn the Reading of Signs\nA true witch reads not only the heavens and herbs, but the twitching of a dog\u2019s ear, the crack in a teacup, the song of a crow. All things speak, in their way. Elya was taught by her familiar to listen to the earth with her feet and the wind with her teeth.\n\n\u201cAll things have language\u2014the Devil reads it backwards.\u201d\n\nDaily Omens: What the World Tells\nBird-Sign (Ornithomancy)\nOne crow cawing at dawn: Death draws near.\n\nThree crows circling sunwise: Power is rising.

Ward again.\n\nThe Witch\u2019s Body as Oracle\nElya understood that the body, too, foretells. Pain, twitches, and blood are all signs of spiritual interference or hidden workings.\n\nLeft palm itching: A gift coming.\n\nRight palm itching: Someone takes from you.\n\nThigh pain at night: Familiar feeding.\n\nSudden nosebleed during spellcraft: A spirit answers.\n\nEye twitch (left): Someone curses you.\n\nEye twitch (right): Someone praises or seeks you.\n\nDream-Warnings (Nocturna Visiones)\n\u201cDreams sent by spirit or Devil feel thick, like honeyed smoke.\u201d\n\nDream of teeth falling: Death in the family\n\nDream of drowning in ink or mud: Spell has backfired\n\nDream of goat staring: Devil is watching\n\nDream of flying, unbidden: A spirit seeks to ride you in sleep\n\nDream of fire eating a house: Curse must be undone before the next full moon\nProtection Against Harmful Dreams:\n\nSleep with iron scissors beneath the pillow\n\nTie a red thread to your big toe\n\nPlace rowan berries under bed and say:\n\n\u201cBy root and bone, by moonlight fair,\nLet no spirit ride me there.\u201d\n\nSigns of Cursed Land or Space\nMilk curdles in the open air\n\nNo birdsong, even at dawn\n\nNails rust within hours\n\nBread will not rise\n\nDog refuses to enter\n\nReflection appears wrong in glass or water\n\nTo test land: Prick your finger and drop the blood in a dish of spring water.

The Sabbath Rites\n\u201cI rode the wind and kissed the hoof, and there I was among them.\u201d\n\nThough many witches walk alone, the old ways speak of coven-magic: the gathering of witches beneath moon and tree, where their power is multiplied, their spirits entwined, and the Devil himself walks among them. These rites are held in secret hollows, moors, and stone circles, known only to those who carry the mark and speak the hidden tongue.\n\nThis chapter records the rites of the coven: their structure, ceremonies, and shared spellcraft\u2014preserved by Elya, who was counted among the Nine of Hollow Oak.\n\n\u201cWe fly on stormwind, borne by herb and oath.\nWe gather where the stone is cracked and the earth bleeds.\nHe waits with goat eyes and a crown of shadow.\u201d\n\nPreparation of the Body\nTo attend the Sabbath, the witch must be unseen by God and known to the Devil. Before departure:\n\nAnoint the body with flying ointment:\n\nBelladonna leaf\n\nHenbane seed\n\nMandrake root\n\nPoppy milk\n\nHog\u2019s fat\n\nAsh of unbaptized stillborn\n\nRecite the Unbinding Charm:\n\n\u201cI cast off Christ and cross and kin.\nBy root and claw, I ride within.\nBy the Devil\u2019s mark, I know my name.\nLet Heaven burn, I feel no shame.\u201d\n\nLie on hearthstone or in furrow. Eyes must close. All else comes as dream or shadow-journey.\n\nFlight to the Sabbath\nElya records:\n\n\u201cI flew as hare and smoke. Crooktail ran beside me.\nOver steeple, over stream. No dog howled.\nI passed through air like breath through teeth.\u201d\n\nFamiliars guide the way. The wind may scream, but none shall hear unless they too are marked.\n\nArrival\nThe place of Sabbath is marked by:\n\nA ring of stones or scorched ground\n\nAn old tree bent like a claw\n\nThe smell of burnt feathers, piss, and resin\n\nThe Devil appears: not always horned. Sometimes as a dark man, sometimes goat-shaped, sometimes a child with burning eyes.\n\nThe Greeting\nAll witches must kneel and kiss the Devil. Not on the hand\u2014but:\n\n\u201cOn the back, on the hoof, or on the shadowed mouth.\nWherever he turns, kiss without flinch.\u201d\n\nHe may speak true names\u2014hide nothing.\n\nThe Oath of Fealty\nEach witch renews her pact aloud:\n\n\u201cI am thine, and none else\u2019s.\nMy blood for thy wine. My soul for thy fire.\nMark me, take me, use me.\nI shall do harm as thou shall command.\u201d\n\nBlood is drawn from the Devil\u2019s nail or thorned branch and licked or burned into the skin.\n\n\nFeasting and Revel\nWitches dine on:\n\nBlack bread\n\nRoasted crow\n\nBlood pudding\n\nUnblessed wine\n\nFat of hanged men (in dreams or metaphor)\n\nThe feast is strange\u2014some food turns to ash, some to honey. Many see beasts eating at the table, or babies crying under the cloth.\n\nDancing and Union\nAll join in the round dance, widdershins (counterclockwise), hand to paw to wing. Music is heard, though no instrument is seen. Some dances go till dawn\u2014or till madness.\n\nAt the height, some take the Devil as lover. Others are mounted by familiars. All this is spirit-work, a mingling of will, pain, and power.\n\nElya writes:\n\n\u201cHe burned and froze me. I saw the roots of stars.\nHe laughed when I wept. I woke with ash on my thighs.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, a full coven numbers thirteen:\n\nTwelve witches, one for each lunar month\n\nOne Devil, spirit, or familiar who presides (called the Black Man, the Goat-Brother, or the Crooked One)\n\nHowever, smaller covens of three, five, seven, or nine are also common. Power grows with number, but intention, blood-tie, and oath are what truly bind a circle.\n\nEach witch may take a role by gift, lineage, or lot:\n\nMother of the Circle \u2013 Keeper of rites, midwife of curses, healer\n\nHand of Flame \u2013 Leads in calling spirits, bearer of fire\n\nVoice of the Moon \u2013 Oracle and chanter of charms\n\nKeeper of the Bone \u2013 Tends to dead spirits and ancestors\n\nWatcher at the Crossroads \u2013 Guardian, protector, knower of paths\n\nWeaver of Knots \u2013 Binder of fate and spells\n\nHag of the Wood \u2013 Knower of plants, poisons, and transformations\n\nBride of the Beast \u2013 Consort of the Devil in his aspect\n\nWitch of Silence \u2013 Keeps secrets and speaks only in ritual\n10\u201312.

With them, I blazed.\nWe flew, we sang, we cursed, we healed.\nAll we did was power. All we were was truth.\nThe world feared what it could not chain.\nSo we danced in the dark, free and laughing.\u201d\n\nThe Satanic Baptism\n\u201cFor I am not born of Eve, nor bathed in holy water,\nbut anointed in ash, in blood, and in the Devil\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\nThis rite unbinds a witch from the false God and binds her to the Adversary. It is often performed at the first Sabbath or after the Oath of Blood.\n\nTools Required:\nA basin of blood and black wine\n\nA bone needle or thorn\n\nA black cord (for the naming)\n\nA black candle\n\nAn image of the Horned One (or a masked celebrant)\n\nThe Rite:\nThe candidate is stripped bare, blindfolded, and led to the circle at midnight.\n\nShe is asked three times:\n\u201cDo you renounce the God of men, and all his works?\u201d\nShe answers: \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nHer brow is marked with ash and pig\u2019s blood in the shape of a hoof or inverted cross.\n\nThe celebrant says:\n\u201cBorn in shadow, reborn in flame,\nYou are no longer [birth name],\nBut [witch name], daughter of the Night.\u201d\n\nHer new name is whispered into a toad\u2019s ear and released.\n\nShe drinks from the chalice of black wine and blood.\n\n\nThe Black Mass\n\u201cWe sing not to the Christ, but to the Serpent.\nWe do not kneel \u2014 we dance. We do not beg \u2014 we conjure.\u201d\n\nA rite held on high Sabbaths or in mockery of Church feasts (especially Easter and Christmas), the Black Mass is a gathering of power, blasphemy, and ecstasy. It may serve as initiation, celebration, or pact renewal.\n\nSetting:\nHeld at midnight, in a desecrated or ruined place: a defiled chapel, a stone circle, or a burial ground.\n\nThe altar may be a stone, a coffin, or in some traditions, the body of a willing celebrant.\n\nTools:\nA Black Book of chants and reversed prayers\n\nCandles made of fat (human or animal)\n\nHost made from rye bread marked with the Devil\u2019s sigil\n\nWine mixed with gall or menstrual blood\n\nA skull or bone relic\n\nInverted cross or goat\u2019s skull\n\nStructure:\n1.

The Unholy Host\n\nThe \u201cHost\u201d is raised and mocked.\n\nThe celebrant speaks:\n\n\u201cThis is not the body of Christ,\nbut the bread of freedom.\nTake and eat, and be made whole in sin.\u201d\n\n3. Invocation of the Devil\n\nThe Devil is called by many names:\n\n\u201cLvcifer, Samael, Azazel, Asmodei,\nCome in smoke, come in storm, come in song.\u201d\n\nA familiar or spirit may appear in vision or possession.\n\n4. Offering and Oath\n\nBlood may be offered in a dish.\n\nOaths are renewed:\n\n\u201cMy soul is mine, and I give it freely.\nMy flesh is yours, and I keep it gladly.\nWe are bound until time unravels.\u201d\n\n5. The Dance\n\nThe circle ends in ecstatic dance, laughter, flight, or trance.\n\nSome covens report levitation, visions, or carnal union with spirits.\n\nThe Blasphemous Litany\nA common chant sung during such rites:\n\n\u201cHoly is the Serpent, Prince of Light,\nWhose fire frees us from chains.\nWoe to the tyrant on high,\nWho calls freedom sin and knowledge evil.\nWe deny him, we defy him,\nAnd we rise by night in His name.\u201d\n\nPrecautions and Warnings\nThese rites are not for the unblooded or half-hearted.\n\nSpirits may be called that cannot be sent away.\n\nOnce baptized in shadow, the mark lingers in dreams and flesh.\n\nDo not attempt these rites without full knowledge and consent \u2014 the Devil bargains well, but does not forgive deceit.\n\nElya\u2019s Warning:\n\u201cWe who walk this path do so with open eyes.\nNo light may save us, but we do not seek it.\nWe carry our own flame \u2014 black, burning, and holy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Great Rite (Union with the Devil)\n\n\u201cHe came in shadow, but offered light. He took my name and gave me power. I am no longer theirs. I am His.\u201d\n\u2014Elya of Black Hollow\n\nA secret rite wherein a chosen witch, often the Bride of the Beast, joins bodily or spiritually with the Crooked One.\n\nTakes place at midnight under the black sky\n\nAn altar of black cloth and bone is prepared\n\nA blade is offered, a kiss is given, and oaths are whispered\n\nThrough this rite, the witch may gain visions, familiars, or the Devil\u2019s Gifts (the Eye, the Tongue, the Flight, the Form).\n\nLed by the Hand of Flame and Voice of the Moon, the coven beats staves against the earth, howling the wind\u2019s name.\n\nA cauldron is filled with water, salt, and thorn\n\nFlames are cast in, and breath is blown\n\nChant:\n\n\u201cWind and fire, sky and sea,\nWe unbind the storm, let it run free!\u201d\n\nOften used to destroy crops, scatter enemies, or veil a working.\n\n\n\n\nThe Working Circle\nSpells cast at Sabbath are stronger. Here are the rites permitted:\n\nBinding an enemy with grave dirt and image\n\nCursing a house by name and blood\n\nCalling storms by whirling a blade in water\n\nSeeing the future in a basin of piss and coal\n\nNaming a new witch with blood and milk on the tongue\n\nShared Spellcraft\nThe Knot of Nine\nA spell woven by nine witches, each tying a knot in black thread, chanting:\n\n\u201cBy knot and will, by breath and blood,\nWhat we bind, shall not unbind.\nTill death unmake it, it shall hold.\u201d\n\nUsed for binding enemies, sealin\n\n\"One witch is a flame. Three are a fire. Nine are a storm.\u201d\n\u2014Elya of Black Hollow\n\nDeparting\nTo leave the Sabbath:\n\nKiss the Devil\u2019s mark again.\n\nSpeak your name backward three times.\n\nClose your left eye.\n\nYou will wake in your bed, field, or hearth\u2014sometimes marked, sometimes not.\nSigns You Have Attended Truly\nAsh or soot on feet\n\nBlood at the inner thigh or breast\n\nThe sound of drumming in your ears at dawn\n\nMilk curdling without reason\n\nFire refusing to light\n\nFinal Words from Elya\n\u201cDo not speak of the Sabbath by name in daylight.\nIt is not a dream. It is a place. It remembers.\u201d\n\n\nVII. Tools and Hidden Words\n\u201cA blade in the dark, a word in the bone\u2014thus is the witch\u2019s work done.\u201d\n\nOn the Witch's Tools\nThe tools of craft are not sacred in themselves, but made potent through use, blood, and word. A witch may use a shepherd\u2019s knife, a stolen spoon, or a bone found at crossroads\u2014if bound by rite.\n\n1. The Bladestone (Knife)\nName: Harrowbit\nMaterial: Black iron blade, horn handle\nUse: To cut cords, herbs, spirits; to draw circles; to bleed\nConsecration:\n\nPlunge blade in grave dirt for one full moon\n\nRub with oil of wormwood and blood from left hand\n\nWhisper:\n\n\u201cCut the veil, drink the breath, silence the name.\u201d\n\n2. The Spirit Bowl\nName: Mother\u2019s Mouth\nMaterial: Clay dish glazed with bone ash\nUse: For offerings, feeding familiars, mixing blood and herb\nKept: Buried under the hearthstone when not in use\nRitual Words When Placing Food for Spirits:\n\n\u201cWhat is given is taken, what is taken is given. Eat and remember me.\u201d\n\n3. The Staff\nName: Crooked Sister\nMaterial: Rowan wood, bound in black thread\nUse: Walking, flying, stirring storms, commanding familiars\nCharm to Awaken It:\n\n\u201cTwist and rise, by root and sky.\nWalk with me, unseen by eye.\u201d\n\n\n4. The Bone Box\nName: The Holder of Silence\nMaterial: Box made of elderwood, with teeth and bones inside\nUse: To trap a spirit or curse, to store a spell for release\nHow to Bind Something Within:\n\nSpeak the spell or name into the box\n\nPlace a drop of your blood and a token of the target\n\nTie closed with black ribbon\n\nSeal with breath three times and say:\n\u201cStay here, rot here, work here.\u201d\n\n5. The Ash Mirror\nName: Seeing Shade\nMaterial: Glass smoked black with resin and soot\nUse: Scrying, summoning, reversing spells\nWords to Open the Mirror:\n\n\u201cShow what is hidden, draw what is far,\nLet shadow speak and silence scar.\u201d\n\nElya\u2019s Note:\n\n\u201cNever let the mirror face the window, or it will drink the sky and not give it back.\u201d\n\nOn Hidden Words and Witch-Speech\nWitches speak in riddles, crooked tongue, and the Devil\u2019s tongue writ backward. Hidden words hold power\u2014not only to mask meaning, but to bind spirits, hide curses, and speak truth through smoke.\n\nExamples of Witch-Speech:\n\u201cRed thread on right foot\u201d\n(Protect from hexing while you sleep)\n\n\u201cMilk turns sour before cockcrow\u201d\n(Witch has passed by your threshold)\n\n\u201cThe cat blinks thrice\u201d\n(Your spell has taken root in the target)\n\n\u201cAsh in the west wind\u201d\n(A rival witch is watching you)\n\nReversed Charms (Power in Speaking Backwards)\nSpells may be spoken in reverse to break them.\n\n\u201cTools may rust. Words may fade. But the true power lies in the hand that dares, and the tongue that lies. Keep your craft close. Hide it in plain sight. Speak crooked, write backward. The Devil favors the clever.\u201d\n\nChapter VIII: Death and the Devil\u2019s Work\n\u201cThe breath stops, but the road goes on. The grave opens more than earth. There are deeper things than death.\u201d\n\u2014Elya of Black Hollow\n\nOf Death\u2019s Dominion\nTo a witch, death is not final\u2014it is fertile. From death comes:\n\nPower (harvested from spirit, corpse, and bone)\n\nProtection (through pacts with the dead)\n\nProphecy (through communion with spirits)\n\nRevenge (through necromantic arts)\n\nThe Church fears death as an end.\nThe witch knows it is a door.\n\nThe Devil\u2019s Work The Death Oath Rite:\nPrick finger with bone thorn\n\nBleed into black bowl with henbane and ash\n\nSpeak:\n\n\u201cI give breath, bone, and shadow.\nTake what you will, Devil mine.\nTeach me what the dead know.\nLet my name rot from the Church\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nAfter this, the Devil sends a familiar, and the witch gains access to his realm\u2014The Black Vale, The Crooked Field, or The Sabbath World.\n\nTo Bind a Restless Spirit:\nTie poppet of the dead in thread soaked in wine and urine\n\nBury at the foot of their grave with stone atop\n\nSpeak:\n\n\u201cNo more walking, no more moan,\nStay in silence, bone to bone.\u201d\n\nTo Raise a Corpse (for Questioning):\nMust be done within 13 nights of death\n\nBurn yew and myrrh\n\nDig shallow trench\n\nPlace coin in the mouth of the skull\n\nChant:\n\n\u201cAsh to ash, but speak once more,\nLet the earth forget its chore.\nOne question, one truth, one toll.\u201d\n\nThe raised dead will answer one truth only, then crumble.\n\n\u201cDeath listens. The Devil teaches. But both demand payment.\nDo not call if you do not wish to be heard.\nDo not knock if you do not wish the door opened.\nYet if you must\u2026\nWalk boldly. And bring a bone.\u201d\n\n\nThe Final Oath\n\n\u201cNo witch is truly made until she speaks her name before shadow and flame,\nand gives herself over\u2014wholly, willingly, and without the priest\u2019s blessing.\u201d\n\u2014Elya of Black Hollow\n\nWhen the Oath Is Taken\nOn the night of a new moon, when the sky holds no light.\n\nIn the heart of the woods, at a place where three paths cross.\n\nWith a black book, a bone knife, a circle of salt, and blood to sign.\n\nOften taken alone, or witnessed only by the familiar or a Devil's spirit.\n\nThe Preparation\nFast for one day.\nSpeak to no soul for a night and a day.\nWash with spring water and wormwood.\nAnoint the brow with soot and henbane.\nDraw a circle with an iron nail, and mark it with:\n\nThe sign of the Devil (a hoofprint, horned cross, or inverted torch)\n\nThe name you shall be known by in the Devil\u2019s book\n\nA drop of your own blood\n\nThe Oath, Spoken Aloud:\n\u201cI cast off the name given to me by priest and kin.\nI take the name of shadow and secret.\nI bind myself to the Crooked Path,\nTo walk where the moon is dead,\nWhere the trees whisper in tongues,\nWhere the Devil waits in ash and bone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy blood and breath, I give myself.\nMy body shall be his temple,\nMy words his whisper,\nMy will his fire.\u201d\n\u201cI swear to harm as I am harmed,\nTo heal only when I will,\nTo walk unseen,\nTo know the tongues of root, flame, and beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn return, I ask:\nPower in my hand,\nFire in my breath,\nFlight in the night,\nThe eye that sees beyond the veil.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet no priest undo this vow.\nLet no church cleanse this soul.\nLet no light blind me from the path.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the mark, by the name, by the kiss\u2014I am witch.\u201d\n\nConsequences and Blessings\nGains:\n\nPower over weather, sickness, and shadow\n\nThe Evil Eye\n\nSpirits of service\n\nKnowledge of the herbs of death and life\n\nAccess to the Sabbath and the Devil\u2019s World\n\nResistance to fire, iron, or hexes (in part)\n\nConsequences and Blessings\nGains:\n\nPower over weather, sickness, and shadow\n\nThe Evil Eye\n\nSpirits of service\n\nKnowledge of the herbs of death and life\n\nAccess to the Sabbath and the Devil\u2019s World\n\nResistance to fire, iron, or hexes (in part)\n\n\u201cI was no one.

I wasn\u2019t chasing some life-changing experience or trying to prove anything to myself. I just wanted silence.\n\nThe last stretch of road was barely a road at all\u2014just gravel and dirt cutting through miles of dense forest. The trees loomed high, pressed too close together, their trunks disappearing into the early evening mist. The only sign of civilization had been a gas station twenty miles back, where the attendant barely glanced up when I paid.\n\nI was alone. That was the plan.\n\nThe campsite was perfect: a small clearing near a stream, just far enough from the main trail that no one would bother me. I set up my tent quickly, built a small fire, and let myself sink into the quiet. No emails, no calls, no other people. Just me, the cold night air, and the distant sound of water moving over rocks.\n\nI should have felt at peace.\n\nBut something felt off.\n\nThe silence wasn\u2019t *empty*.\n\nIt was watching.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nI woke up sometime after midnight, heart pounding.

I lay there, listening.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nA light.\n\nIt flickered through the thin fabric of my tent, pale and unnatural. For a split second, I thought it was the moon. But it wasn\u2019t moonlight. It moved\u2014erratic, shifting.\n\nIt was coming from the tent next to mine.\n\nBut there *was no tent next to mine*.\n\nI sat up too fast, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew, with absolute certainty, that I was alone. No other campers. No other tents. I had checked.\n\nBut there it was.\n\nAnd someone\u2014or *something*\u2014was inside.\n\nA shadow moved behind the fabric. Slow. Deliberate.\n\nI should have gotten up. Should have unzipped my tent, stepped outside, and demanded to know who was there.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nI lay back down, pulled the sleeping bag up to my chin, and squeezed my eyes shut.\n\nThe light stayed on until dawn.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nMorning should have made it better.\n\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I unzipped my tent and stepped into the clearing, the second tent was gone.\n\nNo fabric. No poles. No footprints.\n\nJust empty, undisturbed dirt.\n\nI stood there for a long time, my breath fogging in the cold morning air. My mind scrambled for a logical explanation, but none of them made sense. I had seen it. I had watched the light flicker. I had seen *something* move inside.\n\nAnd now, it was like it had never been there at all.\n\nI should have left then. Packed up, hiked back to my car, and driven away without looking back.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nI told myself it had to be a dream, or a trick of the firelight. That I was being paranoid. That I was imagining things.\n\nI spent the day hiking, trying to shake the uneasy feeling clinging to me. The further I went, the quieter the forest became. No birds. No rustling in the underbrush. Just the sound of my own breathing.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nNot an animal. Not the wind.\n\n*Whispering.*\n\nIt was faint, just on the edge of hearing. A dry, papery sound, threading through the trees, curling around my ears.\n\nI didn\u2019t try to understand the words.\n\nI turned back.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nBy the time I made it back to camp, the sun was setting.

Same flickering glow inside.\n\nBut this time, the zipper was partially open.\n\nWaiting.\n\nMy whole body screamed at me to *run*. But I didn\u2019t.

The trees\u2014*they weren\u2019t the same trees*. They stretched higher, twisted in ways that made my stomach churn. The clearing wasn\u2019t a clearing anymore. The path back to my car was gone.\n\nI wasn\u2019t where I had been.\n\nI grabbed my bag, my phone. The screen was dead. No battery. No way to check the time.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nNot whispering. Not rustling.\n\n*Breathing.*\n\nSlow. Deep. Just outside my tent.\n\nI didn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t breathe.\n\nAnd then\u2014\n\nThe zipper started to slide down.\n\nSlow.\n\nDeliberate.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nI don\u2019t remember running.\n\nI only remember the endless trees, the dark swallowing me whole, and the whispers\u2014*always whispering*.\n\nI ran until my legs gave out.

The system saw me watching. It knows I saw the mistake.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s correcting itself.\n\nI take a step back. My heel scrapes against the pavement\u2014\n\nAnd the world restarts.\n\nLike flipping a switch, the city exhales. Cars lurch forward, tires screeching against the pavement as if making up for lost time. Pedestrians continue their steps without hesitation, their conversations flowing seamlessly as if nothing happened. The bird in the sky flaps its wings again and disappears over the rooftops.\n\nBut something is wrong.\n\nEverything is moving too fast.\n\nThe flow of people, the motion of cars\u2014it\u2019s like the world is trying to catch up.\n\nTrying to overwrite the glitch.\n\nMy stomach twists.\n\nI force myself to breathe, to keep moving, to blend in.\n\nDon\u2019t react.

A route I\u2019ve never taken before.\n\nThe moment I do, I feel the pressure change.\n\nLike the air itself just realigned.\n\nI keep walking, heart pounding, waiting for the world to fight back. Waiting for the correction.\n\nThen\u2014a voice.\n\nNot from behind me.\n\nNot from in front of me.\n\nNot from anywhere.\n\nBut it\u2019s trying to be human.\n\n\"T\u0337\u0313\u0350\u0356\u0339u\u0334\u035d\u034e\u0326r\u0337\u0311\u030d\u0339n\u0336\u030f\u030b\u031e\u032c a\u0338\u0360\u0347r\u0337\u030d\u0311\u0318\u031co\u0335\u0344\u030e\u0347\u0356u\u0337\u0358\u0348n\u0334\u0344\u035d\u0355d\u0334\u031a\u0345\u0332.\"\n\nMy body locks up.\n\nThe voice is wrong.\n\nToo smooth in some places.

Not a spoken one, not one whispered between tenants, but a feeling. A cold dread that clung to the chipped porcelain and the tarnished brass fixtures. Amelia, a pragmatic art student, had dismissed the rumors she\u2019d overheard from the building's aging super as fanciful nonsense. \u201cOld pipes, drafty building,\u201d she\u2019d muttered, unpacking her paint supplies.\nThe first few weeks were uneventful. Long soaks after hours spent hunched over canvases were a small luxury. But then, the water started to behave strangely. Sometimes, it would turn icy cold for a few seconds, even with the hot tap running full blast. Other times, faint whispers seemed to rise with the steam, too indistinct to understand. Amelia chalked it up to the building\u2019s eccentric plumbing.\nOne Tuesday evening, after a particularly frustrating painting session, Amelia ran a bath. The water was unusually dark, almost a murky grey, despite the taps running clear. She hesitated, then shrugged. Maybe it was just sediment. As she lowered herself into the tub, the water rippled unnaturally, as if something had brushed against her leg from below. She pulled her legs up, her heart thumping. Nothing.\nShe tried to relax, leaning back against the cold porcelain. The whispers started again, closer this time. She strained to hear, and a single word seemed to detach itself from the hiss of the water: \u201cMine.\u201d\nAmelia shot up, the water sloshing over the sides. She scrambled out, her skin prickling. The water, now still, looked perfectly normal. She told herself it was stress, exhaustion. She needed sleep.\nThe next night, she avoided the bathtub, opting for a quick shower. But the feeling of being watched, of something lurking just out of sight, persisted. The whispers seemed to follow her, faint and sibilant, even when no water was running.\nThe following evening, a persistent chill permeated the apartment. Amelia, despite herself, felt drawn to the bathroom. The door creaked open on its own as she approached. The bathtub was full, the water a viscous black. This time, there were no whispers, only a heavy silence that pressed against her ears.\nA single, pale hand, its fingers long and skeletal, broke the surface of the water. It didn't reach for her, didn't move at all, just floated there, disturbingly still. Amelia\u2019s breath hitched in her throat. This wasn't faulty plumbing. This was something else entirely.\nShe backed away slowly, her eyes fixed on the hand. As she reached the doorway, the hand submerged, the black water rippling once before becoming perfectly still again.\nAmelia didn\u2019t sleep that night. Every creak of the old building, every gust of wind against the window, sounded like the sloshing of water. The next morning, she packed a bag, intending to stay with a friend.\nAs she passed the bathroom door, she heard a faint gurgling sound. Curiosity, or perhaps a morbid fascination, compelled her to look. The bathtub was empty, save for a single, tarnished brass drain stopper. But etched into the porcelain at the bottom of the tub, as if carved by a ghostly finger, was the word: \u201cSoon.\u201d\nAmelia didn\u2019t go back to Apartment 3B. Her friend let her stay on her couch indefinitely. Months later, she heard through the building grapevine that a new tenant had moved into her old apartment. A young man, eager for a cheap rent in a central location.\nOne rainy Tuesday evening, miles away in her friend\u2019s cozy living room, Amelia felt a sudden, inexplicable chill. She shivered, pulling her blanket tighter. Somewhere in the city, in the echoing silence of Apartment 3B, the claw-footed bathtub was likely filling again. And waiting.\n"},"89":{"title":"I Collect Diaries IV: Ethan Brown","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jsoyei\/i_collect_diaries_iv_ethan_brown\/","flair":null,"author":"Hefty_River_1238","selftext":"My name is Ethan and I\u2019m writing this because my mom doesn\u2019t believe me. I told her I saw a zombie wandering along the beach last night, but she just sighed, ruffled my hair, and told me to stop watching so many horror movies. But I know what I saw.\n\nMy parents and I live on an island far from the cities. They told me it\u2019s part of their job\u2014they\u2019re in charge of taking care of important people\u2019s houses. They didn\u2019t give me many details, just that it was hard work but paid really well. I didn\u2019t agree with moving, but they convinced me with the latest video game console. Who could say no to that?\n\nContrary to what people think, studying at home is boring. I miss my friends. If they were here, at least they\u2019d believe me. We have neighbors, sure, but there aren\u2019t many kids my age. Most of the houses belong to businesspeople and scientists who only visit from time to time.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here for three months. The island is huge, but my parents have forbidden me from going beyond the houses. They say there are dangerous places. They didn\u2019t give any explanations, just threats of punishment if I disobeyed. I did anyway.\n\nGal, our Great Dane, and I ventured a bit farther. We walked along the beach and then took a dirt path that led us to an unfamiliar part of the island. I carried a small flashlight because it was already getting dark. In the distance, I saw some bright lights and metallic structures. I approached carefully and saw a group of people wearing suits like astronauts. I didn\u2019t understand what they were doing. Maybe they were building a rocket? I want to be an astronaut when I grow up, so I watched in fascination.\n\nThese people were going in and out of a strange building. From where I was hiding, I saw them carrying boxes, lots of boxes. I decided to stay for a while, hidden behind some bushes, just to watch. Everything seemed normal until two men ran out of the building toward the ocean.\n\nThat made me nervous. Something wasn\u2019t right. I waited five minutes before leaving, but just as I was about to go, I felt a light vibration in the ground. It wasn\u2019t an earthquake\u2014more like a sudden jolt. Gal started barking for no reason. I didn\u2019t want to risk it, so I decided to head back.\n\nAs I walked home along the beach, I saw it.\n\n\n\nAbout a hundred meters away, a staggering figure was slowly moving. At first I thought it was a drunk man, but when the moonlight hit his face, I felt a chill. His skin was pale, his eyes empty, and he had dark stains on his clothes.\n\n\n\nGal barked loudly. The thing stopped for a second and then began walking toward us.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t wait to find out more. I grabbed Gal by the collar and we ran as fast as we could. In the distance, I heard gunshots. I turned for just a second and saw a man with a rifle, shooting the zombie several times until it fell.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t stick around to see what happened next. I kept running all the way home and locked myself in my room.\n\n\n\nThis morning I told everything to my mom. She just looked at me patiently and said I need to stop imagining things. She doesn\u2019t believe me.\n\n\n\nBut I know what I saw.\n\n\n\nAnd I know something terrible is happening on this island.\n\n\n\n\/\/\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since I saw the zombie. Mom and Dad have started acting strange\u2014they seem confused. They\u2019re still working normally, but now they wear protective suits when they go out. They told me some kind of toxin had spread across the island, so for safety, they had to go out protected. They\u2019ve forbidden me from leaving. I\u2019ve got my console to play with, but what I saw still terrifies me. What if there are more zombies? I try to distract myself with video games, but the image of that thing staggering along the beach won\u2019t leave me alone. Gal keeps me company, but even he seems uneasy.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, my parents came home. Along with their protective suits, I noticed they brought a lot of food. They said they grabbed everything they could from a nearby store. Dad asked me to store it all in the boat\u2019s pantry. While I did, I noticed something in his expression\u2014not just confusion anymore, but worry.\n\n\n\nBefore bed, I overheard a phone call from my dad. His words weren\u2019t calm.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t the money\u2014we did what they told us.\u201d Whoever was on the other end was clearly someone my dad didn\u2019t like.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t tell us what\u2019s going on, we won\u2019t be able to keep working. In the houses, some owners have fallen asleep and haven\u2019t woken up.\u201d\n\n\n\nApparently, my dad didn\u2019t get any response. He hung up the phone forcefully and rubbed his face with his hands, as if trying not to lose control. Mom approached him and they began whispering. I didn\u2019t want to hear any more. I went to my room, with Gal curled up next to my bed, trying to sleep.\n\n\n\nIn the morning, I noticed both my mom and dad had strong colds. Their faces were pale, they looked tired. My dad got up with difficulty, put on his protective suit, and said he had to check something. Before leaving, he checked the magazine of his revolver and holstered it on his belt.\n\n\n\nTwo hours passed. Mom got a call. It was Dad. I don\u2019t know what he said, but Mom became desperate. In a flash, she grabbed my arm, began checking my body, touched my forehead, looked at my arms, and kept asking if I felt sick. I told her no, that I was fine. Then she went to Gal and checked him too. She let out a small sigh of relief.\n\n\n\nAfter that, she called my dad again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat time are you coming back? We\u2019re not leaving without you.\u201d\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what he answered, but Mom began crying. Her hand trembled as she held the phone. She handed it to me so I could talk to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey champ, Daddy loves you. Something bad happened. Bad people made mistakes and now others are paying for it. Daddy will do everything he can to fix it. Listen to your mom.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe call cut off. I felt a knot in my throat. I cried. I\u2019d never heard my dad sound so sad. My mom hugged me tight. Afraid, I asked her:\n\n\n\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\n\nMom told me everything. Ever since I saw the zombie, something had changed on the island. They were told that some kind of virus had been released from one of the laboratories. It caused people who got infected to experience strong flu symptoms and extreme drowsiness; they would fall asleep and never wake up. The owners of the houses my parents were looking after had fallen asleep. My parents called their employers, who told them to keep working and even sent them payment in advance. So they did, going out to work wearing those protective suits.\n\n\n\nWhile working, my dad encountered a man walking strangely inside a house. He approached him and noticed the man was missing fingers on one hand. The man attacked him. My dad defended himself, the man fell, got up again, and tried to attack once more. My dad hit him repeatedly, but it didn\u2019t work. Scared, he ran out of the house and locked it behind him. He went to see the island's sheriff to report what had happened.\n\n\n\nThere were about ten police officers on the island, but that afternoon, no one was there. My dad had become friends with a scientist named Jack who lived nearby, and he called him. Jack told him the police were handling an emergency, that the virus was stronger than they thought, that they might evacuate the island or put it under quarantine, and that he should stock up on food just in case.\n\n\n\nMy dad came back from work with my mom. They went to the nearest store, but no one was there. They took everything they could carry. At this point, they were already terrified. They thought everything was going to fall apart.\n\n\n\nWhen they noticed they were sick, my dad called Jack again, but there was no answer. So he went to Jack\u2019s house, telling my mom that if he didn\u2019t return, we should leave.\n\n\n\nJack told him that the virus had actually escaped from the island\u2019s laboratories, that he was trying to create a possible vaccine that could only be synthesized in the island's underground lab. My dad followed him.\n\n\n\nMy dad discovered that the virus spread like the flu, and that we were all probably infected. So he called my mom. She panicked and checked that both Gal and I were okay. We didn\u2019t show any symptoms. My dad was trapped with monsters in the lab, and my mom was infected. She told me it was dangerous for her to stay with me.\n\n\n\nWith her last strength, she managed to get Gal and me onto the boat. She stayed behind on the island. She said that Dad would return and they would join us later. I used to sail with my dad, so I know how to handle the boat. I think I\u2019m doing well. The nights at sea are cold. I miss my parents. Gal is my only companion. I don\u2019t know how much time has passed. The food might last a couple of months. I hope to reach land soon or find another boat. If not, I\u2019m throwing this letter in a bottle. I hope someone finds it. If you see us, please help. Our boat is white with blue stripes.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEthan Brown\n\n\n\nThe  Igea island, that was another place where they experimented with human life.\n\nThe records and information about the place are scarce. Rumors and some notes from scientists found suggest that several experimental vaccines were synthesized there. All communication with the island was lost, so the only way to verify this is in person. Ethan\u2019s message was found a month ago near an observation tower. I checked the radars, but I didn\u2019t find any boat at sea.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Mishasho\n\n"},"90":{"title":"The House","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jslyif\/the_house\/","flair":null,"author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\n\"I had promised myself I\u2019d never go back there.\nSince that night, the house had remained shut, forgotten at the end of the road.\nBut time passed, and its silence turned into dust and cracks in the walls.\nThe real estate agent told me someone was interested in buying it.

It was a reminder.\nAnd I knew exactly what she meant.\n\nI went up to the attic.\nThere was an old rope tied to a beam.\nShe stood below, in the dark, watching.\nWith a slight nod of approval.\nAnd I\u2026 for a moment, I considered it.\n\nBut something stopped me.\nIt wasn\u2019t fear \u2014 not anymore.\nIt was a primal survival instinct.\nAnd when I hesitated, she disappeared.\n\nThe next day, something had changed.\nThe walls seemed narrower, like they were slowly closing in.\nThe hallway, which I remembered as short, grew longer each time I walked through it.\nThe kitchen door creaked on its own, even when locked.\nThe house was falling apart from the inside.\nOr adapting to what it had become.\n\nA prison made of guilt.\nAnd I was the prisoner.\nOr the visitor.\nOr maybe the last bit of living flesh she still needed.\nTo become whole.\n\nI tried to burn the house down.\nI built a fire with the curtains and furniture.\nBut the flames wouldn\u2019t rise.\nThey just danced low, like they were mocking me.\nShe wasn\u2019t going to let it happen.\n\nSo I screamed.\nI screamed everything I\u2019d kept inside for two years.\nThe truth.\nThat yes, I loved her.\nBut I never meant to promise what I couldn\u2019t keep.\n\nThat night, she appeared one last time.\nA figure standing at the foot of the bed.\nAnd for the first time\u2026 she was crying.\nBut said nothing.\n\nThe next morning, the front door was open.\nLight poured in like the world had returned to normal.\nI walked out without looking back.\nBut I know she\u2019s still in there.\nWaiting for me to keep my promise.\n\n\n\n\n"},"92":{"title":"I\u2019m a piano player for the rich and famous, My recent client demanded some strange things\u2026","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1js9s5f\/im_a_piano_player_for_the_rich_and_famous_my\/","flair":null,"author":"SocietysMenaceCC","selftext":"\nI've been playing piano for the wealthy for almost fifteen years now. Ever since graduating from Juilliard with a degree I couldn't afford and debt I couldn't manage, I found that my classical training was best suited for providing ambiance to those who viewed Bach and Chopin as mere background to their conversations about stock portfolios and vacation homes.\n\nMy name is Everett Carlisle. I am\u2014or was\u2014a pianist for the elite. I've played in penthouses overlooking Central Park, in Hamptons estates with ocean views that stretched to forever, on yachts anchored off the coast of Monaco, and in ballrooms where a single chandelier cost more than what most people make in five years.\n\nI'm writing this because I need to document what happened. I need to convince myself that I didn't imagine it all, though god knows I wish I had. I've been having trouble sleeping. Every time I close my eyes, I see their faces. I hear the sounds. I smell the... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt started three weeks ago with an email from a name I didn't recognize: Thaddeus Wexler. The subject line read \"Exclusive Engagement - Substantial Compensation.\" This wasn't unusual\u2014most of my clients found me through word of mouth or my website, and the wealthy often lead with money as if it's the only language that matters. Usually, they're right.\n\nThe email was brief and formal:\n\n*Mr. Carlisle,*\n\n*Your services have been recommended by a mutual acquaintance for a private gathering of considerable importance. The engagement requires absolute discretion and will be compensated at $25,000 for a single evening's performance. Should you be interested, please respond to confirm your availability for April 18th. A car will collect you at 7 PM sharp. Further details will be provided upon your agreement to our terms.*\n\n*Regards,*\n*Thaddeus Wexler*\n*The Ishtar Society*\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. For one night. I'd played for billionaires who balked at my usual rate of $2,000. This was either a joke or... well, I wasn't sure what else it could be. But curiosity got the better of me, and the balance in my checking account didn't hurt either. I responded the same day.\n\nTo my surprise, I received a call within an hour from a woman who identified herself only as Ms. Harlow. Her voice was crisp, professional, with that particular cadence that comes from years of managing difficult people and situations.\n\n\"Mr. Carlisle, thank you for your prompt response. Mr. Wexler was confident you would be interested in our offer. Before we proceed, I must emphasize the importance of discretion. The event you will be attending is private in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\n\"I understand. I've played for many private events. Confidentiality is standard in my contracts.\"\n\n\"This goes beyond standard confidentiality, Mr. Carlisle. The guests at this gathering value their privacy above all else. You will be required to sign additional agreements, including an NDA with substantial penalties.\"\n\nSomething about her tone made me pause. There was an edge to it, a warning barely contained beneath the professional veneer.\n\n\"What exactly is this event?\" I asked.\n\n\"An annual meeting of The Ishtar Society. It's a... philanthropic organization with a long history. The evening includes dinner, speeches, and a ceremony. Your role is to provide accompaniment throughout.\"\n\n\"What kind of music are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Classical, primarily. We'll provide a specific program closer to the date. Mr. Wexler has requested that you prepare Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, as well as selected pieces by Debussy and Satie.\"\n\nSimple enough requests. Still, something felt off.\n\n\"And the location?\"\n\n\"A private estate in the Hudson Valley. As mentioned, transportation will be provided. You'll be returned to your residence when the evening concludes.\"\n\nI hesitated, but the thought of $25,000\u2014enough to cover six months of my Manhattan rent\u2014pushed me forward.\n\n\"Alright. I'm in.\"\n\n\"Excellent. A courier will deliver paperwork tomorrow. Please sign all documents and return them with the courier. Failure to do so will nullify our arrangement.\"\n\nThe paperwork arrived as promised\u2014a thick manila envelope containing the most extensive non-disclosure agreement I'd ever seen. It went beyond the usual confidentiality clauses to include penalties for even discussing the existence of the event itself. I would forfeit not just my fee but potentially face a lawsuit for damages up to $5 million if I breached any terms.\n\nThere was also a list of instructions:\n\n1. Wear formal black attire (tuxedo, white shirt, black bow tie)\n2. Bring no electronic devices of any kind\n3. Do not speak unless spoken to\n4. Remain at the piano unless instructed otherwise\n5. Play only the music provided in the accompanying program\n6. Do not acknowledge guests unless they acknowledge you first\n\nThe last instruction was underlined: *What happens at the Society remains at the Society.*\n\nThe music program was enclosed as well\u2014a carefully curated selection of melancholy and contemplative pieces. Debussy's \"Clair de Lune,\" Satie's \"Gymnop\u00e9dies,\" several Chopin nocturnes and preludes, and Bach's \"Goldberg Variations.\" All beautiful pieces, but collectively they created a somber, almost funereal atmosphere.\n\nI should have walked away then. The money was incredible, yes, but everything about this felt wrong. However, like most people facing a financial windfall, I rationalized. Rich people are eccentric. Their parties are often strange, governed by antiquated rules of etiquette. This would just be another night playing for people who saw me as furniture with fingers.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\n---\n\nApril 18th arrived. At precisely 7 PM, a black Suburban with tinted windows pulled up outside my apartment building in Morningside Heights. The driver, a broad-shouldered man with a close-cropped haircut who introduced himself only as Reed, held the door open without a word.\n\nThe vehicle's interior was immaculate, with soft leather seats and a glass partition separating me from the driver. On the seat beside me was a small box with a card that read, \"Please put this on before we reach our destination.\" Inside was a black blindfold made of heavy silk.\n\nThis was crossing a line. \"Excuse me,\" I called to the driver. \"I wasn't informed about a blindfold.\"\n\nThe partition lowered slightly. \"Mr. Wexler's instructions, sir. Security protocols. I can return you to your residence if you prefer, but the engagement would be canceled.\"\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. I put on the blindfold.\n\nWe drove for what felt like two hours, though I couldn't be certain. The roads eventually became less smooth\u2014we were no longer on a highway but winding through what I assumed were rural roads. Finally, the vehicle slowed and came to a stop. I heard gravel crunching beneath tires, then silence as the engine was turned off.\n\n\"We've arrived, Mr. Carlisle. You may remove the blindfold now.\"\n\nI blinked as my eyes adjusted to the fading daylight. Before me stood what could only be described as a mansion, though that word seemed insufficient. It was a sprawling stone structure that looked like it belonged in the English countryside rather than upstate New York. Gothic in design, with towering spires and large windows that reflected the sunset in hues of orange and red. The grounds were immaculate\u2014perfectly manicured gardens, stone fountains, and pathways lined with unlit torches.\n\nReed escorted me to a side entrance, where we were met by a slender woman in a black dress. Her hair was pulled back so tightly it seemed to stretch her pale skin.\n\n\"Mr. Carlisle. I'm Ms. Harlow. We spoke on the phone.\" Her handshake was brief and cold. \"The guests will begin arriving shortly. I'll show you to the ballroom where you'll be performing.\"\n\nWe walked through service corridors, avoiding what I assumed were the main halls of the house. The decor was old money\u2014oil paintings in gilt frames, antique furniture, Persian rugs on hardwood floors. Everything spoke of wealth accumulated over generations.\n\nThe ballroom was vast, with a ceiling that rose at least thirty feet, adorned with elaborate plasterwork and a chandelier that must have held a hundred bulbs. At one end was a raised platform where a gleaming black Steinway grand piano waited. The room was otherwise empty, though dozens of round tables with black tablecloths had been arranged across the polished floor, each set with fine china, crystal, and silver.\n\n\"You'll play from here,\" Ms. Harlow said, leading me to the piano. \"The program is on the stand. Please familiarize yourself with the sequence. Timing is important this evening.\"\n\nI looked at the program again. It was the same selection I'd been practicing, but now each piece had specific timing noted beside it. The Chopin Nocturne was marked for 9:45 PM, with \"CRITICAL\" written in red beside it.\n\n\"What happens at 9:45?\" I asked.\n\nMs. Harlow's expression didn't change. \"The ceremony begins. Mr. Wexler will signal you.\" She checked her watch. \"It's 7:30 now. Guests will begin arriving at 8. There's water on the side table. Please help yourself, but I must remind you not to leave the piano area under any circumstances once the first guest arrives.\"\n\n\"What if I need to use the restroom?\"\n\n\"Use it now. Once you're at the piano, you remain there until the evening concludes.\"\n\n\"How long will that be?\"\n\n\"Until it's over.\" Her tone made it clear that was all the information I would receive. \"One final thing, Mr. Carlisle. No matter what you see or hear tonight, you are to continue playing. Do not stop until Mr. Wexler indicates the evening has concluded. Is that clear?\"\n\nA chill ran through me. \"What exactly am I going to see or hear?\"\n\nHer eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw something like pity. \"The Ishtar Society has traditions that may seem... unusual to outsiders. Your job is to play, not to understand. Remember that, and you'll leave with your fee and without complications.\"\n\nWith that cryptic warning, she left me alone in the massive room.\n\nI sat at the piano, testing the keys. The instrument was perfectly tuned, responsive in a way that only comes from regular maintenance by master technicians. Under different circumstances, I would have been thrilled to play such a fine piano.\n\nOver the next half hour, staff began to enter\u2014servers in formal attire, security personnel positioned discreetly around the perimeter, and technicians adjusting lighting. No one spoke to me or even looked in my direction.\n\nAt precisely 8 PM, the main doors opened, and the first guests began to arrive.\n\nThey entered in pairs and small groups, all impeccably dressed in formal evening wear. The men in tailored tuxedos, the women in gowns that likely cost more than most cars. But what struck me immediately was how they moved\u2014with a practiced grace that seemed almost choreographed, and with expressions that betrayed neither joy nor anticipation, but something closer to solemn reverence.\n\nI began to play as instructed, starting with Bach's \"Goldberg Variations.\" The acoustics in the room were perfect, the notes resonating clearly throughout the space. As I played, I observed the guests. They were uniformly affluent, but diverse in age and ethnicity. Some I recognized\u2014a tech billionaire known for his controversial data mining practices, a former cabinet secretary who'd left politics for private equity, the heiress to a pharmaceutical fortune, a film director whose work had grown increasingly disturbing over the years.\n\nThey mingled with practiced smiles that never reached their eyes. Servers circulated with champagne and hors d'oeuvres, but I noticed that many guests barely touched either. There was an air of anticipation, of waiting.\n\nAt 8:30, a hush fell over the room as a tall, silver-haired man entered. Even from a distance, his presence commanded attention. This, I assumed, was Thaddeus Wexler. He moved through the crowd, accepting deferential nods and brief handshakes. He didn't smile either.\n\nDinner was served at precisely 8:45, just as I transitioned to Debussy. The conversation during the meal was subdued, lacking the usual animated chatter of high-society gatherings. These people weren't here to network or be seen. They were here for something else.\n\nAt 9:30, as I began Satie's first \"Gymnop\u00e9die,\" the doors opened again. A new group entered, but these were not guests. They were... different.\n\nAbout twenty people filed in, escorted by security personnel. They were dressed in simple white clothing\u2014loose pants and tunics that looked almost medical. They moved uncertainly, some stumbling slightly. Their expressions ranged from confusion to mild fear. Most notably, they looked... ordinary. Not wealthy. Not polished. Regular people who seemed completely out of place in this setting.\n\nThe guests watched their entrance with an intensity that made my fingers falter on the keys. I quickly recovered, forcing myself to focus on the music rather than the bizarre scene unfolding before me.\n\nThe newcomers were led to the center of the room, where they stood in a loose cluster, looking around with increasing unease. Some attempted to speak to their escorts but were met with stony silence.\n\nAt 9:43, Thaddeus Wexler rose from his seat at the central table. The room fell completely silent except for my playing. He raised a crystal glass filled with dark red liquid.\n\n\"Friends,\" his voice was deep, resonant. \"We gather once more in service to the Great Balance. For prosperity, there must be sacrifice. For abundance, there must be scarcity. For us to rise, others must fall. It has always been so. It will always be so.\"\n\nThe guests raised their glasses in unison. \"To the Balance,\" they intoned.\n\nWexler turned to face the group in white. \"You have been chosen to serve a purpose greater than yourselves. Your sacrifice sustains our world. For this, we are grateful.\"\n\nI was now playing Chopin's Nocturne, the piece marked \"CRITICAL\" on my program. My hands moved automatically while my mind raced to understand what was happening. Sacrifice? What did that mean?\n\nOne of the people in white, a middle-aged man with thinning hair, stepped forward. \"You said this was about a job opportunity. You said\u2014\"\n\nA security guard moved swiftly, pressing something to the man's neck that made him crumple to his knees, gasping.\n\nWexler continued as if there had been no interruption. \"Tonight, we renew our covenant. Tonight, we ensure another year of prosperity.\"\n\nAs the Nocturne reached its middle section, the mood in the room shifted palpably. The guests rose from their tables and formed a circle around the confused group in white. Each guest produced a small obsidian knife from inside their formal wear.\n\nMy blood ran cold, but I kept playing. Ms. Harlow's words echoed in my mind: *No matter what you see or hear tonight, you are to continue playing.*\n\n\"Begin,\" Wexler commanded.\n\nWhat happened next will haunt me until my dying day. The guests moved forward in unison, each selecting one of the people in white. There was a moment of confused struggle before the guards restrained the victims. Then, with practiced precision, each guest made a small cut on their chosen victim's forearm, collecting drops of blood in their crystal glasses.\n\nThis wasn't a massacre as I had initially feared\u2014it was something more ritualized, more controlled, but no less disturbing. The people in white were being used in some sort of blood ritual, their fear and confusion providing a stark contrast to the methodical actions of the wealthy guests.\n\nAfter collecting the blood, the guests returned to the circle, raising their glasses once more.\n\n\"With this offering, we bind our fortunes,\" Wexler intoned. \"With their essence, we ensure our ascension.\"\n\nThe guests drank from their glasses. All of them. They drank the blood of strangers as casually as one might sip champagne.\n\nI felt bile rise in my throat but forced myself to continue playing. The Nocturne transitioned to its final section, my fingers trembling slightly on the keys.\n\nThe people in white were led away, looking dazed and frightened. I noticed something else\u2014small bandages on their arms, suggesting this wasn't the first \"collection\" they had endured.\n\nAs the last notes of the Nocturne faded, Wexler turned to face me directly for the first time. His eyes were dark, calculating. He gave a small nod, and I moved on to the next piece as instructed.\n\nThe remainder of the evening proceeded with a surreal normalcy. The guests resumed their seats, dessert was served, and conversation gradually returned, though it remained subdued. No one mentioned what had just occurred. No one seemed disturbed by it. It was as if they had simply performed a routine business transaction rather than participated in a blood ritual.\n\nI played mechanically, my mind racing. Who were those people in white? Where had they come from? What happened to them after they were led away? The questions pounded in my head in rhythm with the music.\n\nAt 11:30, Wexler rose again. \"The covenant is renewed. Our path is secured for another year. May prosperity continue to flow to those who understand its true cost.\"\n\nThe guests applauded politely, then began to depart in the same orderly fashion they had arrived. Within thirty minutes, only Wexler, Ms. Harlow, and a few staff remained in the ballroom.\n\nWexler approached the piano as I finished the final piece on the program.\n\n\"Excellent performance, Mr. Carlisle. Your reputation is well-deserved.\" His voice was smooth, cultured.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I managed, struggling to keep my expression neutral. \"May I ask what I just witnessed?\"\n\nA slight smile curved his lips. \"You witnessed nothing, Mr. Carlisle. That was our arrangement. You played beautifully, and now you will return home, twenty-five thousand dollars richer, with nothing but the memory of providing music for an exclusive gathering.\"\n\n\"Those people\u2014\"\n\n\"Are participating in a medical trial,\" he interrupted smoothly. \"Quite voluntarily, I assure you. They're compensated generously for their... contributions. Much as you are for yours.\"\n\nI didn't believe him. Couldn't believe him. But I also understood the implicit threat in his words. I had signed their documents. I had agreed to their terms.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"I was merely curious about the unusual ceremony.\"\n\n\"Curiosity is natural,\" Wexler replied. \"Acting on it would be unwise. I trust you understand the difference.\"\n\nMs. Harlow appeared at his side, holding an envelope. \"Your payment, Mr. Carlisle, as agreed. The car is waiting to take you back to the city.\"\n\nI took the envelope, feeling its substantial weight. \"Thank you for the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we'll call on you again,\" Wexler said, though his tone made it clear this was unlikely. \"Remember our terms, Mr. Carlisle. What happens at the Society\u2014\"\n\n\"Remains at the Society,\" I finished.\n\n\"Indeed. Good night.\"\n\nReed was waiting by the same black Suburban. Once again, I was asked to don the blindfold for the return journey. As we drove through the night, I clutched the envelope containing my fee and tried to process what I had witnessed.\n\nIt wasn't until I was back in my apartment, counting the stacks of hundred-dollar bills, that the full impact hit me. I ran to the bathroom and vomited until there was nothing left.\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. The price of my silence. The cost of my complicity.\n\nI've spent the past three weeks trying to convince myself that there was a reasonable explanation for what I saw. That Wexler was telling the truth about medical trials. That the whole thing was some elaborate performance art for the jaded ultra-wealthy.\n\nBut I know better. Those people in white weren't volunteers. Their confusion and fear were genuine. And the way the guests consumed their blood with such reverence, such practiced ease... this wasn't their first \"ceremony.\"\n\nI've tried researching The Ishtar Society, but found nothing. Not a mention, not a whisper. As if it doesn't exist. I've considered going to the police, but what would I tell them? That I witnessed rich people drinking a few drops of blood in a ritual? Without evidence, without even being able to say where this mansion was located, who would believe me?\n\nAnd then there's the NDA. Five million dollars in penalties. They would ruin me. And based on what I saw, financial ruin might be the least of my concerns if I crossed them.\n\nSo I've remained silent. Until now. Writing this down is a risk, but I need to document what happened before I convince myself it was all a dream.\n\nLast night, I received another email:\n\n*Mr. Carlisle,*\n\n*Your services are requested for our Winter Solstice gathering on December 21st. The compensation will be doubled for your return engagement. A car will collect you at 7 PM.*\n\n*The Society was pleased with your performance and discretion.*\n\n*Regards,*\n*Thaddeus Wexler*\n*The Ishtar Society*\n\nFifty thousand dollars. For one night of playing piano while the elite perform their blood rituals.\n\nI should delete the email. I should move apartments, change my name, disappear.\n\nBut fifty thousand dollars...\n\nAnd a part of me, a dark, curious part I never knew existed, wants to go back. To understand what I witnessed. To know what happens to those people in white after they're led away. To learn what the \"Great Balance\" truly means.\n\nI have until December to decide. Until then, I'll keep playing at regular society parties, providing background music for the merely wealthy rather than the obscenely powerful. I'll smile and nod and pretend I'm just a pianist, nothing more.\n\nBut every time I close my eyes, I see Wexler raising his glass. I hear his words about sacrifice and balance. And I wonder\u2014how many others have been in my position? How many witnessed the ceremony and chose money over morality? How many returned for a second performance?\n\nAnd most troubling of all: if I do go back, will I ever be allowed to leave again?\n\nThe winter solstice is approaching. I have a decision to make. The Ishtar Society is waiting for my answer."},"93":{"title":"Lights Out","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jsieqk\/lights_out\/","flair":null,"author":"fallenArcanum","selftext":"Here's an existential horror story for you: \n\nImagine you've had a bit of a rough start to life. I'm sure, for the lucky few who landed over here, that isn't too far of a stretch. \n\nThough despite the many odds stacked against you, the many voices prattling in your ear, at some point by your mid-twenties, you start getting it together- establishing something almost like a real sense of who you are. \n\nSure, you're carrying most of the weight sometimes, you are a package deal after all. You and the 30-something stowaways living in your head. \nBut you find a balance, a rhythm, you build a life for yourself, one where you feel seen for who you are, and there's space for everyone.  \n\nAnd then, lights out. \n\nYou're a prisoner in your own mind, and someone else is at the wheel, someone you never made the time to learn to trust. Someone you in fact- don't entirely trust. \nThey're an unwilling participant in your replacement. \n\nYou have no choice, you've become a voice in someone else's head for a change, in the farthest, darkest corner in the back, where you're less a voice, and more a whisper. The others help you to your feet as much as they can, and send you up the path, back toward the light, at the front.\n\nA month has passed and the lights have come back on, there are a few fires to put out, the world hasn't ended- though you feel closer to it than comfort, your unwilling replacement has managed to keep your life mostly together, in fact, they've surprised you- they live a little differently than you did. They're softer, sweeter. Nothing like what you would've expected from a scream at the back of your mind.  You must give credit where credit is due. People have been asking for you though, so you think: I can rebuild from here.\n\nAnd then, lights out. \n\nThis time, after your eyes adjust, you think: \"clearly this is a matter of inner light. Something needs to be repaired, within myself.\" You devote the time you're stuck in the dark, to try and understand where your own darkness comes from. You're not a whisper anymore, hardly a breath, so you try and find the light within yourself. It's hard to say whether you do or don't, but the lights come back on by themselves eventually, you cautiously step into it.\n\nAnother month has passed, this time the passage of time doesn't feel quite real, it sort of blends at the edge. So much has changed in the life you built, you find that you're disoriented stepping into your old role. Your replacement has stepped into that role themself, all too comfortably, and your new surroundings reflect that, so it's going to take some work to re-establish your footing. People are surprised to hear from you, but happy nonetheless. You make light out of the situation, to help search for traces of what used to be yours. You want to be sure of what you still have- and what you haven't lost in the dark. \n\nAnd then, lights out.\n\nIt's a hopeless sort of darkness now, nobody left inside has any motivation or belief, god knows that you don't. You aren't a whisper or a breath or anything at all.\nYou use the dark as what it's intended for, and close your eyes. \n\nThis time, when waking into the life you've built, time has lost almost all meaning. Months have passed, and nothing is as you left it. You can hardly recognise your surroundings, much less yourself, They've stopped asking about you, by the way. They don't mean any harm, they've simply forgotten.\nYes, you're basically a fun party trick. The way you're plucked from dream to reality. Where are the lines? Where are the boundaries you set? What still matters when you've disappeared- but nobody cares, because your body still lives and breathes beside them? You aren't sure what's left to do... Aside from drowning your sorrows, covering your eyes, and waiting for the next- \n\nLights out."},"95":{"title":"I Took a Job as a Test Subject.

Someone was watching me. I told myself it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nFor the first few hours, nothing happened. They gave me food\u2014plain, flavorless, but edible. The lights never dimmed, so I had no real way of knowing when night fell. A voice over an intercom instructed me to document any changes in perception. I wrote: \u201cNothing yet.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know when I fell asleep. The next thing I remember is waking up to the sound of something moving in the room.\n\nI sat up, heart hammering, but I was alone. The door was still locked, the mirror reflecting my own wide-eyed face. I took a breath, told myself it was my imagination. Maybe I\u2019d kicked the bed in my sleep.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nMy reflection hadn\u2019t moved.\n\nI was sitting upright, breathing heavily, but the me in the mirror was still lying down, eyes shut.\n\nI scrambled off the bed, my pulse roaring in my ears. My reflection stayed where it was for a second longer before it jolted upright, as if catching up to me.\n\nI backed away until I hit the far wall. My reflection did the same.\n\nThe intercom crackled. \u201cPlease describe any changes in perception.\u201d\n\nMy mouth was dry. My hands were shaking. I forced myself to breathe, to think.\n\n\u201cIt lagged,\u201d I finally said. \u201cMy reflection. It didn\u2019t move when I did.\u201d\n\nSilence. Then the intercom clicked off.\n\nI stared at the mirror, half expecting my reflection to move on its own again. It didn\u2019t. It looked normal now. Maybe I imagined it. Maybe it was exhaustion.\n\nI turned away, climbed back into bed. The sheets felt cold, almost damp. I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the sensation that I wasn\u2019t alone in the room.\n\nThat was the first night.\n\nI should have left then.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep that night. How could I? Every movement felt unnatural, my own body betraying me in the dim light of the small room. I tried convincing myself it was fatigue, paranoia, or a trick of the light. But I wasn\u2019t stupid. Shadows don\u2019t move on their own.\n\nAt some point, exhaustion won. I woke up to a room bathed in artificial white. The overhead light never turned off, and I had no sense of time. My mouth was dry. The air hummed with a low, constant vibration I hadn\u2019t noticed before.\n\nI sat up and stared at the floor. My shadow was still there, still mine. But something was off.\n\nIt was breathing.\n\nNo, not breathing exactly. But expanding, contracting, shifting in a way that had nothing to do with me. My pulse hammered in my throat. I lifted a hand. It followed\u2014but that half-second lag was worse now. Deliberate.\n\nThe intercom clicked. \"Describe your shadow.\"\n\nMy voice came out hoarse. \"It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s slower than before. It\u2019s moving by itself.\"\n\nA pause. Then: \"Do not be alarmed. This is a normal response.\"\n\n\"Normal?\" I snapped. \"What the hell kind of study is this? What did you do to me?\"\n\nSilence. Then, the door unlocked with a soft click.\n\nI stood, my body tense. No one entered. No instructions followed. Just an open door, yawning like a trap.\n\nI stepped forward. My shadow didn\u2019t move.\n\nI ran.\n\nThe hallway was empty. No scientists, no security\u2014just me and the steady hum of unseen machinery. The overhead lights buzzed, casting long, sterile pools of brightness against the cold floor.\n\nI glanced down. My shadow hadn\u2019t followed.\n\nIt still lay in my room, frozen against the floor like a discarded thing. My stomach twisted. That wasn\u2019t how shadows worked.\n\nA flickering movement at the edge of my vision made me spin. Down the hall, a shadow pooled unnaturally, stretching along the wall in a way that ignored the angles of the light. It wasn\u2019t mine.\n\nI walked faster. Then faster still. Every door I passed looked the same\u2014windowless, unmarked. Was anyone else in here? Had there been other test subjects?\n\nA voice crackled over the intercom. \u201cReturn to your room.\u201d\n\nI ignored it.\n\n\u201cReturn to your room.\u201d\n\nThe air shifted\u2014something behind me. I turned, but nothing was there. My chest tightened. My feet moved on instinct. Faster. I needed to get out.\n\nA door at the end of the hall had a red exit sign above it. My heart leapt. I ran, my breath loud in my ears. But as I reached for the handle, the hallway lights flickered.\n\nAnd my shadow slammed into me.\n\nI felt it. Cold. Solid. Like a second skin wrapping around my body. I gasped, stumbling backward. My limbs stiffened, and for one horrible second, I wasn\u2019t in control. My arms twitched\u2014moved in ways I hadn\u2019t willed.\n\nThen, it let go.\n\nI collapsed to my knees, sucking in air. My shadow\u2014if it was still mine\u2014was back where it belonged, stretched thin beneath me. But something was different.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t lagging anymore.\n\nIt was leading.\n\nThe intercom buzzed again, softer this time. \u201cYou\u2019ve progressed to the next phase.\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard. My fingers curled against the cold floor.\n\nI had a feeling I wasn\u2019t the one being studied anymore.\n\nI sat there, my palms pressing against the icy floor, trying to steady my breath. My shadow was still. But it didn\u2019t feel like mine anymore.\n\nThe intercom crackled again. \u201cYou are experiencing a temporary adjustment period. Do not be alarmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdjustment?\u201d My voice was raw. \u201cWhat the hell is happening to me?\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\nI turned back toward the exit. The door was still there, but now, something about it felt off. The edges blurred, like heat waves distorting the air. I reached out, fingers brushing the metal handle\u2014\n\nThe hallway flickered.\n\nNot the lights. The space itself.\n\nFor a split second, I wasn\u2019t in the hallway. I was somewhere else. A darker place, where walls pulsed like living things and shadows slithered unnaturally across the floor.\n\nThen it was gone. I was back in the hallway, the exit door solid beneath my hand.\n\nI stumbled away from it, chest heaving. My shadow rippled beneath me, as if it had seen what I had.\n\n\u201cReturn to your room.\u201d The voice was softer now. Almost\u2026 coaxing.\n\nI shook my head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\nThe moment I said it, the lights overhead flared, casting my shadow long and sharp against the floor. It twitched. Shifted.\n\nThen it rose.\n\nI scrambled back as my own darkness peeled itself away, standing upright in front of me. It had my shape, my outline\u2014but it wasn\u2019t *me*. The head tilted, mimicking the way I moved, but with an eerie delay.\n\nMy pulse pounded.\n\nThe shadow took a step forward.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nThe hallway stretched longer than it should have, like I was running through a nightmare where the exit never came closer. My breath hitched. My legs ached. I dared a glance over my shoulder\u2014\n\nIt was following. Fast.\n\nI reached another door\u2014any door\u2014and yanked it open. I threw myself inside, slamming it behind me. My hands fumbled for a lock, but there was none.\n\nThe room was dark, the air thick with something stale and wrong. I turned\u2014\n\nAnd froze.\n\nI wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nShapes loomed in the darkness. Shadows. Some standing. Some crouched. All shifting unnaturally.\n\nI backed against the door, my breath coming in short gasps.\n\nThe intercom crackled once more, but this time, the voice had changed. It was layered, as if more than one person\u2014*or thing*\u2014was speaking at once.\n\n\u201cYou were never meant to leave.\"\n\n"},"97":{"title":"UNSTILL. \/\/ 4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jqhei3\/unstill_4\/","flair":null,"author":"Kind_Negotiation_301","selftext":"I check my phone again. 8:48 AM.

No slowing down.\n\nBecause he can\u2019t feel tired.\n\nThe realization sends a chill up my spine.\n\nHis arms pump, his legs move, his body performs the actions of struggle.

Maybe even a movie star.\n\nFeeling excited, I took a look at the information screen.\n\n\u201c*I was born a female in Glasgow, UK.*\u201d\n\nMy eyes went wide as I double-checked the location. I was born in Glasgow. \n\nMy excitement slowly faded to a dull sense of dread as I continued to read.\n\n\u201c*Born 28 November.*\u201d Same day as me.\n\nThe feeling of dread grew as I read the names of the parents. \n\n\"*David Thatcher, writer. (age 29)*\"\n\"*Willow Thatcher, police officer. (age 27)*\"\n\nThose are my parents names. \n\nMy dad was a writer, and my mom was a police officer back in those days. I quickly did the math, and the ages also matched. \n\nWith shaking hands, I clicked \"Age up\". \n\n\"*Age: 1 year. My mother and father had a baby boy named Jenson.*\"\n\nMy blood turned to ice as I read the text again. \n\n\"No way.\" I said to myself over and over, unable to believe that this is really happening. My stomach wrenched itself into knots as I thought of my poor, sweet brother. \n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\nNothing showed up for Age 2 and 3. With each blank screen, the feeling of dread that sat inside me eased up just a little. I tried to imagine what the odds of all this being a coincidence was. Probably impossibly low. \n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age 4: your parents want to buy you and your brother a pet spaniel named Daphne!*\" \n\nI let out a shriek as I dropped my phone and scrambled to the other side of the couch. I fell off the edge, my butt hitting the cold, tiled floor. \n\nI sat there for a bit, curled up and taking deep breaths. I remembered Daphne's sweet, brown eyes and golden coat. My parents got her for Jenson and I when I was four. She was my sweet angel, my best friend for five years. \n\nI sat on the floor for a few seconds more, as the weight in my stomach eased up enough for me to get up. I went to the kitchen, grabbed a glass from the cabinet and poured myself some water. \n\nI leaned against the counter, taking slow sips as the feeling of dread faded little by little. \n\nI placed the empty glass in the sink and turned the hot water on, grabbing the sponge and dish soap as the water heated up. Still in a daze, I cleaned the glass, rinsing off the suds and placing it on the rack to dry. \n\nI think I'm just tired. Overworked and delusional from working a double shift. I'll just turn off the game and go to bed. \n\nI jumped as a 'Ping!' sounded from the lounge. It's my phone, letting me know I had a message. \n\nI made my way to the lounge, sitting back on the couch as I picked up my phone and glanced at its screen. \n\nBitlife was still open, it's text waiting patiently for me as I swiped down and checked the notification. \n\nIt was from Bitlife. \"*Don't leave just yet!*\" it said. \n\n\"You must be losing your mind, Rita.\" I told myself, as I clicked \"Age up\", bracing myself for whatever came next. \n\n\"It's just a game.\" I tried to tell myself. It didn't help. \n\n\"*Age: 6 years. My dad is now addicted to alcohol.*\"\n\nI tried to lock the phone, my hands fumbling over the button over and over in a panic. The screen refused to lock, the text becoming blurry as I started to cry. \n\nIn frustration, I threw my phone across the room. It gave a loud **Crack!** as it bounced against the wall, it's screen ripping off and hanging from the main body. \n\nThe phone started pinging. Slowly at first, but picking up speed until it became a torrent of noise. \n\nMechanically, I made my way over to it, delicately picking up the screen as its cabling snapped off and left the main body behind. \n\nImpossibly, notifications flooded across the top of its lit screen. \"Don't leave just yet, Rita!\" it said, all from Bitlife. I watched as they flickered by. \n\nSuddenly they stopped, one final message popping up from the Text app. \n\nIt was from my dad. \n\n\"*Keep playing, Rita.*\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 7 years. My brother Jenson died at the age of 6.*\"\n\nMy eyesight became more blurry as tears flowed down my face. \n\n\"*He died in a car crash.*\"\n\nMy dad was driving that car. He picked him up from nursery school and was on his way to pick me up from my school when it happened. It was a head-on collision. \n\nThe police found my dad over the limit, and halfway across the other lane. \n\nAnother notification, this time from my mom. \n\n\"*Keep going!*\" \n\nNumbly, I clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 8 years. My mom died at the age of 35.*\"\n\nThe phones speakers came to life from the other side of the room, giving me a start. Two voices flooded out of it. \n\nIt's been years, but I recognized my parent's voices. \n\nIt started out hushed, both of them whispering to each other so as to not wake little Rita. Soon the voices grew louder and louder, filling the living room as they screamed angrily at each other. \n\nI cupped my ears, trying to drown out the sounds. It grew louder, the noise filling the room until I screamed, trying to drown them out. \n\nSuddenly it stopped. A door slammed and the sound of heavy footsteps marched away. \n\nI heard someone open a kitchen drawer, the utensils clanging together inside it as someone rifled around. \n\nThey pulled something out, slamming the drawer shut as they made their way back to where they came. \n\nI heard another 'Ping!' come from my phone. \n\n\"*She was stabbed by my father during an argument.*\" \n\nThe screaming turned my blood to ice. \n\nIt started off loud and shrill, the sound reverberating throughout the house. It started becoming hoarse and choked, before cutting off to a gargling silence. \n\nI cupped my hands over my ears, dropping the screen as I curled into a ball. \n\nI began screaming, telling it to stop as the sounds of my dad's labored breathing joined the sounds of his knife. \n\nSuddenly it cut off with another 'Ping!'. As my vision returned, I looked up at the screen. \n\n\"*Keep playing, Rita.*\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 9 years. My father committed suicide in prison at age 38. I've been sent to an orphanage.*\"\n\nI clicked again. \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 13 years. I was adopted by Adam Whiteley and Sarah Whiteley.*\"\n\nAnother 'Ping!'. \n\n\"*Almost there.*\"\n\n\"*Age: 15 years. My adoptive father hit me for not finishing dinner.*\"\n\n'Ping!'. \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 18 years. I ran away from home.*\"\n\n\"*Age: 19 years. I got a job as a barista.*\"\n\n\"*Age: 20 years.\"\n\n\"*22 years*\" \n\n25.\n\nMy breathing is shallow, my head is fuzzy and my hands are shaking as I stare at the screen. \n\n25 years. \n\nI turned 26 today. \n\nI jumped as I heard another 'Ping!'. \n\n\"*Almost there.*\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\nThe black 'Death' screen popped up. \"*Rita Thatcher died at the age of 26*\"\n\nI screamed as I heard my front door creak open. \n\n[\"*She was killed while at home.*\"](r\/DoopleWrites)"},"204":{"title":"The first part to a short horror comic I\u2019m writing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/lk12id","flair":null,"author":"adamcurrie7734","selftext":""},"210":{"title":"TRUE Scary Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/b6aea1\/true_scary_story\/","flair":null,"author":"griff1214","selftext":"My name is Michael and I'm a 14 year old boy who lives with my aunt in the countryside. Now out here we have no neighbors, the closest place to my house is about 8 miles away. I always loved living out here because I've always liked the seclusion and the road we live by is always dead at night, which makes for good sleep. Now my aunt is always working the night shift. So this means I would be home alone pretty much every night. Long story short I came home from school on a relatively crappy day, thunderstorms and rain all day and all night and spent my day playing video games and snapchatting my friends. At about 9 o'clock my aunt came upstairs and told me she was heading off to her job. I was always fine with this because I liked being home alone, I had full range of the house and could play loud music all I wanted. Who wouldn\u2019t love it? At about 11 o'clock I had started feeling tired and laid down to watch some youtube and go to sleep. And soon enough, I did. I woke up at some odd hour of the night to somebody knocking on the door. I sat up and muttered, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I thought my aunt had got home from the night shift and reluctantly went to go answer the door and out of habit, checked the window beside the door to make sure it was her. But there was nobody there. I thought to myself \u201cProbably some stupid kids knocking on my door and running away.\u201d And I dismissed it at that and went back into my room. I checked my phone to realize it was 3 am and the thought of teenagers ding dong ditching my home was suddenly out of the question given that it was a Wednesday, and I basically lived in the middle of nowhere. Just as I was thinking I heard a bang coming from the basement. I jumped and tried to make up an excuse like a noise of the thunderstorm to calm me down. We always kept our basement door locked anyway out of my aunt's paranoia and fear of someone breaking in. That's when I heard footsteps slowly creaking up the old wooden stairs in my basement. Frozen with fear I grabbed my phone and called 911. The operator told me to go to an upstairs room in the house and grab a weapon to defend myself. But there was no way I was going to grab a knife from the kitchen, especially when I heard the door being slammed and quickly realized that someone was trying to bust it down. I jumped from my bed and closed my door quietly and hid in my closet like the 911 operator had told me to do. This was easily the scariest moment of my life but suddenly, the banging stopped. But what comes next will haunt me for my whole life. Whoever it was screamed at the top of their lungs. But it wasn\u2019t a normal scream, it was an insane and disgruntled scream. And then, I heard the basement door collapse. Now he was full out screaming as he sprinted up the stairs. He went through all the rooms down the upstairs hallway (still screaming) until he reached mine. My door, unfortunately, didn\u2019t have a lock on it and when I heard him open my door, I was paralyzed with fear. I could see him through the shades of my closet, he was still screaming, looking all over my room, even under my bed. But then after trying to hold my breath for too long, I let out a puff of air. He perked up, looked straight at my closet and slowly walked towards it, no longer screaming. I couldn\u2019t even breathe at the moment. Especially when he just stopped right in front of the closet door. I could see him through the closet. And he had the biggest smile I had ever seen. As soon as he slowly reached for the closet door knob, there was a loud bang at the door and somebody yelling \u201cPolice!\u201d The man quickly ran and tried to run out my window but failed. As soon as I saw the police tackle him I instantly ran out of the closet and outside (now realizing that was a stupid move on my part). After a couple of minutes I saw the police bring the man out in cuffs but on the way to the car, he stared at me with the biggest smile and the craziest eyes I had ever seen. Watching him ride away with the police was the greatest moment of my life. But, what still haunts me today, is the face he made as he was standing in front of my closet door, ready to do something horrible."},"215":{"title":"Please Read Before Posting!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/7b31h8\/please_read_before_posting\/","flair":null,"author":"YugiohKing","selftext":"Hello Horror Story Readers!

And It Happened During Training.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/bxy44b\/this_is_my_scariest_911_call_and_it_happened\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"I needed the job. I really did. Without a bachelor's, my previous nursing work hadn't paid much. Overall, I took the stress and abuse while barely making over minimum wage. Just enough for me and my four-year-old son Julian to get by. \n\nSo yeah. Life as a single black mother wasn't exactly easy. I found myself being fueled by internal drive rather than joy or comfortable cash. Only I wasn't a struggling mother in her mid-to-late 40s. I was 23. \n\nWhile most of my friends and co-workers could go to college or party on the weekends, I was caught in a jail of long hours and tight budgets. An even more frustrating lifestyle since I lived in a vibrant bigger city like Columbus, Georgia. I could never hit the bars or Hell, just go out and meet hot guys. The fun with Julian became my only breaks from this stressful working-class prison sentence.\n\nBut still. I tried. Even through my binge-eating and drinking, I stayed at an average weight. While I may have been forced to mature beyond my years, my looks hadn't caught up with my \"old\" mindset. I was still a pretty young woman. I had nice cheekbones accompanied by a pair of sultry lips. My eyes big and radiant. Whenever I had the time, I'd even work out or straighten my long black hair. Only those moments were few and far between while I was in nursing... Yet somehow, I persevered. I dressed well without being boujee. I was strong and independent without being a ratchet bitch. I stayed friendly and optimistic regardless of my fading sanity.\n\nAnd then finally, it happened. I got the callback. A job offer to go somewhere higher than this Hell. I was gonna be a 911 call taker. As crazy as it sounds, the schedule would be less draining. The pay much better. And working for the Columbus Police Department meant I'd get all sorts of benefits. Not to mention the chance to grow through various promotions. \n\nOf course, I knew this was gonna be stressful. I'd heard all the horror stories from both former call takers I knew and from the literal horror stories I'd seen on Reddit. But I had to think of Julian. I'd now have more time with him. Less time being underpaid, angry, and fucking tired. Chrysta Heyes could now *live*.\n\nThe only problem was training. This shit was gonna take eight weeks. Eight weeks stuck in a classroom. Monday through Friday, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. Obviously, I wanted to be prepared before being thrown to the snarling wolves assaulting our 911 hotlines. But shit, it was boring! We had to go over countless textbooks, all the protocols, even take a crash course in CPR. Not to mention the hours and hours of \"role play.\" \n\nLike a dull drama class full of amateur hacks, my classmates and I took turns playing caller and call taker. I guess it made for an easy thirteen bucks an hour. But mentally, this became an unbearable test for our patience.\n\nAfter a month or so, these dress rehearsals finally led to opening night. On Friday, we'd be taking calls for the very first time. Live calls. I was excited but nervous. Hell, all of us were.\n\nLike soldiers prepping for war, me and the other four trainees arrived at eight A.M. sharp. Our classroom was lower than the police station's first floor. A literal \"basement.\" A dimly-lit hallway took us past clunker vending machines and straight to this bunker of a 911 Center. Nothing but cold air all around us.\n\nOur instructor Ms. Wilder had already given us a tour during our first week. On one end of the Center was the 911 floor itself: a series of cubicles full of huge monitors and computer screens. An arena that veered between Wall Street histrionics and 9-to-5 monotony. There were no windows, no joy. The lighting appropriate for a clinical lab... as was the mood. When the calls were coming, the workers went into a pissy frenzy. And when the calls died, things looked agonizing. Boring. Within those bland gray walls, the call Center was the doldrums of the Columbus Police Department. \n\nTwo double doors separated this torturous telethon from the rest of the 911 Center. From our classroom.\n\nRight now, I counted about seven middle-aged and exhausted people working the lines. Two call takers, four dispatchers, and a really obnoxious female supervisor. She was an overweight slob of a woman. Then again, the vast majority of the employees here were overweight. We'd all been told it was an inevitable side effect of the job.\n\nBut my classmates and I still had to endure another month of training. Yeah, we'd be answering calls. \"Supervised calls.\" But hey, it beat having to do terrible role playing or memorize countless run codes.\n\nSo there we were in the cramped classroom. A claustrophobic space of old tables, cheap CPR dummies, and a whiteboard. There were no windows. No escape. The closed door kept us trapped in our own little world. Like stranded explorers around a campfire, us five trainees stayed close to the portable heater. Our only solace from the unrelenting cold.\n\nMs. Wilder and her assistant Kelly stood by the front desk. Right by the large laptop. Our 911 manual sat beside the laptop. The manual our \"script\" for the variety of upcoming emergencies we were about to face. Its withered pages older than stone tablets.\n\nI sat near my classmates. There was Tania, a pretty black girl in her early 20s. Her and I went to high school together and Tania was still just as charming, loud, and petite as she was then. Her flamboyant clothes only matched by her colorful claw-like fingernails. Then there was Abby, the only one of us who was married. A tall, plus-size blonde with glasses and sarcasm to spare. Her studying and immense knowledge at this job put us all to shame... even the instructors. \n\nAt 18, Catherine was the youngest out of us. She was a brunette with a thick Southern accent. I thought she played dumber than she really was... or at least, I thought she was just trying to be funny... And finally, there was Patrick, the only guy in the class. One of two guys in the entire 911 Center. Patrick was funny and cute... and pretty weird as well. Scrawny with green eyes, his morbid humor threw everyone off. Then again, he was also a horror writer and from what I understood, even posted on Reddit. Given the lack of men out here, I could tell the thirstier, middle-aged female call takers constantly kept their hungry eyes on him. He was also 27 and older than the rest of us. Hell, I think he even had a degree... so who the fuck knows how he ended up here.\n\nOur instructors were cool for the most part. The stickler was Ms. Wilder, an older black lady with glasses and hair strewn about all over the place. But she respected us and we respected her kind but authoritative style. Like a veteran sergeant, she'd experienced her fair share of war stories on those phone lines. And this was going back to when they didn't use computers...\n\nOn the other hand, Kelly was a little younger. More hip. A blonde Southern Belle with a pleasant attitude and face. And yeah, we walked all over her like high school rebels on a sweet substitute teacher.\n\nBut right now, us five trainees were sitting in nervous anticipation. Awaiting our death sentence of a first call. Under Ms. Wilder and Kelly's watchful eyes, this would be our first taste of the call taker life.\n\nClinging to my headset, I stole a look at my classmates's restless faces. For once, we weren't even shooting the shit at eight A.M. Not with the battlefield looming before us.\n\nMs. Wilder checked the laptop one more time. She hit the touchpad and stepped back. The laptop's screen and lights beamed to life.\n\n\"Alrighty,\" she said in a strong tone. Ms. Wilder confronted the class. Playing her right-hand man, Kelly tried to emulate Ms. Wilder's strict gaze.\n\n\"Who's first?\" Ms. Wilder challenged us.\n\nStaying quiet, we avoided eye contact with this firing squad. And our fate.\n\nSilent tension dominated the room. Ms. Wilder's wicked smile vanished.\n\nBattling my anxiety, I thought about taking one for the team. After all, it's not like I could forever avoid confronting that call...\n\nBut right when I was about to step up, Ms. Wilder fixated her on Tania. \"You first, Tania,\" Ms. Wilder said in a staunch tone. Our instructor was back in drill sergeant mode...\n\nGroaning, Tania stood up and walked toward the laptop. Her and I exchanged weary smile.\n\n\"You got it, girl,\" I quipped.\n\n\"Man, I hope!\" Tania exclaimed.\n\nKelly guided Tania to the desk. Plugged in Tania's headset.\n\nWatching over them like a self-serious stupidvisor, Ms. Wilder motioned toward the manual. \"Just remember you can use that anytime.\"\n\nThe words didn't exactly encourage Tania. She flashed me an anguished look.\n\n\"We'll be right here,\" Ms. Wilder went on.\n\n\"Oh Lord...\" Tania said through the nerves.\n\nMy classmates and I couldn't help but chuckle. At least we weren't gonna be the *first* guinea pig. Poor Tania.\n\nLeaning in toward Tania, Kelly pointed at the screen. \"Okay, your call's coming in there. Click it and you'll follow the script.\n\n\"Okay,\" Tania said.\n\n\"We'll hear everything so don't be nervous.\"\n\nTania's trembling hands put on the headset. She smiled at me. \"Ooh, child!\"\n\n\"You got the volume up, right?\" Ms. Wilder asked Kelly.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Kelly replied as she backed away from the desk.\n\nCurious, Catherine looked toward Ms. Wilder. \"Is it busy today?\"\n\nMs. Wilder gave her a mischievous smile. \"Oh, it will be. Trust me.\"\n\nLike an Apocalyptic alarm, a ringing phone blared through the room. Straight from the laptop.\n\nThe sound jolted Tania into a frenzy. \"Oh Jesus!\" she shouted.\n\n\"Answer it!\" Ms. Wilder said.\n\nRecovering fast, Tania's focus overtook her goofy charm. She clicked on the call.\n\nStatic blared off the laptop's speakers. Like a lost signal on the radio, everything was white noise.\n\nUnease crossed Tania's face. \"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\"\n\nJust a sea of static greeted her. Wave after wave of mechanical screams.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Tania repeated.\n\nNothing. The steady static sliced through the air... I thought I could even hear faint footsteps through the noise. Even faint voices.\n\n\"Keep going,\" Ms. Wilder commanded Tania.\n\nTania kept her eyes on the screen. \"Columbus 911-\"\n\nA sudden click cut her off. A hollow dial tone blared like a heart monitor's flatline.\n\nDefeated, Tania just shook her head. \"Ooh, child...\"\n\n\"No, you did good!\" Ms. Wilder reassured her.\n\nThrough the fear, Tania snatched off the headset.\n\n\"Definitely,\" Kelly added.\n\nMs. Wilder faced the rest of us. \"Just remember, never hang up!\"\n\nTania cracked a nervous smile. \"Whoo, I was about to! That shit weirded me out!\"\n\nKeeping her scholarly seriousness, Ms. Wilder faced her. \"Well, those kind of calls happen all the time, so you better get used to them.\"\n\nPatrick was next. He wasn't eager to say the least. Even his wacky coolness morphed into anxiety once he put on that headset.\n\nI flashed him a reassuring smile. He just offered me his cute grin. And an awkward laugh.\n\nOverbearing as always, Ms. Wilder stayed right on him. \"Now just use the manual if you have to.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Patrick said.\n\nTania gave me a light punch on the arm. \"You ready?\" she teased.\n\n\"Not at all, girl!\" I replied.\n\n\"Man, you got this!\" She looked over at Patrick. \"You better answer that call, Patrick!\"\n\nPatrick smirked. \"I'll try.\"\n\nAnother ring interrupted us.\n\n\"Okay,\" Patrick said, trying to calm himself. \n\nBut those rings were painful shocks to us newbies. Even when we weren't the ones answering, the rest of us stayed nervous. After all, we'd grown close over the course of the training. A call taker commune.\n\nPatrick forced himself to answer. \"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" he asked with the memorized mechanical tone we'd all mastered for that opening question.\n\nAn even more turbulent static rang out. Patrick cringed at the sound. Hell, we all did.\n\nThe concert of hissing continued. Loud and disorienting.\n\nAggravated, Tania covered her ears. \"Damn, girl! What is that!\"\n\nBut to me, there was no doubt. This had to be the same caller. I could hear the same movement in the background. Those same low, muffled voices. The same fizzles and pops through those sonic shrieks.\n\n\"911 Columbus, what's the address of your emergency?\" Patrick said in a nervous stutter.\n\nMs. Wilder leaned in toward the laptop. \"Is that the same number?\"\n\n\"No-\"\n\nA dial tone overtook the mysterious call. The otherworldly sounds ceased. Just like that, it was over.\n\nConfused, we all watched Patrick slide off his headset.\n\nAbby forced a smile. \"Who was that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Patrick said.\n\nPlayful, Tania confronted Ms Wilder. \"What's going on, Ms. Wilder? That's two of them now!\"\n\n\"Is the connection working?\" Catherine asked.\n\nLike a politician fending off a barrage of questions, Ms. Wilder waved us off. \"Trust me, it's normal. You're gonna get weird calls like that.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Patrick joked.\n\n\"Oh yeah, she's right,\" Kelly added. Her unwavering support of Ms. Wilder still oh so extra.\n\nNot missing a beat, Ms. Wilder turned her attention to Patrick. \"But you didn't hang up. That's good. Remember to never-\"\n\n\"Never hang up,\" Tania playfully finished.\n\nMs. Wilder just gave her a weak smile. \"Right.\"\n\nI couldn't help but crack up. Even with the creepy static still stuck in my head. Still replaying through my mind.\n\n\"I'm just telling y'all what to expect,\" Ms. Wilder told us. \"You're gonna have to be professional when you get out on the floor.\"\n\nIn a frenetic burst, the locked door knob began rattling. As if the brass knob was pulsating to life. Quick, jarring turns.\n\nStartled, the whole class looked at it.\n\n\"We're training!\" Ms. Wilder shouted at the top of her lungs. Now she was in *serious* drill sergeant mode.\n\nThe rattling grew slower. Weaker.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but we're training!\" Ms. Wilder yelled.\n\nAnd the knob then faded to stillness. A slow death.\n\nEach of us stared at it. Besides a few forced laughs or smiles, we couldn't mask our unease.\n\nMs. Wilder's chuckles shattered the silence as she faced us. \"Well, now that's over with, it's your turn, Abby.\"\n\nThey wired Abby in. And then another call arrived.\n\nAlways the prized teacher's pet, Abby answered before the end of the first ring. Before Ms. Wilder could even jump in.\n\nAnd there was the same static. The same waves of scorched sound. A scrambled symphony.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Abby said into the mic.\n\nThe static persisted. Only now I could hear clear movement. We all could...\n\nLoud footsteps played over the white noise. Staggering footsteps. Falling furniture.\n\nConfused, Ms. Wilder leaned in closer toward the screen.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Abby repeated.\n\nMs. Wilder faced Kelly. \"That's the same number...\"\n\nKelly checked the screen. The fear made her eyes go wide. \"Oh my God, you're right!\"\n\n\"The one I did?\" Patrick asked.\n\nBehind a worried gaze, Ms. Wilder stared at the laptop. At the listed number. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice hindered by unease.\n\n\"That's the same one?\" Tania exclaimed.\n\nThe static's scratching grew unrelenting. Like a scratched record from Hell, the sounds overwhelmed our minds.\n\nTrapped in an awkward silence, Abby turned to Ms. Wilder for help. About the only thing she could do...\n\nA painful scream shot through the static! The voice a tortured singer on this messy electronica. The female scream was low but agonizing... And it soon gave way to desperate breaths.\n\nNone of my classmates said a word. There wasn't even a lame attempt at humor amidst this shared terror.\n\nThe woman's voice tried to break through the constant static. \"Help... me...\" she strained to say through the gasping breaths.\n\nMs. Wilder faced Abby. \"Talk to her,\" she said, unable to hide her trembling tone.\n\nIn the call, the woman's heavy footsteps were heard stumbling around. Her constant groans as painful as her scream...\n\nLike a deer in the headlights, Abby stared at the screen but couldn't utter a word. Paleness permeated her face. \n\n\"Help... me...\" the woman said.\n\nThe call ended before she could even finish. As if the woman's life support had been unplugged in one merciless pull.\n\nMs. Wilder didn't wait to break the silence. But her terrible acting couldn't hide how much these last few calls had even unsettled her. \n\n\"Okay, that was good, Abby,\" she said. Shuttling us through this lingering fear like cattle, she herded in the next trainee. \"Catherine, it's your turn.\"\n\nBattling both the goosebumps and the cold, I folded my arms. I decided to speak just to get my mind off those disturbing replays. To get the static out of my head. \"Ms. Wilder, what do we do in situations like that?\" I asked. \"Like when it's the same caller bugging us.\"\n\nMs. Wilder gave me a dismissive wave. \"Oh, it's just prank callers. We get a bunch of them.\"\n\nCatherine sat at the laptop.\n\nImmediately, another call came roaring in. After checking the number, Ms. Wilder flashed an excited smile. \"Alright, this one's different!\" she said.\n\nKelly let out a sigh of relief. \"Whoo, thank God.\"\n\n\"You and me both, girl,\" Tania said.\n\nCatherine took the call.\n\nBut the static dashed our safety. The same static. All the intense white noise lent us even more chills in this cold classroom.\n\nWorried, Catherine looked to our instructors. \"Ms. Wilder-\"\n\nMs. Wilder motioned toward the laptop. \"Just talk to them!\"\n\nA long, eerie cry erupted from the laptop. Too human to be a dying animal... too familiar as well. The woman had returned.\n\n\"Oh shit!\" Tania yelled.\n\nLike a terrified wax figure, Catherine stared at the computer, her eyes wide the fuck open. Her mouth too paralyzed to even scream.\n\nThe constant static and scrambling soundscape drifted around our atmosphere. Throughout the classroom.\n\nMs. Wilder took a nervous step back.\n\nAnd then the woman's voice came on the phone. \"Help... me...\" she said in a dying gasp. \"Help... me... please.\"\n\nThe static spiraled out of control. An avalanche of sound.\n\n\"Catherine, talk to her!\" Ms. Wilder shouted.\n\nShivering, Tania stood up. \"How's she calling from a different number!\" her scared voice shouted.\n\nBut we never got an answer. And Catherine never got the opening question out.\n\nA harsh bump erupted from the laptop. A vicious thud and the phone call ended well before the woman's screams could re-emerge. \n\nEach of us were left in horrified suspense.\n\nMy eyes stayed on the computer. My body a trembling mess. I felt helpless. Especially with the looming inevitably of who was going up there next...\n\nRattled, Tania pointed at the computer. \"Ms. Wilder, who's that woman!\"\n\nLike a victim in denial, Ms. Wilder avoided eye contact with us. \"She's just a prank caller, guys. I'm telling you.\"\n\nKelly gave her a weird look. Not even she was buying this shit...\n\nMs. Wilder helped Catherine stand up. \"Y'all better get used to them,\" Ms. Wilder muttered. \"That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nThe heater had no chance at healing my scars. Especially when adrenaline now joined the fear and cold. I kept staring at the laptop. Forced to face my fate.\n\nStuck in a catatonic state, Catherine stumbled back to her seat. The five of us now made a frightened formation.\n\n\"Your turn, Chrysta!\" Ms. Wilder yelled out.\n\nI sat there, hesitant. Unable to console myself before the call.\n\nMs. Wilder waved me over. \"Come on, it's your turn,\" she said. \"Ain't nobody gonna hurt you.\"\n\nWith the slow march of a child heading for the principal's office, I walked up to that front desk. I could feel everyone's eyes glued to my every step.\n\n\"You got this, girl,\" I heard Tania say.\n\n\"Hey, maybe they'll hang up,\" Patrick said as a reassuring joke.\n\nAt least they were trying to encourage me on this creepy Friday morning. But I couldn't smile. Not now. Not on my 911 Judgment Day.\n\nKelly and Ms. Wilder crowded around me as I sat in front of the laptop. I plugged in the headset. My shivering grip placed it over my ears. Now I really felt chained to the computer. To this forthcoming call.\n\nUpon facing the laptop, I felt more anxiety sink into me. So many programs were already up there. A dispatcher box, the phone line, various call taker tabs... all of which I'd seen in the books. But all of it so much scarier on screen.\n\nMs. Wilder pointed me to the phone line icon. \"Now when that rings, just click on it to answer it,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I replied.\n\nTrying to focus, I avoided my classmates. Even when they were just being supportive. Tania and Patrick my constant cheerleaders.\n\nThrough the burgeoning excitement, I had to wait. My skin sweating in the cold, I readjusted the headset's mic. But I didn't have to wait long.\n\nRING, RING, the laptop screamed. The telephone line icon shook with ferocity. The incoming call from 706-645-4545.\n\nI fought against the nerves. I had to power through for me. For Julian. In one swift click, I answered it.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" I said in a strong voice. Channeling my inner Ms. Wilder.\n\nLike a malfunctioning robocall, I heard the white noise grip me. The incessant static sang out.\n\nBut I didn't give up. Not with Ms. Wilder breathing down my neck. And with Julian depending on me back at home.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" I said again.\n\nThe static stayed steady. The unsettling noises the sound waves of the dead. Seemingly a distress signal from outer space... or beyond the grave.\n\n\"This can't be happening again,\" I heard Kelly say to Ms. Wilder.\n\n\"Hold on!\" Ms. Wilder told her.\n\nI kept my eyes on screen. Further drawn in once I heard the movements amongst the static. Clumsy movements.\n\n\"Help... me...\" the woman's voice crawled to me.\n\nEveryone went silent. The fear almost overpowered my own voice and strength. *Almost*.\n\n\"Ma'am, what's the address of your emergency?\" I asked. I could feel my hands clenching tight. A nervous tic well beyond my control...\n\nThe footsteps grew heavier in the static storm. As if the woman was mustering whatever strength she had left just for this one call.\n\n\"Help... me...\" she said.\n\nImmersed, I leaned in closer toward the laptop. \"Ma'am-\"\n\n\"Help me!\" the woman cried out in a painful howl.\n\nStartled, I fell back. I heard Tania shout in fright.\n\n\"Help us!\" the woman screamed into the stifling static. \"Help us, please!\"\n\nLike fellow asylum patients, a collection of tormented cries joined her. Female, male. Agonizing screams, weakened whispers. Pitiful sobbing. All of it poured through the line. All these people in obvious pain... all of them dying.\n\nI heard shelves collapse around the screams. More chaotic movement erupted. Their terrified panic well on display.\n\n\"Help us!\" an old lady yelled.\n\n\"Send somebody!\" a panicking man hurled at me.\n\nTheir voices all grew louder and louder. With the static an unsettling beat, their desperate chants formed a desperate final plea. My headset shook from their sheer force.\n\n\"Please help us...\" a young woman whimpered.\n\nThe victims's voices overlapped. Fused together for this frightening frenzy. Their room of death clamored for me. And I was too scared to say a fucking word... much less follow protocol.\n\n\"Please help ussss!\" the woman from earlier screamed, her voice now guttural and pouring from a wounded soul.\n\nFrightened, I pushed myself away from the keyboard. My headset tumbled off.\n\nMy hectic hands hit the touchpad, ending the call. I'd inadvertently sent us into a suffocating silence.\n\nBreathing heavy, I stood still and faced the screen.\n\nA red glow now decorated the phone line icon. The box's text read: *Call Ended 1:44*\n\nOne minute and forty-four seconds of pure terror.\n\nI noticed my scared classmates watching me. Our 911 training course now transformed into a horror house.\n\n\"What'd you do that for!\" Ms. Wilder shouted in dismay. Her voice a beaming defibrillator through our dead silence.\n\nStartled, I confronted her disapproving glare.\n\n\"I told you to never hang up!\" Ms. Wilder yelled.\n\nA calm Kelly stepped toward me. \"Yeah, you should've followed protocol, Chrysta.\"\n\n\"What is you talking about!\" Tania shouted.\n\nI looked over at Tania. Glad to have her on my side.\n\nBack in disciplinarian mode, Ms. Wilder confronted the class. \"Look, this is training! I've told y'all you're gonna get calls like this!\"\n\n\"So?\" Tania replied.\n\nMs. Wilder glowered at me. \"And you're not supposed to hang up, Chrysta! Ever!\"\n\nFor some reason, I looked back at Kelly. Knowing good and well whose side this bitch was on...\n\n\"She's right,\" Kelly said, a stoic calmness returning to her voice. For that matter, both her and Ms. Wilder were *way* too calm...\n\n\"Wait, so this was all bullshit?\" Tania asked.\n\nThe epiphany spread amongst us. I was caught somewhere between relieved and mad as Hell.\n\n\"Holy shit...\" Patrick muttered.\n\nMs. Wilder cracked a wicked smile.\n\nAnd if she wasn't my instructor or thirty years my senior, I would've punched the shit out of her right then and there...\n\n\"Hey, we gotta train y'all for the crazies,\" Ms. Wilder went on. \"And everyone passed except you Chrysta.\"\n\nControlling my temper for Julian, all I did was glare. A death glare for Ms. Wilder *and* Kelly.\n\n\"That's so stupid though!\" Tania yelled.\n\n\"Yeah, who was making those calls?\" Abby asked.\n\nKelly stepped toward the trainees. \"We got some of the call takers to do it.\" She motioned toward the door. \"They always help us with this part.\"\n\n\"Wow...\" was all I could say. I may have been able to stop myself from throwing punches, but I couldn't hide my voice's simmering anger.\n\nChuckling, Ms. Wilder patted me on the back. \"Hey, it's alright. We'll re-do it later.\" She walked toward the door.\n\n\"Re-take it?\" I said in disgust.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Ms. Wilder said. She unlocked the door.\n\nPlaying deputy, Kelly looked over at me. \"She's serious now.\"\n\nMs. Wilder swung the door open.\n\nLecturing me like a high school administrator, Kelly pointed at my face. \"Now I think you'll be fine, but next time, don't hang up on that call! Alright.\"\n\nI heard Ms. Wilder stumble back. In loud, panicking steps.\n\nThen Tania let out one dramatic scream.\n\nThe entire class looked toward the open doorway.\n\nAn ocean of blood flooded all the way down the hall. Right up outside our classroom door. \n\nI could see the vivid redness stick to the floor. Like gruesome paint, blood covered the walls. Even smeared over our classroom door.\n\nAnd there lying in the crimson sea was the 911 Center supervisor. Her sloppy clothes now coated in both blood and deep, crude slices. Long stab wounds carved through her black hair. Her weight reduced in a most gory attempt at bariatric surgery.\n\nFrightened but compelled, I rushed up to the supervisor.\n\n\"Oh God!\" I said.\n\nThe supervisor's hand still gripped her cell phone. And her last dialed number taunted me: *911 Training*. She'd been the one calling us all along. During this crazed caller training gone wrong...\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw the doorknob had smeared red fingerprints. This lady had no chance at getting in. Not when the door was locked. And not when we were training under Ms. Wilder's watch.\n\nI felt a wave of classmates whisk past me. Felt Tania snatch my wrist to drag me away. Drag me through this blood red museum sprawling before us...\n\n\"Who the Hell did this!\" Kelly cried through her tears.\n\n\"I don't know!\" Ms. Wilder yelled at her. \"We gotta get Sgt. Fonda!\"\n\nRather than following the others to the elevators, Tania led me through the 911 Center. Patrick even followed us to the call taker room. Their morbid curiosity apparently just as strong as mine.\n\nLike rain puddles, our feet splashed into the overflowing crimson. The rip-roaring rhythm so hypnotic... and disturbing.\n\nUpon entering the room, we came to a terrified stop.\n\nEveryone was dead. Slaughtered. Sliced beyond recognition. Bodies scattered about like mutilated livestock. Severed limbs in every corner. Severed heads still wearing their headsets. This call taker office a fusion between war zone and operating room.\n\nEverything was covered in blood save for the computer screens. And they all showed the last numbers dialed: *911 Training*. Unable to call 911, these employees had instead called the next best thing: us.\n\nAnd on that final, fateful call, I hadn't followed protocol. Instead, I'd hung up on a massacre in progress. And now we had a Code 7120. So many 7120s...\n\n[14](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/rhonnie14\/)"},"228":{"title":"A little horror\/love story I made a little while ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/m5ycc1","flair":null,"author":"jackknifejonni","selftext":""},"241":{"title":"The second part to the horror comic I\u2019m writing and illustrating!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/ltkbl9","flair":null,"author":"adamcurrie7734","selftext":""},"245":{"title":"What are the scary things any child has said to you?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1b6m5d2\/what_are_the_scary_things_any_child_has_said_to\/","flair":null,"author":"Responsible_Box_1057","selftext":""},"247":{"title":"My home is being haunted.

So I am always trying to dodge paying tax and the tax man is my devil. I am sure that I am a devil to other people, mainly the poor folk as I take so much from them. I don't want to pay tax and I have found a way round it. \n\nI find an extremely old person who has no connection to any of their relatives, due to family troubles. I then go up to them and I make them feel good. Then I set up a trust fund which is owned by them, I then put billions of pounds in there. Then a contract is drawn which says when the old individual dies, I will get the whole trust fund. Here in the UK there are trust funds which are protected from tax. The old individual has no idea what I am doing but when they die, I inherit my billions without paying tax or sometimes really low tax. \n\nI think it's genius and I have been doing it for many years now. I find a lonely old dying person, and I make a trust fund in their name and I then put billions of pounds in it, where also I am the soul hier to it. It's amazing. I have saved myself so much from paying tax and I really love myself for it. I really do think I am amazing at figuring this out all on my own and no body has sussed it out yet. \n\nThen there is 1 old person who made a trust fund in their name, and I put billions of pounds in the trust fund and where I am the soul hier to it. The lovely old woman signed it and everything. The one problem though is that she hasn't died yet. I then asked one of the workers about when she is supposedly to die. I them get told that she has been alive for 400 years and she doesn't seem to die at all. Her immortality is proving to be a problem for me. I need her to die so that I could inherit the billions that I put into the trust fund in her name. \n\nThen I put something in her food to kill her bit she is still alive? Maybe this one is a loss. I've still got other old people dying and me inheriting my billions without having to pay tax. We all make a loss sometimes.

She is a corgi and is about 4 years old. Everyday I take her for a walk and it is always a positive thing for both of us, it exercises her and makes me feel happy. So a win win.\n\nHer ears perked up when I said that and she tilted her head. \u201cRuff!\u201d That bark was deafening and I could tell that she really wants to go for one.\n\n\u201cAlright Pibbs, we will go.\u201d I grab her leash and head out the door. The walks are usually the same old, smelling around and going potty everywhere. But this time\u2026was different. She  didn\u2019t go pee or poop at all which was odd to me since she had been holding it in all day because I was gone at school and my brother and mom were out working. \n\n\u201cAlright, I guess you don\u2019t have to go potty then.\u201d I say to her. As we are walking I notice something strange happen with Pibbs. She started to whine and growl like someone or should I say something, was watching us. Obviously freaked out by this I start to pick up my pace and start to pull her a little harder to move faster and get the hell out of what was after us.\n\nBut when I pulled, Pibbles stayed. Still growling and still whining like a hurt hyena. \u201cNever seen her do that before.\u201d I said to myself in a shaky tone. \n\nA few seconds later, maybe 30 she stopped growling and whining and started smiling like her normal happy self does when she goes on walks. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d I mutter out. \n\n\u201cNOTHING\u201d it\u2019s a whisper of what sounds like a girl in the bushes right next to me on the sidewalk we are walking on. \u201cAh hell no.\u201d I yell out in fear and start sprinting away while Pibbles does too. I guess she noticed my fear too. \n\n\u201cITS OK, IM NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND FOREVER.\u201d The same whispering voice says. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d I say in a panic. \u201cWho are you and what the hell do you want from me.\u201d \u201cAlso how the fuck did you catch up to me so fast without me noticing?\u201d\n\n\u201cHehehe.\u201d This time the whisper turns real loud. \u201cHahaha.\u201d The laughing was creepy and almost sounded like she was laughing but also crying at the same time. \u201cWhat the fuck is so funny!?\u201d\n\nThe same laughing over and over again occurred and I couldn\u2019t take it any longer so I just sprinted again to get the hell out of there. Who the hell was that? Was that a ghost? How did they catch up to me so fast? What do they want? All these questions rushed into my head as I started to hyperventilate with fear.\n\nI am 18 and an adult male and still was to the point of almost crying from fear. The female disembodied voice vanished and was gone now, or so I hoped. \n\nMe and Pibbles cut off into this neighbourhood that we always go to for the daily walks we go on and it\u2019s basically a u-turn to get back home. We are walking and nothing else happens.\n\nWell, until\u2026\n\nUntil, I see a cardboard sign laying in the middle of the road. Going up to it in a slow and fearful manner, I pick it up.\n\n\u201cGo on and have fun on your walk. Be my guest, and go hide that lock. But don\u2019t be mad when you are eaten, by a hawk.\u201d The sign read.\n\n\u201cThe fuck is this shit.\u201d I said giggling. Probably some corny teenagers messing around and trying to scare an old lady or something.\n\n\u201cClick. Click. Click. Click.\u201d \n\nIt was low but still audible to hear. It was coming from underneath this bridge. \u201cPibbles it\u2019s ok.\u201d \n\nWe walk over there to the noise and it stops. Another sign is seen lying on the ground. \n\n\u201cI told you that you should hide the lock.\u201d The sign reads. \u201cWhat is this twisted bullshit.\u201d I say in anger and annoyance. I was thinking about heading back home but I was to close to solving this weird mystery that I couldn\u2019t leave, not matter how hard I wanted to and knew I had to.\n\nI hear the same clicking noise again. \u201cClick. Click. Click.\u201d \u201cWhoever is here, fucking show yourself.\u201d \n \nThis is when Pibbles started to growl and whine like crazy, like she was on the verge of death.\n\n\u201cLOOK UP BY THE BRIDGE.\u201d The same whispering girls voice from early says. This time right into my ear.\n\nI try to hold back the urge not to look, but I just had to. I look up and what I saw was, was\u2026horrifying.\n\n2 dogs, an old lady, a man, and a little girl. All of them, hanging and dangling down from the bridge. It wasn\u2019t a noose though that they were being hanged by, it was a leash, a fucking dog leash.\n\n\u201cCome on Pibbles. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here! NOW!!\u201d I scream with a fearful tone but also a crying and cracking voice. \n\nI ran all the way back home with Pibbles without stopping the whole way. No more whispering voices were heard the way back and no more twisted signs were lying in the middle of the road. \n\nWhen I got home though, I noticed something peaking out from underneath the doormat at the entrance of my house. A pink slip that was no bigger than a post it note.\n\n\u201cI told you about the lock, now you will be eaten by the hawk.\u201d Is what was written on the slip and this time, all in blood.\n\nI went inside and slammed the door shut locking all the doors and shutting all my blinds. Pibbles stopped with the growling and whining and sat on my bed in my room. My mom rushed in my room in a panic and said, \u201cthat was way too long and you worried me to death.\u201d \u201cWhat happened.\u201d\n\nI told everything that happened and everything I saw and she said to immediately call the police. I did that and told the operator everything as well. \n\nThe next morning the cops knocked at my door and said that no one was caught but the bodies hanged under the bridge have been taken and were confirmed to be that of a family. A grandma, her son, the son\u2019s daughter, and their two pet dogs. \n\nThe mom died a while back from hanging herself by sui**de. So the grandma moved in with her son as well as the granddaughter, and they brought their two dogs as comfort from her tragic death.\n\nI have the theory that what happened was some sort of twisted and evil ritual. But I have no idea.\n\nI mean who was that lady? Whose voice was whispering? What does the hawk have to do with anything? Why torment people who are going on walks and enjoying their day? All these questions that have no answers. \n\nSo to this day, I will never take any dog, I mean any dog, for a walk again.

By the time I was in my early 20's I was pretty Satanic and was deep into forms of new age beliefs and occult practices. During this period of my life, I experienced and witnessed some pretty powerful supernatural manifestations and spiritual experiences.\n\nIn 2015, I was betrayed by my best friend Josh, and his entire family.  In 2015 I had moved in with Joshuah's family , and within two months the living situation became untenable and deteriorated into a satanic and demonic circus, with crazy demonic manifestations and activity. At one point, I was drugged and taken to some satanic orgy, where I was raped by two Satanic witches. I remember vividly that this was the night that Connor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo in the first few seconds of the bout. I remember the fight being on the television in the living room.  I was given a cocktail that made me dissociate and I experienced stoppage of time with repeated white flashes like the  \"neuralyzer\" from the movie Men In Black.  \n\nI believe my ex best friends father was a very high ranking Freemason. Whats funny is that the man looked and talked like Christopher Walken, he enjoyed fine wine, and loved to cook. He was actually pretty hilarious at times, but you did not want to piss the man off.  I remember as a kid I broke one of his favorite wine glasses, and the man went bonkers smashing the kitchen to bits."},"335":{"title":"The time I visited an IHOP On my way to Vegas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/wg7kev\/the_time_i_visited_an_ihop_on_my_way_to_vegas\/","flair":null,"author":"javenonee","selftext":"One day, Me and my family were visiting Las Vegas for a Vacation, we were 3 hours in the car ride when we stopped at an IHOP for food and a bathroom break.

I could have done things differently but I love doing the same thing over and over again. \n\nRoutine is what I am made for and whenever I see that guy walking on the road, I hit him with my car at much higher speed.

Oil is an important element in worldly civilisation today and it is how everything is able to function. From cars to electricity pil plays a vital role.

We are not so advanced after all as we are still using something that was made from dinosaurs dying billions of years ago. The main news is that oil is running out. \n\nScience is trying its best to fund an alternative to oil. It is proving a difficult task though and how we all need it, it truly dumbs us down. A couple of weeks ago I was on the train and the doors were about to close. I saw a man running towards the train and this is a common sight. Only half the man's body makes it and the other other was stuck outside. So half the man's body was cut in half by the train doors. Instead of seeing blood, we saw oil instead. \n\nHalf of the man's body was hopping inside the train and he was confused as to why he had oil for blood. Looking outside his other half of the body was also confused as to why he had oil for blood. Some people on the train were secretly collecting some of the oil spilled on the floor in bottles. They wanted to sell it. Then as the train made it to the train stop, some guys in suits too the half hopping man away. Oil was being spilled on the floor still. \n\nAs more days went by I saw more people trying to make it onto the train just before it closes, unfortunately only half of their bodies made it onto the train. The other half was stuck outside. They all had oil fot blood and someone in a smart suit took them away. We started hearing of people sneezing out oil from their noses and bleeding out oil when they cut their fingers. They were never seen again. News started going round of the American government of turning people's bloods into oil by putting something into the air. They were doing this so that they could be free from relying on the middle east for oil. \n\nThen I was nearly late for the train and as the cut me in half, luckily I still had proper red blood.

If you don't know what raw dogging a flight is, it's basically when you are on a long flight and you don't watch or listen to any on flight entertainment. It's the ultimate dopamine detox and it's become really popular. I have made it a hobby to raw raw dog as many long haul flights as I can. I went on another long haul flight which was supposed to be a 5 hour flight, but it has turned into a million hour flight. I remember listening and watching no entertainment on the flight, and then I started getting restless. \n\nWhen I looked at the timer on my phone, it says that I have been on this plane for a million hours now. It sounds impossible but it's what the timer says. I think I definitely need some dopamine. Now when I say that I have raw dogging flights, it's not just a fast from on flight entertainment, but it's also a fast from killing. I needed to kill someone straight away. Now because I had been on this plane for a million hours, I needed to kill more than 1 person. When I killed the first 3 people in a very silent sleek way, I noticed that it was affecting my eyes. \n\nMy eyes were going blurry and this happened to me before I got onto this flight. I killed a few loners at the airport and it really started to blur my vision. I never knew that killing affected your vision? My eyes were going blurry now and I hid some of the dead bodies on empty seats, and it looked like they were sleeping. This flight is so long and I had never been on a million hour flight before. \n\nThen when I checked the internet and I checked whether there was such a thing as a million hour flight? I became horrified when it said that there is no such thing as a million hour flight. I mean there's no need for it, especially where I was going. It was was really off and my eyes were becoming really blurry at this point. I wish someone had told me that killing people would damage your eyes. Then again nobody knows that I murder people and if they did then I will be locked up. \n\nThen I realised that killing isn't bad for your eye sight. I then realised that my eyes weren't blurry, but rather that all of souls from the people I have killed are slowly appearing to me. They have kept this plane going for a million hours. They want revenge."},"368":{"title":"Darren was glad that his girlfriend was cheating on him ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1d8bk7m\/darren_was_glad_that_his_girlfriend_was_cheating\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"Darren was upset when he found out that his girlfriend was cheating on him and he couldn't believe it. The way Darren found out was by his girlfriend sending photos and videos of herself cheating. Darren couldn't believe it and his girlfriend didn't come home after that point. Darren was on the phone constantly texting her and going through the pile of photos his girlfriend had sent him of herself cheating. It was such a random thing to do and they had been together for many years and for her to just cheat so openly was absolutely ruthless. His girlfriend also sent videos of her cheating on him. \n\nI guess she is an ex girlfriend now and she even started sending evidence of her cheating on Darren, to everyone they knew. So now it was going to be a social media storm of people giving their opinions. Darren was just glued to the phone and sifting through social media to see what people have been saying about it. Darren was still in disbelief and his phone was glued to his eyes, as he couldn't take his eyes off all of the photos of his ex girlfriend cheating. He would go through the motions. \n\nThe emotions Darren went through was from anger to emotional. He would just be staring at the photos of his ex girlfriend cheating. Then he would check out the people who she was cheating on him with. Then when his ex girlfriend finally called, Darren was shouting and then finally calmed. The only thing Darren's ex girlfriend said to him was \"at least your glued to the phone, stay glued to the phone\" and Darren was confused by that comment. \n\nThen Darren would go through the photos and videos of his ex girlfriend cheating on him. He would then go through past pictures of him and his girlfriend at restaurants and on dates. Then he wanted to move on and everyone else in his life had moved on, and it took him a while but he was getting better. \n\nWhen he wasn't as glued to the phone anymore, he couldn't believe his eyes. The world had been over run by creatures of other higher dimensions, but the rest of humanity are too distracted by thier phones to see it. Then he realised that his ex girlfriend had only cheated on him and made the cheating public to distract him from these creatures. \n\nThe other worldly creatures have now noticed Darren.

I am a poor man who has a wife and 2 children and many people tell me that I should never have had kids in the first place due to my financial situation. I ignored them and one day I prayed to God to not change my financial situation in any kind of positive way, and by some miracle, God did as I had told him and my financial situation is still bad. I couldn't believe that God had answered my prayers. All praise to Yahweh the great and almighty. \n\nThen when my youngest child was seriously sick I went down on my knees prayed to God and pleaded \"Please god do not make my son better and do absolutely nothing\" and by some miracle, my son was still sick. I couldn't believe that I had proven the existence of God once again and my outlook on life had so much purpose now and everything was shining brightly. My son's condition was not getting any better and God did nothing which is what I had prayed for. \n\nThen my second son went missing and I prayed to God to do nothing and for my son to be missing, and by some miracle my son was still missing and god did nothing. He did exactly as I had asked for and this proves his existence. I go round to hospitals where I visit terminally ill patients and I pray to God to do nothing for their sickness, and God does nothing. The terminally ill patients all rejoice in witnessing god answering my prayer. \n\nWhen my wife took her own life I prayed to God to do no miracle and there was no miracle, and I rejoiced once again when my prayer was answered again. I am proving god's existence so many times over.

But first some back ground. I am infamous around New York for being the best in the biz. I\u2019m no stranger to weird contracts, hell I\u2019ve been hired to kill the governors pet. So when I got a message at 1am offering me two hundred thousand dollars I took the deal. I traveled to buffalo on a plane and bought my guns there, noting since I was so good I never racked up a criminal record so I got it without problem. I was hired to wipe out a building with 17 people, approximately. Something that caught me off guard was that I had to use a pistol with a headless snake etched In it and bullets laced with cobra venom. But two hundred racks in the bank, makes you over look those details.  I had to take an hour to oblige these details so I was onto the building. It was seemingly in the middle of no where in a dead forest. So I proceeded kicked down the door and to kill two of them shooting the first one in the lungs, choked on his own blood and the second one I shot through his left eye and left a crater in the back of his head. I proceeded and killed five more by shooting them from cover when they were charging me, with stained white blades. This caught me off guard but I just shot them down and let the poisons Do it\u2019s work. After this I found the rest in one room. They did not move they just smiled. I naturally got confused and creeped the hell out so I just finished the job. This was in less than one minute, the whole job so I called the number of this guy who hired me to ask when I would get my money wired to me. What happened next made me jump. One of there phones rang. It was the leader he was alive. I let him hang up and that he typed some bit and than I got a notification. Two hundred thousand dollars was wired to my account. The leader was up by a wall slumped over and gave me the same smile and uttered with all his energy \u201cfor the lord and the headless snake.\u201d I was naturally curious after this so I looked around. No cops were coming this place was far from the closest town so I saw it as safe to do so. I looked around and found multiple headless snakes in rooms with headless snake paintings all over them. I looked at all there corpses and found a small tattoo on there back neck of the same headless snake. I realized with this I had been hired by no ordinary cult, if there is even such a thing. This was a suicide cult. I wanted to get out of there but I was still curious as to why they had me do this. So I stole some of there scriptures and snake bibles. I\u2019m not saying what it said in those books, but let\u2019s just say I\u2019m leaving the biz and going as far away from that building as possible. And if you ever see that insignia, run. It will drive you insane like me. Those books gave clarity, the most dangerous weapon ever. Don\u2019t look for me cuz you won\u2019t find me.

Ghost stories, urban legends, all that\u2014it was entertainment, nothing more. But after what happened last winter, I\u2019ve stopped laughing at things I can\u2019t explain.\n\nIt started when I rented a cabin in northern Michigan for some time alone. I needed a break from work, from people, from everything. The cabin was small, tucked into the woods, with no neighbors for miles. Perfect. Or so I thought.\n\nThe first few days were peaceful. Snow fell lightly, muffling the world outside. I spent my time reading, hiking, and enjoying the quiet. But by the third night, I began to notice\u2026strange things.\n\nIt started with the window. I was reading in the living room when I glanced up and saw condensation\u2014a handprint. A single, small handprint on the glass.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make sense. I hadn\u2019t touched that window, and I\u2019d been inside all day. The snow outside was untouched, no footprints leading to the cabin. I told myself it had been there when I arrived and I just hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\nThe next night, I heard the tapping.\n\nIt was faint at first, like the ticking of a clock, but irregular. I was lying in bed, and it seemed to come from the wall behind me. I turned over, holding my breath, straining to hear. The tapping stopped.\n\nI told myself it was the old wood settling in the cold. But deep down, I didn\u2019t believe it.\n\nOn the fifth day, I went for a hike, hoping fresh air would calm my nerves. The trail behind the cabin was beautiful, winding through dense pine trees. About an hour in, I found something strange: a small clearing with a single wooden chair. It was old, weathered, and faced directly toward the path I\u2019d come from, like someone had been sitting there, waiting.\n\nI felt uneasy but pressed on, thinking it was some hunter\u2019s spot. Still, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nThat night, the tapping returned. This time, it was louder, more deliberate. It moved from one wall to another, as though something\u2014or someone\u2014was circling the cabin.\n\nI turned on all the lights and checked every door and window. Everything was locked, the snow outside untouched. But when I returned to the bedroom, I froze.\n\nOn the window above my bed, there was another handprint. This one was larger, and the fingers were impossibly long, stretched almost halfway down the glass.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep that night.\n\nThe final night is what still haunts me. I was packing to leave early, desperate to get out. Around 3 a.m., the power went out.

Not tapping this time\u2014scratching.\n\nIt started at the front door, a slow, deliberate scrape, like nails dragging across wood. I froze, clutching a flashlight, listening as the sound moved to the window, then the wall.\n\nAnd then came the voice.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t loud, more like a whisper carried on the wind, but it was clear. \u201cLet me in.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond. I didn\u2019t move.\n\nThe voice came again, this time closer. \u201cLet me in. I\u2019m cold.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember falling asleep. The next thing I knew, it was morning. The power was back, and the snowstorm had stopped. I grabbed my bags, threw them in the car, and drove away without looking back.\n\nWhen I got home, I tried to rationalize everything. But a week later, I found something in my bag: a single, weathered piece of wood. It looked like it had broken off a chair.\n\nI don\u2019t hike anymore."},"388":{"title":"Who wins this fight if all 5 of these characters fight ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/1gt26ok","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":""},"389":{"title":"I think I bummed a demon ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1gb1sqe\/i_think_i_bummed_a_demon\/","flair":null,"author":"Queasy_Waltz_1785","selftext":"For context 4.2 days ago I saw a bbb (big booty baddie) 4 meters for my location I activated rizzler mode and bagged her name was clarie and we did some bedtime sparing and she got pregnant and gave Birth to my son she strangely wanted to name him hargomoth I said ok idgaf and then 3 days later he was already fully grown and got a gf and got her pregnant she wanted to name there newborn daughter Sophie and he wanted to name her magonaroth she agreed after he threatened to destroy the multiverse and then 6 hours later she was fully grown then went missing we found her summoning Satan but I stopped her with my massive muscular body then 4 hours ago I got a message form clarie saying: (I shall be back to this realm in one thousand years but since you gave me such pleasure I will give you a servant that looks just Like me and will do what ever you want) I may have doomed the universe but I got a girlfriend "},"390":{"title":"I have to pay child support to my dead child ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1g1t8d5\/i_have_to_pay_child_support_to_my_dead_child\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I have to keep paying child support even though my child is dead. It's an unusual situation I am in and I don't know how to feel about it. I loved my child, but at the same time paying for the child support and alimony was tough. It was a heavy burden and when I first heard that my child was dead, I was ashamed to feel some form of relief and I was sad that he was dead, but at the same time there was relief. How my son ended up dead was all because of my ex wife, my ex wife is a unique character.\n\nWe were arguing over money again and she started putting me down for not wanting to give money freely. So she said \"take it easier for you I'll just put our son down, so you can be free of this responsibility\" she said sarcastically and then I heard a gun shot. I went over to her house and found our son dead. I called the police and the body was taken and my wife was instantly arrested. My son was buried and now I am a free man who can do what he wants now. \n\nThen a year later I get a letter stating my child support payments are going to carry on now for my dead son. I was taken aback by this news and it had an address for where my dead son was now living. I went to that address and the house was seriously breaking down and was clearly not habitable. Then my dead son came out and he was rotting and decomposing, then an old lady came out with him. She was doing weird voodoo stuff around him. She was doing magic to make dead son look more alive. \n\nIt was clear that she unburied my dead son and brought him to life, because she knew that I was paying child support towards him. This is a scam and I tried telling the courts this but they didn't care at all. So now I am paying child support to my dead son and I did try to stop paying, but the witch sent my son and he turned demonic with sharp teeths and claws, and yes this did scare me back into paying child support. So I am paying child support to my dead child and there is nothing I can do about it. \n\nIt's funny how life turns out and I guess the old witch is my wife now. \n\n\n"},"391":{"title":"Join me and my other 3 split personalities on this podcast ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1fkjxbj\/join_me_and_my_other_3_split_personalities_on\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"Join me and my 3 split personalities as we host this podcast show.

Also you are the only one with a name and the 3 of us got. What if you are not the main personality. It really got us talking and I wanted to see whether I was main original personality born from birth. So then I found an opportunity. I found a reddit post about a wife complaining about her husband and it really made me think that it was my wife. \n\n3rd personality: you know being the branch personality from a main original personality isn't so bad. Sometimes to just exist is enough for me and being the main personality isn't a priority to me. \n\n1st original personality: you know I am definitely the first and true personality that was born from birth and you lot are branches, it's just facts. \n\n4th personality: it's the cockiness of it all really and that you think you are better than us, for being the main original personality. We get it and you don't need to keep going on about it. \n\n2nd personality: any how back to my story, the reddit post sounded like my wife was writing about me. It described me in horrible ways but I wasn't ashamed, but rather I found it exciting. So I did more stuff to my wife and I then read about it later on reddit. I was excited rather than ashamed. \n\nThen I accidentally unalived my wife and I then found my dead wife writing about it on reddit. \n\n1st original personality: what the hell\n\n3rd personality: man what on earth!\n\n4th personality: dude for real\n\n1st original personality: I rush home because we all have the same wife and she hasn't been seen today or even picking up her phone.

That sounds absurd because I live alone and if I am work, then how can deliveries come from my flat? \n\nIt's true and I remember the first I got a delivery order from my own flat. I had to deliver it and I was calm. I knocked on my flat and some weed smoking hippy opened the door and took the pizza and gave me a great tip. My flat looked different inside and had a load of hippies inside. I then drove back to the pizza delivery place and I got another pizza delivery from my flat again. I was knocked out of the park by these deliveries all coming from my flat. I delivered another pizza again to my flat on the same day, this time an obese lonely man opened the door. \n\nThe flat looked completely different and it smelled horrible. The hygiene of the place was  putrid and I gave the pizza to the obese guy and he tipped me as well. All night long I was delivering pizzas to my own flat. Then when I went home to my flat, it was completely empty and it was back to being my flat. It was incredible what I had just experienced and I had no idea who those people were. At least I got paid and tipped all at the same time and I didn't have to deliver far, as all of my deliveries were to my flat. \n\nEver since working at the pizza place 2 years ago I have just been delivering to my own flat. I see all sorts of people opening the door and my flat inside looks completely different. I have delivered pizza to my flat where murderers had opened the door and there was blood all over the walls. I have even delivered pizzas to my flat and non human figures had opened the door from inside the flat. \n\nThen I come home and it is exactly the same as I had prepared it. Then one day I get another pizza order to my flat like usual, when I get to the front door of the flat, the person who opens it, is myself.

This wind caused the boat to occasionally rock back and forth. Crashing into the waves caused the freezing water of the Pacific Ocean to splash all on me. Soaking me wet.\n\n\u201cUgh, isn\u2019t Mother Nature sometimes a bitch.\u201d I exclaimed in annoyance out loud to myself. \n\nA bit of background information to help things be more understandable. I have been fishing for over 10 years now and only do it as a hobby to make some money on the side. \n\nIt\u2019s not a full time job that I do as I work for a business and create my own art work to sell as the main career, but as a little side gig, make a little bit of money; and hey, fishing in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere surrounded by visibly limitless ocean, is a way to face a fear of deep bodies of water that I have, also known as Thalassophobia.\n\nI only do the fishing about twice a week, normally on the weekends because for some reason it is a relaxing experience to be by myself in solitude with nature itself for a couple hours. Only being out about 10-20 miles from shore, I make sure to stay about 3-4 hours out and make sure to come back before sunset. Living close as well to the beach is what inspired me to begin having this hobby of fishing. \n\nA couple times I have hallucinated some things after being in the intense heat one summer day. The waves started turning into beautiful hilly green meadows, and I tried to get off my boat to walk on them, but then I stopped myself after noticing that they were hallucinations.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the scariest middle of the ocean story that I have. Yeah, hallucinating about a beautiful, calming, and serene meadow trying to cause you to drown is not the scariest thing I have experienced. The scariest thing\u2026. is what happened yesterday.\n\nIt was the typical fishing day. Waiting around in boredom waiting for the fishing line to start and move and pull you downward by getting heavier. Until, I noticed something in the distance. It was a little green thing. Sailing closer to it, I get close enough to point out what it is. It was a bottle. \n\n\u201cThe classic message in a bottle.\u201d I said to myself chuckling. \u201cMust be something cool.\u201d \n\nReaching out from my boat, I grab it and pull it back into my boat. Opening it\u2026 pop goes the cork.\n\nBut I noticed something after doing do. \n\nThere was no message in it. Instead there was only a liquid. A red liquid. \n\n\u201cProbably a drunk that forgot to tie up there wine.\u201d I said to myself rolling my eyes. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t wine. \n\nIT WAS BLOOD. \n\nI knew this because of the smell of it that I did to see if it was genuinely wine or not. And it wasn\u2019t, it was blood. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d \u201cAgain though I am in the middle of the ocean, and it is pretty odd out here in general\u2026 so, I shouldn\u2019t get too worked up about this. I should just get one more big catch and call it a day and sail back to the coast to go home.\u201d\n\nI knew my wife missed me. My sweet, beautiful, wife. The girl of my dreams. I love her so much and I sometimes feel bad when I leave her at home to go on these fishing trips. She always is worried when I go because of the risk and danger of the ocean taking my under and drowning me. \n\nGrabbing my net to get one more catch, I throw it in the cold, deep, blue water, and begin to wait for fish to get in. \n\n*Shake, shake. Shake shake* the net went and it was at this moment that I knew it was time for a big catch. \n\nReeling the net up I see lots and lots of fishies.\n\n\u201cJACKPOT!\u201d I yell out in excitement. \n\nBut than\u2026\n\n*Crash* \n\nWaves crashing hard into my boat. Causing me to rock like crazy. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201d I say in fear but also pride after what I had just caught. \u201cThis will probably hands down be my biggest catch I have ever gotten!\u201d\n\n*but this isn\u2019t the scariest part that happened.*\n\nNo not the blood in the bottle and not the waves trying to feed me to the wrath of Mother Nature. \n\nIt was when I noticed another boat in the distance. A tiny boat, about the same size as mine. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd, usually when I am out here I am the only one. Must be another fisher. I could say hi to them maybe. But I really should get back before this wind and massive waves take me out any more. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just say hello and leave. Ok, fine! I will go over there.\u201d I said in my head after have a little battle of thoughts conflicting each other. \n\nThe waves were pushing me over to the other boat anyways and it wasn\u2019t like I was going against such an obstacle, so why not just meet this fellow sailor. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to do, I mean I have already been out here by myself for hours anyways. \n\nSailing over to the boat close enough to reach and get off onto it, I throw my sea anchor out and come to a complete stop with the only movement being the rocking from the waves. \n\nI get off my ship onto the other one like a pirate and calmly knock on the cabin door in a friendly and quiet manner, making sure to be polite and not startle the person who\u2019s inside. \n\n*knock, knock, knock*\n\nno answer \n\nAgain\u2026\n\n*knock, knock, knock*\n\nNo Answer \n\n\u201cHello, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt you, just wanted to say hi and wanted to know if you were another fisherman or not or maybe you could be lost, well if you are, than I will help you and am here to help you.\u201d\n\nThen the door opened after the next knock I did on it. \n\nCreaking slowly and creepily like something out of a horror movie. I take a peak inside and see it is absolutely empty. Nobody, no noise, the only thing being a bed, a kitchen, stove, bathroom, etc. \n\nBut I did notice one thing\u2026 a terrible stench. It smelled awful. I couldn\u2019t pin point what it was or where it was coming from. But it was terrible. \n\n\u201cWhere is this person? Is this another hallucination I am having?\u201d I said out loud, this time in genuine fear.\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard\u2026\n\n*buzz, buzz, buzz*\n\nAround my ears , going around them. \n\nThey were\u2026.\n\nFlies????\n\nI watched one in the air to see where it will land at and it went over to the bed. Walking over to the bed, I noticed a swarm of flies above it. Intrigued I pulled the mattress off the bed and found something awful. \n\nA dead corpse lying on the floor. A hole of blood coming out of a man\u2019s head, looking only in his 30s. A pistol lying right by his hand. \n\nBut next to him\u2026. \n\nOh next to him\u2026\u2026\n\nWas pure nightmare fuel.\n\nMY OWN WIFES HEAD SEVERED AND LYING ON A PLATE WITH A KNIFE STABBED IN HER Right eye!

Damn I thought i was good robbing stuff by now. I guess we all have our off days and I am running. I guess this counts as my exercise right? Any how as I am running  away, the two police officers chasing me start reporting me to other police officers through their walkie talkies. They start to describe my appearance and I was really shocked. They said that I looked to be in my 20s, tall and of strong muscular build. \n\nI couldn't believe it and i turned around and stopped running. They arrested me but I didn't get sent to jail, I had to do voluntary work and clean up areas. I looked in the mirror and I saw myself as the opposite of what the two police officers had described me. When my voluntary work was done, I couldn't trust mirrors anymore. What if what I was seeing in the mirrors was completely wrong. I needed honesty and police officers were the most honest and especially when they are confronted by crime. I wanted an honest answer. \n\nIn the mirror I saw an ugly decrepit individual who is basically a loser. So I robbed someone in front of some police officers. I started running again, and the police officer chasing me started talking on his walkie talkie to other police officers. He started describing me as a tall strong looking individual. I couldn't believe it. In reflective shop windows I saw myself as this scrawny ugly looking guy, but the police officer describing me was saying the opposite. I didn't know who to trust and I managed to get away from the police officer. \n\nIt could be maybe the mirrors were lying to me and purposely making me to look ugly. I started committing more crimes out in the open in front of police officers. The things they described about me, it was amazing. Most of the time I got caught because I just had to thank the police officers for how they described me. Then someone told me that the police officers were just lying about my appearance as a way to get me to stop running. It made sense but I couldn't buy it. Why would police officers lie? Then I decided to ruin my appearance through use of acid. \n\nThen when I shot someone in the face in front of officers, the way they described my appearance. They described me as a burn like appearance individual. They were telling the truth. Police officers are better than mirrors. Then when the guy I had killed  whose body became possessed by something, started biting people the police started chasing him. \n\nThey described him as a demonic looking fella.

Ding dong.\u201d Three disturbing rings. Unsettling pauses in-between each one, about 5 seconds each. This was the first time all of this creepy shit happened and at the time, was what I had prayed would be the one and only time. But, of course\u2026 of course\u2026 I was WRONG!\n\nLiving alone by myself at the age of 18 has always been creepy yet very nice at the same time. The pleasure of not having to worry so much in life and having the freedom to do whatever you really want at home has always been an ultimate bliss to me. On the other hand, it can get a bit freaky at night time, especially at night time. But me being a man, I had grown past that little fear, until the knocking began. \n\nThe weird thing however, was that I live in the middle of nowhere. Legitimately the middle of nowhere. The epitome of being in literally nowhere. So for someone to be ringing my doorbell at the middle of the night, is very rare and has never happened before, so it gave me the chills when it first happened.\n\nObviously my first instinct was to look out the window that is on the top of the door to see who it is and I did that. But\u2026 no one was there. Weirded out, I just dismissed it as a punk teenager or group of teenagers doing the good old classic ding-dong ditch prank. I also did this when I was younger so I understood the joke and left it as it was. I wasn\u2019t in any danger or anything, just some kids pulling harmless jokes to try and scare someone for their YouTube channel to get views on. And that was it for the rest of the night and I went to bed without hearing any more. \n\nBut when this happened, I was very weirded out and had a strange feeling in my stomach. Knowing it was probably just the ding-dong ditch stunt, I still had this unexplained sensation in my stomach. A feeling in which I felt fear but also anger, a feeling like I was gonna throw up. Like one million maggots had been eating away at my guts type of sensation. What if it wasn\u2019t just a joke, what if it was something else, something unknown,  something completely SINISTER!!!\n\nThe next morning it was the same old getting up, eating breakfast, and scrolling on my phone texting with my old friends. Completely forgetting about what happened the night before until it just hit me all of a sudden in my memory. I was thinking about it all day even after breakfast that morning. When I would take a shower, when I cleaned the house, when I was driving around town, even when I was on the toilet. It was just lingering in my mind somehow even though I knew it was nothing to worry about. I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I tried to get rid of the thought of it, but every time I did, it enhanced and worsened somehow.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell Jaron, it was just some silly kids pranking you last night. Nothing more than that. You are a grown man being scared of some punks.\u201d I said to myself in my head. \u201cGet over it and just go and take a walk for a little bit to clear your mind.\u201d \n\nListening to myself I follow my own commands and take a quick walk around where I live, complete solitude, peace, and nature as well as the feeling of someone watching me or better\u2026 SOMETHING\u2026 watching me.\n\nWhen this weird sensation and feeling that we all have kicked in, I told myself, \u201cnah, fuck that shit, hell no\u201d and I started to speed walk back to my house. When I was doing this however, the thought of the night before was very vivid and kicked in my head randomly. The noise of the doorbell going \u201cding dong\u201d and the feeling of that feeling in my stomach in which maggots were eating away at my insides, grew back and came back to my harmless, innocent, soul.\n\nQuickly rushing into the door of my house, I slam it shut, and deadlock the fuck out of that shit. This was a rare moment in which I have been very scared to the point in locking everything in my house up. The last time I did this was when I was sure I was being followed by this crazy homeless man that came out from the trees nearby. But it turned out that the poor man just wanted money and was just trying to get money from me. Feeling bad about this interaction but also listening to my guts, I went back out and gave the man 5 bucks. He said, \u201cbless your soul\u201d and smiled as he turned around and walked away. Knowing that he was just asking for money and wasn\u2019t trying to do anything harmful to me was when he walked past my house down the desolate street, looking for someone else to bargain from. \n\nFeeling silly about that whole thing really made me change a lot and that moment was 2 years ago. I moved out from living with my mom, when I was 16 because of some family issues. I sometimes miss that warm home but also at the same time don\u2019t, a feeling that is hard to explain really.\n\nAnyways, the second time I heard the knocking was during the night again after the night the first knocking was heard. I had just gotten ready to go to bed after pulling an all nighter playing video games. It was 2 AM, so very late at night, or technically the morning for all those dorks out there that wanna correct me, (don\u2019t take it seriously or be offended, I\u2019m just kidding and I love you). \n\nGetting my bed set up and turning off my light, I hear a faint pounding noise. \u201cthud\u2026 thud\u2026 thud\u2026 Thud\u2026 Thud\u2026 THUD!!!\u201d \nThe last one was extremely loud and startled me I gotta admit.\n\n5 knocks, the first 4 starting off quite than progressively turning loud. I noticed that this time instantly though that it wasn\u2019t any ringing from the doorbell, it was just plain old knocking.\n\nI just waited in my bed silently, acting like a coward with the blanket covering my face, hiding underneath it. In genuine fear, I heard my heart pounding and could feel it. \n\n\u201cTHUD THUD THUD THUD!!!\u201d This time the knocking but very very loud. Extremely loud.\n\nAgain\u2026 \u201cTHUD THUD THUD!\u201d\n\nThen: \u201cTHUD, THUD!\u201d\n\n \u201cTHUD!\u201d\n\n*And than complete silence*\n\n\u201cWhat the actual fucking shit was that!?\u201d I said to myself screaming in my own head. And then I went to bed without even knowing it, drifting off. \n\nThen I woke up suddenly. Looking at my phones time it showed 2:35 AM. \u201cI had only been asleep for 20+ minutes! Come on, what fucking now?\u201d I said in annoyance and rage. \n\n\u201cDing dong ding dong! Thud, thud thud! Hehehehehehhahahhaahhah. Buzz buzz buzzzz! Hahhahahahah! Hahahah! IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU JARON! Hahahahahahah!!! YOU LITTLE SHIT!!! Hahahaha! Time to get murdered! Heheheh! Ding dong ding dong ding dong!!! LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nI suddenly woke up again sweating.\n\n*it was only a horrible nightmare!*\n\nGetting out of my bed to get a glass or water to calm myself down from the nightmare, I walk out my room and head downstairs to the kitchen. But than\u2026 \n\n\u201cDing dong ding dong gggggggg ongggg ongggg!\u201d The last note was long and echoey sounding and it looped around in my head for a long time till it faded away into fucking nothingness!\n\n\u201cI AM GOING FUCKING CRAZY AREN\u2019T I?\u201d I whispered to myself. \n\n\u201cOfc you are, aren\u2019t we all?\u201d A voice muttered down the hall. It was coming behind the door. Gently stepping over to the voice to avoid creaking from the wooden floor panels even though whoever was outside heard me, I make my way over to it after grabbing a knife from the kitchen I was in before.\n\nI creep my head up to the window of the door and I first see nothing.\n\nThan\u2026\n\n*a white thing in the corner of my eye, in my peripherals vision.*\n\nFocusing more on it since it is dark I flip on the outdoor light and notice that it is a piece of a paper and it has\u2026 writing on it?!. It is a note?!

The trials a child must go through in life and all of the fears, anxiety and trepidation they must face is daunting. As a responsible parent I have been doing my best to show my daughter that ghosts don't exist and I have taken many steps to assure her that ghosts don't exist. I myself use to be scared of ghosts as a child but my father helped me through it and I will do the same with my daughter.\n\nIn our family there is a tradition that we do when one member is scared of ghosts and I called all of the extended family and neighborhood friends to come to my house. The main event was going to be about my daughter realising that ghosts don't exist and it will be nice for everyone to be together as it has been a long time.  My daughter was terrified and even more anxious as she was going to be the main attraction, but I told her that after the event she will no longer be scared of ghosts. \n\nThen when the day arrived and all of the guests gathered around the house with a man tied up to a chair, my daughter was in the middle. The man tied up to the chair was killed and as he died I told my daughter \"observe this man dying body is there any spirit coming out of him?\" And my daughter just stared at him with wide eyes. For hours we all just stared at a dead body as we were all witnessing no kind of spirit coming from the mans body. This was a lesson for my daughter and a reminder to everyone else in the room that ghosts or spirits don't exist. \n\nThen on another night my daughter got scared again and killed our cat.

Anyways when I turned 18 I started getting super closing shifts and what not which basically is like someone who closes out a grocery store ur last one out of the building.\n\nIt\u2019s an average job that anyone could do but anyways a coworker who I worked with told me a story about when she super closed once. She told me she cleared the women\u2019s restroom out and nobody but Mark the other super closer was on the floor and in the building. She had to stop and use the restroom she made sure no one was in there but after doing this she got done with her business and noticed the stall door next to her had a pair of feet. Not shoes but bare feet which is a little weird because nobody in their right mind goes into a public restroom with no shoes, she didn\u2019t say anything but kept her business to herself and then when she was about to leave the stall she now smells a horrible smell like death or something which absolutely doesn\u2019t smell like shit or anything she basically got out of that stall and then when she walked past the stall that had a pair of feet in them she sees through the crack of the door that a woman is staring back at her now she becomes paranoid and tells her that the building is closed and she must leave. The woman says nothing but is still staring at her like she was watching her. Next thing next the coworker is about to leave the restroom right before she hears the stall door open and the woman who was in that stall runs out and dead sprints right at her so the coworker GTFOs outside the restroom and when she gets out of that restroom she inevitably looks back and the woman didn\u2019t follow her out of the restroom and apparently she never saw her again before she was fired because she was late to work 1 too many times. \n\nOk I\u2019m a bit shaken up by her telling me this story but she definitely was one of the weed smokers but weed doesn\u2019t make you hallucinate like that. And she never would do mushrooms on a shift because she was still clocked in. So anyways my mind starts to race but other then that I closed it out and it was an uneventful night but my next shift I was on utility and while taking trash out of the theater I notice out of the corner of my eye a black shadowy mass that was watching me and I stare at it point blank and it was gone. I shooked it off as my eyes playing tricks on me maybe it was just the lights playing tricks on me but I couldn\u2019t explain the figure being at least 2 times my height and I\u2019m an average guy I\u2019m 5\u20199 and what ever I saw in that theater was definitely two times my height and even as I remembered it more it had a face to with no eyes. I definitely was now concerned about working there. \n\nA few months later me and my manager for that shift were cleaning out a row in a theater it was super busy that day and nobody could prank us because the other Ushers were already about to clean a XD theater me and her are finishing up the same row and next things next I hear this roar that no man could replicate it. It almost sounded animalistic but I heard and me and my manager lock eyes I give it a few seconds because maybe it was a guest playing tricks with us and they were gonna run away but I never heard footsteps and this time I turn to my manager Kendra and I ask? \u201cDid u hear that too\u201d she being a 5\u20193 20 year old woman turns to me and quivers out a \u201cyeah\u201d I tell her to call over the radio where the ushers are and the other manager says they are cleaning 11. And then we now just book it out of 19. Year passes and nothing like that until I hear a story from one of my fellow weed smokers who told me a few days ago about why I should never be in theater 11 alone like ever.\nShe was cleaning 11 and as she\u2019s about to exit the theater she hears a pair of footsteps running up and down the stairs and then next thing you know she investigates to see if anyone had came into the theater and now she\u2019s all alone she then goes to the top row and no one was hiding and so she shakes it off as her brain playing tricks on her and not even 5 minutes pass and one of the maintenance workers runs into the theater she was cleaning in he asks \u201cdid you see the emergency exit door propped open in 11\u201d she now knows that this was now supernatural. \nOn new years day 2023 a family of 4 were going to watch a movie when they had a argument on which movie to watch and the father runs to his car grabs a revolver and shoots himself right in front of his family.

And the usual sections on safety procedures and schedules were there, but then I hit the \u201cRules of Conduct\u201d section. That\u2019s where things got weird.\n\n1. Never look directly at the security cameras.\n2. If you hear footsteps behind you after midnight, keep walking. Don\u2019t turn around.\n4.

On my first night shift, I noticed something off. The cameras seemed to track me, almost like they were alive. Sometimes I could feel their cold, mechanical gaze on the back of my neck.\n\nThe second week, I heard footsteps echoing through the empty warehouse around 1 AM. I remembered the rule and didn\u2019t turn around. The footsteps stopped as soon as I reached the break room, but the sense of being watched didn\u2019t.\n\nThings escalated from there on. I started seeing shadows move in my peripheral vision. Once I caught a glimpse of a figure standing in the doorway of the storage area. I couldn\u2019t make out any details, but I knew it wasn\u2019t one of my coworkers. \n\nI tried to quit the next day, but Mr. Thompson insisted I stay, promising a raise. When I persisted, he looked at me with those cold, dead eyes and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave. You belong here.\u201d\n\nThe last straw was a few nights ago. I was doing inventory when I saw something that looked exactly like me, standing at the end of the aisle. It smiled with my face and started walking towards me. I ran, not stopping until I was outside, gasping for breath.\n\nLast night, I decided to investigate the warehouse further. I waited until everyone disappeared and crept back inside. I found a hidden staircase leading down to a basement I never knew existed. The air grew colder with each step, and the walls seemed to close in around me. At the bottom, a heavy metal door stood there and a faint sound of humming machinery coming from within.\n\nI pushed the door open and stepped inside. The room was filled with monitors, each showing different angles of the warehouse. In the center, a large, cylindrical tank bubbled with a thick, green liquid. Floating inside were distorted, half-formed versions of my coworkers. And at the far end of the room, sitting in front of a console, was Mr. Thompson, his eyes glowing the same cold blue as the cameras.\n\nHe turned to me and smiled, a chilling, predatory grin. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve found us,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be curious enough to join us.\u201d\n\nOut of shock I approached him and turned him around.

How news got around about the school not allowing toilets to be used was like wildfire and there was an uproar from the parents. It was so random how the school just banned toilet use. Even though there were signs signalling 'work being carried out' we weren't seeing any workers working on the supposed broken toilets. \n\nAnyhow one day as I was in a boring maths class, suddenly the whole of reality had changed. The school became one big bouncy castle and we were all bouncing around. The teachers shouted \"Who used the toilet to do a number 2!\" And it was then that we found out that whenever somebody took a crap in the toilets, it literally blessed the whole school and it would change the reality of the school. That was when we all found out why the toilets were banned. \n\nThen each student one by one had to do a number 2 in the toilets, in the hopes one student taking a dump in the toilets would bless the whole school to go back to normal. Each student taking a dump in the toilet and blessing the whole school kept changing the reality of the school to something whackier than the last. It was a failed attempt and it looked like the school was all lost. Then one student who is usually the silent one tends to be by himself. He took a crap in the toilets and his blessing of the whole school turned it back to normal. \n\nThe teachers were so grateful and everyone had to go back to their seats and never use the school toilets in any circumstances. They reminded us how we could go outside of school at any time to use toilets in other establishments like restaurants, gyms and anything else similar. \n\nThen the school walls started to eat people when they walked close to the walls. It was then clear that silent students' toilet dump wasn't a blessing but had turned the school into an entity. Everyone tried going outside and nobody tried taking a dump in the toilets to bless the school and change its reality, the school is done for.

I shouted out for help as to why I kept on peeing non stop. Hours went by and the ambulance arrived and were astonished as to how I still peeing for hours. Then the media got attention and doctors examined me while I was peeing. I was fine but I was still peeing and when a year went by, I was still peeing. I was all alone in this house now, peeing till the end of time. People lost interest and now and then I get a plumber to check the toilet is still working. \n\nFunnily enough I haven't felt hunger or thirst during this peeing situation. Also when I step back further from the toilet, my pee automatically stretches to still reach the toilet. Even when I sit down in the sofa in the living room to watch TV, my pee still reaches the toilet and dodges away from objects and walls. Sometimes as I'm standing above the toilet inside the bathroom, I start thinking about certain events in my life. \n\nI started thinking about my first marriage and how it only lasted a month. It was going well until I woke in the hospital bed as i had survived the head shot wound that I did to myself, but my wife didn't survive it and we both shot each other as a pact. Then I started thinking about the violent country I came from. I remember good people were being arrested for literally anything. Be it accidental littering or having to run across the road to reach something. \n\nAll the while murderers, thieves and other big time criminals got away with anything. When I got sent to jail for accidental littering, I was so sad. Then when I got to jail I was pleasantly surprised to find every good person in jail. It wasn't a jail but a haven from the world outside. I smiled to myself at that thought. \n\nIt's been ten years and I've been peeing in the same toilet. That noise it makes when the pee hits the water, has numbed my ears that sometimes I don't hear it anymore. The world has changed in ten years and there have been so many wars and financial crashes but I'm still here peeing. \n\nWhen burglars tried robbing my home I started running outside while my pee was still reaching the toilet and dodging objects. Then when I went back to my home, my pee was still in the process of strangling all of the burglars. \n\nThey were all dead and as the dropped the ground, my pee was still reaching the toilet.

The tribe is once again bigger than them and the Spartan population has gone down. They are few in numbers and even though they love fighting larger armies that are bigger than them, on this occasion they need to win as their whole civilisation is at stake. The leader of the Spartan army got word of an amazing warrior that could even the odds even if the Spartan army is less than 200. They don't even have any slaves to fight alongside them. When they first saw the great warrior, the Spartan leader laughed at him. \n\nThe Spartan leader also wanted to kill the two men who brought the disabled and decrepit man to them, who they said was an amazing warrior. The amazing warrior was disabled and even mentally slow, he would have been thrown over the cliffs if he was born as a Spartan baby. The two men offered their amazing disabled warrior to the Spartans all for free. The Spartans took the disabled man in as a joke, and just wanted to see him killed. Then the Spartans were going to fight the large tribe who attacked them first. \n\nWhen they were facing each other for the first time, the Spartans put the disabled man on the ground. Then the Spartans and the enemy tribe started seeing dead soldiers killed by yoyan in battle, and they were forming around them and they kept saying \"you lost your way yoyan you lost your way\" and yoyan was the disabled guy who was supposed to be a great warrior. Then the disabled yoyan started speaking and he started saying \"but I love losing my, because when I find my way back again, it's the most amazing feeling\" and yoyan started to transform into an bodily able strong soldier. \n\nThe Spartans and the enemy tribe were shocked to see the disabled yoyan, transform into a bodily able yoyan. Yoyan killed so many people that it was impossible, but everyone had witnessed it. Then after the battle yoyan went back to being disabled. The Spartans were cheering for the disabled yoyan and they were glad they were on their side. The two who manage yoyan, they now wanted a fee for the Spartans next battle and the Spartans paid. \n\nThe second battle between the Spartans and the enemy tribe, they all saw dead soldiers who were killed by yoyan in battle. The descaws saw their own dead soldiers chanting \"you lost your way yoyan you lost your way\" and as yoyan started transforming into a bodily asked strong soldier, he replied back \"but I love losing my way, because when I find my way back again it is the most amazing feeling, the best feeling. I love losing my way\" and yoyan did amazing in battle and won the Spartans another battle. \n\nThen the leader of the Spartans wanted the disabled yoyan to kill and stab every Spartan soldier. Someone placed a knife in yoyans hand and helped him stab every Spartan. Then on the last battle with the descaws, there was only a little boy who was pushing a trolley who had the disabled yoyan in it. Then dead soldiers that yoyan had killed in battle had appeared and they had all shouted \"you lost your way yoyan you lost your way\" and even the dead Spartans had appeared as well. \n\nAnd yoyan replied \"but I love losing my way, because when I find my way back again it is the most amazing feeling\" and as yoyan became strong bodily abled again, he ran at the enemy tribe. Then all of the dead Spartans ran behind yoyan and had fought alongside him, and they were more than soldiers now.

I wanted to be invisible as I was planning to commit a few crimes and so becoming invisible was the best option. When I bought the machine and I had to put it together, I was surprised by how simple it was to put it together. Then when I first went into the machine and turned it on, I expected to become invisible but instead the machine made me incredibly obese. I was angry as I wanted to become invisible and not obese. When I went outside nobody really cared about me or even care enough to notice me. \n\nThen I went back into the machine again after a few days and I was no longer obese at this point. When I turned the machine back on, I expected to become invisible. Instead I found myself not being invisible but rather I had become extremely short, I was essentially short. I was angry and I went outside screaming and shouting. Nobody cared enough to notice me, I mean they could see me but they didn't care about. I was almost invisible you could sat but in the horrible nobody cares about you way. \n\nThen after a couple of days I was back to my normal self and I went into the machine. This time the machine made me disabled and I was furious again. I hated being disabled and nobody cared about me, I mean I could have been ran over and nobody will even care. I am invisible to them emotionally but not physically. It felt horrible and I phoned the company that sold me this invisibility machine. They told me that the machine was just finding its bearing and that it was just figuring out its bearing of what invisibility is. I had to patient. \n\nThen when I went into the machine again after regaining back my body again. The machine did something, to me and whenever someone looked at me they thought I was a bus driver, Amazon delivery guy or some other low paid worker. They didn't care about me or my well being as I was not seen as an important person. I mean being this kind of invisible made me extremely distraught and how can anyone live like this. To not be seen or heard even though you are not physically invisible. Anything could happen to me and no one would care. \n\nThen when I went back into the machine, the machine simply made me old. I was so horribly invisible in front of people as they did not care about me. I was just some old person at the end of my tether. I was on deaths door and I was so sick at the same time. Then when I went back to being my proper age, I went back into that machine. \n\nFinally! The machine had turned me physically and fully invisible. I can now walk into any shop, supermarket or bank and rob them. "}}
