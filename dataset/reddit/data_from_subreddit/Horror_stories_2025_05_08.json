[natebquill.com](http:\/\/natebquill.com)\n\nCarl woke up next to his wife just as he had since he was 19. He wasn’t surprised to see that his daughter, Ava, had climbed into bed just between them in the middle of the night. She had been having nightmares for a few days now. He used his phone’s flash to figure out what to wear to work that morning. He scrolled through Instagram for a few minutes while his coffee brewed. \n\n“I’m going to give a random homeless person ten thousand dollars today.” \n\nHe sighed and scrolled. Ava had gotten onto his phone again messing up his algorithm. He hadn’t even seen her awake in days. \n\nHe skipped his usual egg and toast, having gotten some bacon for his wife and daughter the day prior. He hadn’t realized how much it cost, and decided to skip breakfast for a few days to make up for the money spent. \n\nBlack coffee in hand, he made his way to the bus stop. \n\n\n\nClocking in, he put in his code. 28882. 6:58 am. He moved towards the warehouse and picked up a box of old textbooks to be digitized. As he sat down with a sigh, a voice whispered. \n\n“Please remember me”. \n\nThe hairs across his arms stood. It sounded as if the sound had come from a drum inside his head. \n\nHe checked just behind him, looking over his shoulder, standing in his cubicle to see where the sound had come from. There he found a new cubicle mate, blasting music through his headphones so loud it was audible to everyone else on the floor. \n\nThe sound must have come from his new neighbor’s music. He looked over and read his new neighbor’s name, “Karl Prescott”. Quite similar to my own, he thought to himself. \n\nHe carried on with his day, slowly copying an old math textbook from the 1600s. He read the name “Robert Recorde”, a mathematician born in 1510, only living for a short 58 years thereafter. He had invented the basis of mathematics. \n\n\n\n‘The first equation written in modern notation, 14x + 15 = 71’\n\n“I can solve that!” He stared at it for a few moments, finally whispering “4” to himself. His new neighbor peeked over the cubicle. Perhaps the whisper wasn’t quite as quiet as he had thought. \n\n\n\nCarl Prescott’s shift had ended after dark on the warm summer night. After 5 hours of overtime, Robert Recorde’s “The Grounde Of Artes” will be reserved in online records for the rest of time. \n\nHe strolled to the bus stop pulling his coat around his neck. He felt a cold shiver come across him, all while the warm air and his warm coat made him sweat all over. \n\nStaring out the window Carl came across a crow covered in blood with a black cat’s lifeless body hanging from its beak. The cat was at least twice the size of the crow, but still the crow was able to hop effortlessly with the cat in its beak. From atop the bus stop under which the crow danced, stood an owl following Carl’s wide stare with eyes identical to his. 2 hazel eyes abnormally small for an owl, with a small black slit in the brown of his left eye.\n\nHe closed his eyes and held his breath for a moment. When he opened them he caught the animals just out of the corner of his eye, before slamming them shut again until it was past. \n\n\n\nGosh it was quiet. The house was dark again. He had asked his wife to keep the living room lights on when he was working overtime, but old habits die hard. He cleaned a few of the dishes, and left a bacon grease soaked pan to soak in soapy water until morning. \n\nHe sat down to play a video game for an hour before heading to sleep. He pulled up Hollow Knight, and waited for the game to launch. \n\n“Please Remember Me” covered the screen in plain white text, and flickered a few times. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath just as he had on the bus. \n\nThis ritual was cut short by 3 knocks at the door. Carl flinched and opened his eyes to the Hollow Knight start screen. He looked through the peephole but couldn't see anyone in the dark. He opened the door and looked out to find a trail of blood leading to his front steps. He looked down and found the crow, hopping around in a circle, the cat still at its beak. When the crow noticed Carl, he looked up and dropped the cat, nudging it towards him. A cold wind came through while the cat’s chest fell, and didn’t rise again. \n\nThe wind carried a whisper, “Please remember me”. \n\nCarl slammed the door shut at the sight of blood covering the floor. He began walking to his bed when there was another 3 knocks. \n\nBefore he could make it to the bottom of the stairs another cold wind came over him. Frozen in place, he could only watch.\n\n“Please remember me” he whispered over the household, before ascending to the next life. \n\n\n\nAva woke up in the middle of the night from yet another nightmare. She went downstairs to get a glass of milk and put it in the microwave, just as her dad had told her to do. “Warm milk helps you sleep, but if you’re still scared, come and sleep next to me”. \n\nShe tripped over something soft at the foot of the stairwell, before finding the lightswitch to put her toy away. \n\nWhen she saw the cold skin flaking off of her father’s corpse she screamed at the top of her lungs and ran up to her mom. \n\nIn a slightly confused daze, Emily ran down the stairs before stopping at the corpse. Ava clung to her mother’s side, her face slowly being covered in tears. Her mother whispered, almost too quietly to hear “I will. I always will”. "},"8":{"title":"The Zombie Radio Frecuency: Part 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kfv8oh\/the_zombie_radio_frecuency_part_2\/","flair":null,"author":"Traditional-Market85","selftext":"Lucas ran down the hallway as if the floor were about to collapse beneath his feet.  \nHe rounded the corner and slammed into a metal cabinet. The blow stunned him for a moment, but he didn’t stop. He knew that if he stood still, *something* would catch him. The worst part was that he didn’t know what that something was.\n\nMartínez didn’t move like a person. And he didn’t seem insane. It was as if his muscles were being pulled by invisible strings.\n\nAs he ran, the radio’s hum didn’t fade. On the contrary—it was everywhere. It vibrated in the glass panes. It trembled in the walls. Even his body seemed to resonate with it. A low pulse, like a distant drum getting closer.\n\nLucas reached the security room. He shut the door and turned the bolt. Stumbling to the console, he tried to contact someone through the general radio.\n\n—\"This is Base San Ciro... There’s an incident! I need reinforcements now!\"\n\nOnly static.\n\nThe hum changed again.\n\nNow it was deeper. Almost like a guttural, robotic chant—barely audible, yet it made his teeth ache. Lucas covered his ears, but it was useless. The frequency was everywhere. *Inside* him.\n\n—\"Shut up, shut up, shut up!\" he screamed, slamming his fists against the console.\n\nThen Camera 2’s screen flickered.\n\nIt came back on.\n\nLucas stared.\n\nMartínez was standing in front of the security door. Still. Motionless. Staring directly into the camera lens.\n\nBut he wasn’t alone.\n\nBehind him, in the blurry edges of the screen, more figures could be seen. People who shouldn’t be there. Three... no, five. One wore a maintenance uniform. Another, a grease-stained coverall. All standing. All still.\n\nAll vibrating to the rhythm of the hum.\n\nLucas collapsed into the chair, hyperventilating. Logic no longer applied. None of this made sense. He checked each monitor one by one. They all showed the same thing: figures that didn’t move… until they *did*. In unison. Without emotion. Like pieces of a macabre symphony.\n\nAnd suddenly, a voice.\n\nNot from the radio—but inside his head.\n\n*\"Tune in with us...\"*\n\nLucas screamed, clutching his temples tightly. He fell to the ground. The hum intensified, as if every atom of the air began to vibrate with it.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he didn’t know how much time had passed.\n\nThe screen was black.\n\nThe radio, off.\n\nSilence was absolute.\n\nAnd then, without warning, someone slammed on the door. Once. Twice.\n\nThen, in a dry, distorted voice that could not belong to anything alive, he heard from the other side:\n\n—\"Lucas... open the door.\"\n\nThe knock was so sharp and precise that Lucas thought the hinges would give way. Then another. And another. Each impact more violent, as if whatever was on the other side had forgotten how to use hands and now just threw its entire body against the door.\n\n—\"Lucas... open the door...\" the voice repeated, distorted, like dragged through a rusted cable.\n\nLucas crawled to the farthest corner of the room, trembling, his fingernails digging into the floor as if that could anchor him to reality. Sweat poured down his forehead, mixed with tears he hadn’t even realized he was shedding.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nOne of the hinges gave way. A piece of metal flew off and embedded itself in the wall like a dagger.\n\nThen came the stench.\n\nRot.\n\nNot the smell of someone recently dead, but of bodies fermenting from the inside. Flesh reheated from the bones by some unnatural energy—a combustion that didn’t create fire, only active decay.\n\nThe door burst open.\n\nAnd he saw him.\n\nMartínez no longer had a face.\n\nThe skin of his skull had slid off like melted wax. One eye dangled loosely, still faintly pulsing, held by a stretched and grimy nerve. His mouth hung open, but his tongue writhed like a severed worm. Black blood bubbled from his nose and ears.\n\nBeside him, another worker—one of the station’s technicians—stumbled in with his torso split open. His intestines, blackened and dry, hung like disconnected cables. He walked on a broken ankle, the bone protruding outward with each step.\n\nAnd both of them moved to the rhythm of the hum.\n\nLucas screamed. Not like a man—but like a cornered animal.\n\nHe ran for the back hallway, bumping into furniture, slipping on his own vomit. Behind him, the uneven, wet footsteps echoed like a grotesque march.\n\nHe reached the maintenance workshop.\n\nHe grabbed a tool at random—a rusted crowbar. He didn’t think. He didn’t reason. When one of the bodies reached him and tried to grab him with fingers that felt like wire, he struck its head with all his strength.\n\n*CRUNCH!*\n\nThe skull split like an overripe melon.\n\nA thick jet of blood, black as tar, sprayed out, coating his face and chest. The body dropped to its knees but didn’t stop. It kept reaching for him—jawless now—with a sharp gurgle that was anything but human.\n\nLucas screamed again and hit it.\n\nOnce. Twice. Three more times.\n\nUntil only a pulverized skull and a mess of unrecognizable flesh remained. But the radio on his belt was still humming. Even though he hadn’t turned it on.\n\nThe hum. And then a familiar voice.\n\n—\"You’re waking up, Lucas.\"\n\nHis hand trembled. His clothes were soaked. He didn’t know if it was someone else’s blood or his own. He didn’t know if he was still alive.\n\nOr if he still had a choice."},"9":{"title":"The Clockmakers Regret","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kft55f\/the_clockmakers_regret\/","flair":null,"author":"Different-Pride-1245","selftext":"The clockmaker lived alone, in a cottage filled with ticking hearts. Dozens of clocks lined the walls, from ornate grandfather clocks to tiny pocket watches, each singing its own rhythm of time’s passing. But none of them mattered now.\n\nHe had once loved time. He had measured it, respected it, worshiped it like a god he could almost touch. After fifty years of crafting and mending, his hands grown calloused and mind sharpened like a pendulum’s swing, he did the impossible—he built a device that could breach time’s veil.\n\nIt looked so simple. A brass dial, a humming coil, a switch that glowed faintly blue. He had called it The Gentle Hour. The first time he used it, he wept. He stood in his boyhood home and watched his mother sing. He blinked, and he was in the war, young again, terrified. Another blink, and he saw the moment he first opened his shop.\n\nBut something went wrong.\n\nHe can’t remember the moment of the explosion—only the deafening ring, the smell of scorched copper, and a flash of white. He had torn time, but instead of moving through it, he had become trapped within a single hour. Forever 3:17 p.m., October 11th. Leaves always falling. The same wind always brushing past his window. The same knock on the door he never answers, because he knows who it is—himself.\n\nEvery day, he watches his past self reach for the device. Every day, he tries to stop it, screaming, breaking clocks, smashing glass—but the loop resets before anything changes. The world returns. The tick begins again.\n\nHe does not age. He does not sleep. Time wraps around him like a noose that never tightens. He has torn pages from books, carved symbols into walls, tried fire, drowning, silence. Nothing sticks. He wakes up every cycle in the same chair, with the same cup of cold tea beside him.\n\nAnd worst of all—he remembers. Perfectly. Every second. Every repetition. He is a man trapped in amber, fully conscious, fully aware, endlessly circling the moment he ruined everything.\n\nOnce, he thought he could fix it. He rewired the machine a thousand times, adjusted gears, changed settings, replaced crystals. But the loop only laughed. It played him like a melody on repeat.\n\nHe has seen madness. He has begged time itself. He has cursed gods, built shrines, torn them down. The clocks mock him now, all striking different hours—none of them real.\n\nSometimes, he wonders if this is penance. For tampering with what should never be touched. For daring to believe he could master time, when he was only ever its servant.\n\nNow he waits for something—he no longer knows what. A crack in the loop. A merciful error. An end.\n\nBut the hour hand never moves.\n\nAnd in the quiet cottage, among ticking ghosts, the clockmaker remains. A prisoner of his own design.

At first, I thought it was the old wall clock in the hallway. But even when I took the batteries out, the sound remained.\n\nTick.\n\nIt followed me from room to room. In the kitchen, under the clink of dishes. In the bathroom, beneath the hum of the fan. Even in bed, when the world should have been silent—it was there. Constant. Persistent.\n\nTick.\n\nI asked my neighbor if he heard it. He laughed and said I needed to relax. Maybe I did. I hadn’t slept much since Ellen left. The house felt too big without her.

We moved from place to place, house to house, so quickly that I didn't even have time to unpack. When we moved to Cornwall only then, the boxes became an issue.\n\n\n\nThis was the first time in months that I was able to unpack in a house. We had decided to stay there until my father found a job elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOnce we had arrived, I was drawn to a room at the centre of the house. This room was a large open space with only a wardrobe, which was the size of my bathroom, and a bed. The rest of the room was a barren waste. The boxes were placed in a pile in the centre of the room. Over the time that I spent in that house I sifted through box after box, it felt like hundreds, maybe thousands. The first day I arrived I looked in the first one ready to unpack and sleep. This box contained a pillow, blanket and a dirty rag. “What the hell?” I said, picking up and sniffing the rag. It had a strange red substance coating a corner of it and it smelled like death.  “Ew” I threw it on the ground and got into my bed. In the night I woke up and heard a rustling noise in the centre of the pile, I looked in and saw nothing. I didn't think anything of it and climbed back into bed, resting until morning.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I searched many more boxes for items to fill the empty space in my room. My parents helped me for some, but left after they heard my little sister, Anne crying loudly. She was crying for attention. These boxes all carried mundane things and only one contained anything of interest. A bone. A small and dry bone, my parents never noticed me grab it. I looked at it with a strange sense of fear. The bone was small yet big enough that it could be seen as a finger. I slid it into a drawer and didn't look at it again. Later that night I heard the rustling of boxes in the wardrobe so I decided to deal with it in the morning.\n\n\n\nOn the third day, Anne said she would help me search the boxes. I knew she was just searching for her stuff. Yet, I accepted the help reluctantly after my mother shot me a look of danger. After an hour of box after box after box I got bored of the endless purgatory of my room. As I left to see my parents my sister said she wanted to see inside the wardrobe. “Knock yourself out.” I Said shortly. After coming back from my break, Anne was nowhere to be seen. I had guessed she got bored and left too. The pile of boxes had not changed since I left it and I cursed at Anne under my breath. The wardrobe was closed and I heard no noises from it all that night.\n\n\n\nOn the fourth day, the number of boxes was dwindling so my mother came to help me. As we both emptied boxes and talked I saw another bone, this one larger, a skull of a young person. I thought it was a statue of some sort so I put it in the drawer with the other bone. She finished half of the boxes and told me that she would tackle the wardrobe next. She also told me to take a break because I had worked so hard. I gladly got out of that room and allowed my mother to go into the wardrobe. I decided to look and play with Anne but she seemed to have disappeared from her room, maybe she went out with my dad to his temporary job. He had to work away for a few weeks so I let myself relax in the living room. Once I got back to my room, my mother was gone. It was getting late so I decided to get some rest. I didn't know where she was but I didn't worry. That night I heard a voice coming from the wardrobe. It growled, ” we are famished, we need food, we need you.” I grabbed my phone, put the light on and opened the door. It hit my nose first, it was like rotting flesh and feces combined, the sight that it showed made me want to die. It was a pit, I couldn't see the bottom of it. The black mass seemed to entice me. I fell, and I kept falling. Suddenly I felt a thud, I had hit a bottom. All around me is an endless expanse of darkness. I can see shapes moving in the absence of light. They are whispering. I'm writing this on my phone now. If you're seeing this I'm most likely dead, please somehow tell my dad not to check the boxes.\n\n\n\nOr he might find my bones next.

My name is Daniel Moore, I'm calling about the ad you had posted online, is the position still open?\"\n\n\"Oh, pleasure to speak to you, Mr. Moore.

Is that alright with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, ask away.\"\n\n\"First, are you physically capable of performing all the listed duties and any extra duties you will be provided with?\"\n\nI paused for a moment, unsure if I should lie and not mention my injury. This job could be life-changing, so i decided to lie.\n\n\"Yes, I am more than capable.\"\n\n\"Good good. Tell me, are you scared of the dark?\"\n\nI was a little taken aback by Mr. Haslows' question.\n\n\"Scared of the \\*dark\\*...? N-no not really.\"\n\n\"Very good. Tell me, how do you handle high-stress situations?\"\n\n\"Well enough, I can manage pretty much anything you throw at me.\"\n\n\"Good. Mr. Moore, we think you'd be a great fit and want you to work with us. Your introduction starts tomorrow night at 7:30pm. Don't be late.\"\n\nBefore I could ask any questions, the line was disconnected. At the time, I didn't care all that much, I was just offered a decent amount of money and that was all I could think about.\n\nTomorrow night rolls around, and I approach the building as instructed. The office was surprisingly tall and slender, reaching 15 stories but only about 300ft wide. The outside was decorated in beautiful golden lights that covered the quartz pillars stretching near the top. The bottom level featured a lapiz blue walkway with small gardens on either side. As I approached the main entrance, I couldn't help but notice a light, almost \\*metallic\\* smell coming from just beyond the doors. I was greeted by a rather tall and slender man dressed in a brown suit with slacks and a small blue bowtie. He had slicked-back hair, a sunken expression that looked as though he hadn't slept in weeks. Piercing blue eyes that seemed to almost look \\*through you\\* rather than at you. He had unusually pale skin, as if all the blood had been drained from him. He cracked a smile that revealed a set of perfect pearly whites. For a second, I thought I had seen more canines than a person should have\n\nAt the time, I didn't notice it, but something seemed almost \\*off\\* about his appearance, eyes a little too blue and sunken. A smile that seemed to invite more than just my presence. A stature and height that didn't make any natural sense.\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you in person, Mr. Moore.\"\n\n\"You must be Mr. Haslow? Pleasure to meet you too.\"\n\nHis voice didn't sound as empty as it seemed over the phone, it felt almost \\*relaxing\\*, like all the tension that was built up had faded away.\n\n\"Thank you for arriving at the specified time, allow me to show you around the ground floor and bring you to your supply room.\"\n\nAs we stepped into the building, I felt a weird sensation cover my body. A sense of dread, all the hairs on my body stood up and my mind started sending me warning signs to leave this place immediately.\n\n\"Is something the matter, Mr. Moore?\"Mr. Haslow responded, as if he could sense my body's reaction.\n\nFor some reason, all the panic signs left my mind and body the moment he spoke.\n\n\"N-nothing, Sir.\"\n\nAs we continued through the ground floor, I was able to observe and take in all the unique architecture the building offered. The walls were covered in red fabric, something akin to Chinese interiors. There were small pillars across the walls, some were marble, others were made from jade, and others from quartz, similar to the outside. On each pillar stood a bronze statue depicting some mythological entity. I recognized some of themself. Medusa, the Hydra, Cerberus, and even a statue of the Buddha. I didn't bother asking about the design choice.\n\n\"Here is your janitorial closet, in it you will find all of your cleaning supplies, and a list of your duties. I expect excellence from you, Mr. Moore. Do not disappoint me. Also, if anything strange happens, don't be afraid to give me a call. I've seen it all, I'll walk you through it.\"\n\nWith that, Mr, Haslow left and It was just me and my supplies. I was nearly done changing into my uniform when a crumpled-up paper fell from my pocket and onto the floor. I picked it up, confused as to what I was looking at.\n\nThis is what the note says:\n\n\\*I don't know how much longer I can work this job, the rules keep getting longer and more difficult to maintain. If you're reading this, you poor fool, follow these rules to a T and try to survive the night\\*\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor **immediately**. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAtleast once per night you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and continue with your duties. Failure to complete this rule will begin a countdown from 3 seconds. This isn't a chance to escape. It's a head start.\n\n**Rule 4**:\n\nThere is no one else on your floor. If you hear or see something out of the corner of your eye, ignore it. If it becomes aware that you know, then leave the floor and do not return for the remainder of your shift.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost *beast-like* screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly. It has no intention of allowing you to escape and will feast on you if it catches you. This is the Hunt.\n\n**Rule 6**:\n\nYou may hear the sound of someone weeping from just beyond your line of sight. You are alone on the floor. Ignore it and continue your duties on that floor. As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably . **DO NOT APPROACH**. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor. \\*Breaking this rule will initiate a hunt\\*.\n\n**Rule 7**:\n\nWhen cleaning a room, ensure all lights are on until you exit. If a room has 1 light off, leave the room and place the provided tag on the door. If all lights are off, run to the exit and do not look back. Pray it doesn't catch you.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter.\n\n**Rule 9**:\n\nNo two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*:\n\nIf your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nThe Anomaly can override other rules during the Hunt\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nDuring Hunt, only Rule 1 remains valid\n\n\\*These are all the rules I was able to discover. Please try your best to survive, and good luck.\\*\n\n\"Is this some sick joke? A means of pranking the new guy?\"\n\nI stuffed the note back into my pocket and left the closet with my supplies. I made my way up to the 2nd floor to begin cleaning. Something seemed \\*off\\* about floor 2, I started to feel incredibly sleepy even though It was only 7:58pm.\n\n\"What the h-hell... I only just started, my does it feel like I'm about to pass out.\"\n\nThat feeling of dread washed over me again, all my senses were on high alert as if my brain was telling me that something was coming. Creaking in the dark, just outside of view, similar to the monster you were afraid was under your bed as a kid. Or that irrational fear of the dark you had. Or that feeling of \\*something\\* watching you even though you know you're alone. Its in the room, crawling just around the corner as the rules had said.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*\n\n\\*If your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\\*\n\nAlmost instinctively, I dove through the nearest door and took cover under a desk. Almost immediately, the beast came crashing through the same door, slamming into the nearby wall and causing the lights to flicker on and off. The Anomaly moved with a nightmarish gait, loping on all fours with front limbs that bent forward at grotesque, inhuman angles — like shattered bones re-healed wrong, twice. Each movement was jagged, yet precise, its talons curling into the floor with a metallic scrape that echoed like nails on glass. Those claws weren’t just sharp — they looked capable of cleaving through bone as if it were damp paper.\n\nIts hind legs were longer, spider-like, joints reversed and too tall, giving it the jerky sway of something not meant for this world — like a predator stitched together from the wrong parts. The skin hung off its frame in slack folds, mottled and gray, as though it wore a costume made of rotting meat it hadn’t earned.\n\nIt had no eyes. Just twin pits where the sockets should’ve been, black and oozing, as if they had been scooped out or never formed to begin with. Yet it *looked*. Its head tilted and twitched toward the slightest noise or shift in air, sniffing — loud, wet inhales that rattled like lungs full of fluid.\n\nIts mouth never fully closed. Jaws sagged open just enough to reveal rows of needle-thin teeth, too many to count, some cracked and yellowed, others glistening with fresh saliva. It dragged those jaws past desk after desk, the rancid heat of its breath trailing behind like a smog of rot.\n\nIt wasn't searching. It was *honing in*.\n\nAs it approached my hiding spot, I began sweating, I nearly broke out into tears as this monster from hell drew closer and closer. It was inches from my face when it turned away and fled. I felt a sense of relief wash over me as I got up, nearly pissing my pants because of the ordeal.\n\n\"What the hell was that...\" Was all I could manage as it reread the rules with shaking hands.\n\n\"Ok, these rules are real, and I really don't want to die here. I'll just survive and quit in the morning right?\" I said to myself frantically, now realizing the danger I was in.\n\n\"Surely an office won't be my tomb.\" Was all I could say to myself jokingly.\n\nI stepped out onto the floor and performed my duties as I went from floor to floor, rereading all the rules before entering a new room. My heart sank as I stepped onto floor 5 and realized it looked a little too similar to floor 2.\n\n\"Wait, haven't I already done this floor...?\"\n\n\"Hey, sweetie...aren't you gonna look at me?\"\n\nThat sweet, familiar voice...Michelle. We dated back in High School with plans of getting married, but a massive fallout crushed those dreams.\n\n\"M-Michelle, what are you doing here?\"\n\nI started to turn around before remembering Rule 9: \\*No two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\\*\n\nI paused for a second, contemplating what to do next. Do I walk towards the door, or do I turn to face her? It must seem like an obvious choice to the reader, but this room did more than what the rules said. For some reason, my conscious thought was slipping further and further, it was as if the floor put a spell on you that made you forget the danger you were in. I almost turned around before the alarms going off in my brain clicked. I noticed that every hair stood up, and my body tensed; I was unconsciously afraid, even though I was unaware.\n\n\"N-no, you aren't real. Michelle left a long time ago, she isn't coming back.\" Was all I could manage to say without vomiting from the fear.\n\n\"Oh don't say that, sweetie, you knew I would always come back to you.\" the Anomaly responded, it sounded forced and guttural, like a poorly done imitation of what I remember Michelle sounding like.\n\nI turned towards the door and did my best to ignore the breathing that only got louder as I got closer to the exit. Its breath was like a heatwave, the strong stench of rotten flesh filled the air around me, forcing me to hold back tears and vomit as I inched closer and closer towards the door.\n\n\"You can't escape me, Mr. Moore, I will pick the skin off your flesh and take my time tearing you apart piece by piece. I will drain you of your blood as I feast on each of your teeth, one by one, as I relish in the ecstasy of your screams. You will know true pain.\"\n\nI could only describe the voice as something akin to a thousand cries for death, the chills that went down my spine caused me to whimper even through my labored breaths.\n\n\"I will tear you limb from limb, severing each nerve as I cut into your soft flesh. You will be strung up like a puppet as I enjoy every last morsel of your being. Don't think these \\*rules\\* can save you from me.\"\n\nI made it through the door, seconds from passing out from holding my breath and nearly choking on vomit. I collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air and finally throwing up onto the stairwell. Sweat ran down every crevice of my body as I struggled to stand back up.\n\n\"Th-that was close, \\*way\\* too close.\" I struggled to push out as I calmed down and searched for the list of rules I kept in my pocket.\n\nI froze in horror as I patted myself down over and over again, searching for the rules. The blood drained from my face as I realized I had lost the list.\n\n\\*\"Wait, how did it know about the rules?\"\\* I thought to myself as it slowly dawned on me\n\n\"No, no, no no no \\*\\*NO\\*\\*!\" I let out as I finally made the realization.\n\nThe Anomaly had taken the list of rules from my pocket while I was fighting to breathe. There was nothing I could do but hope and pray that I didn't need them for the remainder of my shift. I found my supplies at the door of the real 5th floor.\n\nFloors 5 through 9 remained the same. I remembered rule ten: \\*f your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\\* and was glad I could finally ignore it.\n\n\"Only 6 more floors to go. Then I can finally leave and never come back again.\" i said to myself as i prepped to enter floor 10.\n\nThe first thing I noticed after stepping onto floor 10 was a dark puddle that seemed to ooze out of a door. I approached it and reached down to examine it closely, I'm not sure why put it felt almost mesmerizing and \\*called\\* to me, like if the puddle \\*wanted\\* me to stick my hand in it. I reached out my hand to touch the puddle before my trance was broken by the sound of weeping. I looked ahead, trying to see what was making that sound, it came from the darkness just ahead. Light didn't seem to hit it. In my brief state of clarity, I realized that 2 different rules were happening at once.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAt least once per night, you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and leave the floor.\n\n**Rule 6**:\n\nYou may hear the sound of someone weeping from just beyond your line of sight. You are alone on the floor. Ignore it and continue your duties on that floor. As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor.\n\n\\*\"3\"\\* a foreign voice said\n\n\"Crap!\" Was all I could say as I stood up and bolted for the door.\n\n\\*\"2\"\\*\n\nI had almost reached the door when the sound of talons scrapping metal echoed throughout the floor. I paused.\n\n\\*\"1\"\\* the very last sound before the Anomaly came crashing through the door\n\n\"I told you Mr. Moore. Remember what I promised.\"\n\nThe Anomaly dashed towards me on those same, twisted legs. I made it through the exit with seconds to spare and was able to lock it before the Anomaly came crashing into it.\n\n\"Mmm...well played Mr. Moore. You aren't safe from me yet, I will catch you eventually.\"\n\nThe Anomaly seemed to almost \\*chuckle\\* when he said those words.\n\nI caught my breath and started heading towards floor 11 when I found a familiar piece of paper. It was the rules I had lost before, I don't know they got here but I am glad that I found them when I did.\n\n\"Oh thank God! I thought I was going to have to rely on memory forever.\" I said gleefully.\n\nWith a newfound confidence, I made my way through floors 11 through 13 without any problems. I continued to study and memorize the rules before reaching floor 14. As I stepped onto the floor, something caught my eye. There was an oddly placed wooden door at the end of the hall. I made sure pull out the rule sheet to confirm my mental note.\n\n\\*All doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\\*\n\n\"Yup, just as I thought. Surely there's no harm in approaching the door, maybe even taking a look around.\"\n\nTaking a look around, I was able to admire the interior of this building. Floor 14 was decorated with baby blue walls and shiny metal doors that screamed \"children's hospital\". The walls had pictures on them, some on doors, and others on the walls themselves. Some read\n\n\"Happy birthday!\"\n\nOthers read\n\n\"Sorry for your loss.\"\n\nI made it to the second-to-last door before the wooden one. That was weird, there was a smaller piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the door. I bent down to pick it up, and this is what it says:\n\n\"Pay attention to the running Mr. Moore.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold as I finally heard it, there was a frantic shuffling coming from the stairwell, it was accompanied by a wailing screech that sounded like a wounded animal. I finally snapped back to my senses and reread the rule sheet:\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost *beast-like* screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly. It has no intention of allowing you to escape and will feast on you if it catches you.\n\nI gathered my thoughts and raced for the exit, it sounded like the Anomaly was on floor 7, halfway here. I struggled to run with my damaged legs and started panicking as I practically waddled to the stairwell.\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*Mr. Moore\\*\\*\\*\" I could hear the Anomaly, it was on floor 12, 2 floors away.\n\nI made it to the stairwell and could see the sign:\n\n\\*\\*Floor 15\\*\\*\n\nI started climbing the stairs, moving as fast as I could and praying that I would make it. Sweat ran through my whole body as I begged to some higher power that I could make it before I was too late.\n\n\"I can smell you Daniel. The stench of your fear is like a drug, I can't get enough of it!\"\n\nThe Anomaly was on floor 14, it was here. I was only a few steps away when I heard it. The sound of metal on metal was painful to say the least, I felt as though my eardrums were about to burst when I finally made it to Floor 15 and through open the door. I turned around to see the Anomaly enter the stairwell with me and fly up the stairs as I fell through the door. I thought I was about to crap my pants while waiting in anticipation for the Anomaly to come crashing through. However, that moment never came.\n\n\"Oh, thank God.\" Was all I could say, wiping the tears from my face and trying to collect my thoughts.\n\nThis was the final floor before I was finally free. I got up and prepared to clear the floor before I heard a sound that made me begin to cry again.\n\n\\*tap, tap, tap\\* there was a rhythmic tapping coming from the door at the other end of the hall.\n\nI couldn't see the door but could hear the wood reverberating across the entire hall. As the sounds hit me, I felt a \"red-alert\" hit my brain and decided to check the rules real quick. I noticed a rule that had never been in play until now:\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 have either occurred or are occurring. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter. This initiates a Hunt.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nIf the Hunt is currently active, all rules except rules 1 and 12 are valid.\n\n\"Wait... I'm save! Rule 6 already happened on floor 10, and rule 8 is happening right now.\"\n\nThinking I was in the clear, I sprinted toward the staircase without hesitation—until one burning question flooded my mind:\n\n*How the hell am I gonna clear 15 floors in 20 seconds?*\n\nI thought I was safe, I still had 1 hurdle remaining, though. I didn't waste a precious seconding clearing floors while coming up with an idea that would let me make it out of here in one piece, I had to jump once the Anomaly made it to the stairwell.\n\n\\*3, 2, 1\\*\n\nI could hear the same howling that once made me terrified. The Anomaly came through, and was coming to take my life.\n\n\"You've sealed your fate, Mr. Moore.\" It didn’t bother with theatrics this time. Its voice was calm. That made it worse.\n\nI looked up from the 9th floor and could see him staring down at me. The Anomaly seemed to move almost methodically, not an ounce of urgency, just its talons tearing into the concrete walls like they were papier mache. At the time, didn't care about the Anomalys odd movements, I was in the home stretch and had every intention of jumping from floor 9 down to floor 1 knowing fully well it would break my legs but that I would be safe.\n\n\\*\"I've got one shot at this.\"\\* I said to myself as I lined up over the edge.\n\nI looked up the Anomaly one last time, with a new confidence that was immediately shattered.\n\nThe Anomaly’s face was changing. Warping. Becoming something else.\n\nIt was still vaguely human, but wrong in every possible way. Hundreds of pus-filled spores bloomed across its eyes, each one weeping milky fluid. Its teeth—if you could call them that—were rotting stumps spilling blood like a faucet. And its nose... it wasn’t gone. It was replaced. A gaping hole, black and endless, like it led straight into hell.\n\nI froze.\n\nAnd that’s when it smiled.\n\n\"Something wrong, Mr. Moore?\"\n\nIt spoke with a belly laugh, each exhalation forcing blood to pour out in all directions.\n\nThe lights were being stained with a seemingly endless pool of blood that made me jump. Not out of confidence in survival. But out of fear of something worse than death.\n\n\\*\\*\\*BOOM\\*\\*\\*\n\nI could feel my legs shatter as I hit the ground. Bone fragments had pierced my skin because of force, nearly turning my legs into pancakes. I was unable to move as blood started pooling in my mouth. In front of me lay 7 of my teeth and a giant pool of blood from my now leaking nose. I don't know if it was out of fear or adrenaline, but I started dragging myself across the same red carpets I saw when I came in. My closet. My haven. It was only 10 feet away.\n\n\\*\"So close, and yet so far...\"\\* I thought to myself as I used the rest of my strength to avoid losing consciousness, the concussion was going to sting when I fully recovered.\n\nFor now, all I could think to do was crawl, crawl and pray that I could make the grand escape.\n\n\"So you survived Mr. Moore. Impressive. Maybe you \\*are\\* worth chasing after all.\" the Anomaly said in a taunting voice.\n\nIt was still on the 15th floor but started moving, \\*fast\\*. It was only floor 10 when I was only 4 steps away from the door.\n\n\\*Floor 7\\*\n\n\\*3ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 5\\*\n\n\\*2ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 3\\*\n\n\\*1ft\\*\n\n\\*Floor 1\\*\n\n\"Mr. Moore.\" The Anomaly said, it had returned to its sinister and fear driven tone.\n\n\"I will rip out your insides and use them as a straw. Your skin will be my towel. Your teeth will be my cereal. You have any ideas on how I should use your bones after I've ripped them out of you?\"\n\nThe Anomaly came barreling towards the door and \\*almost\\* made it. I was able to close the door just in time. I had made it. Safe. Alive. Badly injured but still good enough to make it home.\n\n\"Im safe you monster! You can't touch me.\" I proclaimed this triumphantly, unaware of how much danger I was \\*really\\* in.\n\n\"Oh, sweetie...remember what I promised you?\" The Anomaly had taken on a twisted combination of his voice and Michelle's voice.\n\nI started panicking and pulled out the rule sheet again. Whatever blood I had left went ice cold as I read the rules one last time and started slowly crying to myself:\n\n**Rule 1**:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously. Returning to the room outside of the conditions mentioned will lock you in and invite the Anomaly to your door.\n\n**Rule 2**:\n\nAll doors require a keycard to be scanned. If you ever encounter a door that does not have a keycard, turn around and leave the floor **immediately**. If you break this rule, refer to rule 5.\n\n**Rule 3**:\n\nAtleast once per night you will find a puddle flowing with a dark and thick substance seeping from under a door. Do not touch this substance. Do not approach the door. Place down a Caution sign and continue with your duties. Failure to complete this rule will begin a countdown from 3 seconds. This isn't a chance to escape. It's a head start.\n\n**Rule 4**:\n\nThere is no one else on your floor. If you hear or see something out of the corner of your eye, ignore it. If it becomes aware that you know, then leave the floor and do not return for the remainder of your shift.\n\n**Rule 5**:\n\nOpening an unlocked door is seen as an invitation to the Anomaly and will immediately initiate the Hunt. Run to the stairwell and get to the highest floor. We hope you are a good runner, as you are in a race against the entity that is on floor 1. You will hear unnatural, almost *beast-like* screams, something comparable to a wounded animal crying for sweet release from its agony. This is the Anomaly.

As time goes on, the weeping will become distorted until all you hear is \\*something\\* screaming uncontrollably . **DO NOT APPROACH**. Leave it be. Lock the door behind you when you leave and do not return to that floor. Breaking this rule will initiate the hunt.\n\n**Rule 7**:\n\nWhen cleaning a room, ensure all lights are on until you exit.

Pray it doesn't catch you.\n\n**Rule 8**:\n\nIf you are ever on a floor and hear tapping on a door, you will have 20 seconds to make it back to the exit before the Anomaly can enter.\n\n**Rule 9**:\n\nNo two floors are ever the same. If you repeat a room, don't turn around. Don't check any of the rooms, just walk to the end of the hall and ignore the breathing on your shoulder. It will use any voice, any trauma, anything from your past to make you turn around. \\*\\*DO NOT LOOK\\*\\*. The floor isn't real. Neither is the person behind you.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 10\\*\\*:\n\nIf your eyes become foggy and you start feeling unreasonably sleepy while on floors 2, 6, and 9, enter the room closest to you and hide. The Anomaly is on the floor with you and is hiding just around the corner, ready to slaughter and dissect you the moment you walk past it.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 11\\*\\*:\n\nIf the Hunt is currently active, all rules except rules 1 and 12 are valid.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nIf you find that you have broken one of the rules, dial Mr. Haslow.\n\nThe Anomaly started clawing at the door, pounding on it continuously while shouting:\n\n\"I promised you, sweetie.\" Imitating Michelle's voice perfectly\n\nI found one last hope, the final card up my sleeve.\n\n\\*\\*Rule 12\\*\\*:\n\nIf you find that you have broken one of the rules, dial Mr. Haslow directly. He will provide you with instructions.\n\nI picked up my phone with my remaining strength and dialed the number.\n\n\"H-Hello?\" I felt a wave of relief wash over me as Mr. Haslow answered the phone\n\n\"Mr. Haslow! The Anomaly is about to breach the closet and kill me. What do I do?\"\n\nI was met with a silence that seemed to last a thousand lifetimes\n\n\"Hello? Are you there, Mr. Haslow?\" I said, still searching for a way out.\n\n\"Nice try, sweetie.\" Was all I was met with; it didn't come from the door, though. It came from the phone.\n\nAll I could do was weep, tear after tear covered my face as I realized that the Anomaly had trapped me here long before I ever stepped foot in the building.\n\nIn the moments before the Anomaly broke down the door, I found one last crumpled piece of paper. With what little strength I had left, I picked it up and unrolled it, thinking it would be a means of survival. Instead, I'm hit with the cruelest of them all:\n\n\\*Rule 13: The Anomaly can change the rules; memorize them before you leave.\"\n\nI had lost. No chance at escape. My final thoughts being transcribed into this post I share with all of you now.\n\nSo, if you ever find yourself with a janitor job that is too good to be true, remember these rules:\n\n\\*\\*Rule 1\\*\\*:\n\nYour closet is the only safe place in the building. You cannot return to it after you leave unless you are on floor 1 and rules 6 and 8 occur simultaneously.

I had just got off my shift and finally thought I had the rest of the night to myself, so I sit in the my chair, recline the seat back, grab a beer and watch my favourite show Dexter. As I sat their for hours, mindlessly staring into the realistic reality of Dexter, I hear a a crash of thunder and lightning outside, I expected this to happen as the weather report from today said hurricane Charlie was closing in on Punta Gorda. Suddenly, it goes black. “Dang it, power went out!” I shouted as Dexter was about to inject Miguel with his syringe. Sitting there, in the dark, made me realise how lonely I am. My deep thoughts were interrupted by a crash from outside from a tree being uprooted. Shocked, I headed into the basement in case any trees came smashing into my house. I head down the creaky steps, tip toeing in case the steps had been worn down since the last time being down here. In the corner of my eye, I see a silhouette move due to the flash of light from the lighting surrounding my house. I turn. I pick up a wooden bat which was a reminder to the glory days of college baseball. I slowly inch closer to the light switch, carefully trying to avoid the person in my basement. I’m an inch a way from flicking the switch, I hear mumbling and crackling from within the darkness of my cellar. I flick the switch. My face froze. My parents lay on the cold, marble floor.. Lifeless. Not only were they lifeless, there joints, ripped apart from the ligaments which used to hold them together, the corpses of my once parents, mangled but to the point I could recognises parts of their face. However, I couldn’t say the same for the rest of them. Their torso had the skin ripped off them to the point their ribcage was showing. As I look further down their bodies, the more mangled and unrecognisable they had become. As I took in the macabre scene which had unfolded in-front of me, I noticed the presence behind the mangled scene before me. A figure, almost the size of the basement, imposing on all the carnage it had made. Wet, tearing sounds came from its mouth, however, no mouth was on him. It’s long fingers plunged towards the corpse of my mother, pulling her torso from the remaining remnants of her, and devouring the entire thing. My grip on the baseball bat weakened, and due to that, I dropped it. The sound must of alerted the entity to my presence. I froze in terror. I went to run but it was as if my legs were stuck to the floor. The entity inched closer to me. It’s long fingers inching ever closer. However, its main body still incased in darkness. I finally was able to move. I ran. But tripped over on the wet, slippery blood leaking from my parent’s corpse. The creatures fingers pierced my lower back. Instantly giving me the sense of pure twisted intentions. The words were spoken in a voice that was pure, unadulterated malevolence, a demonic growl that vibrated through every cell in my body “don’t worry. You’ll be with them soon”."},"17":{"title":"A containment team failed to report back. This is the final recovered log — includes visual evidence and mentions VEC contamination.

I am new to this and this is my first time ever sharing anything. \n\n\nI live in an old apartment building just outside the city— plain, ugly brick exterior, thin walls that allow you to hear the neighbors snoring at night. The kind of place where the hallway lights take a second to flicker on. One night last week, I took the wrong stairwell looking for the laundry room and found a hallway I swear wasn’t there before.\n\nNo signs. No numbers. Just a stretch of yellowed wallpaper and buzzing lights. I thought maybe it was storage or under renovation, but… it was clean. Too clean. No dust, no sound, no exit sign. And the lights buzzed in rhythm. Like breathing.\n\nI walked maybe 20 feet before I noticed the smell—old paper and something… sweet. Familiar. And then the lights behind me started going out. One by one. Pop. Pop. Pop.\n\nI turned around and sprinted toward where I thought I came in. But the hallway had stretched—it felt longer, somehow, like it was growing while I ran. Just when the remaining lights behind me all died at once, I slammed into a door. No knob to turn. Just a push bar.\n\nI hit it hard, fell forward—and landed in the stairwell.

I would say on average two or three times a month. It’s usually not bad, I will wake up, not be able to move, but I know the drill. So I’ll just close my eyes, and wait until I can wiggle my toes to open my eyes again, so I don’t see anything that I don’t want to see. But this time, it was different.\nIt started with a dream I was having during an afternoon nap in my room. In this dream, I was at my parents’ house at night. The entire house was dark, and silent. Not a light on, except the front porch light. I was standing in the front room looking out the large window that leads to the porch. To my left was the front door of the house. Beneath the window in the front room, is a couch, which had a friend laying on who is on their phone. I didn’t know who the friend was, but in my mind, I knew it was a friend. Just not any specific one. \nAs I stand there in the room, I noticed a dark shadow swiftly move from the right of the porch to the left, towards the front door. I stepped forward to investigate what it was, but then I heard a loud noise behind me. I whip around to look into the dining room, but find only darkness. I turned back around to face my friend and see if I could find any other clues, but I noticed the front door is now slightly ajar, and the porch light is off. The only light I can see now is the light from my friend’s phone on his face. Something fell off, so I opened my mouth and began to say “something is here” to warn my friend, but halfway through my statement, I was cut off with a very intense feeling of dread and hopelessness. Something had bound me physically, and mentally. I genuinely thought that I was about to die, and I remember thinking “I didn’t even get to say goodbye to mom and dad”. I had no hope, only fear. A very intense fear. Then I woke up.\nNo, I could see the real world. I was laying in my bed, but that dreadful feeling, never left me. I am still physically bound, and an overwhelming darkness fills my mind. Now, usually when I have sleep, paralysis, if I do open my eyes, all hallucinate different things, various little creatures, usually nothing super bad. But the only consistent entity that I would hallucinate, no matter what room I’m in, the time of day, or what was going on, I would always see a tall, dark figure in the corner of my room who seemed to have no form, no body, just an intense entity of dense darkness. And this was no exception to that, apart from the fact that it was no longer in the corner of the room. This dark figure was now standing over me on the side of my bed. Despite it being daytime as this was my afternoon nap, the figure was dark. Not just dark colors, but actual literal darkness.\nI mentioned that usually I will close my eyes and wait until it’s over, but I couldn’t do that this time. The feeling was too intense, all I could do was attempt to scream to get somebody’s attention, but only quick and uneven shallow breaths could come out. I was alone. While I began to panic in this state of dread, the dark creature slowly bent over me, bringing it’s “face”, or whatever you could call it, close to mine. It spoke no words, but the closer it got to me, the louder and clearer I could hear of what I could only describe as the screams of the damned. Although it didn’t seem external, but rather coming from my own head. My own thoughts. Thousands, or millions of people screaming in pain of mental torture. I needed this to stop. The only thing I could think to do is close my eyes and pray to God and beg Him to make this stop. \nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, I was able to move one finger, and immediately my body jolted out of bed and onto all fours on the floor, completely out of breath and energy. Since this experience which happened about four years ago, anytime I’ve had sleep paralysis, that dark figure is not to be seen. It is gone. I feel what I do hallucinate, I know are hallucinations. But something about that dark creature just felt too real. It is something that I don’t like talking about. That’s why it took me four years to finally make this post and share to the world what happened to me. I need to be careful and stay close to God, as even writing the story that dreadful feeling is returning, and unusual sounds and bumps are occurring in the house. \nStay safe my friends, and may God be with you all.

We had first moved to the north-west of the country, but after a year of living there, we then relocated to the Irish midlands, as my dad had gotten a new job working in Dublin.   \n\nMy parents had bought a cottage on the outskirts of a very small village, that was a stopping point from one of the larger towns to the next. This village was so small and remote, there was basically nothing to do. But not long after moving here, and taking to exploring the surrounding area with my Border Collie, Maisie, I eventually found a large stretch of bogland containing a man-made forest. Every weekend or half-term away from school, I took to walking this area with my dog, in which I would follow along a railway line used for transporting peat. However, after months of trekking this very same bogland, I eventually stopped going there. I can’t quite recall the reason why, but maybe it was because I always felt as though I was trespassing (which I wasn’t) or because the bogland was so bumpy and uneven, I always came home with horrific blisters.  \n\nAlthough I stopped going to this bogland to walk my dog, outside one of the nearby towns where I went to school, there was a public forest. Because this forest was a twenty-minute drive away, my dad would take me and Maisie there, drop us off and then pick us up again two or three hours later. What I loved about these woods was that it was always quiet – only with the occasional family, dog-walker or jogger passing us by.  \n\nOn one particular evening, I had gone back to these woods with Maisie, where my dad would later pick us up after running some errands. Making our way along the trail, the evening had already started to dimmer. Wanting to make my way back to the car park before it got too dark, I decided to take a short cut through the forest, via one of the many narrow side-trials. Following down one of these side-trials, me and Maisie stumbled upon a small tipi-shaped hut made from logs. Loving a good game of hide and seek, I would sometimes hide inside this tipi when Maisie wasn’t looking, where she would spend the next couple of minutes circling round the hut trying to find me – not realizing she could just go inside.  \n\nWhether I played this game with Maisie that day, I’m not sure – but following down this exact same side-trail, I turn to look behind me. Staring down the entryway, I then see a man walking twenty metres behind, having just taken this side-trail... For some unknown reason, I had a strange instant feeling about this man, even though I had only just noticed him. I can’t remember or even describe the way this man was walking, but the way he did so felt suspicious to me. Listening to my instincts, or perhaps just my paranoia, I quickly latch my lead back onto Maisie and hurriedly make my way down the trail.  \n\nA few minutes later, although I had reached back onto the main trail, the evening had already turned much darker. Again turning to see if the man was behind me, I could still see him around the curve, only ten metres away from me now. I did try to tell myself I was just being paranoid, and this man was most likely not following me - but my gut instinct still told me something was off.  \n\nThinking ahead, I pull out my phone to call my dad, as to make sure he was already in the car park waiting for me – but there was no answer. Because there was no answer, I just assumed he was probably still driving – and because he was still driving, I just hoped my dad was nearly on his way.  \n\nBy the time I make it back to the car park, it was basically pitch black by now, and there was just one single car in the parking area... but it wasn’t my dad’s. Sitting down by a picnic bench to wait for him to come and get us, all I could do was hope he would be coming soon and that this strange man from the woods was not following me after all.  \n\nOnly a minute or two later, I could hear the footsteps of this very same man approaching through the darkness. Anxiously anticipating him pass by, I try to distract myself on my phone – or at least make myself seem less approachable. Thankfully enough, the man just walks completely by me. Entering the car park, the man then gets in his vehicle - the only car in the car park... but he doesn’t drive away... He just stays there, sat inside his car with both the engine and headlights turned on...  \n\nTwenty minutes must have gone by, but my dad still wasn’t here – and yet this very same stranger was... Trying to call and text my dad to say I was waiting for him, I was met with no answer. While I continued waiting, I tried to rationalize why this man hadn’t decided to drive off. Whatever reasons I came up with, they were not very convincing for me - and for those whole twenty, or however many more minutes, I sat outside those woods in complete darkness, hearing nothing but the hum of this stranger’s engine among the silent night air. \n\nWhat made this situation even more anxiety-inducing, was that my dog Maisie had been endlessly whining by my feet – scraping dirt away beneath the bench to make a surprisingly deep hole. Maisie was in general a very nervous dog and basically whined at everything – but perhaps she too felt as though something about this situation wasn’t right. \n\nThankfully, after what felt far longer than twenty-so minutes, the strange man, already with his engine and headlights on, reverses from his parking spot, exits out of the car park and onto the main road – leaving me and Maisie in peace. Although we were now alone, basically stranded outside of a dark forest, I couldn’t help but feel a huge sigh of relief come over me.  \n\nMy dad did eventually come and get us – ten minutes after the man had finally decided to drive off... Do you want to know what my dad’s excuse was as to why he was so late?... He forgot he had to pick us up. \n\nI don’t know if that man really was following me through the forest, and I definitely don’t know why he just sat in his car for twenty minutes... But if I had to learn anything from that experience, it would be the following... One: my dad can sometimes be a careless douche... and Two:  \n\nNever hike through the forest alone, late in the evening. "},"26":{"title":"NSFW-Without Reason","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1kbfqet\/nsfwwithout_reason\/","flair":null,"author":"No-Yogurtcloset-1079","selftext":"Jeromy was sitting in his rusty, washed-out Ford Focus across from his local Walmart. He had been preparing for this day for weeks; it had been all he could think about for months. Jeromy had been struggling a lot lately. It felt like everything he did was pointless. “Well, this will be the last pointless thing I do,” he whispers to himself. Jeromy reaches behind the seat and grabs his AR-15. I could be more original, but I guess there is a reason everyone chooses this one for the job. “Some say the AR-15 is a weapon of mass destruction; I believe people are.” Jeromy chuckles, “This will be fun.” Jeromy smiles; he is finally going through with it after so many nights of dreaming of this final outcome. He reaches into his blue, stained hoodie pocket, pulls out the faithful magazine, and slides it into his AR-15. He looks at the writing down the magazine well. It reads, \"Without reason.\" “Now that’s pretty original,” he says out loud. This whole world is without reason, if you really consider it. Jeromy shakes his head and focuses on the task at hand. Time to help some people get out of this shitty existence. He opens the car door; it opens with a protesting creak. There is a woman walking into the entrance with her daughter, hand in hand. Jeromy raises the AR-15 and fires off two shots. The woman’s back tears open in two places as she collapses mid-stride. The daughter, who is no more than six years old, screams and twirls around. She looks Jeromy in the eyes. Jeromy’s eyes flash like a tiger’s when it sees prey running in an open field. He squeezes off one shot. It strikes the child center mass. She is hurled to the ground as if she were hit by an NFL linebacker. I knew the hours at the range would pay off on this day of liberation. At this point, he can hear screams coming from inside the Walmart. He calmly walks through the sliding doors, making sure to put one more shot into the back of the mother’s head. That should do it. The child is still squirming like a worm on a fishing hook. He pays no mind to her. Jeromy continues through the man trap and into the store. He sees a clerk crouched behind the register. She’s quietly sobbing, “Please stop,” she pleads. “I’m doing you a favor; you just don’t know it yet,” Jeromy says, smiling at her. He raises the rifle and puts two molten-hot heaps of lead into her. She slumps and slowly slides onto her back. Jeromy takes a moment to watch the woman. She is about 23 years old, with vibrant purple hair. The woman lies supine, looking up at Jeromy with wide eyes, gasping her final breaths like a fish out of water. “The purple hair really fits you,” Jeromy says to the woman as all the red-hot life leaks out of her. The smell of copper is thick in the air at this point. I didn’t think blood would smell this strong. There’s a scuffling sound coming from two aisles down. Jeromy whips around, taking off in the direction of the sound. He rounds the corner and sees a couple huddled behind a shopping cart. “Now that won’t do any good,” Jeromy laughs. “Fuck off, you psychopath,” the man says. Jeromy’s fragile ego takes offense to this statement. He raises the rifle once again, with even more hatred this time. He squeezes off one shot. It strikes the woman in the head, spraying blood and bits of scalp onto the husband as her head snaps back as if she had been punched by a UFC fighter. The husband screams. He and the woman were getting groceries for their honeymoon. They were leaving that evening for a week-long trip that would never come to fruition. The man starts sobbing. “Well, shit man, that sucks,” Jeromy says tauntingly. Jeromy leaves the man violently sobbing in the aisle as he continues toward the back of the store. Jeromy sees the two black swing doors that lead to the stocking area. I’ve had my fun. Jeromy goes through the two doors toward his final performance. He finds a chair an employee left in a back corner. He grabs it and places it in the middle of the stocking floor. He then takes out a piece of notebook paper from his old hoodie pocket, along with a black Sharpie. He proceeds to write, “Thank you for the fun time; maybe we can do it again in the next life,” on the paper. Jeromy then sits down on the chair, takes a deep breath, and gently places the end of the rifle’s barrel against his right temple. He read that the best way of self-extraction with a firearm is to go for the temple. Too many people survive when going from below the chin. He definitely didn’t want that. The rifle goes off into eternal darkness. Parts of Jeromy go all over the cold cement floor. Jeromy’s lifeless husk slides gently down the chair until it finds a nice resting spot. Blood pours all over the note Jeromy intended for the police to find, causing the black Sharpie to smear into illegible streaks. Well, shit; guess that was pointless as well.\n\nNote: I do not support or condone mass shootings. This is just a story.

Everyone in my family was sound asleep, and I didn’t want to wake them.\n\nSo, every night, I gathered all the courage I had to face the darkness alone.\nBut the fear was overwhelming.\n\nEventually, I came up with a plan, a disgusting but desperate solution.\nI decided to relieve myself right there on the staircase, near the doorway. I know it's gross, but at that age, fear won over shame.\n\nAfterward, I would quietly sneak back into bed and fall asleep, pretending everything was fine.\nAnd this became my nightly routine peeing on the stairs around exactly 12:00 a.m.\n\nFor a while, nothing strange happened.\n\nUntil one night... the night that changed everything.\n\nAs usual, I woke up at midnight, feeling the familiar pressure in my bladder. I tiptoed to the door entrance and prepared to do what I had done so many times before. But this time... something was different.\n\nAs I was peeing, I suddenly felt a cold chill wrap around my body. The air became heavy, almost too heavy to breathe. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a faint, eerie whisper brushing past my ears. My heart froze.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw it.\n\nA shadow appeared on the wall in front of me, the figure of an old woman, not a man as I first thought.\nShe was vague, almost smoky, but her presence was undeniable. My whole body locked in fear.\n\nThen, slowly, she raised one bony hand and pointed straight at me.\nShe began to curl her finger, motioning for me to come closer.\nI heard her cracked, ghostly voice whispering over and over again:\n\"Come... come... come...\"\n\nThe sound made my blood run cold.\n\nSomehow, by pure instinct, my body broke free from the fear that had paralyzed me. I stumbled backward, rushed inside the house, and leapt into the bed where my mother was sleeping. I pressed myself against her, hoping that being near her would keep me safe.\n\nBut the nightmare wasn’t over yet.\n\nI watched with wide, terrified eyes as that shadowy old woman crawled along the wall like some nightmarish spider, creeping closer and closer toward me.\n\nShe didn’t come all the way to the bed, though.\nSomething stopped her.\nRight above my sleeping mother was a Buddha image, and it seemed like the spirit couldn’t cross past its protection.\n\nStill, the woman lingered.\nShe stood there at the edge of the room, repeating the same motion, beckoning me with her finger to come to her. Over and over again.\n\nI didn't know what else to do. I squeezed my eyes shut as tight as I could, clung to my mother, and prayed for morning to come.\n\nWhen I finally opened my eyes, sunlight was pouring into the room.\nI was safe.\n\nNo wounds, no signs of what had happened... but the memory of that night has never left me.\n\nI know what I saw was real.\nI was too young, too innocent to imagine such a thing, I didn’t even know what ghosts or horror were at that time.\n\nThat was, without a doubt, the most terrifying experience of my life.\n\nThank you for reading my story.\nI truly hope you guys believe me...🖤\nEnglish is not my first language... I let chatgpt to rewrite my story to make it more interesting.

It happened about 6–7 years ago, in the mountain village where I grew up.\n\nAbout a kilometer outside the village, there's a narrow road leading to a small soccer field, built by our community. The field lies at the edge of a dense forest, filled with towering pines. That summer, I was around 16 years old. My friends and I spent countless nights sitting in a wooden shelter next to the field, beneath the endless sky, surrounded by the deep silence of the woods.\n\nClose to the road leading to the field, there’s a sheep farm — a small, lonely place right by the roadside. One night, as we sat in the shelter, the quiet was shattered by a terrible sound.\nThe sheep were screaming.\nNot just bleating — screaming, as if being slaughtered. The sound stretched on and on, filling the night air with a raw, primal terror. We froze.\nAt first, we told ourselves it must be a wolf, maybe even a bear — predators we were all too familiar with in those mountains. But deep down, something felt wrong. The cruelty, the pain behind the sounds... it was different. More brutal. More unnatural.\n\nAfter a while, we decided to head back to the village. We walked down the dark road, passing the silent farm. Just beyond it, to the left, there’s a steep hill rising from the road, leading into the endless forest. A single tall streetlamp stands there, casting a dim, sickly light onto the hill’s edge.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw it.\n\nAt first, just a flicker of movement — then a shape, moving down the hill at an unnatural speed. It was on all fours, greyish-white in color, and it raced toward the road ahead of us, no more than 200 meters away.\nMy heart dropped.\nI shouted to my friends, asking if they had seen it — but none of them had. They thought I was imagining things.\nWe hurried to the spot where I had seen the thing descend.\nNothing.\nNo sound, no movement. It had disappeared completely.\n\nI don’t know what it was.\nBut I know what it wasn’t.\nIt wasn’t a man.\nIt wasn’t an animal.\nIt was something... else.\n\nFor years, I wondered what I had seen. I tried to rationalize it. A wolf? No — the farm dogs would have gone crazy if a wolf had come that close. But they had been silent.\nRecently, I came across videos and stories about \"Skinwalkers.\" Creatures from ancient legends, shapeshifters that lurk on the edges of human settlements. The description matches closely — too closely for comfort.\n\nI don't know if I truly saw a skinwalker that night. Maybe I never will.\nBut even now, every summer when I return to my village, I walk that same road at night — sometimes alone, with only the sound of my own footsteps and the breathing silence of the forest around me.\n\nGrowing up there, I learned not to fear the dark.\nBut what I saw that night wasn’t part of the darkness I knew.\nIt was something foreign.\nSomething that didn’t belong.\nAnd though a part of me hopes to never see it again... another part of me desperately wants to.\nTo know.\nTo understand.\n\nThank you for reading my story. I would truly appreciate hearing your thoughts and what you think I might have encountered that night."},"33":{"title":"Psychological Horror Game Ideas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k9b6dp\/psychological_horror_game_ideas\/","flair":null,"author":"Joja_bings","selftext":"I'm an indie-dev: give me your best ideas for a psychologiacal horrorgame that will make the player poop his pants or sum."},"34":{"title":"Don’t Eat Guilt-Free Meat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k8x0jm\/dont_eat_guiltfree_meat\/","flair":null,"author":"LegendarylankmanArt","selftext":"The headlines broadcasted across every news network read like a proverb:\n\nDON’T EAT GUILT-FREE MEAT.\n\nThe Hearty Harvest Corporation’s so-called “humane” meat was hailed as a global breakthrough in ethical science. The media frenzy was ravenous, and the public’s reception was universally positive.\n\nGuilt-free. Cruelty-free. Pain-free. \n\nAt least, that’s how it was sold.\n\nIt came in cans. It came in packs. It came sizzling off fast-food grills.\n\nNo animals harmed. No blood spilled.\n\nJust clean, cultured protein — “Eat with a conscience” — was the tagline plastered across billboards as you sat in traffic, morning and night.\n\nTheir influence was inescapable. Everywhere you turned, someone was talking about it. And the world, quite literally, ate it up.\n\nBut like all things floured in benevolence, there was a catch.\nOr maybe just a controversy waiting to boil over.\n\nAnd boil over it did.\n\nIt started quietly — with strange cravings. Online forums lit up with users claiming they’d lost their appetite for anything but Hearty Harvest’s so-called guilt-free meat. Vegetables, fruits, even traditional meats — none of it satisfied.\n\nOnly the Hearty Harvest meat could.\n\nThe craving soon turned into obsession.\nThen something deeper. Something primal. Was unleashed upon the masses.\n\nDoctors began to sound the alarm. The symptoms were eerily similar to high-dose opioid addiction:\nSweats. Tremors. Hallucinations.\nNight terrors.\nPeople reported vivid dreams of harming their loved ones — and worse, waking with the urge still gnawing at the edges of their psyche.\n\nThe headlines started turning against the company and the controversies stacked higher.\nViral videos emerged: people smashing into supermarkets and storming malls — not for electronics or money, but for cans, packs, patties of that damned meat.\n\nOthers broke into homes.\nHeld neighbors hostage.\nWhole apartment buildings barricaded and brutalized.\nAll for a bite.\nThe world was set ablaze, and all those who never even sampled the meat got caught in the fire.\n\nEventually, the Hearty Harvest Corp. was forced to pull the product from shelves worldwide.\nBut it was already far, far too late.\n\nWhat remained became black-market gold.\n\nThe meat sold in back alleys like it was the new sacred compound.\n\nPeople quit jobs. Quit speaking. Quit living.\nOnly the hunger remained.\nThey changed — not into beasts with fangs and claws, but something far worse.\n\nA species without empathy.\n\nDriven by a bottomless, insatiable hunger.\nAnd when the last of the meat was gone…\n\nThey turned to other sources.\n\nAnimals, devoured alive.\nPets. Neighbors. Family.\nBit by bit.\nEverything that walked, breathed, or begged for mercy — became sustenance. Anything to cater to the hollow void within them. Hoping to receive a temporary full. \n\nThe world Hearty Harvest promised — one free of cruelty — birthed something infinitely more inhuman.\nAnd far more...\n\n... Cruel.\n\n…..\n\n\nI’ve been in hiding for the last twenty months.\nSurviving. Broadcasting.\nAvoiding the Mawlers — that’s what we call them now. Those infected by the meat’s curse.\nThey’re not mindless. Not exactly. Their thoughts are still there, buried under waves of instinct, hunger, and need for survival. Their human spirit trampled under the heavy feet of their addiction.\n\nI operate under the alias Bugfeed, transmitting on radio frequency 11.1.\nBut for those who knew me before this nightmare — my name is Rachel Neugard.\n\nMy mission?\n\nTo reach whatever's left of the public.\nTo document this collapse.\nTo stitch together a narrative from the madness.\nAnd maybe — just maybe — cradle the last flickers of our humanity, with hopes of birthing a new dawn.\n\nI broadcast daily from my makeshift station.\nIf you’re out there — if you have answers — come forward.\nTell us how this happened.\nTell us how to fix it - and we can make it possible.\n\n…..\n\nOver time, survivors have offered theories. Some plausible. Some… not so much.\n“The meat was laced with cocaine or an addictive synthetic.”\nBut no traces were ever found.\n“The meat came from off-world bipedal hominoids.”\nThat one exploded. Spread by word of mouth, but yet died just as fast.\n“”The meat contains the spirit of the anti-christ.” I will not go over the possibilities of this one. As I am sure it’s in the realms of the impossible.\nThen came the whistleblower.\n\n…..\n\nAttempting to blow the top off of this organization, and the secrets they've withheld.\nHe contacted me directly — live on air — on April 18th, 2027.\nNineteen months after the first shipment of Guilt-Free meats went out.\nAccording to him, only five people knew the true formula, he dubbed them \"The Feeding Hand\".\nEach one carried a part of the code.\nThe full recipe was rumored to be written down — not stored on a drive, not encrypted in the cloud, but written. Locked away in a vault said to be strong enough to withstand even the wrath of nuclear weaponry.\nBut the material it was written on? Far less impressive on the defense scale:\n\nPaper.\n\nFragile. Flammable. Destroyable.\nDeliberately chosen for the mentioned reasons. If anyone ever tried to steal it, tamper with it, or force it out of hiding — It would ignite and burn. Reduced to embers in seconds. Its recipe — and with it, the only known antidote to this widespread disease — could vanish in an instant. One careless move, one wrong set of hands, and humanity’s last hope would be lost forever.\n\nThe vault could only be opened if all five came together.\nBut now? Their locations are unknown. Scattered like torn paper tossed to the wind.\n\nThey might be hiding - In the skeletons of urban cities, or the boneyards of the rotting countryside.\nPerhaps they’re  infected.\nOr worse — they’ve fallen victims to the very hunger they helped unleash.\nIf even one is gone…\nThe secret dies with them.\n\nNow, The Feeding Hand are being hunted  by anyone desperate enough to follow their footsteps. Tales and rumors swirl across the fractured nations - whispers of people claiming to hold the passcode, or to be one of the legendary five. \n\nSome even swear they’ve found the actual vault. But the coordinates always lead to the same deadends:\nRuins. Traps. Empty buildings. Bones. But never the impenetrable vault. Like a ghost you can only hear, but never see. \n\nYet still, I continue to search.\nBecause I have to.\nBecause if an answer exists — it’s our only shot at survival.\n\nThis is Bugfeed.\nSigning off… for now.\n\nBe safe while treading the hostile surface of our lost planet. And if you’re hearing this —\n\nIf you know anything —\nFind me. \n\nYou just may just be the one to resurrect what’s left of the fallen world.\n\n\n"},"35":{"title":"So I want to write a book","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k91zll\/so_i_want_to_write_a_book\/","flair":null,"author":"Wimches","selftext":"I wanted to write a horror book. I've been having a nightmare a few weeks ago and it still haunts me (luckily not as much as the few days after that dream). What happened in that dream wasn't really scary, as a guy just followed me around and watched me. But I think that it would make a great story. Here's a little summary:\n\nI'm home alone, my parents are grocery shopping with my siblings. The house I live in is near three cemeteries, which is kind of creepy but nothing ever happened here. It's also near a forest, yet still kinda in the city (which will be very important). So I'm making myself some food and go to my room, which is on the second floor. The weather is nice and so I decide to open my window when I see a guy in all black clothes with a mask on. The mask has one eye in the middle and a smile that kind of swirls around the eye. I get slightly startled and look away. It's not uncommon to see weird people in my city so I don't think much of it. Maybe it was just a prank? So I eat my food and then my dad calls me, he asks if I can get something from my parents bedroom, since they will be home soon and need it. I agree and go there. Now when I look out the window the guy with the mask is there again. Still staring at me and standing in our backyard. It's really creepy and for a minute or so I just stare back. It's not hard to get in our backyard, since people could just walk in but it's still weird. I wait till my parents get home and tell them what happened. My dad says that if I see that guy again (he was gone apparently), I should call him. And so I did, because the door was open and that guy stood there on the street. My parents immediately start to ask the guy questions and my mom gets near the front door. She suddenly collapses, someone threw something at her. My dad pulls her away with my uncle and I just stand there unsure of what to do. So I decide to go to the police but they didn't do much. I walked there and so I walk back. But just as I was almost home, the guy is there again. He's standing in front of my house and staring at me. He doesn't come near me but I also don't go near him. He's just staring like he always did. Then everything goes dark and I'm in a room with nothing in it. Just the guy standing in front of me. Then I woke up. After the dream I could still feel the panic when I look outside windows because I thought that guy might appear there. Also he never talked, moved or went into the house. He just stood there doing nothing.\n\nI know it's kinda much, but I really enjoy writing stories and books and I thought this could be one. Also I'm very sorry for my bad grammar, English isn't my first language."},"36":{"title":"Welcome to Wonderland: I'm working on a analog horror story but it's all written because I can't video edit. if anyone want to do it, feel free just mention me or something.

Have fun.\n\nFor most people, Lunapark is an amazing pastime. A place where you make memories for your whole life, and a place you call \"magical\". I remember, that when I was a kid I've always wanted to go there. All of those TV shows about the \"great time in the Lunapark\" and all of the newspapers. But because my family was not the richest, I've never actually been to one. So ever since I was 8 years old, it was my dream to be in a Lunapark. I remember that there was a certain TV show called \"Phil's playground\". I used to watch it with my friends when we were younger. Especially with Josh. And Josh was my best friend. We grew up together and we always had each other's back. I remember how we always had our own jokes that only we could understood.\n\n**\"Phil's playground\"**\n\nI still remember how much I loved this show. Josh and I were addicted to it. There was somthing about that show that made me feel good. we watched every day at 5PM at josh's big house. we liked all the characters, but one in particular. Phil. Oh phil. He had a strange hair, small ears and a small bracelet on the right hand that said \"its playtime!\". But the weird thing about him was his blue eyes. They were huge. Not humen. Josh and I always found it weird that his eyes didn't match his face. But we were kids so we didn't really care. We loved phil's humor and admired him.\n\n**1987 April 12th**\n\nAt that time I was 15. I still watched \"Phils playground\" with Josh but much less. Most of the time that we would meet was to do math homework and studying for tests. At April 12th, Josh and I met at his big and fancy house to do some homework.\n\nI knocked on his door. But he did not open. I knocked again and yet no answer.\n\n\"Josh? Josh where are you?\" I said. Finally, after 5 minutes of me staring at his door, he opened his door.\n\nJosh welcomed me into his home and we started to do the homework. It took us around 30 minutes to finish it. I was going to go back home but then Josh said \"hey Dean... stay for a bit more\" I kind of didn't want to stay but I did anyway. \"Did you hear what happened to Phil's Playground? \" he said.\n\n\"What? no... what happened? \"\n\n\" It got shut down... for unkonwn reason.\"\n\n\"Oh\" I sighed. \"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Nope... nobody does. Police isn't talking and the news have more important things to do.\"\n\nThen I had an idea.\n\n\"Why won't we go check what happened ourselves? I mean we are bored anyway...\" To this day, I dont know why those words came out of my mouth and why I didn't regret it. \"why not\" Josh said. \"But it's getting late we should do it tomorrow\". \n\nI took a flashlight, water and a hat. And here we were, riding on our bikes on our way to Phil's playground. I was never there and neither was Josh so we were kind of excited. It was far away, and I honestly couldn't wait to see for the first time The Phil's Playground.\n\n**Its playtime**\n\nI thought it would be difficult to get in... but the place was empty. There was nobody there. No workers, no police officers. Nothing. we started walking to the entry and left our bikes. We couldn't get through the gate because we had no tickets, but we managed to climb over the fence. \"Wow... this place is huge\" I said. And it really was. \"Not exactly the way I wanted to visit here\" Josh said. \n\nWe saw a stand of Phil's dolls. I thought it was cool,  especially because of the sound it made. \"Its playttime!\" with a cute voice. Phil's voice. Josh and I both took one and put it in our bags. We started to walk through the Lunapark and everything looked normal. Until we reached the Ferris wheel. It was still working... but there was no one to activate it. It was strange, we were alone. \"You think we aren't alone?\" Josh said. \"No... Maybe they  forgot to stop it\". It didn't make any sense but it wasn't too strange. Josh said he needs to go to the toilet, and so he did and I kept on staring at the feris wheel. I looked at every seat, but nobody was there. Except one thing. There was a weird strange blue liquid. It smelled. I didn't know why on earth would there be a blue liquid on a random seat but for some reason... I didn't really find it that weird again. \n\nBut then somthing happened. I heard laughter. I didn't know where it came from but I felt like it was behind but there was nothing there.\"Josh It's not funny\" I shouted. But he didn't answer. I went to the toilet to check if he was there. I opened the door and what I saw... gave me chills. It was this blue liquid. But not just that... where is Josh? I opened every toilet stall but what happened next... was terryfing. In the last toilet stall there was a body of a child. With a distorted face and huge eyes. I was in shock... I was scared like I had never been scared before. But what scared me the most was that Josh has disappeared. I closed the toilet stall and turned around. I looked in the mirror... and what I saw could not be real. The mirror had writing in blood on it... \"Its playtime!\" I fell to my knees in panic. My  heart dropped and I couldn't move. I didn't wanna play... I did not. I started shaking uncontrollably. Until I was brave enough to get up and punch that mirror as hard as I could. Punch after punch, until I broke it. My hand  started bleeding but I couldn't care less. \n\n5 minutes had passed and I calmed down. I started to breath more easilly and gain some control on my body. I left the toilet and closed the door. I leaned against the wall and started to think. \"Did Josh saw this and ran? Did he get away\" I could only hope he was okay. Josh was a strong guy, and he was way more brave then I was. He's definitely okay. I walked back to the Ferris wheel to see if Josh there. And surprisngly, he was. \"Josh!\" I shouted. I finally found him. \"We need to get out of here. now!\" I said. \"Why?\" he said. '' Im so glad you're okay!\". \"Why?\" he said. \"The toilets\" I said. But Josh didn't understand. He was confused... it was like he didn't notice what was in that toilet. Which I found impossible. \"What are you talking about? \"      Somthing was wrong with Josh...\"Did you play?\" He said. I didn't move. Josh turned around and went to the Ferris wheel. He got on it and sat down. He stared at me. And I stared back at him. He didn't blink, he didn't move, godamnit he didn't do nothing except staring at me. But then I noticed something... Every time I blinked, his eyes got bigger. Blink after blink, it didn't stop. This was not Josh, it was somthing else. His eyes got so big they were no longer looking human. It was terryfing... I wanted to turn around but I couldn't. For some reason, I wanted to keep staring at Josh's eyes. He stareted laughing, it wasnt his luagh, it was distorted. He started coughing blood, while his eyes kept getting bigger. Until the point that Josh's eyes were bigger then his face. Then, he just stopped. I heard a whisper. \"He wanted to play. What about you? Do you wanna play?\".\n\nI screamed. I know that whatever this thing is, made Josh go crazy. I had to turn around, I had to see it. What is the thing that killed Josh. I slowely turned around and started to breath heavier. And then I saw it. It was Phil. Just standing there. But instead of being a small and cute doll, it was tall, dark and furious. Instead of smiling, he was angry. But his eyes didn't change. It didn't move, he just stood there in front of me. I started running away from this thing. I ran as fast as I could, trying to save my life. I looked behind me... But it still didn't move. But I didn't care. I climbed over the fence, and got on my bike. \n\nI started to ride back home. I was glad I survived, but I was sad for Josh. He deserved better, he shouldn't have die like this. And it was all because of me. Poor Josh... He was a good friend. I made my way home and opened the door. It was 2AM so my parents were asleep. I went to my bedroon. and closed the door. I opened my bag to drink the water that I put in it. But then, I remembered, the **doll. It's in my damn bag.**"},"39":{"title":"I got this terrible itch...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k70n99\/i_got_this_terrible_itch\/","flair":null,"author":"Haunted_Tales_Pod","selftext":"Damn... sorry for my writing, but I’m having kind of a hard time concentrating right now...\n\nYou see, one of my hobbies is photography...

It was an absolute dream come true.\n\nWell, that was, until I stepped onto what I thought was just a piece of old and weathered metal, then suddenly broke through.\n\nLuckily, I didn’t fall too far.\n\nI don’t know what I would have done if this old factory had a giant basement... probably broke my neck and died... but I fell about nine feet before I splashed into something I first thought was oil.\n\nOnly, it kinda stank like hell and was strangely warm...\n\nOf course, I jumped up, pulled my camera out of the stuff, and luckily found a small ladder right next to the part I had fallen through.\n\nThank fuck that piece of shit held my weight, otherwise, I would have taken the second tumble into that stuff, and I don’t even want to know what would have happened to me then.\n\nAs things stood, I tried to wipe it off once I was above ground but had a hard time getting this stuff off my skin, so I stopped my outing then and there and headed back home.\n\nYou can probably imagine how pissed off I was.\n\nOh yeah, my camera won’t turn on either, so I’m pretty sure something is fried in there as well, but that’s not my biggest problem, to be honest.\n\nI hopped in the shower and scrubbed myself, especially my hands, for close to half an hour before I felt even remotely clean again. That stench was something else, and the feeling of some thin sheen of oil sticking to my skin hasn’t vanished even now.\n\nThe real problem began after, though.\n\nIt was evening and I was sitting in front of my camera, almost completely disassembled, trying to clean one tiny part after another with rubbing alcohol, but the progress was slow.\n\nThat was when that itch first started. I felt it on the back of my left hand.\n\nIt kinda reminded me of when I fell into some nettles or ivy as a child... More stinging than a mosquito bite and far smaller...\n\nIt’s hard to describe... like, imagine getting stung by hundreds of tiny mosquitoes, grouped together, all over your skin...\n\nAnd yeah, I realized then that when I fell into that hole, only my hands were completely unprotected...\n\nI couldn’t continue cleaning my camera, that’s how bad it got, even though I was wearing rubber gloves by then.\n\nMy first thought was that I had either fallen into something acidic or some kind of lye or the like... I went to the bathroom again, held my hands under the faucet, and watched the skin turn red while I switched up the temperature from almost scalding hot to as cold as it got.\n\nIt didn’t help.\n\nNot really.\n\nThis itching, stinging sensation was somehow completely unaffected by the water now. And It felt like it was coming from under my skin.\n\nI groaned and scrubbed, but it didn’t help at all. The only thing that changed was the color of my skin...\n\nIt was driving me mad... this sensation was running through both my hands and I couldn’t concentrate on anything else. It was torturous. Bad enough that I honestly thought about getting out some steel wool...\n\nDon’t worry, I stopped myself before I could go that far... I took some meds, but it didn’t help, like, at all. So I rummaged around my workbench and found two things... rubbing alcohol and an old bottle of turpentine oil, I once used to remove paint from a piece of wood.\n\nFirst off, I know it’s bad... you can get the shakes from using that on your skin... but I honestly didn’t care about that back then... I couldn’t... The itching, it was SO bad. Like millions of tiny insects crawling around the inside of my skin...\n\nI was panting and half-screaming as I took the oil with me into the bathroom, and then poured it over a part of my hand.\n\nIt felt like I was spilling lava onto my skin.\n\nThe pain was brutal enough to make me see stars, but after not even ten seconds, I suddenly felt the itch finally disappearing, and getting replaced by this dull tremor running through that part.\n\nNot thinking straight anymore, I poured the rest of the oil into the sink, then bit onto a towel and submerged both my hands in it.\n\nThe pain was blinding. I’ve never felt anything like that before... I wasn’t seeing stars, but my whole vision went bright white.\n\nMy hands were on fire and the sensation was shooting up my arms, through the shoulders, and back down into my chest. I feared I was having a heart attack from the agony and I think I blacked out since the next thing I remember is lying on the cold tiles of the bathroom, shaking like a leaf.\n\nBut the itch had stopped. Gone away completely. I felt this strange tremor in my hands, stood up, and washed them off with water once again.\n\nSome part of me feared that the itch would return, but thankfully, it didn’t...\n\nWell... not immediately, at least...\n\nI felt exhausted, so I sat back down on the bathroom floor and kept looking at my hands. Slowly but surely, they were regaining their color, even if it still seemed a tiny bit off. A slight tremor was running through them, though I think... well, hope that was just from the stress.\n\nI must have nodded off, and I came to a few hours later, suddenly feeling a stinging pain in my fingers.\n\nMy fingertips felt raw and as I woke up I noticed that I had been scratching them against the rough caulk between the tiles. There were a few drops of blood smeared around now, and the sight woke me up in an instant.\n\nIt was back. This damned itch.\n\nOnly now, it wasn’t all over my hands. Every spot I had submerged in the turpentine was okay...\n\nBut there are spots you can’t reach like that.\n\nThe skin beneath my fingernails was itching so bad...\n\nEven in my sleep, I had subconsciously tried to scratch it.\n\nI closed my hands into fists and buried my nails into my palms, but it didn’t help.\n\nIt won’t stop...\n\nI’ve tried everything.\n\nRubbing them against ice, holding them beneath hot water... I have salves and drops, I even did the turpentine bath again, but I can’t get to it...\n\nThis itch, it’s driving me up the walls.\n\nIt’s beneath every single fingernail and I don’t know what to do. I’ve started biting at the edges until they almost bleed... I nearly scratched through the nail of my thumb... it’s red and raw...\n\nI can’t go to the ER... I just can’t...\n\nThere are small black spots on my ring finger, under the nail... I think they’re forming there...\n\nIt almost looks like holes...\n\nShould I get the pliers?\n\nOr try and burn them?\n\nI don’t want to lose my finger...\n\nOh God, I think I’m going to be sick...\n\nPlease help me!\n\nPlease!"},"40":{"title":"There’s Something Seriously Wrong with the Farms in Ireland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k703v7\/theres_something_seriously_wrong_with_the_farms\/","flair":null,"author":"CosmicOrphan2020","selftext":"Every summer when I was a child, my family would visit our relatives in the north-west of Ireland, in a rural, low-populated region called Donegal. Leaving our home in England, we would road trip through Scotland, before taking a ferry across the Irish sea. Driving a further three hours through the last frontier of the United Kingdom, my two older brothers and I would know when we were close to our relatives’ farm, because the country roads would suddenly turn bumpy as hell.  \n\nDonegal is a breath-taking part of the country. Its Atlantic coast way is wild and rugged, with pastoral green hills and misty mountains. The villages are very traditional, surrounded by numerous farms, cow and sheep fields. \n\nMy family and I would always stay at my grandmother’s farmhouse, which stands out a mile away, due its bright, red-painted coating. These relatives are from my mother’s side, and although Donegal – and even Ireland for that matter, is very sparsely populated, my mother’s family is extremely large. She has a dozen siblings, which was always mind-blowing to me – and what’s more, I have so many cousins, I’ve yet to meet them all. \n\nI always enjoyed these summer holidays on the farm, where I would spend every day playing around the grounds and feeding the different farm animals. Although I usually played with my two older brothers on the farm, by the time I was twelve, they were too old to play with me, and would rather go round to one of our cousin’s houses nearby - to either ride dirt bikes or play video games. So, I was mostly stuck on the farm by myself. Luckily, I had one cousin, Grainne, who lived close by and was around my age. Grainne was a tom-boy, and so we more or less liked the same activities.  \n\nI absolutely loved it here, and so did my brothers and my dad. In fact, we loved Donegal so much, we even talked about moving here. But, for some strange reason, although my mum was always missing her family, she was dead against any ideas of relocating. Whenever we asked her why, she would always have a different answer: there weren’t enough jobs, it’s too remote, and so on... But unfortunately for my mum, we always left the family decisions to a majority vote, and so, if the four out of five of us wanted to relocate to Donegal, we were going to. \n\nOn one of these summer evenings on the farm, and having neither my brothers or Grainne to play with, my Uncle Dave - who ran the family farm, asks me if I’d like to come with him to see a baby calf being born on one of the nearby farms. Having never seen a new-born calf before, I enthusiastically agreed to tag along. Driving for ten minutes down the bumpy country road, we pull outside the entrance of a rather large cow field - where, waiting for my Uncle Dave, were three other farmers. Knowing how big my Irish family was, I assumed I was probably related to these men too. Getting out of the car, these three farmers stare instantly at me, appearing both shocked and angry. Striding up to my Uncle Dave, one of the farmers yells at him, ‘What the hell’s this wain doing here?!’ \n\nTaken back a little by the hostility, I then hear my Uncle Dave reply, ‘He needs to know! You know as well as I do they can’t move here!’ \n\nFeeling rather uncomfortable by this confrontation, I was now somewhat confused. What do I need to know? And more importantly, why can’t we move here? \n\nBefore I can turn to Uncle Dave to ask him, the four men quickly halt their bickering and enter through the field gate entrance. Following the men into the cow field, the late-evening had turned dark by now, and not wanting to ruin my good trainers by stepping in any cowpats, I walked very cautiously and slowly – so slow in fact, I’d gotten separated from my uncle's group. Trying to follow the voices through the darkness and thick grass, I suddenly stop in my tracks, because in front of me, staring back with unblinking eyes, was a very large cow – so large, I at first mistook it for a bull. In the past, my Uncle Dave had warned me not to play in the cow fields, because if cows are with their calves, they may charge at you. \n\nSeeing this huge cow, staring stonewall at me, I really was quite terrified – because already knowing how freakishly fast cows can be, I knew if it charged at me, there was little chance I would outrun it. Thankfully, the cow stayed exactly where it was, before losing interest in me and moving on. I know it sounds ridiculous talking about my terrifying encounter with a cow, but I was a city boy after all. Although I regularly feds the cows on the family farm, these animals still felt somewhat alien to me, even after all these years.  \n\nBrushing off my close encounter, I continue to try and find my Uncle Dave. I eventually found them on the far side of the field’s corner. Approaching my uncle’s group, I then see they’re not alone. Standing by them were three more men and a woman, all dressed in farmer’s clothing. But surprisingly, my cousin Grainne was also with them. I go over to Grainne to say hello, but she didn’t even seem to realize I was there. She was too busy staring over at something, behind the group of farmers. Curious as to what Grainne was looking at, I move around to get a better look... and what I see is another cow – just a regular red cow, laying down on the grass. Getting out my phone to turn on the flashlight, I quickly realize this must be the cow that was giving birth. Its stomach was swollen, and there were patches of blood stained on the grass around it... But then I saw something else... \n\nOn the other side of this red cow, nestled in the grass beneath the bushes, was the calf... and rather sadly, it was stillborn... But what greatly concerned me, wasn’t that this calf was dead. What concerned me was its appearance... Although the calf’s head was covered in red, slimy fur, the rest of it wasn’t... The rest of it didn’t have any fur at all – just skin... And what made every single fibre of my body crawl, was that this calf’s body – its brittle, infant body... It belonged to a human... \n\nCurled up into a foetal position, its head was indeed that of a calf... But what I should have been seeing as two front and hind legs, were instead two human arms and legs - no longer or shorter than my own... \n\nFeeling terrified and at the same time, in disbelief, I leave the calf, or whatever it was to go back to Grainne – all the while turning to shine my flashlight on the calf, as though to see if it still had the same appearance. Before I can make it back to the group of adults, Grainne stops me. With a look of concern on her face, she stares silently back at me, before she says, ‘You’re not supposed to be here. It was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTelling her that Uncle Dave had brought me, I then ask what the hell that thing was... ‘I’m not allowed to tell you’ she says. ‘This was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTwenty or thirty-so minutes later, we were all standing around as though waiting for something - before the lights of a vehicle pull into the field and a man gets out to come over to us. This man wasn’t a farmer - he was some sort of veterinarian. Uncle Dave and the others bring him to tend to the calf’s mother, and as he did, me and Grainne were made to wait inside one of the men’s tractors. \n\nWe sat inside the tractor for what felt like hours. Even though it was summer, the night was very cold, and I was only wearing a soccer jersey and shorts. I tried prying Grainne for more information as to what was going on, but she wouldn’t talk about it – or at least, wasn’t allowed to talk about it. Luckily, my determination for answers got the better of her, because more than an hour later, with nothing but the cold night air and awkward silence to accompany us both, Grainne finally gave in... \n\n‘This happens every couple of years - to all the farms here... But we’re not supposed to talk about it. It brings bad luck.’ \n\nI then remembered something. When my dad said he wanted us to move here, my mum was dead against it. If anything, she looked scared just considering it... Almost afraid to know the answer, I work up the courage to ask Grainne... ‘Does my mum know about this?’ \n\nSat stiffly in the driver’s seat, Grainne cranes her neck round to me. ‘Of course she knows’ Grainne reveals. ‘Everyone here knows.’ \n\nIt made sense now. No wonder my mum didn’t want to move here. She never even seemed excited whenever we planned on visiting – which was strange to me, because my mum clearly loved her family. \n\nI then remembered something else... A couple of years ago, I remember waking up in the middle of the night inside the farmhouse, and I could hear the cows on the farm screaming. The screaming was so bad, I couldn’t even get back to sleep that night... The next morning, rushing through my breakfast to go play on the farm, Uncle Dave firmly tells me and my brothers to stay away from the cowshed... He didn’t even give an explanation. \n\nLater on that night, after what must have been a good three hours, my Uncle Dave and the others come over to the tractor. Shaking Uncle Dave’s hand, the veterinarian then gets in his vehicle and leaves out the field. I then notice two of the other farmers were carrying a black bag or something, each holding separate ends as they walked. I could see there was something heavy inside, and my first thought was they were carrying the dead calf – or whatever it was, away. Appearing as though everyone was leaving now, Uncle Dave comes over to the tractor to say we’re going back to the farmhouse, and that we would drop Grainne home along the way.  \n\nHaving taken Grainne home, we then make our way back along the country road, where both me and Uncle Dave sat in complete silence. Uncle Dave driving, just staring at the stretch of road in front of us – and me, staring silently at him. \n\nBy the time we get back to the farmhouse, it was two o’clock in the morning – and the farm was dead silent. Pulling up outside the farm, Uncle Dave switches off the car engine. Without saying a word, we both remain in silence. I felt too awkward to ask him what I had just seen, but I knew he was waiting for me to do so. Still not saying a word to one another, Uncle Dave turns from the driver’s seat to me... and he tells me everything Grainne wouldn’t... \n\n‘Don’t you see now why you can’t move here?’ he says. ‘There’s something wrong with this place, son. This place is cursed. Your mammy knows. She’s known since she was a wain. That’s why she doesn’t want you living here.’ \n\n‘Why does this happen?’ I ask him. \n\n‘This has been happening for generations, son. For hundreds of years, the animals in the county have been giving birth to these things.’ The way my Uncle Dave was explaining all this to me, it was almost like a confession – like he’d wanted to tell the truth about what’s been happening here all his life... ‘It’s not just the cows. It’s the pigs. The sheep. The horses, and even the dogs’... \n\nThe dogs? \n\n‘It’s always the same. They have the head, as normal, but the body’s always different.’ \n\nIt was only now, after a long and terrifying night, that I suddenly started to become emotional - that and I was completely exhausted. Realizing this was all too much for a young boy to handle, I think my Uncle Dave tried to put my mind at ease...  \n\n‘Don’t you worry, son... They never live.’ \n\nAlthough I wanted all the answers, I now felt as though I knew far too much... But there was one more thing I still wanted to know... What do they do with the bodies? \n\n‘Don’t you worry about it, son. Just tell your mammy that you know – but don’t go telling your brothers or your daddy now... She never wanted them knowing.’ \n\nBy the next morning, and constantly rethinking everything that happened the previous night, I look around the farmhouse for my mum. Thankfully, she was alone in her bedroom folding clothes, and so I took the opportunity to talk to her in private. Entering her room, she asks me how it was seeing a calf being born for the first time. Staring back at her warm smile, my mouth opens to make words, but nothing comes out – and instantly... my mum knows what’s happened. \n\n‘I could kill your Uncle Dave!’ she says. ‘He said it was going to be a normal birth!’ \n\nBreaking down in tears right in front of her, my mum comes over to comfort me in her arms. \n\n‘’It’s ok, chicken. There’s no need to be afraid.’ \n\nAfter she tried explaining to me what Grainne and Uncle Dave had already told me, her comforting demeanour suddenly turns serious... Clasping her hands upon each side of my arms, my mum crouches down, eyes-level with me... and with the most serious look on her face I’d ever seen, she demands of me, ‘Listen chicken... Whatever you do, don’t you dare go telling your brothers or your dad... They can never know. It’s going to be our little secret. Ok?’ \n\nStill with tears in my eyes, I nod a silent yes to her. ‘Good man yourself’ she says.  \n\nWe went back home to England a week later... I never told my brothers or my dad the truth of what I saw – of what really happens on those farms... And I refused to ever step foot inside of County Donegal again... \n\nBut here’s the thing... I recently went back to Ireland, years later in my adulthood... and on my travels, I learned my mum and Uncle Dave weren’t telling me the whole truth...  \n\nThis curse... It wasn’t regional... And sometimes...  \n\n...They do live. "},"42":{"title":"I think I saw a surveillance test or something?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k6nn4j\/i_think_i_saw_a_surveillance_test_or_something\/","flair":null,"author":"SoniaStalks","selftext":"I’m not posting this for attention.

The stories about this place had always intrigued me—whispers of experiments that blurred the line between science and horror. The building itself was suffocating, its long-forgotten corridors filled with decaying walls and a silence that pressed down like a weight.\n\nWhile poking through the rubble, my flashlight beam caught something unusual: a dusty VHS tape half-buried under debris. It was old and worn, the label on it faded except for the clear, bold numbers: **“013.”** My curiosity overpowered my unease. I pocketed the tape and left the building, the chill of the place lingering on my skin.\n\nThe next day, I bought a VHS player. Something about that tape demanded answers, and I wasn’t going to let it sit idle. For an extra thrill, I decided to return to the building where I found it and play it there.\n\nThe sun was setting as I approached the structure. Shadows stretched across the windows, and I swear I saw something—a figure, motionless, staring at me from the second floor. My pulse quickened, but I reasoned it was just my imagination. Brushing it off, I stepped inside and set up the VHS player.\n\nThe tape started with static, a hiss filling the room. Then, voices:“Are you ready, 013?”“I want out,” a deep, guttural voice replied, each word laced with malice.“Alright, let’s get started—wait, what are you doing?”“I’m going to kill you,” came the reply, the tone now entirely inhuman.\n\nChaos followed—shouts, crashes, and screams.

I grabbed my things and ran, not stopping until I was back in my car.\n\n\n\nThat night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every creak of the house made me jump. Around midnight, I heard something I couldn’t ignore: footsteps. This time, they weren’t above the second floor—they were in my attic.\n\nGrabbing my gun and flashlight, I called my buddy, who thankfully agreed to come over armed as well. Together, we climbed the ladder to the attic, the cold air biting at our skin.\n\nThe space was suffocating, the silence almost tangible. As our flashlights scanned the room, I noticed scratches on the wooden beams—deep gouges, as if something had clawed its way through. My stomach churned.\n\nThen came the screech. It was deafening, echoing off the walls and freezing us in place. From the far corner of the attic, something moved. My flashlight caught a glimpse—a grotesque figure with glowing eyes, its skeletal frame and twisted limbs unlike anything I’d ever seen.\n\n“Shoot it!” I yelled, and we both opened fire. The thing screeched again, retreating into the shadows. We didn’t wait to see where it went. We scrambled down the ladder, out the door, and into the safety of the night.\n\nOnce outside, we called 911, barely able to explain what had happened. The operator’s skepticism was clear, but they promised to send someone over.\n\n\n\nWe knew we couldn’t stay at the house, so we packed what we could and left. On the way out, we stopped at a neighbor’s house to ask if they could keep an eye on things. As he agreed, I noticed something strange: a small tattoo on his wrist that read **“013.”** He noticed me staring and quickly covered it, offering a vague excuse.\n\nShaking off the unease, we drove to a nearby hotel. By the time we arrived, exhaustion was catching up with us. We checked into our room, triple-locked the door, and inspected every corner. The room seemed normal, but the tension was suffocating.\n\nAfter settling in, we decided to run to the store to grab dinner. When we returned, we froze in the doorway. Sitting in the middle of the room was the VHS player, the same tape inside.\n\n“What the hell?” my friend whispered, his voice shaking.\n\nWe immediately called the police, telling them everything: the tape, the attic, the creature, and now this. Two officers arrived within the hour. They listened, but their skepticism was clear.\n\n“Alright, let’s see this tape,” one of them said.\n\n\n\nThis time, the tape began differently. A timestamp appeared: **1\/13\/1994.**“Subject 013: Experimental Cognitive Variance,” a voice announced.\n\nThe audio crackled, and screams erupted. A younger voice, presumably 013, pleaded for release. The sound of electric buzzing followed, growing louder. Suddenly, a crash—metal restraints breaking.\n\n“Restraints breached!” someone yelled. Chaos erupted. The audio captured the sounds of bodies being thrown against walls, panicked screams, and desperate commands:“SECURITY! Get him back in the—”\n\nA guttural, otherworldly screech drowned out the voices, and the tape cut to static.\n\nThe officers exchanged uneasy glances. “That’s enough,” one of them said, reaching to eject the tape.\n\nBut then, the room went cold. The lights flickered, and a low growl filled the air. From the shadows, the creature emerged—its glowing eyes and skeletal frame unmistakable.**I’m Schizophrenic but I know what I saw was real.**\n\nThree nights ago, I decided to explore an abandoned building near the infamous Montauk Project site.

We were hanging out at his place, just playing some games, when he paused mid-match and looked at me with this blank stare.\n\n“You ever think about what it’d be like to wear someone else?” he asked.\n\nI laughed, thinking he meant metaphorically. Like, empathy or whatever. But then he said:\n\n“No, I mean like literally. Stepping into their skin. Their bones. Would anyone notice?”\n\nI stared at him, waiting for the punchline, but he just blinked slowly and turned back to the game like nothing happened.\n\nThat was the first time I got this weird chill around him.\n\nSince then, it’s only gotten worse. He’ll say something completely out of character—like talking about my childhood dog, Max, who died when we were ten. Except… I never told him about Max. Ever. That was before we met. I asked him how he knew, and he just said:\n\n“I remember more than you think.”\n\nI tried brushing it off. Maybe he saw a photo or heard it from someone else. But then I noticed something else: Jake doesn’t blink like normal anymore. He’ll just stare at me, unblinking, for minutes. Like he's studying me.\n\nThree days ago, he showed up at my apartment unannounced. I was in the shower, and when I stepped out, he was just… sitting on my bed. Smiling.\n\n“I made a copy,” he said.\n\n“What?”\n\n“A better version. Less doubt. Less fear. You’ll see.”\n\nHe left without explaining. No texts, no calls. Just gone.\n\nUntil tonight.\n\nI just got home from work. My apartment was dark, but something felt off—you know that gut feeling that tells you you’re not alone? Yeah. That.\n\nI turned on the lights and everything looked normal, until I saw the mirror in my hallway.\n\nThere were two sets of wet footprints on the hardwood floor. Both leading in.\n\nAnd in the mirror… it was me.\n\nBut it wasn’t.\n\nThe reflection smiled first.\n\nThen it moved when I didn’t.\n\nI turned around—nothing there.\n\nBut I just got a text from Jake. The real Jake. The number is different, unlisted.\n\nAll it says is:\n\n“Don’t trust the one that calls you ‘buddy.’ That’s how it starts.”\n\nGuess what the thing in my living room just called me when I walked past?\n\n“Hey, buddy.”\n\nI’m locking myself in my room. If I don’t update this… don’t open your door when your best friend shows up acting strange.\n\nIt might not be them anymore.\n\n"},"48":{"title":"I remember something from back before I was born","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k42y7f\/i_remember_something_from_back_before_i_was_born\/","flair":null,"author":"Trexxx_10","selftext":"So let me explain I was born in 2011 and from what i remembered the apartment blocks behind my houses had there parking lot filled with gravel around 2015 cause I distinctly remember my 2nd freind who lived in those apartment blocks saying \"yeah it's abit sad that the grass is gone but it makes more sense\" but I went to look at google earth and using there history feature which let's you look back at different satellite images of earth at different times, so I searched in my address since the apartment blocks are right behind it and I go to 2015 and it still has gravel in it this surprised me because I remember it getting filled in 2015 I knew It did so I went back farther and learned that the satellite images show me that it was filled in 2011, 2 months before I was born I obviously thought that this was wrong so i decided to ask the actual people in the apartment blocks door after door after door they all said they thought It happened in 2015 so after this I knew that I wasn't the only one who thought this and after this I decided to look it up online and found all the articles I could find said that It was filled in 2011 but after countless hours of searching I found it and article that said parking lot in barb ohio got filled in 2011 but countless people remember it happening in 2015 it was from a blog account named the Alabama searcher in the article it correlated this event with the world ending In 2012 and how we were sent to a different dimension after 2012 and thats why some events got changed or completely recalled so I decided to call up my 2 old freinds who lived at the apartment block through 2007 to early 2016 they were really happy to hear from me since they haven't seen me since 2016 so I tell them about this and they agree to help me so a little later my 2 old freinds Carter and Molly come to my house and we decide to dig In the parking lot at 3 different points after around 2 hours of digging Carter hits something we rush over to him and help him dig the rest out we find the old grass in the ground but in the middle was Carters long dead body."},"50":{"title":"Amber Alert","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k3pvuo\/amber_alert\/","flair":null,"author":"Sad_Advice_7783","selftext":"\n\nYou watching TV and then the news flickers on it saids\n\n\"Warning, warning!

We really wanna live together, but we are just waiting for our unis to finish so we can get a proper job.\n\nThis time, she was coming to Japan to see me, I was just chilling at my house at the time, and she called me saying that she was close, and then I brushed my hair and changed clothes to see her, I was with a jeans jacket with my pocket sketchbook and phone in it, then she called me. We started smilling to each other in the video call, and she said that she was already walking up the stairs to see me, so I said I was going to walk down the stairs to kiss her, so we both were walking the stairs with out smartphones on hand.\n\nBut, I walked all the way down and didn't see her, while she walked all the way up to my front door, and didn't see me, weird, I aksed if she didn't enter the other building instead of mine, and no, she was exactly at my front door on her camera. So I just ran back up to my house to meet her.\n\nWe hugged and kissed and she was carring her big backpack in her bag, I took it from her and opened the door so she could walk in, she as cute as always walked in smilling, but something felt off, my house was off somehow, but I didn't notice anything strange, just felt off. Later remembering it, when we came to my room, I saw a big mirror reflecting the corner of the room, this mirror wasn't there before, but I didn't feel weird about it at first, it was just unerving.\n\nMy girlfriend was cuddling with me at my bed, then she said she wanted to drink some water, so she went to take it. I was in my room while I head she talking to herself, like I was there with her, but I was dissociating a bit because of the mirror, everything was so weird, I started to feel eerie about everything, it was like I was loosing trust in my senses, and what the heck was that mirror doing in my room? Whose voice was that in the kitchen with her? I just stood up, took my jacket and walked at her.\n\n\"There is something wrong happening, we need to leave. Now.\" She looked confused at me and asked \"What u talking about, silly?\" And I answered very serious \"We really need to leave, there is something strange happening here.\".\n\nShe was still confused, and I don't blame her, but she started picking her stuff up. I put on my shoes and holded the door to her on my way out, and while she was putting on her shoes, I could see the mirror from my point of view, it was still pointing at the corner of the room, but there was nothing there, while she was finishing putting on her shoe, from the mirror I saw her peek at me, smile, and wave, and vanished again in the mirror.\n\nIt was terrifying, it was exactly her in the mirror, but it didn't make any sense, I looked at her and she saw my face. \"What did you see?\" she asked me, starting to get a little scared. \"I saw you in the mirror, smiling at me while we leave.\" She knew I was being serious, I closed the door behind us, and we started walking down the stairs of the building, while I was leaving, I noticed that the lights from the building were a little pinkier, just a small detail, the white light was slightly pinkier.\n\nShe didn't really ask, or talked to me while we were walking away from the building, until we reached the usual streets and a small park that had around where I lived.\n\n\"You ok?\" I asked. \"Yeah, what happend? You was just in the kitchen with me, and then we where leaving the house. This is not funny, you're scaring the shit out of me.\" She was getting upset, and I noticed that she was sweating a little, I don't know why but it was hot outside, like really hot. I cleaned her forehead and explained everything to her, while we were sitting in the park under a tree.\n\nWe started noticing kids wearing towels arond their necks, something that is usual especially in summer in Japan, tank tops, shorts and towels, and then Catie( little cutie nickname) took of her jacket. \"What do we do now?\" she asked. I just didn't now what to say, was it all real? I took my phone to see the temperature, 28 °C... but around that time of the year, which was April, the temperature shoudn't be that high... Then I looked at the date next to the temperature. July 25th... 2023. Everything was just getting weirder and weirder. I showed it to her.\n\nShe looked at me in shock. \"It doesn't make sense\", I saw her getting anxious, breathing faster, when I was going to hold her hand, something pulled me from behind, my vision was getting blury.\n\nI was in my room again.\n\nThe same place from when she went to the kitchen.\n\nI heard a lot of noise coming from the front door, I was so fucked up, I didn't know what to do, and a terrible headache, ears ringing. And then, the noise stopped, a familiar voice came from the front door, my parent were back from the groceries. I went on to talk to them, I started to try and explain what was happening to them, and they just looked and me and said \"Are you an idiot? I can't understand anything that you're saying.\"\n\nI just ignored them, and took my phone out to see if I still could talk to Catie, and the date was just the same, first thing that I noticed, April 22... 2024. The same day it was when she first called me from downstairs. What whas happening?? Somehow I could call her, but the call was just horrible, the image was terrible, but somehow we could still talk to each other, she said that she was fine, and that I just vanished in front of her, like in a blink of an eye.\n\nAt this point we were just trying to figure something out, on how to be toghether again, and bring her back to the actual time. So while in call with her I told her to meet me in front of the building, before I left I took the jacket again, the mirror wasn't in my room anymore, and neither my parents were home anymore, I litereally just saw them, but anyways I started heading downstairs.\n\nWhen I started heading downstairs I noticed the lights changing just a little bit to that weird pinky white from before, so instead of keep heading downstairs, I started walking back up. I went to my door and checked the house... The mirror was there.\n\nCatie later told me that when I was heading downstairs, she just saw me appear from one floor to another, and then started heading up again, she also said that all our messages were giving an error in her phone, something like \"Can't open messages from recent version of the app, update it to see new messages.\".\n\nGetting back to the mirror, I just closed the door as fast as I could, I didn't want to look at it anymore, and ran down the stairs, but when I was heading down the stairs, the pink light started to get to the normal color again, so I stopped and looked down, Catie wasn't there anymore, and she said I vanished again in between floors. So I tryied something.\n\nI went back up, opened and closed the door, no mirror there btw, and then started running back down again, and she saw me. We hugged so strong, I can even remember her warmth from that hug, then I asked her to hold my hand and don't turn off the phone call, she held my hand very strongly, like she wanted to break my fingers, I could tell how scared she was, me too, at least I felt safer with her again.\n\nSo we started walking upstairs together, and I saw the lights change again, normal tone, I turned off our call and we got back again in front of my front door, while still holding her hand, I opened the door.\n\nNo mirror.\n\nParents talking in the kitchen.\n\nSight of realief from both of us, so we just went back to my room, together, and held hands for a while, still processing all that happened, she smiled at me. I gave her a kiss."},"57":{"title":"Those Who Wander Alone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k1d27q\/those_who_wander_alone\/","flair":null,"author":"OnlyOneBT","selftext":"The fireplace crackled, casting long shadows across the cabin walls. Outside, the wind howled through the pines, a mournful sound that made the old timber frame creak and groan. The blizzard had been raging for two days now, and there was no sign of it letting up.\n\nGrandfather leaned forward in his rocking chair, his weathered face illuminated by the dancing flames. Across from him, his grandson Tommy sat cross-legged on the bearskin rug, wide-eyed and eager. Behind Grandfather, his shadow stretched against the wall.\n\n\"You sure you want to hear this story, boy? It's not for the faint of heart.\" Grandfather's voice was like gravel underfoot, worn smooth by years and whiskey.\n\nTommy nodded eagerly. \"I'm twelve now, Grandpa. I'm not scared.\"\n\n\"Twelve is a good age,\" Grandfather nodded once. \"Strong enough to hear hard truths.\" He took a long sip from his steaming mug. \"Time you learned about the Wendigo.\"\n\n\"The monster from the stories?\" Tommy's voice betrayed a hint of nervousness despite his bravado.\n\n\"Not just stories.

Escaped by luck and nothing else.\" He leaned closer. \"Want to hear about it?\"\n\nTommy nodded, pulling his blanket tighter around his shoulders.\n\n\"Alright then. But remember this-it listens. It watches. Even now.\" Grandfather glanced toward the window, where snow pelted against the glass like tiny desperate fists. \"Especially in storms.\"\n\nGrandfather settled deeper into his chair, his eyes growing distant as he sank into memories. The cabin seemed to grow quieter, as if the very walls were leaning in to listen.\n\n\"The most recent time was about fifteen years ago, before you were born. I was working as a forest ranger up near the Canadian border. Beautiful country, but lonely. My cabin was the only human dwelling for twenty miles in any direction.\n\n\"Winter came early that year. By late October, we were already snowed in. Supply drops came by helicopter once a month, but a storm rolled in just when I was expecting a drop. Radio communication went down too. I was completely cut off.\n\n\"After a couple days, my food was running low. The weather was still too bad for supplies. That's when I first noticed the tracks outside my cabin-like deer hooves, but larger, deeper. They circled the entire perimeter, as if something had been pacing, looking for a way in.\n\n\"That night, I heard knocking at my door. Three slow, deliberate knocks.\n\n\"'Hello?' called a voice. 'Is anyone there? I'm a hiker. I got lost in the storm.'\n\n\"Now, I knew that wasn't possible. No hiker could have made it through that blizzard, and the nearest trail was miles away. But the voice-there was something about it that pulled at me. Something familiar I couldn't quite place.\n\n\"'I can see your chimney smoke,' the voice called. 'Please, I'm freezing out here.'\n\n\"Something felt wrong. The voice was too calm for someone who'd been wandering in a blizzard. But even stranger-it seemed to know things it shouldn't. 'I can see you sitting by your radio,' it said. 'The one with the broken antenna. I can help fix it.'\n\n\"I hadn't told anyone about the broken antenna. Hadn't had a chance to.\n\n\"I approached the window instead, thinking I'd get a look before deciding. The temperature in the cabin plummeted. My breath clouded before my face, and the fire dimmed as if starved for air.\n\n\"Through the frost-covered glass, I could make out a figure in the moonlight. A man in hiking gear, his back to me, looking out at the forest. As if sensing my gaze, he began to turn.\n\n\"I ducked away before seeing his face. Some instinct warned me not to look. In the window's reflection, I glimpsed something tall behind the hiker-something with a crown of shadows that moved like antlers.\n\n\"'I know you're in there,' the voice said, suddenly right at the window. 'Why won't you help me?'\n\n\"I sat with my back against the wall, beneath the windowsill, heart pounding. 'The ranger station is two miles south,' I lied. 'Follow the trail markers with reflectors.'\n\n\"Silence followed. Then came a sound I'll never forget-a soft laugh that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The air filled with a scent like frozen pine needles and something else, something metallic and ancient.\n\n\"'But you're here,' the voice said, softer now. 'And I'm so hungry.'\n\n\"All night it stayed outside, sometimes knocking, sometimes calling in different voices-a woman, a child, an old man. Always knowing details it shouldn't: the titles of books on my shelf, where I kept my spare keys, the name of my childhood dog. By dawn, the noises stopped. When I finally looked outside, the strange tracks were gone, filled in by fresh snow. But at the edge of the clearing stood a single birch tree that hadn't been there the day before.\n\n\"The storm broke that afternoon. A helicopter came with supplies the next day. I never told anyone what happened. Who would believe me?\"\n\nTommy stared at the window, as if expecting to see something there. The fire popped suddenly, making him jump. Outside, the wind seemed to pause, as if listening.\n\n\"But you'd seen it before?\" Tommy asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nGrandfather's eyes grew distant again. The lines in his face deepened as he nodded slowly. \"Yes.\" He took a slow breath before continuing, rolling back the years with each word. \"It finds those who are alone in the wild. And it's patient... so very patient.\"\n\nHis gaze focused on something far beyond the cabin walls. \"I was in my thirties, back in the 1970s. I worked for a nature magazine, traveling to remote places to take photographs. That particular winter, I was assigned to capture the northern lights in the Minnesota wilderness.\n\n\"The editor wanted something special-aurora borealis reflecting off pristine, untouched snow. No cabins, no roads, nothing man-made in the frame. Just pure wilderness under those dancing lights. The kind of shot that makes you feel tiny in the universe.\n\n\"I packed enough supplies for two weeks and hired a bush pilot to drop me at a remote lake thirty miles from the nearest town. The pilot thought I was crazy going alone in January.\n\n\"'Radio check-in every night at seven,' he insisted. 'Miss two in a row, and I'm coming to get you, pictures be damned.'\n\n\"The first few days were magical. Complete solitude. The silence of those woods-you can't imagine it, Tommy. Not silence like an empty room. Silence like the world before humans existed. I'd spend all day scouting locations, then set up my cameras at dusk and wait through the frigid nights for the lights to appear.\n\n\"On the fourth night, the aurora was spectacular-curtains of green and purple rippling across the stars. I was moving between my three camera setups when I noticed something odd. A dark patch in the snow about a hundred yards out on the frozen lake. I was certain it hadn't been there during my setup.\n\n\"Through my telephoto lens, I could just make out a figure standing perfectly still. A person, facing away from shore, looking up at the sky.\n\n\"My first thought was relief-another photographer! Even brief company would have been welcome after days alone. I called out, but my voice seemed swallowed by the vastness. The sound traveled wrong, as if the words froze before they could reach across the ice.\n\n\"I decided to approach. The ice was thick enough to hold a truck this time of year, so I wasn't worried about that. But with each step I took toward the figure, the temperature dropped noticeably. My eyelashes began to frost over. And something felt increasingly wrong. It never moved, not even slightly. No shifting of weight, no turning at the sound of my crunching footsteps. And strangest of all-no breath cloud in the bitter air.\n\n\"About halfway across the lake, I stopped. Some primal instinct told me to go no farther. I raised my camera instead and took a series of photographs with my flash.\n\n\"The figure still didn't turn, but it... changed somehow. Even from behind, I could tell its proportions were wrong-too tall now, too thin, its head oddly shaped.\n\n\"A cloud passed over the moon, plunging the lake into momentary darkness. When moonlight returned, the figure was gone. The dark patch in the snow remained.\n\n\"I retreated to my tent, heart pounding. For hours, I heard footsteps circling-sometimes near, sometimes far, but always returning. The air in my tent filled with that same scent-frozen pine and something older, something that didn't belong in this century. Toward dawn, the footsteps stopped directly outside my tent. Then came a soft voice, barely above a whisper.\n\n\"'Your cameras are still out there. Don't you want to collect them before the snow comes?'\n\n\"I remained silent, paralyzed with fear.\n\n\"'I've seen what you're trying to capture,' the voice continued. 'But your photographs will never show the true beauty of this place. I could show you perspectives you've never imagined.'\n\n\"The voice was gentle, almost hypnotic. Despite my terror, I found myself reaching for the tent zipper.\n\n\"A sudden gust of wind shook the tent, breaking the spell. I huddled in my sleeping bag until sunrise, radio clutched to my chest, too frightened even to call for help.\n\n\"In the morning, I found my cameras untouched. Around my tent were those distinctive tracks-like deer hooves but impossibly large and deep. They led to each camera, lingered, then continued to my tent before disappearing into the treeline.\n\n\"When I developed the film later, every shot of the northern lights showed the same thing: a tall, antlered silhouette at the frame's edge, just barely visible against the stars. In each sequential photo, it was closer to the camera position. In the final frame, it stood directly behind the tripod, its elongated shadow stretching toward the lens.\n\n\"The strangest photo, though, was one I didn't remember taking. A self-portrait, apparently triggered by the timer, showing me standing at the lake's edge, looking out at the ice. Behind me, half-hidden in shadow, stood something impossibly tall with a hand-not quite a hand-reaching toward my shoulder. But what truly chilled me was my own expression in the photo-serene, almost joyful, as if I was about to step into an embrace.\n\n\"I never showed those photos to anyone. But I keep them still, as a reminder of what waits in the wilderness for those who wander too far alone.\"\n\nTommy's eyes were wide now, his earlier bravado gone. \"Can I see the photos?\"\n\nGrandfather's expression softened strangely. \"Sure. Once we're home.\"\n\nTommy shifted under his blanket, suddenly cold despite the fire's warmth. A silence settled between them, filled only by the soft popping of the fire and the distant moan of the wind. The grandfather's eyes lingered on the boy's face, studying his reaction as if searching for something.\n\n\"There was another time,\" Grandfather said finally, his voice lower now, almost reverent. \"Earlier still, when I was younger than your father is now.\" He leaned back, his silhouette merging with the shadows behind him. \"Each encounter was different, you see. It learns. It adapts. But it always hungers.\"\n\n\"I had taken a job as a fur trapper to save money for college. I had a line of traps spanning several miles through the northern woods.\n\n\"One December day, a blizzard blew in while I was checking my far traps. I knew I wouldn't make it back to my cabin before nightfall, so I headed for an old emergency shelter that the previous trapper had built-just a small shack with a woodstove.\n\n\"The wind had a voice that day. Not just howling, but something more articulate, almost like words just beyond understanding. I kept looking over my shoulder, feeling watched, though nothing was visible through the thickening snow.\n\n\"I was about a mile from the shelter when I noticed someone walking ahead of me on the trail-another trapper by the look of him, hunched against the wind. The sight of him was strange, though. In such a whiteout, he should have been a barely visible silhouette, but I could see him with unusual clarity, as if he existed separately from the storm around him.\n\n\"'Hello there!' I called, but my voice was lost in the wind.\n\n\"I tried to catch up, but no matter how fast I walked, he remained the same distance ahead, always just visible enough to follow. It struck me as odd that I never got closer, but I was grateful for the company and the broken trail through deepening snow.\n\n\"He led me straight to the shelter. When I arrived, the door was ajar, but there was no one inside. No footprints led away from the door either-just my own tracks arriving, and those I had followed, which mysteriously ended at the threshold.\n\n\"Inside, I found the woodstove already lit and warm, a pot of stew bubbling on top. A single wooden chair was pulled up to the small table, as if awaiting a guest. On the table sat a pocket watch I recognized immediately-it had belonged to my grandfather. I'd left it at home, a hundred miles away.\n\n\"The air in the shelter smelled different from the snow outside-older, earthier, with that same metallic undertone I'd come to recognize years later.\n\n\"I was starving and cold, so despite my unease, I sat and ate. The stew was unlike anything I'd tasted-rich and satisfying in a way that seemed to warm me from the inside out. I emptied the pot and promptly fell into the deepest sleep of my life.\n\n\"I dreamed of running through the forest on four legs, tireless and free, under a full moon. Of knowing every shadow and hollow of the woods as intimately as the lines on my own palm. In the dream, I wasn't alone-there were others running with me, their forms shifting between human and something else entirely.\n\n\"When I woke the next morning, the blizzard had passed. The woodstove was cold, as if it hadn't been lit in weeks. The pot was gone, and in its place lay a small, yellowed human tooth.\n\n\"I left immediately, abandoning my traps and gear. When I finally made it back to town and asked about the previous trapper who'd used that shelter, the old-timers fell silent. Eventually, one told me he'd disappeared ten years earlier during a winter storm. 'The woods claimed him,' was all they would say.\"\n\n\"Strange thing was,\" Grandfather added, his voice dropping to a near whisper, \"when I got home, I found my grandfather's pocket watch exactly where I'd left it. But when I opened it, the glass was foggy, as if it had been out in the cold. And inside the case was a single, small pine needle that hadn't been there before.\"\n\nTommy shivered, but he leaned closer, captivated.\n\n\"You understand, don't you?\" Grandfather asked softly. \"You feel it too-the call of the winter woods.\"\n\nTommy hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Sometimes... sometimes I dream about running through snow. But I'm not scared in the dreams. I feel... free.\"\n\nGrandfather's smile deepened. \"Of course you do. The wild is freeing.\"\n\nGrandfather fell silent, staring into the fire. Outside, the wind had died down, as if the storm itself was listening, waiting for the final tale.\n\n\"More?\" Tommy asked quietly, his voice small yet eager despite the fear that had crept into it. Something in his eyes reflected his grandfather's gaze-a curiosity that ran deeper than caution.\n\n\"One last story,\" Grandfather said, his tone changing, as if he were speaking from a place more primal than memory. \"The first time.\"\n\n\"I was eight years old,\" he began, his clipped style softening slightly. \"Lived in a small house at the edge of town. My bedroom window faced the woods.\"\n\n\"One winter night, I woke to tapping on my window. Like fingernails on glass. I was scared, but curiosity pulled stronger. I looked through the curtains.\"\n\n\"In the moonlight stood Billy Mercer, a boy from my school. He'd gone missing three days earlier during a family camping trip.\"\n\n\"'Let me in,' he said. His breath didn't fog the glass despite the cold. 'I've been lost in the woods. Found my way back, but my parents aren't home.'\"\n\n\"Something was wrong. His eyes reflected the moonlight like an animal's. His clothes were too clean-the same ones from when he disappeared.\"\n\n\"I told him I'd wake my parents so they could call his family.\"\n\n\"'No,' he said sharply. 'Don't wake them. Just let me in. I'm cold.'\"\n\n\"He pressed his hand against the glass. His fingers were too long, the joints bent strangely.\"\n\n\"I backed away. His face changed then-not angry, but deeply sad. Like he'd lost something precious.\"\n\n\"'Don't you want to play in the woods with me?' he asked. 'I've found the most wonderful places.'\n\n\"As he spoke, I caught my own reflection in the glass, overlaying his face. For just a moment, we blended together.\n\n\"I ran for my parents. When they checked, nothing was there-just strange tracks in the snow.\n\n\"Next day at school, they announced they'd found Billy's coat. Never found Billy himself.\n\n\"When spring came and snow melted, hikers found a cave in the forest. Inside were children's things arranged like a tea party. My jacket was there too. But I'd never lost it.\"\n\nGrandfather's eyes seemed to look inward. \"Sometimes, I still see him. In still water. In dark windows. Watching.\"\n\nThe fire had burned low. The cabin felt cold now.\n\nTommy's blanket pulled tight. \"Why do we come here every winter?\"\n\n\"To remember.\" Grandfather's smile didn't reach his eyes.\n\nHe added a log to the fire. Flames lit his face different now. Tommy saw the deep shadows in his grandfather's eyes. How they caught light but didn't hold it.\n\n\"The forest is a lonely place,\" Grandfather said, words sparse like the trees in snow. \"Cold. Silent. Vast.\"\n\nHe stood with strange grace. Moved to the window. His outline against the glass seemed wrong somehow. Too tall. Too angular.\n\n\"Those stories are true.\" His voice held echoes. Other voices beneath. \"But the endings might not be.\"\n\nTommy watched his grandfather's hands. Had his fingers always been that long? That oddly bent?\n\nHe turned to Tommy, hand extended. \"You hear them too. The woods calling.\"\n\nOutside, the snow had stopped. The pines stood dark and waiting.\n\nThe fire burned out. Shadows danced on walls. Like antlers.\n\nBy morning, fresh tracks led away from the cabin door-one set large and strange, the other small and human, walking side by side into the endless white of the winter woods."},"58":{"title":"Red light in my mirror","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k0rb1w\/red_light_in_my_mirror\/","flair":null,"author":"Choice-Progress-7077","selftext":"\nShort story I am working on for a creative writing class, not done yet. Any advice is appreciated, I’m not a great writer.\n\n\nThe world is black, I am in a man’s room, it looks like my room, but who knows. The line between dream and reality is blurred. The man is sleeping, or am I sleeping? I see a figure exit from the shadows of who knows where, going to the man in bed. The man is unaware. Am I the one in the bed? The intruder slowly puts its hands around the man’s neck, and I feel my throat close up. I scream to warn the man, just as I scream the man screams as well. He must have woken. From the other side of the bed that was covered by the shadows, a woman emerges. Maybe his wife?  Maybe my wife? The woman shakes the man, and my vision goes fuzzy.\n\n I open my eyes and I am greeted with harsh light and my wife shaking me. “It happened again,” she said, looking shaken up. I nod slowly, trying to remember what happened, but nothing comes to mind. All I feel is raw, deep fear and I don’t know why. I apologize to my wife, promising I’ll get help, I never do though, and I think by now she knows that. \n\nSome time has passed and my wife has fallen back asleep, I can hear her snoring softly. Careful not to wake her I get up and go to the bathroom. Shutting the door behind me, I see a weird glow from the mirror. I turn on the light and the glow disappears, just like every night for the past 3 weeks. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t think of it too much, my wife says I am just seeing things. I look in the mirror and see dark red marks on my neck, suddenly I feel this tingling sensation and my blood suddenly goes cold, it’s like I feel it all over again, but I don’t know what I am feeling. Hands are on my throat now, but I know they really aren’t, it’s all in my head I tell myself, splashing cold water on my face, but deep down inside, I don’t think it is. \n\n\tMy wife is out with friends, I had to do some paperwork. I’m alone, but I don’t feel alone, there’s something greater in this house, and I feel it even more now. It is nighttime, and it is dark. When I see the sunset I always go to look at the light in the mirror, tonight was no different. Just as I knew it would be, the light was there, seeming bigger than before. My heart is pulsing, and I think my head is going to explode. I reached for the advil on the counter, but hit my head on the corner of the mirror. \n\n\tMy head splits and I feel my brain explode out on the bathroom counter, oozing on the linoleum tile. My wife always hated that ugly red tile. We were going to replace it, but we never did. \n\nI am out of my body now and I want to scream, but I can’t. How can I scream when my entire face blew up, when I can see my brain spilling everywhere. When my eyeballs are melting and my face morphs into something hideous. \n\nI try to breathe. Breathe. Breath. Breath. I get like this. So many times. I wanted to be a doctor once. Make my family proud. I was in an anatomy class, dissecting a real body, but that was my body. I was watching a man dissect his own body, my body. The smell of formaldehyde was lingering on me for weeks, but no one believed me.  I am not cut out for the medical field. Not when I see myself getting cut out. \n\n\tAfter what feels like hours and lifetimes and also just seconds, the only man I see is the one looking back at me across the sink, the cracked mirror darkening his features. The red light switches on and off, testing me, teasing me, but I see something I have never seen before. I see emptiness beneath the mirror that cracked. A narrow hallway that seems to go forever. If that wasn’t proof enough, I feel a cold draft from that labyrinth that once was a mirror. \n\t\n\tI gaze down at the red floor, where my brain had been just a minute ago, with pieces of skull jutting out. It is completely clean though. The light blinks again and I lose it. I start punching the mirror, my blood oozes off my hands, shards of glass embedded deep in my trembling palms. I move to lick at my wounds, the metallic taste meeting my tongue. This taste exhilarates me because for once it isn’t in my head. \n\n\tI don’t bother to remove the glass. It is my armor and my war medal. The shards are trusty steeds, their blood a friendly slobber, like when a dog licks your hand. My brass knuckles made of mirrors will protect me from the world and my brain. I tell myself that because for once I feel grounded.\n\n\tI slowly move in just to get a slight view of the area. I will come back later with a flashlight, but I need to prove right now that this is real. I see no one, not even myself, so it must be real. I go in and my head goes silent. I love this, but then I see the red light. “Looks like we got company,” I muse to myself, a slight chuckle escaping my lips. I have no reason to laugh, but when you are in a bathroom mirror hallway most things seem funnier. \n\n\tI am determined to see that red light, make my discovery, prove the world wrong. I walk a bit more, until the light from the mirror runs dim. \n"},"59":{"title":"UNSTILL. \/\/ 202200668","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1k0m6js\/unstill_202200668\/","flair":null,"author":"Kind_Negotiation_301","selftext":"If I want to break out…\n\nI have to be unpredictable.................\n\n \n\nI take a slow, measured breath.\n\nI look around.

I’m not posting this for upvotes or attention. I need to get it out—before I forget more than I already have.\n\nThis happened three months ago, but it already feels like it was years. Or maybe last night. Time's been weird lately.\n\nAnyway, I worked the night shift at D.C. Mall. You’ve probably never heard of it unless you're local, and even then, most people forget it exists. It was one of those 1980s architectural corpses—ugly red brick, boxy, and somehow always slightly humid inside, no matter the season. Half the stores were shuttered. Escalators were blocked off with yellow caution tape that had been there long enough to turn gray.\n\nI was hired as a night watch security temp, through some third-party company called Watchtower Facilities. Their logo was this awful pixelated eye with a tower in the middle. Looked like something off a broken CD-ROM. All the training was online—cheap voiceovers, click-through slides, and a bulleted list of \"incident response protocols\" that I never thought I’d actually use.\n\nMy job was simple:\n\n* Show up at 9:45 p.m.\n* Walk the mall loop once an hour\n* Watch the cameras in the security room\n* Lock the loading dock at midnight\n* Leave at 6:00 a.m.\n\nThat was it.\n\nAt first, it was easy money. I brought books, snacks, earbuds. The place was so dead it echoed. I used to take naps in the massage chairs outside the old Brookstone. The only other person I ever saw was the janitor—an old guy named Leon who only spoke in nods and throat-clearings. He cleaned the same spots every night like he was stuck on loop.\n\nBut then the cameras started acting weird.\n\n\\[CAMERA FEED – ZONE 4, NORTH WING – 01:17 A.M.\\] \\[STATIC – NO SIGNAL – RECONNECTING…\\] \\[CAMERA ONLINE\\]\n\nAt first it was just glitches. One camera would cut out for a few seconds, then snap back. Normal, right? But then they started staying out longer. Always the same two zones—Zone 4 and Zone 7.\n\nZone 4 was the North Wing—dead center of the mall. Where the fountain used to be, before they filled it with dirt and fake plants. Zone 7 was the food court. That area always gave me a weird feeling. Too open. Too quiet. Even the air felt... wrong there.\n\nOne night, around 1:00 a.m., I noticed movement on the Zone 7 feed. A figure.\n\nIt walked across the screen—slow, jerky. Like the frame rate was off. I thought it was Leon at first, but the figure was taller. Thinner. Dressed in something long and black. Like an old funeral suit.\n\nBut here’s the thing: it didn’t show up on any other cameras. It crossed the food court, but the moment it reached the next zone, it just vanished. No footsteps. No echo. Nothing.\n\nI checked the feeds, frame by frame. On one, the figure was mid-step. On the next, it was gone. Like the camera blinked.\n\nI did a loop. Took my flashlight. Told myself it was just a glitch.\n\nThe mall was silent.\n\nYou ever walk through a space that feels like it’s remembering something? That’s the only way I can describe it. Like the walls were listening. Like they’d seen something bad.\n\nI got to the food court. All the tables were upside down, chairs stacked. The air smelled like stale fries and mildew.\n\nThen I heard something.\n\nNot footsteps. Not breathing. Something... dragging.\n\nIt was soft. Wet. Like damp cloth being pulled across tile.\n\nI pointed my flashlight toward the back of the Sbarro. That’s where it was coming from. The light hit the counter, then something ducked behind it.\n\nFast.\n\nToo fast.\n\nI don’t know what I expected to see. A raccoon? A homeless guy? Hell, maybe even Leon fucking with me.\n\nI called out. “Hey. You’re not supposed to be here. Mall’s closed.”\n\nNo answer.\n\nJust the dragging sound. Closer now.\n\nI backed away. Tried to radio Leon. No response.\n\nI should have left right then. I should have quit.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nWhen I got back to the security room, all the feeds were static. Just black and white fuzz, like an old TV without signal.\n\nThen—just for a second—I saw something flicker onto the Zone 4 feed.\n\nThe fountain. Except it wasn’t filled with dirt. It was full of water again. Murky, greenish-black.\n\nAnd something was floating in it.\n\nA mannequin. I thought. Had to be. White plastic arms sticking out at weird angles. No face. Just a round, blank head.\n\nThen its head turned.\n\nNot a glitch. Not an illusion. It turned, slowly, like it heard me.\n\nI pulled the plug on the monitors. Sat in the dark for the rest of my shift.\n\nAt 6:00 a.m., the doors unlocked like normal. Sunlight hit the atrium, and the mall looked like it always did—dead, lifeless, beige.\n\nLeon passed me by the exit, nodded like nothing happened. I asked if he saw anything.\n\nHe just said:\n\n“You’ll get used to it.\""},"61":{"title":"Hi guys.\nI’ve got this idea but I’m too lazy and busy to fully work on it, and I don’t want to just forget about it, so I’m throwing it out here to see what you think.

A learned woman, she would join a convent in 1433 when here parents mysteriously died. It was there she would learn to read and write. Elya was Disliked by the other nuns at the convent do to the misfortune and tragedy following her where ever she would go. Several nuns would pass away during the few years of her stay, form sickness and freak accidents. In 1436 secret wright's discussing necromantic rites and rituals were discovered in her possion. She was then tried and executed for witchcraft. Recently archeologists have unloved these writing not only detailing her alleged practices but her life's story as well.  After transcribing the documents I am utterly shocked and horrified by there contense and figured I turn it over to the most qualified experts of all..... the occultists of reddit. \n\nThe Grimoire of Elya of Black Hollow\n\n“Kept by mine own hand, in ink, blood, and ash.”\n(Written in the margins of church hymnals, on scraps of vellum, hidden beneath hearthstones and behind chimney bricks.)\n\nOf the Witch’s Nature\nYou were not born as other girls. The wind stirred when you wailed your first breath. You bear the mark, seen only in candle smoke and the reflection of a black mirror. Know this: a witch is not made—she is remembered. You are mine, and you are Herself.\n\nWitchcraft is not a thing of play. It is blood, bone, breath, and will. It is ancient, older than the Church or the king, and feared because it is free.\n\nThe world will not love you for this path. You must not ask it to. You must only learn and endure.\n\nBook Structure\nThis book will unfold in several handwritten sections, each representing different aspects of Elya’s knowledge and pact.\n\nI. The Black Covenant\nHer pact with the Devil. \n\nII. Charms, Curses, and the Evil Eye\nSpells and spoken charms to curse cattle, wither crops, blight wombs, sicken men, and ruin luck.\n\nIII. Herbs of Shadow and Blood\nHerb and root lore, poisonous and baneful plants, ointments, flying salves, and how to gather by the moon.\n\nIV. Familiars and Spirits\nDescriptions of her spirit companions, how she summoned them, fed them, and used them in workings.\n\nV. Signs and Warnings\nHow to read omens, strange weather, birth defects, black dogs, or stillborn animals as signs from the Devil or spirits.\n\nVI. The Sabbath Rite\nElya’s personal accounts of attending the Witch's Sabbath, including songs, mock masses, rituals, and otherworldly visions.\n\nVII. Tools and Hidden Words\nHow she made her tools—wands, poppets, knives, and spirit bottles—and the secret names and languages she used.\n\nVIII. Death and Devil’s Work\nHow to bring death to men and beasts, cause miscarriages, storms, madness, and rot. Blood magic and graveyard rites.\n\nIX. The Final Oath\nA prophecy or warning at the end\n\n“I renounce God, His Christ, and all His saints. I give myself, body and soul, unto thee, Master. Take me as thy servant and seal our bond.”\n\nThe Covenant of Black Hollow ✠\n\nAs writ in the Devil’s hour, beneath the Gallows Bough, by mine own hand, Elya, daughter of the night.\n\nOn the Night of the Pact\nLet the moon be dark and the air still. Let no bell toll nor cock crow.\n\nAt the hour of midnight, go unto a crossroads, where two roads meet and none dare walk. There, in the shadow of a tree where blood was spilled and prayers denied, make this offering and this oath.\n\nSupplies:\n\nOne black candle of tallow, inscribed with thy secret mark\n\nBlood from thy left breast or finger\n\nParchment of lambskin\n\nGrave earth (from one who died unshriven)\n\nFlying ointment (belladonna, fat of babe, ash of yew, and oil of wormwood)\n\nAn iron needle\n\nA toad’s dried heart or crow’s tongue\n\nThe Circle of Unmaking\nUpon the ground, draw a circle of protection and inversion, thus:\n\nMix pig’s blood, ash, and grave earth into a paste.\n\nInscribe the circle counterclockwise.\n\nMark the four quarters with: toad, black feather, cat’s tooth, and stone from a thunder-struck place.\n\nWithin the circle, light the candle and breathe the fumes of the ointment. Anoint thy brow, breast, and loins.\n\nThe Conjuration\nStand bare and unshod within the circle and speak these words three times:\n\n“I call thee, Artos, Lord of the Crossroads, He who wears the cloven foot, Black Goat of the Sabbat—\nCome forth by bone and blood, by ash and air,\nBy oath broken and bread denied.”\n\nWhen the wind turns and the candle burns blue, He is near.\n\nThe Offering\nPrick thy flesh and bleed upon the parchment. Sign thy name thus:\n\n“I, Elya of Black Hollow, do forswear all baptism, chrism, and churching.\nI cast down cross and creed.\nI give my body, soul, and blood to thee, Master of the Night.”\n\nSeal the parchment with wax and bury it at the foot of the tree.\n\nThen kiss His foot or His form where He bids it, even though it burn thy lips. This is the Osculum.\n\nThe Pact Shall Be Sealed\nHe shall mark thee with a witch’s teat—upon thy thigh, shoulder, or secret place—insensible to blade or fire.\n\nHe shall gift thee:\n\nThe Evil Eye, to curse with a glance.\n\nThe Shape of Beasts—cat, crow, and hare.\n\nPower of Storm and Plague.\n\nA Familiar, in beast or shadow, bound to serve thee.\n\nKnowledge of Poison and Herb, to make draughts and death.\n\nFlight, upon wind or broom, ointment or beast.\n\nAnd He shall whisper thy true Name into thy ear, which none shall know and all shall fear.\n\nThe Sabbath Follows\nCome when He calls, beneath hill or hollow. Bring no holy thing. Dance widdershins. Feast on flesh. Mock the Mass. Learn the deep secrets.\n\nForget not this: all power is bought. One day He will ask His due. Give it freely, lest He take more.\n\nClosing the Circle\nWhen the pact is done, cast salt behind thy shoulder. Snuff the candle with black earth. Depart without looking back.\n\nAnd so it is writ. And so it is bound.\n\n✠ Seal this page in black cloth, speak of it to none, and guard it as thy life. ✠\n\n\n\n\nII. Charms, Curses, and the Evil Eye\n\n“Words are weapons.

Herbs of Shadow and Blood\n“Every leaf hath its demon, every root a whisper.

Familiars and Spirits\n“They come by night, in dream or smoke, to suckle and speak. I call them by name, as they called me.”\n\nOn Familiars\nDefinition: A familiar is a spirit—often clothed in animal shape—that binds itself to the witch to serve her will, deliver her power, and report her deeds to the Devil.\nBinding Rite:\n\nBlooded Milk Offering: Mix milk, your own blood (3 drops), and ashes.

Signs and Warnings\n“The world speaks in cracks and shadows. The wise watch. The fool forgets.”\n\nOn the Reading of Signs\nA true witch reads not only the heavens and herbs, but the twitching of a dog’s ear, the crack in a teacup, the song of a crow. All things speak, in their way. Elya was taught by her familiar to listen to the earth with her feet and the wind with her teeth.\n\n“All things have language—the Devil reads it backwards.”\n\nDaily Omens: What the World Tells\nBird-Sign (Ornithomancy)\nOne crow cawing at dawn: Death draws near.\n\nThree crows circling sunwise: Power is rising. Cast now.\n\nA bird tapping at window: A spirit wants entrance.\n\nWren under the eaves: A child will fall ill.\n\nOwl hooting thrice at dusk: A witch is being named.\n\nElya’s Note:\n\n“Never curse when the owl hoots once—it shall rebound.”\n\nWeather Signs\nSudden wind from the east on a still day: A spell has been cast nearby.\n\nSun haloed in red before setting: A powerful witch is at work.\n\nRain falling while sun shines: Spirits are walking in daylight—best to stay indoors.\n\nLightning without thunder: Devil passing overhead.\n\nHousehold Omens\nBroom falling: Unexpected guest—possibly hostile.\n\nIron nail found in hearth ash: Someone has tried to curse you.\n\nSpoon crossing another in a bowl: Quarrel in the house or spell misfiring.\n\nMilk spilled backward (toward the person): Protection weakened. Ward again.\n\nThe Witch’s Body as Oracle\nElya understood that the body, too, foretells. Pain, twitches, and blood are all signs of spiritual interference or hidden workings.\n\nLeft palm itching: A gift coming.\n\nRight palm itching: Someone takes from you.\n\nThigh pain at night: Familiar feeding.\n\nSudden nosebleed during spellcraft: A spirit answers.\n\nEye twitch (left): Someone curses you.\n\nEye twitch (right): Someone praises or seeks you.\n\nDream-Warnings (Nocturna Visiones)\n“Dreams sent by spirit or Devil feel thick, like honeyed smoke.”\n\nDream of teeth falling: Death in the family\n\nDream of drowning in ink or mud: Spell has backfired\n\nDream of goat staring: Devil is watching\n\nDream of flying, unbidden: A spirit seeks to ride you in sleep\n\nDream of fire eating a house: Curse must be undone before the next full moon\nProtection Against Harmful Dreams:\n\nSleep with iron scissors beneath the pillow\n\nTie a red thread to your big toe\n\nPlace rowan berries under bed and say:\n\n“By root and bone, by moonlight fair,\nLet no spirit ride me there.”\n\nSigns of Cursed Land or Space\nMilk curdles in the open air\n\nNo birdsong, even at dawn\n\nNails rust within hours\n\nBread will not rise\n\nDog refuses to enter\n\nReflection appears wrong in glass or water\n\nTo test land: Prick your finger and drop the blood in a dish of spring water. If it sinks like stone, the land is cursed.\n\nUnnatural Signs – Beware\nShadow moving counter to your body: Spirit possession or death omen\n\nName spoken on the wind with no speaker: You are being summoned\n\nFire flaring blue without cause: Devil near\n\nCandle that gutters and screams: Presence of a spirit not your own\n\nCharm for Seeing the Truth of a Sign:\n“Let the veil part and the meaning speak,\nBy blood, by bone, by branch, I seek.\nIf good, let warmth arise.\nIf ill, let cold touch my eyes.”\n\nSpeak while holding the sign (feather, bone, object) in hand and stare into flame.\n\n\n\nVI. The Sabbath Rites\n“I rode the wind and kissed the hoof, and there I was among them.”\n\nThough many witches walk alone, the old ways speak of coven-magic: the gathering of witches beneath moon and tree, where their power is multiplied, their spirits entwined, and the Devil himself walks among them. These rites are held in secret hollows, moors, and stone circles, known only to those who carry the mark and speak the hidden tongue.\n\nThis chapter records the rites of the coven: their structure, ceremonies, and shared spellcraft—preserved by Elya, who was counted among the Nine of Hollow Oak.\n\n“We fly on stormwind, borne by herb and oath.\nWe gather where the stone is cracked and the earth bleeds.\nHe waits with goat eyes and a crown of shadow.”\n\nPreparation of the Body\nTo attend the Sabbath, the witch must be unseen by God and known to the Devil. Before departure:\n\nAnoint the body with flying ointment:\n\nBelladonna leaf\n\nHenbane seed\n\nMandrake root\n\nPoppy milk\n\nHog’s fat\n\nAsh of unbaptized stillborn\n\nRecite the Unbinding Charm:\n\n“I cast off Christ and cross and kin.\nBy root and claw, I ride within.\nBy the Devil’s mark, I know my name.\nLet Heaven burn, I feel no shame.”\n\nLie on hearthstone or in furrow. Eyes must close. All else comes as dream or shadow-journey.\n\nFlight to the Sabbath\nElya records:\n\n“I flew as hare and smoke. Crooktail ran beside me.\nOver steeple, over stream. No dog howled.\nI passed through air like breath through teeth.”\n\nFamiliars guide the way. The wind may scream, but none shall hear unless they too are marked.\n\nArrival\nThe place of Sabbath is marked by:\n\nA ring of stones or scorched ground\n\nAn old tree bent like a claw\n\nThe smell of burnt feathers, piss, and resin\n\nThe Devil appears: not always horned. Sometimes as a dark man, sometimes goat-shaped, sometimes a child with burning eyes.\n\nThe Greeting\nAll witches must kneel and kiss the Devil. Not on the hand—but:\n\n“On the back, on the hoof, or on the shadowed mouth.\nWherever he turns, kiss without flinch.”\n\nHe may speak true names—hide nothing.\n\nThe Oath of Fealty\nEach witch renews her pact aloud:\n\n“I am thine, and none else’s.\nMy blood for thy wine. My soul for thy fire.\nMark me, take me, use me.\nI shall do harm as thou shall command.”\n\nBlood is drawn from the Devil’s nail or thorned branch and licked or burned into the skin.\n\n\nFeasting and Revel\nWitches dine on:\n\nBlack bread\n\nRoasted crow\n\nBlood pudding\n\nUnblessed wine\n\nFat of hanged men (in dreams or metaphor)\n\nThe feast is strange—some food turns to ash, some to honey. Many see beasts eating at the table, or babies crying under the cloth.\n\nDancing and Union\nAll join in the round dance, widdershins (counterclockwise), hand to paw to wing. Music is heard, though no instrument is seen. Some dances go till dawn—or till madness.\n\nAt the height, some take the Devil as lover. Others are mounted by familiars. All this is spirit-work, a mingling of will, pain, and power.\n\nElya writes:\n\n“He burned and froze me. I saw the roots of stars.\nHe laughed when I wept. I woke with ash on my thighs.”\n\nTraditionally, a full coven numbers thirteen:\n\nTwelve witches, one for each lunar month\n\nOne Devil, spirit, or familiar who presides (called the Black Man, the Goat-Brother, or the Crooked One)\n\nHowever, smaller covens of three, five, seven, or nine are also common. Power grows with number, but intention, blood-tie, and oath are what truly bind a circle.\n\nEach witch may take a role by gift, lineage, or lot:\n\nMother of the Circle – Keeper of rites, midwife of curses, healer\n\nHand of Flame – Leads in calling spirits, bearer of fire\n\nVoice of the Moon – Oracle and chanter of charms\n\nKeeper of the Bone – Tends to dead spirits and ancestors\n\nWatcher at the Crossroads – Guardian, protector, knower of paths\n\nWeaver of Knots – Binder of fate and spells\n\nHag of the Wood – Knower of plants, poisons, and transformations\n\nBride of the Beast – Consort of the Devil in his aspect\n\nWitch of Silence – Keeps secrets and speaks only in ritual\n10–12. Witches-at-Large – Fulfill works as needed\n\nThe Black One – Spirit who guides the circle (sometimes invoked, sometimes embodied by a masked witch)\n\nSabbath Gatherings\nHeld on nights of power:\n\nCandlemas (Imbolc) – For renewal and prophecy\n\nMay Eve (Beltaine) – For fertility, love, and fire\n\nLammas (Lughnasadh) – For sacrifice and harvest magic\n\nAll Hallow’s Eve (Samhain) – For necromancy and pacts with spirits\n\nFull Moons – For healing, flying, visions\n\nNew Moons – For curses, transformations, and devil’s work\n\n\nRites of Oath and Blood\nWhen a new witch is welcomed:\n\nShe is blindfolded and brought to the circle\n\nShe must name three wrongs done to her\n\nShe pricks her finger, spills blood upon the Black Book\n\nThe circle chants:\n\n“Named by none, now named by us.\nMarked by blood, now bound in trust.\nWitch be made, and never undone.”\n\nHer name is burned, her new title given, and the Devil’s mark is sought.\n\nSymbols and Gestures\nThe Sign of Horn and Heel – Made with two fingers up, thumb across palm (warding or summoning)\n\nThe Spiral Dance – Performed widdershins, in trance, to raise power\n\nThe Cackling Chant – Laughter worked as magic, used to disorient or empower\n\nPunishment and Banishment\nIf a witch betrays the coven:\n\nHer name is scraped from the Black Book\n\nHer mark is burned or cut\n\nHer hair is knotted with ash and buried\n\nThe curse is spoken:\n\n“By what you broke, so be broken.\nBy what you gave, now taken.\nGo out, unloved, unbound, unwitch’d.”\n\nRare, but feared.\n\nElya’s Final Word\n“Alone, I burned. With them, I blazed.\nWe flew, we sang, we cursed, we healed.\nAll we did was power. All we were was truth.\nThe world feared what it could not chain.\nSo we danced in the dark, free and laughing.”\n\nThe Satanic Baptism\n“For I am not born of Eve, nor bathed in holy water,\nbut anointed in ash, in blood, and in the Devil’s breath.”\n\nThis rite unbinds a witch from the false God and binds her to the Adversary. It is often performed at the first Sabbath or after the Oath of Blood.\n\nTools Required:\nA basin of blood and black wine\n\nA bone needle or thorn\n\nA black cord (for the naming)\n\nA black candle\n\nAn image of the Horned One (or a masked celebrant)\n\nThe Rite:\nThe candidate is stripped bare, blindfolded, and led to the circle at midnight.\n\nShe is asked three times:\n“Do you renounce the God of men, and all his works?”\nShe answers: “I do.”\n\nHer brow is marked with ash and pig’s blood in the shape of a hoof or inverted cross.\n\nThe celebrant says:\n“Born in shadow, reborn in flame,\nYou are no longer [birth name],\nBut [witch name], daughter of the Night.”\n\nHer new name is whispered into a toad’s ear and released.\n\nShe drinks from the chalice of black wine and blood.\n\n\nThe Black Mass\n“We sing not to the Christ, but to the Serpent.\nWe do not kneel — we dance. We do not beg — we conjure.”\n\nA rite held on high Sabbaths or in mockery of Church feasts (especially Easter and Christmas), the Black Mass is a gathering of power, blasphemy, and ecstasy. It may serve as initiation, celebration, or pact renewal.\n\nSetting:\nHeld at midnight, in a desecrated or ruined place: a defiled chapel, a stone circle, or a burial ground.\n\nThe altar may be a stone, a coffin, or in some traditions, the body of a willing celebrant.\n\nTools:\nA Black Book of chants and reversed prayers\n\nCandles made of fat (human or animal)\n\nHost made from rye bread marked with the Devil’s sigil\n\nWine mixed with gall or menstrual blood\n\nA skull or bone relic\n\nInverted cross or goat’s skull\n\nStructure:\n1. The Inversion\n\nAll symbols of the Church are inverted.\n\nThe mass begins with the chant:\n\n“Credo in Domine Tenebrarum,\nEt in daemonibus eius.”\n(“I believe in the Lord of Darkness, and in His demons.”)\n\n2. The Unholy Host\n\nThe “Host” is raised and mocked.\n\nThe celebrant speaks:\n\n“This is not the body of Christ,\nbut the bread of freedom.\nTake and eat, and be made whole in sin.”\n\n3. Invocation of the Devil\n\nThe Devil is called by many names:\n\n“Lvcifer, Samael, Azazel, Asmodei,\nCome in smoke, come in storm, come in song.”\n\nA familiar or spirit may appear in vision or possession.\n\n4. Offering and Oath\n\nBlood may be offered in a dish.\n\nOaths are renewed:\n\n“My soul is mine, and I give it freely.\nMy flesh is yours, and I keep it gladly.\nWe are bound until time unravels.”\n\n5. The Dance\n\nThe circle ends in ecstatic dance, laughter, flight, or trance.\n\nSome covens report levitation, visions, or carnal union with spirits.\n\nThe Blasphemous Litany\nA common chant sung during such rites:\n\n“Holy is the Serpent, Prince of Light,\nWhose fire frees us from chains.\nWoe to the tyrant on high,\nWho calls freedom sin and knowledge evil.\nWe deny him, we defy him,\nAnd we rise by night in His name.”\n\nPrecautions and Warnings\nThese rites are not for the unblooded or half-hearted.\n\nSpirits may be called that cannot be sent away.\n\nOnce baptized in shadow, the mark lingers in dreams and flesh.\n\nDo not attempt these rites without full knowledge and consent — the Devil bargains well, but does not forgive deceit.\n\nElya’s Warning:\n“We who walk this path do so with open eyes.\nNo light may save us, but we do not seek it.\nWe carry our own flame — black, burning, and holy.”\n\n\n\nThe Great Rite (Union with the Devil)\n\n“He came in shadow, but offered light. He took my name and gave me power. I am no longer theirs. I am His.”\n—Elya of Black Hollow\n\nA secret rite wherein a chosen witch, often the Bride of the Beast, joins bodily or spiritually with the Crooked One.\n\nTakes place at midnight under the black sky\n\nAn altar of black cloth and bone is prepared\n\nA blade is offered, a kiss is given, and oaths are whispered\n\nThrough this rite, the witch may gain visions, familiars, or the Devil’s Gifts (the Eye, the Tongue, the Flight, the Form).\n\nLed by the Hand of Flame and Voice of the Moon, the coven beats staves against the earth, howling the wind’s name.\n\nA cauldron is filled with water, salt, and thorn\n\nFlames are cast in, and breath is blown\n\nChant:\n\n“Wind and fire, sky and sea,\nWe unbind the storm, let it run free!”\n\nOften used to destroy crops, scatter enemies, or veil a working.\n\n\n\n\nThe Working Circle\nSpells cast at Sabbath are stronger. Here are the rites permitted:\n\nBinding an enemy with grave dirt and image\n\nCursing a house by name and blood\n\nCalling storms by whirling a blade in water\n\nSeeing the future in a basin of piss and coal\n\nNaming a new witch with blood and milk on the tongue\n\nShared Spellcraft\nThe Knot of Nine\nA spell woven by nine witches, each tying a knot in black thread, chanting:\n\n“By knot and will, by breath and blood,\nWhat we bind, shall not unbind.\nTill death unmake it, it shall hold.”\n\nUsed for binding enemies, sealin\n\n\"One witch is a flame. Three are a fire. Nine are a storm.”\n—Elya of Black Hollow\n\nDeparting\nTo leave the Sabbath:\n\nKiss the Devil’s mark again.\n\nSpeak your name backward three times.\n\nClose your left eye.\n\nYou will wake in your bed, field, or hearth—sometimes marked, sometimes not.\nSigns You Have Attended Truly\nAsh or soot on feet\n\nBlood at the inner thigh or breast\n\nThe sound of drumming in your ears at dawn\n\nMilk curdling without reason\n\nFire refusing to light\n\nFinal Words from Elya\n“Do not speak of the Sabbath by name in daylight.\nIt is not a dream. It is a place. It remembers.”\n\n\nVII. Tools and Hidden Words\n“A blade in the dark, a word in the bone—thus is the witch’s work done.”\n\nOn the Witch's Tools\nThe tools of craft are not sacred in themselves, but made potent through use, blood, and word. A witch may use a shepherd’s knife, a stolen spoon, or a bone found at crossroads—if bound by rite.\n\n1. The Bladestone (Knife)\nName: Harrowbit\nMaterial: Black iron blade, horn handle\nUse: To cut cords, herbs, spirits; to draw circles; to bleed\nConsecration:\n\nPlunge blade in grave dirt for one full moon\n\nRub with oil of wormwood and blood from left hand\n\nWhisper:\n\n“Cut the veil, drink the breath, silence the name.”\n\n2. The Spirit Bowl\nName: Mother’s Mouth\nMaterial: Clay dish glazed with bone ash\nUse: For offerings, feeding familiars, mixing blood and herb\nKept: Buried under the hearthstone when not in use\nRitual Words When Placing Food for Spirits:\n\n“What is given is taken, what is taken is given. Eat and remember me.”\n\n3. The Staff\nName: Crooked Sister\nMaterial: Rowan wood, bound in black thread\nUse: Walking, flying, stirring storms, commanding familiars\nCharm to Awaken It:\n\n“Twist and rise, by root and sky.\nWalk with me, unseen by eye.”\n\n\n4. The Bone Box\nName: The Holder of Silence\nMaterial: Box made of elderwood, with teeth and bones inside\nUse: To trap a spirit or curse, to store a spell for release\nHow to Bind Something Within:\n\nSpeak the spell or name into the box\n\nPlace a drop of your blood and a token of the target\n\nTie closed with black ribbon\n\nSeal with breath three times and say:\n“Stay here, rot here, work here.”\n\n5. The Ash Mirror\nName: Seeing Shade\nMaterial: Glass smoked black with resin and soot\nUse: Scrying, summoning, reversing spells\nWords to Open the Mirror:\n\n“Show what is hidden, draw what is far,\nLet shadow speak and silence scar.”\n\nElya’s Note:\n\n“Never let the mirror face the window, or it will drink the sky and not give it back.”\n\nOn Hidden Words and Witch-Speech\nWitches speak in riddles, crooked tongue, and the Devil’s tongue writ backward. Hidden words hold power—not only to mask meaning, but to bind spirits, hide curses, and speak truth through smoke.\n\nExamples of Witch-Speech:\n“Red thread on right foot”\n(Protect from hexing while you sleep)\n\n“Milk turns sour before cockcrow”\n(Witch has passed by your threshold)\n\n“The cat blinks thrice”\n(Your spell has taken root in the target)\n\n“Ash in the west wind”\n(A rival witch is watching you)\n\nReversed Charms (Power in Speaking Backwards)\nSpells may be spoken in reverse to break them.\n\n“Tools may rust. Words may fade. But the true power lies in the hand that dares, and the tongue that lies. Keep your craft close. Hide it in plain sight. Speak crooked, write backward. The Devil favors the clever.”\n\nChapter VIII: Death and the Devil’s Work\n“The breath stops, but the road goes on. The grave opens more than earth. There are deeper things than death.”\n—Elya of Black Hollow\n\nOf Death’s Dominion\nTo a witch, death is not final—it is fertile. From death comes:\n\nPower (harvested from spirit, corpse, and bone)\n\nProtection (through pacts with the dead)\n\nProphecy (through communion with spirits)\n\nRevenge (through necromantic arts)\n\nThe Church fears death as an end.\nThe witch knows it is a door.\n\nThe Devil’s Work The Death Oath Rite:\nPrick finger with bone thorn\n\nBleed into black bowl with henbane and ash\n\nSpeak:\n\n“I give breath, bone, and shadow.\nTake what you will, Devil mine.\nTeach me what the dead know.\nLet my name rot from the Church’s book.”\n\nAfter this, the Devil sends a familiar, and the witch gains access to his realm—The Black Vale, The Crooked Field, or The Sabbath World.\n\nTo Bind a Restless Spirit:\nTie poppet of the dead in thread soaked in wine and urine\n\nBury at the foot of their grave with stone atop\n\nSpeak:\n\n“No more walking, no more moan,\nStay in silence, bone to bone.”\n\nTo Raise a Corpse (for Questioning):\nMust be done within 13 nights of death\n\nBurn yew and myrrh\n\nDig shallow trench\n\nPlace coin in the mouth of the skull\n\nChant:\n\n“Ash to ash, but speak once more,\nLet the earth forget its chore.\nOne question, one truth, one toll.”\n\nThe raised dead will answer one truth only, then crumble.\n\n“Death listens. The Devil teaches. But both demand payment.\nDo not call if you do not wish to be heard.\nDo not knock if you do not wish the door opened.\nYet if you must…\nWalk boldly. And bring a bone.”\n\n\nThe Final Oath\n\n“No witch is truly made until she speaks her name before shadow and flame,\nand gives herself over—wholly, willingly, and without the priest’s blessing.”\n—Elya of Black Hollow\n\nWhen the Oath Is Taken\nOn the night of a new moon, when the sky holds no light.\n\nIn the heart of the woods, at a place where three paths cross.\n\nWith a black book, a bone knife, a circle of salt, and blood to sign.\n\nOften taken alone, or witnessed only by the familiar or a Devil's spirit.\n\nThe Preparation\nFast for one day.\nSpeak to no soul for a night and a day.\nWash with spring water and wormwood.\nAnoint the brow with soot and henbane.\nDraw a circle with an iron nail, and mark it with:\n\nThe sign of the Devil (a hoofprint, horned cross, or inverted torch)\n\nThe name you shall be known by in the Devil’s book\n\nA drop of your own blood\n\nThe Oath, Spoken Aloud:\n“I cast off the name given to me by priest and kin.\nI take the name of shadow and secret.\nI bind myself to the Crooked Path,\nTo walk where the moon is dead,\nWhere the trees whisper in tongues,\nWhere the Devil waits in ash and bone.”\n\n“By blood and breath, I give myself.\nMy body shall be his temple,\nMy words his whisper,\nMy will his fire.”\n“I swear to harm as I am harmed,\nTo heal only when I will,\nTo walk unseen,\nTo know the tongues of root, flame, and beast.”\n\n“In return, I ask:\nPower in my hand,\nFire in my breath,\nFlight in the night,\nThe eye that sees beyond the veil.”\n\n“Let no priest undo this vow.\nLet no church cleanse this soul.\nLet no light blind me from the path.”\n\n“By the mark, by the name, by the kiss—I am witch.”\n\nConsequences and Blessings\nGains:\n\nPower over weather, sickness, and shadow\n\nThe Evil Eye\n\nSpirits of service\n\nKnowledge of the herbs of death and life\n\nAccess to the Sabbath and the Devil’s World\n\nResistance to fire, iron, or hexes (in part)\n\nConsequences and Blessings\nGains:\n\nPower over weather, sickness, and shadow\n\nThe Evil Eye\n\nSpirits of service\n\nKnowledge of the herbs of death and life\n\nAccess to the Sabbath and the Devil’s World\n\nResistance to fire, iron, or hexes (in part)\n\n“I was no one. They gave me pain. I gave it form. I shaped it into curse, herb, word, and blade.\nNow I am witch.\nNow I am named.\nNow I am free.”\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd "},"64":{"title":"A knock in the early morning.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jya5b1\/a_knock_in_the_early_morning\/","flair":null,"author":"AnonBaldwin","selftext":"Every night for the past week, exactly at 3:03 AM, someone knocked softly on my front door.

I wasn’t chasing some life-changing experience or trying to prove anything to myself. I just wanted silence.\n\nThe last stretch of road was barely a road at all—just gravel and dirt cutting through miles of dense forest. The trees loomed high, pressed too close together, their trunks disappearing into the early evening mist. The only sign of civilization had been a gas station twenty miles back, where the attendant barely glanced up when I paid.\n\nI was alone. That was the plan.\n\nThe campsite was perfect: a small clearing near a stream, just far enough from the main trail that no one would bother me. I set up my tent quickly, built a small fire, and let myself sink into the quiet. No emails, no calls, no other people. Just me, the cold night air, and the distant sound of water moving over rocks.\n\nI should have felt at peace.\n\nBut something felt off.\n\nThe silence wasn’t *empty*.\n\nIt was watching.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nI woke up sometime after midnight, heart pounding. I didn’t know why.\n\nThe fire had burned down to embers, casting a faint orange glow against the trees. The air was colder than before, heavy and still. I lay there, listening.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nA light.\n\nIt flickered through the thin fabric of my tent, pale and unnatural. For a split second, I thought it was the moon. But it wasn’t moonlight. It moved—erratic, shifting.\n\nIt was coming from the tent next to mine.\n\nBut there *was no tent next to mine*.\n\nI sat up too fast, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew, with absolute certainty, that I was alone. No other campers. No other tents. I had checked.\n\nBut there it was.\n\nAnd someone—or *something*—was inside.\n\nA shadow moved behind the fabric. Slow. Deliberate.\n\nI should have gotten up. Should have unzipped my tent, stepped outside, and demanded to know who was there.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nI lay back down, pulled the sleeping bag up to my chin, and squeezed my eyes shut.\n\nThe light stayed on until dawn.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nMorning should have made it better.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nWhen I unzipped my tent and stepped into the clearing, the second tent was gone.\n\nNo fabric. No poles. No footprints.\n\nJust empty, undisturbed dirt.\n\nI stood there for a long time, my breath fogging in the cold morning air. My mind scrambled for a logical explanation, but none of them made sense. I had seen it. I had watched the light flicker. I had seen *something* move inside.\n\nAnd now, it was like it had never been there at all.\n\nI should have left then. Packed up, hiked back to my car, and driven away without looking back.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nI told myself it had to be a dream, or a trick of the firelight. That I was being paranoid. That I was imagining things.\n\nI spent the day hiking, trying to shake the uneasy feeling clinging to me. The further I went, the quieter the forest became. No birds. No rustling in the underbrush. Just the sound of my own breathing.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nNot an animal. Not the wind.\n\n*Whispering.*\n\nIt was faint, just on the edge of hearing. A dry, papery sound, threading through the trees, curling around my ears.\n\nI didn’t try to understand the words.\n\nI turned back.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nBy the time I made it back to camp, the sun was setting.

Same flickering glow inside.\n\nBut this time, the zipper was partially open.\n\nWaiting.\n\nMy whole body screamed at me to *run*. But I didn’t. I forced myself forward, step by step, until I was close enough to see inside.\n\nThe tent was empty.\n\nNo sleeping bag. No gear. Just the light, hovering in the center like it was suspended in water. It wasn’t a lantern. It wasn’t a flashlight. It was *wrong*.\n\nThe air inside was *colder* than outside.

My arms felt heavy. The air was stale, unmoving.\n\nThe second tent was gone again.\n\nBut something was different.\n\nThe fire pit was cold, like it had been out for days. The trees—*they weren’t the same trees*. They stretched higher, twisted in ways that made my stomach churn. The clearing wasn’t a clearing anymore. The path back to my car was gone.\n\nI wasn’t where I had been.\n\nI grabbed my bag, my phone. The screen was dead. No battery. No way to check the time.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nNot whispering. Not rustling.\n\n*Breathing.*\n\nSlow. Deep. Just outside my tent.\n\nI didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe zipper started to slide down.\n\nSlow.\n\nDeliberate.\n\n# From,\n\n# Mike\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Dear Lorie,\n\nI don’t remember running.\n\nI only remember the endless trees, the dark swallowing me whole, and the whispers—*always whispering*.\n\nI ran until my legs gave out. Until my throat burned. Until I collapsed into the dirt, gasping for air.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw it.\n\nNot the tent.\n\nSomething else.\n\nA shape, standing between the trees. Just beyond the reach of my failing vision. Not moving. Not breathing. Just *watching*.\n\nIt had been watching me since the first night.\n\nIt had been *waiting*.\n\nThe whispers grew louder, curling around my skull, crawling under my skin. My body wasn’t mine anymore.

Not a spoken one, not one whispered between tenants, but a feeling. A cold dread that clung to the chipped porcelain and the tarnished brass fixtures. Amelia, a pragmatic art student, had dismissed the rumors she’d overheard from the building's aging super as fanciful nonsense. “Old pipes, drafty building,” she’d muttered, unpacking her paint supplies.\nThe first few weeks were uneventful. Long soaks after hours spent hunched over canvases were a small luxury. But then, the water started to behave strangely. Sometimes, it would turn icy cold for a few seconds, even with the hot tap running full blast. Other times, faint whispers seemed to rise with the steam, too indistinct to understand. Amelia chalked it up to the building’s eccentric plumbing.\nOne Tuesday evening, after a particularly frustrating painting session, Amelia ran a bath. The water was unusually dark, almost a murky grey, despite the taps running clear. She hesitated, then shrugged. Maybe it was just sediment. As she lowered herself into the tub, the water rippled unnaturally, as if something had brushed against her leg from below. She pulled her legs up, her heart thumping. Nothing.\nShe tried to relax, leaning back against the cold porcelain. The whispers started again, closer this time. She strained to hear, and a single word seemed to detach itself from the hiss of the water: “Mine.”\nAmelia shot up, the water sloshing over the sides. She scrambled out, her skin prickling. The water, now still, looked perfectly normal. She told herself it was stress, exhaustion. She needed sleep.\nThe next night, she avoided the bathtub, opting for a quick shower. But the feeling of being watched, of something lurking just out of sight, persisted. The whispers seemed to follow her, faint and sibilant, even when no water was running.\nThe following evening, a persistent chill permeated the apartment. Amelia, despite herself, felt drawn to the bathroom. The door creaked open on its own as she approached. The bathtub was full, the water a viscous black. This time, there were no whispers, only a heavy silence that pressed against her ears.\nA single, pale hand, its fingers long and skeletal, broke the surface of the water. It didn't reach for her, didn't move at all, just floated there, disturbingly still. Amelia’s breath hitched in her throat. This wasn't faulty plumbing. This was something else entirely.\nShe backed away slowly, her eyes fixed on the hand. As she reached the doorway, the hand submerged, the black water rippling once before becoming perfectly still again.\nAmelia didn’t sleep that night. Every creak of the old building, every gust of wind against the window, sounded like the sloshing of water. The next morning, she packed a bag, intending to stay with a friend.\nAs she passed the bathroom door, she heard a faint gurgling sound. Curiosity, or perhaps a morbid fascination, compelled her to look. The bathtub was empty, save for a single, tarnished brass drain stopper. But etched into the porcelain at the bottom of the tub, as if carved by a ghostly finger, was the word: “Soon.”\nAmelia didn’t go back to Apartment 3B. Her friend let her stay on her couch indefinitely. Months later, she heard through the building grapevine that a new tenant had moved into her old apartment. A young man, eager for a cheap rent in a central location.\nOne rainy Tuesday evening, miles away in her friend’s cozy living room, Amelia felt a sudden, inexplicable chill. She shivered, pulling her blanket tighter. Somewhere in the city, in the echoing silence of Apartment 3B, the claw-footed bathtub was likely filling again. And waiting.\n"},"80":{"title":"I Collect Diaries IV: Ethan Brown","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jsoyei\/i_collect_diaries_iv_ethan_brown\/","flair":null,"author":"Hefty_River_1238","selftext":"My name is Ethan and I’m writing this because my mom doesn’t believe me. I told her I saw a zombie wandering along the beach last night, but she just sighed, ruffled my hair, and told me to stop watching so many horror movies. But I know what I saw.\n\nMy parents and I live on an island far from the cities. They told me it’s part of their job—they’re in charge of taking care of important people’s houses. They didn’t give me many details, just that it was hard work but paid really well. I didn’t agree with moving, but they convinced me with the latest video game console. Who could say no to that?\n\nContrary to what people think, studying at home is boring. I miss my friends. If they were here, at least they’d believe me. We have neighbors, sure, but there aren’t many kids my age. Most of the houses belong to businesspeople and scientists who only visit from time to time.\n\nWe’ve been here for three months. The island is huge, but my parents have forbidden me from going beyond the houses. They say there are dangerous places. They didn’t give any explanations, just threats of punishment if I disobeyed. I did anyway.\n\nGal, our Great Dane, and I ventured a bit farther. We walked along the beach and then took a dirt path that led us to an unfamiliar part of the island. I carried a small flashlight because it was already getting dark. In the distance, I saw some bright lights and metallic structures. I approached carefully and saw a group of people wearing suits like astronauts. I didn’t understand what they were doing. Maybe they were building a rocket? I want to be an astronaut when I grow up, so I watched in fascination.\n\nThese people were going in and out of a strange building. From where I was hiding, I saw them carrying boxes, lots of boxes. I decided to stay for a while, hidden behind some bushes, just to watch. Everything seemed normal until two men ran out of the building toward the ocean.\n\nThat made me nervous. Something wasn’t right. I waited five minutes before leaving, but just as I was about to go, I felt a light vibration in the ground. It wasn’t an earthquake—more like a sudden jolt. Gal started barking for no reason. I didn’t want to risk it, so I decided to head back.\n\nAs I walked home along the beach, I saw it.\n\n\n\nAbout a hundred meters away, a staggering figure was slowly moving. At first I thought it was a drunk man, but when the moonlight hit his face, I felt a chill. His skin was pale, his eyes empty, and he had dark stains on his clothes.\n\n\n\nGal barked loudly. The thing stopped for a second and then began walking toward us.\n\n\n\nI didn’t wait to find out more. I grabbed Gal by the collar and we ran as fast as we could. In the distance, I heard gunshots. I turned for just a second and saw a man with a rifle, shooting the zombie several times until it fell.\n\n\n\nI didn’t stick around to see what happened next. I kept running all the way home and locked myself in my room.\n\n\n\nThis morning I told everything to my mom. She just looked at me patiently and said I need to stop imagining things. She doesn’t believe me.\n\n\n\nBut I know what I saw.\n\n\n\nAnd I know something terrible is happening on this island.\n\n\n\n\/\/\n\n\n\nIt’s been three weeks since I saw the zombie. Mom and Dad have started acting strange—they seem confused. They’re still working normally, but now they wear protective suits when they go out. They told me some kind of toxin had spread across the island, so for safety, they had to go out protected. They’ve forbidden me from leaving. I’ve got my console to play with, but what I saw still terrifies me. What if there are more zombies? I try to distract myself with video games, but the image of that thing staggering along the beach won’t leave me alone. Gal keeps me company, but even he seems uneasy.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, my parents came home. Along with their protective suits, I noticed they brought a lot of food. They said they grabbed everything they could from a nearby store. Dad asked me to store it all in the boat’s pantry. While I did, I noticed something in his expression—not just confusion anymore, but worry.\n\n\n\nBefore bed, I overheard a phone call from my dad. His words weren’t calm.\n\n\n\n“The issue isn’t the money—we did what they told us.” Whoever was on the other end was clearly someone my dad didn’t like.\n\n\n\n“If they don’t tell us what’s going on, we won’t be able to keep working. In the houses, some owners have fallen asleep and haven’t woken up.”\n\n\n\nApparently, my dad didn’t get any response. He hung up the phone forcefully and rubbed his face with his hands, as if trying not to lose control. Mom approached him and they began whispering. I didn’t want to hear any more. I went to my room, with Gal curled up next to my bed, trying to sleep.\n\n\n\nIn the morning, I noticed both my mom and dad had strong colds. Their faces were pale, they looked tired. My dad got up with difficulty, put on his protective suit, and said he had to check something. Before leaving, he checked the magazine of his revolver and holstered it on his belt.\n\n\n\nTwo hours passed. Mom got a call. It was Dad. I don’t know what he said, but Mom became desperate. In a flash, she grabbed my arm, began checking my body, touched my forehead, looked at my arms, and kept asking if I felt sick. I told her no, that I was fine. Then she went to Gal and checked him too. She let out a small sigh of relief.\n\n\n\nAfter that, she called my dad again.\n\n\n\n“What time are you coming back? We’re not leaving without you.”\n\n\n\nI don’t know what he answered, but Mom began crying. Her hand trembled as she held the phone. She handed it to me so I could talk to him.\n\n\n\n“Hey champ, Daddy loves you. Something bad happened. Bad people made mistakes and now others are paying for it. Daddy will do everything he can to fix it. Listen to your mom.”\n\n\n\nThe call cut off. I felt a knot in my throat. I cried. I’d never heard my dad sound so sad. My mom hugged me tight. Afraid, I asked her:\n\n\n\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\n\nMom told me everything. Ever since I saw the zombie, something had changed on the island. They were told that some kind of virus had been released from one of the laboratories. It caused people who got infected to experience strong flu symptoms and extreme drowsiness; they would fall asleep and never wake up. The owners of the houses my parents were looking after had fallen asleep. My parents called their employers, who told them to keep working and even sent them payment in advance. So they did, going out to work wearing those protective suits.\n\n\n\nWhile working, my dad encountered a man walking strangely inside a house. He approached him and noticed the man was missing fingers on one hand. The man attacked him. My dad defended himself, the man fell, got up again, and tried to attack once more. My dad hit him repeatedly, but it didn’t work. Scared, he ran out of the house and locked it behind him. He went to see the island's sheriff to report what had happened.\n\n\n\nThere were about ten police officers on the island, but that afternoon, no one was there. My dad had become friends with a scientist named Jack who lived nearby, and he called him. Jack told him the police were handling an emergency, that the virus was stronger than they thought, that they might evacuate the island or put it under quarantine, and that he should stock up on food just in case.\n\n\n\nMy dad came back from work with my mom. They went to the nearest store, but no one was there. They took everything they could carry. At this point, they were already terrified. They thought everything was going to fall apart.\n\n\n\nWhen they noticed they were sick, my dad called Jack again, but there was no answer. So he went to Jack’s house, telling my mom that if he didn’t return, we should leave.\n\n\n\nJack told him that the virus had actually escaped from the island’s laboratories, that he was trying to create a possible vaccine that could only be synthesized in the island's underground lab. My dad followed him.\n\n\n\nMy dad discovered that the virus spread like the flu, and that we were all probably infected. So he called my mom. She panicked and checked that both Gal and I were okay. We didn’t show any symptoms. My dad was trapped with monsters in the lab, and my mom was infected. She told me it was dangerous for her to stay with me.\n\n\n\nWith her last strength, she managed to get Gal and me onto the boat. She stayed behind on the island. She said that Dad would return and they would join us later. I used to sail with my dad, so I know how to handle the boat. I think I’m doing well. The nights at sea are cold. I miss my parents. Gal is my only companion. I don’t know how much time has passed. The food might last a couple of months. I hope to reach land soon or find another boat. If not, I’m throwing this letter in a bottle. I hope someone finds it. If you see us, please help. Our boat is white with blue stripes.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEthan Brown\n\n\n\nThe  Igea island, that was another place where they experimented with human life.\n\nThe records and information about the place are scarce. Rumors and some notes from scientists found suggest that several experimental vaccines were synthesized there. All communication with the island was lost, so the only way to verify this is in person. Ethan’s message was found a month ago near an observation tower. I checked the radars, but I didn’t find any boat at sea.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Mishasho\n\n"},"81":{"title":"The House","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jslyif\/the_house\/","flair":null,"author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\n\"I had promised myself I’d never go back there.\nSince that night, the house had remained shut, forgotten at the end of the road.\nBut time passed, and its silence turned into dust and cracks in the walls.\nThe real estate agent told me someone was interested in buying it.

Ever since graduating from Juilliard with a degree I couldn't afford and debt I couldn't manage, I found that my classical training was best suited for providing ambiance to those who viewed Bach and Chopin as mere background to their conversations about stock portfolios and vacation homes.\n\nMy name is Everett Carlisle. I am—or was—a pianist for the elite. I've played in penthouses overlooking Central Park, in Hamptons estates with ocean views that stretched to forever, on yachts anchored off the coast of Monaco, and in ballrooms where a single chandelier cost more than what most people make in five years.\n\nI'm writing this because I need to document what happened. I need to convince myself that I didn't imagine it all, though god knows I wish I had. I've been having trouble sleeping. Every time I close my eyes, I see their faces. I hear the sounds. I smell the... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt started three weeks ago with an email from a name I didn't recognize: Thaddeus Wexler. The subject line read \"Exclusive Engagement - Substantial Compensation.\" This wasn't unusual—most of my clients found me through word of mouth or my website, and the wealthy often lead with money as if it's the only language that matters. Usually, they're right.\n\nThe email was brief and formal:\n\n*Mr. Carlisle,*\n\n*Your services have been recommended by a mutual acquaintance for a private gathering of considerable importance. The engagement requires absolute discretion and will be compensated at $25,000 for a single evening's performance. Should you be interested, please respond to confirm your availability for April 18th. A car will collect you at 7 PM sharp. Further details will be provided upon your agreement to our terms.*\n\n*Regards,*\n*Thaddeus Wexler*\n*The Ishtar Society*\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. For one night. I'd played for billionaires who balked at my usual rate of $2,000. This was either a joke or... well, I wasn't sure what else it could be. But curiosity got the better of me, and the balance in my checking account didn't hurt either. I responded the same day.\n\nTo my surprise, I received a call within an hour from a woman who identified herself only as Ms. Harlow. Her voice was crisp, professional, with that particular cadence that comes from years of managing difficult people and situations.\n\n\"Mr. Carlisle, thank you for your prompt response. Mr. Wexler was confident you would be interested in our offer. Before we proceed, I must emphasize the importance of discretion. The event you will be attending is private in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\n\"I understand. I've played for many private events. Confidentiality is standard in my contracts.\"\n\n\"This goes beyond standard confidentiality, Mr. Carlisle. The guests at this gathering value their privacy above all else. You will be required to sign additional agreements, including an NDA with substantial penalties.\"\n\nSomething about her tone made me pause. There was an edge to it, a warning barely contained beneath the professional veneer.\n\n\"What exactly is this event?\" I asked.\n\n\"An annual meeting of The Ishtar Society. It's a... philanthropic organization with a long history. The evening includes dinner, speeches, and a ceremony. Your role is to provide accompaniment throughout.\"\n\n\"What kind of music are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Classical, primarily. We'll provide a specific program closer to the date. Mr. Wexler has requested that you prepare Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, as well as selected pieces by Debussy and Satie.\"\n\nSimple enough requests. Still, something felt off.\n\n\"And the location?\"\n\n\"A private estate in the Hudson Valley. As mentioned, transportation will be provided. You'll be returned to your residence when the evening concludes.\"\n\nI hesitated, but the thought of $25,000—enough to cover six months of my Manhattan rent—pushed me forward.\n\n\"Alright. I'm in.\"\n\n\"Excellent. A courier will deliver paperwork tomorrow. Please sign all documents and return them with the courier. Failure to do so will nullify our arrangement.\"\n\nThe paperwork arrived as promised—a thick manila envelope containing the most extensive non-disclosure agreement I'd ever seen. It went beyond the usual confidentiality clauses to include penalties for even discussing the existence of the event itself. I would forfeit not just my fee but potentially face a lawsuit for damages up to $5 million if I breached any terms.\n\nThere was also a list of instructions:\n\n1. Wear formal black attire (tuxedo, white shirt, black bow tie)\n2. Bring no electronic devices of any kind\n3. Do not speak unless spoken to\n4. Remain at the piano unless instructed otherwise\n5. Play only the music provided in the accompanying program\n6. Do not acknowledge guests unless they acknowledge you first\n\nThe last instruction was underlined: *What happens at the Society remains at the Society.*\n\nThe music program was enclosed as well—a carefully curated selection of melancholy and contemplative pieces. Debussy's \"Clair de Lune,\" Satie's \"Gymnopédies,\" several Chopin nocturnes and preludes, and Bach's \"Goldberg Variations.\" All beautiful pieces, but collectively they created a somber, almost funereal atmosphere.\n\nI should have walked away then. The money was incredible, yes, but everything about this felt wrong. However, like most people facing a financial windfall, I rationalized. Rich people are eccentric. Their parties are often strange, governed by antiquated rules of etiquette. This would just be another night playing for people who saw me as furniture with fingers.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\n---\n\nApril 18th arrived. At precisely 7 PM, a black Suburban with tinted windows pulled up outside my apartment building in Morningside Heights. The driver, a broad-shouldered man with a close-cropped haircut who introduced himself only as Reed, held the door open without a word.\n\nThe vehicle's interior was immaculate, with soft leather seats and a glass partition separating me from the driver. On the seat beside me was a small box with a card that read, \"Please put this on before we reach our destination.\" Inside was a black blindfold made of heavy silk.\n\nThis was crossing a line. \"Excuse me,\" I called to the driver. \"I wasn't informed about a blindfold.\"\n\nThe partition lowered slightly. \"Mr. Wexler's instructions, sir. Security protocols. I can return you to your residence if you prefer, but the engagement would be canceled.\"\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. I put on the blindfold.\n\nWe drove for what felt like two hours, though I couldn't be certain. The roads eventually became less smooth—we were no longer on a highway but winding through what I assumed were rural roads. Finally, the vehicle slowed and came to a stop. I heard gravel crunching beneath tires, then silence as the engine was turned off.\n\n\"We've arrived, Mr. Carlisle. You may remove the blindfold now.\"\n\nI blinked as my eyes adjusted to the fading daylight. Before me stood what could only be described as a mansion, though that word seemed insufficient. It was a sprawling stone structure that looked like it belonged in the English countryside rather than upstate New York. Gothic in design, with towering spires and large windows that reflected the sunset in hues of orange and red. The grounds were immaculate—perfectly manicured gardens, stone fountains, and pathways lined with unlit torches.\n\nReed escorted me to a side entrance, where we were met by a slender woman in a black dress. Her hair was pulled back so tightly it seemed to stretch her pale skin.\n\n\"Mr. Carlisle. I'm Ms. Harlow. We spoke on the phone.\" Her handshake was brief and cold. \"The guests will begin arriving shortly. I'll show you to the ballroom where you'll be performing.\"\n\nWe walked through service corridors, avoiding what I assumed were the main halls of the house. The decor was old money—oil paintings in gilt frames, antique furniture, Persian rugs on hardwood floors. Everything spoke of wealth accumulated over generations.\n\nThe ballroom was vast, with a ceiling that rose at least thirty feet, adorned with elaborate plasterwork and a chandelier that must have held a hundred bulbs. At one end was a raised platform where a gleaming black Steinway grand piano waited. The room was otherwise empty, though dozens of round tables with black tablecloths had been arranged across the polished floor, each set with fine china, crystal, and silver.\n\n\"You'll play from here,\" Ms. Harlow said, leading me to the piano. \"The program is on the stand. Please familiarize yourself with the sequence. Timing is important this evening.\"\n\nI looked at the program again. It was the same selection I'd been practicing, but now each piece had specific timing noted beside it. The Chopin Nocturne was marked for 9:45 PM, with \"CRITICAL\" written in red beside it.\n\n\"What happens at 9:45?\" I asked.\n\nMs. Harlow's expression didn't change. \"The ceremony begins. Mr. Wexler will signal you.\" She checked her watch. \"It's 7:30 now. Guests will begin arriving at 8. There's water on the side table. Please help yourself, but I must remind you not to leave the piano area under any circumstances once the first guest arrives.\"\n\n\"What if I need to use the restroom?\"\n\n\"Use it now. Once you're at the piano, you remain there until the evening concludes.\"\n\n\"How long will that be?\"\n\n\"Until it's over.\" Her tone made it clear that was all the information I would receive. \"One final thing, Mr. Carlisle. No matter what you see or hear tonight, you are to continue playing. Do not stop until Mr. Wexler indicates the evening has concluded. Is that clear?\"\n\nA chill ran through me. \"What exactly am I going to see or hear?\"\n\nHer eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw something like pity. \"The Ishtar Society has traditions that may seem... unusual to outsiders. Your job is to play, not to understand. Remember that, and you'll leave with your fee and without complications.\"\n\nWith that cryptic warning, she left me alone in the massive room.\n\nI sat at the piano, testing the keys. The instrument was perfectly tuned, responsive in a way that only comes from regular maintenance by master technicians. Under different circumstances, I would have been thrilled to play such a fine piano.\n\nOver the next half hour, staff began to enter—servers in formal attire, security personnel positioned discreetly around the perimeter, and technicians adjusting lighting. No one spoke to me or even looked in my direction.\n\nAt precisely 8 PM, the main doors opened, and the first guests began to arrive.\n\nThey entered in pairs and small groups, all impeccably dressed in formal evening wear. The men in tailored tuxedos, the women in gowns that likely cost more than most cars. But what struck me immediately was how they moved—with a practiced grace that seemed almost choreographed, and with expressions that betrayed neither joy nor anticipation, but something closer to solemn reverence.\n\nI began to play as instructed, starting with Bach's \"Goldberg Variations.\" The acoustics in the room were perfect, the notes resonating clearly throughout the space. As I played, I observed the guests. They were uniformly affluent, but diverse in age and ethnicity. Some I recognized—a tech billionaire known for his controversial data mining practices, a former cabinet secretary who'd left politics for private equity, the heiress to a pharmaceutical fortune, a film director whose work had grown increasingly disturbing over the years.\n\nThey mingled with practiced smiles that never reached their eyes. Servers circulated with champagne and hors d'oeuvres, but I noticed that many guests barely touched either. There was an air of anticipation, of waiting.\n\nAt 8:30, a hush fell over the room as a tall, silver-haired man entered. Even from a distance, his presence commanded attention. This, I assumed, was Thaddeus Wexler. He moved through the crowd, accepting deferential nods and brief handshakes. He didn't smile either.\n\nDinner was served at precisely 8:45, just as I transitioned to Debussy. The conversation during the meal was subdued, lacking the usual animated chatter of high-society gatherings. These people weren't here to network or be seen. They were here for something else.\n\nAt 9:30, as I began Satie's first \"Gymnopédie,\" the doors opened again. A new group entered, but these were not guests. They were... different.\n\nAbout twenty people filed in, escorted by security personnel. They were dressed in simple white clothing—loose pants and tunics that looked almost medical. They moved uncertainly, some stumbling slightly. Their expressions ranged from confusion to mild fear. Most notably, they looked... ordinary. Not wealthy. Not polished. Regular people who seemed completely out of place in this setting.\n\nThe guests watched their entrance with an intensity that made my fingers falter on the keys. I quickly recovered, forcing myself to focus on the music rather than the bizarre scene unfolding before me.\n\nThe newcomers were led to the center of the room, where they stood in a loose cluster, looking around with increasing unease. Some attempted to speak to their escorts but were met with stony silence.\n\nAt 9:43, Thaddeus Wexler rose from his seat at the central table. The room fell completely silent except for my playing. He raised a crystal glass filled with dark red liquid.\n\n\"Friends,\" his voice was deep, resonant. \"We gather once more in service to the Great Balance. For prosperity, there must be sacrifice. For abundance, there must be scarcity. For us to rise, others must fall. It has always been so. It will always be so.\"\n\nThe guests raised their glasses in unison. \"To the Balance,\" they intoned.\n\nWexler turned to face the group in white. \"You have been chosen to serve a purpose greater than yourselves. Your sacrifice sustains our world. For this, we are grateful.\"\n\nI was now playing Chopin's Nocturne, the piece marked \"CRITICAL\" on my program. My hands moved automatically while my mind raced to understand what was happening. Sacrifice? What did that mean?\n\nOne of the people in white, a middle-aged man with thinning hair, stepped forward. \"You said this was about a job opportunity. You said—\"\n\nA security guard moved swiftly, pressing something to the man's neck that made him crumple to his knees, gasping.\n\nWexler continued as if there had been no interruption. \"Tonight, we renew our covenant. Tonight, we ensure another year of prosperity.\"\n\nAs the Nocturne reached its middle section, the mood in the room shifted palpably. The guests rose from their tables and formed a circle around the confused group in white. Each guest produced a small obsidian knife from inside their formal wear.\n\nMy blood ran cold, but I kept playing. Ms. Harlow's words echoed in my mind: *No matter what you see or hear tonight, you are to continue playing.*\n\n\"Begin,\" Wexler commanded.\n\nWhat happened next will haunt me until my dying day. The guests moved forward in unison, each selecting one of the people in white. There was a moment of confused struggle before the guards restrained the victims. Then, with practiced precision, each guest made a small cut on their chosen victim's forearm, collecting drops of blood in their crystal glasses.\n\nThis wasn't a massacre as I had initially feared—it was something more ritualized, more controlled, but no less disturbing. The people in white were being used in some sort of blood ritual, their fear and confusion providing a stark contrast to the methodical actions of the wealthy guests.\n\nAfter collecting the blood, the guests returned to the circle, raising their glasses once more.\n\n\"With this offering, we bind our fortunes,\" Wexler intoned. \"With their essence, we ensure our ascension.\"\n\nThe guests drank from their glasses. All of them. They drank the blood of strangers as casually as one might sip champagne.\n\nI felt bile rise in my throat but forced myself to continue playing. The Nocturne transitioned to its final section, my fingers trembling slightly on the keys.\n\nThe people in white were led away, looking dazed and frightened. I noticed something else—small bandages on their arms, suggesting this wasn't the first \"collection\" they had endured.\n\nAs the last notes of the Nocturne faded, Wexler turned to face me directly for the first time. His eyes were dark, calculating. He gave a small nod, and I moved on to the next piece as instructed.\n\nThe remainder of the evening proceeded with a surreal normalcy. The guests resumed their seats, dessert was served, and conversation gradually returned, though it remained subdued. No one mentioned what had just occurred. No one seemed disturbed by it. It was as if they had simply performed a routine business transaction rather than participated in a blood ritual.\n\nI played mechanically, my mind racing. Who were those people in white? Where had they come from? What happened to them after they were led away? The questions pounded in my head in rhythm with the music.\n\nAt 11:30, Wexler rose again. \"The covenant is renewed. Our path is secured for another year. May prosperity continue to flow to those who understand its true cost.\"\n\nThe guests applauded politely, then began to depart in the same orderly fashion they had arrived. Within thirty minutes, only Wexler, Ms. Harlow, and a few staff remained in the ballroom.\n\nWexler approached the piano as I finished the final piece on the program.\n\n\"Excellent performance, Mr. Carlisle. Your reputation is well-deserved.\" His voice was smooth, cultured.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I managed, struggling to keep my expression neutral. \"May I ask what I just witnessed?\"\n\nA slight smile curved his lips. \"You witnessed nothing, Mr. Carlisle. That was our arrangement. You played beautifully, and now you will return home, twenty-five thousand dollars richer, with nothing but the memory of providing music for an exclusive gathering.\"\n\n\"Those people—\"\n\n\"Are participating in a medical trial,\" he interrupted smoothly. \"Quite voluntarily, I assure you. They're compensated generously for their... contributions. Much as you are for yours.\"\n\nI didn't believe him. Couldn't believe him. But I also understood the implicit threat in his words. I had signed their documents. I had agreed to their terms.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"I was merely curious about the unusual ceremony.\"\n\n\"Curiosity is natural,\" Wexler replied. \"Acting on it would be unwise. I trust you understand the difference.\"\n\nMs. Harlow appeared at his side, holding an envelope. \"Your payment, Mr. Carlisle, as agreed. The car is waiting to take you back to the city.\"\n\nI took the envelope, feeling its substantial weight. \"Thank you for the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we'll call on you again,\" Wexler said, though his tone made it clear this was unlikely. \"Remember our terms, Mr. Carlisle. What happens at the Society—\"\n\n\"Remains at the Society,\" I finished.\n\n\"Indeed. Good night.\"\n\nReed was waiting by the same black Suburban. Once again, I was asked to don the blindfold for the return journey. As we drove through the night, I clutched the envelope containing my fee and tried to process what I had witnessed.\n\nIt wasn't until I was back in my apartment, counting the stacks of hundred-dollar bills, that the full impact hit me. I ran to the bathroom and vomited until there was nothing left.\n\nTwenty-five thousand dollars. The price of my silence. The cost of my complicity.\n\nI've spent the past three weeks trying to convince myself that there was a reasonable explanation for what I saw. That Wexler was telling the truth about medical trials. That the whole thing was some elaborate performance art for the jaded ultra-wealthy.\n\nBut I know better. Those people in white weren't volunteers. Their confusion and fear were genuine. And the way the guests consumed their blood with such reverence, such practiced ease... this wasn't their first \"ceremony.\"\n\nI've tried researching The Ishtar Society, but found nothing. Not a mention, not a whisper. As if it doesn't exist. I've considered going to the police, but what would I tell them? That I witnessed rich people drinking a few drops of blood in a ritual? Without evidence, without even being able to say where this mansion was located, who would believe me?\n\nAnd then there's the NDA. Five million dollars in penalties. They would ruin me. And based on what I saw, financial ruin might be the least of my concerns if I crossed them.\n\nSo I've remained silent. Until now. Writing this down is a risk, but I need to document what happened before I convince myself it was all a dream.\n\nLast night, I received another email:\n\n*Mr. Carlisle,*\n\n*Your services are requested for our Winter Solstice gathering on December 21st. The compensation will be doubled for your return engagement. A car will collect you at 7 PM.*\n\n*The Society was pleased with your performance and discretion.*\n\n*Regards,*\n*Thaddeus Wexler*\n*The Ishtar Society*\n\nFifty thousand dollars. For one night of playing piano while the elite perform their blood rituals.\n\nI should delete the email. I should move apartments, change my name, disappear.\n\nBut fifty thousand dollars...\n\nAnd a part of me, a dark, curious part I never knew existed, wants to go back. To understand what I witnessed. To know what happens to those people in white after they're led away. To learn what the \"Great Balance\" truly means.\n\nI have until December to decide. Until then, I'll keep playing at regular society parties, providing background music for the merely wealthy rather than the obscenely powerful. I'll smile and nod and pretend I'm just a pianist, nothing more.\n\nBut every time I close my eyes, I see Wexler raising his glass. I hear his words about sacrifice and balance. And I wonder—how many others have been in my position? How many witnessed the ceremony and chose money over morality? How many returned for a second performance?\n\nAnd most troubling of all: if I do go back, will I ever be allowed to leave again?\n\nThe winter solstice is approaching. I have a decision to make. The Ishtar Society is waiting for my answer."},"84":{"title":"Lights Out","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jsieqk\/lights_out\/","flair":null,"author":"fallenArcanum","selftext":"Here's an existential horror story for you: \n\nImagine you've had a bit of a rough start to life. I'm sure, for the lucky few who landed over here, that isn't too far of a stretch. \n\nThough despite the many odds stacked against you, the many voices prattling in your ear, at some point by your mid-twenties, you start getting it together- establishing something almost like a real sense of who you are. \n\nSure, you're carrying most of the weight sometimes, you are a package deal after all. You and the 30-something stowaways living in your head. \nBut you find a balance, a rhythm, you build a life for yourself, one where you feel seen for who you are, and there's space for everyone.  \n\nAnd then, lights out. \n\nYou're a prisoner in your own mind, and someone else is at the wheel, someone you never made the time to learn to trust. Someone you in fact- don't entirely trust. \nThey're an unwilling participant in your replacement. \n\nYou have no choice, you've become a voice in someone else's head for a change, in the farthest, darkest corner in the back, where you're less a voice, and more a whisper. The others help you to your feet as much as they can, and send you up the path, back toward the light, at the front.\n\nA month has passed and the lights have come back on, there are a few fires to put out, the world hasn't ended- though you feel closer to it than comfort, your unwilling replacement has managed to keep your life mostly together, in fact, they've surprised you- they live a little differently than you did. They're softer, sweeter. Nothing like what you would've expected from a scream at the back of your mind.  You must give credit where credit is due. People have been asking for you though, so you think: I can rebuild from here.\n\nAnd then, lights out. \n\nThis time, after your eyes adjust, you think: \"clearly this is a matter of inner light. Something needs to be repaired, within myself.\" You devote the time you're stuck in the dark, to try and understand where your own darkness comes from. You're not a whisper anymore, hardly a breath, so you try and find the light within yourself. It's hard to say whether you do or don't, but the lights come back on by themselves eventually, you cautiously step into it.\n\nAnother month has passed, this time the passage of time doesn't feel quite real, it sort of blends at the edge. So much has changed in the life you built, you find that you're disoriented stepping into your old role. Your replacement has stepped into that role themself, all too comfortably, and your new surroundings reflect that, so it's going to take some work to re-establish your footing. People are surprised to hear from you, but happy nonetheless. You make light out of the situation, to help search for traces of what used to be yours. You want to be sure of what you still have- and what you haven't lost in the dark. \n\nAnd then, lights out.\n\nIt's a hopeless sort of darkness now, nobody left inside has any motivation or belief, god knows that you don't. You aren't a whisper or a breath or anything at all.\nYou use the dark as what it's intended for, and close your eyes. \n\nThis time, when waking into the life you've built, time has lost almost all meaning. Months have passed, and nothing is as you left it. You can hardly recognise your surroundings, much less yourself, They've stopped asking about you, by the way. They don't mean any harm, they've simply forgotten.\nYes, you're basically a fun party trick. The way you're plucked from dream to reality. Where are the lines? Where are the boundaries you set? What still matters when you've disappeared- but nobody cares, because your body still lives and breathes beside them? You aren't sure what's left to do... Aside from drowning your sorrows, covering your eyes, and waiting for the next- \n\nLights out."},"86":{"title":"I Took a Job as a Test Subject.

That was the only reason I agreed to it. I needed the money, and it sounded simple enough—observe, report, document any changes in perception or cognition. Two weeks in a controlled environment. A harmless study.\n\nThe facility was a squat, gray building on the outskirts of town, the kind of place you’d never notice unless you were looking for it. The contract was thick, full of jargon and clauses that I skimmed over before signing. The woman who gave me the papers—Dr. Monroe, I think her name was—had a tight-lipped smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.\n\n“The process is completely safe,” she assured me. “You may experience some minor distortions in sensory perception, but that’s expected.”\n\nI didn’t ask what she meant. I should have.\n\nThey took my phone, my watch, anything that could track time. Then they led me to a small, windowless room with sterile white walls, a single bed, a desk, and a mirror bolted to the wall. I knew from past studies that the mirror was one-way glass. Someone was watching me. I told myself it didn’t matter.\n\nFor the first few hours, nothing happened. They gave me food—plain, flavorless, but edible. The lights never dimmed, so I had no real way of knowing when night fell. A voice over an intercom instructed me to document any changes in perception. I wrote: “Nothing yet.”\n\nI don’t know when I fell asleep. The next thing I remember is waking up to the sound of something moving in the room.\n\nI sat up, heart hammering, but I was alone. The door was still locked, the mirror reflecting my own wide-eyed face. I took a breath, told myself it was my imagination. Maybe I’d kicked the bed in my sleep.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nMy reflection hadn’t moved.\n\nI was sitting upright, breathing heavily, but the me in the mirror was still lying down, eyes shut.\n\nI scrambled off the bed, my pulse roaring in my ears. My reflection stayed where it was for a second longer before it jolted upright, as if catching up to me.\n\nI backed away until I hit the far wall. My reflection did the same.\n\nThe intercom crackled. “Please describe any changes in perception.”\n\nMy mouth was dry. My hands were shaking. I forced myself to breathe, to think.\n\n“It lagged,” I finally said. “My reflection. It didn’t move when I did.”\n\nSilence. Then the intercom clicked off.\n\nI stared at the mirror, half expecting my reflection to move on its own again. It didn’t. It looked normal now. Maybe I imagined it. Maybe it was exhaustion.\n\nI turned away, climbed back into bed. The sheets felt cold, almost damp. I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the sensation that I wasn’t alone in the room.\n\nThat was the first night.\n\nI should have left then.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. How could I? Every movement felt unnatural, my own body betraying me in the dim light of the small room. I tried convincing myself it was fatigue, paranoia, or a trick of the light. But I wasn’t stupid. Shadows don’t move on their own.\n\nAt some point, exhaustion won. I woke up to a room bathed in artificial white. The overhead light never turned off, and I had no sense of time. My mouth was dry. The air hummed with a low, constant vibration I hadn’t noticed before.\n\nI sat up and stared at the floor. My shadow was still there, still mine. But something was off.\n\nIt was breathing.\n\nNo, not breathing exactly. But expanding, contracting, shifting in a way that had nothing to do with me. My pulse hammered in my throat. I lifted a hand. It followed—but that half-second lag was worse now. Deliberate.\n\nThe intercom clicked. \"Describe your shadow.\"\n\nMy voice came out hoarse. \"It’s wrong. It’s—it’s slower than before. It’s moving by itself.\"\n\nA pause. Then: \"Do not be alarmed. This is a normal response.\"\n\n\"Normal?\" I snapped. \"What the hell kind of study is this? What did you do to me?\"\n\nSilence. Then, the door unlocked with a soft click.\n\nI stood, my body tense. No one entered. No instructions followed. Just an open door, yawning like a trap.\n\nI stepped forward. My shadow didn’t move.\n\nI ran.\n\nThe hallway was empty. No scientists, no security—just me and the steady hum of unseen machinery. The overhead lights buzzed, casting long, sterile pools of brightness against the cold floor.\n\nI glanced down. My shadow hadn’t followed.\n\nIt still lay in my room, frozen against the floor like a discarded thing. My stomach twisted. That wasn’t how shadows worked.\n\nA flickering movement at the edge of my vision made me spin. Down the hall, a shadow pooled unnaturally, stretching along the wall in a way that ignored the angles of the light. It wasn’t mine.\n\nI walked faster. Then faster still. Every door I passed looked the same—windowless, unmarked. Was anyone else in here? Had there been other test subjects?\n\nA voice crackled over the intercom. “Return to your room.”\n\nI ignored it.\n\n“Return to your room.”\n\nThe air shifted—something behind me. I turned, but nothing was there. My chest tightened. My feet moved on instinct. Faster. I needed to get out.\n\nA door at the end of the hall had a red exit sign above it. My heart leapt. I ran, my breath loud in my ears. But as I reached for the handle, the hallway lights flickered.\n\nAnd my shadow slammed into me.\n\nI felt it. Cold. Solid. Like a second skin wrapping around my body. I gasped, stumbling backward. My limbs stiffened, and for one horrible second, I wasn’t in control. My arms twitched—moved in ways I hadn’t willed.\n\nThen, it let go.\n\nI collapsed to my knees, sucking in air. My shadow—if it was still mine—was back where it belonged, stretched thin beneath me. But something was different.\n\nIt wasn’t lagging anymore.\n\nIt was leading.\n\nThe intercom buzzed again, softer this time. “You’ve progressed to the next phase.”\n\nI swallowed hard. My fingers curled against the cold floor.\n\nI had a feeling I wasn’t the one being studied anymore.\n\nI sat there, my palms pressing against the icy floor, trying to steady my breath. My shadow was still. But it didn’t feel like mine anymore.\n\nThe intercom crackled again. “You are experiencing a temporary adjustment period. Do not be alarmed.”\n\n“Adjustment?” My voice was raw. “What the hell is happening to me?”\n\nSilence.\n\nI turned back toward the exit. The door was still there, but now, something about it felt off. The edges blurred, like heat waves distorting the air. I reached out, fingers brushing the metal handle—\n\nThe hallway flickered.\n\nNot the lights. The space itself.\n\nFor a split second, I wasn’t in the hallway. I was somewhere else. A darker place, where walls pulsed like living things and shadows slithered unnaturally across the floor.\n\nThen it was gone. I was back in the hallway, the exit door solid beneath my hand.\n\nI stumbled away from it, chest heaving. My shadow rippled beneath me, as if it had seen what I had.\n\n“Return to your room.” The voice was softer now. Almost… coaxing.\n\nI shook my head. “No. I’m leaving.”\n\nThe moment I said it, the lights overhead flared, casting my shadow long and sharp against the floor. It twitched. Shifted.\n\nThen it rose.\n\nI scrambled back as my own darkness peeled itself away, standing upright in front of me. It had my shape, my outline—but it wasn’t *me*. The head tilted, mimicking the way I moved, but with an eerie delay.\n\nMy pulse pounded.\n\nThe shadow took a step forward.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nThe hallway stretched longer than it should have, like I was running through a nightmare where the exit never came closer. My breath hitched. My legs ached. I dared a glance over my shoulder—\n\nIt was following. Fast.\n\nI reached another door—any door—and yanked it open. I threw myself inside, slamming it behind me. My hands fumbled for a lock, but there was none.\n\nThe room was dark, the air thick with something stale and wrong. I turned—\n\nAnd froze.\n\nI wasn’t alone.\n\nShapes loomed in the darkness. Shadows. Some standing. Some crouched. All shifting unnaturally.\n\nI backed against the door, my breath coming in short gasps.\n\nThe intercom crackled once more, but this time, the voice had changed. It was layered, as if more than one person—*or thing*—was speaking at once.\n\n“You were never meant to leave.\"\n\n"},"88":{"title":"UNSTILL. \/\/ 4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jqhei3\/unstill_4\/","flair":null,"author":"Kind_Negotiation_301","selftext":"I check my phone again. 8:48 AM.

Replaced with my normal inbox.\n\nMy hands tighten into fists.\n\nIt’s erasing him.\n\nBefore I can react, my coworker—David—turns to me with a smile.\n\n“Hey,” he says, voice too light. “You’re looking a little stressed. You okay?”\n\nI stare at him. David never talks to me.\n\nNever.\n\n“Yeah,” I say slowly. “Just tired.”\n\nHe nods, his smile not quite right. “You should get some rest. You work too hard.”\n\nI don’t answer.\n\nHis smile lingers a second too long.\n\nThen he turns back to his screen like nothing happened.\n\nI don’t move. I barely breathe.\n\n\"shit...It’s watching me\".\n\nI sighed.\n\nLunchtime. The office empties out as people head downstairs. I stay at my desk, pretending to work. My fingers hover over the keyboard, my mind racing.\n\n202200668 fought back. He tried everything. But he gave up after a week.\n\nI won’t.\n\nI reach for my phone to check my notes—\n\nStatic.\n\nA low, droning noise fills the office. My ears ring. My vision blurs.\n\nI grip the edge of my desk, trying to steady myself. The sound is inside my head.\n\nThen, faintly—beneath the static—\n\nA voice.\n\nNot from any direction. Not from the speakers. Inside my skull.\n\nＳĪ̶̡͖̻̪̘̦̜͖̒͑̄̍͆͛̈́̚͝Ṫ̵̞̩͎̯̖̬͎̹̝̊̐̏͑͛͗̍̚͘̚ ̷̪̻̻̘͇̜̹̏̊̅̀̾̎̎̏̿̈́̕͜Ṡ̷̡̤͕̦͖̲͊̄̔͋͐̄̑͘̚͜͜T̸̜̘̪͕̜̻̻̼̜͎͌̿̔̏̍̽̀̚̚͠Ȉ̵̺̳͚̯̞̓̍̊̑̋̈́̎̍͒L̷̡̰̹̲̥̩̝̉̒̊̽̄͒̏̋̃̄̿͜L̸̡̻̼̪̲͇̈́̈́̎͊̿̽͗̀̅͝.̴̰̙͙̝̖̬̒͛̈́̓͆̇̎̇͋͠\n\nI snap up, heart hammering.\n\nThe static stops.\n\nThe office is normal again.\n\nPeople are talking. Phones are ringing.\n\nBut my hands are ice cold.\n\n \n\n**Later in the afternoon…**\n\n \n\nI reach the coffee shop window—the same one from this morning.\n\nMy hands tremble as I take a slow breath, preparing myself.\n\nI have to look.\n\nI stare into the glass, letting the reflection settle.\n\nThe city behind me is perfect. The cars move in flawless synchronization, the pedestrians glide past without hesitation. Nothing is out of place.\n\nBut beyond it—past the reflection—\n\nI see the house.\n\nThe gray horizon.\n\nAnd this time, he’s not sitting.\n\nHe’s running.\n\nMy stomach lurches.\n\n202200668, the man who once sat in defiance for an eternity, is unstill now.... he is moving again.\n\nHis body moves with a frantic, desperate energy—sprinting toward the endless horizon, his breaths ragged, his arms pumping. He is trying to escape.\n\nI watch, frozen, as he keeps running, keeps trying.\n\nBut I already know how this ends.\n\nHe won’t make it. He never did.\n\nEventually, he will stop.\n\nHe will sit.\n\nAnd he will wait for eternity.\n\nThinking for a moment my throat tightens. This isn’t just a glitch—this is something worse.\n\n“This…. is the past.”\n\nThe reflection is showing me what happened before he gave up.\n\nThe moment that led him to become part of the stillness.\n\nI spin around—but the city is normal. No house. No empty void. Just the bright, noisy streets, full of people who don’t know they aren’t real.\n\nI look back at the reflection—\n\nHe’s still there. Still running.\n\nMy breath catches. I am watching history repeat itself.\n\nAnd I realize something terrifying.\n\nIf I don’t break the cycle—one day, someone else will be watching me.\n\n\\-----------\n\nI can’t move.\n\nI watch the reflection as he keeps running. His movements are frantic, desperate—but his face… his body… they don’t show any signs of exhaustion.\n\nNo gasping. No slowing down.\n\nBecause he can’t feel tired.\n\nThe realization sends a chill up my spine.\n\nHis arms pump, his legs move, his body performs the actions of struggle. But there’s no cost. No burning lungs, no aching muscles. Just motion.\n\nMotion without meaning.\n\nI know how this ends.\n\nAt some point, he will stop. Not because he’s exhausted—because he realizes it doesn’t matter.\n\nAnd then he will sit.\n\nAnd once he sits, he will never move again.\n\nI feel sick.\n\nI’m not watching a man fight for his life. I’m watching the exact moment he realizes he never had a chance.\n\nThe system wants me to see this.\n\nBut why?\n\nI scan the reflection, trying to focus—not on him, but on everything else.\n\nThere has to be something.\n\nA flaw. A crack. A mistake.\n\nHow did he fail?\n\nMy fingers tighten into fists. I stare at the pattern of his running. The way he moves. The way he chooses his direction.\n\nAnd then…\n\nI see it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nInstinct. The most human response. When we escape, we run away.\n\nBut what if that’s the trap?\n\nWhat if this place.... this purgatory.... is designed to absorb forward motion?\n\nWhat if the only way out isn’t to run away—but to move in a way it doesn’t expect?\n\nA sharp breath shudders through me.\n\nThe purgatory thrives on patterns. Routine. Repetition. Even rebellion is something it has prepared for.\n\n202200668 fought—but he fought the way it expected him to.\n\nAnd that’s why he failed.\n\nI look down at my shaking hands.\n\nIf I want to break out…\n\nI have to be unpredictable.\n\n\\-T̵h̷e̸ ̵c̶y̶c̶l̶e̴ ̷i̶s̶n̸’t̴ ̷o̸v̴e̸r ̷y̵e̷t.  \nI̸f̸ ̶I̶ ̷d̸o̴n̶’̷t̸ ̴m̸o̴v̸e̷ ̴a̷t̵ ̴a̷l̴l…  \nI’̴l̷l̸ ̷b̷e̸c̷o̴m̶e̴ ̷p̷a̶r̴t̸ ̷o̸f̴ ̷t̴h̶e̴ ̸p̴a̴t̷t̵e̸r̶n̷.\n\n\\[Part 5 Coming Soon\\]\n\nT̸i̶m̴e’̷s ̶r̶u̶n̷n̸i̷n̴g̴ ̷o̶u̸t̸....\n\n "},"90":{"title":"the woods from above","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jpgfco\/the_woods_from_above\/","flair":null,"author":"SolutionStatus8449","selftext":"report one\n\nday one,i just got my frist job. im out in the woods in a watchtower, I got the night shift, kidea boring but i'll wait and see if i'll find anything. right now theres forest fires, outside is freezing\n\nluckily i have a heater inside, and a tv that can only play CDs for some reason.\n\nend of report one\n\n\n\nreport two\n\ni saw smoke from what seems to be a campfire but i aint taking any risks over here, im watching it with a eagles eyes making sure its not getting any bigger, other than that its smooth sails up here.\n\nfor some reason boss told me to make these reports. probably to put clues together if i go missing, but thats not gonna happen... i hope.\n\nend of report two\n\n\n\nreport three\n\nthis night i saw the trees shaking. not from the wind, no, it couldn't be the wind, for starts it was to, heavy, and it was in one spot. and it was moving from place to place im going to report it at the end of this report. that wasn't it the fire is still there somehow, I'm checking the spots where it was shaking tomorrow.\n\nend of report three.\n\n\n\nreport four\n\ni went down there and i sware to god i saw something in the shadows looking at me. first i saw claw marks on the trees, but it wasn't from wildlife it looked more like a knife scratch, and then i started seeing blood it started with small puddles then bigger ones and then when it ended a bit more forward a body limp against a tree his jaw was dislocated and his flesh around the mouth was torn apart to be forced to smile his eyes were plucked out his cloths tore to shreds, blood everywhere, then thats when i saw it. pure white eyes starring into my soul i ran back as soon as i saw it. im not telling the boss. im telling the f.b.i.\n\nend of report four\n\n\n\nreport five \n\nthey said they will get agents there in about 2 days, in the mean time they told me to stay in the watch tower tell my boss and them any weird activity.\n\ni cant get the bodys face out of my head, im walking around with a pistol every where i go, not like i have that much room to walk around, my eyes dot to everything out of the corner of my eye.\n\ni have to relax, i need to relax if i want to live.\n\nend of report five\n\n\n\nreport six\n\nthe fire has gone out today. guess it was a campfire. i cant get the \"thing\" out of my head. i'm more relaxed now ive closed the curtains and i checked what was in my draws and there was a CD labed \"October 5th\"\n\nnow im not a sucker for horror movies but i'll take what i can get, and isnt it meant to be October 13?

Late autumn had stripped the pines bare, leaving their branches like crooked fingers against a gray sky. He knelt beside the tracks, his breath fogging in the crisp air, and frowned. They weren’t right. Too big for a bear—sixteen inches heel to claw—and the stride was off, loping yet deliberate, almost human. He traced a finger along the edge of one print, where the mud held the faint curve of something like a toenail.\n\n“Mountain lion, maybe,” he muttered, though he didn’t believe it. Twenty years patrolling these woods, and he’d never seen anything like this. He straightened, brushing dirt off his knees, and scanned the clearing. The campsite was abandoned, firepit cold, but a shredded backpack lay tangled in the underbrush. He picked it up, noting the claw marks—deep, ragged, like something had torn into it with purpose. A scrap of deer hide fluttered from the strap, stained with something dark and tacky. Blood, maybe.\n\nElias adjusted his hat, the brim shadowing his tired hazel eyes, and tried to shake the unease creeping up his spine. He’d seen plenty out here—lost hikers, bear attacks, even a meth lab once—but this felt different. Wrong. His radio crackled at his hip, but he ignored it. No point calling it in yet; dispatch would just laugh him off. *Bigfoot sighting, Crowe?*\n\nHe followed the tracks a few yards, winding through the trees until they veered toward the old trailhead. That’s when he remembered: this was near where Danny went missing. Twenty years ago, two dumb kids sneaking out to camp, and only one came back. Elias had told the cops Danny wandered off, drawn by some sound in the dark. “Something’s calling me,” Danny had said, grinning like it was a game. Elias never saw him again. The guilt still gnawed at him, a dull ache he drowned in coffee and routine.\n\nA twig snapped behind him. Elias spun, hand on his holster, but it was just a squirrel darting up a trunk. He exhaled, cursing himself. Getting jumpy over nothing. Still, he couldn’t unsee the tracks, couldn’t unhear the echo of Danny’s voice in his head. He pulled out his phone—no signal, as usual—and snapped a photo of the prints. Evidence. Something to show the old-timers at the diner, see if they’d spin one of their yarns about skinwalkers or whatever else they blamed for bad luck out here.\n\nThe wind picked up, rattling the branches, and for a moment, Elias swore it carried a sound—a low, guttural moan that wasn’t quite animal. He froze, listening, but it didn’t come again. Just the forest playing tricks. He slung the ruined backpack over his shoulder and headed back to his truck, the tracks stretching out behind him like a promise of something waiting in the shadows.\n\nElias tossed the shredded backpack into the bed of his truck, the dull thunk of it hitting the metal echoing in the stillness. He rubbed his hands together, trying to shake the chill that wasn’t just from the autumn air. The tracks gnawed at him, a puzzle he couldn’t leave unsolved. He climbed into the cab, the familiar creak of the seat grounding him, and started the engine. Millie’s Diner was a twenty-minute drive down the winding forest road—plenty of time to decide if he was overreacting or if something was truly off.\n\nThe forest blurred past, a monochrome wash of browns and grays, until the neon sign of Millie’s flickered into view, half its letters burnt out so it read “M lie’s Di er.” The place was a relic, squat and weathered, with peeling paint and a gravel lot littered with cigarette butts. It was the heartbeat of this nowhere town—half a dozen houses, a gas station, and a church that only opened for funerals, its steeple leaning like it was tired of standing. Elias parked beside a rusted pickup with a bumper sticker proclaiming “I Brake for Sasquatch” and grabbed the backpack. Maybe someone here would recognize it, or at least spin a tale worth hearing.\n\nInside, the air was thick with grease and the ghosts of a thousand fried breakfasts. The jukebox hummed a scratchy rendition of “Mama Tried,” and the fluorescent lights buzzed like trapped flies. Millie, all gray curls and sharp eyes, wiped the counter with a rag that’d seen better days. A handful of regulars dotted the room: Roy Tanner, hunched over a plate of hashbrowns; Mrs. Tully, knitting in her corner booth; Jimmy Platt, a wiry kid barely out of high school, nursing a Coke and scribbling in a notebook; and Lila Henshaw, a retired schoolteacher with a penchant for gossip, sipping tea by the window.\n\n“Crowe,” Millie rasped, voice like sandpaper from decades of Pall Malls. “You’re early. Bad night, or bad day already?” She slid a chipped mug his way without asking.\n\n“Bad find,” Elias said, dropping the backpack on the counter. The claw marks caught the light, ugly and raw. “Up by the old trailhead. Tracks, too—big, weird. Not bear, not anything I know. You seen this bag before?”\n\nMillie poured coffee, black as tar, and squinted at the damage. “Looks like something got mad at it. Hunters were in yesterday—those loudmouths from downstate—said the deer’s been scarce, like something’s spooking ‘em. Heard howling, too, but not wolves. I told ‘em it’s the wind. Always is.” She tapped the counter with a chipped nail. “Roy! Ranger’s got a chew toy for you.”\n\nRoy shuffled over, his boots scuffing the linoleum. He was all sinew and stories, a trapper turned barstool prophet after arthritis twisted his hands into claws of their own. He peered at the backpack, then at Elias, his eyes cloudy but sharp. “Skinwalker,” he said, like he was diagnosing a cold. “Navajo witch, gone feral. Sheds its skin, walks as a beast. Mimics voices to lure you out. You hear anything funny up there?”\n\nElias sipped the coffee, bitter and hot, and shrugged. “Just wind, Roy. Tracks were humanish, though—too big for normal.”\n\nRoy leaned in, tobacco breath curling between them. “My granddad saw one, ‘52. Tall as a pine, eyes like coals. Followed him from dusk to dawn, whispering his name ‘til he near lost his mind. You find bones with it?”\n\n“No bones,” Elias said, dodging the deer hide in his memory. “Just this.” He didn’t need Roy spinning a saga—not yet.\n\nMrs. Tully’s needles paused, her voice cutting through the hum. “Ain’t no skinwalker, Roy. It’s a wendigo. Starved spirits, cursed from eating their own. This forest’s got a hunger in it, Elias. Your kin’d know.”\n\nElias’s jaw tightened. “My kin?”\n\n“Your folks,” she said, resuming her knitting with a clack. “Crowes go back to the settlers—tough stock, ‘til the winter of ‘73 broke ‘em. Half starved, half vanished. Word was, some turned to meat they shouldn’t have touched. Bad blood lingers.”\n\nMillie snorted, but it was half-hearted. “Cannibals, Tully? You been reading Jimmy’s scripts?” She glanced at the kid, who looked up, grinning like he’d been caught.\n\n“Could be aliens. Or a wendigo and a skinwalker—tag-team horror flick,” Jimmy piped up, pushing his glasses up his nose.\n\n“Stick to your movies, kid,” Elias said, though he cracked a faint smile. Jimmy was harmless, always dreaming up monsters for screenplays he’d never finish.\n\nLila Henshaw set her teacup down with a clink, her voice prim but edged. “It’s not a movie, James. My great-aunt lived through that winter—said the Crowes’ cabin was the last standing, ‘til it wasn’t. Found it empty, fire still smoldering, but tracks led off into the snow. Big ones, like you’re saying. Folks didn’t talk about it after—bad luck.”\n\nElias’s gut twisted. His dad had mentioned the homestead once, a rare sober night by the fire. “Crowes were survivors,” he’d said, eyes distant. “Hard times make hard choices.” Then he’d clammed up, pouring another whiskey. Elias had been ten, too young to press.\n\n“Any of you recognize the bag?” he asked, steering back to solid ground. “Campers, hunters?”\n\n“Nope,” Millie said, crossing her arms. “But I’d check with Old Man Carver down the road. He’s been here since dirt was new—knows every face that passes through.”\n\nRoy grunted. “Carver’s half-crazy. Thinks the woods talk to him.”\n\n“Maybe they do,” Jimmy muttered, scribbling again.\n\nLila tilted her head. “He’s not wrong, Roy. Carver’s pa hunted with your granddad, Elias. If anyone’s got a bead on this, it’s him.”\n\nElias finished his coffee, left a crumpled five on the counter, and grabbed the backpack. “Thanks for the history lesson. I’ll check the logs, maybe swing by Carver’s.” But as he stood, Jimmy slid over, holding out a crumpled flyer—*Lost Dog: Rusty, Red Setter, Last Seen Near Trailhead, 10\/28*.\n\n“Found this on the board,” Jimmy said. “Same spot, maybe? Owner’s number’s there.”\n\nElias pocketed it, nodding. “Good catch.” A missing dog wasn’t much, but it was another thread.\n\nOutside, dusk was creeping in, the sky a bruise over the treeline. He drove to Carver’s first, the cabin a sagging heap of logs and tin, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Three dogs barked from the porch, all ribs and teeth, as Carver emerged, shotgun resting easy in his gnarled hands.\n\n“Crowe,” he rasped, beard a white snarl. “What’s that you’re hauling?”\n\nElias held up the backpack. “Found it near the trailhead. Tracks, too—big, wrong. You hear anything lately?”\n\nCarver spat into the gravel. “Heard it, three nights back. Howling, deep-like. Dogs wouldn’t leave the porch—smelled something bad. Ain’t no bear—too smart, too quiet after. Woods been restless since your granddad’s day.”\n\n“Restless how?” Elias pressed, Carver’s words echoing Lila’s.\n\n“Your pa never told you?” Carver’s eyes glinted. “He hunted up there, ‘fore you were born. Came back pale, said he saw shadows—tall ones, moving wrong. Quit hunting after. You watch yourself, boy.” He retreated inside, door slamming.\n\nElias drove to the ranger station, the road twisting through shadows that felt too alive. The station was a squat cabin, its porch sagging under years of neglect. Inside, he tossed the backpack on his desk and flipped open the logbook—trail repairs, a lost hiker two weeks back, coyotes near the river. No missing campers, but he called the number from Jimmy’s flyer. A woman answered, voice frayed.\n\n“Rusty’s mine,” she said. “Disappeared last week—chased something into the woods and didn’t come back. You find him?”\n\n“Just a bag,” Elias said. “I’ll keep an eye out.” He hung up, adding *Rusty, 10\/28* to the log.\n\nHe spread out a topo map, tracing the old trailhead—a mile from where he and Danny had camped. The memory clawed up. They’d been fourteen—Elias, quiet and cautious; Danny, all fire and dares. They’d swiped beers from Elias’s dad and pitched a tent near the creek, laughing at ghost stories ‘til the dark pressed in. Danny’s mom, Ruth, had been furious—grounded him for a month before that night, but he’d snuck out anyway. She’d blamed Elias after, her screams echoing through the search: “You should’ve stopped him!”\n\nMara had been there too, eleven and fearless, tagging along ‘til their dad dragged her home. She’d moved away years ago, but last Christmas she’d asked, “You ever wonder if Danny’s still out there?” Elias hadn’t answered. Ruth had left town a year later, house still empty on Pine Street.\n\nHe pulled out his laptop, uploaded the track photo, and zoomed in. The edges were too clean, the stride too purposeful. He searched *skinwalker*—shape-shifters, betrayal—then *wendigo*—gaunt, antlered, born from desperation. He slammed the laptop shut, the room closing in.\n\nThe wind howled, rattling the windows, and there it was—that moan, low and guttural, weaving through the gusts. Elias grabbed his flashlight, stepped onto the porch, and swept the beam across the trees. The forest stared back, a wall of shadows, branches swaying like they were reaching. Nothing moved—or so he thought. He turned to go inside, boots scuffing the warped boards, when the wind shifted, sharp and cold, tugging at his jacket. It carried a faint clatter, like pebbles rolling, and his gaze dropped to the edge of the porch.\n\nThere, where the dirt met the wood, a small, pale shape gleamed—uncovered by the gust, as if the earth had spat it out. Elias froze, beam trembling as it locked on the object: a child’s finger bone, delicate and scored with jagged teeth marks, half-buried in the soil. The wind had peeled back a thin layer of leaves and dust, exposing it like a gift—or a warning. His breath caught, the air suddenly too thick, and he crouched, hand hovering. It wasn’t weathered like some old relic; the marks were fresh, the bone still faintly slick.\n\n“Danny?” he whispered, the name slipping out like a plea, raw and unbidden. The wind snatched it, swirling it into the dark, and for a heartbeat, he swore he heard an answer—a faint laugh, high and familiar, drifting from the trees. He jerked upright, flashlight slashing the shadows, but the forest gave nothing back. Just silence, heavy and watching. He scooped the bone into his pocket, its cold weight pressing against him, and stumbled inside, locking the door with shaking hands.\n\nElias stood on the porch, the child’s finger bone cold against his palm. The laugh—Danny’s laugh—hung in the air, a thread of memory unraveling into the night. He clicked off the flashlight, letting the dark swallow him, and listened. The wind moaned through the pines, but nothing else came. No footsteps, no whispers. Just his heartbeat, loud and unsteady. He shoved the bone into his jacket pocket, a grim keepsake, and stepped back inside, locking the door behind him.\n\nSleep didn’t come easy. The ranger station creaked like an old ship, every gust rattling the walls. He lay on the cot, staring at the ceiling, the bone’s weight pressing through his pocket. Danny’s voice looped in his head—*“Something’s calling me”*—blending with Roy’s skinwalker tales and Mrs. Tully’s wendigo warnings. By dawn, exhaustion won, but his dreams were jagged: a figure too tall, too thin, antlers scraping the sky, eyes glinting like the bone in the dirt.\n\nMorning brought clarity—or at least purpose. Elias brewed coffee, strong enough to strip paint, and hauled out his gear. If something was out there, he’d find proof. He grabbed a pair of trail cams from the storage closet, their batteries still good, and packed his truck: flashlight, flare gun, topo map, the backpack as a marker. The tracks were his lead, and he wasn’t waiting for whatever made them to come knocking.\n\nBefore heading out, he called Mara. She lived three states away now, a nurse with a husband and a kid, but she’d always been the one who understood him. The phone rang twice before her voice cut through, warm but tired. “Eli? You okay? It’s early.”\n\n“Yeah, just… checking in,” he lied, pacing the station. “You remember that night with Danny?”\n\nA pause. “Hard to forget. Why?”\n\n“Found something weird out here. Tracks, a torn-up bag. Made me think of him.” He didn’t mention the bone—not yet.\n\n“Eli, don’t go digging up ghosts. You’ve carried that long enough.” Her tone sharpened. “You hear something out there, you call me, okay? Not just the cops.”\n\n“Promise,” he said, though he wasn’t sure he meant it. He hung up, the guilt a familiar ache, and drove to the old trailhead.\n\nThe forest woke slow under a leaden sky, mist curling through the trees. He parked where the gravel gave way to dirt and slung the first cam over his shoulder. The tracks were still there, crisp in the mud, leading deeper into the pines. He followed, setting the first cam on a sturdy trunk, its lens aimed along the path. The second went a quarter-mile in, strapped to a boulder overlooking a ravine. He worked fast, the silence pressing heavier with each step, until the trail dipped into a hollow where the air smelled of damp rot.\n\nOn the way back, he stopped at Old Man Carver’s place, a ramshackle cabin off the main road. Carver was a local myth—ninety if he was a day, living alone with a shotgun and a pack of mangy dogs. Elias knocked, the backpack in hand, and the old man answered, squinting through a tangle of white beard.\n\n“Crowe,” Carver grunted, voice like gravel. “What’s that mess?”\n\n“Found it up near the trailhead,” Elias said, showing the claw marks. “Tracks, too—big, wrong. You see anything lately?”\n\nCarver spat into the dirt. “Heard it. Howling, three nights back. Dogs went crazy, wouldn’t leave the porch. Ain’t no bear—too smart, too quiet after. Woods been restless since your granddad’s day.”\n\n“Restless how?”\n\nCarver’s eyes narrowed. “Ask your pa’s old hunting stories. He knew.” He slammed the door, leaving Elias with more questions than answers.\n\nBack at the station, he waited. The cams were motion-triggered, uploading via a spotty satellite link. He busied himself with paperwork—overdue trail erosion reports—but his eyes kept flicking to the laptop. By dusk, the first ping came. He opened the feed, breath catching. The footage was grainy, timestamped 5:47 PM: a blur of movement, too fast to track. He rewound, frame by frame. There—a figure, tall and emaciated, hunched against the twilight. Antler-like protrusions jutted from its skull, limbs bent wrong, like a marionette cut loose. It paused, head cocked, staring at the lens with eyes that burned white in the infrared. Then it was gone.\n\n“Jesus,” Elias muttered, rewinding again. The second cam pinged minutes later—same hollow, same figure, closer now. It moved with purpose, circling back toward the station. He checked the map: the hollow was three miles out, but the tracks suggested it could cover ground fast. He grabbed his radio, thumb hovering, but stopped. *Monster on my trail cams*? He’d be a laughingstock—or worse.\n\nHe called Millie instead. “You got anyone who can check a tape? Something’s out here.”\n\n“Jimmy’s your man,” she said. “Kid’s got a laptop and too much time. I’ll send him up.”\n\nJimmy arrived an hour later, all nervous energy and Monster Energy cans. He plugged into Elias’s system, eyes widening at the footage. “Holy shit, man. That’s not CGI. Look at the shadow—consistent, real. You’ve got a cryptid.”\n\n“Not helping,” Elias snapped, but Jimmy’s excitement was contagious. They pulled stills, zooming in. The antlers weren’t bone—more like twisted branches, woven into the skull. The skin looked flayed, peeling in strips.\n\n“Skinwalker vibes,” Jimmy said, “but the starvation look? Wendigo. You’re in deep, Crowe.”\n\n“Shut up and save it,” Elias said, but his mind raced. He sent Jimmy off with a copy, telling him to keep quiet. Alone again, he stared at the screen. The thing knew he was watching—it *wanted* him to see.\n\nThe next day, he went back. Armed—flare gun in his holster, knife on his belt—he retraced the tracks past the cams. They veered off-trail, through brambles, stopping at a creek, its banks slick with frost. Across the water, a cave mouth loomed, half-hidden by vines, exhaling a sour stench. He waded through, boots slipping, and climbed the bank, flashlight shaking in his grip.\n\nInside, the cave swallowed light. The beam danced over damp walls: a pile of bones—deer, rabbit, some human—a ribcage gnawed clean, a femur split for marrow. His stomach turned, but he pressed deeper, the air growing colder, thicker. The beam caught a scrap of fabric—blue, faded, snagged on a rock. He crouched, heart hammering. Danny’s jacket, torn and crusted with black.\n\n“Danny,” he whispered, voice echoing. The cave answered—a growl, low and rising. He spun, flare gun raised, but the beam found shadows. Footsteps circled, heavy, deliberate. He fired the flare, red light erupting—and there it was.\n\nTaller than any man, its skin hung loose, gray and mottled, peeling like a shed husk. Antlers—or something like them—sprouted from a too-narrow skull, framing eyes that glowed with sickly hunger. Claws clicked, jaw slack with jagged teeth. Not just wendigo, not just skinwalker—a hybrid, born from ancient wrongness.\n\nIt lunged, claws slashing. Elias swung the knife, catching its arm. It shrieked—a child’s scream through a broken radio—and recoiled, black blood dripping. He ran, splashing through the creek, branches clawing his face, until he reached the truck. He locked the doors, hands shaking, and floored it back.\n\nAt the station, he barricaded the door and pored over the map. The cave sat near the old Crowe homestead site, abandoned since the 1870s. He dug out a ledger: *Incident Reports, 1870-1880*. One entry, January 1874:\n\n*“Settlement lost to storm. Twelve souls unaccounted. Survivor claims kin turned to cannibal acts in hunger. Tracks found, inhuman, leading north. Area deemed cursed.”*\n\nBelow: *Ezekiel Crowe*. His ancestor. Elias’s mug shattered on the floor. Mrs. Tully was right—his blood birthed this.\n\nHe called Mara again, voice tight. “You ever hear Dad talk about the homestead?”\n\n“Once,” she said, hesitant. “Said it was haunted, that Grandpa saw things—tall shadows, voices. Why?”\n\n“Found something. Old reports. Our family… might’ve done something bad.”\n\n“Eli, get out of there. Now.”\n\n“Too late,” he said, hanging up as the wind carried his name—Danny’s voice, pleading: “Elias, help me.” The cams pinged: the creature, pacing the ridge, speaking now—Danny’s voice, Mara’s, his dad’s: “Hard times, son.”\n\nHe wasn’t waiting. He loaded flares, strapped on his knife, and drove back, the forest a tunnel of shadows. At the creek, he waded in, the cave’s stench pulling him forward. Inside, the bones shifted, shadows stretching. The creature crouched atop the pile, Danny’s jacket in its claws.\n\n“You left me,” it said, Danny’s voice cracking, then growling. “You let me go.”\n\n“You’re not him,” Elias said, flare gun trembling. But its eyes—hazel, like Danny’s—twisted his gut. It smiled, teeth glinting, and dropped the jacket.\n\n“Come closer,” it hissed, Mara’s voice now. “See what we’ve become.”\n\nHe fired, the flare streaking, but it darted aside, vanishing. The cave rumbled, dust falling. It wasn’t just hunting him—it was claiming him, tying him to the curse his family sowed.\n\nElias stood in the cave’s mouth, flare gun trembling, the red glow of his last shot fading into the dark. The creature’s words—*“See what we’ve become”*—echoed in Mara’s voice, then Danny’s, a chorus of the lost twisting his resolve. The air was thick with rot and cold, the bone pile beneath the thing glinting like a throne of ruin. He clutched the topo map in his free hand, creased and damp, its lines anchoring him. The cave sat dead center of the old Crowe homestead site—he’d triple-checked it against the ledger. This wasn’t random. It was his family’s grave, and he’d walked right into it.\n\nThe creature shifted, its antlered silhouette blurring as it circled, claws scraping stone. Elias backed toward the entrance, boots slipping. “You’re not them,” he said, louder, as if conviction could sever the doubt. But those hazel eyes—Danny’s eyes—burned through the gloom, and its crooked smile split a jagged maw.\n\n“You left me,” it growled, Danny’s voice cracking into a snarl. “Left us all.” It lunged, faster than before, and Elias dove aside, the flare gun clattering away. Claws sparked against the wall, and he scrambled for his knife, slashing upward. Black blood splattered, the thing shrieking—half-human, half-beast. He bolted for the creek, splashing through icy water, the map crumpling in his fist. The forest swallowed him, branches snapping, lungs burning. Behind, the creature’s howl rose—rage, personal, ancient. He reached the truck, slammed the door, and floored it back to the station, the rear-view mirror empty but his pulse screaming.\n\nInside, he barricaded the door, chest heaving. The topo map lay crumpled on the floor—he snatched it up, smoothing it. The homestead was a bullseye, the cave its heart, tracks radiating like veins. He grabbed the ledger: *“Cannibal acts… tracks inhuman… area cursed.”* Below, in faded ink: *“E.C. fled north, pursued by shadow.”* His ancestor had run, leaving this behind.\n\nThe radio crackled—Millie, frantic. “Elias, Jimmy’s gone AWOL—left a note about ‘proving it.’ Heading your way.”\n\n“Shit,” Elias muttered. He dialed Jimmy—voicemail. The kid was chasing his cryptid, and Elias knew where: the cave. He couldn’t leave him. He reloaded the flare gun—two shots—strapped the knife tighter, and grabbed a gas can from the shed. Fire had hurt it; fire might end it. But he needed more. He rummaged the storage closet, finding a rusted bear trap and a coil of rope—crude, but something.\n\nThe drive back was a blur, the forest a tunnel under a moonless sky. He parked a half-mile out, topo map tucked into his jacket, and hiked in, flashlight off. The creek glinted, the cave’s stench stronger—meat and ash. A whimper echoed—not the creature, but Jimmy.\n\nElias crept inside, knife out, eyes adjusting. The bone pile loomed, larger, fresh additions glistening. Jimmy slumped against the wall, glasses cracked, leg bent wrong, blood streaking his jacket. He was alive—shallow breaths.\n\n“Crowe?” Jimmy croaked. “It… got me. Wanted proof… stupid…”\n\n“Hold on,” Elias whispered, binding Jimmy’s gash with a shirt strip. “We’re getting out.”\n\nA laugh slithered from the shadows—Danny’s, Mara’s, then a rasp. The creature emerged, dragging Rusty’s corpse, collar glinting. It tossed the dog atop the pile, a taunt, and fixed Elias with hazel eyes.\n\n“Your blood,” it hissed, his dad’s slur. “Your curse. Join us.”\n\nElias hauled Jimmy up, backing toward the entrance. The creature stalked forward, claws clicking, skin peeling wet. He splashed the gas can across the bone pile, the walls, but kept half, rope in hand. The thing paused, head tilting.\n\n“For Danny,” he said, firing a flare into the fuel. Flames roared, swallowing the bones. The creature shrieked, lunging through fire, antlers ablaze. Elias swung the knife, catching its throat—black blood sprayed. It clawed his arm, deep and searing, but he shoved Jimmy out, diving after as the cave blazed.\n\nThey stumbled to the creek, collapsing as smoke billowed. The screams twisted—Danny’s pleas, Mara’s cries—then deepened, the cave trembling. Elias looked back: the creature burst through the flames, burning but alive, charging across the water.\n\n“Move!” he yelled, dragging Jimmy toward the trees. The thing was faster, fire trailing, eyes locked on him. Elias dropped the rope, grabbed the bear trap, and snapped it open, tossing it into the mud. The creature hit it—metal clamped its leg, bone crunching. It roared, thrashing, flames licking higher.\n\nElias pulled Jimmy behind a pine, gas can still in hand. The creature tore free, trap dangling, and lunged again. He hurled the can—fuel arced, splashing its burning form—and fired his last flare. The explosion was deafening, a fireball erupting as the creature became a torch. It staggered, shrieking every voice it knew—Danny, Mara, his dad, Ruth—then collapsed, a writhing pyre. The forest shook, trees groaning, as if the curse itself screamed.\n\nElias shielded Jimmy, heat searing his face, arm bleeding freely. The thing clawed the ground, antlers cracking, skin sloughing into ash. Its hazel eyes met his, flickering—Danny’s, then empty. It stilled, fire consuming what remained, a blackened husk curling in the mud.\n\nJimmy coughed, clutching his leg. “Dead?”\n\nElias nodded, shaking. “Think so.” His arm throbbed, claw marks oozing. He pulled the topo map out, tracing the homestead’s charred spot. The cave burned behind, smoke rising like a signal. He’d ended it—hadn’t he?\n\nHe got Jimmy to the truck, radioing Millie. “Medic—trailhead road. Jimmy’s hurt.” She cursed but promised help. As they waited, Elias bandaged his arm, gas fumes lingering on his hands. The forest was quiet, wind carrying ash.\n\nMedics took Jimmy—broken leg, shock, alive. Elias stayed at the station, topo map spread, ledger open. He called Mara, voice raw. “It’s done. Burned it out.”\n\n“Eli, what happened?”\n\n“Family curse. Ended it.” He didn’t mention the claw marks, the doubt.\n\n“Come stay with us,” she said. “Please.”\n\n“Maybe,” he lied, hanging up. He faced the mirror. His hazel eyes stared back—tired, steady—until they glinted, sharp and hungry. He blinked, and it was gone. Just his face, pale and worn. He turned away, map crumpling under his fist, and poured coffee. No voices came. Not yet.\n\nDays later, Millie called. “Jimmy’s talking—says you’re a hero. Wants to write it.”\n\n“Skip the hero part,” Elias said. “Keep my name out.” He hung up, glancing at the map. The fire had spread—rangers reported a contained blaze near the homestead site, cave collapsed. He packed a bag—flare gun, knife, map—locked the station, and drove toward Mara’s.\n\nThe road wound through pines, headlights slicing dark. A mile out, he slowed. A bone glinted by the trees—small, scored, fresh. The wind whispered: “Elias…” He dropped it, floored the gas, and didn’t look back. His arm itched, and Mara’s mirror waited."},"94":{"title":"I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 2 of 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jm8nxd\/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never\/","flair":null,"author":"CosmicOrphan2020","selftext":"It was a fun little adventure. Exploring through the trees, hearing all kinds of birds and insect life. One big problem with Vietnam is there are always mosquitos everywhere, and surprise surprise, the jungle was no different. I still had a hard time getting acquainted with the Vietnamese heat, but luckily the hottest days of the year had come and gone. It was a rather cloudy day, but I figured if I got too hot in the jungle, I could potentially look forward to some much-welcomed rain. Although I was very much enjoying myself, even with the heat and biting critters, Aaron’s crew insisted on stopping every 10 minutes to document our journey. This was their expedition after all, so I guess we couldn’t complain. \n\nI got to know Aaron’s colleagues a little better. The two guys were Steve (the hairy guy) and Miles the cameraman. They were nice enough guys I guess, but what was kind of annoying was Miles would occasionally film me and the group, even though we weren’t supposed to be in the documentary. The maroon-haired girl of their group was Sophie. The two of us got along really great and we talked about what it was like for each of us back home. Sophie was actually raised in the Appalachians in a family of all boys - and already knew how to use a firearm by the time she was ten. Even though we were completely different people, I really cared for her, because like me, she clearly didn’t have the easiest of upbringings – as I noticed under her tattoos were a number of scars. A creepy little quirk she had was whenever we heard an unusual noise, she would rather casually say the same thing... ‘If you see something, no you didn’t. If you hear something, no you didn’t...’ \n\nWe had been hiking through the jungle for a few hours now, and there was still no sign of the mysterious trail. Aaron did say all we needed to do was continue heading north-west and we would eventually stumble upon it. But it was by now that our group were beginning to complain, as it appeared we were making our way through just a regular jungle - that wasn’t even unique enough to be put on a tourist map. What were we doing here? Why weren’t we on our way to Hue City or Ha Long Bay? These were the questions our group were beginning to ask, and although I didn’t say it out loud, it was now what I was asking... But as it turned out, we were wrong to complain so quickly. Because less than an hour later, ready to give up and turn around... we finally discovered something... \n\nIn the middle of the jungle, cutting through a dispersal of sparse trees, was a very thin and narrow outline of sorts... It was some kind of pathway... A trail... We had found it! Covered in thick vegetation, our group had almost walked completely by it – and if it wasn’t for Hayley, stopping to tie her shoelaces, we may still have been searching. Clearly no one had walked this pathway for a very long time, and for what reason, we did not know. But we did it! We had found the trail – and all we needed to do now was follow wherever it led us. \n\nI’m not even sure who was the happier to have found the trail: Aaron and his colleagues, who reacted as though they made an archaeological discovery - or us, just relieved this entire day was not for nothing. Anxious to continue along the trail before it got dark, we still had to wait patiently for Aaron’s team. But because they were so busy filming their documentary, it quickly became too late in the day to continue. The sun in Vietnam usually sets around 6 pm, but in the interior of the forest, it sets a lot sooner. \n\nMaking camp that night, we all pitched our separate tents. I actually didn’t own a tent, but Hayley suggested we bunk together, like we were having our very own sleepover – which meant Brodie rather unwillingly had to sleep with Chris. Although the night brought a boatload of bugs and strange noises, Tyler sparked up a campfire for us to make some s'mores and tell a few scary stories. I never really liked scary stories, and that night, although I was having a lot of fun, I really didn’t care for the stories Aaron had to tell. Knowing I was from Utah, Aaron intentionally told the story of Skinwalker Ranch – and now I had more than one reason not to go back home.  \n\nThere were some stories shared that night I did enjoy - particularly the ones told by Tyler. Having travelled all over the world, Tyler acquired many adventures he was just itching to tell. For instance, when he was backpacking through the Bolivian Amazon a few years ago, a boat had pulled up by the side of the river. Five rather shady men jump out, and one of them walks right up to Tyler, holding a jar containing some kind of drink, and a dozen dead snakes inside! This man offered the drink to Tyler, and when he asked what the drink was, the man replied it was only vodka, and that the dead snakes were just for flavour. Rather foolishly, Tyler accepted the drink – where only half an hour later, he was throbbing white foam from the mouth. Thinking he had just been poisoned and was on the verge of death, the local guide in his group tells him, ‘No worry Señor. It just snake poison. You probably drink too much.’ Well, the reason this stranger offered the drink to Tyler was because, funnily enough, if you drink vodka containing a little bit of snake venom, your body will eventually become immune to snake bites over time. Of all the stories Tyler told me - both the funny and idiotic, that one was definitely my favourite! \n\nFeeling exhausted from a long day of tropical hiking, I called it an early night – that and... most of the group were smoking (you know what). Isn’t the middle of the jungle the last place you should be doing that? Maybe that’s how all those soldiers saw what they saw. There were no creatures here. They were just stoned... and not from rock-throwing apes. \n\nOne minor criticism I have with Vietnam – aside from all the garbage, mosquitos and other vermin, was that the nights were so hot I always found it incredibly hard to sleep. The heat was very intense that night, and even though I didn’t believe there were any monsters in this jungle - when you sleep in the jungle in complete darkness, hearing all kinds of sounds, it’s definitely enough to keep you awake.  \n\nEarly that next morning, I get out of mine and Hayley’s tent to stretch my legs. I was the only one up for the time being, and in the early hours of the jungle’s dim daylight, I felt completely relaxed and at peace – very Zen, as some may say. Since I was the only one up, I thought it would be nice to make breakfast for everyone – and so, going over to find what food I could rummage out from one of the backpacks... I suddenly get this strange feeling I’m being watched... Listening to my instincts, I turn up from the backpack, and what I see in my line of sight, standing as clear as day in the middle of the jungle... I see another person... \n\nIt was a young man... no older than myself. He was wearing pieces of torn, olive-green jungle clothing, camouflaged as green as the forest around him. Although he was too far away for me to make out his face, I saw on his left side was some kind of black charcoal substance, trickling down his left shoulder. Once my tired eyes better adjust on this stranger, standing only 50 feet away from me... I realize what the dark substance is... It was a horrific burn mark. Like he’d been badly scorched! What’s worse, I then noticed on the scorched side of his head, where his ear should have been... it was... It was hollow.  \n\nAlthough I hadn’t picked up on it at first, I then realized his tattered green clothes... They were not just jungle clothes... The clothes he was wearing... It was the same colour of green American soldiers wore in Vietnam... All the way back in the 60s. \n\nTelling myself I must be seeing things, I try and snap myself out of it. I rub my eyes extremely hard, and I even look away and back at him, assuming he would just disappear... But there he still was, staring at me... and not knowing what to do, or even what to say, I just continue to stare back at him... Before he says to me – words I will never forget... The young man says to me, in clear audible words...  \n\n‘Careful Miss... Charlie’s everywhere...’ \n\nOnly seconds after he said these words to me, in the blink of an eye - almost as soon as he appeared... the young man was gone... What just happened? What - did I hallucinate? Was I just dreaming? There was no possible way I could have seen what I saw... He was like a... ghost... Once it happened, I remember feeling completely numb all over my body. I couldn’t feel my legs or the ends of my fingers. I felt like I wanted to cry... But not because I was scared, but... because I suddenly felt sad... and I didn’t really know why.  \n\nFor the last few years, I learned not to believe something unless you see it with your own eyes. But I didn’t even know what it was I saw. Although my first instinct was to tell someone, once the others were out of their tents... I chose to keep what happened to myself. I just didn’t want to face the ridicule – for the others to look at me like I was insane. I didn’t even tell Aaron or Sophie, and they believed every fairy-tale under the sun. \n\nBut I think everyone knew something was up with me. I mean, I was shaking. I couldn’t even finish my breakfast. Hayley said I looked extremely pale and wondered if I was sick. Although I was in good health – physically anyway, Hayley and the others were worried. I really mustn’t have looked good, because fearing I may have contracted something from a mosquito bite, they were willing to ditch the expedition and take me back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. Touched by how much they were looking out for me, I insisted I was fine and that it wasn’t anything more than a stomach bug. \n\nAfter breakfast that morning, we pack up our tents and continue to follow along the trail. Everything was the usual as the day before. We kept following the trail and occasionally stopped to document and film. Even though I convinced myself that what I saw must have been a hallucination, I could not stop replaying the words in my head... “Careful miss... Charlie’s everywhere.” There it was again... Charlie... Who is Charlie?... Feeling like I needed to know, I ask Chris what he meant by “Keep a lookout for Charlie”? Chris said in the Vietnam War movies he’d watched, that’s what the American soldiers always called the enemy... \n\nWhat if I wasn’t hallucinating after all? Maybe what I saw really was a ghost... The ghost of an American soldier who died in the war – and believing the enemy was still lurking in the jungle somewhere, he was trying to warn me... But what if he wasn’t? What if tourists really were vanishing here - and there was some truth to the legends? What if it wasn’t “Charlie” the young man was warning me of? Maybe what he meant by Charlie... was something entirely different... Even as I contemplated all this, there was still a part of me that chose not to believe it – that somehow, the jungle was playing tricks on me. I had always been a superstitious person – that's what happens when you grow up in the church... But why was it so hard for me to believe I saw a ghost? I finally had evidence of the supernatural right in front of me... and I was choosing not to believe it... What was it Sophie said? “If you see something. No you didn’t. If you hear something... No you didn’t.” \n\nEven so... the event that morning was still enough to spook me. Spook me enough that I was willing to heed the figment of my imagination’s warning. Keeping in mind that tourists may well have gone missing here, I made sure to stay directly on the trail at all times – as though if I wondered out into the forest, I would be taken in an instant. \n\nWhat didn’t help with this anxiety was that Tyler, Chris and Brodie, quickly becoming bored of all the stopping and starting, suddenly pull out a football and start throwing it around amongst the jungle – zigzagging through the trees as though the trees were line-backers. They ask me and Hayley to play with them - but with the words of caution, given to me that morning still fresh in my mind, I politely decline the offer and remain firmly on the trail. Although I still wasn’t over what happened, constantly replaying the words like a broken record in my head, thankfully, it seemed as though for the rest of the day, nothing remotely as exciting was going to happen. But unfortunately... or more tragically... something did...  \n\nBy mid-afternoon, we had made progress further along the trail. The heat during the day was intense, but luckily by now, the skies above had blessed us with momentous rain. Seeping through the trees, we were spared from being soaked, and instead given a light shower to keep us cool. Yet again, Aaron and his crew stopped to film, and while they did, Tyler brought out the very same football and the three guys were back to playing their games. I cannot tell you how many times someone hurled the ball through the forest only to hit a tree-line-backer, whereafter they had to go forage for the it amongst the tropic floor. Now finding a clearing off-trail in which to play, Chris runs far ahead in anticipation of receiving the ball. I can still remember him shouting, ‘Brodie, hit me up! Hit me!’ Brodie hurls the ball long and hard in Chris’ direction, and facing the ball, all the while running further along the clearing, Chris stretches, catches the ball and... he just vanishes...  \n\nOne minute he was there, then the other, he was gone... Tyler and Brodie call out to him, but Chris doesn’t answer. Me and Hayley leave the trail towards them to see what’s happened - when suddenly we hear Tyler scream, ‘CHRIS!’... The sound of that initial scream still haunts me - because when we catch up to Brodie and Tyler, standing over something down in the clearing... we realize what has happened... \n\nWhat Tyler and Brodie were standing over was a hole. A 6-feet deep hole in the ground... and in that hole, was Chris. But we didn’t just find Chris trapped inside of the hole, because... It wasn’t just a hole. It wasn’t just a trap... It was a death trap... Chris was dead.  \n\nIn the hole with him was what had to be at least a dozen, long and sharp, rust-eaten metal spikes... We didn’t even know if he was still alive at first, because he had landed face-down... Face-down on the spikes... They were protruding from different parts of him. One had gone straight through his wrist – another out of his leg, and one straight through the right of his ribcage. Honestly, he... Chris looked like he was crucified... Crucified face-down. \n\nOnce the initial shock had worn off, Tyler and Brodie climb very quickly but carefully down into the hole, trying to push their way through the metal spikes that repelled them from getting to Chris. But by the time they do, it didn’t take long for them or us to realize Chris wasn’t breathing... One of the spikes had gone through his throat... For as long as I live, I will never be able to forget that image – of looking down into the hole, and seeing Chris’ lifeless, impaled body, just lying there on top of those spikes... It looked like someone had toppled over an idol... An idol of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ... when he was on the cross. \n\nWhat made this whole situation far worse, was that when Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles catch up to us, instead of being grieved or even shocked, Miles leans over the trap hole and instantly begins to film. Tyler and Brodie, upon seeing this were furious! Carelessly clawing their way out the hole, they yell and scream after him.  \n\n‘What the hell do you think you're doing?!’ \n\n‘Put the fucking camera away! That’s our friend!’ \n\nClimbing back onto the surface, Tyler and Brodie try to grab Miles’ camera from him, and when he wouldn’t let go, Tyler aggressively rips it from his hands. Coming to Miles’ aid, Aaron shouts back at them, ‘Leave him alone! This is a documentary!’ Without even a second thought, Brodie hits Aaron square in the face, breaking his glasses and knocking him down. Even though we were both still in extreme shock, hyperventilating over what just happened minutes earlier, me and Hayley try our best to keep the peace – Hayley dragging Brodie away, while I basically throw myself in front of Tyler.  \n\nOnce all of the commotion had died down, Tyler announces to everyone, ‘That’s it! We’re getting out of here!’ and by we, he meant the four of us. Grabbing me protectively by the arm, Tyler pulls me away with him while Brodie takes Hayley, and we all head back towards the trail in the direction we came.  \n\nThinking I would never see Sophie or the others again, I then hear behind us, ‘If you insist on going back, just watch out for mines.’ \n\n...Mines?  \n\nStopping in our tracks, Brodie and Tyler turn to ask what the heck Aaron is talking about. ‘16% of Vietnam is still contaminated by landmines and other explosives. 600,000 at least. They could literally be anywhere.’ Even with a potentially broken nose, Aaron could not help himself when it came to educating and patronizing others.  \n\n‘And you’re only telling us this now?!’ said Tyler. ‘We’re in the middle of the Fucking jungle! Why the hell didn’t you say something before?!’ \n\n‘Would you have come with us if we did? Besides, who comes to Vietnam and doesn’t fact-check all the dangers?! I thought you were travellers!’ \n\nIt goes without saying, but we headed back without them. For Tyler, Brodie and even Hayley, their feeling was if those four maniacs wanted to keep risking their lives for a stupid documentary, they could. We were getting out of here – and once we did, we would go straight to the authorities, so they could find and retrieve Chris’ body. We had to leave him there. We had to leave him inside the trap - but we made sure he was fully covered and no scavengers could get to him. Once we did that, we were out of there.  \n\nAs much as we regretted this whole journey, we knew the worst of everything was probably behind us, and that we couldn’t take any responsibility for anything that happened to Aaron’s team... But I regret not asking Sophie to come with us – not making her come with us... Sophie was a good person. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in all of this... None of us did. \n\nHurriedly making our way back along the trail, I couldn’t help but put the pieces together... In the same day an apparition warned me of the jungle’s surrounding dangers, Chris tragically and unexpectedly fell to his death... Is that what the soldier’s ghost was trying to tell me? Is that what he meant by Charlie? He wasn’t warning me of the enemy... He was trying to warn me of the relics they had left... Aaron said there were still 600,000 explosives left in Vietnam from the war. Was it possible there were still traps left here too?... I didn’t know... But what I did know was, although I chose to not believe what I saw that morning – that it was just a hallucination... I still heeded the apparition’s warning, never once straying off the trail... and it more than likely saved my life... \n\nThen I remembered why we came here... We came here to find what happened to the missing tourists... Did they meet the same fate as Chris? Is that what really happened? They either stepped on a hidden landmine or fell to their deaths? Was that the cause of the whole mystery? \n\nThe following day, we finally made our way out of the jungle and back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. We told the authorities what happened and a full search and rescue was undertaken to find Aaron’s team. A bomb disposal unit was also sent out to find any further traps or explosives. Although they did find at least a dozen landmines and one further trap... what they didn’t find was any evidence whatsoever for the missing tourists... No bodies. No clothing or any other personal items... As far as they were concerned, we were the first people to trek through that jungle for a very long time...  \n\nBut there’s something else... The rescue team, who went out to save Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles from an awful fate... They never found them... They never found anything... Whatever the Vietnam Triangle was... It had claimed them... To this day, I still can’t help but feel an overwhelming guilt... that we safely found our way out of there... and they never did. \n\nI don’t know what happened to the missing tourists. I don’t know what happened to Sophie, Aaron and the others - and I don’t know if there really are creatures lurking deep within the jungles of Vietnam... And although I was left traumatized, forever haunted by the experience... whatever it was I saw in that jungle... I choose to believe it saved my life... And for that reason, I have fully renewed my faith. \n\nTo this day, I’m still teaching English as a second language. I’m still travelling the world, making my way through one continent before moving onto the next... But for as long as I live, I will forever keep this testimony... Never again will I ever step inside of a jungle... \n\n...Never again. "},"95":{"title":"I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jm8mw8\/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never\/","flair":null,"author":"CosmicOrphan2020","selftext":"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  \n\nFeeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. \n\nThere were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. \n\nFortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  \n\nI was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   \n\nBiển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  \n\nAlongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. \n\nI haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  \n\nWhen I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. \n\nAs much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  \n\nI had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. \n\nOn one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  \n\nLater that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  \n\nThe four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. \n\nBy early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” \n\nBy that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. \n\nAlthough I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ \n\nIntroducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  \n\nSuddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ \n\nTaking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   \n\nWhatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ \n\nWithout saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  \n\n‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  \n\nFurther educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  \n\n‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ \n\nIf you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. \n\nFeeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ \n\nAaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  \n\n‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ \n\nAlthough I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  \n\n‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  \n\nLike I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ \n\nAs amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. \n\n‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  \n\nExpecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  \n\n‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ \n\n‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  \n\nHayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. \n\nAlthough Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. \n\nLater that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  \n\n‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ \n\nI’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. \n\nWe get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. \n\nAlthough we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  "},"96":{"title":"The tall man in my basement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jkctl9\/the_tall_man_in_my_basement\/","flair":null,"author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"The basement was cold and damp, the air thick and stale. He stood there, towering, his head nearly brushing the ceiling. His features were long and slender, limbs stretched unnaturally. His arms hung low, fingers almost grazing his knees. His legs, thin and bone-like, made him stand at an impossible 12 feet tall.\n\nHis mouth stretched wide — too wide — an unnatural stretched mouth that revealed nothing but a black void inside. His eyes, deep and hollow, were pits of endless darkness, a void that seemed to pull everything in.\n\nI don't remember how it got there or how it even got inside. All I know is I locked it deep in my basement where it couldn’t come out.\n\nWell, that was until I found the basement door wide open.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said, staring into the dark basement that yawned open before me. My voice felt small, swallowed by the shadows below.\n\nFear crawled up my throat, thick and sour, like I might throw it up. I slammed the door shut, my hands shaking.\n\nThen I heard it — soft, rattling noises from the kitchen. Gentle, deliberate, like something was moving in there.\n\nSomething was in the house with me.\n\nI moved deliberately, each step slow and careful, my breath caught in my throat. I watched my surroundings, making no noise as I crept toward the kitchen.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nThe creature from my basement stood at the sink, its towering frame hunched awkwardly beneath the ceiling. It stared out the window, motionless, its long, slender limbs hanging at its sides.\n\nIt didn’t move. It didn’t make a sound. It just stood there, like it belonged.\n\nMy heart slammed against my ribs as I bolted for the front door, feet barely touching the ground. I didn’t dare look back — I didn’t need to.\n\nThe roar came first, splitting the air like a thunderclap. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t animal. It was deep, raw, and wrong, vibrating through my bones, rattling my teeth. My legs nearly gave out from the sound alone, but fear shoved me forward.\n\nI hit the door hard, bursting into the cold night air. My car was just ahead, parked in the driveway. My keys — I needed my keys. My hand dove into my pocket, fingers trembling as I fumbled them out.\n\nBehind me, the door exploded open with a splintering crack. Heavy, unnatural footsteps pounded against the ground, fast — too fast. I didn’t have to see it to know it was coming. I could feel it closing the distance.\n\nI reached the car, yanked the door open, and threw myself inside. My hands shook so badly the keys slipped from my fingers and hit the floor mat.\n\n“No, no, no—”\n\nI grabbed them again, forcing the key into the ignition. The engine sputtered, coughed — the sound of death.\n\nThe creature lunged from the doorway, its long, bony limbs propelling it forward in a blur of twisted movement. It was nearly to the car.\n\nThe engine roared to life.\n\nI slammed the gear into reverse, tires squealing as I stomped the gas. The car jolted backward, throwing me against the seat as the creature lunged, just barely missing the hood. Its empty black eyes locked onto mine for a split second, burning into me before I peeled out of the driveway.\n\nI didn’t stop. My foot stayed pressed to the floor, the car flying down the long, dark street. The night swallowed everything around me, but I didn’t care where I was going — as long as it wasn’t back there.\n\nDays passed. I barely slept, holed up in a cheap hotel on the edge of town. The room smelled like old cigarettes and stale air, but it didn’t matter. It had four walls and a locked door.\n\nEvery night, I checked the window — just to be sure.\n\nThat night was no different. I pulled back the curtain, heart already racing before I even looked. The parking lot below was empty, streetlights flickering weakly against the dark. For a second, I let myself believe I was safe.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nBeyond the lot, past the stretch of cracked asphalt and the rusted chain-link fence, the woods began — thick, black trees rising like jagged teeth. And there, just at the edge where the trees met the night, it stood.\n\nThe tall, twisted figure.\n\nIt didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It only stared, watching me from the shadows.\n\nIt found me.\n\nIn an instant, I yanked the curtains shut, heart slamming against my ribs. My breath came in quick, shaky bursts. I sprinted to the door, peering through the peephole — nothing. The hallway outside was empty, still and quiet.\n\nI didn’t know how fast it was. I didn’t know how smart it was. But it found me.\n\nHours crawled by. The TV droned on in the background, some late-night sitcom I wasn’t paying attention to. I kept glancing at the window, half-expecting to see it again.\n\nThen came the knock.\n\nIt wasn’t loud, just a soft, deliberate tapping. My head snapped toward the door, dread sinking like a cold weight in my chest.\n\nWho the hell could that be?\n\nI slid off the bed, feet hitting the floor. Before I reached the door, I heard it — a voice.\n\n\"Hello... I need help. Help me. Help me... I need help. Help me.\"\n\nIt didn’t sound right. It was flat, robotic, like a bad recording played over and over. No emotion. No urgency.\n\nI froze. My throat tightened.\n\n\"If you don’t leave right now, I’m calling the police!\" I shouted, voice trembling.\n\nThe voice didn’t stop.\n\n\"Help me. I need help. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door.\"\n\nIt wasn’t even yelling — just that same lifeless, droning tone. That was the worst part. The calmness. Like it wasn’t asking. Like it was telling.\n\nMy hands fumbled for my phone. I dialed 911, fingers shaking so hard I almost hit the wrong numbers.\n\nThe voice stopped.\n\nMy stomach twisted. It was like it knew.\n\nThe operator answered. I explained everything — the voice, the knocking, the thing in the woods. My words tumbled out fast, frantic.\n\n“We’ll send someone,” they said. “But it might take a few hours.”\n\nA few hours.\n\nMy heart sank. My hand shook so badly the phone nearly slipped from my ear.\n\nI didn’t hang up. I didn’t move.\n\nI just stared at the door, waiting.\n\nOut of fear, I asked, “Could you… could you just stay on the line until they come? I don’t want to be alone.”\n\nAt first, she hesitated. “I’m sorry, sir. We can’t do that. We have to answer other calls—”\n\n“Please,” I cut in, my voice trembling. “Please. I—I don’t think I’ll make it if I’m alone.”\n\nThere was a pause. I could hear her breathing on the other end. Then, quietly, she said, “Okay. I’ll stay.”\n\nRelief washed over me, but it didn’t chase the fear away. My eyes stayed locked on the door.\n\nHer voice was calm, gentle. “My name’s Rachel. What’s your name?”\n\nI swallowed hard. “It’s... it’s James.”\n\n“Alright, James. I’m here with you. You’re not alone.”\n\nMy throat tightened. “Thank you. I… I think it’s still out there.”\n\n“Can you still hear the voice?” she asked softly.\n\nI shook my head, even though she couldn’t see me. “No. It stopped when I called you. But… the way it sounded—” I paused, shuddering at the memory. “It wasn’t normal. It was like… robotic. Repeating itself over and over.”\n\nRachel was quiet for a moment, then said, “You’re doing great, James. Just stay with me. The officers are on their way.”\n\nI nodded again, trying to steady my breathing. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the quiet wasn’t a good thing.\n\nIt felt like the calm before something worse.\n\nRachel’s voice came through the phone again, steady but a little more serious.\n\n“James… who’s chasing you? Can you describe them?”\n\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My throat felt tight, like the words got stuck halfway up.\n\n“I… I don’t know,” I said finally. It wasn’t a lie — not really. “It’s tall. Really tall. Its arms are… too long. Its mouth…” My voice trailed off. My mind replayed that black void, the hollow eyes. My stomach twisted.\n\n“Too long?” Rachel asked gently. “James, are you saying it’s someone wearing a mask or—”\n\n“No,” I cut in, my voice cracking. “It’s not a mask. It’s not… human.”\n\nThe line went quiet for a moment. I heard her breathe in.\n\n“James,” she said slowly, carefully, “are you sure? Could it be someone in a costume, maybe? Sometimes, when we’re scared, our minds—”\n\n“I know what I saw!” I snapped, louder than I meant to. My voice echoed off the hotel walls, and I flinched at how desperate I sounded.\n\nRachel didn’t react. She stayed calm. “Okay. I believe you. You’re doing great, James. Just stay with me, alright? The officers are still on their way.”\n\nMy chest felt tight, like I couldn’t get a full breath. My eyes stayed locked on the door.\n\nI couldn’t tell her the truth — not all of it. If I said a monster crawled out of my basement and followed me to a hotel, they’d think I lost my mind. Maybe I had.\n\nBut the thing outside? The voice? It wasn’t in my head.\n\nIt was real.\n\nAnd it wasn’t gone.\n\nAn hour passed in what felt like seconds. The room was still, but I couldn’t escape the feeling that something was wrong. My pulse thudded in my ears, every breath a battle against the rising panic. Rachel’s voice kept me tethered to reality, her calm words a thread I clung to.\n\nThen, suddenly, a knock at the door.\n\nKnock Knock\n\nI froze. The hairs on my neck stood up.\n\n“Hello, this is the police. Open the door. This is the police. Open the door.”\n\nA wave of relief flooded through me. I wasn’t alone. Finally. The officers were here.\n\nI rushed to the door, heart pounding in my chest. I glanced at my phone to make sure I hadn’t missed anything, and there it was — the call still connected, Rachel’s voice as steady as ever.\n\n“James, stay calm. They’re on their way.”\n\nI could hear the muffled voice of the “officer” outside, repeating the same line. The door was within reach. I grabbed the handle, yanked it open, ready to let in the safety of the police.\n\nBut there it stood.\n\nThe creature.\n\nIt towered, its limbs unnaturally long, bent in sickening angles. Its black, empty eyes locked onto mine. The grin that stretched across its face was wide and chilling — too wide.\n\nI looked down at my phone in my trembling hands. The screen read:\n\n“911. What’s your emergency?”\n\nA smile twisted across the creature’s face. It wasn’t the officer. It never was.\n\nI staggered back, my blood running cold. My stomach dropped into a pit of icy dread.\n\nAnd then it hit me. Rachel never asked for my location.\n\nI had never been on the phone with the police.\n\nI had been talking to it. God help me.\n\n"},"97":{"title":"My tinder date slept at my house.

I glance at my screen and see a new message. The sender’s name is nothing more than a jumble of numbers—“202200668”—an anonymous code that offers no hint of identity. The email’s body contains a single, stark question:\n\n“is anyone there?”\n\nI sit there, staring at those three simple words, as if they were a lifeline thrown into the void. For a long, silent hour, I let that question echo in my mind, each moment stretching out in the dim light of my solitary apartment. Just as I begin to accept the silence as my only answer, the chime rings again. My inbox refreshes, and another email appears—again from a sender identified solely by a string of numbers. This time, the message is longer, a raw, trembling plea:\n\n“if anyone’s out there, please… help me.”\n\nThe words strike me like a cold wave. I lean closer to the screen, my heart pounding, as I try to grasp the urgency behind that plea. In that moment, I’m left with nothing but the stark emptiness of an unanswered call—a quiet reminder that even in the unyielding routine of my days, a solitary question persists in the silence. A week later… A week later the person behind 202200668 sent another message:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n“March 15, 2977 – 6:00 PM I wake up, and everything is... wrong. No noise. No wind. No warmth. Just stillness—so absolute that it feels like the whole world has forgotten how to breathe. I find myself in a house—neither mine nor anyone else’s—a solitary structure on a road that leads nowhere, beneath a sky stripped of sun, stars, or moon; only an endless gray remains. In those early hours, as I stepped forward, I noticed the uncanny perfection of this place. I jumped, and there was no impact—no pain, no weariness. My body moved with a limitless energy, as if this cycle was designed to defy all natural laws. For one week, I battled against this unyielding loop. I tested the limits of pain, starved myself, and even attempted to shatter the very fabric of my surroundings. Each act of defiance was met with a flawless restoration—the shattered glass mended, the burning embers snuffed out, and the memories wiped clean with the dawn. In my futile struggle, I documented every anomaly, every detail that whispered of the illusion hiding behind this relentless routine. If someone is out there please help me , here’s what I did in the last week or so I believe . “  \n\\----  \nThe following details are what he knows about that place and what he did which all of this are marked “ failed “ then at the bottom here’s what it said “- I will cease my attempts. But if, by some miracle, my plan works, then you might not receive another message from me again. It will be a silence that signals your liberation. I remember the last clear moment before all of this: I woke up one day to discover that it was 1978. May these words be a lifeline, a guide for holding onto yourself amid the illusion.” —202200668.\n\n\\----  \nI sit in the dim light of my apartment, the glow of my laptop screen casting long, wavering shadows across the room. My hands are still trembling from reading the email—a message that feels both impossibly ancient and heartbreakingly personal. For a long, heavy moment, I simply stare, as if trying to imprint every word onto my memory before it can fade away like all the rest. My mind reels. The diary entry is a mirror reflecting a past I never lived, yet every detail resonates. I close my eyes, and I’m suddenly back in that desolate house described by this person—a place of endless gray and unyielding stillness. His words, his desperate attempts to defy the cycle, echo inside me, a mix of anger and sorrow. I remember the daily rituals of my own life—the meticulous, sterile repetition—and I can’t help but wonder if I’ve been living a lie, just as he did. I open my notebook, the pages trembling beneath my pen. Keep a record, trust your instincts, guard your identity. His advice is both a lifeline and a challenge. In that moment, my thoughts swirl: Is it possible that my daily defiance, my quiet observations, are not just anomalies but pieces of a greater truth? The idea gnaws at me. Every glitch, every odd reset—even the vanishing email itself—now carries a weight I can no longer ignore. A surge of bitter determination courses through me. I feel the sting of loneliness and the burden of knowing that someone before me once fought this relentless cycle, only to ultimately resign himself to silence. The words, “if these efforts fail… I will cease my attempts,” cut deep, a prophecy of despair that I refuse to accept.\n\n. I lean back in my chair, letting the gravity of his words sink in, and in that quiet solitude, I make a decision. I will keep a record. I will trust my instincts and guard every fragment of my true self against this oppressive, unyielding pattern. For the first time in a long time, I feel both fear and hope—a dangerous, electrifying cocktail that propels me forward. In the silence of the night, I whisper to the empty room, “I’m still here, and I’m not giving up.” This person’s words may have been written in resignation, but mine will be written in defiance. I stare at the screen, where the final line of the email blurs in the soft light, and I know that, even if the cycle resets again tomorrow, something inside me has irrevocably changed. Tonight, the spark of rebellion has been ignited.\n\nMarch 23, – 8:30 AM – At work, everything is as expected. My chair creaks as I sit, my inbox is filled with routine reports, and the fluorescent lights hum softly overhead. I let the repetition wash over me, trying to ground myself. But then, it happens. I turn my head—just a quick glance out the office window—and for a split second, I see it. A gray sky. No buildings, no city. Just a vast, empty horizon stretching endlessly. And a figure. Sitting outside a solitary house. Motionless. Still. My stomach twists. The sight vanishes as quickly as it appeared, and the cityscape snaps back into place. Glass towers. Blinding LED billboards. The hum of distant traffic. Normal. I blink rapidly, my fingers digging into my desk. No. No, that wasn’t real. It was exhaustion. A trick of the light. But the image is burned into my mind—the empty sky, the endless gray, and the person sitting in front of the house, unmoving. Defiant. I exhale sharply, forcing my hands to steady. Ignore it. Just focus. But as I lower my gaze, my breath catches in my throat. My reflection. It’s in the window, just like it should be. But for a single, unbearable second—it doesn’t move with me. I swallow hard, forcing myself to breathe. My hands are cold, my pulse too fast. This isn’t my mind playing tricks on me. The email. The diary. His purgatory. The figure. This is real. I push away from my desk, needing air, needing something to confirm that I’m still in control.\n\nAs I walk down the hallway toward the bathroom, the fluorescent lights flicker once, then again. The hum in the ceiling stutters, like a failing signal struggling to hold on. I place my hands under the cold water, splashing my face. The mirror fogs slightly from the temperature change. I brace myself, exhaling slowly. I look up. And my reflection… is still looking down. A second passes. Then it snaps up, meeting my gaze. I stumble back, my breath catching. The mirror is normal now. Everything is normal. But I know better. Something otherworldly is happening. I stand frozen in the dim glow of the bathroom lights, my breath shallow, my hands still damp from the water. The mirror is normal now—just a reflection, a perfect mimicry of me. But I can’t shake the feeling that for a brief, unbearable moment, it had been something else. Something separate. I glance toward the door. Outside, I can hear the faint, predictable rhythm of the office beyond—keyboards clicking, muted voices, the hum of a world that refuses to acknowledge its cracks. But I saw it. The gray horizon. The house. And him. The figure. Sitting completely still outside the house, just as the described in his email. Not moving. Not blinking. Not reacting. Just waiting. The realization churns in my stomach. Is it really him? How long has he been sitting there? I press a trembling hand against my forehead, trying to steady myself. I need to test something. I take out my phone, flipping to the camera. If something is wrong with my reflection, maybe the screen will catch it. I angle it toward the mirror, hesitating before looking. Nothing. Just me, looking back. I swallow the lump in my throat and quickly put my phone away. Stay calm. Stay in control. With one last breath, I push open the bathroom door and step back into the office.\n\nThe moment I walk back to my desk, I notice something strange. Everyone is in the exact same position as when I left. Exactly. The guy across from me—his fingers frozen just above the keyboard, mid-press. The woman two desks away—her coffee cup hovering an inch from her lips. The hum of conversation and office noise has been perfectly preserved, unmoving. Like a paused video. My pulse spikes. I stand there for what feels like an eternity, waiting for something—anything—to move. Then, as if a switch has been flipped, the office snaps back to life. Keys clack. Phones ring. Conversations resume, smooth and unbroken. I whip my head around, searching for any sign that someone else noticed. But no one reacts. They continue with their routines, faces blank, oblivious. I grip the edge of my desk, forcing air into my lungs. The world lagged. Or maybe… maybe it was resetting. I glance at my screen. My inbox is open, but I barely see the words. I can still feel the weight of the figure outside the house, things that I should never have seen. He sat there for an eternity, refusing to move, refusing to play along. If he's still there, does that mean he’s still waiting? Or worse… Has he been trapped in that moment since the day he stopped fighting? The thought makes my skin crawl. I need answers. The world glitched. I saw him. He’s still there. The city moves around me in its usual rhythm, but something feels different. The weight I felt earlier, the subtle resistance—it’s stronger now. The world is aware. It knows I know. I keep walking, testing my surroundings with every step.\n\nThe people around me move perfectly, their motions fluid, their conversations effortless. But now, I see the cracks. A man in a suit walks past me, talking on his phone. I focus on him, narrowing my eyes. His words are exactly the same as yesterday. Same rhythm. Same inflection. I stop walking. He passes me. A few seconds later, another man in the same suit walks by. Same phone. Same words. Exact same tone. I turn my head sharply, watching him disappear into the crowd. The world is repeating itself. I check my phone again. 8:48 AM. I look up at a digital billboard—it still says 8:46 AM. The glitch is getting worse.\n\n  \n(Part 4 coming soon.) The world is breaking faster than I am."},"99":{"title":"what is happening in my cottage?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1jis6v8\/what_is_happening_in_my_cottage\/","flair":null,"author":"CobblerResident3072","selftext":"IM 16 YEARS OLD GIRL, AND THIS HAPPENED TO ME WHILE I WAS 8..\n\nSO..THE SCHOOL WAS OVER,IT WAS SUMMER BREAK, AND ME AND MY PARENTS DECIDED TO GO TO OUR COTTAGE. im not saying where it is, personal reasons..

I found it while looking for a game to occupy myself during a 6-hour flight, and against all odds, I got hooked to it.\n\nI’m not much of a ‘gamer’, unless you count Candy Crush, but for some reason this game really drew me in. All the options and unique scenarios just kept me coming back for more. \n\nMy first ‘Bitlife’ died as a mid-level salesman. The next was a famous musician. The one after was a notorious serial killer. Every new ‘bitlife’ was different, and every one more interesting than the next.\n\nOne day, I was lying on my couch, sipping on a vitamin water as my latest bitlife lived out his final years. He was a very successful CEO, married to his partner for 40 years, and was the loving adopted father of two boys.\n\nThe black ‘death’ screen popped up, as I aged him up one last time.\n\n“*Gary Newell died at the age of 82.*”\n\n“*He passed away peacefully in his sleep.*”\n\nI let out a satisfied sigh. Gary lived a very fulfilling, very successful life. I took another sip of my water, letting the silence of my apartment envelop me for a few moments. \n\nI checked the time. 9:18 p.m. Enough time for me to start a new life.\n\nI clicked the little sperm icon to start again. My phone froze, the screen becoming unresponsive for a few seconds. Frustrated, I locked and unlocked the screen to try to get it to work again.\n\nIt flickered back to life, the app opening again. \n\nI gasped as double-checked the new name. \n\n“*Rita Thatcher*”. \n\nThe exact same name as me!\n\nI let out a laugh, trying to imagine what the chances are that the random name would be mine!\n\nI decided I was gonna give little Rita the best life possible. Make her a CEO, or a famous painter. Maybe even a movie star.\n\nFeeling excited, I took a look at the information screen.\n\n“*I was born a female in Glasgow, UK.*”\n\nMy eyes went wide as I double-checked the location. I was born in Glasgow. \n\nMy excitement slowly faded to a dull sense of dread as I continued to read.\n\n“*Born 28 November.*” Same day as me.\n\nThe feeling of dread grew as I read the names of the parents. \n\n\"*David Thatcher, writer. (age 29)*\"\n\"*Willow Thatcher, police officer. (age 27)*\"\n\nThose are my parents names. \n\nMy dad was a writer, and my mom was a police officer back in those days. I quickly did the math, and the ages also matched. \n\nWith shaking hands, I clicked \"Age up\". \n\n\"*Age: 1 year. My mother and father had a baby boy named Jenson.*\"\n\nMy blood turned to ice as I read the text again. \n\n\"No way.\" I said to myself over and over, unable to believe that this is really happening. My stomach wrenched itself into knots as I thought of my poor, sweet brother. \n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\nNothing showed up for Age 2 and 3. With each blank screen, the feeling of dread that sat inside me eased up just a little. I tried to imagine what the odds of all this being a coincidence was. Probably impossibly low. \n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age 4: your parents want to buy you and your brother a pet spaniel named Daphne!*\" \n\nI let out a shriek as I dropped my phone and scrambled to the other side of the couch. I fell off the edge, my butt hitting the cold, tiled floor. \n\nI sat there for a bit, curled up and taking deep breaths. I remembered Daphne's sweet, brown eyes and golden coat. My parents got her for Jenson and I when I was four. She was my sweet angel, my best friend for five years. \n\nI sat on the floor for a few seconds more, as the weight in my stomach eased up enough for me to get up. I went to the kitchen, grabbed a glass from the cabinet and poured myself some water. \n\nI leaned against the counter, taking slow sips as the feeling of dread faded little by little. \n\nI placed the empty glass in the sink and turned the hot water on, grabbing the sponge and dish soap as the water heated up. Still in a daze, I cleaned the glass, rinsing off the suds and placing it on the rack to dry. \n\nI think I'm just tired. Overworked and delusional from working a double shift. I'll just turn off the game and go to bed. \n\nI jumped as a 'Ping!' sounded from the lounge. It's my phone, letting me know I had a message. \n\nI made my way to the lounge, sitting back on the couch as I picked up my phone and glanced at its screen. \n\nBitlife was still open, it's text waiting patiently for me as I swiped down and checked the notification. \n\nIt was from Bitlife. \"*Don't leave just yet!*\" it said. \n\n\"You must be losing your mind, Rita.\" I told myself, as I clicked \"Age up\", bracing myself for whatever came next. \n\n\"It's just a game.\" I tried to tell myself. It didn't help. \n\n\"*Age: 6 years. My dad is now addicted to alcohol.*\"\n\nI tried to lock the phone, my hands fumbling over the button over and over in a panic. The screen refused to lock, the text becoming blurry as I started to cry. \n\nIn frustration, I threw my phone across the room. It gave a loud **Crack!** as it bounced against the wall, it's screen ripping off and hanging from the main body. \n\nThe phone started pinging. Slowly at first, but picking up speed until it became a torrent of noise. \n\nMechanically, I made my way over to it, delicately picking up the screen as its cabling snapped off and left the main body behind. \n\nImpossibly, notifications flooded across the top of its lit screen. \"Don't leave just yet, Rita!\" it said, all from Bitlife. I watched as they flickered by. \n\nSuddenly they stopped, one final message popping up from the Text app. \n\nIt was from my dad. \n\n\"*Keep playing, Rita.*\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 7 years. My brother Jenson died at the age of 6.*\"\n\nMy eyesight became more blurry as tears flowed down my face. \n\n\"*He died in a car crash.*\"\n\nMy dad was driving that car. He picked him up from nursery school and was on his way to pick me up from my school when it happened. It was a head-on collision. \n\nThe police found my dad over the limit, and halfway across the other lane. \n\nAnother notification, this time from my mom. \n\n\"*Keep going!*\" \n\nNumbly, I clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 8 years. My mom died at the age of 35.*\"\n\nThe phones speakers came to life from the other side of the room, giving me a start. Two voices flooded out of it. \n\nIt's been years, but I recognized my parent's voices. \n\nIt started out hushed, both of them whispering to each other so as to not wake little Rita. Soon the voices grew louder and louder, filling the living room as they screamed angrily at each other. \n\nI cupped my ears, trying to drown out the sounds. It grew louder, the noise filling the room until I screamed, trying to drown them out. \n\nSuddenly it stopped. A door slammed and the sound of heavy footsteps marched away. \n\nI heard someone open a kitchen drawer, the utensils clanging together inside it as someone rifled around. \n\nThey pulled something out, slamming the drawer shut as they made their way back to where they came. \n\nI heard another 'Ping!' come from my phone. \n\n\"*She was stabbed by my father during an argument.*\" \n\nThe screaming turned my blood to ice. \n\nIt started off loud and shrill, the sound reverberating throughout the house. It started becoming hoarse and choked, before cutting off to a gargling silence. \n\nI cupped my hands over my ears, dropping the screen as I curled into a ball. \n\nI began screaming, telling it to stop as the sounds of my dad's labored breathing joined the sounds of his knife. \n\nSuddenly it cut off with another 'Ping!'. As my vision returned, I looked up at the screen. \n\n\"*Keep playing, Rita.*\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 9 years. My father committed suicide in prison at age 38. I've been sent to an orphanage.*\"\n\nI clicked again. \"Age up.\"\n\n\"*Age: 13 years.

Now out here we have no neighbors, the closest place to my house is about 8 miles away. I always loved living out here because I've always liked the seclusion and the road we live by is always dead at night, which makes for good sleep. Now my aunt is always working the night shift. So this means I would be home alone pretty much every night. Long story short I came home from school on a relatively crappy day, thunderstorms and rain all day and all night and spent my day playing video games and snapchatting my friends. At about 9 o'clock my aunt came upstairs and told me she was heading off to her job. I was always fine with this because I liked being home alone, I had full range of the house and could play loud music all I wanted. Who wouldn’t love it? At about 11 o'clock I had started feeling tired and laid down to watch some youtube and go to sleep. And soon enough, I did. I woke up at some odd hour of the night to somebody knocking on the door. I sat up and muttered, “What the hell?” I thought my aunt had got home from the night shift and reluctantly went to go answer the door and out of habit, checked the window beside the door to make sure it was her. But there was nobody there. I thought to myself “Probably some stupid kids knocking on my door and running away.” And I dismissed it at that and went back into my room. I checked my phone to realize it was 3 am and the thought of teenagers ding dong ditching my home was suddenly out of the question given that it was a Wednesday, and I basically lived in the middle of nowhere. Just as I was thinking I heard a bang coming from the basement. I jumped and tried to make up an excuse like a noise of the thunderstorm to calm me down. We always kept our basement door locked anyway out of my aunt's paranoia and fear of someone breaking in. That's when I heard footsteps slowly creaking up the old wooden stairs in my basement. Frozen with fear I grabbed my phone and called 911. The operator told me to go to an upstairs room in the house and grab a weapon to defend myself. But there was no way I was going to grab a knife from the kitchen, especially when I heard the door being slammed and quickly realized that someone was trying to bust it down. I jumped from my bed and closed my door quietly and hid in my closet like the 911 operator had told me to do. This was easily the scariest moment of my life but suddenly, the banging stopped. But what comes next will haunt me for my whole life. Whoever it was screamed at the top of their lungs. But it wasn’t a normal scream, it was an insane and disgruntled scream. And then, I heard the basement door collapse. Now he was full out screaming as he sprinted up the stairs. He went through all the rooms down the upstairs hallway (still screaming) until he reached mine. My door, unfortunately, didn’t have a lock on it and when I heard him open my door, I was paralyzed with fear. I could see him through the shades of my closet, he was still screaming, looking all over my room, even under my bed. But then after trying to hold my breath for too long, I let out a puff of air. He perked up, looked straight at my closet and slowly walked towards it, no longer screaming. I couldn’t even breathe at the moment. Especially when he just stopped right in front of the closet door. I could see him through the closet. And he had the biggest smile I had ever seen. As soon as he slowly reached for the closet door knob, there was a loud bang at the door and somebody yelling “Police!” The man quickly ran and tried to run out my window but failed. As soon as I saw the police tackle him I instantly ran out of the closet and outside (now realizing that was a stupid move on my part). After a couple of minutes I saw the police bring the man out in cuffs but on the way to the car, he stared at me with the biggest smile and the craziest eyes I had ever seen. Watching him ride away with the police was the greatest moment of my life. But, what still haunts me today, is the face he made as he was standing in front of my closet door, ready to do something horrible."},"215":{"title":"Please Read Before Posting!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/7b31h8\/please_read_before_posting\/","flair":null,"author":"YugiohKing","selftext":"Hello Horror Story Readers!

I was 23. \n\nWhile most of my friends and co-workers could go to college or party on the weekends, I was caught in a jail of long hours and tight budgets. An even more frustrating lifestyle since I lived in a vibrant bigger city like Columbus, Georgia. I could never hit the bars or Hell, just go out and meet hot guys. The fun with Julian became my only breaks from this stressful working-class prison sentence.\n\nBut still. I tried. Even through my binge-eating and drinking, I stayed at an average weight. While I may have been forced to mature beyond my years, my looks hadn't caught up with my \"old\" mindset. I was still a pretty young woman. I had nice cheekbones accompanied by a pair of sultry lips. My eyes big and radiant. Whenever I had the time, I'd even work out or straighten my long black hair. Only those moments were few and far between while I was in nursing... Yet somehow, I persevered. I dressed well without being boujee. I was strong and independent without being a ratchet bitch. I stayed friendly and optimistic regardless of my fading sanity.\n\nAnd then finally, it happened. I got the callback. A job offer to go somewhere higher than this Hell. I was gonna be a 911 call taker. As crazy as it sounds, the schedule would be less draining. The pay much better. And working for the Columbus Police Department meant I'd get all sorts of benefits. Not to mention the chance to grow through various promotions. \n\nOf course, I knew this was gonna be stressful. I'd heard all the horror stories from both former call takers I knew and from the literal horror stories I'd seen on Reddit. But I had to think of Julian. I'd now have more time with him. Less time being underpaid, angry, and fucking tired. Chrysta Heyes could now *live*.\n\nThe only problem was training. This shit was gonna take eight weeks. Eight weeks stuck in a classroom. Monday through Friday, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. Obviously, I wanted to be prepared before being thrown to the snarling wolves assaulting our 911 hotlines. But shit, it was boring! We had to go over countless textbooks, all the protocols, even take a crash course in CPR. Not to mention the hours and hours of \"role play.\" \n\nLike a dull drama class full of amateur hacks, my classmates and I took turns playing caller and call taker. I guess it made for an easy thirteen bucks an hour. But mentally, this became an unbearable test for our patience.\n\nAfter a month or so, these dress rehearsals finally led to opening night. On Friday, we'd be taking calls for the very first time. Live calls. I was excited but nervous. Hell, all of us were.\n\nLike soldiers prepping for war, me and the other four trainees arrived at eight A.M. sharp. Our classroom was lower than the police station's first floor. A literal \"basement.\" A dimly-lit hallway took us past clunker vending machines and straight to this bunker of a 911 Center. Nothing but cold air all around us.\n\nOur instructor Ms. Wilder had already given us a tour during our first week. On one end of the Center was the 911 floor itself: a series of cubicles full of huge monitors and computer screens. An arena that veered between Wall Street histrionics and 9-to-5 monotony. There were no windows, no joy. The lighting appropriate for a clinical lab... as was the mood. When the calls were coming, the workers went into a pissy frenzy. And when the calls died, things looked agonizing. Boring. Within those bland gray walls, the call Center was the doldrums of the Columbus Police Department. \n\nTwo double doors separated this torturous telethon from the rest of the 911 Center. From our classroom.\n\nRight now, I counted about seven middle-aged and exhausted people working the lines. Two call takers, four dispatchers, and a really obnoxious female supervisor. She was an overweight slob of a woman. Then again, the vast majority of the employees here were overweight. We'd all been told it was an inevitable side effect of the job.\n\nBut my classmates and I still had to endure another month of training. Yeah, we'd be answering calls. \"Supervised calls.\" But hey, it beat having to do terrible role playing or memorize countless run codes.\n\nSo there we were in the cramped classroom. A claustrophobic space of old tables, cheap CPR dummies, and a whiteboard. There were no windows. No escape. The closed door kept us trapped in our own little world. Like stranded explorers around a campfire, us five trainees stayed close to the portable heater. Our only solace from the unrelenting cold.\n\nMs. Wilder and her assistant Kelly stood by the front desk. Right by the large laptop. Our 911 manual sat beside the laptop. The manual our \"script\" for the variety of upcoming emergencies we were about to face. Its withered pages older than stone tablets.\n\nI sat near my classmates. There was Tania, a pretty black girl in her early 20s. Her and I went to high school together and Tania was still just as charming, loud, and petite as she was then. Her flamboyant clothes only matched by her colorful claw-like fingernails. Then there was Abby, the only one of us who was married. A tall, plus-size blonde with glasses and sarcasm to spare. Her studying and immense knowledge at this job put us all to shame... even the instructors. \n\nAt 18, Catherine was the youngest out of us. She was a brunette with a thick Southern accent. I thought she played dumber than she really was... or at least, I thought she was just trying to be funny... And finally, there was Patrick, the only guy in the class. One of two guys in the entire 911 Center. Patrick was funny and cute... and pretty weird as well. Scrawny with green eyes, his morbid humor threw everyone off. Then again, he was also a horror writer and from what I understood, even posted on Reddit. Given the lack of men out here, I could tell the thirstier, middle-aged female call takers constantly kept their hungry eyes on him. He was also 27 and older than the rest of us. Hell, I think he even had a degree... so who the fuck knows how he ended up here.\n\nOur instructors were cool for the most part. The stickler was Ms. Wilder, an older black lady with glasses and hair strewn about all over the place. But she respected us and we respected her kind but authoritative style. Like a veteran sergeant, she'd experienced her fair share of war stories on those phone lines. And this was going back to when they didn't use computers...\n\nOn the other hand, Kelly was a little younger. More hip. A blonde Southern Belle with a pleasant attitude and face. And yeah, we walked all over her like high school rebels on a sweet substitute teacher.\n\nBut right now, us five trainees were sitting in nervous anticipation. Awaiting our death sentence of a first call. Under Ms. Wilder and Kelly's watchful eyes, this would be our first taste of the call taker life.\n\nClinging to my headset, I stole a look at my classmates's restless faces. For once, we weren't even shooting the shit at eight A.M. Not with the battlefield looming before us.\n\nMs. Wilder checked the laptop one more time. She hit the touchpad and stepped back. The laptop's screen and lights beamed to life.\n\n\"Alrighty,\" she said in a strong tone. Ms. Wilder confronted the class. Playing her right-hand man, Kelly tried to emulate Ms. Wilder's strict gaze.\n\n\"Who's first?\" Ms. Wilder challenged us.\n\nStaying quiet, we avoided eye contact with this firing squad. And our fate.\n\nSilent tension dominated the room. Ms. Wilder's wicked smile vanished.\n\nBattling my anxiety, I thought about taking one for the team. After all, it's not like I could forever avoid confronting that call...\n\nBut right when I was about to step up, Ms. Wilder fixated her on Tania. \"You first, Tania,\" Ms. Wilder said in a staunch tone. Our instructor was back in drill sergeant mode...\n\nGroaning, Tania stood up and walked toward the laptop. Her and I exchanged weary smile.\n\n\"You got it, girl,\" I quipped.\n\n\"Man, I hope!\" Tania exclaimed.\n\nKelly guided Tania to the desk. Plugged in Tania's headset.\n\nWatching over them like a self-serious stupidvisor, Ms. Wilder motioned toward the manual. \"Just remember you can use that anytime.\"\n\nThe words didn't exactly encourage Tania. She flashed me an anguished look.\n\n\"We'll be right here,\" Ms. Wilder went on.\n\n\"Oh Lord...\" Tania said through the nerves.\n\nMy classmates and I couldn't help but chuckle. At least we weren't gonna be the *first* guinea pig. Poor Tania.\n\nLeaning in toward Tania, Kelly pointed at the screen. \"Okay, your call's coming in there. Click it and you'll follow the script.\n\n\"Okay,\" Tania said.\n\n\"We'll hear everything so don't be nervous.\"\n\nTania's trembling hands put on the headset. She smiled at me. \"Ooh, child!\"\n\n\"You got the volume up, right?\" Ms. Wilder asked Kelly.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Kelly replied as she backed away from the desk.\n\nCurious, Catherine looked toward Ms. Wilder. \"Is it busy today?\"\n\nMs. Wilder gave her a mischievous smile. \"Oh, it will be. Trust me.\"\n\nLike an Apocalyptic alarm, a ringing phone blared through the room. Straight from the laptop.\n\nThe sound jolted Tania into a frenzy. \"Oh Jesus!\" she shouted.\n\n\"Answer it!\" Ms. Wilder said.\n\nRecovering fast, Tania's focus overtook her goofy charm. She clicked on the call.\n\nStatic blared off the laptop's speakers. Like a lost signal on the radio, everything was white noise.\n\nUnease crossed Tania's face. \"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\"\n\nJust a sea of static greeted her. Wave after wave of mechanical screams.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Tania repeated.\n\nNothing. The steady static sliced through the air... I thought I could even hear faint footsteps through the noise. Even faint voices.\n\n\"Keep going,\" Ms. Wilder commanded Tania.\n\nTania kept her eyes on the screen. \"Columbus 911-\"\n\nA sudden click cut her off. A hollow dial tone blared like a heart monitor's flatline.\n\nDefeated, Tania just shook her head. \"Ooh, child...\"\n\n\"No, you did good!\" Ms. Wilder reassured her.\n\nThrough the fear, Tania snatched off the headset.\n\n\"Definitely,\" Kelly added.\n\nMs. Wilder faced the rest of us. \"Just remember, never hang up!\"\n\nTania cracked a nervous smile. \"Whoo, I was about to! That shit weirded me out!\"\n\nKeeping her scholarly seriousness, Ms. Wilder faced her. \"Well, those kind of calls happen all the time, so you better get used to them.\"\n\nPatrick was next. He wasn't eager to say the least. Even his wacky coolness morphed into anxiety once he put on that headset.\n\nI flashed him a reassuring smile. He just offered me his cute grin. And an awkward laugh.\n\nOverbearing as always, Ms. Wilder stayed right on him. \"Now just use the manual if you have to.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Patrick said.\n\nTania gave me a light punch on the arm. \"You ready?\" she teased.\n\n\"Not at all, girl!\" I replied.\n\n\"Man, you got this!\" She looked over at Patrick. \"You better answer that call, Patrick!\"\n\nPatrick smirked. \"I'll try.\"\n\nAnother ring interrupted us.\n\n\"Okay,\" Patrick said, trying to calm himself. \n\nBut those rings were painful shocks to us newbies. Even when we weren't the ones answering, the rest of us stayed nervous. After all, we'd grown close over the course of the training. A call taker commune.\n\nPatrick forced himself to answer. \"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" he asked with the memorized mechanical tone we'd all mastered for that opening question.\n\nAn even more turbulent static rang out. Patrick cringed at the sound. Hell, we all did.\n\nThe concert of hissing continued. Loud and disorienting.\n\nAggravated, Tania covered her ears. \"Damn, girl! What is that!\"\n\nBut to me, there was no doubt. This had to be the same caller. I could hear the same movement in the background. Those same low, muffled voices. The same fizzles and pops through those sonic shrieks.\n\n\"911 Columbus, what's the address of your emergency?\" Patrick said in a nervous stutter.\n\nMs. Wilder leaned in toward the laptop. \"Is that the same number?\"\n\n\"No-\"\n\nA dial tone overtook the mysterious call. The otherworldly sounds ceased. Just like that, it was over.\n\nConfused, we all watched Patrick slide off his headset.\n\nAbby forced a smile. \"Who was that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Patrick said.\n\nPlayful, Tania confronted Ms Wilder. \"What's going on, Ms. Wilder? That's two of them now!\"\n\n\"Is the connection working?\" Catherine asked.\n\nLike a politician fending off a barrage of questions, Ms. Wilder waved us off. \"Trust me, it's normal. You're gonna get weird calls like that.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Patrick joked.\n\n\"Oh yeah, she's right,\" Kelly added. Her unwavering support of Ms. Wilder still oh so extra.\n\nNot missing a beat, Ms. Wilder turned her attention to Patrick. \"But you didn't hang up. That's good. Remember to never-\"\n\n\"Never hang up,\" Tania playfully finished.\n\nMs. Wilder just gave her a weak smile. \"Right.\"\n\nI couldn't help but crack up. Even with the creepy static still stuck in my head. Still replaying through my mind.\n\n\"I'm just telling y'all what to expect,\" Ms. Wilder told us. \"You're gonna have to be professional when you get out on the floor.\"\n\nIn a frenetic burst, the locked door knob began rattling. As if the brass knob was pulsating to life. Quick, jarring turns.\n\nStartled, the whole class looked at it.\n\n\"We're training!\" Ms. Wilder shouted at the top of her lungs. Now she was in *serious* drill sergeant mode.\n\nThe rattling grew slower. Weaker.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but we're training!\" Ms. Wilder yelled.\n\nAnd the knob then faded to stillness. A slow death.\n\nEach of us stared at it. Besides a few forced laughs or smiles, we couldn't mask our unease.\n\nMs. Wilder's chuckles shattered the silence as she faced us. \"Well, now that's over with, it's your turn, Abby.\"\n\nThey wired Abby in. And then another call arrived.\n\nAlways the prized teacher's pet, Abby answered before the end of the first ring. Before Ms. Wilder could even jump in.\n\nAnd there was the same static. The same waves of scorched sound. A scrambled symphony.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Abby said into the mic.\n\nThe static persisted. Only now I could hear clear movement. We all could...\n\nLoud footsteps played over the white noise. Staggering footsteps. Falling furniture.\n\nConfused, Ms. Wilder leaned in closer toward the screen.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" Abby repeated.\n\nMs. Wilder faced Kelly. \"That's the same number...\"\n\nKelly checked the screen. The fear made her eyes go wide. \"Oh my God, you're right!\"\n\n\"The one I did?\" Patrick asked.\n\nBehind a worried gaze, Ms. Wilder stared at the laptop. At the listed number. \"Yes,\" she said, her voice hindered by unease.\n\n\"That's the same one?\" Tania exclaimed.\n\nThe static's scratching grew unrelenting. Like a scratched record from Hell, the sounds overwhelmed our minds.\n\nTrapped in an awkward silence, Abby turned to Ms. Wilder for help. About the only thing she could do...\n\nA painful scream shot through the static! The voice a tortured singer on this messy electronica. The female scream was low but agonizing... And it soon gave way to desperate breaths.\n\nNone of my classmates said a word. There wasn't even a lame attempt at humor amidst this shared terror.\n\nThe woman's voice tried to break through the constant static. \"Help... me...\" she strained to say through the gasping breaths.\n\nMs. Wilder faced Abby. \"Talk to her,\" she said, unable to hide her trembling tone.\n\nIn the call, the woman's heavy footsteps were heard stumbling around. Her constant groans as painful as her scream...\n\nLike a deer in the headlights, Abby stared at the screen but couldn't utter a word. Paleness permeated her face. \n\n\"Help... me...\" the woman said.\n\nThe call ended before she could even finish. As if the woman's life support had been unplugged in one merciless pull.\n\nMs. Wilder didn't wait to break the silence. But her terrible acting couldn't hide how much these last few calls had even unsettled her. \n\n\"Okay, that was good, Abby,\" she said. Shuttling us through this lingering fear like cattle, she herded in the next trainee. \"Catherine, it's your turn.\"\n\nBattling both the goosebumps and the cold, I folded my arms. I decided to speak just to get my mind off those disturbing replays. To get the static out of my head. \"Ms. Wilder, what do we do in situations like that?\" I asked. \"Like when it's the same caller bugging us.\"\n\nMs. Wilder gave me a dismissive wave. \"Oh, it's just prank callers. We get a bunch of them.\"\n\nCatherine sat at the laptop.\n\nImmediately, another call came roaring in. After checking the number, Ms. Wilder flashed an excited smile. \"Alright, this one's different!\" she said.\n\nKelly let out a sigh of relief. \"Whoo, thank God.\"\n\n\"You and me both, girl,\" Tania said.\n\nCatherine took the call.\n\nBut the static dashed our safety. The same static. All the intense white noise lent us even more chills in this cold classroom.\n\nWorried, Catherine looked to our instructors. \"Ms. Wilder-\"\n\nMs. Wilder motioned toward the laptop. \"Just talk to them!\"\n\nA long, eerie cry erupted from the laptop. Too human to be a dying animal... too familiar as well. The woman had returned.\n\n\"Oh shit!\" Tania yelled.\n\nLike a terrified wax figure, Catherine stared at the computer, her eyes wide the fuck open. Her mouth too paralyzed to even scream.\n\nThe constant static and scrambling soundscape drifted around our atmosphere. Throughout the classroom.\n\nMs. Wilder took a nervous step back.\n\nAnd then the woman's voice came on the phone. \"Help... me...\" she said in a dying gasp. \"Help... me... please.\"\n\nThe static spiraled out of control. An avalanche of sound.\n\n\"Catherine, talk to her!\" Ms. Wilder shouted.\n\nShivering, Tania stood up. \"How's she calling from a different number!\" her scared voice shouted.\n\nBut we never got an answer. And Catherine never got the opening question out.\n\nA harsh bump erupted from the laptop. A vicious thud and the phone call ended well before the woman's screams could re-emerge. \n\nEach of us were left in horrified suspense.\n\nMy eyes stayed on the computer. My body a trembling mess. I felt helpless. Especially with the looming inevitably of who was going up there next...\n\nRattled, Tania pointed at the computer. \"Ms. Wilder, who's that woman!\"\n\nLike a victim in denial, Ms. Wilder avoided eye contact with us. \"She's just a prank caller, guys. I'm telling you.\"\n\nKelly gave her a weird look. Not even she was buying this shit...\n\nMs. Wilder helped Catherine stand up. \"Y'all better get used to them,\" Ms. Wilder muttered. \"That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nThe heater had no chance at healing my scars. Especially when adrenaline now joined the fear and cold. I kept staring at the laptop. Forced to face my fate.\n\nStuck in a catatonic state, Catherine stumbled back to her seat. The five of us now made a frightened formation.\n\n\"Your turn, Chrysta!\" Ms. Wilder yelled out.\n\nI sat there, hesitant. Unable to console myself before the call.\n\nMs. Wilder waved me over. \"Come on, it's your turn,\" she said. \"Ain't nobody gonna hurt you.\"\n\nWith the slow march of a child heading for the principal's office, I walked up to that front desk. I could feel everyone's eyes glued to my every step.\n\n\"You got this, girl,\" I heard Tania say.\n\n\"Hey, maybe they'll hang up,\" Patrick said as a reassuring joke.\n\nAt least they were trying to encourage me on this creepy Friday morning. But I couldn't smile. Not now. Not on my 911 Judgment Day.\n\nKelly and Ms. Wilder crowded around me as I sat in front of the laptop. I plugged in the headset. My shivering grip placed it over my ears. Now I really felt chained to the computer. To this forthcoming call.\n\nUpon facing the laptop, I felt more anxiety sink into me. So many programs were already up there. A dispatcher box, the phone line, various call taker tabs... all of which I'd seen in the books. But all of it so much scarier on screen.\n\nMs. Wilder pointed me to the phone line icon. \"Now when that rings, just click on it to answer it,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I replied.\n\nTrying to focus, I avoided my classmates. Even when they were just being supportive. Tania and Patrick my constant cheerleaders.\n\nThrough the burgeoning excitement, I had to wait. My skin sweating in the cold, I readjusted the headset's mic. But I didn't have to wait long.\n\nRING, RING, the laptop screamed. The telephone line icon shook with ferocity. The incoming call from 706-645-4545.\n\nI fought against the nerves. I had to power through for me. For Julian. In one swift click, I answered it.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" I said in a strong voice. Channeling my inner Ms. Wilder.\n\nLike a malfunctioning robocall, I heard the white noise grip me. The incessant static sang out.\n\nBut I didn't give up. Not with Ms. Wilder breathing down my neck. And with Julian depending on me back at home.\n\n\"Columbus 911, what's the address of your emergency?\" I said again.\n\nThe static stayed steady. The unsettling noises the sound waves of the dead. Seemingly a distress signal from outer space... or beyond the grave.\n\n\"This can't be happening again,\" I heard Kelly say to Ms. Wilder.\n\n\"Hold on!\" Ms. Wilder told her.\n\nI kept my eyes on screen. Further drawn in once I heard the movements amongst the static. Clumsy movements.\n\n\"Help... me...\" the woman's voice crawled to me.\n\nEveryone went silent. The fear almost overpowered my own voice and strength. *Almost*.\n\n\"Ma'am, what's the address of your emergency?\" I asked. I could feel my hands clenching tight. A nervous tic well beyond my control...\n\nThe footsteps grew heavier in the static storm. As if the woman was mustering whatever strength she had left just for this one call.\n\n\"Help... me...\" she said.\n\nImmersed, I leaned in closer toward the laptop. \"Ma'am-\"\n\n\"Help me!\" the woman cried out in a painful howl.\n\nStartled, I fell back. I heard Tania shout in fright.\n\n\"Help us!\" the woman screamed into the stifling static. \"Help us, please!\"\n\nLike fellow asylum patients, a collection of tormented cries joined her. Female, male. Agonizing screams, weakened whispers. Pitiful sobbing. All of it poured through the line. All these people in obvious pain... all of them dying.\n\nI heard shelves collapse around the screams. More chaotic movement erupted. Their terrified panic well on display.\n\n\"Help us!\" an old lady yelled.\n\n\"Send somebody!\" a panicking man hurled at me.\n\nTheir voices all grew louder and louder. With the static an unsettling beat, their desperate chants formed a desperate final plea. My headset shook from their sheer force.\n\n\"Please help us...\" a young woman whimpered.\n\nThe victims's voices overlapped. Fused together for this frightening frenzy. Their room of death clamored for me. And I was too scared to say a fucking word... much less follow protocol.\n\n\"Please help ussss!\" the woman from earlier screamed, her voice now guttural and pouring from a wounded soul.\n\nFrightened, I pushed myself away from the keyboard. My headset tumbled off.\n\nMy hectic hands hit the touchpad, ending the call. I'd inadvertently sent us into a suffocating silence.\n\nBreathing heavy, I stood still and faced the screen.\n\nA red glow now decorated the phone line icon. The box's text read: *Call Ended 1:44*\n\nOne minute and forty-four seconds of pure terror.\n\nI noticed my scared classmates watching me. Our 911 training course now transformed into a horror house.\n\n\"What'd you do that for!\" Ms. Wilder shouted in dismay. Her voice a beaming defibrillator through our dead silence.\n\nStartled, I confronted her disapproving glare.\n\n\"I told you to never hang up!\" Ms. Wilder yelled.\n\nA calm Kelly stepped toward me. \"Yeah, you should've followed protocol, Chrysta.\"\n\n\"What is you talking about!\" Tania shouted.\n\nI looked over at Tania. Glad to have her on my side.\n\nBack in disciplinarian mode, Ms. Wilder confronted the class. \"Look, this is training! I've told y'all you're gonna get calls like this!\"\n\n\"So?\" Tania replied.\n\nMs. Wilder glowered at me. \"And you're not supposed to hang up, Chrysta! Ever!\"\n\nFor some reason, I looked back at Kelly. Knowing good and well whose side this bitch was on...\n\n\"She's right,\" Kelly said, a stoic calmness returning to her voice. For that matter, both her and Ms. Wilder were *way* too calm...\n\n\"Wait, so this was all bullshit?\" Tania asked.\n\nThe epiphany spread amongst us. I was caught somewhere between relieved and mad as Hell.\n\n\"Holy shit...\" Patrick muttered.\n\nMs. Wilder cracked a wicked smile.\n\nAnd if she wasn't my instructor or thirty years my senior, I would've punched the shit out of her right then and there...\n\n\"Hey, we gotta train y'all for the crazies,\" Ms. Wilder went on. \"And everyone passed except you Chrysta.\"\n\nControlling my temper for Julian, all I did was glare. A death glare for Ms. Wilder *and* Kelly.\n\n\"That's so stupid though!\" Tania yelled.\n\n\"Yeah, who was making those calls?\" Abby asked.\n\nKelly stepped toward the trainees. \"We got some of the call takers to do it.\" She motioned toward the door. \"They always help us with this part.\"\n\n\"Wow...\" was all I could say. I may have been able to stop myself from throwing punches, but I couldn't hide my voice's simmering anger.\n\nChuckling, Ms. Wilder patted me on the back. \"Hey, it's alright. We'll re-do it later.\" She walked toward the door.\n\n\"Re-take it?\" I said in disgust.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Ms. Wilder said. She unlocked the door.\n\nPlaying deputy, Kelly looked over at me. \"She's serious now.\"\n\nMs. Wilder swung the door open.\n\nLecturing me like a high school administrator, Kelly pointed at my face. \"Now I think you'll be fine, but next time, don't hang up on that call! Alright.\"\n\nI heard Ms. Wilder stumble back. In loud, panicking steps.\n\nThen Tania let out one dramatic scream.\n\nThe entire class looked toward the open doorway.\n\nAn ocean of blood flooded all the way down the hall. Right up outside our classroom door. \n\nI could see the vivid redness stick to the floor. Like gruesome paint, blood covered the walls. Even smeared over our classroom door.\n\nAnd there lying in the crimson sea was the 911 Center supervisor. Her sloppy clothes now coated in both blood and deep, crude slices. Long stab wounds carved through her black hair. Her weight reduced in a most gory attempt at bariatric surgery.\n\nFrightened but compelled, I rushed up to the supervisor.\n\n\"Oh God!\" I said.\n\nThe supervisor's hand still gripped her cell phone. And her last dialed number taunted me: *911 Training*. She'd been the one calling us all along. During this crazed caller training gone wrong...\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw the doorknob had smeared red fingerprints. This lady had no chance at getting in. Not when the door was locked. And not when we were training under Ms. Wilder's watch.\n\nI felt a wave of classmates whisk past me. Felt Tania snatch my wrist to drag me away. Drag me through this blood red museum sprawling before us...\n\n\"Who the Hell did this!\" Kelly cried through her tears.\n\n\"I don't know!\" Ms. Wilder yelled at her. \"We gotta get Sgt. Fonda!\"\n\nRather than following the others to the elevators, Tania led me through the 911 Center. Patrick even followed us to the call taker room. Their morbid curiosity apparently just as strong as mine.\n\nLike rain puddles, our feet splashed into the overflowing crimson. The rip-roaring rhythm so hypnotic... and disturbing.\n\nUpon entering the room, we came to a terrified stop.\n\nEveryone was dead. Slaughtered. Sliced beyond recognition. Bodies scattered about like mutilated livestock. Severed limbs in every corner. Severed heads still wearing their headsets. This call taker office a fusion between war zone and operating room.\n\nEverything was covered in blood save for the computer screens. And they all showed the last numbers dialed: *911 Training*. Unable to call 911, these employees had instead called the next best thing: us.\n\nAnd on that final, fateful call, I hadn't followed protocol. Instead, I'd hung up on a massacre in progress. And now we had a Code 7120.

It's a genius idea and one I had come up with myself. Paying tax is a tiresome game for me and one which has been a thorn on my side. So I am always trying to dodge paying tax and the tax man is my devil. I am sure that I am a devil to other people, mainly the poor folk as I take so much from them. I don't want to pay tax and I have found a way round it. \n\nI find an extremely old person who has no connection to any of their relatives, due to family troubles. I then go up to them and I make them feel good. Then I set up a trust fund which is owned by them, I then put billions of pounds in there. Then a contract is drawn which says when the old individual dies, I will get the whole trust fund. Here in the UK there are trust funds which are protected from tax. The old individual has no idea what I am doing but when they die, I inherit my billions without paying tax or sometimes really low tax. \n\nI think it's genius and I have been doing it for many years now. I find a lonely old dying person, and I make a trust fund in their name and I then put billions of pounds in it, where also I am the soul hier to it. It's amazing. I have saved myself so much from paying tax and I really love myself for it. I really do think I am amazing at figuring this out all on my own and no body has sussed it out yet. \n\nThen there is 1 old person who made a trust fund in their name, and I put billions of pounds in the trust fund and where I am the soul hier to it. The lovely old woman signed it and everything. The one problem though is that she hasn't died yet. I then asked one of the workers about when she is supposedly to die. I them get told that she has been alive for 400 years and she doesn't seem to die at all. Her immortality is proving to be a problem for me. I need her to die so that I could inherit the billions that I put into the trust fund in her name. \n\nThen I put something in her food to kill her bit she is still alive? Maybe this one is a loss. I've still got other old people dying and me inheriting my billions without having to pay tax. We all make a loss sometimes.

She is a corgi and is about 4 years old. Everyday I take her for a walk and it is always a positive thing for both of us, it exercises her and makes me feel happy. So a win win.\n\nHer ears perked up when I said that and she tilted her head. “Ruff!” That bark was deafening and I could tell that she really wants to go for one.\n\n“Alright Pibbs, we will go.” I grab her leash and head out the door. The walks are usually the same old, smelling around and going potty everywhere. But this time…was different. She  didn’t go pee or poop at all which was odd to me since she had been holding it in all day because I was gone at school and my brother and mom were out working. \n\n“Alright, I guess you don’t have to go potty then.” I say to her. As we are walking I notice something strange happen with Pibbs. She started to whine and growl like someone or should I say something, was watching us. Obviously freaked out by this I start to pick up my pace and start to pull her a little harder to move faster and get the hell out of what was after us.\n\nBut when I pulled, Pibbles stayed. Still growling and still whining like a hurt hyena. “Never seen her do that before.” I said to myself in a shaky tone. \n\nA few seconds later, maybe 30 she stopped growling and whining and started smiling like her normal happy self does when she goes on walks. “What the fuck was that?!” I mutter out. \n\n“NOTHING” it’s a whisper of what sounds like a girl in the bushes right next to me on the sidewalk we are walking on. “Ah hell no.” I yell out in fear and start sprinting away while Pibbles does too. I guess she noticed my fear too. \n\n“ITS OK, IM NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND FOREVER.” The same whispering voice says. “What the fuck.” I say in a panic. “Who are you and what the hell do you want from me.” “Also how the fuck did you catch up to me so fast without me noticing?”\n\n“Hehehe.” This time the whisper turns real loud. “Hahaha.” The laughing was creepy and almost sounded like she was laughing but also crying at the same time. “What the fuck is so funny!?”\n\nThe same laughing over and over again occurred and I couldn’t take it any longer so I just sprinted again to get the hell out of there. Who the hell was that? Was that a ghost? How did they catch up to me so fast? What do they want? All these questions rushed into my head as I started to hyperventilate with fear.\n\nI am 18 and an adult male and still was to the point of almost crying from fear. The female disembodied voice vanished and was gone now, or so I hoped. \n\nMe and Pibbles cut off into this neighbourhood that we always go to for the daily walks we go on and it’s basically a u-turn to get back home. We are walking and nothing else happens.\n\nWell, until…\n\nUntil, I see a cardboard sign laying in the middle of the road. Going up to it in a slow and fearful manner, I pick it up.\n\n“Go on and have fun on your walk. Be my guest, and go hide that lock. But don’t be mad when you are eaten, by a hawk.” The sign read.\n\n“The fuck is this shit.” I said giggling. Probably some corny teenagers messing around and trying to scare an old lady or something.\n\n“Click. Click. Click. Click.” \n\nIt was low but still audible to hear. It was coming from underneath this bridge. “Pibbles it’s ok.” \n\nWe walk over there to the noise and it stops. Another sign is seen lying on the ground. \n\n“I told you that you should hide the lock.” The sign reads. “What is this twisted bullshit.” I say in anger and annoyance. I was thinking about heading back home but I was to close to solving this weird mystery that I couldn’t leave, not matter how hard I wanted to and knew I had to.\n\nI hear the same clicking noise again. “Click. Click. Click.” “Whoever is here, fucking show yourself.” \n \nThis is when Pibbles started to growl and whine like crazy, like she was on the verge of death.\n\n“LOOK UP BY THE BRIDGE.” The same whispering girls voice from early says. This time right into my ear.\n\nI try to hold back the urge not to look, but I just had to. I look up and what I saw was, was…horrifying.\n\n2 dogs, an old lady, a man, and a little girl. All of them, hanging and dangling down from the bridge. It wasn’t a noose though that they were being hanged by, it was a leash, a fucking dog leash.\n\n“Come on Pibbles. Let’s get the hell out of here! NOW!!” I scream with a fearful tone but also a crying and cracking voice. \n\nI ran all the way back home with Pibbles without stopping the whole way. No more whispering voices were heard the way back and no more twisted signs were lying in the middle of the road. \n\nWhen I got home though, I noticed something peaking out from underneath the doormat at the entrance of my house. A pink slip that was no bigger than a post it note.\n\n“I told you about the lock, now you will be eaten by the hawk.” Is what was written on the slip and this time, all in blood.\n\nI went inside and slammed the door shut locking all the doors and shutting all my blinds. Pibbles stopped with the growling and whining and sat on my bed in my room. My mom rushed in my room in a panic and said, “that was way too long and you worried me to death.” “What happened.”\n\nI told everything that happened and everything I saw and she said to immediately call the police. I did that and told the operator everything as well. \n\nThe next morning the cops knocked at my door and said that no one was caught but the bodies hanged under the bridge have been taken and were confirmed to be that of a family. A grandma, her son, the son’s daughter, and their two pet dogs. \n\nThe mom died a while back from hanging herself by sui**de. So the grandma moved in with her son as well as the granddaughter, and they brought their two dogs as comfort from her tragic death.\n\nI have the theory that what happened was some sort of twisted and evil ritual. But I have no idea.\n\nI mean who was that lady? Whose voice was whispering? What does the hawk have to do with anything? Why torment people who are going on walks and enjoying their day? All these questions that have no answers. \n\nSo to this day, I will never take any dog, I mean any dog, for a walk again.

I was raised Christian by my mother, but was corrupted by my lacrosse teammates in High School.  By the time I was 18, I was no longer going to Church, listening to worldly music and was partying hard,drinking, smoking, and fornicating with girls on the weekends for fun. By the time I was in my early 20's I was pretty Satanic and was deep into forms of new age beliefs and occult practices. During this period of my life, I experienced and witnessed some pretty powerful supernatural manifestations and spiritual experiences.\n\nIn 2015, I was betrayed by my best friend Josh, and his entire family.  In 2015 I had moved in with Joshuah's family , and within two months the living situation became untenable and deteriorated into a satanic and demonic circus, with crazy demonic manifestations and activity. At one point, I was drugged and taken to some satanic orgy, where I was raped by two Satanic witches. I remember vividly that this was the night that Connor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo in the first few seconds of the bout. I remember the fight being on the television in the living room.  I was given a cocktail that made me dissociate and I experienced stoppage of time with repeated white flashes like the  \"neuralyzer\" from the movie Men In Black.  \n\nI believe my ex best friends father was a very high ranking Freemason. Whats funny is that the man looked and talked like Christopher Walken, he enjoyed fine wine, and loved to cook. He was actually pretty hilarious at times, but you did not want to piss the man off.

I showered and made myself breakfast, and pretended I was married. I then got into my car and it was still 4 am at this point. I drove my car and I hit someone who was walking on the road, but I didn't panic at all. \n\nI simply got out of my car and his the body in a bunch of bushes and trees, where the rats and insects will consume it for their lunch.

Then I realised that because I am marrying myself, running away will be running away from myself. So when ever I runaway, it's like I turn into a ghost and wherever I go my body is there right next to me. So running away is out of the option. Nobody should force anybody to marry one's self and especially if they are a bad person. I am a horrid person and I have seriously fucked up things, so getting married to myself is a danger to myself. \n\nMy parent said that I had a year to change and because I saw no way out, I decided to change myself. I changed my whole life around and I made amendments to all those that I had hurt. All of the people I had accidentally murdered due to my reckless actions had visited me as a ghost. They forgave me and it was a heart warming moment. I changes so much that people didn't recognise me and the person that I had turned into was a person I would marry. I had accepted that I was being forced to marry myself. \n\nThen when I thought the day was coming that i was going to get forced to marry myself, my parents told me that they aren't going to force me to marry myself. They just wanted me to change.

Oil is an important element in worldly civilisation today and it is how everything is able to function. From cars to electricity pil plays a vital role. There are countless conspiracy theories that most of the wars in 20th and 21st century was all for oil. Our lives are dependent on oil and every pleasure that we get from our privileges, is from oil. We are not so advanced after all as we are still using something that was made from dinosaurs dying billions of years ago. The main news is that oil is running out. \n\nScience is trying its best to fund an alternative to oil. It is proving a difficult task though and how we all need it, it truly dumbs us down. A couple of weeks ago I was on the train and the doors were about to close. I saw a man running towards the train and this is a common sight. Only half the man's body makes it and the other other was stuck outside. So half the man's body was cut in half by the train doors. Instead of seeing blood, we saw oil instead. \n\nHalf of the man's body was hopping inside the train and he was confused as to why he had oil for blood. Looking outside his other half of the body was also confused as to why he had oil for blood. Some people on the train were secretly collecting some of the oil spilled on the floor in bottles. They wanted to sell it. Then as the train made it to the train stop, some guys in suits too the half hopping man away. Oil was being spilled on the floor still. \n\nAs more days went by I saw more people trying to make it onto the train just before it closes, unfortunately only half of their bodies made it onto the train. The other half was stuck outside. They all had oil fot blood and someone in a smart suit took them away. We started hearing of people sneezing out oil from their noses and bleeding out oil when they cut their fingers. They were never seen again. News started going round of the American government of turning people's bloods into oil by putting something into the air. They were doing this so that they could be free from relying on the middle east for oil. \n\nThen I was nearly late for the train and as the cut me in half, luckily I still had proper red blood. It was a pain to find the other half of my body though. "},"348":{"title":"What kind of driving instructor is this?

I quickly booked a new driving instructor and I didn't expect much from my instructor apart from being the same sort of driving instructor. Very boring and straightforward and easily annoyed. \n\nWhen my driving instructor came up to my house I was shocked to see that the car was really kitted out and the driving instructor was not like I had seen before in the past. He was the gangsta type you know and he even spoke like one. When I drove his car it really revved hard and he made me drive past some really rough areas. He them told me to stop the car and he went up to a guy and started chatting to them. I couldn't hear what they were saying and then suddenly my driving instructor shot him in the face. \n\nHe got into the car and told me to drive fast and I did. I drove fast and I had a few cars that had started to follow me driving. They started shooting at my car but luckily the car was bullet proof and my driving instructor was really shouting at me at which directions I had to take. Luckily we lost those guys and mu instructor then told me to park next to a bank. He went into a bank and then he came out running with loads of cash in his hands as he had robbed a bank. \n\nHe got into the car and told me to drive, and that's when I realised that i was his getaway driver. I couldn't believe it and I drove so fast and we even lost the police. I drive up to my house and it was one hell of a driving lesson. He asks me if I want to book anymore driving lessons with him but I told him that I would like to think about it. I don't want anymore driving lessons anymore in general, and I couldn't believe at the things he has done. To make matters worse some dodgy looking people have been following me. I guess I maybe needing his driving lessons after all.

It hurt but it was worth it but then the skin started to heal so quickly and the name was back to its original position. \n\nNo other parts of my skin healed and i tried going for a mental health walk, but all I could walk past were other people who have also turned into a grave stone.

My body will soon be starting to turn to stone and then my body shape will also be changing. I will start to look more like a gravestone.

Some of his relatives were in his house and they looked at me in pure judgement.

I found my way back home and I was a mess.

Some grave stones have managed to turn back into human, but the deceased came back to life to hunt them down and all inheritances went back to the deceased, while their living relatives became poor. Then I started finding myself in the cold place where Edgar's body is being kept. \n\nMy body is turning to stone and on my body, there are more words which read \"Edgar hickory, 1990-2024, father, husband, building site owner and great friend of the community' and I am to be his gravestone.

But first some back ground. I am infamous around New York for being the best in the biz. I’m no stranger to weird contracts, hell I’ve been hired to kill the governors pet. So when I got a message at 1am offering me two hundred thousand dollars I took the deal. I traveled to buffalo on a plane and bought my guns there, noting since I was so good I never racked up a criminal record so I got it without problem. I was hired to wipe out a building with 17 people, approximately. Something that caught me off guard was that I had to use a pistol with a headless snake etched In it and bullets laced with cobra venom. But two hundred racks in the bank, makes you over look those details.  I had to take an hour to oblige these details so I was onto the building. It was seemingly in the middle of no where in a dead forest. So I proceeded kicked down the door and to kill two of them shooting the first one in the lungs, choked on his own blood and the second one I shot through his left eye and left a crater in the back of his head. I proceeded and killed five more by shooting them from cover when they were charging me, with stained white blades. This caught me off guard but I just shot them down and let the poisons Do it’s work. After this I found the rest in one room. They did not move they just smiled. I naturally got confused and creeped the hell out so I just finished the job. This was in less than one minute, the whole job so I called the number of this guy who hired me to ask when I would get my money wired to me. What happened next made me jump. One of there phones rang. It was the leader he was alive. I let him hang up and that he typed some bit and than I got a notification. Two hundred thousand dollars was wired to my account. The leader was up by a wall slumped over and gave me the same smile and uttered with all his energy “for the lord and the headless snake.” I was naturally curious after this so I looked around. No cops were coming this place was far from the closest town so I saw it as safe to do so. I looked around and found multiple headless snakes in rooms with headless snake paintings all over them. I looked at all there corpses and found a small tattoo on there back neck of the same headless snake. I realized with this I had been hired by no ordinary cult, if there is even such a thing. This was a suicide cult. I wanted to get out of there but I was still curious as to why they had me do this. So I stole some of there scriptures and snake bibles. I’m not saying what it said in those books, but let’s just say I’m leaving the biz and going as far away from that building as possible. And if you ever see that insignia, run. It will drive you insane like me. Those books gave clarity, the most dangerous weapon ever. Don’t look for me cuz you won’t find me. You will find a dead man."},"381":{"title":"Pokeballs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/ikhx6i\/pokeballs\/","flair":null,"author":"warewolf56","selftext":"I was in the park playing pokeman in the park with my 9 year old son Adam.\n\nIt was the last weekend of summer.

Ghost stories, urban legends, all that—it was entertainment, nothing more. But after what happened last winter, I’ve stopped laughing at things I can’t explain.\n\nIt started when I rented a cabin in northern Michigan for some time alone. I needed a break from work, from people, from everything. The cabin was small, tucked into the woods, with no neighbors for miles. Perfect. Or so I thought.\n\nThe first few days were peaceful. Snow fell lightly, muffling the world outside. I spent my time reading, hiking, and enjoying the quiet. But by the third night, I began to notice…strange things.\n\nIt started with the window. I was reading in the living room when I glanced up and saw condensation—a handprint. A single, small handprint on the glass.\n\nIt didn’t make sense. I hadn’t touched that window, and I’d been inside all day. The snow outside was untouched, no footprints leading to the cabin. I told myself it had been there when I arrived and I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nThe next night, I heard the tapping.\n\nIt was faint at first, like the ticking of a clock, but irregular. I was lying in bed, and it seemed to come from the wall behind me. I turned over, holding my breath, straining to hear. The tapping stopped.\n\nI told myself it was the old wood settling in the cold. But deep down, I didn’t believe it.\n\nOn the fifth day, I went for a hike, hoping fresh air would calm my nerves. The trail behind the cabin was beautiful, winding through dense pine trees. About an hour in, I found something strange: a small clearing with a single wooden chair. It was old, weathered, and faced directly toward the path I’d come from, like someone had been sitting there, waiting.\n\nI felt uneasy but pressed on, thinking it was some hunter’s spot. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nThat night, the tapping returned. This time, it was louder, more deliberate. It moved from one wall to another, as though something—or someone—was circling the cabin.\n\nI turned on all the lights and checked every door and window. Everything was locked, the snow outside untouched. But when I returned to the bedroom, I froze.\n\nOn the window above my bed, there was another handprint. This one was larger, and the fingers were impossibly long, stretched almost halfway down the glass.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night.\n\nThe final night is what still haunts me. I was packing to leave early, desperate to get out. Around 3 a.m., the power went out. The cabin was plunged into darkness, the only light coming from the moon reflecting off the snow.\n\nThen I heard it. Not tapping this time—scratching.\n\nIt started at the front door, a slow, deliberate scrape, like nails dragging across wood. I froze, clutching a flashlight, listening as the sound moved to the window, then the wall.\n\nAnd then came the voice.\n\nIt wasn’t loud, more like a whisper carried on the wind, but it was clear. “Let me in.”\n\nI didn’t respond. I didn’t move.\n\nThe voice came again, this time closer. “Let me in. I’m cold.”\n\nI don’t remember falling asleep. The next thing I knew, it was morning. The power was back, and the snowstorm had stopped. I grabbed my bags, threw them in the car, and drove away without looking back.\n\nWhen I got home, I tried to rationalize everything. But a week later, I found something in my bag: a single, weathered piece of wood. It looked like it had broken off a chair.\n\nI don’t hike anymore."},"388":{"title":"Who wins this fight if all 5 of these characters fight ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/1gt26ok","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":""},"389":{"title":"I think I bummed a demon ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1gb1sqe\/i_think_i_bummed_a_demon\/","flair":null,"author":"Queasy_Waltz_1785","selftext":"For context 4.2 days ago I saw a bbb (big booty baddie) 4 meters for my location I activated rizzler mode and bagged her name was clarie and we did some bedtime sparing and she got pregnant and gave Birth to my son she strangely wanted to name him hargomoth I said ok idgaf and then 3 days later he was already fully grown and got a gf and got her pregnant she wanted to name there newborn daughter Sophie and he wanted to name her magonaroth she agreed after he threatened to destroy the multiverse and then 6 hours later she was fully grown then went missing we found her summoning Satan but I stopped her with my massive muscular body then 4 hours ago I got a message form clarie saying: (I shall be back to this realm in one thousand years but since you gave me such pleasure I will give you a servant that looks just Like me and will do what ever you want) I may have doomed the universe but I got a girlfriend "},"390":{"title":"I have to pay child support to my dead child ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1g1t8d5\/i_have_to_pay_child_support_to_my_dead_child\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I have to keep paying child support even though my child is dead. It's an unusual situation I am in and I don't know how to feel about it. I loved my child, but at the same time paying for the child support and alimony was tough. It was a heavy burden and when I first heard that my child was dead, I was ashamed to feel some form of relief and I was sad that he was dead, but at the same time there was relief. How my son ended up dead was all because of my ex wife, my ex wife is a unique character.\n\nWe were arguing over money again and she started putting me down for not wanting to give money freely. So she said \"take it easier for you I'll just put our son down, so you can be free of this responsibility\" she said sarcastically and then I heard a gun shot. I went over to her house and found our son dead. I called the police and the body was taken and my wife was instantly arrested. My son was buried and now I am a free man who can do what he wants now. \n\nThen a year later I get a letter stating my child support payments are going to carry on now for my dead son. I was taken aback by this news and it had an address for where my dead son was now living. I went to that address and the house was seriously breaking down and was clearly not habitable. Then my dead son came out and he was rotting and decomposing, then an old lady came out with him. She was doing weird voodoo stuff around him. She was doing magic to make dead son look more alive. \n\nIt was clear that she unburied my dead son and brought him to life, because she knew that I was paying child support towards him. This is a scam and I tried telling the courts this but they didn't care at all. So now I am paying child support to my dead son and I did try to stop paying, but the witch sent my son and he turned demonic with sharp teeths and claws, and yes this did scare me back into paying child support. So I am paying child support to my dead child and there is nothing I can do about it. \n\nIt's funny how life turns out and I guess the old witch is my wife now. \n\n\n"},"391":{"title":"Join me and my other 3 split personalities on this podcast ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1fkjxbj\/join_me_and_my_other_3_split_personalities_on\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"Join me and my 3 split personalities as we host this podcast show.

It described me in horrible ways but I wasn't ashamed, but rather I found it exciting. So I did more stuff to my wife and I then read about it later on reddit.

This wind caused the boat to occasionally rock back and forth. Crashing into the waves caused the freezing water of the Pacific Ocean to splash all on me. Soaking me wet.\n\n“Ugh, isn’t Mother Nature sometimes a bitch.” I exclaimed in annoyance out loud to myself. \n\nA bit of background information to help things be more understandable. I have been fishing for over 10 years now and only do it as a hobby to make some money on the side. \n\nIt’s not a full time job that I do as I work for a business and create my own art work to sell as the main career, but as a little side gig, make a little bit of money; and hey, fishing in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere surrounded by visibly limitless ocean, is a way to face a fear of deep bodies of water that I have, also known as Thalassophobia.\n\nI only do the fishing about twice a week, normally on the weekends because for some reason it is a relaxing experience to be by myself in solitude with nature itself for a couple hours. Only being out about 10-20 miles from shore, I make sure to stay about 3-4 hours out and make sure to come back before sunset. Living close as well to the beach is what inspired me to begin having this hobby of fishing. \n\nA couple times I have hallucinated some things after being in the intense heat one summer day. The waves started turning into beautiful hilly green meadows, and I tried to get off my boat to walk on them, but then I stopped myself after noticing that they were hallucinations.\n\nBut that wasn’t the scariest middle of the ocean story that I have. Yeah, hallucinating about a beautiful, calming, and serene meadow trying to cause you to drown is not the scariest thing I have experienced. The scariest thing…. is what happened yesterday.\n\nIt was the typical fishing day. Waiting around in boredom waiting for the fishing line to start and move and pull you downward by getting heavier. Until, I noticed something in the distance. It was a little green thing. Sailing closer to it, I get close enough to point out what it is. It was a bottle. \n\n“The classic message in a bottle.” I said to myself chuckling. “Must be something cool.” \n\nReaching out from my boat, I grab it and pull it back into my boat. Opening it… pop goes the cork.\n\nBut I noticed something after doing do. \n\nThere was no message in it. Instead there was only a liquid. A red liquid. \n\n“Probably a drunk that forgot to tie up there wine.” I said to myself rolling my eyes. \n\nBut it wasn’t wine. \n\nIT WAS BLOOD. \n\nI knew this because of the smell of it that I did to see if it was genuinely wine or not. And it wasn’t, it was blood. \n\n“That’s odd.” “Again though I am in the middle of the ocean, and it is pretty odd out here in general… so, I shouldn’t get too worked up about this. I should just get one more big catch and call it a day and sail back to the coast to go home.”\n\nI knew my wife missed me. My sweet, beautiful, wife. The girl of my dreams. I love her so much and I sometimes feel bad when I leave her at home to go on these fishing trips. She always is worried when I go because of the risk and danger of the ocean taking my under and drowning me. \n\nGrabbing my net to get one more catch, I throw it in the cold, deep, blue water, and begin to wait for fish to get in. \n\n*Shake, shake. Shake shake* the net went and it was at this moment that I knew it was time for a big catch. \n\nReeling the net up I see lots and lots of fishies.\n\n“JACKPOT!” I yell out in excitement. \n\nBut than…\n\n*Crash* \n\nWaves crashing hard into my boat. Causing me to rock like crazy. \n\n“Let’s get out of here!” I say in fear but also pride after what I had just caught. “This will probably hands down be my biggest catch I have ever gotten!”\n\n*but this isn’t the scariest part that happened.*\n\nNo not the blood in the bottle and not the waves trying to feed me to the wrath of Mother Nature. \n\nIt was when I noticed another boat in the distance. A tiny boat, about the same size as mine. \n\n“That’s odd, usually when I am out here I am the only one. Must be another fisher. I could say hi to them maybe. But I really should get back before this wind and massive waves take me out any more. But it wouldn’t hurt to just say hello and leave. Ok, fine! I will go over there.” I said in my head after have a little battle of thoughts conflicting each other. \n\nThe waves were pushing me over to the other boat anyways and it wasn’t like I was going against such an obstacle, so why not just meet this fellow sailor. It wouldn’t hurt to do, I mean I have already been out here by myself for hours anyways. \n\nSailing over to the boat close enough to reach and get off onto it, I throw my sea anchor out and come to a complete stop with the only movement being the rocking from the waves. \n\nI get off my ship onto the other one like a pirate and calmly knock on the cabin door in a friendly and quiet manner, making sure to be polite and not startle the person who’s inside. \n\n*knock, knock, knock*\n\nno answer \n\nAgain…\n\n*knock, knock, knock*\n\nNo Answer \n\n“Hello, I don’t mean to interrupt you, just wanted to say hi and wanted to know if you were another fisherman or not or maybe you could be lost, well if you are, than I will help you and am here to help you.”\n\nThen the door opened after the next knock I did on it. \n\nCreaking slowly and creepily like something out of a horror movie. I take a peak inside and see it is absolutely empty. Nobody, no noise, the only thing being a bed, a kitchen, stove, bathroom, etc. \n\nBut I did notice one thing… a terrible stench. It smelled awful. I couldn’t pin point what it was or where it was coming from. But it was terrible. \n\n“Where is this person? Is this another hallucination I am having?” I said out loud, this time in genuine fear.\n\nThat’s when I heard…\n\n*buzz, buzz, buzz*\n\nAround my ears , going around them. \n\nThey were….\n\nFlies????\n\nI watched one in the air to see where it will land at and it went over to the bed. Walking over to the bed, I noticed a swarm of flies above it. Intrigued I pulled the mattress off the bed and found something awful. \n\nA dead corpse lying on the floor. A hole of blood coming out of a man’s head, looking only in his 30s. A pistol lying right by his hand. \n\nBut next to him…. \n\nOh next to him……\n\nWas pure nightmare fuel.\n\nMY OWN WIFES HEAD SEVERED AND LYING ON A PLATE WITH A KNIFE STABBED IN HER Right eye!

Damn I thought i was good robbing stuff by now. I guess we all have our off days and I am running. I guess this counts as my exercise right? Any how as I am running  away, the two police officers chasing me start reporting me to other police officers through their walkie talkies. They start to describe my appearance and I was really shocked. They said that I looked to be in my 20s, tall and of strong muscular build. \n\nI couldn't believe it and i turned around and stopped running. They arrested me but I didn't get sent to jail, I had to do voluntary work and clean up areas. I looked in the mirror and I saw myself as the opposite of what the two police officers had described me. When my voluntary work was done, I couldn't trust mirrors anymore. What if what I was seeing in the mirrors was completely wrong. I needed honesty and police officers were the most honest and especially when they are confronted by crime. I wanted an honest answer. \n\nIn the mirror I saw an ugly decrepit individual who is basically a loser. So I robbed someone in front of some police officers. I started running again, and the police officer chasing me started talking on his walkie talkie to other police officers. He started describing me as a tall strong looking individual. I couldn't believe it. In reflective shop windows I saw myself as this scrawny ugly looking guy, but the police officer describing me was saying the opposite. I didn't know who to trust and I managed to get away from the police officer. \n\nIt could be maybe the mirrors were lying to me and purposely making me to look ugly. I started committing more crimes out in the open in front of police officers. The things they described about me, it was amazing. Most of the time I got caught because I just had to thank the police officers for how they described me. Then someone told me that the police officers were just lying about my appearance as a way to get me to stop running. It made sense but I couldn't buy it. Why would police officers lie? Then I decided to ruin my appearance through use of acid. \n\nThen when I shot someone in the face in front of officers, the way they described my appearance. They described me as a burn like appearance individual. They were telling the truth. Police officers are better than mirrors. Then when the guy I had killed  whose body became possessed by something, started biting people the police started chasing him. \n\nThey described him as a demonic looking fella. Police officers are truly better than mirrors.

Ding dong.” Three disturbing rings. Unsettling pauses in-between each one, about 5 seconds each. This was the first time all of this creepy shit happened and at the time, was what I had prayed would be the one and only time. But, of course… of course… I was WRONG!\n\nLiving alone by myself at the age of 18 has always been creepy yet very nice at the same time. The pleasure of not having to worry so much in life and having the freedom to do whatever you really want at home has always been an ultimate bliss to me. On the other hand, it can get a bit freaky at night time, especially at night time. But me being a man, I had grown past that little fear, until the knocking began. \n\nThe weird thing however, was that I live in the middle of nowhere. Legitimately the middle of nowhere. The epitome of being in literally nowhere. So for someone to be ringing my doorbell at the middle of the night, is very rare and has never happened before, so it gave me the chills when it first happened.\n\nObviously my first instinct was to look out the window that is on the top of the door to see who it is and I did that. But… no one was there. Weirded out, I just dismissed it as a punk teenager or group of teenagers doing the good old classic ding-dong ditch prank. I also did this when I was younger so I understood the joke and left it as it was. I wasn’t in any danger or anything, just some kids pulling harmless jokes to try and scare someone for their YouTube channel to get views on. And that was it for the rest of the night and I went to bed without hearing any more. \n\nBut when this happened, I was very weirded out and had a strange feeling in my stomach. Knowing it was probably just the ding-dong ditch stunt, I still had this unexplained sensation in my stomach. A feeling in which I felt fear but also anger, a feeling like I was gonna throw up. Like one million maggots had been eating away at my guts type of sensation. What if it wasn’t just a joke, what if it was something else, something unknown,  something completely SINISTER!!!\n\nThe next morning it was the same old getting up, eating breakfast, and scrolling on my phone texting with my old friends. Completely forgetting about what happened the night before until it just hit me all of a sudden in my memory. I was thinking about it all day even after breakfast that morning. When I would take a shower, when I cleaned the house, when I was driving around town, even when I was on the toilet. It was just lingering in my mind somehow even though I knew it was nothing to worry about. I can’t even tell you how many times I tried to get rid of the thought of it, but every time I did, it enhanced and worsened somehow.\n\n“What the hell Jaron, it was just some silly kids pranking you last night. Nothing more than that. You are a grown man being scared of some punks.” I said to myself in my head. “Get over it and just go and take a walk for a little bit to clear your mind.” \n\nListening to myself I follow my own commands and take a quick walk around where I live, complete solitude, peace, and nature as well as the feeling of someone watching me or better… SOMETHING… watching me.\n\nWhen this weird sensation and feeling that we all have kicked in, I told myself, “nah, fuck that shit, hell no” and I started to speed walk back to my house. When I was doing this however, the thought of the night before was very vivid and kicked in my head randomly. The noise of the doorbell going “ding dong” and the feeling of that feeling in my stomach in which maggots were eating away at my insides, grew back and came back to my harmless, innocent, soul.\n\nQuickly rushing into the door of my house, I slam it shut, and deadlock the fuck out of that shit. This was a rare moment in which I have been very scared to the point in locking everything in my house up. The last time I did this was when I was sure I was being followed by this crazy homeless man that came out from the trees nearby. But it turned out that the poor man just wanted money and was just trying to get money from me. Feeling bad about this interaction but also listening to my guts, I went back out and gave the man 5 bucks. He said, “bless your soul” and smiled as he turned around and walked away. Knowing that he was just asking for money and wasn’t trying to do anything harmful to me was when he walked past my house down the desolate street, looking for someone else to bargain from. \n\nFeeling silly about that whole thing really made me change a lot and that moment was 2 years ago. I moved out from living with my mom, when I was 16 because of some family issues. I sometimes miss that warm home but also at the same time don’t, a feeling that is hard to explain really.\n\nAnyways, the second time I heard the knocking was during the night again after the night the first knocking was heard. I had just gotten ready to go to bed after pulling an all nighter playing video games. It was 2 AM, so very late at night, or technically the morning for all those dorks out there that wanna correct me, (don’t take it seriously or be offended, I’m just kidding and I love you). \n\nGetting my bed set up and turning off my light, I hear a faint pounding noise. “thud… thud… thud… Thud… Thud… THUD!!!” \nThe last one was extremely loud and startled me I gotta admit.\n\n5 knocks, the first 4 starting off quite than progressively turning loud. I noticed that this time instantly though that it wasn’t any ringing from the doorbell, it was just plain old knocking.\n\nI just waited in my bed silently, acting like a coward with the blanket covering my face, hiding underneath it. In genuine fear, I heard my heart pounding and could feel it. \n\n“THUD THUD THUD THUD!!!” This time the knocking but very very loud. Extremely loud.\n\nAgain… “THUD THUD THUD!”\n\nThen: “THUD, THUD!”\n\n “THUD!”\n\n*And than complete silence*\n\n“What the actual fucking shit was that!?” I said to myself screaming in my own head. And then I went to bed without even knowing it, drifting off. \n\nThen I woke up suddenly. Looking at my phones time it showed 2:35 AM. “I had only been asleep for 20+ minutes! Come on, what fucking now?” I said in annoyance and rage. \n\n“Ding dong ding dong! Thud, thud thud! Hehehehehehhahahhaahhah. Buzz buzz buzzzz! Hahhahahahah! Hahahah! IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU JARON! Hahahahahahah!!! YOU LITTLE SHIT!!! Hahahaha! Time to get murdered! Heheheh! Ding dong ding dong ding dong!!! LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nI suddenly woke up again sweating.\n\n*it was only a horrible nightmare!*\n\nGetting out of my bed to get a glass or water to calm myself down from the nightmare, I walk out my room and head downstairs to the kitchen. But than… \n\n“Ding dong ding dong gggggggg ongggg ongggg!” The last note was long and echoey sounding and it looped around in my head for a long time till it faded away into fucking nothingness!\n\n“I AM GOING FUCKING CRAZY AREN’T I?” I whispered to myself. \n\n“Ofc you are, aren’t we all?” A voice muttered down the hall. It was coming behind the door. Gently stepping over to the voice to avoid creaking from the wooden floor panels even though whoever was outside heard me, I make my way over to it after grabbing a knife from the kitchen I was in before.\n\nI creep my head up to the window of the door and I first see nothing.\n\nThan…\n\n*a white thing in the corner of my eye, in my peripherals vision.*\n\nFocusing more on it since it is dark I flip on the outdoor light and notice that it is a piece of a paper and it has… writing on it?!. It is a note?! I open the door and swiftly grab it running into the house faster than the speed of light it felt like, and close the door locking it instantly.\n\n“The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” The note read. “The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” Again same sentence. The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in! The one who knocks at night, shall never be let in!” Over and over again, on every single space on the paper, even on the… EVEN ON THE FUCKING BACK!!!!!!\n\n“What the fuck!” \n\nThan, \n\n“THUMP!!! THUMP!!! THUMP!!!\n\n“THUMP!!! THUMP!!!”\n\n“THUMP!!!”\n\n3, 2, 1! It was in order like it was counting down something.\n\nTaking this as some sort of a message I peek over the door to the window and I see a black figure in the distance. A shadow of a human. It looked like a male, about 6 feet tall.\n\nIt got closer and I made out a face that looked very familiar. \n\nMY OWN FACE! \n\nThey were wearing a mask maybe of my face? How did they get that and make it? Have they been stalking me? Who are they? \n\nAll these questions flowing through my puny little mind that had no answer. \n\n“Leave please or I will call the cops and I have a knife!” I yell out from inside my house. No response just the same knocking again and again.\n\nThis time very very very close to my door, I could make out more of the face and…\n\nIT WAS NO MASK THAT HE WAS WEARING.\n\nIt was me. It was fucking me!\n\n“Thump, thump, thump.”\n\n“Thump, thump.”\n\n“thump.”\n\nThis time the knocks being softer, especially the last one, being barely audible even by being so close to the fucking door! \n\nI took these knocks as another some sort of message and looked at the note again and notice something.\n\nA doodle of an arrow pointing to the top of the page signaling that I need to look up. On the roof read…\n\n“PS: If it reminds you of someone you know but have never known at the same time, especially don’t let them in, since they shall not be let in, the one who knocks at night!” "},"398":{"title":"The house","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1eqvedx\/the_house\/","flair":null,"author":"Zoeyeng","selftext":"Me 15 female now I am 15 and I was probably around 87 at the time of this when I was laying in bed.

A couple of days ago at a restaurant that I was watering, I picked up dog shit and served it to a rude couple. They enjoyed it so much and it's a power of mine. \n\nI work at various restaurant as a waiter, and I remember when some people that I knew from high school came into the restaurant. I didn't like them at all and they were all being pretty rude to me for working at a restaurant. The rudeness was masked though. I decided to serve my own shit to them on a plate, and as soon as I served them a plate of my own shit, they ate it up. It tasted so good to them and even smelled good. To me though I could smell it exactly how it is supposed to be smelled. \n\nAs my past high school peers were kind of making fun of me for working at a restaurant as a career, they were eating my shit.

The trials a child must go through in life and all of the fears, anxiety and trepidation they must face is daunting. As a responsible parent I have been doing my best to show my daughter that ghosts don't exist and I have taken many steps to assure her that ghosts don't exist. I myself use to be scared of ghosts as a child but my father helped me through it and I will do the same with my daughter.\n\nIn our family there is a tradition that we do when one member is scared of ghosts and I called all of the extended family and neighborhood friends to come to my house. The main event was going to be about my daughter realising that ghosts don't exist and it will be nice for everyone to be together as it has been a long time.  My daughter was terrified and even more anxious as she was going to be the main attraction, but I told her that after the event she will no longer be scared of ghosts. \n\nThen when the day arrived and all of the guests gathered around the house with a man tied up to a chair, my daughter was in the middle. The man tied up to the chair was killed and as he died I told my daughter \"observe this man dying body is there any spirit coming out of him?\" And my daughter just stared at him with wide eyes. For hours we all just stared at a dead body as we were all witnessing no kind of spirit coming from the mans body. This was a lesson for my daughter and a reminder to everyone else in the room that ghosts or spirits don't exist. \n\nThen on another night my daughter got scared again and killed our cat.

Anyways when I turned 18 I started getting super closing shifts and what not which basically is like someone who closes out a grocery store ur last one out of the building.\n\nIt’s an average job that anyone could do but anyways a coworker who I worked with told me a story about when she super closed once. She told me she cleared the women’s restroom out and nobody but Mark the other super closer was on the floor and in the building. She had to stop and use the restroom she made sure no one was in there but after doing this she got done with her business and noticed the stall door next to her had a pair of feet. Not shoes but bare feet which is a little weird because nobody in their right mind goes into a public restroom with no shoes, she didn’t say anything but kept her business to herself and then when she was about to leave the stall she now smells a horrible smell like death or something which absolutely doesn’t smell like shit or anything she basically got out of that stall and then when she walked past the stall that had a pair of feet in them she sees through the crack of the door that a woman is staring back at her now she becomes paranoid and tells her that the building is closed and she must leave. The woman says nothing but is still staring at her like she was watching her. Next thing next the coworker is about to leave the restroom right before she hears the stall door open and the woman who was in that stall runs out and dead sprints right at her so the coworker GTFOs outside the restroom and when she gets out of that restroom she inevitably looks back and the woman didn’t follow her out of the restroom and apparently she never saw her again before she was fired because she was late to work 1 too many times. \n\nOk I’m a bit shaken up by her telling me this story but she definitely was one of the weed smokers but weed doesn’t make you hallucinate like that. And she never would do mushrooms on a shift because she was still clocked in. So anyways my mind starts to race but other then that I closed it out and it was an uneventful night but my next shift I was on utility and while taking trash out of the theater I notice out of the corner of my eye a black shadowy mass that was watching me and I stare at it point blank and it was gone. I shooked it off as my eyes playing tricks on me maybe it was just the lights playing tricks on me but I couldn’t explain the figure being at least 2 times my height and I’m an average guy I’m 5’9 and what ever I saw in that theater was definitely two times my height and even as I remembered it more it had a face to with no eyes. I definitely was now concerned about working there. \n\nA few months later me and my manager for that shift were cleaning out a row in a theater it was super busy that day and nobody could prank us because the other Ushers were already about to clean a XD theater me and her are finishing up the same row and next things next I hear this roar that no man could replicate it. It almost sounded animalistic but I heard and me and my manager lock eyes I give it a few seconds because maybe it was a guest playing tricks with us and they were gonna run away but I never heard footsteps and this time I turn to my manager Kendra and I ask? “Did u hear that too” she being a 5’3 20 year old woman turns to me and quivers out a “yeah” I tell her to call over the radio where the ushers are and the other manager says they are cleaning 11. And then we now just book it out of 19. Year passes and nothing like that until I hear a story from one of my fellow weed smokers who told me a few days ago about why I should never be in theater 11 alone like ever.\nShe was cleaning 11 and as she’s about to exit the theater she hears a pair of footsteps running up and down the stairs and then next thing you know she investigates to see if anyone had came into the theater and now she’s all alone she then goes to the top row and no one was hiding and so she shakes it off as her brain playing tricks on her and not even 5 minutes pass and one of the maintenance workers runs into the theater she was cleaning in he asks “did you see the emergency exit door propped open in 11” she now knows that this was now supernatural. \nOn new years day 2023 a family of 4 were going to watch a movie when they had a argument on which movie to watch and the father runs to his car grabs a revolver and shoots himself right in front of his family. Every time I clean that theater I get a overwhelming sense of dread.

Never look directly at the security cameras.\n2. If you hear footsteps behind you after midnight, keep walking. Don’t turn around.\n4. If you see someone who looks just like you, avoid them at all costs.\n\nI laughed it off at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. But the more I worked there, the less funny it became.

Sometimes I could feel their cold, mechanical gaze on the back of my neck.\n\nThe second week, I heard footsteps echoing through the empty warehouse around 1 AM. I remembered the rule and didn’t turn around. The footsteps stopped as soon as I reached the break room, but the sense of being watched didn’t.\n\nThings escalated from there on.

When I persisted, he looked at me with those cold, dead eyes and said, “You can’t leave. You belong here.”\n\nThe last straw was a few nights ago. I was doing inventory when I saw something that looked exactly like me, standing at the end of the aisle. It smiled with my face and started walking towards me. I ran, not stopping until I was outside, gasping for breath.\n\nLast night, I decided to investigate the warehouse further. I waited until everyone disappeared and crept back inside. I found a hidden staircase leading down to a basement I never knew existed. The air grew colder with each step, and the walls seemed to close in around me. At the bottom, a heavy metal door stood there and a faint sound of humming machinery coming from within.\n\nI pushed the door open and stepped inside. The room was filled with monitors, each showing different angles of the warehouse. In the center, a large, cylindrical tank bubbled with a thick, green liquid. Floating inside were distorted, half-formed versions of my coworkers. And at the far end of the room, sitting in front of a console, was Mr. Thompson, his eyes glowing the same cold blue as the cameras.\n\nHe turned to me and smiled, a chilling, predatory grin. “Ah, you’ve found us,” he said, standing up. “I was hoping you’d be curious enough to join us.”\n\nOut of shock I approached him and turned him around. I pulled his pants down and gave him the most devious backshots you could think of. Then I turned him around and let him suck it. \n\nI think he even liked it."},"405":{"title":"The school had banned the students from ever using the toilets ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Horror_stories\/comments\/1crfnx5\/the_school_had_banned_the_students_from_ever\/","flair":null,"author":"shortstory1","selftext":"In school, all toilets have been banned and it was obviously criminal what the school had done. They just banned the toilets for a week and they didn't tell us why but they did give us permission to go outside of school to find an available toilet to use even if a student left in the middle of the class. How news got around about the school not allowing toilets to be used was like wildfire and there was an uproar from the parents. It was so random how the school just banned toilet use. Even though there were signs signalling 'work being carried out' we weren't seeing any workers working on the supposed broken toilets. \n\nAnyhow one day as I was in a boring maths class, suddenly the whole of reality had changed. The school became one big bouncy castle and we were all bouncing around. The teachers shouted \"Who used the toilet to do a number 2!\" And it was then that we found out that whenever somebody took a crap in the toilets, it literally blessed the whole school and it would change the reality of the school. That was when we all found out why the toilets were banned. \n\nThen each student one by one had to do a number 2 in the toilets, in the hopes one student taking a dump in the toilets would bless the whole school to go back to normal. Each student taking a dump in the toilet and blessing the whole school kept changing the reality of the school to something whackier than the last. It was a failed attempt and it looked like the school was all lost. Then one student who is usually the silent one tends to be by himself. He took a crap in the toilets and his blessing of the whole school turned it back to normal. \n\nThe teachers were so grateful and everyone had to go back to their seats and never use the school toilets in any circumstances. They reminded us how we could go outside of school at any time to use toilets in other establishments like restaurants, gyms and anything else similar. \n\nThen the school walls started to eat people when they walked close to the walls. It was then clear that silent students' toilet dump wasn't a blessing but had turned the school into an entity. Everyone tried going outside and nobody tried taking a dump in the toilets to bless the school and change its reality, the school is done for.

He became highly erratic and crazy about going to hell and he wanted me to help him go to hell. I was just so confused about this, and everyone wants to go to heaven usually and not hell. He started calling me a useless father for not knowing how to go to hell. He started off doing bad things to people like robbing things and being violent. He became a liar and started committing a lot of sins. When he summoned a demon and asked whether he could go to hell, the demon told my son that he wasn't evil enough to go to hell. \n\nThen my son went from 0 to a hundred when he started pouring acid on people's faces. He picked out pretty people and poured acid on their faces. He even got into a fight with someone because my son didn't pour acid onto his face, which meant that person wasn't good-looking. My son just slashed his face stole a car and drove off laughing. Still, my son was not evil enough to go to hell and he was furious. \n\nHe even told me off for not doing enough for him and helping him get to hell. He would shout at the floor and demand that hell should take him. He started pouring acid on more pretty people's faces. He upped his antics and he became much worse and his violence became more volatile. He was a fan of people who had died and came back and went to hell for a moment. He would ask them what hell was like and even though they tried to scare him about hell, it only made my son want to go to hell even more.\n\nMy son at this point had ruined so many pretty people's lives by throwing acid on their faces. When my son asked a demon whether he could go to hell, the demon said no. The reason my son was still not accepted into hell after throwing acid at pretty people's faces, was that he has actually freed pretty people from the chains of constantly having to look good by being ugly now. My son had unintentionally freed people from being pretty and now they are leading more enriched lives which isn't shallow or materialistic. My son was furious and he even hurt the demon. \n\nMy son is doing his best to get into hell but hell doesn't want him.

To travel in time is an ability sought out for by everyone. Imagine being able to go back or forwards in time and the amount of power that can generate. It's a dangerous power and it can be used for good or evil. You have got to be careful that you don't change things permanently and that could be devastating. Ryans emotions and opinions can travel in time, his body is fixed in place in present day but his emotions and opinions can go back or forwards in time. \n\nWhen I went to visit Ryan a couple of months ago his opinions and emotions had gone back in time to the 18th century. He was racist towards the black community now and his thinking was now that he didn't like anyone from the black community and that slavery is a necessity. I couldn't believe what I was heart and his opinions feelings had really stretched back in time. Ryan was saying some really racist things towards people of different skin colour. I did not like this at all and I was really hoping that his opinions and emotions would come back to present day. \n\nThen he started saying things about women and how they are below men. This was getting really out of hand. I had to explain to people out in public, that my friends emotions and opinions have gone back in time, because he was mocking peoples different skin colour and saying bad things about women outside in public. I was begging for his emotions and opinions to come back to present day. Then my friend looked at me and he told me that his emotions and opinions were now travelling far past present day, but towards present day. \n\nI was so glad and when his emotions and opinions were now in the future, he was no longer racist or sexist. Then when he saw a baby in a cot, he spoke about the baby and picked it up. The mother was rightly concerned and my friend said good things about the baby by saying how babies are the future. Then he went dark and said \"life is just pointless though because we are all going to die. We will all die and it will be like we were never born in the first place\" \n\nLuckily police was round and grabbed him. His opinions and emotions are still in the future.

It's so frustrating and sat navs are supposed to be a driver's best friend, and there are so many places I want to go. It's such work trying to figure out where places are supposed to be. I wanted to go to a fancy restaurant,  but the stupid sat nav kept taking me to the police station. Like I promised someone I would be there and now that someone will be so disappointed. The police station is opposite the restaurant. \n\nIt is hard to think how people back in the day managed to drive around without sat navs. I mean that's just chaos and having to look at a map, and even asking strangers, come on that's just too much work. Sat navs are a God send and when I put in the postcode to take me to some forest, as I wanted a long walk, my sat nav took me to the police station again. I am like what the fuck and what is it with this sat nav. It's brand new and I am already posted off with it. \n\nOh, I love it when I know a certain place off by heart and I can just drive you know, and knowing that I will never get lost is an amazing feeling. When you know the roads of a certain area, the world is your oyster.

This obsession with the police station started to drive me nuts. Now I get attached to things but I knew that I had to get a new sat nav.

Then the media got attention and doctors examined me while I was peeing. I was fine but I was still peeing and when a year went by, I was still peeing. I was all alone in this house now, peeing till the end of time. People lost interest and now and then I get a plumber to check the toilet is still working. \n\nFunnily enough I haven't felt hunger or thirst during this peeing situation.

Be it accidental littering or having to run across the road to reach something. \n\nAll the while murderers, thieves and other big time criminals got away with anything.

The tribe is once again bigger than them and the Spartan population has gone down.

The leader of the Spartan army got word of an amazing warrior that could even the odds even if the Spartan army is less than 200. They don't even have any slaves to fight alongside them. When they first saw the great warrior, the Spartan leader laughed at him. \n\nThe Spartan leader also wanted to kill the two men who brought the disabled and decrepit man to them, who they said was an amazing warrior. The amazing warrior was disabled and even mentally slow, he would have been thrown over the cliffs if he was born as a Spartan baby.

The two who manage yoyan, they now wanted a fee for the Spartans next battle and the Spartans paid. \n\nThe second battle between the Spartans and the enemy tribe, they all saw dead soldiers who were killed by yoyan in battle.

I love losing my way\" and yoyan did amazing in battle and won the Spartans another battle. \n\nThen the leader of the Spartans wanted the disabled yoyan to kill and stab every Spartan soldier.
