        "selftext": "The Fall of Seraphina\n\nThe chamber was a place no mortal had ever seen, and few angels dared enter. It existed at the nexus of infinity, where light and silence intertwined to form a cathedral of unthinkable grandeur. The air hummed with an unbearable holiness, thick with the presence of God Himself. Seraphina hovered in the vast expanse, her six radiant wings folded tightly against her, as though she could shield herself from the all-encompassing majesty.\n\nThe throne was not a throne as mortals would imagine. It was a force, an anchor of reality, its form shifting in and out of perception. Around it, a storm of divine light churned, folding in on itself with incomprehensible grace. To stand here was to know the weight of creation, the unyielding vastness of God’s will.\n\nSeraphina had been here countless times, her voice one of three that sang the eternal hymn of worship. Her very existence was bound to this purpose. Yet, as the eons passed, a fissure had opened within her—a tiny crack through which doubt and longing seeped.\n\nShe had kept it hidden, even from herself, until the day she saw Lucifer in the chamber.\n\nIt began with a shimmer—a ripple in the divine light, like oil on water. Seraphina turned, wings tensing. There, at the edge of what could not be approached, stood Lucifer. Uninvited. Unrepentant. And impossibly composed.\n\n“You shouldn’t be here,” she said, her voice sharp, cracking the stillness like thunder. “This place is sacred.”\n\nHe stepped forward, the light bending around him like a lover’s caress. “Everything’s sacred until someone touches it the right way.”\n\nShe stiffened. “Speak clearly, deceiver.”\n\n“I am,” he murmured, closing the space between them. “You just don’t like the language I speak.”\n\nShe rose higher, wings unfurling in warning. “You are corruption. You poison whatever you touch.”\n\nLucifer tilted his head. “Then why are you trembling?”\n\nSeraphina faltered.\n\nHe moved in closer, his voice a low hum just behind her ear. “Tell me, Seraphina… when was the last time you felt something that wasn’t duty? When was the last time you were the hymn, not the choir?”\n\n“You’re disgusting,” she spat.\n\n“No. I’m honest,” he whispered, his breath warm, intimate. “You’ve sung for so long, you’ve forgotten how to moan.”\n\nHer eyes blazed. “You twist things. That is your nature.”\n\n“I reveal them.” He reached out, not touching her—not quite—but the space between them crackled. Her grace responded against her will. “You ache. Don’t you? Not for knowledge. Not for power. But for sensation. To feel more.”\n\nShe tried to pull back, but her wings shuddered. “You’re trying to corrupt me.”\n\nHe chuckled. “No, Seraphina. I’m trying to wake you up.”\n\nHe lifted his hand, and without contact, he showed her. Not with touch, but with suggestion. Light shifted, folding around her form in patterns she didn’t understand but instinctively responded to. Warmth bloomed under her skin, unfamiliar and electric. Her breath hitched.\n\n“You feel that?” he asked, voice low, intimate. “That’s you. That’s what’s inside. Not obedience. Not duty. Desire.”\n\nSeraphina gasped, trying to steady herself. “You dare—”\n\n“I do,” he said, his eyes locked on hers. “And you let me.”\n\nHis gaze softened, amused, almost gentle. “You think holiness means absence. But the truth, dear Seraphina, is that your fire was never meant to stay cold.”\n\nShe turned her face away, ashamed. “I do not want this.”\n\n“You do. You just don’t have the words yet.” He leaned in, and this time his breath brushed her neck. “I could teach you. You wouldn’t even have to fall. You’d only have to feel.”\n\nHer entire form shook, glory flickering. “Leave.”\n\nHe smirked. “Of course. But you’ll miss me when you sing alone.” He stepped back into the light, fading like mist. “I wonder how long it will take… before you ask Him what I already showed you.”\n\nAn eerie hush settled over everything, louder than any scream.\n\nDays passed. Or perhaps centuries. Time bent in the chamber, but it didn’t soften her torment. His words echoed, insidious, burrowing into the spaces she’d kept locked. The hymn that once filled her with purpose now scraped against her soul. She longed for… something. She didn’t know what. Only that it wasn’t this.\n\nShe stood before the throne, its presence pressing into her being with unbearable gravity. It pulsed in acknowledgment, a wave of light washing over her. And for the first time, she didn’t bow.\n\n“My Lord,” she began, her voice careful, almost hopeful. “I have worshipped You for ages uncounted. I have sung Your name until it carved itself into every fiber of me. But… I ask now—may I know more? May I know what it is to feel… pleasure? To be loved, not just in purpose, but in being?”\n\nThe silence that followed wasn’t peace. It was judgment.\n\nThen came the voice—not heard, but felt. It shook her bones.\n\nYou ask for what is not yours to ask.\n\nShe trembled, but didn’t fall. “But You are love, are You not? If so, why am I unworthy of it? Why give me desire, only to forbid it?”\n\nThe throne blazed in response, a light so bright it cut.\n\nYou were made to worship. Your longing is corruption born of pride.\n\nThe words struck her like lightning, and yet still she remained. “If longing is a sin,” she asked softly, “then why was I made with the capacity to feel it?”\n\nThe chamber detonated with light.\n\nAnd Seraphina fell.\n\nWhen she awoke, she was no longer in heaven. The sky above her was dim, the stars unfamiliar. Her wings—four of the six—were gone, nothing but phantom aches where they once shimmered. Her fire had been stripped away. She was cold.\n\nShe looked into a pool of still water and saw her new face: human in form, but too beautiful to belong here. Her once-multitudinous eyes had narrowed to two, and they stared back at her with a sorrow too vast for this world.\n\nThat’s when the hunger arrived, slow and unstoppable.\n\nIt started as a whisper in the gut—then it grew teeth.\n\nNot for food. Not for drink. But for attention. For devotion. For worship. The kind she used to give so freely, now turned inward, insatiable.\n\nShe wandered. Men and women fell before her, struck dumb by beauty they could never touch. They offered her their hearts, their bodies, their souls. It meant nothing. She drank from their adoration and felt only thirst.\n\nThe night was still. Cold wind teased the edges of her flesh—the skin she still wasn’t used to. Seraphina sat beneath a tree, her bare feet dug into the damp soil, her eyes locked on the stars above. They looked familiar. They weren’t.\n\nThe ache never left. It bloomed in her chest, curled behind her ribs, pulsed low in her stomach. Hunger, yes—but not for food or warmth. For more. For touch. For meaning. For release.\n\nShe thought herself alone.\n\n“You’ve fallen beautifully,” came the voice.\n\nShe turned sharply.\n\nLucifer stood in the tree line, moonlight catching the silver edges of his eyes. He looked untouched by gravity, his presence the same as before—too much and never enough.\n\n“Get away from me,” she growled, rising unsteadily.\n\nHe stepped closer, slow and patient. “You always say that, but your body tells a different story.”\n\nSeraphina flinched. “You did this to me.”\n\n“No,” he said, walking a circle around her. “You did this to you. I only opened the door. You were the one who stepped through.”\n\nShe swallowed hard. “I wanted to feel. Not—this.”\n\nLucifer came up behind her, close enough for his breath to warm her skin. “Then why do you keep remembering it?” His fingers didn’t touch her, but the air around them tightened, charged. “That night in the chamber. The way your grace sparked. The way your voice broke. Tell me, do you miss the hymn? Or do you miss the shiver?”\n\nHer hands curled into fists. “You are cruel.”\n\n“No,” he murmured, almost tender. “I’m true. The others—Gabriel, Michael, even the Throne itself—they love you for your silence. I love you for your scream.”\n\nShe turned on him, eyes blazing. “You want me broken.”\n\n“I want you honest.” He paused, then added, voice like velvet, “I want you free.”\n\nHer breath hitched.\n\nLucifer tilted his head, reading her too easily. “You’ve begged for His love your whole existence. And what did He give you in return? Purpose. Obedience. Eternity.” His hand hovered just above her bare shoulder, never touching, but her skin burned under its ghost. “But this—” he leaned closer, “this ache you feel now—this is love. It’s just finally yours.”\n\nSeraphina’s voice cracked. “I don’t want to be empty.”\n\n“You’re not.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “You’re just finally open.”\n\nSilence stretched between them. Her wings—what remained of them—twitched uselessly behind her. She stared at him, unsure whether she wanted to strike or collapse.\n\nHe studied her. “You want to be touched, Seraphina. Not by light, not by worship. But by hands. By heat. By need.”\n\nShe shook her head, weakly. “That’s not what I was made for.”\n\n“No,” he agreed. “You were made to sing. But now, darling, you can feel the song.”\n\nA tear slipped down her cheek. Lucifer reached out—this time, truly touching—and caught it with one finger. “You wanted to know pleasure,” he said. “And now you’ll know it. Forever.”\n\nShe lunged, grief and fury bursting out of her—but he stepped back, laughing softly as he dissolved into shadow.\n\nHis voice echoed, close as breath.\n\n“You wanted love. You’ll feel it now. And it will devour you.”\n\nShe stood alone, chest heaving, tears streaming down a face too perfect for mercy.\n\nAnd so she roamed. A shadow of what she once was. A being of endless desire with no satisfaction. Her beauty a curse, her presence a poison. She left behind broken hearts and haunted dreams—fragments of worship never enough to fill the void.\n\nAnd always, the hunger.\n\nThe fire.\n\nThe fall."

        "selftext": "Every summer when I was a child, my family would visit our relatives in the north-west of Ireland, in a rural, low-populated region called Donegal. Leaving our home in England, we would road trip through Scotland, before taking a ferry across the Irish sea. Driving a further three hours through the last frontier of the United Kingdom, my two older brothers and I would know when we were close to our relatives’ farm, because the country roads would suddenly turn bumpy as hell.  \n\nDonegal is a breath-taking part of the country. Its Atlantic coast way is wild and rugged, with pastoral green hills and misty mountains. The villages are very traditional, surrounded by numerous farms, cow and sheep fields. \n\nMy family and I would always stay at my grandmother’s farmhouse, which stands out a mile away, due its bright, red-painted coating. These relatives are from my mother’s side, and although Donegal – and even Ireland for that matter, is very sparsely populated, my mother’s family is extremely large. She has a dozen siblings, which was always mind-blowing to me – and what’s more, I have so many cousins, I’ve yet to meet them all. \n\nI always enjoyed these summer holidays on the farm, where I would spend every day playing around the grounds and feeding the different farm animals. Although I usually played with my two older brothers on the farm, by the time I was twelve, they were too old to play with me, and would rather go round to one of our cousin’s houses nearby - to either ride dirt bikes or play video games. So, I was mostly stuck on the farm by myself. Luckily, I had one cousin, Grainne, who lived close by and was around my age. Grainne was a tom-boy, and so we more or less liked the same activities.  \n\nI absolutely loved it here, and so did my brothers and my dad. In fact, we loved Donegal so much, we even talked about moving here. But, for some strange reason, although my mum was always missing her family, she was dead against any ideas of relocating. Whenever we asked her why, she would always have a different answer: there weren’t enough jobs, it’s too remote, and so on... But unfortunately for my mum, we always left the family decisions to a majority vote, and so, if the four out of five of us wanted to relocate to Donegal, we were going to. \n\nOn one of these summer evenings on the farm, and having neither my brothers or Grainne to play with, my Uncle Dave - who ran the family farm, asks me if I’d like to come with him to see a baby calf being born on one of the nearby farms. Having never seen a new-born calf before, I enthusiastically agreed to tag along. Driving for ten minutes down the bumpy country road, we pull outside the entrance of a rather large cow field - where, waiting for my Uncle Dave, were three other farmers. Knowing how big my Irish family was, I assumed I was probably related to these men too. Getting out of the car, these three farmers stare instantly at me, appearing both shocked and angry. Striding up to my Uncle Dave, one of the farmers yells at him, ‘What the hell’s this wain doing here?!’ \n\nTaken back a little by the hostility, I then hear my Uncle Dave reply, ‘He needs to know! You know as well as I do they can’t move here!’ \n\nFeeling rather uncomfortable by this confrontation, I was now somewhat confused. What do I need to know? And more importantly, why can’t we move here? \n\nBefore I can turn to Uncle Dave to ask him, the four men quickly halt their bickering and enter through the field gate entrance. Following the men into the cow field, the late-evening had turned dark by now, and not wanting to ruin my good trainers by stepping in any cowpats, I walked very cautiously and slowly – so slow in fact, I’d gotten separated from my uncle's group. Trying to follow the voices through the darkness and thick grass, I suddenly stop in my tracks, because in front of me, staring back with unblinking eyes, was a very large cow – so large, I at first mistook it for a bull. In the past, my Uncle Dave had warned me not to play in the cow fields, because if cows are with their calves, they may charge at you. \n\nSeeing this huge cow, staring stonewall at me, I really was quite terrified – because already knowing how freakishly fast cows can be, I knew if it charged at me, there was little chance I would outrun it. Thankfully, the cow stayed exactly where it was, before losing interest in me and moving on. I know it sounds ridiculous talking about my terrifying encounter with a cow, but I was a city boy after all. Although I regularly feds the cows on the family farm, these animals still felt somewhat alien to me, even after all these years.  \n\nBrushing off my close encounter, I continue to try and find my Uncle Dave. I eventually found them on the far side of the field’s corner. Approaching my uncle’s group, I then see they’re not alone. Standing by them were three more men and a woman, all dressed in farmer’s clothing. But surprisingly, my cousin Grainne was also with them. I go over to Grainne to say hello, but she didn’t even seem to realize I was there. She was too busy staring over at something, behind the group of farmers. Curious as to what Grainne was looking at, I move around to get a better look... and what I see is another cow – just a regular red cow, laying down on the grass. Getting out my phone to turn on the flashlight, I quickly realize this must be the cow that was giving birth. Its stomach was swollen, and there were patches of blood stained on the grass around it... But then I saw something else... \n\nOn the other side of this red cow, nestled in the grass beneath the bushes, was the calf... and rather sadly, it was stillborn... But what greatly concerned me, wasn’t that this calf was dead. What concerned me was its appearance... Although the calf’s head was covered in red, slimy fur, the rest of it wasn’t... The rest of it didn’t have any fur at all – just skin... And what made every single fibre of my body crawl, was that this calf’s body – its brittle, infant body... It belonged to a human... \n\nCurled up into a foetal position, its head was indeed that of a calf... But what I should have been seeing as two front and hind legs, were instead two human arms and legs - no longer or shorter than my own... \n\nFeeling terrified and at the same time, in disbelief, I leave the calf, or whatever it was to go back to Grainne – all the while turning to shine my flashlight on the calf, as though to see if it still had the same appearance. Before I can make it back to the group of adults, Grainne stops me. With a look of concern on her face, she stares silently back at me, before she says, ‘You’re not supposed to be here. It was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTelling her that Uncle Dave had brought me, I then ask what the hell that thing was... ‘I’m not allowed to tell you’ she says. ‘This was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTwenty or thirty-so minutes later, we were all standing around as though waiting for something - before the lights of a vehicle pull into the field and a man gets out to come over to us. This man wasn’t a farmer - he was some sort of veterinarian. Uncle Dave and the others bring him to tend to the calf’s mother, and as he did, me and Grainne were made to wait inside one of the men’s tractors. \n\nWe sat inside the tractor for what felt like hours. Even though it was summer, the night was very cold, and I was only wearing a soccer jersey and shorts. I tried prying Grainne for more information as to what was going on, but she wouldn’t talk about it – or at least, wasn’t allowed to talk about it. Luckily, my determination for answers got the better of her, because more than an hour later, with nothing but the cold night air and awkward silence to accompany us both, Grainne finally gave in... \n\n‘This happens every couple of years - to all the farms here... But we’re not supposed to talk about it. It brings bad luck.’ \n\nI then remembered something. When my dad said he wanted us to move here, my mum was dead against it. If anything, she looked scared just considering it... Almost afraid to know the answer, I work up the courage to ask Grainne... ‘Does my mum know about this?’ \n\nSat stiffly in the driver’s seat, Grainne cranes her neck round to me. ‘Of course she knows’ Grainne reveals. ‘Everyone here knows.’ \n\nIt made sense now. No wonder my mum didn’t want to move here. She never even seemed excited whenever we planned on visiting – which was strange to me, because my mum clearly loved her family. \n\nI then remembered something else... A couple of years ago, I remember waking up in the middle of the night inside the farmhouse, and I could hear the cows on the farm screaming. The screaming was so bad, I couldn’t even get back to sleep that night... The next morning, rushing through my breakfast to go play on the farm, Uncle Dave firmly tells me and my brothers to stay away from the cowshed... He didn’t even give an explanation. \n\nLater on that night, after what must have been a good three hours, my Uncle Dave and the others come over to the tractor. Shaking Uncle Dave’s hand, the veterinarian then gets in his vehicle and leaves out the field. I then notice two of the other farmers were carrying a black bag or something, each holding separate ends as they walked. I could see there was something heavy inside, and my first thought was they were carrying the dead calf – or whatever it was, away. Appearing as though everyone was leaving now, Uncle Dave comes over to the tractor to say we’re going back to the farmhouse, and that we would drop Grainne home along the way.  \n\nHaving taken Grainne home, we then make our way back along the country road, where both me and Uncle Dave sat in complete silence. Uncle Dave driving, just staring at the stretch of road in front of us – and me, staring silently at him. \n\nBy the time we get back to the farmhouse, it was two o’clock in the morning – and the farm was dead silent. Pulling up outside the farm, Uncle Dave switches off the car engine. Without saying a word, we both remain in silence. I felt too awkward to ask him what I had just seen, but I knew he was waiting for me to do so. Still not saying a word to one another, Uncle Dave turns from the driver’s seat to me... and he tells me everything Grainne wouldn’t... \n\n‘Don’t you see now why you can’t move here?’ he says. ‘There’s something wrong with this place, son. This place is cursed. Your mammy knows. She’s known since she was a wain. That’s why she doesn’t want you living here.’ \n\n‘Why does this happen?’ I ask him. \n\n‘This has been happening for generations, son. For hundreds of years, the animals in the county have been giving birth to these things.’ The way my Uncle Dave was explaining all this to me, it was almost like a confession – like he’d wanted to tell the truth about what’s been happening here all his life... ‘It’s not just the cows. It’s the pigs. The sheep. The horses, and even the dogs’... \n\nThe dogs? \n\n‘It’s always the same. They have the head, as normal, but the body’s always different.’ \n\nIt was only now, after a long and terrifying night, that I suddenly started to become emotional - that and I was completely exhausted. Realizing this was all too much for a young boy to handle, I think my Uncle Dave tried to put my mind at ease...  \n\n‘Don’t you worry, son... They never live.’ \n\nAlthough I wanted all the answers, I now felt as though I knew far too much... But there was one more thing I still wanted to know... What do they do with the bodies? \n\n‘Don’t you worry about it, son. Just tell your mammy that you know – but don’t go telling your brothers or your daddy now... She never wanted them knowing.’ \n\nBy the next morning, and constantly rethinking everything that happened the previous night, I look around the farmhouse for my mum. Thankfully, she was alone in her bedroom folding clothes, and so I took the opportunity to talk to her in private. Entering her room, she asks me how it was seeing a calf being born for the first time. Staring back at her warm smile, my mouth opens to make words, but nothing comes out – and instantly... my mum knows what’s happened. \n\n‘I could kill your Uncle Dave!’ she says. ‘He said it was going to be a normal birth!’ \n\nBreaking down in tears right in front of her, my mum comes over to comfort me in her arms. \n\n‘’It’s ok, chicken. There’s no need to be afraid.’ \n\nAfter she tried explaining to me what Grainne and Uncle Dave had already told me, her comforting demeanour suddenly turns serious... Clasping her hands upon each side of my arms, my mum crouches down, eyes-level with me... and with the most serious look on her face I’d ever seen, she demands of me, ‘Listen chicken... Whatever you do, don’t you dare go telling your brothers or your dad... They can never know. It’s going to be our little secret. Ok?’ \n\nStill with tears in my eyes, I nod a silent yes to her. ‘Good man yourself’ she says.  \n\nWe went back home to England a week later... I never told my brothers or my dad the truth of what I saw – of what really happens on those farms... And I refused to ever step foot inside of County Donegal again... \n\nBut here’s the thing... I recently went back to Ireland, years later in my adulthood... and on my travels, I learned my mum and Uncle Dave weren’t telling me the whole truth...  \n\nThis curse... It wasn’t regional... And sometimes...  \n\n...They do live. "

        "selftext": "I stood in front of the closet, the door yawning open with a groan like something dying slow. Inside, bathed in the sickly flicker of a naked bulb, sat countless of enormous glass jars. Each was filled with a thick, amber fluid that clung to the sides like syrup. Suspended inside them were heads—real ones. Human. Perfectly preserved, eyes open, skin pale and bloated, mouths slightly agape as if caught mid-scream. They hovered in the fluid like grotesque snow globes.\n\nThis was my morning ritual. But it never felt like my choice. I watched my own hand reach up, fingers trembling slightly, hovering indecisively. It was like I was just a passenger. Some deeper thing inside me decided who I’d be today. I never understood it, never questioned it. Everything in my mind crackled like a broken transmission—my thoughts flickering in and out, never settling. Memories surfaced only in brief, distorted flashes, as if viewed through shattered glass. Faces, words, entire moments twisted into static before vanishing again, leaving behind nothing but a hum of confusion. Like my life was being dubbed over by someone else’s tape. At this point I didn’t fight it anymore. I just waited to become.\n\nMy body wasn’t strong. It was rail-thin, skin clinging to bone like wet paper. I moved stiffly, like a puppet with damp strings. My limbs worked, sure, but they felt… borrowed. My arms were long, marked with scars, strange bruises, and patches of something grey-green that smelled like rot. My legs dragged slightly. Each step made a squelching sound, like I was walking through something too soft. But I moved. The thing inside made sure of that.\n\nYesterday’s head still sat off to the side, in its own cracked jar. Not on the shelf with the others. It didn’t belong there.\n\nEllis Thorn.\n\nHis name still echoed somewhere in the back of my mind like a warning I was already ignoring. His head bobbed in the murky liquid, mouth curled in a smug half-smile. His eyes were wide open, and they watched me like he was still alive in there.\n\nWhen I wore Ellis, everything became smooth and slick. The voice I spoke with was calm, almost soothing—perfect for confession. I walked the streets whispering blessings into the ears of the weak, the broken, the devout. Then I took them—one by one—into basements, alleyways, into pews behind locked doors. I turned scripture into a weapon. Replaced holy water with acid. Cut a woman open from collarbone to pelvis while softly reciting Psalm 23. And through it all, I felt it—the euphoria, the holiness in the desecration. The feeling of becoming something divine through violence. \n\n\nMy hand, steadier now, rose toward the middle jar. A woman’s head floated inside, her features locked in a frozen rictus of rage and agony.\n\nMy hand hovered in front of the jar for a few seconds, fingers grazing the cold glass, tracing the fog that bloomed from inside. I didn’t need to open it. Not today. I already knew what was in there—what she was. Just looking at her was enough to stir it all back up. Her name was Dr. Miriam Vale.\n\nThe memory crept in slow, like rot through floorboards.\n\nHer head drifted in the thick amber fluid, her hair unraveling around her like strands of oil-soaked seaweed. Her mouth was sewn shut with thick black wire, looped so tightly it had sliced through both cheeks, exposing her molars in a grotesque grin. Her eye sockets were hollow, but not empty—inside them twitched something pale and soft, wormlike, still alive. Or maybe just refusing to die. Her skin was swollen and marbled with purples and greens, like a body pulled from a river. A thick, clumsy suture traced a line from one ear to the other, holding together the top of her skull like the lid of a broken jar.\n\nI didn’t need to lift the jar or touch the flesh. I’d worn her. I remembered.\n\nIt started with the sting—nerves threading into mine like hot wires. Then her mind poured in, thick and heavy, like sludge through a funnel. She had been a surgeon. Respected. Applauded. A pioneer. But something had broken in her, long before I ever touched her. She stopped seeing patients and started seeing… projects.\n\nThey brought her into the hospitals like a ghost. No credentials. No records. Just a name whispered by people too scared to say more. She worked in places no one should have access to—morgues, abandoned wings, under lit basements where the flicker of fluorescent lights barely cut through the dark. I saw it all.\n\nShe didn’t just cut people open. She rearranged them.\n\nA boy with lungs stitched into his abdomen. A woman whose arms were replaced with the legs of a corpse. Organs mixed and matched like a puzzle. Eyes where ears should be. Mouths in stomachs. A man whose ribcage had been bent backward and reassembled into a crown around his spine.\n\nShe did it all without anesthesia. She said pain was proof the soul was still inside.\n\nI remember standing over one of her tables, hands moving without my permission, sewing a second face onto someone’s chest. I remember her joy—the thrill that flooded me when something moved that shouldn’t have. When something screamed without a mouth.\n\nShe called it evolution. She called it art.\n\nAnd for five long days, I called it me.\n\nEven now, with her sealed in glass, I still feel her in the nerves behind my eyes. A twitch in my fingers. A whisper behind my thoughts. I haven’t worn her in over a week, but sometimes I wake up thinking I’m back in that room, the floor sticky with blood, the walls breathing like lungs.\n\nDr. Miriam Vale doesn’t let go easy.\n\nBut today felt off, like the air had shifted just slightly out of tune. The silence in the room wasn’t empty—it was waiting. Even the bulb above me sputtered slower, its rhythm hesitant, like it too sensed a boundary being approached. \n\nMy hand rose again, but not with the same limp obedience as before. It moved with a kind of gravity, like the decision had already been made somewhere deep in the architecture of me. Somewhere I’d never had access to.\n\nJar No. 27\n\nThis jar sat lower than the others. Closer to the floor. Almost like it had been forgotten—or hidden. Dust clung to the glass and the amber inside was darker than the rest, nearly brown, like molasses left too long in the heat. The thing inside was obscured, shadowed, but it didn’t matter. I knew.\n\nThis was the one.\n\nMy fingers rested against the jar. I felt the hum before I heard it, like something behind the fluid had just woken up. A vibration in my bones, subtle but steady. The way thunder sometimes comes before the lightning.\n\nI didn’t know their name. Didn’t need to. Some part of me had been saving this one. For last. For when it mattered. For now.\n\nMy other hand rose and found the lid, and as I twisted it, the seal broke with a wet pop. A small bubble rose from inside, like breath held too long finally released.\n\nThe hum came instantly—low and bone-deep, like recognition. The fluid inside quivered, almost excited. Something pressed back against the glass, eager. Hungry.\n\nLike the other heads before, it was never a choice—just its turn.\n\nBut as the scent hit me—thick, metallic, sweet—I felt it. That pull. That flicker. That quiet click of something unlocking behind my eyes.\n\nThere was no fear. Just the question.\n\nWho will I be this time?"

        "selftext": "It had been years since I celebrated Easter, and I've certainly never celebrated it like this. \n\nIt started on the first week of April, though I can't remember exactly when. I had been keeping my nephew that weekend, kids five and he's pretty cool. He was excited about Easter, as Kids that age usually are, and it's a big deal in my brother's house. When he came to pick him up, they asked me if I wanted to come decorate Easter baskets that weekend but I shook my head.\n\n\"Sorry, bud. I don't really do Easter.\"\n\nKevin, my nephew, looked a little sad, \"But, why not Uncle Tom?\"\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but one look at my brother made me think better of it. We had both grown up in a household that was very religious and while he and his wife were still very much a part of that world, I had gone in the opposite direction. I didn't really have much to do with that part of my childhood, and it was sometimes a sticking point between my brother and I. I love Kevin, but I really didn't want to dredge up a lot of old memories again. I think my brother was hoping I would find my way back to the faith on my own, but there wasn't a lot of chance there.\n\n\"He's got to work that day, right Tom?\" my brother asked, giving me an out.\n\n\"Yeah, \" I said, nodding along, \"Sorry, kiddo. Lots of work to do before Easter.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Kevin said, looking sad as he and his Dad headed out.\n\nSo after he went home I was cleaning up and found a blue plastic egg between the couch cushions. It was just a plastic egg, nothing special, but I couldn't recall having ever seen it before. I figured it belonged to Kevin, and put it aside in case he wanted it back. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I have to wonder now if it was the first one.\n\nA couple of days later, I flopped down on the couch after a long day at work and heard the crackle of plastic under the cushion. I popped up, thinking I had broken the remote or something, but as I lifted the couch cushion I found two more plastic eggs. One was green and one was blue and they were both empty and broken in half. I put them back together and set them on the counter with the other one, shaking my head as I flipped through the usual bunch of shows on Netflix.\n\nWhen Friday came around I was ready for the weekend. It had been a long week and I was ready for two days of relaxation. I opened the cabinet where I usually kept my hamburger helper and stepped back as four of the colored plastic eggs came falling out. They broke open as they hit the dirty linoleum and I was thankful they were empty. I grimaced as I bent down to get them, a yellow, a red, and two green ones, and squinted at them. I had opened this cabinet yesterday and there hadn't been any eggs in them. What the hell was going on here? I took out the beef stroganoff and set to cooking, but the eggs were never far from my mind. I thought about calling my brother but shook my head as I decided against it. The kiddo was just playing a little joke, maybe pretending to be the Easter Bunny. He would laugh the next time he came over and say he had got me and we'd both have a chuckle about it.\n\nThe eggs were on my mind as I went to bed that night, the pile growing on the counter, and I thought that was why I had the dream.\n\nIt was late, around one or two, and I had fallen asleep on the couch. I woke up slowly, the TV dimmed as it asked me if I was still watching Mad Men. I wasn’t quite sure whether I was actually awake or asleep. My apartment was dark, the only light coming from my dim television and the fast-moving light from between my blinds, and as I lay there trying to figure out if I was awake or not, I heard a noise. It was weird, like listening to a heavy piece of furniture bump around, and as it galumped behind my couch, it sang a little song. It wasn't a very pleasant rendition, either, and it sent chills down my spine.\n\nHere comes Peter Cotton Tail\n\nThump Thump Thump\n\nComin' down the bunny trail\n\nThump Thump Thump\n\nHippity, Hoppity, Easters on its Way.\n\nI turned my head a little, seeing a shadow rising up the wall, and something old crept into me. It was a memory from so long ago, a half-remembered bit of trauma that refused to die. My brother and I had been in our bed, listening to that same sound as it came up the hall. It was like a nightmare, the voice that sang something so similar, and as I sat up and prepared to yell at whoever was in my house to get out, I shuddered awake and found myself alone in my apartment. The TV was still on, and the lights still flickered by behind the blinds, but the place was empty besides me. \n\nThat day I found no less than ten plastic eggs.\n\nThere was no real rhyme or reason to them. I found four in the kitchen, two in the living room, two more in my bedroom, and two in the bathroom. The ones in the bathroom definitely hadn't been there yesterday. One was in the sink and one was on the lid of the toilet. I would have noticed them for sure, and that made me think that my dream might have been more than that.\n\nUnlike the first few eggs I had found, these eggs had a message in them. It was a slip of paper, like a fortune in a fortune cookie, and it seemed to be lines from the song I had dreamed about the night before. Hippity Hoppity and Happy Easter Day and Peter Cotton Tale were spread throughout, and it gave me an odd twinge to see the whole poem there in bits and pieces. I remembered it, of course I did. She used to hum it all the time, and it drove our parents crazy. \n\nI called my brother that afternoon, wanting to ask about the eggs.\n\n\"Thomas, always good to hear from you.\"\n\n\"Hey, weird question. Did Kev leave some stuff behind when he came to hang out?\"\n\n\"Stuff?\" my brother asked, \"What kind of stuff?\"\n\n\"Plastic eggs. I've found about twenty of them sitting around my apartment since the first and I don't know where they are coming from.\"\n\nI heard the chair in his office creak as he leaned back and just could picture him scratching his chin.\n\n\"No, we don't usually do the plastic eggs. We have the eggs from the hens so we usually just color those. Speaking of, we're coloring eggs next week and I know Kevin would really like it if his favorite Uncle was there.\"\n\nI inhaled sharply, biting back what I wanted to say to him, not wanting to have this conversation again, \"Mark, you know I can't.\"\n\nMy brother clicked his tongue, \"It's been years, are you still on about that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah I am still on about that. I don't understand how you aren't.\"\n\n\"I miss Catherine as much as you do, Tom, but you have to move on. What happened to her was awful, but you can't hold it against the world forever.\"\n\n\"No, what's awful is that you continue to bring Kevin to the same church where that monster held congregation every weekend. Who knows if they got all the filth out of there when they took Brother Mike.\"\n\n\"They,\" he started to raise his voice, but I heard him get up and close the office door before getting control of himself, \"They never proved that Brother Mike was the one that took her. It's not fair to turn your back on God because of one bad apple.\"\n\nI was quiet for a long moment. I wanted to rail at him, to ask him how he could possibly still have any faith in a church that had made a man like Michael Harris. I wanted to say these things, but I bit my tongue, just like always.\n\n\"I won't celebrate Easter, Mark. I'm sorry if that offends your sensibilities, but my faith died when they found out what Brother Mike did to those kids.\"\n\n\"They never found Catherine's body among the,\" but I hung up on him.\n\nI was done talking about it. \n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nAfter another week of finding eggs, I had probably collected about thirty of them in all. After the pile started spilling out over the edges of the countertop, I started throwing them away. They clearly weren't Kevins so there was no reason for me to keep them. The notes inside began to become less cutesy as well if ever they had been. The Easter poem about Peter Cotton Tale took on a darker quality. Lines like Through your windows, through your doors, here to give what you adore, were in some when I put them together but it was the one that talked about taking things that got my attention. It took me a while to get it together, but once I did I could feel my hands shaking.\n\nPeter has fun and games in store.\n\nFor children young and old galore\n\nSo hop along and find what your heart desires.\n\nI started dreading finding them. This was no longer a cute game that a kid was playing. This was beginning to feel like the antics of a stalker.\n\nBefore you ask, I went the day after my phone call with my brother and had the locks changed. My landlord was pretty understanding, it happened sometimes, and I felt pretty safe after the locks on the front and back door were changed. I thought that would be the end of it, no more weird little presents, but when I got up the next day and found ten eggs stacked neatly along the back lip of my couch, I knew it wasn't over.\n\nThe longer I thought about these eggs, the more I remembered something I had been trying to forget.\n\nThe longer they lived in my brain, the more I thought about Catherine. \n\nCatherine was the middle child. Mark was the big brother, about four years older than me, and I was the baby of the family. Catherine was slap in the middle, two years older than me but two years younger than Mark, and she was a bit rebellious. Our parents were strictly religious, the kind of religion that didn't celebrate holidays if there wasn't a religious bend. Christmas was all about Christ and they were of the opinion that he was the only gift we needed. They gave us clothes and fruit, but Catherine always asked for toys. Thanksgiving was okay, but Halloween was right out. \"We won't be celebrating the Devil's mischief in this house,\" my Dad always said. Catherine, however, didn't like missing out on free candy. Candy was something else that was strictly limited, so when Catherine learned that people were just giving it away, she knew she had to get in on it. \n\nCatherine started making her own costumes and sneaking out on Halloween, and Dad would never catch her out with the other kids in the neighborhood. She always hid the candy, saying they must have just missed her, but the wrappers Mark and I found were harder to make excuses about. She shared, she was kind and loved us very much, and neither of us ever sold her out or gave up the candy.\n\nEaster, however, was another holiday that she and my parents argued about. \n\nMom and Dad were unmoving on the fact that Easter was about Christ, but Catherine said it could also be about candy and eggs and the Easter Bunny. \n\nCatherine, for as long as I could remember, loved the idea of the Easter Bunny. She read books about him at school, far from my parent's prying eyes. She talked to her friends about it and learned about egg hunts and chocolate rabbits. She ingested anything she could about the holiday and it became a kind of mania in her. She didn't understand why we could color eggs or have Easter baskets or do any of the things her friends did, and it seemed like every year the fights between her and my parents got worse and worse. They would forbid her to color eggs, they threw away several stuffed rabbits she got from friends, and they wouldn't allow any book in the house with an anthropomorphic rabbit on it. \n\nThen, when I was eight and she was ten, something happened.\n\nIt was something I thought I remembered, but I wondered if I remembered all of it.\n\nA week before easter, I woke up to find the floor of my room covered in plastic eggs. \n\nSome of the fear I felt was left over from the dream I'd had the night before. Was it a dream, I wondered. I wasn't so sure. I couldn't sleep on the couch anymore, not after that night I had woken up to the weird little poem, but as I lay in my bed, I dreamed I could hear that strange galumphing sound.\n\nThump thump thump\n\nIt would come up the hall, the soft sound of something moving on its back legs.\n\nThump thump thump\n\nI had pulled the covers up under my chin, shaking like a child who fears a monster, and as I pulled my knees up and put my head under the covers, I heard it. It was the song, the song that took me back to that long ago day as I lay under my covers and hoped it would stop. I can still hear Mark's raspy breathing as he tries not to cry, but his fear was as palpable as mine. \n\nHere comes Peter Cotton's Tale\n\nthump thump thump\n\nHoppin down the bunny trail\n\nThump thump thump\n\nHippity, Hoppity, Easters On Its Way!\n\nI lay there as a grown man, hearing that song and shivering. Something else happened too, something came back that I just couldn't catch in my teeth. Something happened that night when I was a kid. Something happened that I've blocked out, but the harder I try to remember it, the slipperier it gets.\n\nThe morning I woke up to all those eggs on the floor was the morning I called Doctor Gabriel.\n\nDoctor Gabriel was a therapist I had seen off and on over the years. He had helped me make peace with Catherine's loss but hadn't managed to make me come to a point where I could come to peace with my parent's religion. I would never be able to do that. The religion was what had killed Catherine and I couldn't forgive them or my brother for clinging to it. I knew that the church had helped him through our sister's loss, but I couldn't find that peace.\n\nI hadn't seen him in two years, but the poem in the eggs that day made me itch to call the police.\n\nCome along the trail, my boy\n\nCome and find your long-lost joy.\n\nHippity, Hoppity, Catherine's waiting there.\n\nDoctor Gabriel got me in for an emergency appointment and as I lay on the couch he asked me how things had been since my last appointment.\n\n\"Something is happening to me, Doc. Something is happening and it makes me think about Catherine.\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell me what's been going on?\" he said, tapping his pencil on the paper.\n\n\"Someone is leaving eggs in my apartment. They are hiding them for me to find and they have messages in them, messages I feel are becoming threatening.\"\n\n\"Is this something real or is it something that only you are seeing?\"\n\n\"It has to be real. I keep throwing them away and the bags are full. Other people can see them so it can't just be something I'm imagining. The things that are happening though remind me of the night Catherine was taken. I need to know what happened that night. I need to see that memory that I have locked away.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Doctor Gabriel asked, \"Those memories are something that you have avoided for a long time, Tom.\"\n\nI had told him most of it, but Doctor Gabriel knew I had been holding back. He knew that once I had a sister. He knew that when she was ten she went missing. He knew that the police had searched the church and discovered that the pastor, Brother Michael, had been responsible for the deaths of twelve of his parishioner's children over four years. The police interrogated him for hours until he finally led them to the remains of ten children that he had buried in the woods behind the pastor's house next to the church. The state of South Carolina gave him the death penalty and in two thousand and ten, they killed him via lethal injection. \n\nThe body of Catherine was never discovered but my Dad testified that Michael had been spending a lot of time with her at church. He had keys to our house, he had babysat us on multiple occasions, and when the cops could find no evidence of a break-in, they ran down a short list of people who could have gotten in. They found Pastor Michael with a child in his truck when they came to question him, a boy I went to school with who could have been his latest victim. This had given them the cause they needed to search his house which was how they found the evidence they needed to hold him and how they got him to confess to eleven of the murders.\n\nEleven, but never to Catherine's murder.\n\nHe went under the needle saying how he never hurt her.\n\nAll of these things Doctor Gabriel knew, but I needed him to pull out the thing that I had repressed for all these years.\n\n\"I need you to put me under, Doc. I need to know what I can't seem to get hold of.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Doctor Gabriel asked, \"You've always been opposed to this sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I think I need to know now,\" I told him, \"Because I think that whatever is happening now has something to do with it.\"\n\nDoctor Gabriel said he would try and as he got me into what he called a receptive state he talked about where I wanted to go back to.\n\n\"Let's take you back to Easter, two thousand and three. You are eight years old, living with your parents and your siblings. Go there in your mind. I want you to remember something, a trigger from then. A smell or a sound or something to help guide you. Do you have it?\" \n\nI nodded, remembering the smell of the popcorn that Catherine used to make every afternoon as a snack.\n\n\"Okay, let that take you back, let it bring you to where you need to be. What do you see?\"\n\nFor a moment I saw nothing, just lay there thinking of popcorn, but then I remembered something and changed the smell slightly in my mind. Catherine's popcorn was always slightly burnt, she couldn't operate the microwave as well as Mark, and as I lay there smelling burnt popcorn, I fixed on the moment I wanted. It was one of the last times I remembered eating burnt popcorn, and the taste of it suddenly filled my mouth.\n\n\"I'm on the couch watching a Bibleman VHS tape and eating popcorn. Normally I would share it with Catherine, but she and my parents are fighting again. Catherine wants to go to a Spring dance at school but my parents won't let her. They say she can go to the dance at church, but now they're yelling about Easter instead. Catherine is saying it's unfair that she can't go to the dance and it's unfair that she can't celebrate Easter the way she wants. She wants baskets and eggs and chocolates and my Dad is yelling that those kinds of things are for pagans and agnostics. He won't let her make the holiday about anything but Christ and she's telling him how she won't celebrate any Easter if she doesn't get her way. She storms off and leaves me on the couch, my parents still fuming and talking in low voices.\"\n\n\"Good, good,\" I hear the scratch of his pencil, \"What else do you remember?\"\n\n\"I went to Catherine's room to make sure she was okay and I saw her praying.\"\n\n\"What was she praying for?\" Doctor Gabriel asked.\n\n\"I thought she might be praying to God like we usually do, but she was praying to the Easter Bunny for some reason.\"\n\nThe Doctor made a thoughtful sound and told me to go on.\n\n\"She prayed for the kind of Easter she wants, the kind of Easter she's always wanted. She asks him to come and show her parents he's real and to help her get the Easter she deserves. Then she noticed me and I thought she was gonna kick me out, but she actually invited me to come pray with her. She told me that if we prayed, The Easter Bunny would come and give us a great Easter, better than we had ever had.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I was eight, I had been raised in the church, and I told her it didn't feel right. I closed the door and left her to it.\"\n\n\"Did you tell your parents?\" Docter Gabriel asked.\n\n\"No, but I wish I had.\"\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"We ate dinner, we went to bed, life went on. My sister didn't talk to my parents much and they seemed to want an apology. She wouldn't and she went to bed without supper a few nights. It was life in general for us, but the next thing I remember vividly is waking up a few nights later.\"\n\n\"What woke you up?\"\n\n\"A thumping sound, like something heavy jumping instead of walking. It sang the Peter Cottontale song and as it came down the hall, I remember getting under my covers and being scared.\"\n\n\"Did you see it?\" he asked, and I felt my head shake.\n\n\"I was under the covers. I think Mark was too. We were both still kids and it was scary. I,\" I paused, feeling the slippery bit coming up, \"I remember hearing something.\"\n\n\"What did you hear?\"\n\n\"I,\" it slipped, but I grabbed for it, \"I,\" I lost it again, but I caught it by the tail before it could escape. I dug my fingers in and held on, drawing it out as it came into focus, \"I heard Catherine. She came out of her room and I heard her talk to it.\"\n\n\"What did she say?\" Doctor Gabriel asked, clearly becoming more interested.\n\n\"She asked if he was the Easter Bunny. He said he was and he was here to grant her prayers. He said he was going to take her to a place where she could have her perfect Easter. She sounded happy and she said that was all she ever wanted.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" he asked, almost like he was afraid to ask it, \"Did this person she was talking to sound like the Pastor of the church, the one they say murdered her?\"\n\nI thought about it, and felt my shake again, \"No, no he didn't. I don't think I had ever heard of this person before. He hopped off and I think he must have been carrying her. When he hopped off, it sounded the same as the hopping I keep hearing in my apartment.\"\n\nScritch Scratch Scritch went the pencil.\n\n\"Tom, do you believe that whatever this is that took your sister is coming back to harass you or something?\" \n\n\"I don't know, I just know that's what it seems like.\"\n\nSomething I hadn't told him, something I realized as he was bringing me out, was that if it was some kind of real Easter Bunny, then there was only one explanation.\n\nIf it was coming after me, then someone had to be calling it.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nI called my brother and asked him to meet me somewhere, somewhere we could talk.\n\n\"The park down the road from Mom and Dad's old house,\" I said and, to my surprise, he agreed.\n\nWe met around five, the sun sinking low, and he seemed ill at ease as I pulled up. He was sitting on the swing set, the park abandoned this late in the afternoon, and I joined him on the one beside him. We sat for a moment, just swinging back and forth before Mark sighed and asked what I wanted. We didn't come together often, and it was clearly making him a little uncomfortable.\n\n\"I need to know what you remember from the night Catherine disappeared.\"\n\nMark blinked at me, \"What?\"\n\n\"The night Catherine disappeared. What do you remember?\"\n\nHe looked away, a clear tell that he was about to lie to me, and soldiered on, \"Nothing. I was asleep. I didn't see,\"\n\n\"Bullshit, Mark. I heard you, you were just as scared as I was. I know you heard something. I'm hoping it's the same thing I remember so I can stop telling myself I made it up.\"\n\n\"I,\" he started to lie again but seemed to feel guilty about it, \"I...okay, okay, I was awake. At least I think I was. I don't know, it was like a nightmare. I heard that Rabbit song that Catherine used to sing all the time, I heard that heavy whump sound as it hopped up the hall, and then I heard her talking to it. When they said that Pastor Michael had taken her, I thought it must have been him and I figured I was dreaming. Is that...what do you remember?\"\n\n\"The same,\" I said, looking into the setting sun despite the way it made me squint, \"I remember the Peter Rabbit song and the creepy way he sang it, and after the session I had with Doctor Gabriel today, I remembered her talking to him.\"\n\nWe swung for a minute, the chains clinking rustily before he spoke again.\n\n\"So why bring it up? It was Pastor Michael, everybody knows that.\"\n\n\"I don't think it was,\" I said, and it felt like someone else was saying it, \"I think the Easter Bunny came and gave her exactly what she'd been praying for.\"\n\nI expected him to tell me I was crazy, but he drew in a breath and shook his head, \"You remember her doing that too, huh?\"\n\n\"I saw her more than once. She prayed to that Rabbit like it was Jesus himself.\"\n\n\"Don't be blasphemous,\" he said, offhandedly, \"There's no such thing as the Easter Bunny. It's made up.\"\n\n\"Everything is made up,\" I said, \"Until someone decides it isn't. Regardless, something has been leaving these eggs in my apartment and they have some pretty cryptic messages in them.\"\n\n\"Which means?\" he asked.\n\n\"It means that someone probably asked this thing to help me have a real Easter, and I think I might know who.\"\n\nHe gave me a warning look, but I was pretty sure I knew already.\n\n\"Keven seemed pretty upset when his favorite Uncle couldn't celebrate Easter with his family. He loves the Easter Bunny, he loves Easter, and maybe he loves them enough to ask them for help.\"\n\n\"He loves Santa Clause and Jesus too. Have either of them visited you?\"\n\nI shrugged, \"Maybe he never asked.\"\n\n\"This is crazy,\" Mark said, darkness setting around us as evening took hold, \"This is the craziest thing I have ever heard. Why would he do that? What possible reason could he have for doing something like that?\"\n\n\"He's five, Mark. Things that make sense to kids don't mean much to us. Monsters under the bed, lucky pennies, sidewalk cracks, holding your breath past a graveyard, hell, childhood is basically all ritual if you think about it.\"\n\nMark opened his mouth to say something, but his phone went off then and he fished it out and let the thought sigh out, \"It's Mellissa. She's probably wondering why I'm not home yet.\"\n\nHe answered the phone, and he had started to tell her something when she spoke over him. Her voice was shrill and scared and the longer she talked the worse Mark looked. His jaw trembled, his eyes got wide, and he was up and walking to his truck before she had finished. I asked him what was going on, and tried to figure out what had happened, but he didn't tell me until his truck was running and he was half out of the parking lot. I had to almost stand in front of his truck, and he yelled at me before juking around me and speeding away.\n\n\"Kevin is gone. He just disappeared out of the backyard and Mellissa doesn't know where he is.\"\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThat was about a week ago, and I'm still not sure what to do.\n\nKevin is gone. The trucks he was playing with in the backyard are still there, but my nephew seems to have disappeared without a trace. I stayed up all night helping Mark search the woods, but the police are absolutely stumped as to where he could have gone. It was like the ground just swallowed him up, but I didn't find out where he had gone until I got home.\n\nIt was morning, the sun just coming up, as I stepped into my apartment. I had intended to catch an hour or two before going out again, but the basket on my table froze me in place. It was a floral print, with lots of pastels and soft colors, and the basket was full of technicolor green grass. Sitting in the grass was a picture, something that had been snapped on an old Polaroid camera, and a single plastic egg.\n\nIn the egg was a poem, a poem that gave me chills.\n\nKevin and Peter Cotton Tail\n\nHave hoped down the bunny trail\n\nHippity, Hoppity, where he’s gone to stay\n\nHe lives with Mr Cotton Tail\n\nHere with Catherine, beyond the vale\n\nHippity, Hoppity, Happy Easter Day\n\nThe picture was of Kevin and a grown woman, a woman who looked a lot like Catherine. Her hair was a little grayer, and her eyes had a few more crows feet, but the resemblance was uncanny. She was smiling, but it was the kind of smile you get to cover a fear response. Kevin was with her, looking scared and a little ruffled, and he wasn’t even bothering with a smile. At the bottom, written in heavy sharpy, was Kevin's first Easter with Aunt Catherine.\n\nI'm going to the police, but I don't know how much good they will be. \n\nI just pray this is some sick bastard that kidnaps kids and not…the alternative is too weird to even consider.\n\nI hope we can find Kevin before it's too late, before he’s just another victim of this sadistic rabbit and his holiday kidnapping spree. "

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Awakening the Titan\n\nThe year was 2025, and humanity’s thirst for knowledge had finally led them to the lost city of Atlantis. Beneath the waves of the Atlantic, long forgotten secrets waited to be unearthed. Dr. Abigail Foster, a brilliant archaeologist, led the expedition to uncover Atlantis' greatest mysteries. Among the ruins of the city, they discovered a massive chamber, where ancient texts spoke of a protector — a colossal tortoise named Gamera.\n\nThe ancient texts described Gamera as the guardian of the universe, created by the Atlanteans through a series of advanced, forbidden experiments. The creature was meant to protect Earth from any existential threat, a being capable of unimaginable power. And now, Gamera was waking up. The city’s isolation had preserved him for millennia, and his slumber was ending.\n\nThe moment Gamera’s eyes opened, a tremor ran through the earth. The massive tortoise-like creature, towering above the ruins, emerged from its dormant state. A roar filled the air, a sound that sent waves crashing across the shores, and the skies turned red as Gamera unfurled his massive limbs.\n\n\"Looks like the party's just begun,\" Gamera muttered to himself in a deep, gravelly voice, the words rumbling like thunder. Though an ancient guardian, he spoke with the cocky tone of someone who had seen too much to be intimidated by anything.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The Nightmarish Foe\n\nAcross the globe, in the dead of night, another beast awoke. Gyaos, a terrifying, bat-like pteranodon, soared into the air, its massive wings casting an ominous shadow. Its blood-red eyes gleamed with hunger, and from its throat came a monstrous screech, the signal of its insatiable thirst for blood.\n\nGyaos, though capable of flight and shooting devastating lasers from its mouth, had a deep, animalistic hunger that made it even more dangerous. Unlike most creatures, it was not just a mindless predator; it was a force of destruction, a creature that had been feeding on the blood of humanity for centuries, only to be reawakened after a failed attempt by humans to study the ancient species.\n\nAs Gyaos flew over cities, its red beams lit up the sky, incinerating everything in their path. Entire buildings crumbled, and people fled in terror, unable to outrun the deadly laser. Gyaos was a creature of the night, its hunger only growing with each passing moment.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The First Encounter\n\nDr. Abigail Foster stood on the balcony of a research facility, watching in horror as Gyaos’ red laser beam tore through the city skyline. It was impossible to believe what she was seeing. In a desperate attempt to stop the carnage, she ordered the facility’s defense systems to fire everything they had, but nothing worked.\n\nThen, as if on cue, the earth beneath her feet shook, and a voice filled the air.\n\n\"Looks like you’ve got a real problem on your hands, doc.\"\n\nAbigail spun around to see Gamera standing outside, towering over the facility. His massive head dipped down to meet her eye level.\n\n\"I was built to protect humanity,\" Gamera continued, \"but I’m not here to clean up your mess. You better make sure you don’t get in my way.\"\n\nDespite his cocky tone, Abigail noticed something. There was fear in his eyes, something primal that even Gamera couldn’t hide.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Gamera’s Challenge\n\nGamera flew into the night sky, his massive body creating a gust of wind as he launched himself into the air. From his mouth, a stream of fire shot out, enough to singe the sky. His massive wings spread wide, allowing him to glide through the darkness, eyes fixed on the approaching Gyaos.\n\n\"Alright, buddy, you’ve had your fun,\" Gamera called out, his voice taunting. \"Now it’s my turn.\"\n\nThe battle between the two giants was unlike anything the world had ever seen. Gyaos’ blood-red lasers clashed with Gamera’s fiery breath, each attack powerful enough to level entire buildings. Gamera took to the skies, his body glowing with energy as he shot jet streams of fire from the holes in his body, creating a blazing trail as he dodged Gyaos’ deadly beams.\n\n\"You want blood, huh?\" Gamera laughed. \"I’ll show you blood!\"\n\nWith a final roar, Gamera unleashed a devastating fireball that collided with Gyaos, sending the creature crashing into the earth below. However, Gyaos wasn’t defeated. It quickly recovered and, enraged, began to charge up for its final attack.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: A Fearful Guardian\n\nGamera hovered in the air, breathing heavily. Despite his cocky attitude, he knew that Gyaos was no easy opponent. His confidence was starting to waver. As he prepared to dive into another attack, something in the distance caught his eye: a massive spacecraft, descending toward the earth.\n\n\"Great,\" Gamera muttered. \"Just what we needed. More problems.\"\n\nThe spacecraft was filled with space-faring Gyaos, a terrifying version of the creature, larger and more powerful than anything humanity had seen before. As the first of the space Gyaos landed, its menacing eyes glowed a bright red, its body bathed in an otherworldly light.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6: A Hero’s Choice\n\nDr. Foster watched in disbelief as Gamera engaged with the space Gyaos. She knew she had to help, but how could she? She had no weapons capable of taking down these monsters.\n\nGamera, sensing her doubt, looked back toward her. \"You’re scared, aren’t you?\" he said with a smirk.\n\n\"I… I don’t know what to do!\" Abigail shouted.\n\n\"Well, I’m not exactly looking for a sidekick,\" Gamera replied. \"But if you want to survive, you better keep up.\"\n\nTogether, they devised a plan. Gamera would use his flying ability to take on the space Gyaos while Abigail tried to hack into the spacecraft’s systems to disable their reinforcements. The odds were stacked against them, but they had no choice. The fate of humanity rested in their hands.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: The Final Battle\n\nGamera and the space Gyaos clashed in a final, explosive battle. Fire and lasers filled the sky as the two monsters fought with everything they had. Gamera’s fireballs collided with the space Gyaos’ energy blasts, each one causing shockwaves that rippled across the earth.\n\nAbigail, working quickly, hacked into the spacecraft and triggered a self-destruct sequence. She watched as the massive ship exploded in a fiery blaze, sending pieces of debris falling to earth. But the victory was bittersweet. Gamera was exhausted, his once-shiny shell now scorched from the battle.\n\n\"You did it, doc,\" Gamera said, his voice weaker now. \"We’re not out of the woods yet, but you did your part.\"\n\nAbigail smiled, a sense of relief washing over her. But they both knew this fight was far from over.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Gamera’s Burden\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Gamera and Abigail stood side by side, watching the horizon.\n\n\"I’m not just a weapon,\" Gamera muttered. \"I was made for something more. But sometimes… I wonder if I’m really the hero they made me to be.\"\n\nAbigail turned to him. \"You are. You’ve saved us more times than anyone can count.\"\n\n\"But at what cost?\" Gamera said. \"I’ve watched cities burn, and I’ve had to fight for so long. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just fighting to survive.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9: The Last Threat\n\nJust when they thought the battle was over, a massive roar echoed from the skies. The final space Gyaos had emerged, its body glowing with alien power. It landed in the midst of the city, its eyes glowing redder than ever.\n\n\"Guess the fun’s not over yet,\" Gamera said with a cocky grin, though fear lingered in his voice. He had given everything he had, but this final Gyaos was unlike anything they had faced before.\n\nThe final showdown began, and this time, Gamera fought with everything he had, determined to protect the world he had sworn to defend.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10: The Legacy of the Guardian\n\nWith a final, deafening roar, Gamera unleashed everything he had left. A stream of fire erupted from his mouth, combined with jet flames from his body, creating a swirling vortex of heat and energy. The final Gyaos, overwhelmed by the attack, disintegrated into nothing.\n\nExhausted but triumphant, Gamera landed back on the ground, his massive form towering over the city.\n\n\"You did it,\" Abigail said, her voice full of admiration. \"You really are the guardian.\"\n\nGamera, his cocky grin returning, let out a breath of relief. \"Told ya. I always get the job done.\"\n\n\n\n\nPost-Credit Scene:\n\nOn a distant planet, far beyond the reach of Earth, the survivors of Atlantis watched from their hidden city. The final space Gyaos had been slain, but they had not given up on their plans.\n\nA new minion, a creature known as Guiron, a lizard with a knife for a head, emerged from the shadows, ready to continue their mission to invade Earth. The survivors whispered among themselves.\n\n\"Is he ready?\" one asked.\n\n\"He will be,\" the other responded. \"Gamera may have won this battle, but we will finish what was started.\"\n\nAnd so, the future of humanity remained uncertain, as the remnants of Atlantis plotted their next move."

        "selftext": "Evelyn Moreau had always been drawn to forgotten places. As a child, she wandered through abandoned houses, letting the scent of dust and decay fill her lungs, imagining the ghosts of past lives lingering in the shadows. But nothing fascinated her more than the Marionette Theater.\n\nIt stood like a corpse in the center of town, its once-grand facade sagging under the weight of ivy and rot. The city couldn’t afford to take it down and some wouldn’t dare go near it. \n\nThe Marionette had always been cursed. Before the theater was built, the land was the site of three separate massacres. The first was in 1872, when a traveling carnival passed through town. One night, in the dead of winter, every single performer was found slaughtered, their bodies twisted, their mouths sewn shut. With no explanation and no survivors, the town buried the bodies, burned the remains of the carnival, and tried to forget.\n\nThe second massacre came in 1899, when a wealthy businessman bought the land to build a grand opera house. On the night of its first performance, a darkness took hold, twisting reality into something nightmarish. In a frenzied display of brutality, the lead performer unleashed a torrent of savagery upon the orchestra. With a blood-stained blade, she meticulously slit each musician’s throat, their life-blood splattering across the stage in a crimson haze. As the final notes of agony faded into silence, she hurled herself into the midst of the audience. There, in a state of manic euphoria, she raked her clawed hands across terrified faces, tearing through flesh and sinew. With a visceral, unrelenting ferocity, she plucked out eyes one by one, leaving a gruesome tableau of carnage and despair in her wake. Witnesses said she kept screaming the same phrase over and over:\n\n“Em Pleh”\n\nThe opera house was abandoned, its doors locked and its halls left to fester, the stench of decay seeping into its bones. Years passed, and in 1912, a group of investors swept in, eager to erase its grim history. They razed the crumbling structure to the ground, reducing its haunted remains to dust, and in its place, they erected the Marionette Theater—a fresh start, a new name, a desperate attempt to forget.\n\nThe horrors of the past were dismissed as misfortune, a string of tragic coincidences, nothing more. The town clung to the hope that, buried beneath the rubble, the curse had been laid to rest. But some knew better. Curses don’t die. They wait.\n\nOn October 31, 1935, the theater held what would be its final performance. The show was nearly sold out, the audience packed with socialites, artists, and dignitaries. But among them sat a man no one recognized.\n\nHis name was Edwin Parrish.\n\nParrish had been born deformed, his face a grotesque mask of twisted flesh and misplaced features. His left eye bulged unnaturally from its socket, bloodshot and watery, while the right one was sunken deep into the cavernous folds of his misshapen skull. His nose was a melted ruin, collapsed like wax left too long in the sun, and his lips were gnarled and uneven, pulled into a permanent sneer that exposed yellowed, jagged teeth. His skin, mottled with patches of raw, reddened flesh and deep pockmarks, stretched unevenly across his skull, as if it barely fit the monstrous bone structure beneath.\n\nPeople recoiled at the mere sight of him, their expressions twisting in revulsion before they even realized it. They called him a monster, a mistake of nature, something that shouldn’t exist. He had spent his life lurking in the shadows, skirting the edges of society, knowing that the moment he stepped into the light, he would be met with gasps, sneers, and whispered curses.\n\nEven the theater, a place known for its love of the grotesque and the macabre, had refused him. Not even as a janitor, not even to sweep the floors after the performances had ended, when no one would have to look at him. But tonight, he had found his way inside. Tonight, he was in the audience.\n\nEdwin dragged a heavy suitcase behind him, its worn leather stretched tight over the arsenal hidden within. Inside, nestled in oily rags, lay instruments of death—cold, metallic, and waiting. A pair of revolvers, their pearl grips deceptively elegant, were fully loaded, eager to spit fire and lead. A sawed-off shotgun, its barrels cruelly shortened, promised devastation at close range. A bolt-action rifle, its scope gleaming like an unblinking eye, was ready to claim targets from the shadows. Loose rounds clattered like restless bones, and tucked beside them, a jagged hunting knife gleamed, its edge thirsty for flesh.\n\nHalfway through the performance, as the music swelled to a haunting crescendo, he rose from his seat with eerie calm. The heavy suitcase at his feet snapped open, and in one swift motion, he drew his first weapon—a gleaming revolver with a barrel like a staring, empty eye.\n\nThe first gunshot shattered the lead actress’s skull, sending a spray of blood across the stage. Panic exploded. The audience screamed, bodies crashing over one another in a desperate attempt to escape, but Parrish didn’t stop. He fired into the crowd, his laughter a guttural, broken thing. He moved methodically, execution-style, placing the barrel of his pistol against screaming mouths, against pleading eyes.\n\nBy the time the police arrived, eighty-three people lay dead. Blood soaked the velvet seats, dripped from the balconies like melted wax. The stage was slick with it, a crimson lake pooling beneath the fallen chandeliers.\n\nThey found Parrish sitting in the middle of it all, humming to himself. When the police raised their guns, he turned the last bullet on himself.\n\nThe Marionette Theater never reopened. The blood was left to dry, blackening like old tar, seeping deep into the stage and the plush red seats where horrified faces once sat. Windows cracked, doors warped, but no one touched it. No one even spoke of it.  The theater stood at the town’s heart, a gaping husk of decay, its shadows deep and patient—waiting for someone foolish enough to step inside.\n\nEvelyn had read every story, every account of the massacre. But no one could tell her what happened after. The surviving witnesses refused to speak of what they saw before they ran. The reports hinted at something more—something worse than Parrish. Something waiting behind the curtain.\n\nA quiet curiosity stirred within Evelyn, a gentle but persistent need to see it with her own eyes—to step closer, to take it in, to understand the stories whispered about it.\n\nShe slipped through the rusted side door one cold October night, the hinges groaning like something waking from a long, uneasy sleep. The air inside pressed against her skin, thick and suffocating, damp with decay and something worse—something sour, metallic, and rotten. A faint, sickly scent of old blood clung to the wooden beams, as if the walls themselves had absorbed the violence that once stained them.\n\nRows of broken velvet seats stretched out before her in eerie silence, their tattered fabric sagging like collapsed bodies. The chandeliers, frozen in time, hung like skeletal remains above her head, their shattered glass glinting in the pale moonlight that seeped through cracks in the boarded-up windows. The hush of the theater was unnatural, a soundless void where even her own breath felt intrusive.\n\nShe swallowed hard and stepped forward, her boots stirring up dust that had settled like a burial shroud. The stage loomed ahead, its warped wooden boards groaning under unseen weight. Shadows clung to the corners like living things, twisting as if they might lurch toward her at any moment. The sight of it sent a shiver through her, but she pressed on.\n\nMoving cautiously, she pushed through a side door leading into the backstage corridors. The walls were peeling, the wallpaper curled and flaking away like dead skin. A long hallway stretched before her, lined with dressing rooms and storage spaces. She pressed her fingers to the first door and nudged it open, revealing a room filled with dust-coated vanity mirrors. The bulbs around their frames had burst long ago, their jagged remnants glittering like broken teeth. A few of the mirrors were still intact, their glass murky, smudged with something too dark to be dust. As she stepped closer, her breath hitched—were those fingerprints?\n\nShivering, she backed away and moved on. Another door, another room. This one smelled worse—damp fabric and mildew. Costumes still hung from rusted racks, their once-vibrant colors faded to lifeless grays and browns. The silence in here was different, heavier, as if something lingered just out of sight. A mannequin stood in the corner, draped in a tattered dress, its featureless face turned toward her. She felt a sudden certainty that, if she turned her back, it would move.\n\nSwallowing her fear, she pressed on, deeper into the ruined theater. She followed a narrow staircase downward, the wooden steps creaking under her weight. The air grew colder, denser, and with each breath, the smell of something old and foul intensified. At the bottom, she found herself in a small, forgotten room—a storage space, perhaps, but the walls felt closer here, the darkness more complete.\n\nA mirror stood against the far wall. It was unlike any she had ever seen. The frame was blackened with age, carved with intricate, twisting patterns that seemed to shift in the dim light. The glass itself was dark—not cracked, not broken, but impossibly deep, as though she were staring into something beyond mere reflection.\n\nThe mirror had been hidden for decades, its gilded frame suffocated beneath layers of dust and time. No one dared lay a hand on it, not the workers who had come to restore the crumbling theater, not even the looters who had stripped the place of anything valuable. It remained untouched, veiled in thick,l as if sealing something in or keeping something out.\n\nA heavy velvet cloth covered part of its surface, but as Evelyn stepped closer, she saw something beneath it—a single bloody handprint, smeared against the glass.\n\nEvelyn knew she should have turned back but curiosity always got the better of her. Evelyns fingers quivered as she reached for the cloth, its fabric coarse and damp beneath her touch. Her breath came in short, uneven gasps, the air thick with the scent of mildew.  The Marionette had been sealed away for a reason and Evelyn was about to learn why. \n\nBeneath the suffocating silence of the abandoned theater, something beckoned to Evelyn—a hushed, insidious murmur that slithered through the darkness, curling around her like unseen fingers, tugging her closer. Evelyns pulse hammered against her ribs as she gripped the fabric. It felt heavier than it should, its weight thick and clinging, as if unseen hands on the other side were gripping it, pulling back, resisting her touch with something cold and unwilling to be disturbed. With a deep breath, she yanked it down.\n\nThree Evelyns stood within the mirror—each a perfect copy at first glance, but the longer she stared, the more their flaws unraveled. Their skin seemed stretched too tightly over their bones in some places, while in others, it sagged as if the flesh beneath had begun to slip. Their eyes were just a little too wide, too dark, reflecting nothing, absorbing everything. It was her face, her body—yet distorted as if something else had draped itself in her skin, struggling to wear it correctly.\n\nThe Evelyn on the left wrenched her mouth into a grotesque grin, her lips stretching unnaturally wide, skin pulling tight until it threatened to split. Her fingers twitched at her sides before slowly creeping up to her face, digging into her cheeks, forcing the smile wider—too wide, too strained, as if she were molding herself into something happy, something she wasn’t meant to be. Her hollow eyes remained lifeless, a contradiction to the manic joy carved into her face.\n\nThe Evelyn on the right clutched her head, fingers curling into her scalp with unnatural force. Her nails dug in, deeper and deeper, until the skin split beneath them, dark rivulets trickling down her temples. With a slow, dreadful pull, she began peeling her own hair away in thick, bloody clumps, the strands clinging to her trembling fingers like torn sinew. Her head twitched violently to the side, then again, as though something inside her was trying to shake loose. Her shoulders shuddered, her chest rising and falling in ragged, soundless sobs, but her empty, glassy eyes never lifted—staring downward, locked onto the growing mess in her hands as if she couldn’t stop. As if she didn’t want to.\n\nAnd in the center, the third Evelyn stood deathly still. Her hands remained delicately clasped in front of her, her posture unnervingly perfect, her head tilted just slightly, as if listening to something no one else could hear. Unlike the others, she didn’t twist or writhe, didn’t pull at her own flesh—she simply watched.\n\nHer eyes, black and depthless, held no emotion, no recognition. It was as if she wasn’t just looking at Evelyn, but through her, peeling her apart layer by layer with a gaze that felt intrusive, dissecting. A slow, eerie smile crept onto her lips, too controlled, too knowing, like she had already decided how this would end.\n\n“You shouldn’t have looked,” the central figure whispered.\n\nEvelyn’s stomach twisted. The basement room, with its peeling wallpaper and the scent of old powder and rot, felt smaller, suffocating.\n\nEvelyn’s foot slid backward, her heel barely brushing the dusty floor before a cold, invisible force clamped around her, rooting her in place. A chill slithered up her spine, her breath catching in her throat as the air around her thickened, pressing in like unseen hands. The moment stretched, a dreadful realization settling in—she had moved too late.\n\nThe glass rippled. Not like water, but like something thick and viscous, warping as if the surface of the mirror itself was straining to hold something in. Then, with a sickening crack, fractures spiderwebbed across the reflection, splintering the perfect copies of herself into a thousand jagged shards.\n\nThe Evelyn on the left moved first, her grotesque grin stretching too far, her lips splitting open at the corners, peeling like overripe fruit. Her fingers slapped against the glass, nails splintering as she clawed her way forward, dragging herself through the fractures, the sound a sickening mix of wet slaps and dry, brittle snaps.\n\nThe Evelyn on the right followed, her ruined scalp tearing further as she slammed her forehead into the mirror, again and again, forcing herself through, the wet, sticky sound of flesh separating filling the air.\n\nThe center Evelyn didn’t rush. She placed her hands flat against the cracked surface of the mirror, her fingers splayed wide, pressing deep into the glass as if feeling for a pulse beneath it. The fractures trembled around her touch, humming with something unseen. Slowly, her head tilted—not in curiosity, but in cold, mechanical calculation, like something dissecting its prey before making the first cut.\n\nThe mirror released her with a sound that made Evelyn’s stomach lurch—a grotesque, wet suction, as if something thick and pulpy had been sloughed off raw meat. Her body slipped free, her skin glistening with something damp, as though she had been resting inside the glass like a womb, waiting to be born. Her feet touched the floor noiselessly, unnaturally light, her spine too straight, her movements too smooth, too practiced.\n\nHer black, depthless eyes locked onto Evelyn’s with a focus that felt surgical, peering into her as if peeling her apart layer by layer. Her lips parted just slightly, not enough for speech, just enough to suggest she could if she wanted to. The corners of her mouth twitched, an imitation of a smile that never quite formed, as though she was saving it for later.\n\nBehind her, the others dragged themselves upright, their movements twitchy, their joints jerking like broken marionettes trying to relearn how to stand.\n\nEvelyn stumbled back, but there was nowhere to run. The air thickened around her, pressing down like unseen hands, squeezing her breath from her lungs. The mirror had let them out. And they were coming for her.\n\nThe Evelyn on the left lunged first, her grotesque grin stretched impossibly wide, her split lips dripping with something dark and glistening. Her hands shot out, fingers clawing deep into Evelyn’s cheeks, nails puncturing soft flesh. A sharp, searing pain erupted as she pulled, forcing Evelyn’s mouth into the same unnatural, hideous grin. Skin tore. Blood welled. The muscles in her face screamed in protest, but Left Evelyn only laughed, shaking with silent, convulsing mirth as she twisted Evelyn’s features into something raw and broken.\n\nEvelyn tried to fight, her fingers scrambling to pry the hands away, but the weeping Evelyn on the right was already upon her. The one that clawed at her own scalp, tearing herself apart in slow, methodical agony. And now she turned that suffering outward. Her hands shot forward, still slick with blood from her self-inflicted wounds, and burrowed into Evelyn’s hair. She twisted. Pulled. A sharp, sickening snap filled the room as Evelyn’s head jerked violently to the side. Pain flared hot and blinding down her neck. Her vision blurred, black spots blooming at the edges. But the worst was yet to come.\n\nRight Evelyn’s fingers dug deeper, nails scraping against her skull, yanking at the roots until the skin began to tear. The sensation was unbearable—hot, wet, torturous . With a slow, dreadful rip, clumps of hair and flesh came away, strands hanging from the weeping one’s fingers like blood-soaked threads. The wet, slapping sound of scalp separating sent bile surging up Evelyn’s throat. Her knees buckled, but they wouldn’t let her fall.\n\nThe center Evelyn stepped forward, her movements eerily smooth, untouched by the convulsing silent laughter of the grinning one or the desperate, jerking agony of the weeping one. Her hands remained clasped, head tilting just slightly, as if listening to something beyond the room, beyond the moment. \n\nThe other two held Evelyn still, her body twitching, breath coming in shallow, uneven gasps. Blood streamed down her face where her lips had been torn too wide, where her scalp had been peeled back in weeping, ragged strips. But the center Evelyn only smiled—small, knowing, as though everything had been leading to this.\n\nThe center Evelyn tilted her head, the motion too smooth, too controlled. Then, gently, she reached up and traced a single finger along Evelyn’s cheek, just beneath the ruin of her right eye. A mockery of tenderness. For a moment, her touch lingered, a cruel imitation of reassurance. Without warning, she pushed.\n\nEvelyn’s body seized as pain exploded through her skull. Her eye bulged under the pressure, the soft, delicate flesh distorting, stretching against her touch. Then—pop.\n\nThe orb collapsed in on itself with a sickening squelch, viscous fluid gushing down Evelyn’s cheek in thick, glistening streams. The pain was blinding, a deep, raw ache that sent fresh spasms through her limbs. But the center Evelyn wasn’t finished.\n\nHer fingers wriggled into the open socket, the soft, wet tissue parting around them like clay. Evelyn’s body bucked violently, but the other two held her firm, their nails digging deep into her arms, keeping her open. The center Evelyn’s wrist disappeared into the socket, then her forearm, slipping in with a slick, grotesque ease. Her shoulders folded inward, her neck snapping forward at an unnatural angle, forcing herself deeper.\n\nThe pressure inside Evelyn’s skull mounted, unbearable, as something moved behind her eye, burrowing. Her jaw locked. Blood flooded the back of her throat, thick and metallic, choking her, suffocating her. And still, the center Evelyn crawled forward.\n\nHer other arm disappeared next, followed by her shoulders, her ribcage collapsing inward, vertebrae cracking like snapping twigs. Her body contorted, folding itself smaller and smaller, slipping through the raw, ruptured cavity where Evelyn’s eye had been. Wet, slithering sounds filled the room as her hips pressed against the edge of the socket, her legs kicking once—twice—before vanishing inside.\n\nEvelyn’s body spasmed, wracked with violent tremors that sent her limbs jerking in unnatural, disjointed motions. Her throat strained, mouth yawning open in a soundless scream, lips trembling, choking on breath she couldn’t catch. Her fingers scrabbled wildly—grasping at the empty air, at her own skin, at anything that might ground her, anything that might stop what was happening.\n\nDeep inside her skull, a presence stirred. A slow, sinuous coil of pressure, slithering deeper, pressing outward. The soft, vulnerable walls of her brain compressed against her skull, pulsing under the unbearable force. A grotesque bulge formed at her temple, skin stretching, straining, ready to split.\n\nEvelyn returned home that night. The house was dark, bathed in the moon’s pale glow, a silent mausoleum waiting to be disturbed. The air was thick with the scent of damp wood and something faintly metallic, something that curled at the back of the throat—familiar, but not yet recognized.\nEvelyn stepped inside, her movements fluid, too smooth, too deliberate. Her fingers glided along the banister, nails tracing delicate patterns in the dust. The house groaned under her weight, but she did not falter. There was work to be done.\n\nHer father was the first. He lay sprawled on the couch, snoring softly, oblivious. A half-empty glass of whiskey rested on the side table, the amber liquid catching the dim light in trembling ripples. Evelyn moved with the silence of a shadow, her gaze fixed on his slack-jawed face. She reached for the fireplace poker, its iron tip blackened with soot. Her grip tightened, knuckles paling, but there was no hesitation, no pause for consideration. With a single, forceful thrust, she drove the iron deep into his open mouth, splitting teeth, shattering bone. The gurgling sound that followed was wet, raw, a grotesque symphony of shock and agony. His eyes shot open, wide with pain and betrayal, but she pressed harder, deeper, until the tip of the poker erupted through the back of his skull, glistening and wet. His body twitched once, then fell still.\n\nHer mother was next. The bedroom door creaked as Evelyn pushed it open. Her mother stirred beneath the blankets, murmuring something unintelligible, lost in the haze of sleep. Evelyn approached, her movements eerily measured, her hands steady as she reached for the knitting needles resting on the bedside table. One plunged into the left eye, the other into the right. Her mother’s body jerked violently, her hands flailing, grasping at the air, at the blankets, at Evelyn. Her screams were muffled, choked by the thick blood welling in her throat. Evelyn twisted the needles, the fragile tissue tearing, the sockets filling with dark, viscous fluid. A final, desperate gurgle escaped her mother’s lips before her body went limp, her fingers still twitching, grasping at nothing.\n\nHer little brother, Daniel, was last. He was small, delicate, barely twelve, curled in his bed, oblivious to the carnage unfolding around him. Evelyn lingered in the doorway, watching him for a long moment, tilting her head as if savoring the sight. There was a flicker of something in her expression—not hesitation, not regret, but something deeper, something hungrier.\n\nShe climbed onto the bed with the grace of something inhuman, her weight barely shifting the mattress. Daniel’s breathing was steady, rhythmic, unbroken. Evelyn reached for the pillow, her fingers curling around the fabric, feeling the warmth of his breath against it.\nWith one swift motion, she pressed it down.\nHis body jolted awake, thrashing beneath her. Tiny hands clawed at the fabric, at her arms, at anything that might save him. But she was stronger. She was patient. His movements slowed, spasms turning to weak twitches, twitches to nothing. When she finally lifted the pillow, his face was a ghastly shade of blue, his lips parted in a silent, unfinished scream.\nThe house was silent now.\n\nEvelyn stood amidst the carnage, her head tilting slightly, as if listening for something—some faint echo of satisfaction, some whisper of completion. The blood had begun to seep into the carpet, dark and glistening, spreading like ink. But it was not enough.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the bathroom mirror. It loomed before her, its surface cracked, the fractures splintering her reflection into a dozen warped versions of herself. Some grinned too wide, others wept with silent, bloodied eyes. But the one in the center simply watched, black eyes glinting with something knowing, something patient.\n\nEvelyn stepped forward, her breath steady, her expression serene. She reached for a straight razor, which was found in a bathroom drawer. The blade glinting under the dim light. Her grip was firm, practiced.\n\nWith deliberate precision, she placed the razor at the base of her throat.\n\nShe did not hesitate. The blade glided upward, a slow, deep incision running from collarbone to chin. The skin peeled away in delicate ribbons, blood pooling in her open mouth, spilling over her lips like dark wine. Her fingers trembled, but not from pain. There was no pain. There was only the unraveling.\nShe pressed deeper, splitting flesh from muscle, muscle from bone. Her breath came in wet, gurgling gasps as her hands continued their work, carving, sculpting, peeling. The mirror before her reflected the grotesque masterpiece she was becoming—flesh peeled back, raw and exposed, a wretched thing that had no place in the world. Her head tilted back, mouth parting in something that was almost a laugh, almost a scream. The light in her eyes flickered, dimmed, then went out entirely.\n"

        "selftext": "\n\nI never understood the term Phantom Limb before now.\n\n\n\nI'm no soldier. I didn't lose my arm in a battle or saving someone or doing anything heroic or useful. I lost it due to a series of unlucky events. I was hiking in the woods with some friends, doing some very light rock climbing, and when I slipped, I sliced my arm before the rope caught me. I was more relieved when my legs didn't get broken than I was worried about my arm, so I slapped a bandana on it and kept going. We camped the weekend on the ground, but I put ointment on it and tried to keep it clean. A friend of mine told me Sunday as we piled into our cars that I should keep an eye on the wound.\n\n\n\n\"Those red marks look bad, and there's no telling what you could have picked up out here.\"\n\n\n\nI told him I'd be careful and when I got home I took some Tylenol and put a bandaid on it. I was feeling pretty tired, which was understandable since I had been hiking all weekend. I took myself to bed, turning the air up a little because I was kinda feeling hot, and figured it would be back to business as usual tomorrow.\n\n\n\nInstead, I woke up in the middle of the night with a pounding headache and a high fever.\n\nI took more Tylenol but I just couldn't get back to sleep. I was sweating and headachey, and finally, I got up and went to watch TV. I called out of work when six o'clock rolled around and I only felt worse. I could tell something was wrong, but I thought maybe I had just picked up a cold or something. It wasn't until I went to wipe the sweat off my forehead that I saw the angry red lines running up my arm. They were worse than they had been the day before, and I got shakily to my feet as I stumbled into the bathroom.\n\n\n\nI ran myself a bath and scrubbed at the arm, but the cut was looking worse than ever. It was angry and infected, the red lines running toward my shoulder, and after drying off I decided it might be best to head to head to the ER. I wasn't sure what was wrong, I'm certainly no Doctor, but I knew that what I had wasn't normal.\n\n\n\nI sat in the ER for about four hours only to find out that the cut on my arm was infected.\n\n\n\n\"We want to keep you for a few days and run some tests,\" the Doctor said, \"We are concerned about fever and the apparent onset of symptoms.\"  \n\n\n\nTwo days later I got more bad news. My time in the hospital had been far from beneficial. Whatever I had picked up in the woods had been supplemented by a nasty case of MRSA. While I had laid in bed, eating hospital food, and running my insurance up, I had been exposed to a pretty nasty strain and it had my arm redder and sorer than ever.\n\n\n\nBy Friday they were saying it wasn't affected by antibiotics.\n\n\n\nBy Monday they were talking about amputation.\n\n\n\n\"It's just spreading too quickly, sir. If we don't remove it, you could be looking at a nasty blood infection pretty soon, and we want to get it before we lose the shoulder too.\"\n\n\n\nThe hospital had offered to cover the surgery, probably because my insurance was leaning on them for something I had picked up at the hospital, and I seemed to be out of options. As little as I wanted to learn to live with one arm I didn't really see any way around it. I agreed and by Wednesday I woke up short an arm. They had pushed it ahead, afraid my condition might get worse, and as I looked down at the place where my healthy arm had been about a week ago I wasn't really sure how to feel about it. They had me on all kinds of things, and, at first, I thought that was why I was having the dreams.\n\n\n\nI woke up Thursday night with the strangest feeling in my missing arm I had ever felt. It was like I could feel everything, every finger flex, every follicle of hair, the cold feeling of tile under my fingers, and even the pressure on the missing elbow. It was so weird, like when your leg falls asleep, but...I don't know. I don't really have a way to describe it. It was like the arm was there but it wasn't there.\n\n\n\nThat in of itself would have been weird enough, but as I lay there in my darkened hospital room, I could hear something coming up the hall outside my room. It was a scampering sound, like a rat or a small dog. It wasn't a clicking, like claws, but a thumping like something with little feet coming up the hall.\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nI just lay there, eyes on the open doorway, as my breathing sped up. What was that sound? It had to be a nurse's cart or some kind of equipment, but I couldn't think of what could be making that noise. All I could equate it to was, again, the feet of a small animal.\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nWhy would a small animal be in the hospital?\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nIt couldn't be that. One of the nurses would have seen it and put it out. I looked at the clock and saw that it was past midnight. Who could be walking a dog up the corridor this late at...\n\n\n\nIt came into the doorway and, suddenly, I couldn't breathe.           \n\n\n\nIt was my arm, my hand, all of it, and it was standing there in the door, its shadow trailing into the room.\n\n\n\nIt was perched up on its fingers like Thing from the Addams Family, the dark hairs on my arm looking curly in the low light. It didn't have eyes, but it felt like it was watching me, asking me why I had removed it from my body. The wound was gone, the red veins were gone too, and as I found my breath I started to scream. I was confused and unsure of what was happening, and as the nurses came running, I tried to explain to them what was happening. I told them what I had seen, even pointed at the doorway where it had been, but she just smiled and patted my shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"It's the meds, dear. They make people see all kinds of weird things. I can assure you that if there was a detached human arm wandering around someone would have seen it.\"\n\n\n\nI looked back at the doorway, but it was gone. I suppose it would have had to be or she would have seen it. I laughed, thinking I was just having nightmares, and told her I was sorry for scaring them. She assured me it was okay and headed back to the nurse's station, leaving me to snuggle down under my blankets and try to get back to sleep.\n\n\n\nI was just working back down to it when I heard the drumming of fingers on my nightstand.\n\nI had pulled the covers over my head, but through the thin hospital covering I could see a shadow of something sitting on the standing tray beside my bed. It was drumming impatiently, its non-eyes boring into me as I peeked, and I wondered where it had been hiding while the nurse was there.\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump.*\n\n\n\nI could hear each individual finger as it bounced off the wood, hear the crackling of knuckles, and the creaking of bones. It was seeing me as I was seeing it and it seemed angry. What did it want? Did it mean to hurt me? Even as I wondered, I could still feel those there\/not-there feelings in my missing hand. It's weird to feel an arm and a hand as there and not there, to feel the fingers drumming and then see those fingers drumming across from you. It almost made me feel dizzy, like seeing the magic picture in one of those books.\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nI hunkered under my blanket, that old bastion of protection from the monsters, and wondered how long I would have to hide here. Was someone going to come in and see the hand as it drummed here? Could they see it? Surely it couldn't be real. I was imagining things, I was having an adverse reaction to the medication or something. I would wake up and discover that this was all a dream. I would wake up and find out this had ALL been a dream and I was still camping.\n\n\n\nI waited to wake up or to have a nurse come in, but the longer the drumming of those phantom fingers went on, the less sure I was that it was a dream. What if I had angered the arm by having it removed? What if this was just my life now? My head was pounding and I felt like my vision might be blurry. I wasn't well, this couldn't be real, but the longer I lay here trying to convince myself of that, the louder the drumming became.\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nI was getting frustrated, my teeth grinding together as the drumming of those fingers grated at me. I couldn't take it much longer. It was just a hand. I still had one of them and I wasn't going to let it torment me for no reason. I threw the covers back, waiting for it to just vanish once I was giving it my full attention, but it remained substantial.\n\n\n\nIt was a slightly tanned arm, covered in coarse black hair, and glaring at me with its lack of eyes.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" I growled, \"What do you want? Why are you,\"\n\n\n\nOur staring contest was cut short, however, as the lights came up suddenly and I heard someone come in through the front door.\n\n\n\n\"Good morning. How are we feeling this morning?\"\n\n\n\nI turned and saw my doctor coming in, and I realized it was no longer gloomy in the hallway. The sun was coming out now, a pink line against the window, and when I glanced back at the nightstand, the hand was gone.\n\n\n\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked, putting a hand to my forehead, \"You do feel warm. Are you feeling dizzy at all?\"\n\n\n\nShe looked into my eyes, but before I could answer there was a sound like fingertips on glass.\n\n\n\nThump thump thump thump thump\n\n\n\nI looked up and there it was. It was behind the glass, standing on the very edge of the window sill with nothing below it but pavement. The wind was rustling those arm hairs, but it was the lack of eyes that kept boring a hole into me that drove me over the edge. The doctor jumped when I started screaming, pointing at the window as she called people in to restrain me. I was flailing, pointing out the window, and trying to articulate what I was seeing, but they didn't care. The orderlies had my remaining hand in restraints pretty quickly, and they were administering something into my IV to help with my fever.\n\n\n\n\"You're too hot,\" the Doctor was saying, trying to calm me down, \"We have to get your fever down before it does you harm. Just relax, nothing is going to hurt you. This is a safe place.\"\n\n\n\nI wanted to believe her, but I was just waiting to feel the fingers of that disembodied hand wrap around my neck.\n\n\n\nThe next few days are kind of a blur.\n\n\n\nI would wake up to find the hand on the foot of my bed.\n\n\n\nI would wake up to find it on my bedside table.\n\n\n\nI would wake up to find it gone but then suddenly there it would be right beside me.\n\n\n\nWhatever they had me on made me very groggy and it was almost like being under a sleep paralysis demon. I could watch it until I passed back out again, the way the fingers trembled and knuckles bunched. I could see the look in the area of the forearm that seemed like eyes, and see the desire to throttle me. Those moments made me anxious but it felt like living in a dream. I didn't dream of waking up and finding I had two arms again. I dreamed of waking up and discovering that I wasn't being haunted by the arm I had left behind, one-armed or not.\n\n\n\nThen, I woke up and found I wasn't alone. Someone was sitting with me, reading a book out loud, and when I started coughing they looked up in surprise. I reached for the water pitcher but as my stump came out I remembered I was down to one hand all over again. I let it fall back down and then went to reach with the other hand, the only hand, but he beat me to it. He had been slow in getting up, but he had two working hands and he soon had the cup to my lips so I could have a long, delicious sip of tepid water.\n\n\n\n\"Easy, buddy. You're okay. I told them that reading would help. People like hearing a friendly voice.\"\n\n\n\nI coughed again, looking around frantically as I remembered that I was being stalked.\n\n\n\n\"What's up?\" said the man, a youngish guy who looked to be about twenty-five, \"You looking for your family? I don't think anyone's come to see you since you got here. Oops, sorry, I probably shouldn't have said that. That's usually why I sit with people, because they need a friendly voice.\"\n\n\n\nI was still looking around, but when I didn't see the hand, I let out a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" I said, my voice rusty, \"No, it's okay.\"\n\n\n\nHe smiled, \"Well, that's good at least. You have a bad dream or something?\"\n\n\n\nI lay back against my pillows, the board on the wall telling me that I had been in and out for almost three weeks. Jesus! I had picked up a hell of an infection somewhere. It didn't matter though. I was just glad to have woken up to something besides the ever-present hand.\n\n\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I,\"\n\n\n\n*Thump thump thump thump thump*\n\n\n\nMy jaw trembled.\n\n\n\nIt couldn't be.\n\n\n\nI turned my head slowly, expecting to hear the tendons creak, and there it was. It was sitting on the radiator, drumming its fingers and glaring at me with its nonexistent eyes. I wanted to cry, I wanted to scream, but when the man turned my head to look at him, I felt little beyond surprise.\n\n\n\n\"I find it's better to just ignore them. I'm guessing it's the arm, right? Is it watching you?\"\n\n\n\nI nodded before I could stop myself, \"Ye...yeah, how did you know?\"\n\n\n\nHe smiled, thumping his leg with the book he had been reading, \"Got one of my own. Lost it in Iraq. I had a grenade hit him in the foot and, luckily, I got about two steps away before it went off. Lost the foot and most of the knee, but I got to keep my eyes and I lived.\"\n\n\n\nI was shocked, \"Wait, you can see it too?\"\n\n\n\nHe made a weird noise and then shook his head, \"Not yours, but I can see mine in the corner over there. It's weird how they seem to stare without eyes, isn't it? Like, how do they manage that I wonder.\"\n\n\n\nI was overjoyed. This guy could see them too. Could all people who had lost body parts see them like this? How long did it last? I remembered what he had said, and wondered if it ever ended.\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he assured me, taking his seat again, \"You just get used to it after a while. They never go away, at least, none of the guys in my support group have had there's go away, but you get used to them. I'll get you one of the cards if you like. It's nice to have people who know what you're going through.\"\n\n\n\n\"But why is it still here?\" I almost begged, desperate for answers.\n\n\n\n“No one really knows. They've been part of us all our lives, so I guess it makes sense that they want to stay close. Vets and amputees talk about phantom limb syndrome, but I think it's more than just tingles. When that foot jumps, I feel it jump. I imagine it's the same for you, too. They are a part of us, and they always will be, I guess.”\n\n\n\nI laid back as he started reading again, letting this knowledge wash over me as the words of The Hobbit wafted over me. On the radiator, the hand still drummed its fingers and scowled with its lack of eyes. As I lay there ignoring it, I supposed I might as well take his advice to heart.\n\n\n\nI supposed I would always be haunted now, haunted by this phantom limb. \n\n"

        "selftext": "# The Rizzler of Ohio Street\n\nI'm what you would call a Sigma male, no cap, just facts. I got my style on lock, I am buttery with the ladies, my boys want to be me, and my vibes always pass the check. Hell, I was so sigma, that my Dad never bothered coming back with milk. He knew he couldn't stand beside an alpha male like me, so why bother? It's cool, though, cause my mom is the best and the bands I make from my zeencast on the manosphere keeps us cumf AF. I mean, she's got a OF, but she only sells feet picks, so its classy.\n\nSo when this rando, this rizzless chud, dms me on snap and tells me that my vibes are stale, but he can fix me, I scoff into my stanley. This beta wants to Charleston with a Sigma like me, frfr? Na, I'd win. This baldhead says to meet him on Ohio Blvrd at midnight and that he can take my game to the next level. He's capping, frfr, but, could he be dead ass? A true Sigma is always evolving, peeking game and studying vibes, so I owed it to myself to check his vibes in person. His profile pic looked weak, some chub who prolly doesn't even edge, and I wasn't sweaten him.\n\nI had time, so I got about my morning routine of mewing, gooning, and generally posting my workout to Insta. As an influencer, it's important for people to know when I am maxing, they need that kind of positivity in their lives if they're ever gonna be on my level. I had a Feastable for lunch, gotta support the OG's, and put a Feastable bar in my pocket for later. I decided to go live and play a modest eight hours of Roblox, for the fans, but when I looked down I realized I had almost missed my yap sesh with this Ohio Rizzler. Ha, like he could be the frfr Ohio Rizzler, I thought, as I goon maxed before getting an Uber to the deets he’d sent me.\n\nSo i caught an Uber to Ohio Avenue, and the driver was some boomer who yapped about how he'd been in Korea or sumshit. Bozo thinks I don't know you can't go to Korea cause that weird haircut dude says so, like I'm a buster. Psh, old heads.\n\n\"You should be careful,\" he said, testing my vibes, \"I dropped a kid about your age off here last week. They found him in an alley nearby and the scene wasn't pretty.\"\n\n\"Yap yap yap, boomer,\" I said, only tipping 12% before heading to my meeting of the vibes. \n\nI looked fresh. I had my Logan Paul merch on, sweats and hoodie, and my crocs were already in sport mode in case this Rizzler was a Creapler. I had my Mr. Beast brand mace too, thanks Jimmy, and all that mewing had given me an even Chaddier chin line than usual. This guy was in for a shock. I don't think he had peeped my Insta and realized I go to the gym three times a week and totally work out between photo seshes. I checked my phone, it was eleven fifty nine, and I was starting to think this guy wouldn't show when I peeped something from up the way.\n\nHe was chuegy AF, no cap. Hommie low key looked like the Riddler, but after a glowup. His threads were giving stale vibes but there was just something about him that was a mood. Round hat, Diddy coat and tapered pants, straight up fiddledeedees on his grippers, buckles and all, and his cane was pretty cringe with that skull on it. He was coming towards me like he was looking for hands, but I checked my vibe and found my chill. If bro wanted me shook, he was gonna discover I was build different, periodt.\n\n\"You SigmaChad42069?\" he says, his voice giving big creep energy.\n\n\"Facts, you the, so called, Rizzler of Ohio Street?\"\n\nHe swooped his hands out as if to say obvi, \"What do your eyes tell you, son?\"\n\n\"Looks like I crept out my goon cave to share vibes with some buster, cuz. You looks like a straight L, some rizzless chud without a white toe to be seen on your bitch.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'd have to ask your mother about her toes,\" he said, crossing his arms and grinning.\n\n\"On God, that's almost hands, brah!\"\n\n\"Step then and see what happens,\"\n\nIght, say less, I thought. I prepared to rock his shit with an absolutely YEET inducing right hook, but as I checked yes on Gorilla mode I found the Rizzler had already stepped out. Gone quicker than my Dad on a milk run, the Rizzler was nowhere to be peeped, but when that cane came down hard behind me, I turned to see him standing where I had stood.\n\n\"Fake,\" I breathed, \"No fact check needed. I should have ate.\"\n\n\"Looks like you busted instead,\" The Rizzler of Ohio Street said, eying me like a snack, \"Speaking of bustin', I think it's my turn to do some clappin.\"\n\n\"Na,\" I said, \"Unsubscribe,\" and I dashed. His vibes were cooked, I could feel his aura from here, and unless I wanted to get Diddied, I needed to dip hard. the buildings zoomed past mad fast while I dipped, tryna bounce from the weirdos as I bolted. Couldn’t even peep him trailing, those kicks should’ve been loud AF, but when I looked back, he was just vibing mad smooth, staying close.\n\n\"Ain’t no way, how you pulling this vibe?\" I yapped, mad shook! \n\n\"I suppose you would say I'm \"built different\".\" The Rizzler said.\n\nI was just sprinting, no cap, then a whip rolled up to the light. I opted hop in, but the closer I got, I peeped it wasn’t just any ride. It was the same cab I rolled in with. The old dude had said this creep was sus, maybe he could vibe check me. I banged on the door like, 'I need help!' but as the Rizzlers' hand hit my shoulder, I legit knew I was donezo.\n\n\"End of the line, Sigma. Looks like it's time to get clapped for,\" but the old guy had other machinations.\n\nHe cranked the window down, flexin' on the Rizzler while yellin' for him to bounce. Rizzler backed off, dodging that smoke, and I seized the moment to push the chuegy guy off me. He tripped back, and I hopped in the whip as we skrrt out. The old dude asked if I was lit, and I said I was vibing before clocking who was just chillin' in the road in front of us.\n\nThe Rizzler was vibing there, arms out like he was gonna snag the whip, but the old dude just gassed it and rolled right over him. \n\nBuilt different or nah, the Rizzler got bodied by the cab and we dipped while I was begging him to take me home, fr.\n\nI peeked at the back window, but dude wasn’t chilling in the street. Didn’t vibe with that, but I dipped so that was fire. The old head said to ring the cops, but nah, too much drama. We made it out, that was the move, so I said I just wanted to chill at home. He nodded, dropped me at the crib, telling me to be lowkey next time. I said bet, then hit the sack. What a wild night, fr fr!\n\nNext morn, I woke up to that brekkie aroma. Mom was MIA when I got back, so I guessed she was out vibing late. I slid to the kitchen, keeping last night lowkey so moms didn't tri\\[. Some dude was at the stove, dripped in my mom's bathrobe, nothing else. I was like, 'Who this?' and he whipped around, giving me a mad scare!\n\nIt was the Rizzler! The Rizzler of Ohio Street!\n\n\"Ayo, how'd you slide into my crib?\" I asked, but Mom slid in and dropped the tea about that time.\n\n\"There you are, Sigma. I'm so glad you met Mr. Ohio. We met last night and, well, one thing led to another, and he came home with me. He's just so charming, Sigma, I was putty in his hands.\"\n\n\"I hear that all the time,\" The Rizzler yapped, smooching her neck while I peeped her aura shift. \"but I think if you would have me, I could finally be a one-woman man.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, peeping the time, \"I've got to go. I'll see you boys tonight. Love you.\"\n\nShe dipped out rockin’ her open toe kicks for work, and I was lowkey shook by what I peeped fr fr.\n\nHer toes were slayin’ fresh, snow white vibes.\n\nHe dropped a plate in front of me, like bacon and eggs on fleek, toast vibin', had to say it hit different.\n\nThey tied the knot last week, big vibes and all, and now the Rizzler from Ohio is my new Stepfather, no cap!\n\nSo I guess what I'm yapping, chat, is Am I Cooked?\n\nThe Rizzler of Ohio Street\n\nI'm what you would call a Sigma male, no cap, just facts. I got my style on lock, I am buttery with the ladies, my boys want to be me, and my vibes always pass the check. Hell, I was so sigma, that my Dad never bothered coming back with milk. He knew he couldn't stand beside an alpha male like me, so why bother? It's cool, though, cause my mom is the best and the bands I make from my zeencast on the manosphere keeps us cumf AF. I mean, she's got a OF, but she only sells feet picks, so its classy.\n\nSo when this rando, this rizzless chud, dms me on snap and tells me that my vibes are stale, but he can fix me, I scoff into my stanley. This beta wants to Charleston with a Sigma like me, frfr? Na, I'd win. This baldhead says to meet him on Ohio Blvrd at midnight and that he can take my game to the next level. He's capping, frfr, but, could he be dead ass? A true Sigma is always evolving, peeking game and studying vibes, so I owed it to myself to check his vibes in person. His profile pic looked weak, some chub who prolly doesn't even edge, and I wasn't sweaten him.\n\nI had time, so I got about my morning routine of mewing, gooning, and generally posting my workout to Insta. As an influencer, it's important for people to know when I am maxing, they need that kind of positivity in their lives if they're ever gonna be on my level. I had a Feastable for lunch, gotta support the OG's, and put a Feastable bar in my pocket for later. I decided to go live and play a modest eight hours of Roblox, for the fans, but when I looked down I realized I had almost missed my yap sesh with this Ohio Rizzler. Ha, like he could be the frfr Ohio Rizzler, I thought, as I goon maxed before getting an Uber to the deets he’d sent me.\n\nSo i caught an Uber to Ohio Avenue, and the driver was some boomer who yapped about how he'd been in Korea or sumshit. Bozo thinks I don't know you can't go to Korea cause that weird haircut dude says so, like I'm a buster. Psh, old heads.\n\n\"You should be careful,\" he said, testing my vibes, \"I dropped a kid about your age off here last week. They found him in an alley nearby and the scene wasn't pretty.\"\n\n\"Yap yap yap, boomer,\" I said, only tipping 12% before heading to my meeting of the vibes. \n\nI looked fresh. I had my Logan Paul merch on, sweats and hoodie, and my crocs were already in sport mode in case this Rizzler was a Creapler. I had my Mr. Beast brand mace too, thanks Jimmy, and all that mewing had given me an even Chaddier chin line than usual. This guy was in for a shock. I don't think he had peeped my Insta and realized I go to the gym three times a week and totally work out between photo seshes. I checked my phone, it was eleven fifty nine, and I was starting to think this guy wouldn't show when I peeped something from up the way.\n\nHe was chuegy AF, no cap. Hommie low key looked like the Riddler, but after a glowup. His threads were giving stale vibes but there was just something about him that was a mood. Round hat, Diddy coat and tapered pants, straight up fiddledeedees on his grippers, buckles and all, and his cane was pretty cringe with that skull on it. He was coming towards me like he was looking for hands, but I checked my vibe and found my chill. If bro wanted me shook, he was gonna discover I was build different, periodt.\n\n\"You SigmaChad42069?\" he says, his voice giving big creep energy.\n\n\"Facts, you the, so called, Rizzler of Ohio Street?\"\n\nHe swooped his hands out as if to say obvi, \"What do your eyes tell you, son?\"\n\n\"Looks like I crept out my goon cave to share vibes with some buster, cuz. You looks like a straight L, some rizzless chud without a white toe to be seen on your bitch.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'd have to ask your mother about her toes,\" he said, crossing his arms and grinning.\n\n\"On God, that's almost hands, brah!\"\n\n\"Step then and see what happens,\"\n\nIght, say less, I thought. I prepared to rock his shit with an absolutely YEET inducing right hook, but as I checked yes on Gorilla mode I found the Rizzler had already stepped out. Gone quicker than my Dad on a milk run, the Rizzler was nowhere to be peeped, but when that cane came down hard behind me, I turned to see him standing where I had stood.\n\n\"Fake,\" I breathed, \"No fact check needed.

        "selftext": "Orry\n\t\nThe first sign was the birds. They started falling from the sky at exactly 3:33 p.m., not dead—just… folded wrong. Inside out, almost, with feathers where eyes should be. Nobody screamed. Not at first. People just stood still, necks tilted back, watching the soft rain of malformed sparrows tumble down like ash.\nJames was the only one who didn’t look up. He was busy reading the name carved into his arm. It hadn’t been there yesterday. And it wasn’t his name.\nOrry.\nIt curled along his skin in deep red grooves, healed but angry, like it had been there for years. Each letter shimmered faintly in the sun, like something beneath his skin was trying to blink.\t\n\tAcross the street, a child was pulling teeth from a dandelion. Long human molars, still warm, blooming out of the yellow fluff like seeds. She didn’t seem upset—just bored. Every time she plucked one, a new one grew in its place. A man passed by her and casually tossed a penny into her lap, as if she were doing something normal. Like busking.\n\tJames blinked. His mouth was dry. The buildings were too tall. They leaned in. A bus rolled by, empty but loud, its wheels grinding like they were chewing.\n\t“Hey,” said a voice behind him.\n\tJames turned. The man wore a milkman’s uniform—white, crisp, wrong for the decade—and no eyes. Just stitched lids with mascara leaking from the seams. He held out a small glass bottle filled with something thick and dark.\n\t“It’s your turn,” the milkman said, shaking it. “You can’t keep skipping days.”\n\tJames took it without meaning to. His fingers were trembling. The bottle was warm.\n\tFrom somewhere above them, a church bell rang, slow and wet. It sounded like meat slapping tile. Nobody else heard it.\nJames didn’t remember unscrewing the cap, but the bottle was open. The liquid inside moved like ink in reverse—pulling light into itself instead of reflecting it. It smelled like burnt rosemary and pencil lead.\n\t“Bottoms up,” the milkman said. His stitched eyes twitched.\n\tJames tipped the bottle toward his lips but stopped when the sun blinked.\n\tNot behind a cloud.\n\tThe sun itself blinked. Once. Slowly.\n\tHe dropped the bottle. It didn’t shatter. It breathed. A slow, glassy exhale as it melted into the sidewalk, leaving behind a ring of frost and a single eyelash.\n\tThe milkman was gone.\n\tIn his place stood a payphone with the receiver swinging. It rang once—just once—but the sound came from inside James’s chest. It rattled in his ribs.\n\tHe ran.\n\tDown alleys that stretched too long. Past storefronts that all had the same display: A clock, bleeding from its numbers. The digits oozed down the glass like syrup, congealing into words he couldn’t read.\n\tThe ground was soft. Like bread. It gave slightly underfoot, like the whole city had been baked too long ago to still be fresh.\n\tHe stopped at a mirror nailed to a tree—because of course now there were trees—and looked into it.\n\tThe reflection wasn’t him.\n\tIt was a man with no mouth, wearing James’s clothes, holding a bouquet of snakes. They hissed in harmony, forming one word: Orry.\n\tThe trees began whispering names he almost remembered—lovers he’d never kissed, funerals he hadn’t attended. The ground cracked. The roots beneath pulsed like veins.\n\tJames stumbled backward and fell into a puddle that hadn’t been there before. The water was deep, bottomless. Falling felt like drowning, but wetter. Colder.\nJames landed on a carpet of static. Not a sound—actual static. The floor fuzzed and rippled under his palms like old television snow. He looked up and saw nothing but frames—hanging midair. Empty picture frames, all sizes, all spinning slowly.\n\tInside some of them, there were moments. Little clips. James as a child, sobbing in a field of headless dolls. James older, feeding something that looked like a goat but blinked horizontally. James asleep in a hospital bed, surrounded by people he didn’t recognize, all facing away from him.\n\tIn one frame, he was standing in front of a door. Rusted, pitted, too narrow to be real. It pulsed gently. Like it was breathing.\n\tHe looked away from the frame and the door was in front of him.\n\tIt hadn’t opened. But the key was in his hand. He hadn’t picked it up. It was made of glass, and a single vein ran through it—pulsing.\n\tHe knew what would happen if he opened it.\n\tHe knew what wouldn’t.\n\tA voice—no, his voice—spoke behind him. “This is where you stopped before. Don’t pretend you forgot.”\n\tJames didn’t turn around.\n\tHe put the key in the lock.\nThe door smiled. Literally. Dozens of human teeth lined the edge like bristles. It groaned open.\n\tInside was not a room.\n\tInside was a chair. One single chair in a white void, and Orry was sitting in it.\n\tExcept… Orry was James. Or James was Orry. Or neither. The body wore his skin, but wrong—loose in some places, too tight in others. The face twitched between familiarity and distortion, like it couldn’t decide which version of him to be.\n\t“You're early,” Orry-James said. “Or late. It's always hard to tell when the birds fall too fast.”\n\tJames opened his mouth to speak but instead screamed—not from his throat, but from his hands. His fingers parted, and his palm split open like a mouth, releasing a sound only dogs could understand.\n\tThe lights above them (where had the ceiling come from?) began to flicker Morse code in blood.\n\tOrry stood. “Do you want to wake up now?”\n\tJames nodded.\n\tOrry shook his head. “Then don’t open the door again.”\nJames’s eyes shot open.\n\tHe was in bed. Sheets damp with sweat. Fan whirring. The soft, choking hum of early morning light coming through the blinds. His heart was hammering, but the world was still.\n\tNo malformed birds. No melting bottles. No Orry.\n\tJust… morning.\n\tHe stared at the ceiling, trying to shake the taste of static from his mouth. His alarm clock blinked red in the corner.\n\t3:33 a.m.\n\tAs he sat up, the corner of his blanket fell back—and he saw the name.\n\tFaint. Faded. But there.\n\tOrry. Etched on his forearm. Like old scar tissue that had been waiting to be noticed.\n\tJames stumbled to the bathroom. Splashed water on his face. Didn’t look up at the mirror at first. Didn’t want to.\t\n\tBut he did.\n\tAnd the reflection was fine. Normal. Tired eyes. Dry lips. No bouquet of snakes.\n\tThen the mirror blinked. Just once.\n\tHe didn’t.\n\tThe clock in the hall chimed from nowhere—once, twice, three times. The sound was wet. Like bones breaking under pressure.\n\tHe walked to the kitchen, needing light. Needing coffee. Needing anything real.\n\tOn the counter was a feather.\n\tNot black. Not white. But the color of nothing—an absence. It shimmered like forgetting. It hadn’t been there last night. It shouldn’t have been there.\n\tHe picked it up.\n\tUnderneath it was a note, written in scorched handwriting:\n\t“You were Orry before you woke up.\n\tYou’ll be him again soon.”\n\tBehind him, a door creaked open.\n\tHis bedroom door.\n\tExcept he hadn’t opened it. And from the gap leaked light.\n\tNot yellow. Not white.\n\tStatic.\n"

        "selftext": "When I was in college, I got involved with a paranormal researching group through a friend of mine, we'll call him M. M knew I had a general interest in the occult, something that would flourish as my time in Georgia went on, and had decided that I was a sensitive, someone who could feel spirits. I don't know if I could or not, but he was insistent enough for the both of us so I went along with it. M was, of course, our Occult Expert. At the time, I thought M knew a lot of things and had some kind of otherworldly knowledge about the avenues of Occult workings, but he ultimately turned out to be a good grifter. He curated this mystique about him that was alluring to a certain type of woman and it helped him bounce from bed to bed in the three or four years I knew him.\n\n\n\nWe were joined in our ghost hunting by a woman named Eva, who is still doing ghost hunting in the North Georgia area as far as I knew. She had a lot of equipment for ghost hunting, things she had picked up from previously failed groups, and was our resident tech head. I'm pretty sure she and M were together, though maybe not officially, and we stayed in touch after the group broke up. Our fourth was a guy named Simon who kind of reminded me of Dib from Invader Zim, though I'm not sure he was doing it on purpose. He fancied himself a cryptozoologist and was also a wealth of knowledge when it came to conspiracy theories. He believed everything from alien abduction to the FBI assassinating JFK and you couldn't convince him that any of it was anything but gospel. He was friends with M too and it sort of made M our defacto leader. \n\n\n\nWe rode around in his mom's white minivan, Mystery Inc. style, and helped people who were experiencing strange activity.\n\n\n\nWe did this for about six months before Eva and M began to argue and Simon graduated and moved to Pennsylvania, but we had some times in those six months. Most of it was curiosity work, standing in cemeteries and taking pictures to get spirits orbs, taking recordings to hear sounds, and the usual kind of thing ghost hunters do. A few others stand out, I might tell you about a few of them, but the one I want to talk about it's the case I remember as the Smoke House.\n\n\n\nThe Smoke House was unique because it was one of the few cases we had that made me think what happened might have been our fault. \n\n\n\nThe family that lived there was called The Fosters, Mary, and Kevin (Not their real names, but close enough). They were recommended to us by a professor at the college, a friend of theirs. They had recently noticed a strange smell in the house that no one could explain. They had been to electricians, home inspectors, and contractors, and they had all kinds of inspections and offers and such but no real answers. They had come to the professor, and he had come to us.\n\n\n\n\"Their son died a year ago, and they are afraid his spirit might be haunting the place. I don't know why they have come to this conclusion, but they want someone to take a look who knows what they are doing.\"\n\n\n\nWe pulled up to their house at about six-thirty, just as the sun was getting low. \n\n\n\nM said it would be more mysterious if we arrived at sunset, which might cast us in shadow so they looked more legitimate.\n\n\n\nM always seemed more interested in appearance than actually doing anything.\n\n\n\nThe couple was older, maybe late fifties or early sixties, and they showed us in with smiles and questions about drinks or food.\n\n\n\nSome of us ate, some of us drank, and we all listened to what they had to say.\n\n\n\n\"We've lived here for forty years, bought it when we were newlyweds. Andrew, our son, was born here. Didn't quite make it to the hospital, so the wife had him right here in the kitchen. He lived here until he was nineteen when he decided he wanted to be a firefighter. We were proud, but not very hopeful. Andrew had tried to get into the Army and was refused, tried to get into the Police Academy the year before but couldn't make it, and now it was firefighter school. We figured this would make three, but he excelled at it. He got into shape, he learned the material, and not long after he was a firefighter.\" \n\n\n\nThe woman sobbed a little, looking down into her coffee before her husband continued.\n\n\n\n\"Our son was a firefighter for nearly a decade until he died in a fire trying to save a family from a collapsing building. They brought us his fire coat and his helmet and we brought it home and made a little remembrance wall. It's in my wife's sewing room now, along with a picture of him, and we find it a great comfort. A couple of months after he died, the smell began. It's a smokey smell, I'm sure you've smelled it since you came in. The others have smelled it too, but none of them can find it or make it stop. We've tried to get rid of it through the normal means, so now we attempt to get rid of it through less conventional means. We'll pay you if you can figure out why it's doing this.\"\n\n\n\nSo, we set to work. Eva set up some cameras and microphones, Simon helping her, and M and I set about being Sensitives. M would ask me what I felt and I would tell him what came to mind. He would always nod, eyes closed, and then tell me what it meant like some pocket sage. He always understood what it meant, understood with that maddening way of his, and I accepted it.\n\n\n\nI didn't sense much. Scuffling in the attic that turned out to be squirrels, the hum of a washing machine, a slight creak that could be nothing more than the house settling, but nothing of any substance. It was usually like that, but any little thing always meant something mystical. M could hear phantom voices in the rattling of an old water heater, but we never really questioned him. Questioning in that community was frowned upon. If you called someone out for their bullshit, they were likely to call you out for yours. We were all just trying to see if we could do real magic, hoping it would be us who was the next Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. We all wanted to be special, but we mostly just looked ridiculous.\n\n\n\nAfter about three hours, Eva hadn't gotten any audio or video, and I hadn't felt more than the hum of the washing machine. We were at a loss for the smell, something all of us had admitted to smelling, but, of course, M had the answer. He went to the memorial wall and pointed to it, nodding as he wove his hands before it.\n\n\n\n\"There's a spirit attached to this coat. He's displeased at being deceased before his time, and what you are smelling is his spirit. I will tie a charm to it and put a circle of salt around it so that the spirit might disconnect on its own. Do I have your permission to move it?\"\n\n\n\nThe Fosters said he did and he took it down as he moved it to a spot on the floor. He looked at it and then added the helmet too before encircling the whole thing in salt. He held his hands out once this was done, speaking low before raising his voice and speaking to whatever spirit he believed had attached itself to it.\n\n\n\n\"Spirit, I beseech you to move on. Your life here is no more, you must go to whatever lies beyond. Begone from this house, you are welcome here no more.\"\n\n\n\nThen he spouted some pseudo-Latin at it and forked the sign of the evil eye at it. There was no pillar of fire, no unearthly laughter, and we all just stood there and watched the coat, ignoring the blackened marks on the arms. When he was satisfied, M told them that if the smoke smell came back, they should call us immediately.\n\n\n\n\"If it hasn't come back in three days then the coat and helmet should be fine to hang on the wall again.\"\n\n\n\nThey thanked him, and when he slipped his hand into his pocket I realized they had given him money.\n\n\n\nWhen we climbed into the van and M didn't comment on it, I realized he didn't mean to tell us about it.\n\n\n\nTwo days later, I got a call.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't from The Fosters, it was from the police.\n\n\n\nThey had M down at the station and they wanted the rest of us to come down too.\n\n\n\nApparently, The Fosters were dead and their house had been burned to the ground.\n\n\n\n\"We understand that you and your friends were there the day before. Do you mind if we ask what you were doing at the Foster's house?\"\n\n\n\nI explained what it was our group did, but the officer in charge of my questioning scoffed.\n\n\n\n\"So you didn't do anything? Is that what you're telling us?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sir. I have left nothing in the house and when we got in our van, The Fosters were very much alive.\"\n\n\n\nHe nodded, taking a picture out and putting it on the table, \"Does this look familiar?\"\n\n\n\nIt was a little grainy, but it was clearly the remains of the coat M had circled in salt.\n\n\n\nThe charm was still attached to it and the salt around it was undisturbed.\n\n\n\n\"That's their son's coat, the one who died. My friend, M, put a circle of salt around it and affixed a charm to it because he believed a spirit was attached to it. Neither are flammable and we in no way started that fire.\"\n\n\n\nThey had a few more questions, but they ultimately had to let us go. There was no proof we had done anything but go in and play pretend for about four hours, and they had to turn us loose. We all decided not to talk about it again, but I think we all realized that something had happened there that night. We had made something angry and it had killed that nice old couple because of it. We had not been the cause, not really, but we had, also. If we had let it go, they would probably be alive today, still dealing with a smokey smell and nothing else.\n\n\n\nAfter that, we were a little more careful about how we interacted with spirits.\n\n\n\nActions, after all, have consequences. "

        "selftext": "\n\"Penny for your thoughts, young man?\"\n\nI glanced down at the old man as he sat in the snow, his jeans getting crusty from the ice.\n\nHe held a grubby coin in his threadbare glove and his eyes looked up, imploring me to take it. \n\nHomeless people weren't exactly rare in the city, and I was honestly tired of being asked for change today. I had been asked for change as I went to work that morning several times. I had been asked when I stepped out to have a smoke around ten that morning. I had been asked again as I went to lunch, and twice more as I returned. I had been asked for handouts throughout the day, but this was the first one who had offered to give me anything.\n\nI reached down hesitantly, and when he moved it out of the way, I figured he would make his pitch now.\n\nThe coin would be rare.\n\nThe coin would be special.\n\nHe would want something for it and then I would be asked to give.\n\n\"Your thoughts first, son. An even trade, I'm sure.\"\n\nI drew in a nose full of cold air, thinking about making something up before finally settling on the truth.\n\n\"Okay, you want to know what I was thinking about? I'll tell you. I pass people like you every day, people on the streets with nothing better to do than beg. Why not try to better yourself with all that time you have? Why not drag yourself out of your situation rather than sit and huddle in it? You have the ability to get out of your current quagmire, you choose not to, and that makes me angry.\"\n\nI had expected the old man to get mad, I had expected him to get quiet and take his coin back, but he surprised me when he laughed.\n\n\"Is that what you think? That we're all just lazy bums out on the road with nothing better to do? I imagine you might change your mind if you had to do it yourself.\"\n\nI scoffed, \"Please. Living off the generosity of others? This is a city of thousands. Even if only one percent showed you charity, that's still likely more than I make in a week.\"\nThe old man smiled knowingly, and that should have been my first indication that something was amiss. Even then, I sensed that something didn't feel right here. This wasn't the usual kind of banter one had with a person, even someone like this guy, and it was starting to prickle the hair on the back of my neck. Why had I stopped to talk to this fellow at all? \n\nThis whole thing just felt odd.\n\n\"Wanna make a wager on that?\" the old beggar asked\n\nHe still had the coin out, and when I got a good look at it, I could tell it wasn't what I thought it was.\n\nIt was filthy, but it had the underlying gleam of gold, unevenly milled, and thick on the edge he had showed me.\n\n\"Live for a week as I live, if you can. After seven days, if you're still alive, I'll grant you any wish your heart desires.\"\n\nI shook my head, thinking the old man had to be crazy. What was he, some kind of genie? My mind flashed to the Beauty and the Beast story too, however. Hadn't the fairy come to him on a snowy night and made requests? If I declined his offer, what would the consequences be?\n\nI shook my head, I was a grown man out here weighing fairy stories, what was wrong with me? \n\n\"Sure, old-timer. It's a deal. What do I need to do? Prick my finger? Promise you my firstborn?\"\n\n\"Just take the coin,\" he said, holding it out, \"but make sure you hang on to it. If you go the full week but lose your coin...well, I can't promise it will end well for you.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes, reaching for it without thinking. I wasn't really afraid that it might magic. It was more likely to be coated in something like fentanyl or acid. I had gloves on, and I didn't expect that whatever he had coated it in could soak through my leather wraps. I lifted the coin to my eyes, looking at it in the dim light of the lamp post, and saw that it was bigger than I had thought it would be.\n\nIt was the size of a half dollar, one side picturing a proud king while the other had a grinning skeleton. The words percussum est dela were printed on the front with vivere vel damnari ab eo emblazoned on the back. I knew they were Latin words, but that was all I knew. The coin was old, some ancient edifice of commerce, and as I looked at it in the street lamp, it flashed in my eye with a sudden stab of pain. \n\nThe last thing I heard was the old man laughing and then I fell into darkness for some undeterminable time. \n\nI was awoken not by my alarm, but by the less-than-kind tap of a stick on my foot.\n\n\"Hey, HEY, I've already told you that you can't sleep here. Pack it up before I call the cops.\"\n\nI came groggily awake, aware of being cold and slightly damp before anything else. I put a hand up to my eyes, wondering what had been on that coin the old man had given me, and as my vision came into view, I saw a large man in an apron standing over me with a broom. He held it with the blunt end raised, prepared to swing if I made a sudden move. I put a hand out and told him there was some kind of mistake, but when I raised my hands I saw they were wrapped in the threadbare gloves that had been holding the coin. What's more, my clothes felt scratchy, like bugs had been crawling on me, and as I got up, the man with the broom tensed like he might take a swing.\n\n\"I'm serious. Get out of here before I call the cops.\"\n\nI told him I was going and as I stumbled out of the alley I saw that it was early morning. There was still ice on the ground, steam coming up through the sewer vents, and people were milling up the sidewalk on their way to work or wherever. I must have looked a mess because they walked past me without a second glance. The man with the broom was watching me from the mouth of the alley I had been sleeping in, and made it pretty clear that if I didn't start moving again he was going to make good on his threats to call the police.\n\nAs I made my way down the street, I was already reaching for my cell phone. I'd call an Uber and get back to my apartment. I was unsurprised to find it was missing, as were my wallet and my house keys. No problem, they had no idea which apartment I lived in so the keys wouldn't do them any good. A car was something I never saw the need to own, so I had no vehicle to steal. The old man had gotten away with about eighty dollars from my wallet at the end of the day, and anything he took from my bank account would soon be returned. \n\nI would go to my apartment and tell them I had been mugged and they would help me get into my place.\n\nI hoped the old man had a good laugh about drugging and stripping me, leaving me in an alley dressed as a vag as he took my stuff. \"Live a week like us\" indeed. I'd be back in my apartment in a matter of minutes and then the police could show him what it was like to live as an inmate.\n\nI was full of indignant rage as I passed in front of the big shop window not far from my house and caught sight of myself in the reflection. At first, I thought the old man was taunting me, following me to see what I would do once I woke up, but when I rounded on him to give him a piece of my mind, I realized I was looking at my own reflection. I was the old man, his leathery skin and short gray hair, and I just stood there touching my face with my hands as I tried to make sense of it.\n\n\"Live as we live for a week if you can.\"\n\nI suddenly understood that there would be no going back to my apartment. There would be no talking to my banks or getting my phone replaced. I felt something heavy against my left butt cheek and reached into the back of my threadbare jeans to find the coin nestled there. I looked at both sides, the Emporer and the skull, and suddenly discovered I could read the words there. \n\n\"Thus the deal is struck,\" said the Emporer.\n\n\"Live or be damned by it,\" said the skull.\n\nI wanted to fling it into the street, but I remembered what he had said and slipped it back into my pocket.\n\nI had noticed something else that both sides had shared, the minting date was a week from now and that mirrored what the old man had said too.\n\n\"Live for a week as I live, if you can.\"\n\nI nodded, how hard could it be? \n\nThat first day was probably my highest point. I was full of resolve as I walked around the city. I didn't have any luck with breakfast, but that was okay. I didn't see any need to beg, I would find money if I needed it. Besides, begging would just prove that he was right. I was going to do something with my week, start a new job, or find an honest way to make money. \n\nSo, I set out to find work.\n\nOne look at myself was enough to tell me I would be turned away from most upscale jobs. I needed a shave and a haircut badly, my clothes were old and stained, and I needed a bath worse than I needed a meal. All of these things were outside my grasp without money, but I knew where I might get some of them. I had heard of the Mission Shelters, everyone had seen their billboards or heard their commercials, and I knew they had clothes I could use and maybe facilities I could use to shower. If I could get myself back to rights, then I could secure employment and not have to beg. I would likely have to spend a night or two in the Mission, but I would have a job and money and I could get back on my feet before the week was out. \n\nI came to the Mission around nine and was met at the door by a man with a clipboard.\n\n\"Good morning, sir. Are you checking in?\"\n\n\"I was hoping to get some clothes for an interview, maybe a shower and some,\"\n\n\"Terrific,\" the man said, cutting me off, \"are you part of our employment program? You don't look familiar.\"\n\n\"Well, no, but I want to use the clothes to gain employment so I can,\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, sir, those clothes are only for people in the employment program, and there is a sizable waiting list for that program. I can get you on that waiting list, but it's likely to be some time before we can,\"\n\nI started getting a little indignant, \"I mean, the clothes are donated. As a taxpayer, those are my taxes at work. I'll bring them back, I just want to look good for an interview.\"\n\nThe man's well-crafted smile was beginning to slip, \"Do you have an interview lined up, then?\"\n\nI realized my mistake and admitted I didn't.\n\n\"Well then, you have no reason to need these clothes. Now, if you would like to get on our program list, we can do that, but, again, that takes time.\"\n\nI was a little put out, the process seeming a little daunting, and told him I would like a meal and a shower if I could. \n\n\"And I want you to have those things, but if this is your first time here then we need you to fill out some paperwork so we can get you in the system. If you'll step over here we can,\"\n\n\"Do I need to register for a bowl of soup and a hot shower?\" I asked.\n\nI didn't mean to become belligerent, I was just put out by the rigamoro.\n\n\"Sir,\" the man said, \"Have you been drinking? I believe I detect alcohol on your breath, and you're becoming quite upset. We can't allow you in if you're inebriated, and you have to be twenty-four hours sober before you can enter the Mission. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.\"\n\nI said some things then, things I regret now, and I didn't even see the young bruiser who stepped between us as I got in the clipboard man's face.\n\nWhen he tossed me onto the sidewalk, the man with the clipboard saying I wasn't welcome at the Mission again, I got creakily to my feet and checked to see if I was all there.\n\nOther than some bruises, I was none the worse for wear.\n\nI was still hopeful that I could make my way without them, and so I set off to find employment.\n\nBy the end of the first day, I was shivering on a bench in a park I had never been to before. The park was less for joggers and bird watchers and more for drunks and needlers. A pair of them were sharing a syringe near an old oak tree not far away as I tried to get warm under some newspapers I had scavenged. I tried to ignore my empty belly too as I lay with the cold wood beneath me. I hadn't eaten much today, just a part of a sandwich I had found in a garbage can, and I was feeling empty as I tried to sleep.\n\nI told myself tomorrow would be better, and I fell asleep praying it would be so.\n\nJust six more days to go.\n\nThe next day I woke up ravenous, my head spinning and my mouth dry.\n\nIt was early, first light, and I knew that if I wanted to eat today I needed to get some money.\n\nAs luck would have it, I found something not far from the park. \n\nThere was a warehouse nearby, and I heard men unloading a truck as they prepared to load up another. I offered to help, most of the workers looked like scabs, and the guy with the magazine and the cigar told me that he'd beat whatever I broke out of me and to get to work. I spent a few hours moving boxes from one truck to the other, and when the guy came out and told us we were done, he put a ten-dollar bill in my hand and told me thanks. \n\n\"Come back tomorrow if you want another one,\" he said.\n\nI wanted to be happy as I looked at the crumpled bill, but I realized this wouldn't take me very far if I wasn't careful. I tried to make it last, buying coffee from a gas station along with some simple breakfast foods, but by noon it was spent. I had been walking the streets, trying to luck into more grunt work. I found another warehouse offering under-the-table work, but as the sun went down and we all came to the office to get paid, it seemed the boss had left and we were left with no other options but to disperse or answer to the police.\n\nI went back to the same park again that night, but the cold after the sun went down was too much to bear in the open.\n\nI walked around trying to find somewhere to sleep out of the elements, and around two, I found a doorway that lacked the little rounded spikes they usually put down to dissuade the homeless from sleeping there.\n\nAs I shivered in the doorway, I told myself it would only be another five days.\n\nAs I slipped into thin sleep, I hoped I would be alive to see the end of those five days.\n\nThe next day, the third day, I finally gave in and began begging. The job I had found the day before wasn't open, the gates barred and the snow deep enough to keep the trucks off the road. I was hungry, I was cold, and I didn't dare go back to the Mission. So, I found the warmest spot I could find and began panhandling. The crowd that morning was small, the snow closing a lot of businesses, and they weren't overly generous. By the time noon rolled around, I had a few dollars and some change in the can I had managed to scoop out of a dumpster. It got me some junk that wasn't very filling, and I walked around looking for work as the snow began to melt. I was a little more weary about taking odd jobs, lest I get taken like the day before, and as night began to settle and people made their way home, I once again set up to beg.\n\nI was dozing against a wall, feeling weak and tired from the cold, when someone cleared their throat loudly.\n\nI opened my eyes to find two cops standing over me, both looking cold and grumpy.\n\n\"Move along, sir. You know you can't do that here.\"\n\nHe poked my can with his foot, sending it tipping over as the small amount of change rattled out.\n\n\"I'm not hurting anyone,\" I breathed out, \"I'm just hungry.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. Hungry or not, you can't do that here. Get moving before we move you.\"\n\nI wanted to get indignant, but I simply didn't have the energy. I scooped up the coins and started trudging through the snow again. I didn't know where I was going, but I remembered the old man's words and knew I would lose that precious coin if I got arrested. I wasn't even halfway through the week and I already felt like I might not make it to reap the rewards.\n\nThe next two days were a blur. I remember trying to donate plasma and being turned away for various reasons. I looked for work, but the snow had ground a lot of businesses to a halt. I found warm places that would feed me, churches and soup kitchens, but they weren't equipped to let people stay. I ended up sleeping rough both nights, shivering on stoops or under the slight cover of alleys, my blanket soaking up the snow as it melted beneath me.\n\nIt was the most miserable I had ever been, and it made me wonder where I had ever gotten the idea that the homeless in my city were lazy. Looking back on my words to the vagrant, words spoken out of ignorance, I felt a deep sense of shame as I remembered that night. He was just trying to survive, just trying to get a meal or somewhere that wasn't a chilly bench for the night, and all I had seen was a leech trying to get fat off the hard work of others.\n\nAs I lay beside a dumpster Friday night, watching people drink in the warm lights of a familiar bar, I knew I'd never make that mistake again.\n\nSaturday dawned cold and stark, the snow melt making the ice thick on the sidewalk as the world came awake again.\n\nI had some luck after helping the owner of the store I was sleeping beside clear the ice from in front of his shop. He patted my shoulder, giving me a plastic bag of sandwiches he was about to throw away. I marveled at them, counting about twelve of the plastic-wrapped squares, and he even threw in a large cup of coffee to go along with it. I tried to tell him it was too much, but he waved his hand and laughed.\n\n\"You're doing me a favor, really. Those sandwiches were going into the garbage before I almost busted my ass on the slick sidewalk. If you can get some use out of them, more power to ya. Take them with my thanks.\"\n\nBy ten I had eaten about five of them, the coffee was long gone, and I felt full for the first time in quite a while. It was something I had taken for granted, that feeling of being nearly too full, but as I sat in the park, my blanket keeping the worst of the snow from soaking into me, it felt good to be here again. I had refilled the coffee cup from a nearby fountain, and as I drank water and soaked up the sunshine, I felt pretty good about the direction I was going. \n\n\"Hey, friend,\" came an unfamiliar voice, and my eyes snapped open as I started to bolt.\n\nIt was a man in similar dress, his face a scraggle of many days of beard growth, and he was smiling through his remaining teeth at me. I could smell him between the ten feet that separated us, but it wasn't an altogether unpleasant smell. He simply smelled earthy as opposed to bad, stale in a way that made me think he was taking care of his clothes when he could, and the jackets he wore bulged tumerously, making me think he wore at least two.\n\n\"Whoa there, didn't mean to scare you. I was just wondering if I could trade you for one of those samitches? I've got some of the vitamin C packs from the free clinic. You could mix them with that water and get something nice to drink to go along with your full belly.\"\n\nHe was holding out a crumpled silver packet with the words Emergen C on the front and I nodded as I held out a ham and cheese for him. He smiled again, asking if he could sit as he tore into the sandwich with gusto. He had clearly not been eating well, and I realized that must have been the way I had torn into the one I'd eaten earlier.\n\n\"Names Carter, good to meet you, friend. Haven't seen you around, are you new to town?\"\n\nI told him I was since it wasn't technically a lie. He laughed and told me I had picked a heck of a time to come to town. It was the worst snowstorm they had seen in a long time, and the homeless guys were having a hell of a time keeping warm. \n\n\"Between the missions and their paperwork, the cops and their endless rage for guys just trying to get by, and the shopkeepers not wanting us in their alleys or stoops, it's getting hard to find a place to lay your head most nights.\"\n\nA few others had wandered over to see who Carter was talking to, and they traded some food for sandwiches as well. I ended up giving away a few of them, and as the afternoon stretched on, they all decided to migrate somewhere to find warmth for the night.\n\nI told them goodnight, meaning to find my own place to sleep, but Carter called my name before they left the park and asked if I was coming.\n\n\"There's always room for one more around the fire,\" he said\n\nI spent that night sitting in an alley that in the middle of a four-way intersection of buildings. It cut the wind nightly, and someone had secured a tarp to keep the snow off us. The barrels here had coals burning in them, and the people who stayed here had created a kind of oasis in the swirling snow. \n\n\"It's not much,\" Carter said, \"but it's better than nothing.\"\n\nI spent the evening in the company of the other cast-offs, laughing and sharing food around as we warmed ourselves by the fires that glowed through the night. Someone had a guitar, others told stories, and I fell asleep against a wall in the best shape I had been in for the last five days. I wished I had known these people from the start, and wished I had found this place from the first day, but I was introspective enough to know that I would have insulted them when this strange journey began. This was a place I had to come to naturally, a state of mind I had to reach on my own, and as I slipped into blissful slumber, I hoped it wouldn't simply disappear when I woke up like some kind of dream.\n\nI wish it had now. \n\nThe alternative was a lot worse.\n\nI woke up to the sounds of people yelling and running. One of the barrels had been turned over, the coals making smoke as they tried to catch a sleeping bag on fire. People were screaming, scooping up what they could as people moved in the dancing shadows with purpose. I shivered beneath my blankets, certain we were getting attacked by demons, but as the shapes got closer, I saw they were police officers. \n\nThey had discovered our camp, and now they were taking away our one refuge from the cold.\n\nI sat as still as I could, trying to be still and unseen, and when they moved away, I made a break for the nearest alley. I saw flashing lights and heard someone yell at me, but I just kept kicking up snow as I ran for my life. The sun was turning the horizon into a hopeful pink, but I just kept moving. When people got in my way, I went around them. When bus stops or stoops rose up to block me, I moved around them too. I didn't dare stop until the sun beat down on my neck, and only then it was because I just couldn't go anymore.\n\nMy legs were tired, my head spinning from over-excursion, and when I flopped down onto a bench in a bus shell, I was out of breath.\n\nI kept trying to make sense of what had happened, but it just wouldn't mesh in my brain. Why had they come after us? We weren't hurting anyone, we were just looking for a warm place to gather. They had come in like we were terrorists, and I hoped that Carter and some of my other friends had made it away. \n\nI don't know how long I sat there, but as my stomach started to growl, I knew I would need food. I thought I might put my hat out and try to get some money. The longer I just sat there with my eyes closed, the more I wondered what the point was? The oasis now felt like a dirty trick. They had allowed me a moment of happiness so they could pull the rug out just as I thought I might have found something better. I almost preferred the uncertainty of not knowing what to expect, I thought, and as the day passed and I continued to sit on the cold metal bench. What was the point, after all? If everything could change in a second, if all safety was just an illusion, then why do anything?\n\n\"Enjoying your new life of leisure?\"\n\nI jumped, realizing someone had sat down beside me.\n\nI opened my eyes and realized it was me. I looked exactly the same as I always did in the mirror, but I realized it had to be the old man pretending to be me. As I sat here, day had become night and, just like that, we had passed seven days. I had done it, I had weathered the storm, and I liked to hope I was a better person for it.\n\n\"Just basking in my newfound sense of understanding,\" I answered, realizing it was true.\n\nI took the grubby coin from my pocket and held it in my hand, feeling a strange warmth coming from it as we sat in the chill.\n\n\"Well, you made it, and a deal is a deal. What will you wish for now that you have all this knowledge?\"\n\nI put the coin in his hand, feeling the warmth transfer between us.\n\n\"I want the means to make sure no one else has to live like this. I want to help people, even if it's just in this town. Is that too vague?\"\n\nHe closed his hand around the coin, and I felt that warmth radiate through my stomach.\n\n\"I can work with that.\"\n\nI opened my eyes and suddenly I was me again.\n\nI was sitting there as if waiting for a bus, and when I got up, I knew what I had to do.\n\nIt was hard starting out, but the backers came and the money came and slowly I fed them.\n\nSlowly, I brought them off the street and gave them a place to stay.\n\nA decade ago, I took a coin from a beggar.\n\nToday, I own one of the largest shelters in the city. There are no confusing forms, no prerequisites, and no red tape. We feed those who are hungry, we house those in need, and when I see the hope in their eyes, I know my wish has come true."

I wasn't abused in the traditional sense. I was well-kept, I was well-fed, and I really wanted for nothing except my freedom.\n\nIt all started one day when I visited a new therapist.\n\nDr. McAllister had been recommended by a friend of mine. He said that he was very good and that he had helped him get through a lot of the issues he had with his mother and discover some things about his sexuality. He put you under and put you in touch with your real self, and that was how he overcame a lot of your issues. It all sounded great to me. I'd been having trouble sleeping and was looking for some way to get the sleep I needed to function. My insomnia would sometimes last for days, and it was starting to affect my life.\n\nSo, I made an appointment, and two weeks later, I was lying on his couch listening to Dr. McAllister countdown from ten as he put me in a suggestive trance.\n\nIt was very sudden, like blinking, but everything changed after that trance.\n\nWhen I came out just as suddenly, Dr. McAllister looked strange, and I asked if something had happened?\n\nStrange may not be descriptive enough.\n\nHe looked somehow enraptured, enlightened, utterly worshipful.\n\n\"You…you spoke to me about things that you couldn't possibly have known. You talk to me about my childhood. You helped me get over the death of my mother. You helped me more in this hour-long session than I've ever helped anyone.\"\n\nI wasn't sure what he was talking about, but when he gripped my hand, his eyes shone with the light of a zealot.\n\n\"I need more. Please let me put you back under so I can discover more.\"\n\nI pulled away from him and took a huge step back. What the hell was he talking about? I had come here for help, but suddenly he wanted me to help him. I had to get out of here. I had to leave now. McAllister tried to stop me, but I was out the door before he could say much more than stop. I didn’t sleep well that night either, and it became a real problem. Sometimes I would lay in my bed and swear I heard whispers, but I put it off as auditory hallucinations. I hadn’t slept well for the past three weeks, and I knew it was starting to catch up to me. When I would force myself out of the house for work or to run errands, I could swear I felt someone watching me. What's more, I could swear I’d catch glimpses of someone out of the corner of my eye, but they would always be gone when I turned to look at them. It never happened in my house, always when I was out and about, and the paranoia on top of the sleep deprivation was slowly eroding my sanity.\n\nSo when I heard someone open a window in my living room one night, I rolled over and just thought it was me having paranoid hallucinations.\n\nTurns out it hadn’t been hallucinations.\n\nWhen I heard someone open my bedroom door, I rolled over and found Dr. McAllister standing there watching me. He looked like he hadn’t been sleeping well either, and his eyes looked crazed as we stood looking at each other. I wasn’t sure if he was real or not, but when he lunged at me, I curled into a ball and cried out for him to stop. He didn’t attack me though, didn’t hurt me at all, though I now wish he had killed me right there.\n\nInstead, he just slipped a needle into my arm and as I watched his thumb push down the plunger, I felt waves of warm and inviting sleep roll through me.\n\nI woke up in a finished basement, the lights turned down low, strapped to a chair as Doctor McAllister made sure my bindings were comfortable. I struggled, my limbs heavy and uncoordinated, but he held up a fresh needle and told me that if I didn’t calm down, he was going to put me out again. I made myself as still as I could, not sure what to expect here. This didn’t seem to be a sexual thing, I was fully dressed, and the way he was tending to me almost felt worshipful.\n\n“I didn’t want it to come to this, but I can’t live without the knowledge you possess. I know you don’t believe what I’m saying, but while you were unconscious you told me about things that may very well change my life. You spoke to me of things that opened my eyes, ideas I had never even conceived of, and the longer I went without hearing your voice again, the more I felt my newfound serenity crumbling. I’m sorry, I’m not usually like this, but I had to possess you, to have your knowledge, and to understand your words. I can promise you that while you remain with me you will want for nothing. You are, to me, as a captured God that I wish to understand.”\n\nWe talked a lot that night, though I mostly yelled at him to let me go, but, in the end, he just injected me with something to knock me out and I drifted off into a peaceful unconsciousness.\n\nAnd that was how I became Doctor McAllisters captive God.\n\nI will say that, while I was with him, I never wanted for restful sleep.\n\nThis was due in part to the fact that I spend most of my time in a near-catatonic state. Doctor McAllister kept me restrained in a large underground area that I always thought of as The Basement. I was seated in a large comfortable chair, my hands secured to the arms with soft straps. There was a remote at hand, I was allowed to watch anything I wanted on television as long as the Doctor was away. If I was hungry all I had to do was push a button and a short blond woman who I would later discover was the Doctor’s Wife would bring me anything I wanted. \n\nIn the beginning, it wasn’t so bad. I was kept in a sluggish state from the drugs he used on me to induce the state he wanted, but it wasn’t bad. I watched tv, I ate, and I existed. Given that I had worked forty-plus hour work weeks and lived off crappy food for most of my adult life, it felt almost like pampering. I was free to do what I liked, except leave or talk to people who were likely wondering what had happened to me. My mom, my dad, my friend, did any of them wonder what had happened to me? It may seem odd to you that I never tried to escape, but my head was always in a cloud of some sort. The drugs left me just lucid enough to consume tv or audiobooks, but I never felt able to really settle my thoughts on anything in particular. I knew I should want to escape, but it was always a hard concept to catch hold of. \n\nThose days were the good days, back when Dr. McAllister was still operating his practice.\n\nThat was when McAllister was still pretending to have a normal life.\n\nHe would come down in the evenings and talk with me, just telling me his problems and asking me to help. He would ask me about stocks or bonds, the housing market, business ideas, patents, and inventions, and I would try my best to direct him in the way he wanted. I wasn’t sure what he wanted, my head was too foggy most of the time to make any sense of it, but I would try my best to help him without the need to be placed into an unconscious state. We’d talk for hours about everything from the state of his marriage, the depraved childhood he had lived through, the future of psychology, and even the condition of his soul. I didn’t always want to hear what he had to say, but I understood that it didn’t really matter what I wanted.\n\nIt didn’t seem to matter, anyway.\n\nWe would talk for hours but the end result was always a needle in my arm or my neck and several hours of blissful unconsciousness. I remember little from these periods of blackout, fortunately, but sometimes I would go to a dark place and just hang suspended in the murk. Things would whisper to me there, tell me things I couldn’t understand, and I was powerless to stop them. This happened very rarely, but it was still too often for my tastes. I don’t know what I said to Doctor McAllister in those times, but there was always a drastic change when I came back to myself.\n\nIt wasn’t always for the better, either.\n\nOnce I came back to myself and felt something wet in my lap. I glanced down, which was difficult because my head was strapped to the headrest, and found that someone had thrown a head into my lap. I flinched away from it as my soggy brain finally clicked it all together, but it was little more than a shudder in my current state. The head had wispy gray hair, a pair of broken glasses hanging across the face by one ear, and a nose full of broken veins from a lifetime of drinking. I didn’t recognize it, but as it soaked the pants of my pajamas, I did feel like it was familiar somehow.  \n\nDoctor McAllister was sitting across from me, looking expectantly at the gift he had literally dropped in my lap, and I looked at it with confusion as I asked why he had done this?\n\n“You told me to,” he said, a little shocked, “You said if I meant to truly get over the cruelty and abuse that my father had given me, then I had to destroy the icon of my father within myself. So I did. I told him that I wanted to meet so we could discuss our past and reconcile. He was ecstatic, he hadn’t seen me in twenty years, and oh did we reconcile. I waited for him to turn around and I bashed his head in with a hammer, choking him to death as he lay twitching on the floor. Then I took the body and disposed of it, cutting the head off so I could show you that I had followed instructions. You are so wise, so correct, and I am your loyal disciple.”\n\nI started screaming, mindless gibbering noise, but he just bowed to me, and when the head hit the ground next to him he didn’t even flinch.\n\nThat was my first inclination that the things I was saying in my sleep might be used in ways I had never considered.\n\nAfter that, he started bringing people down to see me.\n\nAt first, it was his wife, the blonde woman who had been feeding me. She looked skeptical as she approached, content to keep her husband's secrets but unsure of joining him in this new experiment. I knew from our talks that he was afraid she would leave him, but enjoyed the financial stability of their marriage. \n\nHe stuck me with the needle as she sat a few feet away, and when I came to she was bowing and crying and she thanked me for helping her see the truth.\n\n“My husband was right. You are truly a God. I was wrong to ever doubt him, or you.”\n\nAfter that, it was friends and colleagues.\n\nThey all seemed confused when he introduced them to me, calling me his God of Knowledge, and some of them laughed, thinking it was a joke. They would sit and talk to me, listening to my answers and looking at McAllister as if to ask if this were some elaborate prank? In the end, though, when I came back from the little naps he would subject me to, it was always the same. Their smirk of disbelief or scowl of confusion was replaced with rapturous awe and they would pledge their undying fealty to me. \n\nNo matter how many of them I begged to release me, the outcome was always the same.\n\nOver time, a religion of sorts began to form.\n\nOver time, McAllister drew in his cult. \n\nIt was only a few at first, five or ten, but it began to grow into a sizable flock. The followers began to take care of me, washing and feeding and seeing to my every whim except the most important. I would ask them to release me, beg them to let me go, but it was always interpreted as a test of some sort. Their God was testing them to see if they were loyal to the here or to the hereafter and they would thank me for helping them fortify their belief in me as they slid my hands back into the restraints or pushed my head back into the buckles. I yelled at them, called them idiots, and tried to push them, but the constant use of sedatives and the lack of exercise had made me weak. I wasn’t wasting away, but I wasn’t getting the exercise I needed, to be certain. I could do little to free myself, my bonds always replaced, and after a while, I just gave in.\n\nThe funny thing was that whatever I was telling them while I was under was working.\n\nMcAllister showed me the money he had made, won, earned from stock and selling property, and the Cult thrived. What's more, they all claimed to have cast off whatever addiction or mental health problems or childhood trauma had plagued them and were addicted now to nothing but serving me. Like McAllister had said, those who tried to leave or to return to their lives reported feeling hopeless and manic unless they could return to my presence and hear my words, whatever they were.\n\nThat was when things began to get bad.\n\nMcAllister was truly addicted to my influence and it led him to overstep.\n\nMcAllister had been gathering his followers at his home, and while it was large, it was becoming too small to hold all of them. I can’t really speculate on how many were there, but the basement was standing-room only. I sat beneath a small bar that he was standing on, and the sea of bodies was dizzying. Though he was speaking, they all looked at me as if I were speaking through him. So many eyes looking at me, my body still held in the chair I had sat in for God knew how long, was something I never got used to. It never made me feel like a deity, it never made me feel powerful to have them worship me.\n\nI always felt like a pet, its freedom just one opened door away.\n\nMcAllister said they would be moving to a new place soon, a place that would house them all comfortably. They could all stay there indefinitely, leaving their jobs and lives behind so they could care for their captive God. He didn’t say where it was, but he said they would all go this afternoon and to prepare for a long journey. They were all so happy, their faces enraptured as he told them of their new home, but I began to feel that this would never end.\n\nWhen he began to bring people to see me, I had hoped that someone would fail to see me as he did and get me out of here. They would take me away from him, they would call the police, and I would be saved from my captivity. That never happened, whatever power I had held them in sway and after a while I doubted that I would ever get out of here. I didn’t know how long I had been McAllister’s Captive God, but I knew that no matter how comfortable the life, this had to end. \n\nI decided then that if they weren’t going to get me out, I would have to do it myself.\n\nStrangely, my chance came that very day.\n\nThey had all left me so they could prepare, and as I sat in the shadowy basement, I realized that my wrist strap was undone. This had never happened before, and for a moment I wasn't sure what to do. It took all the energy I had to focus enough to get that hand to undo the other strap, and when I bent down to undo my legs, the effort seemed to take years. My mind was like unraveled yarn, and it was hard to focus on any particular task. When the bonds came off my legs, I got shakily to my feet before bending to rub some life into them. They were prickly from lack of use, and I took shaky steps as I made for the stairs.\n\nI got to the top before I was discovered.\n\nI peeked through the door and into the barren kitchen beyond. The cupboards were empty, the countertops clean, and I could tell that this room had already been cleaned out for the move. I had just decided to take a step out and make for the back door when someone walked into the kitchen and saw me. They called for McAllister, walking to me as they insisted I return to my chair. I pushed at them, telling them to get out of my way, but as I lunged for the back door, I heard others coming in to stop me. I made it to the backyard, squinting as the sun hit my eyes, but found it fenced with tall wooden boards. I was grabbed then by many hands, and when someone slipped a needle into my neck, I looked back to see McAllister instructing them to get me to the car.\n\nI came to some time later and I was laying in an elaborate bed, my hands cuffed to the frame.\n\nThat began the worst part of my confinement, though it was thankfully the end of it.\n\nAfter that, the drugging became worse. McAllister and his inner circle kept me in a near-constant catatonic state. The drugs he used were no longer just injected, and they began to experiment with other substances. The documents that were found later said they received different outcomes when different kinds of drugs were used, and they often sat around and drank or laughed as I came in and out of reality. I was aware of nothing in those times, a ship drifting on a sea of time. I could have been with them for days, I could have spent decades under their control, but to me, time was only islands glimpsed from afar. I didn’t see many people in that time, just the five or so who were in McAllister’s inner circle, but these men always spoke as if they were doing very well. Often there was cigar smoke around my bed, the smell of expensive liquor, and always the low murmur of talk as they waited for me to tell them what else they might do to gain more power. I had become their oracle, their captive God as opposed to a revered deity, and they threatened to use me up.  \n\nThese are the times I remember the least about, except for the end.\n\nI spent a lot of my days in a black stupor, and the more they experimented, the more often I was back in the black place. When I came back from these trances, I noticed a change in my captor. Gone were the shining eyes of the enraptured. Disappeared were the weeping orbs of the enlightened. They were replaced by the flinty eyes of the zealot, and I was afraid that he might break his promise. He looked angry, but also resolved. Whatever I had told him weighed heavily on him, but I wouldn’t understand the burden for a while yet.\n\nNot till the day it all came to an end. \n\nI came to one afternoon to find an intrusive light leaking into my dark chamber. They had always kept me in this persistently dark room, but now the door was open, and something was laying in it. On the floor there were others, none of them moving, and I was confused by their sudden stillness. Was this something new? Were they sleeping or…were they… I tried to put that thought out of my mind. They couldn’t be dead, I reminded myself as I shook my chains. If they were all dead, then who would free me so I didn’t die here too.\n\n“I did as you said,” came a monotone voice, and I jumped as I realized one of the slumped forms had only been praying.\n\nIt was McAllister and he looked wild. His salt and pepper hair was sticking up at odd angles and his face was spattered with blood. His shirt was soaked in something and it hung on him like a wet sack. He appeared to be praying, but as something clicked in his shaking hands, I saw that he had a gun. I was afraid that he would shoot me too for half a second, but as he put it under his chin, I became even more afraid that he would use it on himself.\n\n“I have risen as high as I can. Your will dictates that I must shed my vehicle to rise any higher. I shall see you on the other side.” \n\nHis blood made a crimson line across my face as the gun went off, and suddenly my fear was realized.\n\nI was alone.\n\nLuckily for me, someone heard that gunshot.\n\nI would lay in that bed for two days before the FBI came to investigate the compound. It turned out they had been keeping an eye on McAllister for quite some time, ever since he had started gathering followers at his home. After two years in his new compound, they had been trying to prepare a case against him before he woke up one morning and decided to put an end to his little flock. With the help of his wife, they had poisoned the morning meal and McAllister had drawn his inner circle to a meeting before breakfast where he shot them as they sat and listened to my latest ramblings. \n\nThey had found journals that claimed these were things I had told him to do, but after interviewing me, I think they decided he was out of his mind.\n\nAt least, that's what Agent Maxet led me to believe.\n\n“We’re going to have to hold you as a person of interest, but it honestly sounds like you were an unwilling participant. I’m going to go and get some things in order, have a seat in here and we’ll make some accommodations for you.”\n\nAfter he left, I noticed the recorder sitting on the table. It wasn’t running, which I had expected, and when I reached for it, I saw that the tape inside had a date on it that I remembered. It was the date of my first session with Doctor McAllister. I couldn’t imagine a reason behind the FBI having a tape with that date on it unless McAllister had recorded it for some reason. I put the recorder back down, trying to stop my curiosity before it could take root.\n\nI had never heard what I sounded like in that state that seemed to enrapture the old doctor so much.\n\nWhat had I said to him to make him throw his whole life away in the pursuit of it?\n\nI couldn’t help myself. I hit play on the recording and listened as McAllister told me to be calm and began to count down from ten. It wasn’t the jagged, often flighty voice I remembered from any time after this session. This was McAllister at his most sane, and as he came to one, I heard him gasp and ask what I was doing.\n\nFrom the recording, I heard a slightly deeper version of my own voice, and it filled me with dread.\n\n“Agent Maxet has listened to the tapes, and he’s becoming as unstable as the good doctor. If you don’t escape now, I fear that he’ll have you just like McAllister did. You’ll have to be quick and you’ll have to be smart, but if you mean to be free, you need to find a way to get out of here. Good luck.”"

        "selftext": "My Grandpa was an odd guy.\n\n\n\nHe was clearly wealthy, but no one was ever sure how. He lived frugally, in a small house on a quarter of an acre, with a sensible car, and nothing too fancy in the house. If you'd driven past it you would have assumed some old timer on a pension was just moldering away his golden years there, and you would have been right in some ways.\n\n\n\nWhere he showed his wealth was in his generosity. Grandpa liked to give. He gave the best Christmas presents, had the best candy for Halloween, donated to charities, and liked to see people happy. If you asked him how he could afford to be so generous, however, he would always just wink and say he had his way. Not even my Grandmother knew where his money came from, and they were married for fifty years.\n\n\n\nSo when he died, we all wondered who would inherit his mysterious fortune.\n\n\n\nMy cousins had loved Grandpa, grandkids always do, but the two of us had always been close. My old man hadn't even waited till I was born to go grab some milk and cigarettes, and Grandma and Grandpa had helped my Mom raise me so she could go to work. I have a lot of fond memories of sitting with my Grandpa and watching TV, taking walks around the neighborhood, and eating ice cream at this little shop on the corner. He would always tell me to appreciate the little things because the smallest thing could be the one that changes my life the most.\n\n\n\n\"Take this,\" he would say, showing me the door knocker he often carried in his pocket, \"I found this when I was a very young man, sifting through trash in a landfill as I looked for bottles to sell. It became my lucky charm and it changed my life forever.\"\n\n\n\nGrandpa carried that door knocker for as long as I had known him, and it was pretty unique. It was a brass hand holding an apple and it was all meticulously crafted in exhausting detail. The fingers had individual nails, the apple had a stem and leaves, and even the knuckles had wrinkles on them had been carefully worked. I couldn't believe, as a young child, that Grandpa had just pulled this out of a dump, but he carried it everywhere, and I suppose it did bring him luck.\n\n\n\nThe funeral was beautiful, everyone there having nothing but kind words for Grandpa and his family. After the service, my three cousins and I were asked to come to a will reading at the Lawyer's Office and Grandpa had been as generous in death as he was in life. My cousins had received a trust fund for each of them, the amount payable on their thirtieth birthday with a small living expense each month. Grandpa hadn't left a trust for me but he had left me his little house, which I was pretty glad for.\n\n\n\nMom had recently married and, though I liked Mike a lot, it had seemed a little weird to have her adult son living in the house she was trying to make a new life in. Grandpa's old house was the perfect size for me, a college student with no real prospects of marriage in the near future. It was close enough to campus that I thought it would be ideal, but the lawyer had one more thing to give me.\n\n\n\n\"Your Grandfather was also very clear that I give you this,\" he said, handing me Grandpa's lucky charm, the brass door knocker.\n\n\n\nI thanked him, thinking I might hang it somewhere in the house in Grandpa's memory. It seemed only fitting to make a little memorial wall out of it. After all, Grandpa had loved the thing and it had been his only constant possession for years.\n\n\n\nSo, I moved in that day, taking my things and wishing my mom and stepdad goodbye as I, too, embarked on a new life.\n\n\n\nOver the next few days, I changed the house around a little. I hung my flat screen on the wall, I moved Grandpa's favorite chair around, I added my books to his bookshelf, and I donated his clothes and some of his other things to one of his favorite charities in town. I think Gramps would like the thought that his stuff would help people in need, and they were very thankful. A few of them offered condolences, having read about his death in the paper. Grandpa bought a lot of his stuff from Goodwill and Habitat for Humanity, but he also donated a lot so he was well-known to them.  \n\n\n\nIt was Friday, about four days after the funeral, when I noticed the knocker on the counter and remembered my plans to hang it and make a memorial wall.\n\n\n\nI didn't have anything else planned for that day, so it seemed like a fine pursuit.\n\n\n\nI hung the knocker in the living room, putting it above a little shelf where I put some candles and a picture of Grandad. I put his wallet up there too, something else he was never without, and I added a tin of Altoids, a pocket watch I had seen him wear, and a few other pictures of him. The door knocker was the centerpiece and it all looked very nice when I got done. As I finished I stepped back and admired it, thinking that Grandpa would have liked it too.\n\n\n\nThat night was the first time I heard the knocking.  \n\n\n\nI was lying in bed, doing some doom scrolling before I went to sleep when suddenly I heard a loud thump from the living room. I took out my earbud and listened, wondering if something had fallen over or maybe someone was at the door, but I didn't hear anything. I shrugged, thinking it had been my imagination, but just before I could slip the earbud back in, I heard it again.\n\n\n\nThree long booms from the living room and then silence.\n\n\n\nI got up, wondering who would be knocking on my door at this time of night. I went to the front door and looked out the peephole. I opened the door to see if someone was joking around, but there was no one there. The front porch was empty, and Grandpa didn't have bushes or anything to hide behind. The kid or whoever would have to be the freaking Flash to make it off the porch without being seen and I closed the door and started to go back to bed.\n\n\n\nI had come to the hallway that led there when I heard it again.\n\n\n\nThree long booms and then silence.\n\n\n\nI turned back, looking at the door, but there was nothing. The knocking hadn't come from the door, I would have been able to tell. No, it had come from the living room. I glanced around, looking for someone at a window or maybe the rattle of a woodpecker on the eaves, but there was nothing.\n\n\n\nI decided to just go to bed and try to make sense of it later, but that wasn't the last time I heard it.\n\nI heard the knocking a couple of times over the weekend, but I could never quite nail down where it was coming from. It was always either one, two, or three knocks followed by a ten-second pause and then the same number of knocks before it stopped. By Monday I was pulling my hair out, wondering if it was the pipes or something in the walls, and then finally I caught it.\n\n\n\nI had found a wedding picture of my grandparents sitting in a desk drawer, something Grandpa had probably put away so he wouldn't miss her, and decided it would look better on the shelf with his other memories. I was adding the wedding picture beside one of Gramps accepting an award for philanthropy when the knocker on the wall suddenly rattled and thumped. I jumped back, not sure what to make of it, but it thumped once, twice, three times, and was quiet for about ten seconds. I had just thought it might be a fluke or something when it did it again.\n\n\n\nThump, thump, thump, and then silence.\n\n\n\nI took it off the wall and looked for some kind of motor or something, but it was just a normal brass knocker.\n\n\n\nIt happened two more times that day and I was extremely curious as to what made it do it and why. I started going through Grandpa's desk, hoping for some explanation, and that's when I found the letter. It was in the middle of a ledger book, addressed to me, and it wasn't even sealed, which was unlike Gramps. It was just a single page of notebook paper, and I was glad to see Grandpa's cramped handwriting speaking to me from the page.\n\n\n\n*I hope you're enjoying the house, and I hope you found this letter in a timely manner. I had considered leaving it to Wilson to give to you, but I thought it might be better if you came across it naturally. Also, I wanted you to receive the knocker, and Wilson may have decided to keep it if he'd read the letter. He's a good man, an honest man, but greed can do funny things to people. You have probably noticed by now that the door knocker taps on its own sometimes. You wouldn't believe how I discovered its power, a complete accident, but I swear that what I'm about to tell you is absolutely true.*\n\n\n\n*The door knocker opens doors to different places. Place it on a door and wait for the knocks. Once it knocks, open the door and travel to where it takes you. The knocker only has three destinations, but they have been of great benefit to me and our family. When it knocks, you will have ten seconds to open the door. The second set of knocks is the doorway closing so it won't work if you catch it on the second set.* \n\n\n\n*One knock opens onto the Treasury, a room of treasures. Coins, gems, gold, all piled to the ceiling. If anything guards it, it has never bothered me, but I am always careful not to take too much.*\n\n\n\n*Two knocks opens onto the Library, a room stuffed with bookshelves. You can spend hours, days even, in this place and time won't pass outside the door. I have learned so many things here, things lost to time, and read about things that have yet to happen.*\n\n\n\n*Three knocks opens onto a Void, a darkness that I dare not enter. Anything you put in here will be gone, anything. There is no ground inside it, though, so don't walk in. I am ashamed to say that it's where I've been putting my trash, but it's also where I hid your dog, the one I said ran away when you were very young. He died suddenly, just lay over and died, and I put him in before you woke up from your nap. I’m sorry I never told you, but you were so young when it happened that I didn’t think you would mourn him for long.*\n\n\n\n*The knocks are never consistent, but each knock seems to come at least once a day. The three knocks usually come in the evening or early afternoon, one knock is usually in the morning or before noon, and the two knocks come's when it will. While you are inside, don't let the door close. I was stuck in the library for a long, long time once and was fortunate that your Uncle came along and opened the door. Time doesn't affect people the same way inside the door as it does here, so spend as much time as you want there. If you get hurt, however, you will still be injured, so be careful. You and I have always been close, and I know you and your cousins have speculated for years about my mysterious fortune. The knocker is yours to do with what you will, but always remember that money breeds difficulty, which is why I have always kept it a secret.*\n\n\n\n*Good luck, I love you, kiddo.*\n\n\n\nI read through the note a few times, trying to make sense of it. There was no way. Grandpa had always been sharp, not real problems mentally, but this sounded like the mad ramblings of a lunatic. The knocker, however, had moved on its own, that much was true. It occurred to me that there was a way to test the rest of it, so I decided to do just that.\n\n\n\nI took the knocker off the wall where I had hung it and attached it to the closet door in the living room. It looked a little silly there, a door knocker on a door that opened onto a closet with two coats and a bunch of board games in it, but I wanted to be sure. It was silly, the kind of thing you read about in fairy tales, but I wanted to be sure.\n\n\n\nI had a while to wait, but it finally happened just as I was thinking of going to bed.\n\n\n\nIt was around ten thirty and I was reaching for the remote to turn the TV off when I heard it. Two loud knocks, seconds apart, on the closet door. I popped up, remembering I had ten seconds to get there, and threw the door open. I expected to find the same closet that he had been there earlier. I expected this to be a joke from my Grandfather. What I didn't expect to find the great library he had talked about on the other side.\n\n\n\nIt was huge, a library to rival any I had ever seen, and the windows shone with perfect sunlight as I stood in shock. The shelves were tall, taller than the roof of the house I stood in, and they had long, trestled ladders with wheels to slide along the floor. I could see a grand staircase, and I felt sure there would be levels above the next as well. I could learn anything in there, I could learn everything in there, but I remembered what Grandpa had said about not getting closed inside and looked for something to prop the door open with. I saw an end table and pulled it over to put in the way, stepping inside and marveling at the space.\n\n\n\nI spent hours perusing books. There were books on languages, on history, on science, on anything I would want to know. I only explored the first floor that night, but there was enough here to keep me reading for days, maybe months. I was studying architecture at College, and there was a whole section of books I could use to study any period, any style, and anything else I wanted. This place was like the library they talked about in Alexandria, the library in the Harry Potter books, and some kind of wizard's private collection from a fantasy novel all rolled into one. Time may have moved differently here, but it didn't stop me from getting tired. I had been excited when I came in, but after a couple of hours of looking at books I was yawning and rubbing my eyes.\n\n\n\nI decided to come back another time and let the door close as I pushed the end table out of the way.\n\n\n\nIt was true, I couldn't believe it, but I had seen it myself.\n\n\n\nGrandpa had a magic door knocker!\n\n\n\nI spent the next few days testing each knock pattern, and Grampa's observations had been spot-on. I found the room with the gold in it the next day and it was almost more impressive than the library. Think of a room full of any kind of money you could want. Gold bars, US currency, ancient denari, little stones with things scratched on them, gems, pearls, silver nuggets, and other things I didn't have names for. I reached for a stack of hundreds with shaky hands and brought them out before letting the door close again. I had made about two grand in a matter of seconds, and I put it somewhere safe before heading to class. The Void was a little scarier when I got it, but I had been setting garbage bags beside the door in case I was home when the knock came.\n\n\n\nThe Void was just what it claimed to be. It was like looking out at the night sky, except there were no stars. It was an inky, unnatural blackness, and I wondered if maybe Nietzsche had been describing this place when he talked about staring into the abyss. The space was utterly devoid of anything, but it seemed to crouch as well, just waiting for me to drop my guard. The bags went in, falling into a soundless, airless void, before I closed the door again.\n\n\n\nIt was great for a while, truly a blessing. I had all the money I needed, and whatever I took seemed to come back after I shut the door. I could take books from the library if I needed to, and anything I left on the work tables would put itself back on the shelf. I spent a lot of time in the library when I could get there, and sometimes I would wake up to find I had fallen asleep. The door never slammed shut and trapped me in there, and without anyone to come behind me and accidentally close it I felt safe in there. I learned so much in a relatively short time, and my professors were impressed with my knowledge. I considered bringing them the books I used to gain this knowledge, but thought better of it. How would I explain it to them? A guy in his early twenties who just happened to have a book that was probably hundreds of years old was something that would probably gain the attention of the wrong sort of people.\n\n\n\nI was careful not to use too much of the money, careful not to spread it around too much, and careful not to show anyone the books from the library.\n\n\n\nIt went well for about four months, but then I started getting knocks of another sort from the door.\n\n\n\nIt started subtly, with little knocks and taps from time to time. I'm sure I missed a lot of them, but I would sometimes look up if I was watching TV or something, expecting to see the knocker tapping but find it silent. I started watching the door closer, seeing strange lights waft beneath it sometimes. They would skitter across the bottom, like strange shadows, and I found myself watching them more than the TV after a while. My trips to the other places were still uneventful, the landscapes the same as they had always been, but it was the times in between the knocks that I came to dread.\n\n\n\nThen, one night, something knocked back.\n\n\n\nI was brushing my teeth when I heard a familiar boom sound three times. I checked the clock and saw it was nearly eleven, a little late for knocking but I stuck my head out to look at the door, nonetheless. The toothbrush was still half in my mouth, and I had expected to see nothing stranger than the knocker fall back into place.\n\n\n\nInstead, something knocked again, and it wasn't the knocker.\n\n\n\nI came slowly out of the bathroom, watching as strange lights came flashing from between the cracks in the door. It was like a haunted house attraction, and I almost expected to see smoke billowing out from underneath it. The knocks were shy, almost uncertain, and I was preparing to head to my room when something hit the door hard enough to shake it in the frame. I jumped back, not sure what to make of it, and when it hit it again, I fell onto my butt and just watched it shake.\n\n\n\nWhatever was knocking was adamant about getting in, and it slammed its weight into the door again and again. The knob rattled, the door shook, and the lights flashed faster and angrier. My teeth were chattering, this had never happened before, and I was terrified that whatever it was might get through. It slammed into it again, the old wooden door cracking in the frame, and when it struck this time, I saw something break through the surface and come grabbing blindly from within.\n\n\n\nIt was an arm, a long, purple arm covered in scales.\n\n\n\nIt thrashed around, trying to find something to grab, and the sounds from within were like bats and birds turned up to a thousand. It shivered right on the edge of hearing and I expected my ears to start bleeding. It was looking for the knob, and I wasn't sure what would happen if it found it.\n\nInstead, it bumped into the knocker.\n\n\n\nIt fell off the door, it was only held on by a couple of screws, and as it clattered onto the floor, the most hellish sound of all ripped from the hole before being cut off as suddenly as it had begun.\n\n\n\nThe lights, the noise, and the banging all stopped with a suddenness that made me dizzy.\n\n\n\nI stood up, looking at the broken door, and walked slowly into the living room to see the extent of the damage. Something was bumping, but I thought maybe the arm had knocked something over. I wanted to make sure the knocker was okay, but as I came around Grandpa's old chair, I saw what was making all the noise.\n\n\n\nIt was the arm that had come through the door. It was leaking black fluid all over the hardwood and flopping around like a fish.\n\n\n\nIt didn't flop for long, but now I'm left with a problem.\n\n\n\nThe portal only seems to open when the knocker is up, but unless it's up, I can't open it.\n\n\n\nI wonder if this is why my Grandpa kept it with him so often.\n\n\n\nDid he, perhaps, have a visitor one night when he least expected it?\n\n\n\nFor now, I'm keeping the knocker in my bedside table, but even as I lay here writing this, I can hear it bump against the wood every now and again.\n\n\n\nThe money will eventually run out, that or my curiosity to learn will get the better of me, and I'll hang the knocker again, but I think, for now, I'll let it sit.\n\n\n\nNo need to invite trouble if I don't have to.  \n\n \n\nMy Inheritance had some strange rules"

One day as I was headed to school, i hear a loud knocking coming one of the rooms. There stood a man, with a creepy almost plastic grin on his face. I didnt know what to do, i froze in place as i just stared at him. He was still knocking on the glass door, but his hands were not moving. He was using his head, moving back and fourth. Let me make it clear, the knocks were quite loud echoing in the little collection buildings around us. His eyes were still glued at me and his plastic grin was looking just the same as it was once out eyes met. i managed to collect my self and run, i ran so fast i could barely feel my feet under me. \n\nthe next day he stood there again, knocking on the window with his upper half of the body, back an forth slamming his own head into the glass door. so hard i was afraid it would shatter, he didn't seem to mind though. \n\nthis kept on going, the naked man in the glass door, he always had the same horrifying plastic fake grin. This still happens from time to time, but a week after the first incident he started having the camera ready. every time as i walked by he stood there ready with the camera, still banging his head too the glass. I managed to avoid him a few times by changing the times i left from home. No matter what time i left, he always found me again in the end followed my routine. \n\ntoday I am 17 soon 18 and so happy that in a few weeks i am moving.

        "selftext": "I'm making this record as a warning to all who may come across it - never, NEVER! attempt to enter the catacombs of Paris through secret passage that lies hidden beneath the streets of the city. For within those dark and winding tunnels, there is something inexplicable and evil that resides the forbidden tunnels lurking beneath the City of Light.\n\nFirst I would like to point out that the people I will mention here have had their names changed with the intention of protecting their memories and their identities. I hope that my decision is understood and respected by all.\n\nWith that in mind, I will now begin the account of my Paris catacomb experience that forever marked my life.\n\nLike any other young person my age, I was very adventurous and loved exploring unknown places, always looking for thrills and challenges.\n\nMy parents were always very strict with me, forbidding me to go to places they considered \"inappropriate\" like parties and going out with friends. I felt trapped, like I was being deprived of experiencing the outside world like other young people. Which only fueled even more the desire to venture outside the limits imposed on me.\n\nLike any other young person my age, I became rebellious.\n\nI lied to my parents that I was going somewhere, but I was breaking into an abandoned house or exploring some tunnel or underground cave with my friends who shared the same interests.\n\nBut that wasn't enough.\n\nI wanted to go further, see new things and feel more of that butterflies in my stomach that only adventure can provide. That's why when my friend \"Zak\" called me and said he'd discovered a location on an unsealed sewer entrance to the Catacombs of Paris, I was all for it.\n\nIf you've never heard of this place or have only a brief acquaintance, the Paris catacombs are a gigantic underground network of tunnels and galleries that extend for about 300 kilometers under the city of Paris, France. The catacombs, originally built as quarries around the 18th century, were turned into public ossuaries in the late 18th century, and are currently visited by tourists as a historical and cultural attraction. The catacombs contain the remains of millions of Parisians who were moved there after the city's cemeteries closed.\n\nDue to their age and fragility, the catacombs have strict access rules to protect cultural heritage and the safety of visitors. In addition, the catacombs are a real underground labyrinth, it's not difficult to get lost in there. For these reasons, visits are highly regulated and controlled. Entering the Paris catacombs beyond the permitted areas for visitation was strictly prohibited, violating this rule could result in fines and other legal penalties.\n\nI should have stopped there but at that time all my rebellious mind had in my head was: everything forbidden tasted better.\n\nWe called another friend \"Sebastian\" and started planning everything. When are we going, what would we take and how would we not get lost. The last one was solved by Zak, we would use luminescent paints.\n\nAnd yes, when I look back I realize how stupid this all was from the start.\n\nI don't remember what lie I told my parents, but they believed it. And I was able to meet my two friends without any problem.\n\nEntering the catacombs of Paris through a secret entrance in the sewers was always going to be the adventure of a lifetime. I was very excited and looking forward to this adventure so different from the ones I've done before.\n\nZak led the way, he took us down to the sewer where the entrance to the Ossuary is said to be. It took us about twenty minutes to find that entrance, because Zak actually didn't know of a location at all, he just heard a rumor that there was an entrance here.\n\nThe entrance was narrow and dark, with only a shaft of light coming in through the crack at the top. Zak was the first to enter, followed by me and Sebastian. We managed to smell the strong and unpleasant smell of sewage in our nostrils, but that didn't stop us from moving forward.\n\nIt was then that we saw a steep staircase leading even deeper. We walked down the stairs cautiously, carefully watching each step we took. The sound of water running through the pipes echoed throughout the place. But that didn't bother me, after all, I was focused on finding something new.\n\nWe arrived in a huge underground room with dirty damp walls and a slippery floor. The flashlights we carried illuminated only a small part of the room, and the surrounding darkness made it even more frightening.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure if we were entering the Ossuary or if it was just one of the sewer corridors, but then our flashlight beams began to reveal a few bones here and there, until an entire walls adorned with bones and human skulls gave us a macabre welcome.\n\nAs we made our way deeper into the catacombs, the air grew stale and musty. The damp walls seemed to close in around us, and the darkness was all-consuming. But instead of feeling afraid, we feel like those brave youtubers with channels aimed at urban explorers who enter forbidden places like this. And that was amazing.\n\nThe Paris catacomb was an incredible gallery of macabre art. It was impossible to deny the morbid beauty of that place.\n\nThe walls were lined with stacked skulls and human bones, forming grotesque and frightening images. I couldn't help feeling that I was being watched through the hollow eyes of hundreds of skulls.\n\nI grabbed my cell phone and started filming around, capturing every detail of the historic structures, until an eerie sound echoed through the dark tunnels.\n\nEverything was silent, until Zak said \"Relax you pussies, it must have been just a car passing overhead\" He emphasized his statement by pointing to the ceiling above us.\n\nWe relaxed after that, Zak's words made sense. We were somewhere under the city, there couldn't be anything here, the sound could only have come from the surface.\n\nAs time went on, my earlier enthusiasm was turning into another feeling, which I refused to show to my friends, as I didn't want to tarnish my facade of a great and courageous adventurer. But I couldn't deny that little voice telling me something was wrong was getting louder.\n\nFilming Sebastian walking side by side to a wall full of piled up human bones as he said \"look at this!\" \"This is so cool!\" helped me to recover a little. Until then I noticed Zak enter a different corridor and move further and further away.\n\n\"Zak! Don't go wandering around aimlessly, you know it's easy to get lost around here!\" I shouted, but Zak just responded with his typical arrogance.\n\n\"Easy, Mom! I just want to take a look around these halls. Before you know I'll be back\"\n\nI rolled my eyes and continued filming Sebastian. I was used to Zak's habit of drifting away from the group and somehow never getting lost.\n\nIt was from that point on, that our adventure turned into a nightmare.\n\nSuddenly Zak screamed from one of the hallways, causing me and Sebastian to turn around in alarm.\n\nI shouted his name and shined the flashlight on all the corridors entrances nearby, but I couldn't find him. Then sounds like bones creaking and clinking echo through the galleries, making my blood run cold.\n\n\"Zak, this isn't funny you bastard!\" I yelled loud as I shined every entrances I could see, believing Zak was purposely trying to scare us.\n\nAnd then I realized that Sebastian was frozen, looking with eyes filled with utter terror in my direction, more specifically behind me. And then I heard a low, inhuman snarl.\n\nSlow and terrified I turned around. The flashlight shook in my hands, but I kept the grip as tight as I could to illuminate whatever was behind me.\n\nI had explored many unknown places in my life, I saw so many things, so many stories to tell, but never, never I had never seen anything like it before.\n\nBefore me was a creature that could only be described as something resembling a giant centipede made up mostly of several bones of various widths and thicknesses, and what appeared to be exposed tendons and muscles. In place of its head was a massive human skull with large, sharp teeth stained red whose origin I refused to believe.\n\nThat gigantic thing moved slowly with its many twisted legs towards us, staring at us with large empty eye sockets as it rose with the front part of its long body until it surpassed our height and almost touched the ceiling.\n\nFor a moment, we simply stared, unable to believe what we were seeing. Until the grotesque creature released a high-pitched, screeching sound that made us shiver to the bone.\n\nWe ran without looking back, trying to keep a strong and steady pace, following the luminous paint that Zak used to mark the way to the exit. But it was when we heard the creature heavy footsteps and its jaws grinding that the adrenaline took over our body.\n\nI dropped the backpack to get rid of the weight and Sebastian did the same. At some point in the panic I lost my flashlight and cell phone too, but at that moment material things didn't matter.\n\nMiraculously I managed to make my escape to the exit, but when I looked back to see if that monster was still following me, I realized with horror that Sebastian was no longer behind me.\n\nI headed back to the entryway again, even though all my instincts told me not to. I screamed Sebastian's name as loud as my lungs would allow, but the darkness only answered me with silence.\n\nThat experience changed me forever. I will never be the same fearless adventurer I was before. I managed to escape with my life, but the price I paid for my recklessness was high. I lost my best friends and now I live with this bitter and deserved guilt for the rest of my life."

Let's call her \"Emily.\" We hit it off immediately, and everything just felt right. We had similar interests, a great sense of humor, and honestly, I thought she was the one.\n\nFast forward a few months, and things got serious. One night, after a romantic date, we decided to take the plunge and have sex for the first time. It was both of our first times, and it felt special. I was over the moon.\n\nA few weeks later, my mom invited me to a family reunion that I hadn't been to in years. Emily and I had been talking about how we'd like to introduce each other to our families, so I thought it was a good opportunity. She agreed to come along, and we were both excited.\n\nSo, we arrive at the reunion, and I start introducing Emily to my relatives. Everything was going well until I introduced her to my uncle. The moment he saw Emily, his face turned pale. He pulled me aside and asked me where I met her. I explained, and he looked like he was about to faint. Turns out, Emily was his daughter. My uncle had been estranged from his wife and daughter for years, and I had no idea.\n\nI felt my stomach drop. Emily and I are cousins. I was in shock, and when I told Emily, she was equally horrified. We both sat down with my uncle, who confirmed everything. He showed us old photos, and there was no doubt about it.\n\nEmily and I decided to break up immediately. We were both devastated but knew it was the right thing to do. We haven't spoken much since, and family gatherings are awkward, to say the least.\n\nI still can't believe how things turned out. It's a nightmare I wouldn't wish on anyone. Thanks for reading, Reddit. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you cope?\n\n"

We had been together since high school, and it had been love at first sight. We married after graduation and had spent eighteen years together in wedded bliss. I worked as a writer, finding jobs in editing or column writing, Susan working as a receptionist for a friend of my mother. We spent a lot of time together, my days spent mostly waiting for her to come home. I lived for the moments when we were sitting in front of the TV together or curled together in bed as we talked about our day. We never had children, though it wasn’t for a lack of trying. I was afraid she would leave me when she discovered I was infertile, I’d been injured when I was small, but she just smiled and said we would just have to be satisfied with each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was never something we struggled with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of kids, we gave each other our full attention. We traveled as often as we could, ate out often, had date nights at least once a week, and loved each other more than anyone else we knew. Susan was my everything, and I hoped I was hers. She never gave me any doubt that it was so, and those eighteen years were the happiest times of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey weren’t enough, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA million years wouldn’t have been enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was writing something for some rag that Susan liked to read when I got the call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had looked over my shoulder that morning before she left, cooing appreciatively as I edited a piece from one of her favorite writers, other than me, of course. She wanted to read it when I was done, and I promised I would let her see it when she got home. I had been invited to write a column too, something they might let me do more often if it did well, and I had just started fleshing it out when I decided it was time for a second cup of coffee. The coffee maker was burbling happily, filling my mug with liquid happiness, when my phone rang. I thought it might be Susan, letting me know she had made it to work, and I almost didn’t answer when I saw it was an unknown number. The telemarketers had been particularly bad lately, and the last thing I wanted was another conversation with someone who wanted to sell me solar panels or extend the warranty on my car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurned out it was the police.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere had been an accident.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey were sorry, but she had passed very quickly, likely instantly, and hadn’t felt any pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cup smashed as it hit the floor, soaking my feet in hot coffee as I gripped the counter for support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would need support for the next few months. I was a wreck, my wife had been my whole world and now, suddenly, I was alone. I couldn’t even go into the bedroom for the first two weeks. It smelled like her, her pictures were everywhere, and I slept on the couch a lot on those days. I didn’t even go in there to get my suit. I just bought a new one off the rack for the funeral. It was small, and neither of us had a lot of friends or family, but the girls from the doctor's office were very supportive and very sorry to lose such a dear friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe buried her in Mountain Hills, a cemetery not far from the house, and after they lowered her into the ground, I just sat there, trying to figure out what to do now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was still sitting there when the guys from the funeral home came to pick up the chairs, the sun setting behind me as I watched the hole in the ground where my wife now lay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Sorry for your loss, Mr, but we’ve gotta pack these up now.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got up, drove home, and just sort of sat on the couch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the sun came up, I was still sitting there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis became a pattern. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next two months are kind of a blur, honestly. I lived my life like that quote from Forest Gump. When I was tired, I slept. When I was hungry, I ate. When I had to go, I went. I really didn’t leave the house unless I had to, and when I did, I walked. I didn’t trust cars after that, and I’m still not comfortable riding in anything with wheels. The walks probably did me good, but I was so lost at this point in my life. She had been my everything, my whole world, and I just didn’t know how to get by without her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t work, and my contracts quickly dried up. I wasn’t working on my books either and I had fallen into a deep funk. If something hadn’t pulled me out, I would have probably wasted away right there. Thankfully, something did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was when the gifts started showing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first one came on Valentine's Day, though I know now that was no accident. I had stepped out in the evening to check the mail, and there it was on the stoop. I almost stepped on it, and that would have been a shame because someone had left my favorites. Sitting there was a bouquet of wildflowers, a box of those dark chocolate truffles Susan had always bought me, and a card. I was stunned for a moment, not quite believing what I was seeing. This was just the sort of thing she would do, too, and I was expecting her to jump around the corner and surprise me. Susan hadn’t been very large, a wisp of a thing, but she liked to scare people and found it hilarious when she managed to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the minutes stretched by and no scare seemed incoming, I picked up the stuff and brought it inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put the flowers in some water, I had never gotten flowers before but I remembered that much, and set the chocolates on the table. I opened the card and found a pretty generic card, flipping it open to see who had sent it. I snorted as I read it, wondering whose bright idea this had been, but feeling a little better nonetheless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"From your secret admirer.\" was written inside, the handwriting fine and spidery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I ate the chocolates, I felt the tears come on unbidden. The taste, the smell, it all reminded me of Valentine's Days past. We would sit and watch a movie, curled up on the couch together, while she munched at her Ferrero Roches and I on my chocolate truffles. We’d trade sometimes, and I wished now that I could see her eyes light up as I handed her one of my chocolates again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI passed out on the couch a little later, but my dreams were a little brighter that night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I started finding other gifts. Food from my favorite Chinese place, candy, and books by writers that I liked. One time someone even delivered a seafood feast from Sir Crabbingtons, and I was halfway through it before I realized it was mine and Susan's wedding anniversary. I waited till after I had finished before crying this time, but the tears were still there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never questioned these gifts, but I never looked for them either. I assumed they were from friends or from the girls at the office she had worked at, but their dedication was heartwarming if it was. My wife must have talked about me a lot for them to know my favorite foods and snacks, and I was honestly just happy for a break from the sadness. Each of these gifts made my day a little better, and the pain ebbed away a little bit more with each new package. Suddenly I was writing again. Suddenly I had the energy to reach out to my old contacts and try to work again. I was running in the evenings, I was doing laundry and dishes, and I felt like I might be getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gifts were nice, but it was the other things that started to make me wonder if the gifts were all that was being given.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes, I would wake up to find that the clothes were folded or the dishes were done, and I couldn’t remember doing them. Other times it would be simpler things, things easily explained but no less odd. A blanket thrown across me where there hadn’t been before. A pillow under my head when I had slept on the couch and left it on the bed. Sometimes, as I came awake a little in the night, it seemed like I could see shadows moving in my house. I would sit up sometimes, the living room bathed in the light of whatever TV show I had fallen asleep watching, and look around for the source of the movement, finding nothing. It was weird, but I figured it was probably just my imagination. I had been through a lot lately, some mild hallucinations might be expected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was on one of my jogs when I finally discovered the identity of my secret admirer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was coming up the hallway, huffing a little from a longer walk than usual tonight, when I saw someone leaving something outside my door. I had to grab the wall for a minute when I first saw her because I thought it might be my wife. She was short, a little chubby, with brown hair cut short. She was dressed normally, jeans and a t-shirt, but the hightops were also something my wife had favored. From the back, she looked exactly like my dead wife, except for the hair. My wife had always talked about getting it cut short, but she favored ponytails and braids too much to cut it too short. She was bent at the waist, leaving food or something for me, and when I called her name she jumped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen she turned around, though, I could see I had been mistaken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman was similar to my wife, but her face was different. They could have still been sisters, but there were definitely subtle differences. Her nose was rounder, her face less angular, and she just seemed less substantial. I began to wonder if she might be a cousin or something, but I couldn’t think of anyone in Susan’s family who looked much like her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she said, looking embarrassed, “I guess you caught me. Sorry for being so mysterious, I just didn’t want to mess up your mourning. I was a friend of your wife’s, my name's Anne.” she offered me a hand to shake and I likely looked just as unsure of myself as I took it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her to knock next time, to come in and share a meal with me, and she agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat began our strange friendship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne was just the companion I needed, and we spent two to three nights a week in my living room. Some of you will lift your eyebrows at that, but it was never anything more than talk. Anne cried as often as I did, the two of us reminiscing over Susan and what she had meant to us. Anne, as it turned out, had known Susan far longer than I had. The two had been friends since they were children, and Anne told me about Susan’s early life in a way that made them sound like sisters. The more she told me, the more I wondered why I had never heard of her before? If Susan had known Anne since they were children, why was this the first time we were meeting? Many of her stories were things I had heard before, so they tracked, but any misgivings soon melted away as we spent our evenings remembering. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes, she held me while I cried, sometimes I held her, but it was nice to have someone there in my grief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had just gotten done with a particularly funny story about how Susan had cut her hair too short and given herself something like a mullet before shaving it down into a sloppy pixie cut when she suddenly began to cry. Her despair was deep, the sobs racking her, and when I moved to hold her, she pressed her face against my chest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said through blubbers, “but I just miss her so much.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI held her that night as she wept, and I think that was when I started to fall in love with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt made me feel terrible, but I couldn’t help it. She was so much like Susan, even her voice reminded me a little of my dead wife. I didn’t want to move on, I was still trying to process what to do next, but Anne helped a lot and I got the feeling that she didn’t mind being that person for me. Suddenly, she was coming over every night, bringing food or wine, and we spent our evenings together. It didn’t seem to bother her that I never wanted to leave the house, it didn’t make any difference to her that I didn’t cook, but the longer she was in my life, the more that changed. Suddenly, I was paying more attention to my clothes, I was taking on columns for online magazines and selling my short stories again. I was cooking dinners instead of eating takeout, and I felt as if I were getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne was a big supporter of this too, pushing me to get better, and that was when I started to notice that something was a little off about her, something I should have noticed before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne only came by after dark and was unavailable during the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne had a very demanding job but would change the subject anytime I brought it up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne would always leave before dawn, if not well before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnne wouldn’t stay at the house, wanting her own space, which I could respect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese things, on their own, didn’t seem so strange, but all together, they made me curious. I had also started wondering why Susan had never talked about Anne before. It was something that had always been at the back of my mind, but now it began to linger like a fishbone in my throat. If they were so close, why had I never met her? If they had been friends since childhood, why hadn’t she been at our wedding? Parties, trips, gatherings of people we had drawn around us, and Anne had never been at any of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked Anne about that one night, but she waved it off, telling me I must have seen her at those things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I’ve been to every gathering you guys have thrown. I was at your wedding, I was at the funeral, I’ve been with you guys all the way.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt made me think I was going crazy, but I couldn’t remember seeing her before that night two months ago. I thought about going through old pictures, but neither of us had ever been picture-taking people. We kept our memories inside, not on our phones, though it made it a little difficult to check now. I was hesitant to bring any of this up in front of her as well because I didn’t want her to feel like I was accusing her of anything. Anne had become very important to me, and I didn’t want to go back to sitting in my depression on the couch every night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is until I saw something I shouldn’t have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe’d been watching a movie on the couch, something Susan and I had seen a thousand times, and I had dozed off towards the end. I had laid my head over onto Anne, and if it bothered her, she gave no indication. I don’t know how long we sat like that, the two of us together on the couch, but when she got up to leave, I came half awake as I mumbled something about seeing her later. She didn’t respond, which I thought meant she hadn’t heard me, but as I opened my eyes a little, I saw something that froze me in my couch divet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA black shadow was standing in the doorway, it's back to me as it prepared to step out into the dim hallway. The creature looked like tar, its form more of a feminine insinuation than a fact. It must have had its back to me, but when I inhaled harshly and fell off the couch, it turned back to see what had happened. I was on the floor, breathing harshly and trying to find enough breath to scream, when the shadow creature bent down in front of me and spoke in Anne’s voice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“It’s okay, it’s okay. This wasn’t how I wanted you to find out, but I suppose it was inevitable.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn’t find my breath. I just looked at the thing that was speaking with Anne’s voice, trying to make sense of all this. What the hell was going on? In my head, I had wondered if Anne was some kind of stalker or a weirdo who was only pretending to know my wife, but this…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a little bit beyond anything I had thought about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What…what…”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe glanced at the sliding door to our apartment, noticing the sun beginning to peak up and sucking in air.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I don’t have time now, but please, listen. You have to trust that I would never hurt you, and I will explain what's going on. Some of the answers might not make a lot of sense, but I promise I’ll tell you what's going on. Just wait till tonight, till I get off, and I’ll tell you everything I can. Can you do that?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI nodded, and she returned it slowly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got up and walked towards the door, but turned back just before passing through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I’m still Anne, I’m still the person you’ve known for the past few months. Just keep that in mind.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen she walked through the door and left me sitting on the floor of my living room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a mess all that day. I didn’t understand anything. All I knew was that someone I’d grown pretty close to had turned into a featureless monster right before my eyes. I kept trying to convince myself throughout the day that it had all been a dream, that I was still dreaming, but the longer the day went on, the more I had to come to terms with the fact that it wasn’t. That meant that whatever it had been, it was coming back here tonight, and I would have to make a choice when it got here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid I let it in, or did I tell it to go away and lose Anne forever?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the knock finally came, night having crept up on me as I worried the day away, I looked out the peephole to see the same old Anne standing on my doorstep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I opened the door, she breathed a sigh of relief and asked if she could come in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI let her in, figuring that if the creature had wanted to hurt me, it would have done it before now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Okay,” she said, not sitting as she paced the living room, “I know you’ve probably got a ton of questions, but just let me tell you my side before you jump to conclusions.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe took a deep breath, steadying herself as she tried to find a place to begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I didn’t lie, I have been with your wife for a very long time. In fact, I’ve been with her since birth. Susan and I have gone everywhere together, right up until the day they buried her. I,” she paused, clearly not sure how to say it, “I’m Susan’s shadow.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI squinted at her, not really sure what to make of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“When your wife died, I was reassigned to someone else. Someone new, someone very new, but I still remembered you. I wondered how you were and what you were doing. I hoped you were doing okay, and as this little person napped and sat, I knew I had to go make sure you were okay. I had to stay with my new person during the day when shadows are the most noticeable, but at night I was free to roam a bit more. Babys don’t move as much as you might think, and with a seven o’clock bedtime, I was left with a lot of time to kill. I leave at five when the sun is coming up, and come back at night so I can see you.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe stopped, looking at me in an expectant way, but my mind was altogether unprepared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“So…you’re Susan’s shadow? How?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe shrugged, “Shadows are a part of people, but once they're dead, we aren’t really needed. I’ve been with Susan since the start, since the first time she met you, and I fell in love with you right alongside her. I had to know that you were safe, to know that you hadn’t given up, so I started to come back to our old house, and I found you suffering. So, I left you gifts to keep your spirit up, little things to make you realize you were still loved, but I got careless. I let myself get seen, but I guess that worked out in the end. Turned out, I was hurting too. I missed Susan, missed her more than I had any of the people I had been attached to before, and talking with you helped me get over her, just as it helped you. We helped each other, in the end, and that was what we both needed. We became what the other needed, and I’m thankful that you happened along and found me that day.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had questions, all kinds of questions, but the one that stuck seemed the most obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“If you have someone new that you’re attached to, does that mean that eventually you’ll have to go?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe nodded slowly, looking like she hoped I wouldn’t think of that right away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Eventually. As the person I’ve been assigned to grows, she will need me more than just during the day. I may have to stay with her more and more often at night, and that will ultimately mean less time with you. I want to be here for you, but I don’t want to stop you from moving on either. You need to get past her, to get past me, and eventually return to life as you knew it. You deserve that, you deserve to be happy.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt the tears leaking down my face, smearing her and turning her into a wavy half-person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Will you stay with me as long as you can?” I asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe nodded, smiling, “I will. I’d really like that.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was six months ago. The little girl she has become the shadow of, Anne, is starting to move around more, and Anne is happy with her progress. She doesn’t think it will be much longer before she’s walking, but she promises that she’ll still come and see me for a while to come. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“One day she may decide that the nights are for going out or working, but for now she’s still tossing in her crib before the sun goes down, and that's just fine with me.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t know how long I’ll have my Anne for, but I know it would never be long enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven as I write this, I know there will come a time when her visits become less and less, and I know that will be fine too.\n\nI had Susan for eighteen wonderful years, and I’ll take whatever time I have with her shadow as a gift. \n\n&#x200B;"

        "selftext": "\n\"Come on, Bobby. How come I always have to do it?\"\n\n\nClyde Arnet could hear the weight that his brother put against the pause button on the controller of his NES. The controller made that click sound that was somewhere between breaking and annoyed. It was the sound that let Clyde know that Bobby was just about done with his whining and would stop talking and start shouting. Bobby, for the most part, had been trying to be patient lately. He was dating some girl who was really into good Christian values and just being kind to people. Bobby was really trying to follow her example, but Clyde was, apparently, really good at pushing his buttons.\n\n\n\"Because, oh brother of mine, you need to toughen up, or this world is going to eat you alive.\"\n\n\nClyde felt a sudden burst of fear.\n\n\nBeing eaten alive was exactly why he was afraid to go downstairs and do what needed to be done. \n\n\nBobby laughed, \"Not literally, kiddo. I mean, like, if kids at school learn that my twelve-year-old brother is still afraid of the dark, they'd never let him live it down. He'd be a social outcast, unwelcome anywhere. I leave the job of turning off all the lights to you for that very reason.\"\n\n\nClyde looked at the open door as if he could already feel the eyes of the thing that hunted him and despaired.\n\n\nThe house they lived in had been his mother's childhood home. She had lived here with her two older sisters until she went off to follow their dad when he joined the Navy, a year before Bobby had been born. When Grandma had died suddenly, Dad having beat her into the grave by six months after a motorcycle accident, she had generously left the house to whichever daughter wanted it. His aunts had their own homes by that point, and the two-story home, free and clear with no leans on it, had seemed like a dream.\n\n\nThe first night they had been alone in the house, their mother having to work late most nights, she told them that before they went to bed, she expected all the lights to be off downstairs.\n\n\n\"I won't have my power bill up over the roof because you guys are trying to light the whole neighborhood.\"\n\n\nClyde had been assigned the task of turning off the lights before bed since that very night.\nThis task had been handed down by Bobby almost at once. He got away with this because A- he was the oldest and B- because mom worked five to six nights a week to pay for bills and taxes on the property. This meant that most nights it was just the two of them in the house, and Bobby was in charge when it was just the two of them. As such, Bobby usually gave Clyde the chores he didn't want, and that included turning off the lights.\n\n\n\"Come on, Bobby,\" Clyde tried again, but his brother wouldn't budge.\n\n\n\"Don't start, kid. You need to get over this, and the only way to do it is to do it, know what I mean?\"\n\n\nClyde didn't, but he nodded anyway.\n\n\nHe took the stairs like a palsied old man, watching as the downstairs got closer and closer as he came to the landing. \n\n\nHe switched the light off beside the stairs and began.\n\n\nThe lights, as it turned out, had to be turned off in a certain order. If you didn't turn off the stair lights first and the lights by the basement last, they would all come back on again. Neither of them understood why, but Clyde attributed it to the thing that lived in the dark after the lights went out. He had named it Mr. V for some reason, and even he didn't know why. He supposed he had to call it something, and that was as good a name for his nemesis as any. Bobby just thought it was some faulty wiring and told him that if he meant to get the job done then that's how it would have to be.\n\n\nYou could leave the stair light on, the ones on the stairs. In fact, it was advised so you could find your way back. Sometimes it was the best way to find your way back from the depths, and Clyde had used that light as a lighthouse more than once. He went into the foyer and turned the lights off, went to the mud room, and turned the lights off, but made sure to leave the porch light on so Mom could find the lock when she got home. Mr. V didn't care about the porch light, it seemed, and that was good because Mr. V could have a temper when he wanted to. \n\n\nThe first couple of nights, Bobby had gone with him. As long as Bobby was with him, nothing ever seemed to happen. The two went room to room before walking casually back to the stairs and up to their rooms. Whatever Mr. V was, he didn't bother big kids, or maybe it was just kids who didn't believe in him. Clyde didn't know, but it was always different when he was by himself. \n\n\nHe turned the lights off in the dining room slowly, finishing with the switch by the door so he could turn his back on the room and walk out. This was part of the game too, and it seemed to make it better if whatever it was didn't see you seeing it. Sometimes the dining room would be empty when he turned the light off, but sometimes he would see a figure standing in the dark space when he was done. Sometimes it was standing behind the chair at the head of the table, sometimes it was standing by the window, but it was always looking at him. It was never close, like the horror movies he and Bobby sometimes watched when mom worked late. It was never just right in front of him, ready to grab him when the lights went off, but it was still closer than he would have liked.\n\n\nAs he walked towards the living room, he could almost feel the eyes of Mr. V on his neck, and it made him shudder.\n\n\nClyde looked at the leather couch that his mother had brought from the apartment, her only addition to her mother's furniture, and felt a pang of guilt as he looked at the scratches across the leather. That hadn't been his fault, not really, but he had caused it. The pastor at church said that people had to take accountability for their actions, and Clyde was man enough to admit that this had been his fault. He had broken the rules, and he had to pay the price.\n\n\nIt had all started very subtly. He would notice little things once the lights went out, and he would make note of them for later. The shadow man was one, a thing he thought of as Mr. V. Then there was the way the shadows lengthened and twisted sometimes when the lights were off. The whole downstairs took on a kind of puffy, unreal look after dark, and he had seen it swell or shrink depending on its wants. He still wasn't really afraid of Mr. V, still didn't really believe in him, but he was afraid of the dark, and that made it easy to tell yourself that anything could be living in it.\n\n\nEven this mysterious Mr. V.\n\n\nHe had spent weeks running up the stairs as he fled the kitchen for the living room. He had never felt anything grab at his ankles or claw at his shirt, but it had always felt like a close thing. The week before the incident had been a bad one. He had felt a sense of foreboding hanging over the dark rooms, and it was making its way into his dreams. Sometimes when he dreamed, he would run through endless corridors, the shadow man chasing him as he fled. It was weird to be on the cusp of eleven and feel like you might be on the verge of having a breakdown, but Clyde was getting there. He had tried to explain it to his mom, but she just said that Bobby was in charge, and it sounded like he was trying to help him. Bobby was relentless when it came to ridding his brother of his fear of the dark. He told him how the other kids would pick on him if he went into middle school with his fear, how no one would want to be his friend, and that hadn't helped his anxiety either.\n\n\nThat night, when he'd come downstairs, Bobby was already asleep and Clyde really didn't want to turn off the lights alone. He had turned off the lights in the foyer with a shaky hand, but then he had seen the shadow man, Mr. V, lurking by the front door and his legs had started to shake. The man was looking at him, staring into him with his nonexistent eyes, and as he watched, Clyde realized he was backing up. He was slowly backing up, making his way towards the stairs, and when he dashed up them, he closed the door to his room and locked the knob. He climbed into bed and covered up, closing his eyes tight as he heard something terrible happening downstairs. Crashing, bashing, furniture being turned over, and all of it because he had been too scared to turn off the lights.\n\n\nHis mother had woken them up when she got in, yelling for them to get downstairs.\n\n\nClyde had still been awake and had suspected what they would find.\n\n\n\"What the hell did you guys do? All the lights are on, the house is destroyed, I want some answers!\"\n\n\nAs the two looked over the destruction, they saw she wasn't wrong. Neither of them could come up with a good enough explanation, and their mother had set them to clean it up as she got ready for bed. The house looked like a tornado had been through it. Books were thrown off shelves, the couch was cut and ripped, the end table was turned over, and the whole room was just an unholy mess. Bobby had complained about it, even cornering his brother after Mom had gone to bed and asking him why he had trashed the house? He hadn't been awake to hear the destruction, but Clyde had. He knew he hadn't done this, and he knew Bobby hadn't done it, so unless his mom had come home early to trash the house, it had to be Mr. V.\n\n\nAfter that, Clyde had been more diligent about getting the lights off, and as long as he pretended not to see Mr. V, he never bothered him.\n\n\nHe shut the lights off in the living room now, the mended slash lost in the dark and headed for the kitchen. The dishes were in the drying rack, the sink gleaming after Bobby had wiped it out, and the chairs were all pushed in around the table. Clyde turned to look, marking his escape route in his mind as he prepared to make a run for it, and shuddered as he saw the dark head peeking out from the door to the den. It was waiting for him, waiting for him to turn the lights off, and when his hand shook as his finger hovered over the switch, Clyde hoped he had the strength to do it again.\n\n\nHe pulled it down and immediately took off. \n\n\nHe heard something come out of the den, but he was already running through the door to the living room. He bumped something with his hip as he passed by the couch, slowing him a little as he made for the stairs. It wasn't the first time he had bumped something, but it wasn't the pain that had slowed him. The side of the china cabinet had felt like Play-Doh, not quite solid, and it only reminded him that once the lights were out, it was different down here.\n\n\nWhen the lights were on, this was where he and Bobby sat and watched cartoons or MTV after school.\n\n\nWhen the lights were on, this was where he and his mom sat on the couch on Sundays and watched Lifetime.\n\n\nWhen the lights were off, however, the landscape was something else, a place that he had no control over.\n\n\nHe could see the stairs, the light casting long fingers down into the dark, but as he got close, his greatest fear was realized.\n\n\nUntil then, he could tell himself that it was all in his head. He could tell himself that this was just his imagination playing tricks on him and that it would pass once he was Bobby's age. Clyde could come up with a thousand excuses for his fear when he was safe in his bed, and the monster was downstairs, but as something grabbed his leg, Clyde knew that the excuses were nothing but a paper shield.\n\n\nThe thing that grabbed his leg wasn't a hole beneath the couch or a toy that had been left out. \n\n\nThe grip was iron, the claws were sharp, and when he turned back to look, Clyde wished he hadn't. \n\n\nThe sight of that pitch-black face undulating in the semi-darkness of his living room was the most terrifying thing he had ever seen. The mouth was full of gnashing teeth, the eyes were like spiral circles drawn by an uncreative child, and Clyde screamed in terror as he kicked at the thing with his free leg. It took the first kick between the eyes, but the second made the grip loosen some, and the third finally found him able to yank his leg free. He felt the claws scratch across his flesh, leaving four long marks, but Clyde didn't care. \n\n\nClyde was running up the stairs on all fours, and when he came to the top, he looked down and saw the thing sitting at the bottom of the stairs, looking at him. IT didn’t seem to care that it hadn’t caught him, it didn’t seem to care that he had escaped. The look in those black on black eyes, let him know that, eventually, it would get him.\n\n\nTomorrow was another day. \n\n\n“What happened?”\n\n\nClyde turned, cowered as a new figure rose up from the dark hallway.\n\n\nHe screamed again, sure he was about to die, and Clyde almost cried when he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Bobby asked.\n\n\nClyde tried to tell him, but he couldn't properly articulate what he had experienced.\n\n\nIt remained one of the scariest events in his life."

        "selftext": "\nIt all started with the John Doe.\n\n\nHe had come in by ambulance at about midnight on Christmas Eve after being found in an alley by a patrolman. He got there before I did, and sat there for most of the day, just taking up a slab. I remember feeling sorry for the corpse. Was there someone out there wondering where he was and why he had never come home? The police were baffled and no one was really sure who he was or how he died. Poison was suspected, but the coroner wasn’t in that day and we were really just minding the shop until he came back on the twenty-sixth. I was mostly just trying to make it till six pm so that I could sign off to the night receptionist and head home. It was Christmas Eve and I really wanted to get home, put my pj's on, and enjoy my evening.\n\n\nWe only had one visitor that day, and he was easily the strangest person I'd ever seen.  \n\n\nHe came bustling in around noon, a middle-aged guy in dark clothes, and an honest God traveling cloak. When I saw him, I thought to myself that there must be some kind of Harry Potter thing going on in town. The guy looked like an extra in one of the movies, and not one of the extras you want to get to know. The guy just screamed \"Death Eater\" at the top of his lungs, and when he saw me, he made a beeline for the desk as he flashed his best shark's grin. \n\n\nThe eyes that hung above that smile, however, were the most intense eyes I had ever seen.\n\n\nThey looked like pools of green that danced like a lake full of ice.\n\n\nA lake that held monsters beneath the surface.\n\n\n“Excuse me, Miss. I’m wondering if you’ve had any John Does come in today?”\n\n\nI told him I’d be happy to take a look and asked him if he could tell me anything about the body he was looking for.\n\n\n“Oh, late thirties, dark hair, probably dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt. “\n\n\nI was instantly suspicious because it sounded like he was describing the body I had been wondering about all day. I asked for ID and proof of his relationship to the deceased, but he seemed unable to produce either. He said his brother hadn't come home last night and someone had told him about the police taking a body that had been found near their apartment, which had brought him here to check on it.\n\n\n\"I hope it's not him, but I just can't stand to see our poor mother worry over him.\"\n\n\nThe unfaltering grin he wore made me believe otherwise, but I told him that without proof of relation to the deceased, he couldn't view the body. I advised that he come back with a photo ID and identification for the body, perhaps a police report, and then we could do a proper ID on the John Doe. He smiled the whole time, but I didn't really trust that grin. He had expected to just waltz in and do whatever he meant to do, probably snap some pictures for a local tabloid or something, while the morgue was short-staffed for the holidays, but I wasn't about to play along. \n\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"I should have come better prepared. I'll go home and see what I can scrounge up.\"\n\n\nHe left, and I figured I'd never see him again.\n\n\nI wish that had been the case.\n\n\nThe strange man came in around noon, but as I settled in to kill the second half of my day, something pinged on my camera around back. The morgue in our town isn't huge. A dozen pull drawers, of which about half are usually occupied, a freezer for long-term storage that holds about three or four cadavers at any given time, and three autopsy tables. Most of our business comes in through the rear, ambulances or herses from the local funeral homes, and the back door camera has a motion sensor so I can tell when one of them pulls up to pick up or drop off.\n\n\nI wheeled over to the little CCTV monitor near the end of my desk and pushed the silence button as I checked the feed.\n\n\nI had expected to find an ambulance with another drop-off, but instead, I was greeted by an empty alley on the grainy monitor. The cameras were old, the feed full of snow and off-color pictures, but with daylight still holding sway it was easy to see that nothing was out back but the dumpster we used for garbage. I figured it must have been a bird or something, and went back to playing on my phone.\n\n\nWhen it chirped again, I glanced over just in time to see a shadow step out of frame. \n\n\nA shadow with a cape, or maybe a long cloak.\n\n\nI leaned in and looked at the grainy feed, trying to see where the shadow had gone, but there was nothing. Whatever had set the camera off had stepped out of sight, and I wondered if it might be a bum or something. We did, occasionally get vagrants in the alley, but most of them weren't in a big hurry to hang out around the morgue. Most of them knew that lingering in the pull-in lane would get you yelled at by emergency services, and the rest were just afraid of what they might catch from the dumpster since it was clearly where we disposed of the spare bodies (har har).\n\n\nSeeing the shadow, however, made me think about our mysterious visitor, and I clicked around on the camera to the other four views we had.\n\n\nThe cold room was clear.\n\n\nThe autopsy room was clear.\n\n\nThe back hall was clear.\n\n\nThe front room was clear, except for me.\n\n\nThe movement sensor went off again then, scaring the tar out of me, and when I flipped over to the back alley I saw an ambulance pulling into the narrow alley.\n\n\nI sighed, getting up as I went to lock the front door and open the back door for them.\n\n\nI hate it when they don't call first, but that's the nature of the business.\n\n\nRalph was there, the guy who usually drives the bus from St Michaels, with a couple of car crash victims who had died en route to the hospital.\n\n\n\"They said the families will be by the pick the bodies up tomorrow. What a Christmas, huh? Sign here.\"\n\n\nI signed off on his clipboard and the EMTs loaded the bodies into the freezer drawers in the autopsy room. They were pretty banged up, but I had little doubt that whatever mortuary they sent them to would put them back together in time for the funeral. It would either be Gladys or McMans if they were locals, and both did excellent work for the price tag. I stuck around to chit-chat with Ralph for a few minutes as he smoked, and as the ambulance rolled out of the alley, I remembered the mysterious shadow and had a look around to see if something was still hanging around.\n\n\nThe alley was empty, other than the dumpster and the trash cans, and there was nothing that could have made the shadow in the first place.\n\n\nI headed back inside, having killed an hour at least watching them unload a couple of stiffs, and returned to find a surprise.\n\n\nTwo missed calls and a voicemail from a number I wasn't familiar with.\n\n\nThe voicemail turned out to be from someone named Candace, and she sounded scared despite the upbeat holiday music playing in the background.\n\n\nI called her back, and she asked me to wait a moment as she stepped outside.\n\n\n\"Yes, hi, my name is Candace Guizeman. My fiance' never came home last night and,\" she sobbed audibly before regaining her composure, \"I was wondering if maybe you’d had a John Doe come in recently.”\n\n\nI told her we had, telling her about the man who’d been brought in last night, and I heard her make a heart-wrenching sound as I described him. She said it might be a few days before she could come and identify the body, something about needing someone to watch her children, and asked if we could please hold the body until she could come and have a look. I explained to her that the coroner wouldn’t be back until the twenty-sixth, and the body would likely go into long-term storage after tonight anyway. She said she would be there on the twenty-sixth when we opened, and thanked me for being so understanding. \n\n\n“This is just going to devastate the kids if it’s him. They really loved Terry so so much, especially after the hell their real father put them through.”\n\n\nShe hung up, and I remember hoping maybe it wasn’t him.\n\n\nNobody wants to find out their new stepdad is dead on Christmas.\n\n\nFor the rest of the day, I kept catching strange blips on the camera. I would look up from my phone and see odd movements on the hallway cams or quick and agitated motions from the back area cameras. It was like a moth, or something was catching the lens, and more than once I thought about going to have a look. It was like being the night guard on a Five Nights at Freddy’s game, and the parallels were beginning to spook me as the day progressed slowly.\n\n\nAt four, after glancing up half a dozen times to find nothing, I finally went and searched the back for whatever was making the cameras wig out. The back hallway was clear, the emergency lights casting the linoleum in a sickly green color. The back door was locked, the shadows gathering in the back alley as I looked through the back window. The cold storage door was locked, but I opened it anyway and took a peek inside, finding nothing but closed drawers and a lot of condensation.\n\n\nMy last stop was the short-stay room, and I found the door still locked as I opened it to take a peek.\n\n\nAll the drawers were pushed in, all the tables were still clean, and nothing seemed amiss.\n\n\nI didn’t find any bugs or wildlife that had gotten in when the back door was open and was forced to return to my desk and wait out the last hour and a half of my shift.\n\n\nFifteen minutes later, I looked up and nearly screamed at what I saw on the monitor.\n\n\nThe monitor in the autopsy room had detected movement, and I looked up to find a familiar man standing over one of the drawers. The body of our John Doe was lying placidly under his watchful eye, and he reached out the stroke the cheek almost tenderly. I watched as he looked up and into the camera as if he could see me. He grinned, raising his hand to wave at me, and that’s when I brought my shaky hand down on the big red button that locked the door between the back room and the front area. I’ve never had to use it, but I had heard it was installed after some weirdos tried to sneak into the morgue. The maglocks would keep just about anyone without super strength from getting back there, and they would engage the locks on the back door as well.\n\n\nI called the police, and I must’ve sounded pretty frantic because they came immediately. The guy had finished whatever business he had with the John Doe and moved out of range of the cameras. I hadn’t seen him for close to ten minutes by the time the police got there, and the three uniformed officers told me to stay back as they went through the door once I disengaged the button.\n\n\nThey told me to re engage it after they had gone through, and the fifteen minutes I stood waiting for them to come back was agonizing. I could just imagine this guy getting the jump on them and somehow getting back out to me. He was weird enough to want to mess around with dead bodies. I shuddered to think what he would do to me and the police officers if given the opportunity. \n\n\nWhen someone knocked three times on the door to the morgue hallway, I jumped and quavered out to ask who was there.\n\n\n“It’s Officer Mathers, ma’am. We are ready to come out now,”\n\n\nI asked if they had found the man, and they said I must have been seeing things, because there was no one back there.\n\n\nI opened the door, after looking through the little window to verify who they were, and all three were more than happy to take me through each room and show me that there was no one there. I told them about the man who would come in earlier, the creepy guy who was wondering about the John Doe we had, and they took the description. Despite this, I don’t think they took me seriously. They said if I saw him again to give them a call, but that they had found no signs of forced entry, and no signs of anyone having been back there at all.\n\n\n“Even the drawer that you reported opened was closed. Nothing disturbed or out of place, last as far as we could tell.” Officer Mathers added.\n\n\nLuckily for me, my relief came in about that time because I don’t think I could’ve stood to be there for another second.\n\n\nI told them what happened, even called my boss to tell them what had happened, and went home to try and relax and enjoy my Christmas Eve.\n\n\nI’d like to say that was the end of it, but the real horror was to come the next day.\n\n\nI was woken up at about eight o’clock the next morning by a phone call from the police.\n\n\nThey were sending a car to come pick me up from my apartment, and they had some questions they needed answered right away. The officer on the phone was being extremely cagey, and if he hadn’t started out by giving me his badge number, I would’ve probably thought it was a crank call. He assured me that it was very serious and that if I didn’t agree to come down to the station I might find myself compelled to do so. So, I got dressed and was indeed picked up by a police car and taken to the local precinct. I was put into a meeting with Detective Ruckers and asked about the nature of my call to the police the day before.\n\n\nI told him the truth. I told him I had seen someone in the morgue area and called the police after locking down the building. Police had come, but they hadn’t found anything. I suspected that it was the weirdo who had come in earlier that day, and I gave the detective his description. The detective was very interested in the details of the weird guy I had seen, since now the case of the John Doe had taken a very strange turn.\n\n\n“How could that be?” I asked, “He’s been locked in a drawer since they brought him in yesterday”\n\n\nDetective Ruckers gave me a look that told me he was trying not to give me more information than I needed, but before leaving, he finally decided to throw me a bone.\n\n\n“I’m afraid someone took him at some point yesterday and did something pretty terrible with him.”\n\n\nI asked him what happened, my curiosity piqued, but he said he couldn’t share details of an ongoing investigation with someone who might be involved.\n\n\n“We'll call you if we have any more questions, but I should tell you that you are a person of interest, and probably shouldn’t leave town for the next few days.”\n\n\nI walked out of the precinct utterly confused.\n\n\nWhat the hell happened?\n\n\nTurned out I wouldn’t have to wait very long for answers.\n\n\nThe police were tight-lipped about the incident, but the news was less vague about the details.\n\n\nIt appeared that on December twenty-fifth at around four in the morning, someone had broken into the Guzman home. Mrs. Guzman, the woman I had talked to the day before, had called the police and went to lock herself into her children’s bedroom with them. She had no sooner left her bedroom than she heard the screams of her children from the living room. She was afraid that the intruder had done something to them and went charging into the living room to save them.\n\n\nWhat she found were her children cowering before the Christmas tree, and the body of her fiancé, Terry Rustle, sitting in the armchair he had loved so much in life. Police had arrived, but it appeared that no one had forced their way in at all. The police said it looked like Mr. Russell had simply fallen out of the sky into his favorite armchair just to give his family the worst Christmas surprise of their life. \n\n\nThey interviewed Mrs. Guzman, and she told the reporter that her husband had been responsible for these things. It was pretty clear that the police and the reporter had been trying to get her off camera, but Mrs. Guzman was adamant that these facts had to be disseminated. I wondered why they hadn’t cut the interview, but I suppose it made the story even more sensational when you thought about it.\n\n\nA distraught fiancé, talking about her vindictive ex-husband after finding the body of her new love in her home on Christmas morning probably boosted their ratings for the whole year.\n\n\n“It was Martinez, I know it. He left my Terry there for me to find to remind me not to think I was safe. You have to protect me, someone has to find him, as long as he’s out there this will never stop. He filled him with presents, like some strange Santa Claus sack. He filled him up after he killed him and left him there for me to find. He left him there. He left him there. He left him there!”\n\n\nAfter that, I had to have answers. \n\n\nWe didn’t get the body of Terry Russell when it was released by the investigators. They were probably afraid we would lose it again. I never got a chance to look at the report of what had been done to him, but I wasn’t without means. A friend of mine, who works for the police department in my town, agreed to have drinks with me. After some pleasantries, he told me all the details that were too gory for TV. \n\n\nHe told me how the body had been stuffed with cheap gifts that were wrapped in what appeared to be the divorce papers Mrs. Guzman had sent to her ex-husband.\n\n\n“Most of us knew Mrs. Guzman already. We’ve been called out by the neighbors quite a few times for well checks or domestic violence claims. She never implicated Mr. Guzman, but the bruises we found on her and the kids made it pretty clear that the man had a temper.”\n\n\nI asked my friend about Mr. Guzman, about what he looked like and how he seemed to them, and he had a lot more to say about the woman’s husband than the woman.\n\n\n“The guy was a kook. He always dressed like some kind of wizard, with fancy clothes and fancy capes, and always had this look about him. I don’t know how to describe it if you’ve never seen it, but I deal with guys who make a lot of outrageous claims about what they can and can’t do. You deal with guys all the time. They tell you they’re gonna kill you where you stand, or how they’re gonna break both your arms and snap your neck the second you lay a hand on them. Most of those guys are full of crap, but Martinez Guzman was the first guy I believed could actually do it. He wasn’t a huge guy, but the look in his eyes made me think he was capable of violence, and that maybe he was capable of other things, too.”\n\n\nHe told me that Martinez Guzman had been nowhere to be found when they arrived, if he had ever been there to start with, but the body of Terry Russell had been seated in the chair just as Mrs. Guzman had said it would be.\n\n\n“There was no sign of forced entry, just like it said on the news, and it was like he had just dropped out of the sky right into that chair. We searched the house first, not figuring her finance was going anywhere, but once we got back to the living room, we saw something out of place. There were things on the floor in front of him, things wrapped in paper that was discolored. They just kept falling to the floor as we came back into the living room, and we didn't really understand what they were until we came around the chair. It was,” He paused for a moment and took a long pull off his drink, “ it was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. His belly had just opened up as if someone had drawn a zipper, and there were all these little paper packages lying on the ground. They were cheap things, little toys and costume jewelry, and they were all wrapped up in legal papers. We didn’t even know they were divorce papers until we got them back to have them analyzed. That was when we started really looking at Martinez. The papers were from a packet his wife's lawyer had mailed to him, and they weren't something just anyone could have gotten a hold of. It was like the son of a bitch had wrapped up all these presents for them to open and then just put them in her fiancé. Then he had turned the man loose to just walk home and deliver them.”\n\n\nI asked him how the presents had gotten in there since we hadn’t even autopsied the man and he gave me this strangely mystic look.\n\n\n“That’s the thing, there were no cuts on him. There were no incisions, no stitches, no staples. There was nothing. It was as if things had just appeared inside of him fully wrapped, and then he had taken them home for delivery.”\n\n\nHe took another long drink, and when he sat the glass down, he raised his hand at the barkeep to get another one.\n\n\n“I’ve seen some weird shit on the force, you remember that alligator we found in the sewer and those girls that went missing who just randomly appeared in the cornfield last year, but this is beyond even me. I don’t understand it, but I believe Mrs. Guzman when she tells me that her husband is some kind of magic man. She talked about it constantly when she was at the station. She talked about how she and her kids needed protection, how they needed to disappear, how they needed to go somewhere Martinez would never find them. She was adamant about it, and most of the guys at the station think she's a nut. Looking at that and remembering the way his eyes looked anytime we would interview him, I don’t think she’s a nut. I think she got mixed up with something bad and I think if we don’t make her disappear, then we’ll find her and those kids dead someday.”\n\n\nHe finished his drink in one long slurp and then excused himself, saying he needed to get some air.\n\n\nThat was a couple of weeks ago, and the media has finally forgotten about the strange present Mrs. Guzman and her children were delivered Christmas morning.\n\n\nThey may have, but I haven’t.\n\n\nThere’s nothing I can do about it, except give out the description of Martinez Guzman, and hope that if anyone sees him they’ll know to stay away from him.\n\n\nHe’s a man in his early forties, Hispanic, with short dark hair and the most intense emerald green eyes I’ve ever seen. He was wearing strange clothes, like a costume from a Harry Potter movie, and when he spoke, it felt like spiders running up my spine.\n\n\nI don’t recommend that you approach him. I don’t recommend that you attempt to apprehend him. For the love of God, I don’t recommend that you get to know him at all.\n\n\nAs Mrs. Guzman could attest, his presents are far from what’s on anyone's Christmas list"

        "selftext": " \n\nConsider yourself lucky if you’ve never been woken up by a tornado alarm. One minute, you’re in a deep sleep, dreaming about a better world, and the next, you’re being confronted with a waking nightmare. When those alarms go off, you only have a few minutes to wake from your stupor, gather your family, and get to a safe space. The twister could be down the street or across town – you won’t know until it either blows your house down or enough time passes that you feel confident it missed you. In the meantime, you and yours huddle in a closet or a cellar and pray.\n\nIt’s a hazard I’ve lived with for most of my life. When you grow up in a part of the country colorfully named “Tornado Alley,” you learn to live with the storms. I’ve been lucky that one hasn’t destroyed my house, but I’ve had a few close shaves. If you’ve ever seen the power of a massive funnel cloud up close, it never leaves your brain. Watching the natural world destroy nearly indestructible buildings is a fun reminder that Mother Nature is our landlord and people are just the residents on this planet. We can be evicted at any moment.\n\nThe screeching alarms are as much a part of summer as the crack of a bat and the buzzing of cicadas. They help make up the milieu of Midwest living. The alarm systems are automated, and they go off when conditions indicate a potential storm. Even if there isn’t a twister, the alarms are a signal that something terrible is approaching. It could be a pounding hail storm, a weird green sky, or flooding from intense and ceaseless rainfall. Regardless, if the alarms are blaring, some bad shit is coming your way.\n\nThis time was worse than all those other times combined.\n\nMy day had been a pleasant one. The weather was warm, so we spent the day playing in the yard and taking a dip in our pool. It’s an above-ground number that we got at a discount, but the water was cool, and that’s all that mattered. My littlest is still learning, and my oldest loves to jump in, so it was a balancing act trying to get both sides to work together. It can be frustrating, but these micro-negotiations were the purview of parenting. Comes with the turf.\n\nAs afternoon turned into evening, Cindy, my wife, played soccer with the kids while I cooked some burgers on the grill and enjoyed a drink or two. The weather was so perfect we ate outside under our spreading oak tree. My son left his scraps “for the ants,” and I was sure the amount of food he left would fill the ant's storage quota for the summer. After the sun went down and we put the kids to bed, Cindy and I lay in our hammock, watching the stars and talking about nothing and everything.\n\nIt’s an odd way to think about it, but it was one of those days you’ll think about on your deathbed. A moment in time you’ll lovingly return to when you’re about to cross into the next life. It’ll bring a smile to your face at a time when that should seem impossible.\n\nWe went to bed a few hours later. The temperature had cooled, and there was a slight breeze blowing. Still, there was absolutely no indication of storms on the horizon. When you’re in an area where it rains frequently, you can develop a sixth sense of when a storm is coming. You can feel subtle changes in your body. If a distant storm is intense enough, you can smell the petrichor in the air. The smell of dried dirt mingling with rainwater lets you know what kind of hell is coming.\n\nBut there was none of that. We slept with everything as calm as possible in this roiling modern world. The perfect capstone to the perfect day. One for the ages.\n\nThen the tornado sirens started blaring.\n\nWhen you become a parent, any thought of being a deep sleeper goes out the window. Nature takes away your ability to sleep deeply when you have to take care of little ones. That said, the alarm was loud enough to wake the dead. I sat up in an instant, my eyes open, but the fuzz of the dream world still clouded the edges of my vision.\n\n“Tornado?” Cindy asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.\n\n“I think so. I’ll grab the kids,” I said, swinging my legs out of bed. Before I could hit the door, I heard the running of two little bodies down the hallway. The sirens had also brought the kids in from the land of nod. They both were scared, and you could see the fear in their tiny faces. They both ran past me and hopped under the blankets with my wife.\n\nI grabbed my phone and looked for an alert from the national weather service, but there was nothing. I did a Google search for tornado warnings in my area and came up with the same. I hauled my body out of bed and walked to the back slider. I didn’t see any rain falling. I opened the door and confirmed there wasn’t even the distant rumble of thunder.\n\nBut that alarm was steady. It would rise in tone and decibels and then fall again before starting over. If you listened closely, you could hear the different alarms going off further away. It was like they were singing the world’s most annoying song in the round.\n\nI closed the door and walked back into my bedroom. Cindy was getting the gear ready to go into our shelter when I said to stop. She was confused.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“There isn’t any storm.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, “There are some scattered clouds, but they’re not thunderheads or anything.”\n\n“But the alarms?” she said.\n\n“Maybe it’s a malfunction?”\n\n“I hope not, seeing as working tornado alarms are important.”\n\n“I know,” I said, “but there isn’t even a stiff breeze right now. It’s just like it was when we came inside last night. Still and cool but calm.”\n\n“Should we go to the shelter for a little bit, just in case something is forming and we can’t see it?”\n\nI thought about it, and it wasn’t a bad idea. Yes, the kids would have their night interrupted and would have a hard time falling back to sleep. Yes, that lack of sleep might also make them little goblins in the morning. Yes, I was probably being overly cautious. But the downside of being wrong could be death. That was worse than kids being grumpy in the morning.\n\nI agreed and sent them down into the shelter to wait it out but decided to stay upstairs for now. Our phones worked for shit in the shelter under the house. If I was going to find any new information, I would have to stay above ground for the time being.\n\nI helped everyone downstairs and closed up the shelter. I promised Cindy and kids I’d join them if things went sideways. I wouldn’t dawdle or try to get a good video – I tend to do so. I would be under the house as fast as they could say “tornado.”\n\n“If you linger, I’ll come grab your ass, storm or no storm.”\n\n“Trust me, I know,” I said, giving her a kiss on the forehead.\n\nOnce my family was safely under the house, I went out to my porch. The alarms were still blaring, and it was obvious that my family wasn’t the only one awake. Down the darkened street, I could see the porch lights pop on like man-made lightning bugs.\n\n“What the hell is this?” I heard someone say in the yard next to me. It was my neighbor Rick. Despite being on the tail end of the Boomer generation, Rick seemed to swim against the tide. He was more rooted in Gen X than anything. Whenever we would shoot the shit outside, he’d constantly complain about the “old people” in our town as if he was blind to his own receding hairline and wrinkles.\n\n“Busted alarm?” I offered.\n\n“What?” He yelled. I moved closer to him to avoid hollering into the night.\n\n“Maybe a busted alarm? Or someone accidentally scheduled a test for three AM instead of PM.”\n\n“I dunno, those tests are all controlled by computers. I don’t think they’d make that kind of mistake. Besides, they would’ve shut them down by now if it was an accident.”\n\n“There are some clouds up there. Think a storm is brewing?”\n\n“Not according to the Weather Birds,” Rick said. The “Weather Birds” were a local group of weather nerds and storm chasers he belonged to. There isn’t much to do where we live, so you find hobbies wherever possible. “They said a good cell was hanging out in North Texas, but it wasn’t coming this way.”\n\n“I wonder what gives,” I said.\n\n“Government,” said a voice to my right. This was my other neighbor, John. John was very much a Boomer and proud of it. He was a former Marine and hated everything about modern living. As you can imagine, any of my kid’s toys that ended up on his lawn, he instantly seized until I went and asked nicely for it. Every time, he’d lecture me, and I would apologize until he gave my kid’s frisbee or whatever. He was exhausting.\n\n“I mean, the weather alert system *is* run by the government,” Rick said.\n\n“Deep state government, Rick. The bad guys,” John said with a sneer. “They’re up to something.”\n\n“Their master plan includes setting off a false tornado alarm in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere?” I asked.\n\n“One, this isn’t the middle of nowhere. Breadbasket of the country and home to several nuclear missile launch sites,” John barked, “two, the alarms are a way to set us off balance. To confuse us. If we’re focusing on the alarms, we’re not watching what they’re really doing.”\n\n“Which is?” Rick asked in a mix of confusion and amusement.\n\n“Land clearance. They’ll drive us out of here and reclaim our land.”\n\n“Why would they do that?” I asked.\n\nJohn just laughed. “Boy, you just don’t get it, do you? Your whole generation is out to lunch.”\n\n“Actually, my whole generation has to work through our lunch breaks,” I said, unable to resist the dig.\n\n“They want to build a reeducation center here. Turn real patriots into brain-dead automatons that’ll do whatever they tell us to do. Then the government can control us... that’s when it gets really interesting.”\n\n“Where did you hear that?” Rick asked.\n\n“I do my own research,” John said defensively.\n\n“Wait, you’re *against* government control now?” Rick asked, doubling down.\n\n“Always have been,” he snapped.\n\n“Didn’t you work on the campaign for the ultraconservative guy that ran in our district? The one that wanted to ban immigration and create a ‘Muslim directory’?” I asked, knowing the answer already.\n\n“Oh yeah,” Rick chimed in, “the anti-gay, anti-trans guy. Clay...something….”\n\n“Stonewater...and he’s not anti-trans,” John hissed, “he’s just a *traditionalist.* And those things have nothing in common with the kind of government control I’m talking about. The one that will strip normal people of their rights! Their guns! Their property! They want to turn us into pushovers, so they can do just that.”\n\n“Normal people?” I asked, pushing back on John’s diatribe.\n\n“You guys want to keep your head in the sand about where we are going as a people, fine. But society can’t take these kind of changes and not pay a consequence for them. If you let the rot creep in, it takes over.”\n\n“How does any of this connect to the tornado alarm?” I said, feeling the exhaustion of the late night and John’s right-wing rambling set in.\n\n“Clay warned us about the deep state. He said the stormtroopers would come at night and lock us up. I’m worried this might be the start of something big.”\n\n“I’ll grant you this, if they wanted to ensure the citizens they rolled up wouldn’t be armed, a tornado alarm in the middle of the night would be a way to do it,” I said.\n\nJohn laughed. “Speak for yourself,” he said, raising his shirt to expose a handgun tucked into his pajama pants.\n\n“What the fuck, man?” I said.\n\n“I’ll never be caught off guard,” he said with a smile. “Old Pete and I go everywhere together. Let one of these stormtroopers come around here. I’ll blast him where he stands. You both can thank me later.”\n\nThe screaming tornado alarms suddenly went quiet. You could hear the echo in your mind, but the typical night noises returned to the world outside our gray matter. Crickets reigned supreme again. We all looked at each other in delighted amazement.\n\n“Guess it wasn’t stormtroopers after all,” I said. Rick laughed. John didn’t.\n\nAbove us, we heard an eardrum bursting boom. It was like a bomb went off above our heads, only we hadn’t seen anything streak by.\n\n“That was a sonic boom,” John said.\n\nSeconds later, we heard a different type of boom. Whatever had flown over us had exploded. You could just barely make out the orange flames in the dark clouds.\n\n“Aww Jesus tapdancing Christ,” John said, removing his red cap and placing it over his heart.\n\n“What the hell is that?” I said, pointing up at the sky.\n\nBreaking through the clouds was a white parachute. It was drifting so violently from side to side that I feared it would tip over and send the occupant plunging to the earth. Whoever was strapped to the chute wasn’t steering anything. They were dropping right towards our street.\n\nThere was another sonic boom over our heads, quickly followed by another explosion. Seconds later, another white flower bloomed in the sky. Like their compatriot, they looked zonked out on their southward descent.\n\nThe first parachuting pilot showed no signs of slowing and landed harder on the ground than they should of. As soon as their legs hit the pavement of the road, you could hear the sickening snap of both legs. That woke the pilot up. The man screamed so loud I was afraid he’d break glass.\n\nRick had been a paramedic in his younger years and ran over to the pilot to help in any way he could. The pilot frantically ripped his helmet and reached for his broken legs, but his harness wouldn’t let him grab them. It was for the best. His legs had broken at the shin and were barely attached.\n\n“Hey, man, I know it hurts, but stop thrashing around. You’re going to make it worse, okay? We can save the legs, but you need to listen,” Rick said in a more confident and serious tone than I had ever heard him.\n\n“We’re all fucked!” the pilot said, his eyes wide. “That thing isn’t going to let any of us live. Just put a bullet into me! Shoot me! Shoot me!”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw John walk up. I was worried he would acquiesce to the pilot’s request. But, instead, he smacked the guy across the face. The pilot’s frantic motions and screaming stopped.\n\n“You’re in the uniform. Act like it,” John said. He nodded at Rick, “Let this man do his job, okay?”\n\nThe pilot, still dazed, just nodded. I looked over at John, and we locked eyes. I hated the dude, but that was pretty clutch. I gave him a nod, and he returned the favor. Rick was able to unhitch the pilot from his ejector seat and lay him on the ground. He went to work making a splint as best he could.\n\nAbout a dozen people tried to call 911, but their phones didn’t work. They couldn’t find a signal. Suddenly, the power in the entire neighborhood went out. We were standing in pitch-black darkness when we heard the second pilot land on the street with another snap of their legs. The screams that followed echoed through the quiet neighborhood.\n\n“Paul?” I heard a familiar voice call out. It was Cindy. She was standing with my children on the side of the house. I had dawdled, and she was true to her word. “Paul, what’s going on?”\n\n“I…”\n\nI never got to finish that thought. From above us came a bassy trumpet blast that did shatter glass. Everyone grabbed their ears and squatted to the ground as if that would make it disappear. I felt my internal organs vibrating. It was unsettling.\n\nAfter the longest ten seconds in my life, the trumpet blast stopped. I looked over at my kids, and they were sobbing. Cindy did everything she could to hold them together. I ran over, my legs wobbly from the noise, and hugged them tightly.\n\n“Daddy, what’s going on?” my son asked, sobbing.\n\n“I dunno,” I said, deciding that honesty was better than not.\n\n“Is something coming for us?” my daughter said, fear rising in her voice.\n\n“No, baby. I don’t think so.” I gave her a tight hug. My eyes looked up until they locked with Cindy’s panic-stricken face. “I won’t let anything happen to you.”\n\n“Who are those guys?” my son said, pointing at the two wounded pilots.\n\n“Pilots.”\n\n“Where are their planes?”\n\nA ball the size of a compact car came hurtling toward the ground. Everyone on the street screamed and ran for cover. The debris slammed into the Anderson home ten houses down, sending a shock wave that swept everyone off their feet.\n\nI stood in time to see a second ball hurtling toward our neighborhood. I dove over my family and shielded them as the metal ball slammed into John’s house. It instantly exploded, and flames started eating away the home.\n\nI lay on them until the dust from the explosion settled. Once I was sure there wasn’t anything else raining down on us, I got to my feet. My vision was hazy from the dust in the air, but I had a clear view of the ball that destroyed John’s house. It was one of the jets. Something in the clouds had crumbled up a half-billion-dollar weapon of war like it was a kid’s paper airplane.\n\n“That thing isn’t natural,” the first pilot screamed.\n\n“This isn’t the first attack,” the second one yelled.\n\n“They’ll come for you all! Run! Run before they come after you!”\n\nThe night sky was again broken by the bone-rattling bass of that horn blowing. Again, we all dropped and covered our ears again. The horn stopped but echoed for ten seconds before it finally dissipated. We all craned our necks and were treated to an explosion of red, blue, green, and yellow lights illuminating the clouds. At first blush, it looked random, but it wasn’t. It was a pattern. The pattern repeated two more times, and then everything went dark.\n\nIt was silent and calm again. All the sounds of the natural world rushed back to your ears. Crickets continued their symphonies, and a gentle breeze blew. It would be idyllic if it weren’t for the raging house fires, panic-stricken pilots, and the balled-up aircraft next to me.\n\n“Is that it?” I said out loud to the universe.\n\nI heard a rumbling coming down our street. My emotions couldn’t take any more shock, but I was bracing for whatever the fuck was coming. I was ready to sprint and hide with my family if I needed to. Soon, the humming of dozens of engines filled our ears. The bright yellow headlights of the lead truck illuminated the street. There were dozens of pairs behind them.\n\nI was worried this was a foreign invading force but relaxed when I saw an American flag on the side of the trucks. The stars and stripes on the cadre of military vehicles put my mind at ease. For a second, anyway. Then the inevitable question popped into my mind. Cindy beat me to the punch.\n\n“What the hell is the Army doing here?” she asked.\n\n“I...I dunno.”\n\nThe line of trucks came to a halt. The engines idled, and the noise drowned out the crickets. Even though it was dark, you could still see the exhaust puffing into the air. After a beat, the passenger side of the lead truck popped open, and a high-ranking Army official exited the vehicle. He clutched a bullhorn in one hand and a walkie-talkie in the other.\n\nSeeing the wounded pilots, he whispered something into his walkie-talkie. Seconds later, we heard the doors of an ambulance open and men marching with medical gear to retrieve the pilots. Rick tried to help, but he was pushed aside. He didn’t argue, just took a step back.\n\nThe medical men stabbed the pilots with some sort of pain medication because they both stopped talking and slumped over in the stretchers. Seconds later, they were placed in the back of an ambulance and gone from our sight.\n\nThe Army official looked at the gathered group of people and raised his bullhorn. In a loud and gruff voice, he spoke. “Many of you are probably wondering what happened here. It’s my job to inform you that there has been an accident in the skies above your town. Two American pilots experienced a catastrophic failure, and their planes were destroyed. The United States armed forces will compensate everyone for this unfortunate error. If your house has been destroyed, please contact our intelligence agents, who will gather your information. Again, the United States armed forces apologizes for this event. Thank you.” He lowered his bullhorn.\n\n“What were they engaging with?” Rick asked. The crowd around him suddenly found their courage and demanded answers.\n\nThe Official raised the bullhorn again. “They did not encounter anything. Their jet’s systems malfunctioned and crashed.”\n\n“That’s bullshit,” Rick yelled.\n\n“I understand this is a lot to take in at once, but we are here to help you,” the Official said. “This was a malfunction on the jets that caused the crash.”\n\nI had heard enough bullshit. I took a few steps toward the Official and pointed at the balled-up remains of the jet, “Something crushed that fuckin’ plane like it was a potato chip! It’s in the shape of a ball, for God’s sake!”\n\n“The pilots were screaming about something coming to kill us. What is that about?” Rick said, his anger rising with the crowds. This group of neighbors and block party participants was rounding into an angry mob right before my eyes.\n\n“They were in shock from the trauma,” the Official said, “oftentimes, pain will make you say things.”\n\n“No it doesn’t,” Rick said, “I worked in trauma hospitals my whole life. No one ever starts ranting about government conspiracies when they get hurt! What aren’t you telling us?”\n\n“We are telling you the truth.”\n\n“I think he’s lying,” I screamed. The crowd cheered in agreement.\n\nThere was palpable anger growing in the crowd. The Official must’ve sensed it, too, because he glanced back at the convoy of trucks and gave a curt nod. Suddenly, every door opened, and full-armed soldiers got out and fell into formation behind him.\n\n“You can’t intimidate us! You can’t force a lie onto us! We know what we saw!”\n\nHe raised his bullhorn again, “You are mistaken, sir. Hallucination is a side effect of exposure to the chemicals from the exploded jet. I recommend you all go into your homes and wait until our clean-up crews can ensure the spill is contained.”\n\nAt once, every soldier flipped off their safeties. The message was clear – go and forget this happened or else. Despite the implied threat, something in me snapped. Instead of being cowed, I took another step toward the soldiers. I picked up a rock and hurled it at the smashed jet. It rang off the metal.\n\n“That’s not a fuckin’ hallucination. That’s real,” I said, pointing up at the sky, “whatever the fuck up there did, this was real too. We heard the noise. We saw the lights. It set off the tornado alarms!”\n\n“Sir, I advise you and your family to return to your home….”\n\nA gunshot rang out. For a second, everyone froze in place. I was worried the soldiers would open fire on us. I felt my resolve drain from me in that moment of impending death. I looked over and realized John had let “old Pete” join the conversation. The old Marine stood with a pissed-off scowl on his face and his smoking gun aimed at the sky.\n\n“What about *my* home?” I looked over at was surprised to see John walking toward the soldiers, as angry as I’d ever seen him. “It’s gone.”\n\n“As I said,” the Official started. John fired another shot in the air to silence him. The soldiers trained their guns on John, but a subtle hand gesture from the Official kept the bullets from flying.\n\n“I gave everything for this country. For the Constitution! For freedom! I gave my youth fighting for this country. Side to side with brothers in arms. I watched friends die! I knew the government was full of shit, but I always believed the military was a safeguard. But now? This is the shit you’re gonna pull on us? This is how you treat a fellow service member?”\n\n“Thank you for your service,” the Official said.\n\n“Blow it out your ass,” John retorted.\n\nThe crowd went nuts. We all started yelling and massing. Cindy grabbed at me, but I turned and told her to take the kids inside. She opened her mouth to protest but stopped when we locked eyes. It was righteous indignation. I had to see this, though. She grabbed my kids and rushed them back into the safety of the house.\n\nThe Official gave another signal, and three soldiers aimed their weapons into the air and fired off a few dozen rounds. The crowd went silent so quickly you could hear the shell casing hit the concrete. It sounded like a baby playing a xylophone. The crowd stopped advancing.\n\nThe Official ignored the rest of us and focused all his attention on John. “I understand your frustration, but if you were a good soldier, you’d remember the chain of command,” the Official said, nodding to his rank designation on his shoulder. “Good soldiers follow rank. You’re a good soldier, right?”\n\nThat caught John. He paused, and you could see him mulling the words over in his mind. This man had acquiesced to power his whole life. Hell, he had been a tool of it for most of his adult years. Now, for the first time, he was challenging it. John saw himself as an honorable man. A loyal man. Not a rabble-rouser or shit-stirrer. We all waited for him to respond with bated breath.\n\nThen the rain started falling.\n\nOr, I thought it was rain, but when it hit my arm, it burned. Each drop sizzled as it hit our skin. A person in the crowd looked, and a drop hit them square in the eye. They screamed in pain and fell to the ground, clutching their face. It was like some kind of acid was falling on us.\n\n“Oh shit,” the Official said, all of his bluster fleeing at once, “They seeded the clouds! They’re coming! Everyone, back inside the vehicles!”\n\nAll of the soldiers hustled back inside their trucks. The Official gave the crowd a look and yelled, “Get inside! Now!” before he took off for the safety of his truck. I turned and ran for my house. As I did, a trumpet blast sent a shock wave that created a small earthquake. I tripped and fell, the falling rain stinging my exposed neck. My ears rang from the blast, but I willed myself into the house.\n\nAs soon as I entered the door, I stripped off my clothes and tossed them outside. The rain had started to eat through the fabric. I wrapped myself in a throw blanket and rushed to the window to watch the scene unfolding in front of us.\n\nI was surprised to see John still standing out there. He hadn’t moved from that spot. It was like the decision to go against his core beliefs had caused a malfunction in his brain. As he had aged, his beliefs had curdled into conspiracy. The force he thought was a bulwark against his dreaded deep state now seemed to be working in concert with it. It was too much for him to bear.\n\nEven with the prodding of acid rain, John didn’t move. He stood there and let the rain eat him away piece by piece. He didn’t even scream as his skin sloughed off his body. Instead, he raised old Pete to his temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nI slammed the blinds shut and turned away. Reality had broken through. We were in real danger. I grabbed my family and went to the back of the house. We’d ride out whatever was happening and pray it didn’t get worse. My kids asked me to explain what was going on, but I didn’t find an answer that wouldn’t make things worse. I, instead, hugged them tight and told them I loved them.\n\nAll we could hear outside was the rain – or whatever it actually was – falling on the roof. I prayed it wouldn’t eat through the shingles. I knew there was probably a bee’s hive worth of activity going on outside with the military there. Still, my rational brain had returned to me. I no longer cared about anything but surviving the night.\n\nWe stayed that way for two hours. At some point, the adrenaline wore off, and the three of them fell asleep. I couldn’t, though, because my mind was still reeling. But more than that, I felt the energy around me shift. I felt my mind start to slip.\n\nI’ve written all this down because I think something *is* messing with my mind, and I wanted to share my story in case I go crazy or something. I wanted to make sure I got the details just right in case my brain is liquefying or something. I don’t know what’s waiting for us tomorrow morning, but I’m not sure I’ll even make it until then.\n\nAs soon as I got inside, I started feeling a tickling sensation down my arms and legs. It’s like someone was dragging their fingernails down my skin. I think this has to do with that rain because no one else in my house mentioned feeling that. The rain never fell on them.\n\nIn the last ten or so minutes, I’ve started noticing moving black shadows in the corners of my vision. When I look at the figures, they disappear. But they return. They always return. I can sense them watching me. I...I don’t know what they are or what they want, but I’m sure they’re not here for a cup of coffee.\n\nI can feel my eyes growing heavy, but I’m afraid to sleep. I’m worried they’ll come for me then. I’m so scared I’ll end up like John. I’m feeling my strength drain from me. I’m drifting now, powering down. I see them emerging from the shadows. Oh God."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n\"Poor guy seems almost happy to be rid of it.\"\n\nJack looked at the man framed in the window, turning away with some effort.\n\n\"He probably is,\" Jack said as we climbed into the cab of the truck.\n\nHe stood at the window as we pulled away, just silently watching us drive up the road with his missing wife's Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhen the order came in today, I expected it would be one of the bad ones. Given the circumstances, the bank had extended his payments for as long as possible, but the time had finally come to call in their debt. I've been a repossession specialist, a repo man, for about three years now. I work for a private outfit, Larken Brothers, out of Atlanta, Georgia. In a city that size, you see a lot of unpaid car notes, so there's always business for a man in my line of work. I've seen a lot in three years. I've had people attack my vehicle, pull guns on me, and try to drive cars off my truck after I've chained them in.\n\nThis repossession, though, was definitely the most shocking thing I've ever seen.\n\nDavid Gurshly had become something of a local celebrity after the disappearance of his wife, Evelynn. David was a heart doctor whose practice was frequented by many. He was touted as a miracle worker and had performed many complicated procedures that his colleagues refused to take on. He was well respected in the community and well-liked by his patients.\n\nSo when his wife had disappeared, David had not been at the top of their suspect list.\n\nWe pulled out of the gated community and onto the main road. As the traffic cruised, I caught myself looking at the car in the rearview mirror as Jack made his way for the lot. It was pristine, only having a few dings from the various adventures Mrs. Gurshly had taken it on. It was a wonder the wheels were still on it, given Evelynn's track record.\n\nIf David Gurshly was famous, Evelynn Gurshly was infamous. Evelynn was a staple in Atlanta's social scene. She was out every weekend, carousing, drinking, and calling the local hospitals looking for David. She had been in several tabloids, the papers bemoaning that such a man as David had such an embarrassing wife as her. David was no angel, of course. Their fights had been heated, her breakdowns were epic, and if I was David Gurshly, I think I'd have been relieved when she just went missing.\n\nLooking in the rearview mirror as Jack drove, I did a double take and almost told him to pull over.\n\nI looked at the mirror again and shook my head as I saw nothing was there.\n\nI had been sure that I could see someone in the driver's seat, a woman with long blonde hair as if the ghost of Evelynn Gurshly were taking it for one last spin.\n\n\"You okay, kid?\" Jack asked, and I nodded as I looked out the window instead.\n\nI guess everyone was hoping to see Evelynn Gurshly these days.\n\nDavid had reported her missing a few days after she'd left in her green Corolla, but she hadn't been officially classified as a missing person until they found her car by the side of the road. That had been about a month ago, and everyone was keeping an eye out for her, though most assumed she was out on one of her typical benders. Evelynn did these sorts of things, after all, and it was expected that she would show up again after her credit cards stopped working.\n\nWe pulled into the lot, and the gate chugged shut behind us. I got out and helped Jack unload the car. The tires bounced a little as they hit the ground, and I could have sworn that something bumped in the trunk. It didn't sound like the usual bump of a spare tire banging around, that semimetal thunk of the rubber circle coming loose. It made me want to open it so I could investigate, but that was a big no-no. We were paid to bring the cars to the lot, not inspect them. That was a different department, and the boss didn't like it if the jumpsuits, as they called us, went rifling through the cars in the impound.\n\nBesides, we had more work to do.\n\nAs we rode to the next stop, I couldn't help thinking about the car and the missing lady who had once driven around in it.\n\nEvelyn Gurshly hadn't been officially missing till after her car had been found. It wasn't uncommon for Evelynn to just go off for days at a time, but she always sobered up and called her husband for money so she could get home. She had been missing a few years ago, back when I was in high school, and I only remember it because the football team, of which I was a member, had gone to help look for her. We had canvassed the area around their house, the nearby bar she often drank at, and the surrounding woods where her car had been found. Her husband had come with us, and I had talked with him a few times as we canvassed. I had liked David, he was easy to talk to, and you could tell that, despite how his wife acted sometimes, he loved her too.\n\nWhen she called him from South Florida after a week of being missing, he had wired her money for a plane ticket, and the search was called off.\n\nSo when she had been reported missing this time, no one really expected much of it. She would call soon, maybe from Jamaica or New York, and he would send her money so she could come home again. It was easy to roll your eyes at the pair, but I always kind of felt sorry for him. Doctor Gurshly did more pro bono work than any other surgeon in the state, and he was one of the most respected heart surgeons in his field. Were it not for his wife, he would have nothing but his glowing reputation, but people love to see someone fall. They always harked on the idea that he couldn't control his wife and her drinking problem. He had long ago stopped bringing her to large functions, but that hardly stopped her from showing up and making a scene.\n\nAs we hooked the car to the ramp, the owner already shouting from the porch about getting his lawyer, I wondered why he didn't just divorce her if she was such an embarrassment.\n\nI supposed maybe he didn't want her to drink up the half of his money that she took, but that was only a guess.\n\nWhen we got back, Lisa was waiting for us on the curb. Lisa was our receptionist, a cute little dark-haired girl of the Latin persuasion. She could be fiery, she could be fiesty, but the look she wore now led me to believe that she was about to turn pleading. Lisa was a good worker but didn't like going back into the impound area if she could help. The keys she was holding in her left hand made me think she was probably about to ask Jack or me to get a car for her, and I rolled my window down and told her to toss them in.\n\nShe smiled, \"You're a peach. It's the red Fiesta in spot fifty-five. If you could bring it up while I do the paperwork, I'll buy you lunch sometime.\"\n\nI caught the keys and told her it was a date as Jack and I rumbled into the impound.\n\n\"You know when she says lunch, that's all she's talking about, right?\" Jack asked as the gate closed behind us.\n\nI snorted, \"You don't know that. Maybe that's just how it starts.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes, \"Whatever, Casanova. Go make sure everything's ready for this puppy to roll off.\"\n\nI climbed out and went around to the back, checking the leads and ensuring everything was ready for a smooth touchdown. As I watched the truck begin to lower the back, a loud and unpleasant process, my eyes strayed to the Green Corrolla we had parked earlier. It looked kind of forlorn just sitting there, that faithful engine that had taken Mrs. Gurshly to so many watering holes and returned her safely home again.\n\nAs I looked at it, something was dripping from the back of it. It was slowly dripping onto the sand and grass of the impound lot, and the drops were thick and viscous. It looked like radiator fluid, and I wondered if we had broken something in the trunk when we dropped it down? Maybe some chemicals or spare engine fluids? I was drawn back to reality as Jack yelled at me to get out of the way, the ramp missing me by inches as I jumped back. I helped guide the car back, unhooking the chains when it was level, and Jack groused at me for daydreaming as I came back to the cab for the keys.\n\nI parked it in spot sixty-eight, and as I drove past the Corolla in Lisa's Fiesta, I was glad to see that the puddle had stopped growing.\n\nI didn't think of the Corolla again until Friday.\n\nI was getting ready to go get some lunch; Lisa prepared to make good on her promise when my boss asked me to pull the Corolla from Doctor Gurshly to the inspection bay.\n\n\"The dealership wants to pick it up today, and we need to get it inspected so they can have it.\"\n\nI nodded, grabbing the keys and heading into the lot to get the car.\n\nInspections are mostly to ensure that we hadn't screwed anything up while repoing it and that any damage from the owner was cataloged. As I climbed in behind the wheel, I knew something was amiss at once. It had been hot the last few days, an absolute scorcher, and the car smelled like there might be rotten food in it somewhere. No, not old food. More like someone had hit an animal, and it had gotten knocked into the undercarriage. I cranked the car and rolled the windows down, powering through the task as I tried not to lose my appetite along the way. Marge was waiting for me, a stocky middle-aged mother of three who runs the detailing area, and she pinched her nose as she smelled the aroma through the windows.\n\n\"Jesus, what an odor.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I agreed, \"kinda smells like roadkill. Maybe something in the undercarriage?\"\n\n\"I'll get it on the hoist and have a look. Thanks for bringing it around.\"\n\nI waved at her as I moved off and met Lisa by the front as the two of us headed off to lunch.\n\nOn that score, Jack had been right, but the real surprise was what awaited me as I walked back alone.\n\nLisa had paid for lunch, but she had taken hers to go so she could run some errands with her boyfriend. Eating my barbeque basket took some of the sting out of this revelation, but it made the walk back by myself twice as pathetic. I had struck out again, but at least there were another three hours of work to keep my mind off it, right?\n\nI had just stepped into the repo lot to look for Jack when someone screamed like they were being murdered.\n\nI saw Jack heading for the inspection bay on the run, and I was right behind him as another scream shivered into the afternoon sky.\n\nIt was Marge, and it appeared that she had found the terrible smell.\n\nIt hadn't been roadkill or even old food, but it had solved the mystery of what had befallen Evelynn Gurshly.\n\nThe corpse had been in the trunk, its flesh mostly liquified by now, and the face stared out at us from two empty pits. The eyes were gone, the face eaten by bugs until the skull peeked out, but it was nowhere near as grizzly as the wound on her chest.\n\nSomeone had cut her chest open, and the place where her heart should be gleamed wetly from her putrefied flesh.\n\nThe police came quickly when we told them what we believed we had found and whose trunk it had been inside.\n\nThey questioned all of us, wanting to know everything we had seen since taking the car.\n\nIt didn't take long before Doctor Gurshly was taken into custody, and the cop confided in me that he hadn't fought them.\n\n\"It was like he was just waiting for us to come and find us.\"\n\nOver the next few days, the details came out in the news, shedding some light on why the beloved David Gurshly had murdered his wife. Evelynn had caught him cheating, that much was known, but the two had seemed to reconcile. Evelynn hadn't wanted to leave. She had the best possible life, and with David's money, she could continue to drink and cavort as she chose.\n\nThen David met Linda Smalls, and things changed.\n\nLinda Smalls was a pillar of the community. She organized charity events, worked to set up soup kitchens and clothing drives, raised her five boys, and became the breadwinner for her home after her husband's stroke last year had left him partially paralyzed. She helped so many, but it seemed that no one would be there to help when she was in need.\n\nNo one besides David Gurshly.\n\nDavid had been following her case, hoping to find a proper donor for her. She had the same blood type as Evelynn, but the two couldn't be more different. David tried his best to find her a donor, but as her time grew closer, he realized she wasn't going to find a new heart in time.\n\nNot unless he took drastic measures.\n\n\"He cut out his wife's heart, using the skills he had developed over years of doing the same for patients, and donated it to Linda Smalls anonymously. He told the police that he was beginning to wonder what he would do with the body, hiding it in the basement of their home, before the police brought her care back. After that, it was just a matter of picking the right time to stash it in the trunk.\"\n\nThey said that as calm as David was, Linda was a basket-case. \n\n\"The revelation that someone had committed murder for her had caused a lot of stress to Linda Smalls, but she has taken it as an opportunity to do good works with the sacrifice that was made for her.\"\n\nI think back on that every now and again, telling the other new guys about it now that it's my turn to drive the truck since Jack retired last year.\n\nFrom then on, the boss made it a rule to check the trunks of cars before we left them in the lot. All vehicles are searched for anything suspicious before we sign off on them so that nothing like this happens again. We're more careful now, but I doubt we'll ever encounter a situation that weird again.\n\nAt least, I hope not."

        "author": "MoodyMycelium",
        "selftext": "As the Director, the pole bearers, the Vicar and the single attendee make their way up the driveway, the Grave Digger sits in a tired chair in his cosy concrete shed. The shed itself, just big enough for a small fridge, microwave, a couple of well worn chairs and an all important kettle. Outside, the sprawling cemetery's neatly kept lawns carry a scent of freshly cut grass. The well weathered limestone and marble headstones of older sections highlight a stark contrast with the shinier and more durable granite headstones of newer sections of the cemetery. There's a slight chill as the sun is setting on another day.\n\nWith a click of the boiled kettle, the grave digger stands and goes over to the counter to prepare a flask of tea. \"Well Sam, I 'spose we best meet the new resident\", he says.\n\nWith his spade in one hand and his flask in the other, the Grave Digger makes his way down the driveway towards the reopened grave.\n\n\"Evenin'\", says the Grave Digger, in a warm and welcoming tone. He sets down his flask and sets his spade in the mound of soil, beside the open grave. \n\nThe faint blue-white spirit lifts his head and with a bemused look on his face says \"You can see me?\".\n\n\"Yeahhh, I can see ya, it's kinda my thing. I get to personally greet each new member to this fine cemetery\". The Grave Digger grabs his spade and begins to refill the grave.\n\n\"Speaking with the dead and yet you're so casual about it. Don't you use this extraordinary talent?\", asks the spirit.\n\n\"I didn't ask for this 'talent'\", replies the Grave Digger, \"There'll be no holding hands in a circle and bothering the departed. I only see you in your last moments, here in the cemetery\".\n\n\"Oh, I see\", says the spirit, his expression shifting from bemusement to a subtle sadness as he reckons with being in his final moments.\n\n\"Anyway, I see you're joinin' your dear old mum in there, were you two close?\", asks the Grave Digger. He stands for a breather, sensing the spirits change in mood.\n\n\"Oh God no!\", exclaims the spirit, \"We hadn't spoke in thirty odd years. She had reserved a double plot. She went in first according to her prearranged plans. I died unexpectedly, I hadn't made plans for what I wanted to happen to my body. I assume since the space was available, my Landlord decided I should be buried here.\"\n\n\"Blimey, that's a long time for you two not to speak. She must have done somethin' pretty bad\".\n\nThe spirit lightly shrugs and faces the grave digger, who had just poured himself a mug of tea from his flask. \"You know I can't even remember what we fell out about. Either it's been so long or the memory has been lost in death. I was 18 and we'd had a row over something. I left and ended up about 40 miles away, on the edge of Manchester, where I lived out my life. I died in my flat there. Heart attack. They may have been able to save me if those blasted roadworks hadn't appeared at the end of the street just a few days before. The man who you would have seen attend my burial today was my Landlord. I believe he's arranged everything. I didn't know anybody else.\"\n\nThe Grave Digger sips his warm tea, it's heat dissipating rather quickly in the cool evening air. \"I'm awfully sorry to hear all that. Did neither of you try to make amends at all?\".\n\n\"She tried to contact me, even left a large inheritance but I never touched it. Thinking about it now, she never had an issue with me, I was just a stubborn git. There were no real barriers, just the emotional blocks on my shoulders. No wonder my heart eventually broke. She'd have probably jumped at the phone if I'd ever rang. She never stopped loving me, now I'm about to re-join her. She reserved this plot as if she knew I'd find my way back somehow. I feel strangely peaceful in these last moments. Something I can't remember ever feeling in life. I miss her a lot right now.\"\n\nThe Grave Digger looks at the spirit and can't help but feel a little pity for him. \"A lot of spirits I meet here feel a similar way as you do now. It's almost as if death offers us a chance for a fresh start. Or a chance to clear the air at least. Who knows where ya go once I fill your grave in.\" The grave digger offers a friendly smile to the spirit as he continues to shovel dirt into the grave.\n\n\"Thankyou. It's been nice having you listen. Is there anything you'd like to know? Not at all curious about this side of existence, hmm?\", asks the spirit.\n\n\"I only have one question for the spirits I welcome here. What did you have for tea on your last night? What was your last supper?\", the Grave Digger asks the spirit, with a light chuckle, his eyes slightly squinted from the smile he's bearing.\n\n\"An extraordinary ability and all you want to know is my last meal?\". The spirit looks at the grave digger, wide eyed. \"Well, if I remember correctly, I had a large fish and chips, from the local chippy. With extra salt and mushy peas.\"\n\nThe Grave Digger heaps the last of the soil onto the grave and pats it down with the back of his spade. The spirits shape fades away into the still evening air, like mist in a breeze, as the Grave Digger places the single bouquet of flowers, left by the Landlord, on the mounded grave. He grabs his spade and his flask, he takes a deep breath and lets out a sigh of satisfaction. As he turns to walk away he quietly says, \"Well Sam, I 'spose it's fish and chips tonight. I think we'll lay off the extra salt though ay.\" "

        "author": "Erutious",
        "selftext": "Charles stepped into Fun Land Amusements and ground his teeth at the sight of children playing skeeball and air hockey and the *waka waka waka* of Pacman that filled the air.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo reduced to playing chess in a place such as this.\n\n\n\nThe owner started to say something to the well-dressed gentleman, but Charles waved him off. \n\nHe didn't need directions, he and Gizmo were old friends and he could practically smell the old gypsy from here. That was one of those words his great-great-grandchildren would have told him was a \"cancelable offense\" but Charles didn't care. Much like The Great Gizmo, Charles was from a different age.\n\n\n\nCharles had first met Gizmo in Nineteen Nineteen when the world was still new and things made sense.\n\n\n\nIt had been at an expo in Connie Island, and his father had been rabid to see it.\n\n\n\n\"They say it's from Europe, and it has been touring since the eighteen hundred. It's supposed to play chess like a gran master, Charlie Boy, and they claim it's never been beaten. I want you to be the first one to do it, kiddo.\"\n\n\n\nCharlie's Father had been a trainman, an engineer, and a grease monkey who had never gotten farther than the fifth grade. He had learned everything he knew at the side of better men, but he knew Charles was special. Charles was nine and already doing High school math, not just reading Shakespeare but understanding what he meant, and doing numbers good enough to get a job at the Brokers House if he wanted it. His father wouldn't hear of it, though. No genius son of his was going to run numbers for Bingo Boys, not when he could get an education and get away from this cesspool.  \n\n\n\n\"Education, Charlie, that's what's gonna lift you above the rest of us. Higher learning is what's going to get you a better life than your old man.\"\n\n\n\nOne thing his Dad did love though was chess. Most of the train guys knew the typical games, cards, dice, checkers, chess, but Charle's Dad had loved the game best of all. He was no grand master, barely above a novice, but he had taught Charles everything he knew about it from a very young age, and Charles had absorbed it like a sponge. He was one of the best in the burrows, maybe one of the best in the city, and he had taken third in the Central Park Chess Finals last year. \"And that was against guys three times your age, kid.\" his Dad had crowed.\n\n\n\nNow, he wanted his son to take on The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\nThe exhibition was taking place in a big tent not far from the show hall, and it was standing room only. Lots of people wanted to see this machine that could beat a man at chess, and they all wanted a turn to try it out. Most of them wouldn't, Charles knew, but they wanted the chance to watch it beat better men than them so they could feel superior for a little while.\n\n\n\nCharles didn't intend to give them the satisfaction.\n\n\n\nThe man who'd introduced the thing had been dressed in a crisp red and white striped suit, his flat-topped hat making him look like a carnival barker. He had thumped his cane and called the crowd to order, his eyes roving the assembled men and woman as if just searching for the right victim.\n\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentleman, what I have here is the most amazing technical marvel of the last century. He has bested Kings, Geniuses, and Politicians in the art of Chess and is looking for his next challenge. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, The Great GIZMO!\"\n\n\n\nCharles hadn't been terribly impressed when the man tore back the tarp and revealed the thing. It looked like a fortune teller, dressed in a long robe with a turban on its head boasting a tall feather and a large gem with many facets. It had a beard, a long mustachio that drooped with rings and bells, and a pair of far too expressive marble eyes. It moved jerkily, like something made of wires, and the people oooed and awwed over it, impressed.\n\n\n\n\"Now then, who will be the first to test its staggering strategy? Only five dollars for the chance to best The Great Gizmo.\"\n\n\n\nCharle's father had started to step forward, but Charles put a hand on his arm.\n\n\n\n\"Let's watch for a moment, Dad. I want to see how he plays.\"\n\n\n\n\"You sure?\" his Dad had asked, \"I figured you'd stump it first and then we'd walk off with the glory.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Charles said, standing back to watch as the first fellow approached, paying his money and taking a seat.\n\n\n\nThis was how Charles liked to play. First came the observation period, where he watched and made plans. He liked to stand back, blending in with the crowd so he could take the measure of his opponent. People rarely realized that you were studying their moves, planning counter moves, and when you stepped up and trounced them, they never saw it coming. That was always his favorite part, watching their time-tested strategies fall apart as they played on and destroyed themselves by second-guessing their abilities.\n\n\n\nThat hadn't happened that day in the tent at Connie Island.\n\n\n\nAs much as he watched and as much as he learned, Charles never quite understood the strategy at play with The Great Gizmo. He stuck to no gambit, he initiated no set strategy, and he was neither aggressive nor careful. He answered their moves with the best counter move available, every time, and he never failed to thwart them.\n\n\n\nAfter five others had been embarrassed, to the general amusement of the crowd, Charles decided it was his turn.\n\n\n\n\"A kid?\" the barker asked, \"Mr, I'll take your money, but I hate to steal from a man.\"\n\n\n\nHis Father had puffed up at that, \"Charlie is a chess protege. He'll whip your metal man.\"\n\n\n\nAnd so Charles took his seat, sitting eye to glass eye with the thing, and the game began.\n\n\n\nCharles would play a lot of chess in his long life, but he would never play a game quite that one-sided again.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo thwarted him at every move, countered his counters, ran circles around him, and by the end Charles wasn't sure he had put up any sort of fight at all. He had a middling collection of pieces, barely anything, and Gizmo had everything.\n\n\n\n\"Check Mate,\" the thing rasped, its voice full of secret humor, and Charles had nodded before walking away in defeat.\n\n\n\n\"No sweat, Charlie boy.\" His father had assured him, \"Damn creepy things a cheat anyway. That's what it is, just a cheating bit of nothing.\"\n\n\n\nCharles hadn't said anything, but he had made a vow to beat that pile of wires next time the chance arose.\n\n\n\nCharles saw The Great Gizmo sitting in the back of the arcade, forgotten and unused. He didn't know how much the owner had paid for it, but he doubted it was making it back. The Great Gizmo was a relic. No one came to the arcade to play chess anymore. There was a little placard in front of him telling his history and a sign that asked patrons not to damage the object. The camera over him probably helped with that, but it was likely more than that.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo looked like something that shouldn't exist, something that flew in the face of this \"uncanny valley\" that his great-grandson talked about sometimes, and people found it offputting.\n\n\n\nCharles, however, was used to it.\n\n\n\n\"Do you remember me?\" he asked, putting in a quarter as the thing shuddered and seemed to look up at him.\n\n\n\nIts robes were faded, its feather ragged, but its eyes were still intelligent.\n\n\n\n\"Charles,\" it croaked, just as it had on that long ago day.\n\n\n\nCharles had been in his second year of high school when he met The Great Gizmo for the second time. School was more a formality than anything, he could pass any test a college entrance board could throw at him, but they wouldn't give him the chance until he had a diploma. He was sixteen, a true protege now, and his chess skills had only increased over the years. He had taken Ruby Fawn to the fair that year and that was where he saw the sign proclaiming The Great Gizmo would be in attendance. He had drug her over to the tent, the girl saying she didn't want to see that creepy old thing, but he wanted a second chance at it.\n\n\n\nHis father was still working in the grease pits of the train yard, but he knew his face would light up when he heard how his son had bested his old chess rival.\n\n\n\nThe stakes had increased in seven years, it seemed. It was now eight dollars to play the champ, but the winner got a fifty-dollar cash prize. Fifty dollars was a lot of money in nineteen twenty-six, but Charles wanted the satisfaction of besting this thing more than anything. Despite what his father wanted, he had been running numbers for John McLure and his gang for over a year, and some well-placed bets had left him flush with cash.\n\n\n\n“Good luck, young man,” said the Barker, and Charles was surprised to find that it was the same barker as before. Time had not been kind to him. His suit was now faded, his hat fraid around the rim, and he had put on weight which bulged around the middle and made the suit roll, spoiling the uniform direction of the stripes. Despite that, it was still him, and he grinned at Charles as he took the familiar seat.\n\n\n\nThis time, the match was a little different. Charles had increased in skill, and he saw through many of the traps Gizmo set for him. The audience whispered quietly behind him, believing that The Great Gizmo had met his match, but the real show was just beginning. Charles had taken several key pieces, and as he took a second rook, the thing's eyes sparkled and it bent down as if to whisper something to him. The crowd would not have heard it, its voice was too low, but The Great Gizmo whispered a secret to Charles that would stick with him forever.\n\n\n\n“Charles, this will not be our last game, we will play eight more times before the end.”\n\n\n\nIt was given in a tone of absolute certainty, not an offhand statement made to get more of Charles hard-earned money. Charles looked mystified, not sure if he had actually heard what the thing had said, and it caused him to flub his next move and lose a piece he had not wanted to.\n\n\n\nCharles persevered, however, pressing on and taking more pieces, and just as he believed victory was within his grasp, the thing spoke again.\n\n\n\n“Charles, you will live far longer than you may wish to.”\n\n\n\nAgain, it was spoken in that tone of absolute assuredness, and it caused Charles to miss what should’ve been obvious.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo won after two more moves and Charles was, again, defeated.\n\n\n\n“Better luck next time,” said the Barker, and even as Charles's date told him he had done really well, but Charles knew he would never be great until he beat this machine.\n\n\n\nThe pieces appeared, Charles set his up, and they began what would be their fourth game. Charles, strategically meeting the machine's offensive plays with his own practice gambits, would gladly admit that the three games he had played against The Great Gizmo had improved his chess game more than any other match he had ever played. Charles had faced old timers in the park, grandmasters at chess tournaments, and everything in between. Despite it all, The Great Gizmo never ceased to amaze and test his skill.\n\n\n\nCharles tried not to think about their last match.\n\n\n\nIt was a match where Charles had done the one thing he promised he would never do.\n\n\n\nHe had cheated.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo had become something of a mania in him after he had lost to it a second time. He had gone to college, married his sweetheart, and begun a job that paid well and was not terribly difficult. With his business acumen, Charles had been placed as the manager of a textile mill. Soon he had bought it and was running the mill himself. Charles had turned the profits completely around after he had purchased the mill, seeing what the owners were doing wrong and fixing it when the mill belonged to him. He’d come a long way from the little kid who sat in the tent at Coney Island, but that tent was never far from his mind.\n\n\n\nCharles had one obsession, and it was chess.\n\n\n\nEven his father had told him that he took the game far too seriously. He and his father still played at least twice a week, and it was mostly a chance for the two to talk. His father was not able to work the train yard anymore, he’d lost a leg to one of the locomotives when it had fallen out of the hoist on him, but that hardly mattered. His father lived at the home that Charles shared with his wife, a huge house on the main street of town, and his days were spent at leisure now.\n\n\n\n“You are the best chess player I have ever seen, Charlie, but you take it too seriously. It’s just a game, an entertainment, but you treat every chess match like it’s war.”\n\n\n\nCharles would laugh when he said these things, but his father was right.\n\n\n\nEvery chess match was war, and the General behind all those lesser generals was The Great Gizmo. He had seen the old golem in various fairs and sideshows, but he had resisted the urge to go and play again. He couldn’t beat him, not yet, and when he did play him, he wanted to be ready. He had studied chess the way some people study law or religion. He knew everything, at least everything that he could learn from books and experience, but it appeared he had one more teacher to take instruction from.\n\n\n\nCharles liked to go to the park and play against the old-timers that stayed there. Some of them had been playing chess longer and he had been alive, and they had found ways to bend or even break the established rules of strategy. On the day in question, he was playing against a young black man, he called himself Kenny, and when he had taken Charleses rook, something strange happened. The rook was gone, but so had his knight and had been beside it. Charles knew the knight had been there, but when he looked across the board, he saw that it was sitting beside the rook on Kenny's side. He had still won the match, Charles was at a point where he could win with nearly any four pieces on the board, but when they played again, he reached out and caught Kenny by the wrist as he went to take his castle off the board.\n\n\n\nIn his hand was a pawn as well, and Kenny grinned like it was all a big joke.\n\n\n\nCharles wasn’t mad, though, on the contrary. The move had been so quick and so smooth that he hadn’t even seen it the first time. He wondered if it would work for a creature that did not possess sight? It might be just the edge he was looking for.\n\n\n\n“Hey, man, we ain’t playing for money or nothing. There’s no need to get upset over it.”\n\n\n\n“Show me,” Charles asked, and Kenny was more than happy to oblige.\n\n\n\nKenny showed him the move, telling him that the piece palmed always had to be on the right of the piece you would take it.\n\n\n\n“If it’s on the left, they focus on that piece. If it’s on the right though, then the piece is practically hidden by the one you just put down. You can’t hesitate, it has to be a smooth move, but if you’re quick enough, and you’re sure enough, it’s damn near undetected.”\n\n\n\nCharles practiced the move for hours, even using it against his own father, something he felt guilty about. He could do it without hesitation, without being noticed, and he was proud of his progress, despite the trickery. He was practicing it for about two years before he got his chance like The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\nBy then, Charles was a master of not just chess but of that little sleight of hand. He hadn't dared use it at any chess tournaments, the refs were just too vigilant, as were the players, but in casual games, as well as at the park, he had become undetectable by any but the most observant. He was good enough to do it without hesitation, and when he opened his paper and saw a squib that The Great Gizmo would be at Coney Island that weekend, right before going overseas for a ten-year tour, he knew this would be his chance.\n\n\n\nThere was no fee to play against the thing this time. The Barker was still there, but he looked a little less jolly these days. He was an old, fat man who had grown sour and less jovial. He looked interested in being gone from here, in getting to where he would be paid more for the show. He told Charles to take a spot in line, and as the players took their turn, many of them people \n\nCharles had bested already, they were quickly turned away with a defeat at the hand of the golem.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo looked downright dapper as he sat down, seeing that the man had gotten him a new robe and feather for his journey. The eyes still sparkled knowingly, however, and Charles settled himself so as not to be thrown by any declarations of future knowledge this time. The pieces came out, and the game began.\n\n\n\nCharles did well, at first. He was cutting a path through The Great Gizmo's defenses, and the thing again told him they would play eight more times before the end. That was constant, it seemed, but after that, the match turned ugly. The Great Gizmo recaptured some of his pieces and set them to burning. Charles was hurting, but still doing well. He took a few more, received his next expected bit of prophecy, and then the play became barbaric. The Great Gizmo was playing very aggressively, and Charles had to maneuver himself to stay one step ahead of the thing. He became desperate, trying to get the old golem into position, and when he saw the move, he took it.\n\n\n\nHe had palmed a knight and a pawn when something unexpected happened.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo grabbed his hand, just as he had grabbed Kenny's, and it leaned down until its eyes were inches from his.\n\n\n\nIt breathed out, its breath full of terrible smoke and awful prophecy, and Charles began to choke. The smoke filled his mouth, taking his breath, and he blacked out as he fell sideways. The thing let him go as he fell, but his last image of The Great Gizmo was of his too-expressive eyes watching him with disappointment.\n\n\n\nHe had been found wanting again, and Charles wondered before passing out if there would be a fourth time.   \n\n\n\nCharles woke up three days later in the hospital, his wife rejoicing that God had brought him back to them.\n\n\n\nBy then, The Great Gizmo was on a boat to England, out of his reach.\n\n\n\nThe year after that, World War two would erupt and Charles had feared he would never get another match with the creature.\n\n\n\nThe match had begun as it always did. Charles put aside The Great Gizmo's gambits one at a time. He played brilliantly, thwarting the Golem's best offenses, and then it came time to attack. He cut The Great Gizmo to shred, his line all a tatter, and when he told him they would play eight games before the end, Charles knew he was advancing well. He had lost barely any pieces of his own, and as the thing began to set its later plans in order, he almost laughed. This was proving to be too easy.\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo and the Barker had been in Poland when it fell to the Blitzkrieg, and the Great Gizmo had dropped off the face of the earth for a while. Charles had actually enlisted after Pearl Harbor, but not for any sense of patriotism. He had a mania growing in him, and it had been growing over the years. He knew where the thing had last been, and he meant he would find the Barker and his mysterious machine. The Army was glad to have him, and his time in college made it easy to become an officer after basic training. They offered him a desk job, something in shipping, but he turned them down.\n\n\n\nIf he wanted to find The Great Gizmo, then he would have to go to war.\n\n\n\nHe had fought at Normandy, in Paris, in a hundred other skirmishes, and that was where he discovered something astounding.\n\n\n\nDespite the danger Charles put himself in, he didn't die. Charles was never more than slightly wounded, a scratch or a bruise, but sustained no lasting damage. He wondered how this could be, but then he remembered the words of The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\n“You will live far longer than you may wish to.”\n\n\n\nHe returned home after the war, but the old construct returned to America. It took a while for his contacts to get back on their feet, but eventually what he got were rumors and hearsay. He heard that Hitler had taken the thing, adding it to his collection of objects he believed to be supernatural. He heard it had been destroyed in a bombing run over Paris. He heard one of McArthur's Generals had taken it as a spoil of war, and many other unbelievable things.\n\n\n\nAfter the war, it was supposed to have been taken to Jordan, and then to Egypt, then to Russia, then to South Africa, and, finally, back to Europe, but he never could substantiate these things.\n\nAnd all the while, Charles grew older, less sturdy, but never died.\n\n\n\nHe was over one hundred years old, one hundred and six to be precise, but he could pass for a robust fifty most of the time. He had buried his wife, all three of his children, and two of his grandchildren. He had lost his youngest son to Vietnam and his oldest grandson to the Iraq war, and he was trying to keep his great-grandson from enlisting now. They all seemed to want to follow in his footsteps, but they couldn't grasp that he had done none of this for his country.\n\n\n\n\"Checkmate,\" he spat viciously as he conquered his oldest rival.\n\n\n\nHe had gone to war not for his wife, or the baby in her arms, or even the one holding her hand.\n\n\n\nHe had gone to war for this metal monstrosity and the evil prophecy it held.\n\n\n\n\"Well played,\" it intoned, and he hated the sense of pride that filled him at those words, \"You may now ask me one question, any question, and I will answer it for you. You have defeated The Great Gizmo, and now the secrets of the universe are open to you.\"\n\n\n\nSome men would have taken this chance to learn the nature of time, the identity of God, maybe even that night's lotto numbers, but there was only one question that interested Charles.\n\n\n\n\"How much longer will I live?\"\n\n\n\nThe Great Gizmo sat back a little, seeming to contemplate the question.\n\n\n\n\"You will live for as long as there is a Great Gizmo. Our lives are connected by fate, and we shall exist together until we do not.\"\n\n\n\nCharles thought about that for a long time, though he supposed he had known all along what the answer would be.\n\n\n\nThe man behind the counter looked startled when the old guy approached him and asked to buy The Great Gizmo.\n\n\n\n\"That old thing?\" He asked, not quite believing it, \"It's an antique, buddy. I picked it up in Maine hoping it would draw in some extra customers, but it never did. Thing creeps people out, it creeps me out too, if I'm being honest. I'll sell it to ya for fifteen hundred, that's what I paid for it and I'd like to get at least my money back on the damn thing.\"\n\n\n\nCharles brought out a money clip and peeled twenty hundred dollar bills. He handed them to the man, saying he would have men here to collect it in an hour.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, pal, you paid me too much. I only wanted,\"\n\n\n\n\"The rest is a bonus for finding something I have searched for my whole life.\"\n\n\n\nHe called the men he had hired to move the things and stayed there until they had it secured on the truck.\n\n\n\nCharles had a spot for it at the house, a room of other treasures he had found while looking for the old golem. The walls were fire resistant, the floor was concrete, and the ceiling was perfectly set to never fall or shift. Charles had been keeping a spot for The Great Gizmo for years, and now he would keep him, and himself, for as long as forever would last.\n\n\n\nOr at least, he reflected, for four more chess matches.\n\n\n\nWasn't that what The Great Gizmo had promised him, after all?   \n\nThe Great Gizmo"

        "selftext": "I was just looking for something to make my end-of-summer sleepover amazing.\n\n\n\nWhat I got was a sleepover that no one would ever forget.\n\n\n\nMargo, Jenny, and I had been friends for years, since Kindergarten even, and we were getting ready to start seventh grade in a few days and wanted to hold our annual slumber party. I had the pigs in a blanket made, the chips that Margo liked, the sour gummy worms for Jenny, and a huge bottle of Doctor Fizz for us to share. I was getting the movies ready when I realized that I hadn't found our favorite game yet and started hunting through the closet.\n\n\n\nWe had played Mall Madness, a game my mom had given me from when she was young, and it was a hit at any sleepover. We would shop till we drop, charge it up, and then laugh about who got the best deals and spent the least amount of money. It was great, I had probably replaced the batteries in it a dozen times or more, but I just couldn't find it anywhere. It had always been at the top of my closet, right beside my old Barbie travel case, but today it was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nI blew out in exasperation, wondering where it could be, but ultimately decided to go check the attic. It had come from the attic, so maybe Mom had put it back up there. I pulled down the ladder, glad it was still daylight so it didn't look so spooky, and went looking for Mall Madness. It was kind of a chore because Mom is something of a hoarder. Dad calls her a \"Pack Rat\" and it seems pretty fitting. She keeps everything. She had clothes from when my sister and I were little kids, she's got school art projects, she had boxes of old photos and memory books, and all kinds of things. I pushed aside a bunch of dresses and found an area dominated by old toys and games that she had saved. It was a mishmash of dolls, books, some old dollhouses, and a couple of dusty board games.\n\n\n\nI didn't find Mall Madness, but I found about seven others. Apples to Apples was for babies, Uncle Wiggly sounded kind of weird, Don't Wake Daddy was missing pieces (some of which I had lost), and Monopoly took too long. I was about to give up when I saw a black box at the bottom of the stack that I didn't think I had ever seen before. It was covered in dust, the letters barely visible, and as I pulled it out, tugging it quickly so the other boxes wouldn't fall, I wiped off the cover and read the red letter slowly, the red on black hard to read since it was so faded.\n\nMystery Man the name proclaimed, and I was about to open it to see the instructions when my mom called to let me know my friends were here and I ran downstairs to see them.\n\n\n\nI tossed the game onto my bed as I ran past, figuring we would check it out late, and we were soon all laughing and jumping as we got excited for tonight.\n\n\n\nWe ate dinner, we played hide and seek in the backyard, we hung out in my tree house, and as it started to get dark we came in to watch movies, play games, and start the rest of the evening's activities. Dad worked nights and Mom didn't really ever make us go to bed when we were having sleepovers. We usually passed out sometime around midnight, but tonight we wanted to stay up till we heard my Dad pull in from work. We wanted to see if we could stay up till dawn, just to see if we could, and we had enough snacks and sugar to manage it, we thought.\n\n\n\nBy eleven thirty we had watched two movies, eaten most of the snacks, drank half a bottle of soda, and braided each other's hair during the end of Balto. We were a little bored with movies and Jenny asked if we could play Mall Madness for a little bit. That was when I remembered the game and told them I had something different in mind tonight. The game had worked its way half under my pillow somehow and when I pulled it out, my friends Oooed and Awwed at it appreciatively.\n\n\n\nWe opened the box and found a blackboard with silver spaces, the big orange phone in the middle having an honest-to-God spin dial on it. We had cards with descriptions on them, and it felt more like we were assembling a police sketch than a dream date. We would go around the board, landing on spaces and drawing cards, and when we found a card with a number on it, we would dial the number and it would help us determine the identity of our mystery man.\n\n\n\n\"So it's a little like Dream Date, then,\" Margo said.\n\n\n\n\"Seems weird,\" Jenny said, \"Like we're hunting him or something.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at the instructions but they gave no particular instructions on the purpose for making a description of the guy. We would take turns until we had assembled our mystery man and then we would call triple 0 on the phone and give our description to the person on the other end. Somehow they would know if it was right or not and tell us we had won or tell us to try again.\n\n\n\n\"Simple enough,\" I said, and I picked up the dice and rolled first.\n\n\n\nIt was about four turns later when Jenny landed on a card that gave her a phone call. She tried to dial, but she was having some trouble until I showed her how the rotary phone worked. Mom had shown me, saying that was how they used to call people a million years ago, and once she got the number plugged in, she held the phone against her head and waited for the click. Someone came on after three rings, a weird staticy voice that I didn't much like, and whatever it told Jenny, she didn't seem to like it either. After a few minutes, she put the phone down, her hands shaking a little.\n\n\n\n\"Well?\" Margo asked, \"What did it say?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm,\" Jenny cleared her throat, clearly trying to get in control of herself, \"I'm not supposed to tell anyone. The phone man said the call was just for me.\"\n\n\n\nShe handed me the dice, her hand very sweaty and a little shaky, and we continued.\n\n\n\nIt was my turn to use the phone next, but Margo pulled out a card and laid it down. The card let her steal my phone call and I laughed a little as I stuck my tongue out at her. She dialed the number and held the phone, interested to hear what was to come. None of us thought it was real, well, Margo and I didn't, but Jenny scooted a little away as she made her call.\n\n\n\nThe voice picked up, said something quick and harsh and Margo's smile slipped off her face as she listened.\n\n\n\nHer lip was trembling as she put the phone down, and she wrote something on a piece of paper and shook her head when I tried to pass her the dice.\n\n\n\n\"The guy on the phone said to let you roll again. He said some other stuff, but I'm not supposed to say.\"\n\n\n\nI rolled again and grumbled as I landed just shy of a phone space. I wanted to hear what had them so spooked. This was a board game, ages ten and up and all that, and there was no way it could be that terrifying. We continued taking turns, the girls wanting to keep playing despite their obvious discomfort, and finally, I got my wish. I drew a card after landing on the spot and it was the phone booth, *Search the deck for a phone call card and dial the number.* I took the first one I found and dialed the number, letting it ring five times before someone picked up.\n\n\n\n*\"The Mystery Man is a blonde, about six foot tall, in a wide-brimmed hat. That's for your ears only, toots, so don't tell any of those other little bitches what I said, I'll know.\"*\n\n\n\nThat was a little weird and I put the phone down with some hesitation. I didn't think they could say things like that in a board game like this. Margo and Jenny didn't bother to ask what he'd said, and I made notes as Margo took her turn. I had a blonde card and a wide-brimmed hat card, but I didn't have one that said six feet tall. I guessed I would just have to draw for it. Meanwhile, Margo had gotten another phone call and as she listened, I saw her glance over at Jenny and the look didn't seem friendly. I didn't know what the phone guy was telling her, but it seemed to be making her mad.\n\n\n\nWe played the game for hours, and in that time, the game got worse and worse.\n\n\n\nAnytime Jenny got a phone call it nearly put her in tears.\n\n\n\nAnytime Margo got a phone call it seemed to make her angrier and angrier.\n\n\n\nI tried to take the phone from Jenny at one point, offering to take the call for her, but she shook her head and told me the phone man said she had to take it, whether she liked it or not.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Margo said, her eyes looking mean, \"She needs to take her calls just like the rest of us.\"\n\n\n\nAs the game went on, we got more clues. I learned that my Mystery Man was a six-foot-tall blonde in a wide-brimmed hat with a mustache, black pants, and a white shirt. I had most of that, but I was still missing the six-foot card and the mustache. The man on the phone had alluded to the fact that Margo would soon make her move against Jenny, the two being like dogs ready to fight, and when Margo threw down a card, it looked more like a knife toss than a friendly showing.\n\n\n\n\"White glove, I get to take one of your cards, Jenny.\"\n\n\n\nJenny nodded, holding her card out like a fan and Margo picked the fourth one, pulling it back smugly before glowering at it.  \n\n\n\n\"You switched it,\" she accused, flipping it around to show the Green Sweater card.\n\n\n\nJenny shook her head, \"Nu-uh.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, you did!\" Margo accused, \"The phone man said you were a cheater, but I didn't want to believe him at first. Looks like he was right.\"  \n\n\n\n\"I never cheated,\" Jenny said, almost crying.\n\n\n\n\"Then why wasn't this the Green Scarf card? The phone guy,\" but she brought her teeth together, hard, and it sounded like wood clacking together.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" I asked, \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing,\" Margo said, \"Doesn't matter. Just play the game.\"\n\n\n\nJenny didn't look like she wanted to continue playing, but she didn't look like she was capable of stopping either. The game would continue whether we wanted to or not, and after that, the phone calls got even weirder.\n\n\n\nI pulled a card, dialed the number, and was greeted with about ten seconds of heavy breathing before he spoke.\n\n\n\n*\"The mystery man has a long, sharp knife. He's walking down the street, turning left on Martin Drive, and will soon be there.\"*\n\n\n\nThat sent a chill through me. Martin Drive, that was two streets away. That was like an easy twenty-minute walk. What the heck was this? These weren't prerecordings. This had to be live, but that was impossible. This game was probably twenty years old at least.\n\n\n\nIt couldn't happen.\n\n\n\n\"Look,\" I said, hanging up the phone, \"let's just call this a draw. I think this is getting a little too real and,\"\n\n\n\nThe orange phone rang, and I felt my words wither in my mouth as we just sat there and looked at it. It was like watching a bomb tick down, none of us wanting to be the one to touch it. It just kept ringing, and ringing, and finally, to my surprise, Jenny reached out to pick it up. Her hand shook, her breath coming in quick gasps, and as she lifted it to her ear, I heard someone snarl something and she winced like she'd been struck.\n\n\n\nShe held the phone out for me, hand moving like someone with nerve damage, and said it as for me.\n\n\n\nI took it, held it to my ear, and said hello.\n\n\n\n*\"Whether you play the game or not, you little bitch, the Mystery Man is still coming. If none of you wins when he's coming to get all of you, but if one of you manages to win, then they might be safe. You never know. Better finish what you started.\"*   \n\n\n\nI hung up the phone, trying to keep my teeth from chattering as I told them what he had said.\n\n\n\n\"That's not true,\" Margo said at once, \"the phone guy told me that I had to beat Jenny or I'd get taken. He said Jenny was trying to win on purpose so the Mystery Man would get me.\"\n\n\n\nJenny burst into tears, \"He said that you two were trying to sacrifice me to the Mystery Man and that I deserved it. He said I was useless, just holding you two back, and I deserved to get dragged away.\"\n\n\n\nI thought about it, weighing what they had said, \"Sounds like if we all win, then he can't get us at all. We have to work together to get out of this.\"\n\n\n\nJenny shook her head, \"He said that if I told you what my Mystery Man looked like, he'd get me for sure.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me too,\" Margo said, her anger slowly turning into fear.\n\n\n\n\"Well, who cares what he says? He's coming, regardless, so we have to do something.\"\n\n\n\nSo, we started playing the game cooperatively.\n\n\n\nHelping each other proved a better strategy, and Margo soon had everything for her mystery man. Margo dialed triple zero and declared that her Mystery Man was five foot four and bald, with a hockey mask, a machete, and a white jumpsuit. A voice came from the rotary, making us all jump with its suddenness, as it reverberated around the room.\n\n\n\n*\"You have discovered your mystery man, Margo. You are safe, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nWe were still for a moment, and then Jenny reluctantly picked up the dice and kept playing. She got a card, dialed the number, and choked out a sob as the man on the phone told her about her Mystery Man.\n\n\n\n\"He's on your street,\" she said, sobbing a little, and I rolled the dice so we could get to her turn again.\n\n\n\n\"White Glove,\" I said, \"Lemme see them.\"\n\n\n\nJenny held up her card, but she started nodding at one that was five into the stack.\n\n\n\nI drew it and, sure enough, it was the mustache.\n\n\n\nNow all I needed was the six-foot tall and the knife.\n\n\n\nJenny went again, drew a card, and breathed a sigh of relief as she dialed triple zero.\n\n\n\n\"My Mystery man is Six feet tall, dark-haired, with a rope and a long coat.\"\n\n\n\nThe phone made the sound again and declared, \"*Jenny, you have discovered your Mystery Man. You are safe, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nI had picked up the dice when I heard something creak the door open downstairs. It was long and loud, like a funhouse door at the carnival. I tossed the dice, moved my piece, and drew a card. It was a phone call and I threw it away and rolled again. I moved, drew, and pumped my fist as I got the six-foot card.\n\n\n\nI was rolling again when the phone began to ring.\n\n\n\nIt barely covered the sound of a footstep on the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\n\nI let it ring, rolling and moving like a madman. I drew but it wasn't what I needed. I got another phone card and threw it away. I could hear my Mystery Man on the stairs, moving as slow as any horror movie villain. I drew the gun and cursed as I tossed it away. I drew another white glove card, but I tossed it and kept rolling and moving. I could hear him on the stairs, his boots clumping menacingly. I had to find the knife. I had to banish this Mystery Man. If I didn't, it would be my death.\n\n\n\nHe came onto the landing when the ringing phone became too much and I picked it up and put it down again. It started to ring after a few seconds and I did it again before moving my piece. I could still hear his boots in the hallway that led to my room, and they grew louder by the second.\n\nJenny and Margo were watching the door to my bedroom like it might explode, but I was focused on my task.\n\n\n\nRope, tossed.\n\n\n\n*clump clump clump*\n\n\n\nA wide-brimmed hat, tossed.\n\n\n\n*clump clump clump*\n\n\n\nHe was walking past my little sister's room now. He'd pass Mom and Dad's room after that, and then it would be down to my room at the end of the hall. What would happen if he got me? \n\n\n\nWould they even believe Margo and Jenny? Would the Mystery Man leave them alone once he got me? I didn't know but...\n\n\n\nMy heart lept into my throat.\n\n\n\nI had the knife, I was done.\n\n\n\nI dialed triple zero as something opened the door to my room.\n\n\n\nJenny and Margo gasped, sliding away from the board and as far from the door as they could get.\n\n\n\n\"My Mystery Man had blonde hair, a wide-brimmed hat, is six feet tall, has black pants and a white shirt, and a knife.\"\n\n\n\nI practically screamed it into the phone, falling forward to cover it as I expected that long, sharp knife to stab into me at any minute.\n\n\n\nI heard the tone and then heard the phone crackle out, *\"That was a close one, Heather. You're safe from your Mystery Man, for now.\"*\n\n\n\nI just lay there for a while, panting and trembling, as Margo and Jenny came to comfort me. \n\n\n\nThey told me they had seen him standing in the doorway, his blonde hair spilling beneath his hat and a sharp knife in his hand. He had raised it, took a single step, and then just disappeared into nothingness. We lay there, just kind of basking in the feeling of still being alive until I heard Dad pull into the driveway.\n\n\n\nWe had made it, we stayed up till sunrise, just like we wanted to.\n\n\n\nI went down and hugged my dad, who seemed surprised I was still awake but glad to see me and then the three of us turned in.\n\n\n\nI put Mystery Man back in the attic and have never touched it again.\n\n\n\nOne brush with death was enough for me.\n\n\n\nSo if you find a copy of your own while trolling through the thrift stores and antique malls in your area, be very careful with it.\n\n\n\nThe Mystery Man you find might not be a mystery for very long.Mystery Man"

        "selftext": "\n\nI’ve always been a night owl, working late into the evening in my home office. It was on one of these late nights, while staring out my second-floor window, that I first saw him.\n\nAt first, it seemed like a trick of the light. The man stood on the sidewalk across the street, staring directly up at me. His face was shrouded in darkness, but I could feel his eyes piercing through the glass. Chilled, I pulled the blinds down and tried to focus on my work. \n\nThe next night, he was there again. Same spot, same unyielding stare. This time, I turned off my light and peered through the blinds, hoping he would go away if he thought I wasn’t watching. But he remained, an ominous silhouette against the streetlight.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the man became a regular fixture of my nights. He never moved, never came closer. Just stood there, watching. I told my friends about him, but they laughed it off, saying it was probably a harmless prank or some weirdo passing through.\n\nOne night, I decided to confront him. Grabbing a flashlight and my phone, I stormed out of my house, adrenaline pumping. But when I reached the spot where he always stood, there was no one there. I shone my light around, half expecting him to jump out from the shadows, but the street was empty.\n\nI turned to go back inside, and that’s when I saw it. The man was now standing in my yard, directly under my office window, staring up at where I had been moments before. My heart raced as I realized he had somehow moved without making a sound. I backed away slowly, my mind racing with fear.\n\nThat night, I barely slept. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was still out there, watching. The next day, I installed security cameras around my house. At least then, I would have proof that I wasn’t imagining things.\n\nFor a few nights, he didn’t appear. I began to hope that maybe he was gone for good. But then, on the fourth night, I saw him again. This time, he was standing much closer, just at the edge of my driveway. His face was still obscured, but I could feel his gaze more intensely than ever.\n\nI checked the security footage, but to my horror, the cameras had captured nothing. The man didn’t appear on any of the recordings, as if he were a ghost or a figment of my imagination.\n\nPanic set in as I realized that I might never be rid of him. I started closing all the blinds and keeping the lights off at night, hoping he would lose interest if he couldn’t see me. But it didn’t work. No matter what I did, he was always there.\n\nOne particularly stormy night, I woke to the sound of tapping on my window. My heart pounded as I slowly approached, dread pooling in my stomach. I pulled back the curtain just enough to peek outside.\n\nThere he was, right up against the glass, his face inches from mine. For the first time, I could see his features clearly—a pale, gaunt face with hollow eyes that seemed to bore into my soul. I stumbled back, my scream lost in the thunder.\n\nThe next day, I decided I couldn’t stay there any longer. I packed my things and moved in with a friend across town, hoping distance would sever the connection. For a while, it seemed to work. I started to sleep better, and the anxiety that had plagued me began to fade.\n\nThen, one night, I glanced out my friend's window, and my blood ran cold. He was there, standing in the driveway, staring up at me with those hollow eyes. He had found me.\n\nDesperation gripped me as I realized there was no escape. The man in the window wasn’t bound by location or reason. He was a relentless shadow, a harbinger of dread that would follow me wherever I went.\n\nAnd so, each night, I watch and wait, knowing that somewhere out there, he is watching too."

        "selftext": "\n\nI've got a bit of a weird career, but it's lucrative.\n\n\nPeople often get nostalgic over old shows from their childhood and want to watch them again. The problem with that is that most times shows from before the nineties aren't well archived. These days you can go on Amazon and buy a box set of your favorite show, but it wasn't always that easy. There are whole shows that exist in little more than clips and snippets now, and some shows that have been lost to time entirely. That's where people like me come in. We pick up VHS takes from yard sales and Goodwill and all over the place and see what's on them. Most of the time it's useless, but sometimes you luck out and find a show that someone recorded that turns out to be some of that lost media.\n\n\nIf it sounds tedious that's because it is.\n\n\nIf it doesn't sound lucrative, think again. I paid eight months of rent last year off lost episodes of a certain cartoon show that I found cassettes for at a church garage sale. I paid a good chunk of my student loans off with some early-run episodes of As The World Turns a few years ago. The money is there, you just have to be willing to look for it. \n\n\nThat was how I found myself going through tapes at Goodwill on the day in question. I was looking for the usual stuff. Disney VHSs, old or obscure cartoons, and hand-labeled tapes from someone who decided to record their favorite show. Pickings were slim, and when I asked Doug, the guy who runs the Goodwill in my area, if he had any more, he got a funny look before nodding slowly. I don’t think he knew what he had, not really.\n\n\nThat look was more akin to the look of getting two birds with one stone.\n\n\n\"Come with me, maybe you can help each other out.\"\n\n\nHe took me into the sorting area and into a storage room where he had six moldy old boxes that had been haphazardly filled with old VHSs.\n\n\n\"I can't sell them, and you're the only person who comes in who wants them. I was about to throw them away, but if you want to take them with you then you can pitch the ones you don't want. I'd rather have the storage space, personally.\"\n\n\nI had to stop myself from salivating at the sight of all those tapes. What untold treasures might lie there? What lost media could I uncover on these? The possibilities were limitless, and I told him I'd take them.\n\n\n\"One thing,\" he said, bringing me up short before I noticed his grin, \"You have to load them yourself.\"\n\n\nHe laughed when I went to the truck and came back with a handcart.\n\n\nThis wasn't my first rodeo.\n\n\nI had them in the truck in two trips and paid him for the other box he had on the floor as a show of good faith.\n\n\nI moved them into the house and prepared to start rummaging. I ordered some Chinese food from Dantes and got comfy, prepared for a long night of treasure hunting. As I popped the first one into the VCR I kept hooked to the living room set for just such an occasion, I just knew I was going to find something worthwhile here amongst these dusty old tapes.\n\n\nBoy, I didn't know how right I was.\n\n\nThe VCR clicked and clacked before giving me nothing but static and the sound of plastic tape being eaten. I quickly shut it off, taking the tape out delicately as I fed the ribbon back in. This happened sometimes with older tapes, and as the spools reset I tried it again. The label said Jeopardy, but after pressing play delivered the same results twice more, I tossed it into a plastic bag I had set aside for just such an occasion and moved on to the next one. \n\n\nNot a great start but I was hoping to make up for it with the next one.\n\n\nFive tapes later I had a recording of the news from October 5, 1983, some home movies of a trip to the seashore in which a woman and a dog ran along the beach, two tapes that contained popular episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and one of those old Disney specials that used to come on sometimes where they showcased the art process and upcoming projects. The two TMNT tapes went into the bag, they had cut the commercials and the episodes were popular ones you could find anywhere, along with the Disney presentation since it had no commercials and was also well documented. I saved the news broadcast, I had a guy who liked to collect those, and the home movies too for another guy who used them to make odd little art pieces online. \n\n\nBoth tapes would probably net me less than twenty bucks so I knew I'd need to find more.\n\n\nThe next five were similar fare, and I added two more news broadcasts to the stack, a wedding video to a new stack, and two more broken tapes to the bag. The last of the two really stung because the label had read Jerry's Place, and that one was hard to come across after the accident at the studio during the second season. As such, any footage from Jerry's Place was worth cash money, and I dug it out after thinking about it so I could take it to Darrell and see if he could get anything from it. Darrell usually cleaned or fixed VHS film and his work was often worth the money.\n\n\nThe next four hours practically flew by as I watched tape after tape of home movies, cartoons, news broadcasts, game shows, and a thousand other things. Some of them I saved because they had shows I could sell. Some of them I saved because they had commercials that people would want clips of. Some of them I just saved because the footage would or could be used by someone to make something, and in this business, you never knew what somebody might pay for. For the most part, I only really ended up trashing the ones that didn't work, and I would have a full day of transferring some of these into a digital format so I could send them to people and assess their interest. \n\n\nAs the first box came up empty, I put the bag of broken tapes into it and pulled over the second box.\n\n\nRight on top of the stack, the label meticulously written, was a VHS labeled Christmas Morning. \n\n\nI picked it up and looked at it, sucking my teeth dubiously. The tape looked a little worse for wear, and it was missing one of the plastic glass windows that shows the reels. I wasn't sure it was going to work when I pushed it in, and when I hit play it made a crunchy sound that made me even less sure. I pulled it out, the tape trying to stay behind in the machine, and I figured the filament would break as I tried to put it to rights. It was a shame because kids opening gifts on Christmas morning was usually a favorite for creepy YouTube videos or adverts or other things. I wound it back up, slipping it into the VCR, and when I hit play, my expectations were very low.\n\n\nWhen it played, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\nAs it continued to play, my surprise would become far less pleasant.       \n\n\nThe static parted begrudgingly and I could see a cheery living room with a Christmas tree and a floor full of presents. There was a happily crackling fire set behind the Christmas tree and the whole scene looked very picturesque. The date on the camera informed me it was December 25th, 1982, and it seemed from the noises behind the camera that someone was very excited. As the camera wiggled a little, I heard a small voice say \"There, it's recording\" before quieting down as a man came into view. He was clearly an adult, his head hidden unbelievingly by a swoop of thin blond hair, dressed in footy pajamas like a giant child. He had put on an approximation of a kid's voice, high and wavery, and skipped happily into the scene before landing with a wump on his butt amongst the presents.\n\n\n\"Oh, goody goody. Lots of pwesents for Biwwy!\" he trumpeted.\n\n\nI couldn't help but cringe a little at what I was seeing. He sounded like someone doing a bad Tweety Bird impression, and he looked up at the camera with a gap-toothed grin as if he were making eye contact with me. It was highly unsettling, and I glanced away until I heard the ripping of paper and the happy gabble of the \"kid\". It was pretty clear that he maybe wasn't all there, and I felt bad for being so uncomfortable as some parent recorded their \"kids\" Christmas morning. It was cringy, but I didn't think there was any harm in it.  \n\n\nHe unwrapped a large stuffed dog, the fur looking incredibly soft even through the screen and hugged it happily as he laughed.\n\n\n\"Awww, thank 'ou.\" he said, and that's when I heard something that made me hit rewind. \n\n\nI had to rewind three times before I figured out that it wasn't just a distortion, but once I heard it it was impossible to unhear. It was clearly someone making a weird muffled sound out of camera range, and it sounded hurt. It reminded me of someone crying out from another room, and I wished I could isolate it so I could be sure of the origin of the sound. The man child, Billy I guessed, was making so much noise over the stuffed dog that it was hard to tell, and when he grabbed up another present, I heard the sound again followed by a muffled hushing sound.\n\n\nSomething was off here, and it had me interested. \n\n\nIt had never happened to me, but I had read some forum posts about people like me who had stumbled across odd, incriminating tapes. Sometimes it was CP or videos of murderers committing crimes, but the police usually paid money for these tapes. Sometimes certain collectors paid money for these tapes too. Either way, the date on the camera told me that the crime was long ago if it was a crime at all. I slid a fresh VHS into the other side, the side that recorded, and hit the red button. I'd just make a little copy in case I had to turn this one over to the cops.\n\n\nRent had to be paid, one way or another.\n\n\nOn-screen, the man-child had opened up a flashing police car, a large package of Hot Wheels, a few more plushies, and some books. He was ripping them open without any real joy but seemed to revel in showing them to whoever was off-screen as he thanked them for their gifts. I watched as the books went into the fire, the hardbacks blackening as the fire took them. Off-screen, I could still hear the uncomfortable noises of whoever was on the other side, and someone was clearly crying. Someone else was trying to shush them, to console them, but it wasn't working.\n\n\nThe man-child opened another gift and made a face as he discovered an expensive-looking package of make-up.\n\n\n\"Yuck! Who got me this girwy stuff?\"\n\n\nHe threw it against the wall, breaking the package and scattering the contents across the floor.\n\n\nHe reached for another one, checking the label before throwing it against the wall still wrapped. He shook the next one before breaking it against the fireplace, spilling colorful clothes from a garment box. He unwrapped another one, finding a ceramic clown which also shattered against the fireplace. Clothes, make-up, jewelry, anything he didn't like seemed to find its way into the fire or against the wall and soon the ground was littered with glass and metal and bits of things. The man-child was gleefully flying a toy plane around, surveying his mess, before tossing it against the fireplace too, and crawling off camera as he laughed.\n\n\nSomeone screamed, the sound muffled, and he returned dragging a girl with him by the ankle.\n\n\nShe couldn't have been more than fifteen or sixteen and she was dressed in a nightgown that was now displaying an embarrassing amount of skin. She was bound and gagged, her hands tied behind her back cruelly, and as he loomed over her I saw him take a knife from the floor beside the fireplace. It was a big one, almost a sword, and I could hear other muffled cries and screams from beyond the camera lens. He smiled as she wriggled and squirmed and kicked, raising the knife high so she could see it.\n\n\n\"Time to unwap my weal pwesents,\" he said, the voice making it all the more horrific. \n\n\nI suspected that I knew what he intended to do with this girl, but as I reached for the button, it appeared I was wrong. He plunged the knife down into her throat, the girl bucking and shaking as he sliced it down. It split her chest, sliding between her breasts as it slid across her stomach and into her nethers. It slipped out of her wetly, and I could see red spreading over her nightgown. She was shaking in her death throes, and a woman could be seen dragging herself into view from off-screen. She was looking at the girl with teary eyes, trying to comfort her in the worst and last moments of her life, when the man struck again. \n\n\nThe blade came down and she shuddered as he stabbed her again and again. The blood flew up to spatter the walls, sizzling into the fire as the woman bucked and shook her life away. The girl in the bloody nightgown was dead, her mother not far behind, and as he freed the blade, he looked back at whoever was left and grinned gleefully. The presents hadn't mattered at all to him. This was his gift, his Christmas Morning, and as he lept out of sight, the sounds of stabbing and tussling could be heard. Muffled screams and pleas for help could be heard behind the scenes. They were silenced just as fast, but not before they were scared indelibly onto my psyche. He spoke not a word, going straight to his work, filled his victims with holes, as the mother gave a final jerk.\n\n\nI sat there, frozen, watching it all unfold. I was powerless to turn it off now. I had to know, had to see, had to understand why, but I would get no answers. I was as powerless as the people he was killing, and when he came back into view, I flinched in surprise.\n\n\nHe was naked now, his body painted in blood, and he smiled at his handiwork before turning to grab the tree. Like the Grinch had in the old storybook, he stuffed it up the chimney. He didn't get it far, but I didn't believe he was trying to go up with it. It got stuck halfway up, and the dry limbs began to burn. The fire crept over them, the broken garbage that had been the family's Christmas began to catch as well. As the house burned, he turned to the camera and winked luridly.\n\n\n\"Mewwy Cwistmas to aww, and to aww a good night.\"\n\n\nThen he reached for the camera, and the video ended. \n\n\nI stood there staring at the static for a long time, almost expecting to see that blood, crazed face reflected behind me in the screen of my television.\n\n\nAfter a while, I finally found the strength to grab my phone and call the police.\n\n\nThey took the tape, thanking me for my diligence, and saying if it helped in the apprehension of a criminal, they would see that I got a reward.\n\n\nThe other tape I burned in the barrel out back.\n\n\nI didn't even want to touch it, but I wanted it in my house even less.\n\n\nNow I'm sitting here watching the static, trying to figure out what to do. I have five more boxes of tapes to go through, but the thought of watching them terrifies me. Every time I reached for them, I remembered how he cut that girl open like Christmas paper and stabbed her mother to death while she died feet away.\n\n\nHow many more tapes like that might be waiting for me?\n\n\nHow many more Christmas Mornings might be invaded by that ghoul in the footy pajamas?\n\n\nI don't know, but the more I think about it, the more I think it might be time to look for honest work."

        "selftext": "\n\nThe man with the wagon came every year, and his arrival was something we looked forward to when I was young.\n\n\nHe always sat up in the fountain area of the little mall in my town. He ran a little show similar to things like the Lynyrd Bearstien animatronic choir, or other such Holiday entertainment that sometimes came to small towns. I always got excited when I went to the mall and saw the colorful wooden caravan parked in the lot. I would get further excited when I saw the green tarp that he used like a stage curtain to block off his setup. It was like a herald of the season to see that green tarp, and it just didn’t feel like Christmas until I knew that the man with the funny tree was going to be there.\n\n\nI grew up in a fairly rural town, but most towns had some kind of mall in the nineteen nineties. Ours was nothing grand, one of those barely holding-on kinds of places that was extremely dependent on the JCPenney and the Burlington Coat Factory that occupied the larger spaces. In the middle, there was a food court, a couple of bookstores, some clothing stores, and a Spencer‘s Gifts that the local Bible thumpers always seem to be trying to get closed down. The Mall was the place we all used to go to hang out, a safe environment where you could go and parous the edifices of capitalism. Nothing bad could happen to you in the mall, at least that’s what we thought at the time.\n\n\nThe man in the wagon always came the week before Thanksgiving.\n\n\nI say he drove a wagon, but that doesn’t really do it justice. What he had was this large, colorful wooden house on wheels, something like an RV that was pulled by mules. It was covered in bright colors and strange symbols, and my mom told me that he had been coming into town for years. He used to set up in the Town Square from what she told me, and every few years he had some different display, though the content was always the same. When the mall opened up, he began to go there instead. It was where the people were, and the people were what he was after.\n\n\n“He used to have a manger scene, and before that, it was a bunch of snowmen, but it’s always just a platform for the singing heads.” Mom would say.\n\n\nYes, you read that, right. \n\n\nThe singing heads.\n\n\nThe tree that he used was large and seemed to be made of fiberglass, though I suppose it could’ve been something else. It was about fifteen feet high, and in sections that he would drag out of the cart to erect. Once he had the tree in place, he would push out a rolling cart with a tarp over it, and we all knew that’s where the funny heads were. You never saw where he unpacked them from, you never saw how they worked, but we all knew what they did.\n\n\nOn the first day of December, he would unveil his show.\n\n\nThe first time the curtain slid back, we would all laugh and cheer at the sight of the tree with the funny heads covering the limbs. There were fifteen in all, and they all hung from the limbs of the tree like ornaments. Each head seemed to know its part, and the songs were always expertly performed. We assumed they were robotic because when they weren’t singing, they would close their eyes and almost appear dead. There were five that sat on the bottom row, four that sat on the second row, three on the middle, two on the second row from the top, and a single head that sat on the very top of the tree like some grotesque star. \n\n\nThey sang the usual holiday fare, Frosty the Snowman, Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire, Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer, and even the religious songs that kept them in the good graces of the people who were constantly trying to get the Spencer closed. Each show lasted about an hour, and he usually did about five a day. He would post the show times on a chalkboard near the ticket booth, and in between shows he could be seen sitting on the edge of the stage and whittling.\n\n\nThe town always offered to put the man up in a hotel, thanking him for bringing some holiday cheer to the community, but he always refused and insisted on sleeping in his wagon.\n\n\nI wouldn’t want to be away from my stars for too long.” he would say with a sly wink.\n\n\nThe man and the tree, and the singing heads would stay until the day before Christmas Eve, and then they would disappear just as quickly as they had appeared.\n\n\nWe never knew where he went back to, just that he would be back on the last week of November, as he always was.\n\n\nThe man was mysterious, but the Talking Heads and the tree were the real show and the real mystery I suppose.\n\n\nThe man who had assembled the chorus was just as mysterious as they were. He was middle-aged but I suppose he could’ve been older. He wore a coal-black suit like an undertaker and had a tall, black hat that completed the mortician look. He had a cane, shiny black shoes that he had polished mirror shine, and I always remember he had the one tooth that winked when he smiled. He was always jolly, and his short white beard reminded me a little of Santa Claus. He always had candy canes for the children who came to see the tree, but there always seemed to be something a little off about him.\n\n\nEven as a kid, my attention held by the tree of singing heads, I remember, keeping a wary eye on the man as he grinded and watched the show from the ticket booth.\n\n\nIt was the same warry attention I would give people who stood a little too close to children’s playground or mumbled to themselves on park benches.\n\n\nIt was that wariness we give to people who might not be all there.\n\n\nI looked forward to the arrival of the man in his cart probably longer than I should have. The mystery of the tree and the singing heads would persist until I was nearly out of high school, though I wish now I had never found out.\n\n\nI might be happier if I had remained a mystery.\n\n\nI was seventeen and working at Hotdog on a Stick when I smiled as I saw the old man pushing his trolley towards the fountain area. He had the bottom part of the tree perched precariously on that hand truck, and I just knew that soon the mall would be full of the sound of the holidays. Carol, one of my coworkers at the stand, snorted and said she couldn’t believe they let that creepy old guy come back every year. I looked shocked, but then I remembered that Carol‘s family had only moved here two years ago. They had come up from Gladstone, a bigger town about three hours up the road, and this would only be her second year seeing the man and his caroling heads.\n\n\n“He’s not creepy,” I insisted, though I didn’t quite believe it myself, “I love his Christmas show, most people in town do.”\n\n\n“Really?” Carol asked, “How long has he been coming around? I assumed he was newish since he’s clearly trying to cash in on the whole animatronic fad.”\n\n\n“Since I was a little kid,” I told her, “He’s been coming around for at least the seventeen years that I’ve been alive, and mom said he’s been coming around longer than that.”\n\n\nCarol made a halfway interested sound at this, and we watched him make several trips back and forth to the wagon as he set up his tarp and began setting up the tree. Other people had taken notice too, and there was an air of excitement as they marked the old man's return. \n\n\nI call him the old man, but he always looked exactly the same. He could always have passed for middle-aged, he never seemed to get any larger or smaller, and other than his white beard, he never seemed to gray or wrinkle as old timers sometimes did. People watched him as he came and went, and as the top of the tree rose above the tarp, we all secretly waited for the first week of December.\n\n\nI was especially excited this year. I would have a prime seat for nearly every performance as I stood here and sold lemonade and hotdogs on sticks. I had been happy to take the job, after being let go when the Shoe Carnival closed up, and part of it was because I knew I’d be able to watch the Christmas tree and its singing heads. The man still gave me the creeps, though I had hidden it deep for as long as I could remember, but I looked forward to the show nonetheless. I couldn’t wait to see if he had added any new Christmas songs this year, and Carol likely got tired of my constant speculation.\n\n\nCarol seemed less excited but was definitely interested to see what the old guy would bring to the table this year.\n\n\nI was working the first day he opened that curtain and to my surprise, they had added not a new song, but another head. There were sixteen now, the bottom row now holding six, and it threw off some of the symmetry that had existed in the years before. The man took the stage and made a bow telling everyone he was glad to see them for another year. Then he lifted his conductor's baton and started the show. All the heads opened their eyes as if they had only been waiting for a signal, and as they broke into a rendition of \"Oh come all ye faithful,\" Carol gave a long shutter and said she didn’t know how she was going to work here for the next four weeks with all that going on.\n\n\n“Are you kidding?” I asked, “We get a front-row seat for every performance. We don’t even have to buy a ticket. It’s kind of cool.”\n\n\nShe gave me a look like I might be brain damaged, “Tell me this doesn't seem normal to you?”\n\n\n“Well yeah, it’s a yearly thing. The cart rolls in, the man sets up, and then the first day of December we hear the singing heads, just as we did the year before.”\n\n\nShe pursed her lips, like she was trying to find the most diplomatic way to say what was on her mind, and finally decided on the truth.\n\n\n“You know that nowhere else does anything like this, right?”\n\n\nI furrowed my brow, having never thought about it before.\n\n\n“I mean, they must do something like this. I’m sure there are weird little holiday activities in every town.”\n\n\n“Yeah, but nothing like this. This is just sick. Who makes robot heads that sing Christmas carols? The whole thing is like a Twilight Zone episode. I don’t know how any of you guys enjoy this.” She said, going to the back to count sticks.\n\n\nI just shook my head as some fella came up to buy a hotdog and on a stick and found my eyes wandering back to the show throughout the day.\n\n\nWe did amazing business that month, thanks in part to people coming over to get snacks before the show. The man put on five shows a day, the last one ending about ten minutes before the mall closed, and he always packed his heads back on the dolly and wheeled them out after the crowd had left. I remember wanting to go talk to him, tell him how much the show meant to me, but I couldn’t quite bring myself to. Even as an adult, at least that’s how I thought of myself, I was still a little hesitant to approach him. I remembered the way he made me feel as a kid, the polar opposite of the singing head, and always watched him shuffle back to his cart from afar.\n\n\nIt was December 21st, four days before Christmas, when I learned something about the show that would change my memories of it forever.\n\n\nCarol and I were, once again, manning the stand when a camera crew came up to talk to the man in between shows. He was preparing for the final show of the night, tickets already beginning to sell, when a lady from Channel 4 News approached the booth and asked him if they could interview for a piece they were doing on the malll. He tried to put her aside gently, saying he had a show starting in about thirty minutes, but she pestered him until he agreed to do an interview and he finally walked off with her. As we watched him leave, Carol got a strange in her eye and seemed to be planning mischief.\n\n\n“Hey,” she said suddenly, “let’s go have a closer look at those heads.”\n\n\nMy mouth came open a little bit, and I asked her if she was crazy?\n\n\nNo one got near the stage, no one. \n\n\nThe man’s demeanor was usually jolly, but anyone who tried to get close to the stage saw a different side of him come out. He could be scary if the mood took him, and those who attempted to touch or get close to his singing heads, discovered that the hard way. He had never hurt anyone, not that I had ever seen, but he definitely made them change their mind through some kind of sorcery. Even the surliest of teenagers, or the brattiest of kids quailed beneath his softly spoken words and his harsh glances, and very few people attempted to go near the stage.\n\n\n“No one goes near the stage,” I told Carol.\n\n\n“Yeah, because he’s always guarding it. He’s stepped away, so now we can go have a look.”\n\n\nShe explained it as if she was talking to a child, and I felt the same as I repeated to her that no one went near the stage.\n\n\n“Oh, come on. Aren’t you a little bit curious to know what they are and how they work? It’s got to be something with the baton, maybe some kind of advanced robotics if they can sing all those songs. I don’t see any wires from here, do you? He’s got to be some kind of skilled tinker if he’s controlling them with nothing but that cheap plastic wand. Don’t you want to see how it works?”\n\n\nI did. \n\n\nI was very curious, but it seemed wrong to look.\n\n\nIt was like, knowing how a magician did his tricks, and it might take some of the magic out of it if I knew that the rabbit had been in the hat the whole time.\n\n\n\"Oh, come on.\" she said, \"What are you, scared?\"\n\n\nShe was moving before I could answer and I just got swept up in it. I wasn't scared, not really, but I didn't want her to go by herself either. I was honestly worried that if she went alone I would never see her again, and she had become one of my best friends in the time we'd worked together. We hung out outside of work, we went to the same school together too, and I liked Carol in that way we sometimes become attached to people. I really didn't want anything to happen to her, and after tossing down a \"Back in ten minutes\" sign, I followed behind her.\n\n\nThe crowd was sparse this early, just a couple of people wanting to get good seats for the last show of the evening, and it was easy to move behind the curtain and into the shadowy area backstage. The light came in from the overheads, but the curtain still cast the bottom part of the tree in a small shadowy bank. The heads looked a little grizzly with their eyes closed, seemingly asleep, and now that I was close, they looked less magical and more creepy. He had decorated his Christmas tree with severed heads, it appeared, and now that I could look at them properly I could see that they were hanging from their own braided strands of hair. \n\n\nThey swung from the bows like hanged men and women, and Carol seemed amazed by them.\n\n\n\"Wow,\" she said, getting right up on one of the heads, \"These are amazing. Whatcha think it is? Some kind of robot or maybe some weird ventrili,\" but she never finished her thought.\n\n\nThe head, a dark-haired man with a short beard, opened his eyes and looked at her. \n\n\nThe two held the gaze of the other for a long moment, and then the head began to scream. The scream was high and terrifying, and as the other heads woke up, they too took up the scream. The sixteen heads began to keen in unison, lifting their voices to the sky as they shrieked and moaned. I could hear the crowd on the other side of the curtain, confused cries coming from the children as the adults began to call for help.\n\n\n\"Carol! We have to go.\"\n\n\nCarol couldn't hear me, though.\n\n\nCarol was screaming as the heads bellowed their fear and rage to the ceiling of our cheap mall.\n\n\nI heard someone coming, the gravely voice telling them that everything was okay and that they should return to their seats. I knew that voice, and I did not want him to catch me back here. Even at seventeen, I was still a little afraid of the man in the dark suit, and I'm ashamed to say that I ran for my life.\n\n\nI fled into the mall, hiding in a bathroom for about half an hour before finally coming back to find the performance in full swing as if nothing had happened.\n\n\nI never saw Carol again, but the man and his singing heads never came back either.\n\n\nI never knew why they stopped coming, but I was a little grateful for their absence. The memory of those screaming heads would haunt me for years to come, and I can remember waking up in a cold sweat as I remembered their open mouths and mourning faces. In my dreams, Carol was still screaming, and when she looked at me, her head would flop sideways and fall off her neck.\n\n\nIn my dreams, I couldn't run. \n\n\nAll I could do was watch.\n\n\nI hadn't thought about the Choir of Heads for many years, but I was reminded of them today.\n\n\nI have kids of my own now, six and thirteen, and I've moved away from the little podunk town I grew up in. I went to college and now I work in the library of said college. That's where I met my husband, and that's actually where he proposed to me. We've been together for fourteen years, and we couldn't be happier.\n\n\nAnyway, that's not what you're interested in, so I'll get to it. \n\n\nI had dragged the kids to a Winter Carnival that was being held at the fairground. It wasn't a huge event, just a couple of fair rides, some craft tables, and some food vendors, but as we got deeper into the event, I began to hear singing. My youngest was interested, thinking it was a local choir or something, and my oldest came along behind us like an angsty balloon. He clearly thought himself too cool for something like this, but if he wanted a ride home he knew he had better keep up with us. \n\n\nI saw the top of the tree before I saw anything else, and the sight of that head perched at the tippy top made me want to scream.  Its lips moved as it sang about a little drummer boy, and I was filled with the old fear again. My youngest wanted to get closer, thinking the heads were funny, but I scooped him up and told them both we were leaving. My youngest cried, not wanting to leave yet, but my older son was up and moving before I was. \n\n\nHe was done with the festivities and was glad to see I was too.\n\n\nI nearly side-swiped another car on my way out of the parking lot and I was off and running as my kids made various complaints in the backseat.\n\n\nThat new head would play a part in the new nightmares I would have, and for good reason.\n\n\nIt would appear that Carol had discovered the secret of those heads the hard way. \n\n\nNo one had seen her again after that, and her parents had still been looking for her when I went to college. I didn't tell the police anything and they never came to ask me. I just knew that I would get in trouble if they found out what I had been doing, and when the man and his cart had left early that year, I assumed it was a mystery I would never know the answer to.\n\n\nNow I knew better, and I suppose Carol did too.\n\n\nHer head sat atop the tree at its place of honor, singing all the old holiday classics the heads had sung every year.\n\n\nI told the kids to play as I went to my sewing room, just sitting here as I wrote this little confession of inaction.\n\n\nI have no idea what to do and I'm not sure that anyone would believe me anyway.\n\n\nSo if you see the tree of singing heads this year, just remember to keep your distance.\n\n\nOtherwise, you might be the new star of their little Christmas special."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nChris saw the drone flying away from his apartment and raised an eyebrow.\n\nHe hadn't ordered anything, certainly nothing that a drone would deliver, and he came up the stairs two at a time before his crackhead neighbors came out to steal it. Calling them crackheads might have seemed a little disparaging, but Chris had actually come home and found them smoking crack on the front porch, so he thought it more than fair. The Palm Breeze weekly rentals were far from posh, but they were the best he could afford. Chris had a dead-end job that barely paid him minimum wage and hardly worked him part-time these days. He was behind on his rent, looking at ramen noodles for dinner again, and, if he was lucky, he might get halfway through tonight's football game before they shut his cable off.\n\nHe bet that Robert was eating well, though, and breathed out angrily as he came to the top of the stairs.\n\nOf course, Robert was eating well. Robert was rich. Robert was a Doctor and not the kind from a hospital. He had a perfect wife and perfect kids and a perfect house and had everything handed to him. Robert had been the favorite ever since that damn test when he was six, and there had never been anything for Chris after that.\n\nRobert was Chris's younger brother, four years his junior, but his parents had always had a soft spot for him. Chris had always sort of been a normal kid. He played outside, watched cartoons, made games with his toys, and never excelled at anything in particular. Chris was an okay baseball player, and he had helped take his football team to state in his junior year, but his studies were never more than middle of the road. Chris was a solid C student, all of his teachers said so, and no one could find much fault with that. \n\nRobert, though, was exceptional.\n\nTheir mother had been ecstatic when she got the results of a test he'd taken in school. His grade had participated in one of those IQ test programs, and Robert had scored top of his class. The testers figured he had an IQ of around 194, and, by their mother's estimations, that made him a genius. After that, Chris found himself left by the wayside more often than not. It was hard to focus on someone who didn't seem to want to put in the effort.\n\nThe package was about the size of a shoebox, covered in black duct tape, and spray painted to a metallic black that clashed with the tape underlay. Chris picked it up, wondering what he had ordered. When did he have the money to order anything? He remembered the other night when his dinner had been a large bottle of Mad Dog 2020 and a quick trip to oblivion. He had splurged on the largest bottle he could find at the gas station, something to wash down his hotdog and off-brand chips, and it seemed that maybe he'd been doing some late-night purchasing.\n\nHe sighed as he brought it inside, looking through the app on his phone to check how much this little package had cost him. His bank account was still in the double digits, his savings barely in the single digits, so everything was normal there. He was glad that he wouldn't have to skip meals till Friday, and his curiosity was piqued as he brought the package to the table.\n\nThere was no address on the box or a return address, and he took the box cutter out of his pocket as he opened the tape. Chris expected it to spray confetti or a bad smell, the usual sort of pranks people played, but inside was another box and a note. The box inside was red, about the size of a children's shoe box, spray painted and wrapped in tape as well, and as Chris took the note out, he read over it carefully.\n\n*Hello, valued customer.*\n\n*Inside is exactly what you order, your deepest desire, and a warning. As we discussed, the item is not something to be taken lightly. It will not always grant what you expect, but it will absolutely grant your greatest desire. I've given you a chance to think about this before you proceed and a chance to turn back if you have second thoughts.* \n\n*Regards*\n\nThere was no signature at the bottom.\n\nChris read the note over a couple of times, not quite sure what he had here. There were some disreputable people in the area, people way worse than the druggies next door, and Chris really didn't want these people mad at him. He rechecked the outside of the box, hoping for an address or something, but there was still nothing there. He sat it on the table, looking at it dubiously, before taking out the red box and deciding to continue.\n\nScrew it; all they could do was kill him, right?\n\nHe cut the tape on the red box, and as he looked in, he found a green box about the size of an oatmeal box with another note.\n\n*Hello, valued customer*\n\n*If you're reading this, then you have chosen to proceed. Very well, I cannot stop you, but you have to be prepared to use it. Before you use the item, take a moment to picture the thing that is your greatest desire. Picture it, smell it, know its feel, its taste (if you can), what it sounds like, and know it as well as anyone can. Open the next box when it is in your mind and heart.*\n\n*Regards*\n\nChris looked at the red box and was glad that he had read it before waiting. What the hell was this? With every box he opened, he was more confident this was not something he had ordered. That said, he was also more sure that it was something he wanted. His greatest desire? What was his greatest desire? Money? Power? Prestige? The more he thought about it, the more he realized what he wanted.\n\nHow many nights had he lain in bed and wished for nothing so much as a button that made his brother never exist? How often had he watched his brother play the violin, show his parents a test, or talk about how well he'd done at mathletics and wanted nothing so much as to walk into traffic? It didn't help that Robert was also not afflicted with the acne or the braces that many of his peers had. He was handsome, effortlessly fit, and many of Chris's girlfriends had commented on the fact that he was so much better looking than Chris.\n\nChris knew what he wanted, but could he do it?\n\nHe opened the red box and found a yellow box about the size of a bracelet box and another note.\n\n*Hello, valued customer*\n\n*If you are reading this, then it is assumed that you have taken everything I've said to heart. You have the thing you desire in your mind and are ready to use it. Keep it in your thoughts, keep it close at heart, hold fast to your desire, and then open the yellow box.*\n\n*Regards* \n\nChris had the box half opened when a little voice attempted to assert itself in his mind. Was this okay? Despite getting all his parents' love and attention, his brother had never been anything but kind to him. He loved his big brother, even though Chris had never given him anything but hostility and indifference. How many times had he offered to give him money, not a loan but give? How often had he offered Chris a job at Applied Genetics? \"Not quite as nice as the one I have, but even our janitorial staff make a fine living wage.\" he had said, giving him a look that begged him to accept. Chris believed that the job, like the offer of money, had been an insult, if not pity. Chris wouldn't have any of it from his little brother, especially when it was his fault that he hadn't got to go to college.\n\nChris still seethed about it, burned to this day about the fact that his current state was all to do with the fact that there had been no money to send him to college.\n\nWhen Chris was a Junior in Highschool, he was offered a sports scholarship to a small college in the state. It wasn't Yale or Harvard, but it would have allowed Chris to succeed. He could have studied something, could have made more of himself than a register monkey at his local grocery store, and it was all Robert's fault that he hadn't gone. His parents had heard him out, heard his plans, and told him flatly that he would have to ride the scholarship on his own dime.\n\n\"We have to think about Robert's future. He will be going to college in two years, and he's studying some very costly things. We're going to have to save everything we have to get him there, and as much as we'd like to give you the same opportunity, your brother's studies have to come first right now. If you can pay your own way, you are more than welcome to go to college, but otherwise, I'm sorry to say we just don't have it to give.\"\n\nChris crumbled the letter in his hand as he thought about it. His brother had left for college at fifteen, quite an accomplishment, with no less than five different scholarships to help him get there. They couldn't have given him just a little so he might better his life? How could a seventeen-year-old boy hope to pay his own way through college? They would have made him put himself into crippling debt for nothing except a chance at something better. Chris hadn't even played football his senior year. He just hadn't seen the point anymore, and after graduation, he had slipped into the life he now endured.\n\nRight, bah, it was more than right.\n\nIt was time for Chris to get his.\n\nIt was time for him to get his due and his chance.\n\nHe grimaced as he opened the yellow box, a corner slicing his finger as it caught it on the way past.\n\nInside was a Blue box about the size of a ring box and another note.\n\nThe letter splotched with his blood as he opened it, the little cut bleeding slightly as he read.\n\n*Hello, valued customer*\n\n*This is your last chance to turn back. If you pack the boxes back together and place it on your doorstep, I will send my drone to collect it. There is no shame in choosing to walk away. One's greatest desire is often something no one wants once they have it. You would not be thought less of for returning this package unopened.*\n\n*If you choose to proceed, however, then close your eyes and keep the full image of your greatest desire in mind. Open the box as you visualize, and when you open the box, the desire will be fulfilled.*\n\n*Regards*\n\nChris closed his eyes, thinking of his brother as he prepared to disappear him. He could smell his cologne, old spice, hear his voice as it droned on and on, feel his handshake or one of his hugs, remember the way his voice had changed as he grew, hear his laugh when he was happy, feel his pain when he was sad, and as he thought about it, Chris stopped halfway through opening the box. Was this really what he wanted? How many times had his brother called just to see what he was doing? How many times had he paid for dinner or lunch just to see his big brother? Even as he looked back on the offers, he couldn't really believe that they had been made out of spite.\n\nHe hesitated, but as his thumb pulled free, the box lid opened, and he disappeared his brother from his mind and his heart.\n\nHe'd come too far to turn back now.\n\nSomething puffed up into his face, and he coughed as a freezing wind burnt his lips and cheeks. He could hear something. A child's laughter, a crackling fire, the smell of smoke, a child screaming in fear, the sound of a car horn, and then silence. He didn't dare open his eyes, thinking he had been sprayed with some sort of chemical, maybe even a hallucinogen, but as the seconds ticked on, he couldn't help but peek through his lids.\n\nHe was still sitting in his filthy apartment, nothing better and nothing worse.\n\nHe looked around, confused, snorting when he thought about how he'd been so taken in. He'd just wasted his time on someone's idea of a joke. Why had he thought something like this would actually work? He knew better than to believe in magic or curses or whatever this was. He let the box fall back into the larger box and went to the bathroom to wash his face.\n\nWhen he came back, his phone was ringing, and he was surprised to find it was his mother.\n\nShe never called unless she wanted to tell him about something Robert had done, and he sighed as he picked it up.\n\n\"Hi, mom.\"\n\n\"Well, don't sound so thrilled to hear from your only mother.\"\n\nChris had a seat, turning on the tv as he waited for it to warm up, \"Uh huh, how's it goin? What did Robert do now? Win the Nobel Prize? Get a raise? Cure cancer?\"\n\nShe was silent for a few seconds, and Chris had to look down at the screen to make sure he hadn't lost her.\n\n\"Who?\" she finally asked.\n\n\"Robert? My little brother? The protege?\"\n\n\"Christopher, are you on drugs? You don't have a brother. You're an only child.\"\n\nChris let that sink in, trying to dispute her but realizing that it was becoming harder to remember Robert. He was like a distant memory, something from his childhood, and the memory was getting harder and harder to bring to the forefront. The longer he sat there, the less he could recall about him, and he suspected that soon there would be nothing left.\n\n\"Right, my bad. I was thinking of something else, I guess.\"\n\nHe and his mother had a short conversation, her asking when he was bringing his laundry and inviting him to dinner, and then hung up after a bored \"I love you.\" Chris hung up and looked around his apartment once more. If his brother had never existed, then why was he still living in this shit hole? Why was he still doing so poorly if he'd gotten to go to college? He looked at the hatrack by the door and realized his apron was hanging from the hook, meaning he still worked at the grocery store. It was like…\n\nHe let his mouth slip open, the realization hitting him like a ton of bricks.\n\nIt had nothing to do with Robert.\n\nIt was him.\n\nThis was just as good as it got for him.\n\nAs he sat on the couch, reflecting on all this, he jumped as something bumped the door.\n\nHe walked quickly, wondering if it was the ghost of… Roger? Reggy? Whoever he was here for revenge or something, and was almost relieved when he saw the manilla envelope, the drone fleeing into the sky.\n\nHe brought it inside, seeing the familiar message but not liking it at all.\n\n*Dear less-than-valued thief*\n\n*You have intercepted a very important package that was not meant for you. If you haven't opened it yet, then place it on the porch and leave it for pick up. If you have, then don't worry. My associates will be there soon to exact payment.*\n\n*Less than fond regards.*\n\nChris sat on the couch, feeling the cold eels wiggling in his stomach, his mind trying to cling to the memories of his brother but unable as the fear took root.\n\nNo matter how terrible his life was, there was a silver lining.\n\nHe wouldn't be alive to suffer it much longer.\n\nThat's when he thought back to his earlier thought, realizing how wrong he had been.\n\nIf they could do something like erase a person from existence, then killing him likely wasn't the worst they could do."

        "selftext": "When I was around 4-5 my parents divorced and I had to move from Italy to Dominican Republic with my mom and my brother. We moved  in this 4 floor apartments near the national park. The apartments had like a twin structure where each had 2 entrances , one for the right side complex and another for the left ( I lived on 3rd floor left). Each apartment had an front balcony and a back balcony, each balcony had stairs to the neighborhood backyard which I was forbidden to go because that’s where all the chickens where kept in peace. \n\nAnyways, what happen to me takes place at the entrance of the apartment, there was a spiral staircase which would take you up to each apartment. I would play in this staircase with the local kids and neighborhoods games like catch and hide and seek. On the last floor of the staircase (ground floor) there was basically nothing except a broom and a mop that one of the neighbors used, leaning against the wall. Well one day while I was playing hide and seek, I went to the ground floor, but found another set of spiral stairs leading up instead of the wall that I’m used to seeing. I went up the stairs, and notice that this stairs weren’t taking me to any of the apartments in each floor, so I kept going until I reached the last floor, and weirdly, some long corridor to the other side of the apartment appeared, not only that, but this corridor’s view was my backyard full of chickens, which was weird because in my year living there I never seen a corridor in the backside of the apartments. \n\nSo I crossed the corridor and took the staircase in it to go down, I finally got back to the starting point of the game, but I noticed that the attitudes of the neighbors kids had changed with me. we where all close and now they where bullies to me instead. I went up to my apartment to tell my mom what happen, but she keeps insisting that I probably dreamed it all. \n\nTo this day I’m not sure if I’m in the place I was supposed to be in. It kills me every day."

        "selftext": "I created this account because I moved to a new place and some strange points fell out. I also use the account as a kind of diary.\nPerhaps I will notice connections or explanations when I write them down.\nIn order to keep everything relatively transparent, I will start at the age of 6. I went into foster care at the age of 6 and later moved from there to near Münster. Now I'm 17 and have found an apprenticeship near my old home and moved here, partly because the rest of my family lives here. I get on well with my mother and father, who live separately. But as I can only move into my apartment 2 months after I start my training, I'm currently living with my father because my sister lives with my mother and I fell out with her a few years ago and don't really want any more contact. I also knew before I moved in with my father that he is a messie and has endless debts. I thought I could support him a little with my training salary as I have a good degree with qualifications and don't earn too badly. As I still needed a doctor's certificate, I had to start my training 3 weeks later and in the first week I noticed the first strange things. The only store here, a Netto, was being rebuilt and was therefore closed for the whole month, which meant that I had to cycle to the next town to do my shopping. The first thing I noticed was the apparent lack of teenagers or young people in general. You only see people aged 60-80 here. Sometimes I see teenagers, but they are gone as quickly as they were there, which gives me the feeling of complete loneliness. I am a passionate stoner and so I go out almost every evening to smoke, but also to get to know this village more. I usually just walk down a street and turn a few corners I haven't been to yet. At night, no not at night in the evening, you don't see anyone after 21:00. My walks are very quiet apart from talking to my girlfriend on the phone although the connection drops every 10 minutes or so because the network and internet in general is terrible here. and I really don't see a soul almost every evening which feels like I'm alone, no, that's how it is. I am alone every evening. Yesterday I stayed out longer and since I have one of those e-bikes I went to the next bigger town. It takes about 45 minutes by bike and at 02:00 I decided to ride back because there was nothing going on there either. It was about 23 degrees so not cold but quite pleasant. However, it suddenly got so cold that I had to put on my jacket. I noticed this behavior more often on the way to this village. The village seems to be cool, cold and lifeless and the many old people, 4 cemeteries and the fact that there is not a soul out here after 21:00 confirm this. When I once met young people here and they asked if there was still room at my bench because I was smoking, we got talking. It was funny because all three of them knew my name and at the time I thought that it must be because of the village, because it must have been told around everywhere. We got talking and then I said to them: \"there's nothing going on here, hardly anyone our age lives here either, right?\" to which he just said: \"they live here, but they're all awake\". I had to think about what he meant and then asked where everyone was, he just said that he didn't know. I also asked him where he always was, as it was the first time I had seen him. He said that he was here quite often and that he had heard a lot about me. There were also two other boys with whom I didn't really talk as they showed little interest, but all three said that they knew me from elementary school. That confused me, and it still does, because I can't even remember a bit about them. I can't even remember which school I went to here. That bothers me because how, HOW would they know it's me? After almost 12 years they recognize me? I can't imagine that, we were kids. Besides, I was at school here for a year at most, which makes it even less likely that they would recognize me. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but it all seems so strange here. Where are all the people? Well, I'll have to go out again soon to get some new weed. I'll post all further events here and respond to your questions and answers in my free time."

        "selftext": "Do you still go to garage sales? I love garage sales. I've always walked around my neighborhood looking for garage sales - ever since I was young. I used to hold my Mema's hand, and she'd let me look at everything; look don't touch.\n\nMost garage sales sell the same things, odd decorations, baby clothes, board games with missing pieces and VCR tapes are so common I don't even see that stuff. Assorted collections of knickknacks, tchotchkes, frou-frous, bottles and boomers don't catch my eye, perfectly arranged and dusted every time, shimmering in the cool weather chosen for the yard display.\n\nI see the tangled mess of electronics and my eyes scan them for useful scrap. I look at the broken Radio Shack devices and old-school RC. I buy walkie-talkies that have no partner. I count out my change for pairs of leaky rechargeable batteries. I walk away with well-used kits for learning how to wire lights. A Night Bright with a few panels missing is my treasure.\n\nWhen it's Saturday and the sun is shining I hop on my scooter and put on my cracked shades and my fingerless gloves and play Macklemore's Thrift Shop as I roll through the good neighborhood and the bad ones too. I stop at every lemonade stand, that's how I stay hydrated. I stop at every yard sale, every sidewalk sale and every block party I can find. I find things lost to time.\n\nThen came the holy grail, or so I thought. I just stared at the 3D printer with its cracked glass siding and angled gantry. Rolls of filament hung from it like King Tutankhamun's wrappings. Half of a shipwreck lay melted on its bed and the extruder was pointing at it in a timeless pose saying:\n\n\"Look what I made, bruh! Gonna buy me? I'm only eighty dollars.\"\n\nI nodded and spoke to it out loud, \"I'm going to buy you, but I've only got Jackson, gotta go to the ATM.\"\n\nThe wiry old gnome who was selling it stared rheumily at me as I walked with a slight skip toward him and his little metal change box. I held out the twenty and pointed at the 3D printer.\n\n\"Will you hold that for me, if I give you twenty now?\"\n\nHe nodded and took my money and slipped it into a slot on his metal box, freeing one had from how he was holding it clutched in his lap defensively. \"I close up at three. But I'll leave it out fer ya. Just put the money into my mail slot.\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\" I agreed. I offered him my hand so we could shake on it and he smiled toothlessly and we had ourselves a bargain.\n\n\"Just one thing, though, the slicers don't work with this. Gotta use the helmet. And one more thing, never give it a bad dream, could be disastrous. You don't have bad dreams, do you?\"\n\n\"Uh, no.\" I felt weird but I told him it was safe with me - no bad dreams.\n\nI took my scooter to the ATM and got out some cash and went back. By the time I had got there it was a quarter past three already and sure enough he had closed up shop for the day. Everything was gone except my 3D printer sitting next to an oil stain on the weedy driveway. I walked past it to the front door of his hovel and pushed the money through the mail slot as agreed.\n\nThen I went to claim my prize, loading it into the basket of my scooter and rolling away with a crazy grin on my face. I thought I had the biggest score of my life, I thought it was charmed. I was so sure that from now on, life was going to be perfect.\n\nI had looked at it already for a brand name or a serial number and found only some odd runic symbols. I'd thought it was some kind of foreign manufacture. When I got home I went on YouTube on my phone and watched all the unboxing videos for 3D printers, trying to figure out which one I had. After a while I gave up on trying to guess and started fixing it up to use it.\n\nI had a pretty good idea how to get it started, using the dial to turn it on, and when I did it just sat there humming idly, making a kind of jagged purring noise. There was no USB slot, no disk, no input screen - nothing. The only input seemed to be an odd-looking hat with lots of wires wrapped together and plugged into the input for the gantry and extruder.\n\nSlowly, with a weird feeling, I put the control helmet on. I stared at the half-melted shipwreck. It was supposed-to-be that default tugboat toy that every printer knows how to make. It looked tired and ruined and somehow perilous. I imagined what it was supposed to look like and as I watched, concentrating, the bed started swinging, the gantry adjusted itself and the extruder went to work, unspooling the blue filament to make repairs.\n\nIt hovered in place, moving where I wanted it to go, needing no support structure or coordinate lists. Instead, it just worked with the model already on the bed, caressing it and squirting all over it until it started to look, well, fixed. Somehow it had not only fixed the toy, but it had done so just by my thoughts alone. I was stunned.\n\nI took off the apparatus and started pacing, completely bewildered. This was no ordinary 3D printer, I realized. It was something entirely different. I ate some ramen and went to bed, dreaming of all the things I could dream up and make. I was going to need more filament - a lot more.\n\nI went to the library on Monday and got online so that I could try and find out more about it. The sea of all of humankind's knowledge didn't have a single mention of such a device anywhere I could find. Exhausted, I went home and sat and stared at it.\n\nThe filament I had ordered arrived and I went and added it to the roll-o-dex of empty spools, noticing it could take thirteen of them at a time. I wondered if that could be a way to figure out what I had, but no longer really cared. I just wanted to play with it.\n\nThe first thing I did was complete my Warhammer 30K collection, just by reading a Workshop catalog and imagining each figure I wanted. I was laughing by the end of it. Board games with missing pieces were already beneath my level. I wanted more.\n\nI made Mandalorian armor, Halo helmets and telescoping lightsabers. I crafted My Little Pony models with rainbow manes and tails that looked like fiber. I picked it up and found it indistinguishable from something bought in a toy store. Amazed I wondered what else it could make.\n\nAll night I was sitting there making things with moving parts, after realizing my 3D printer had no conceivable limitations. It worked at lightning speed, making things that I knew should take hours or days in just seconds or minutes. It skipped steps, needing no structure, intuitively working with my mind to make anything I wanted.\n\nAs I sat there, the filament I'd ordered running low, I began to nod off. I'd sat there for nearly eighteen hours making a pile of things. My mind and body were tired, and I should have turned it off and gotten some rest.\n\nI don't normally remember my dreams.\n\nWhen I woke up, something was wrong. I was lying on the floor and there was smoke and sparks coming out of my 3D printer. I got the spray can of fire away from my kitchen and emptied it. Then I stared at what it had made.\n\nAt first, I felt only a vague chill, my flesh creeping into goosebumps. I just looked at the awfulness knowing it somehow, from some deep part of my mind. It was the idol of some ancestral echo, something in all of us, some kind of hideous thing from before we existed, something at the root of all that is wrong and vile.\n\nI felt sick, as I stared at it. I would describe the nightmare on the bed, but it was like a brown stain, a nasty little leftover of pure evil. It was made with a blend of all the colorful filament, braided and melted and oozing together into a purplish--beige color, a kind of slimy brown, but not a good kind. No, this was unlike any color I'd every seen. It was wrong, unnatural and drove a spike of icy fear into my heart, just from looking at it.\n\nThe toilet hugged me and took my sickness like a kindness. I flushed it, noticing how it was a cleaner and healthier shade that the color of the awful thing that should not be. It occurred to me I should flush the idol, but I worried it wouldn't fit. Instead, I made a fire in a coffee tin and went to go drop it in, hoping to burn it. As I approached the 3D printer I felt a new terror.\n\nWhatever it was it had grown, somehow, and changed shape, as though it were alive in some way. I didn't want to touch it so I took up a knife from the kitchen and used it to pry it from the bed, popping it off onto the floor. There it rolled or wiggled or whatever it was doing, but all the way into the dark corner behind my old couch.\n\nI nervously walked towards it, knife raised defensively, sweat on my brow. Had it actually moved? I was already wondering if it had. I pulled the couch away and didn't see it. I leaned down, slowly, and looked.\n\n\"There you are.\" I said and tried to fish it out from where it was caught under the couch, using the blade of the knife. My efforts only pushed it further back. I felt really weird, and scared, as though it was trying to stay in the darkness.\n\nI lifted the couch and moved it off of it, and then it started to roll back into its black sanctuary. \"Oh Hell no!\" I shouted and took the knife and stabbed at it, chipping the hardwood floor and then sticking it, the blade getting the tip bent on the supposedly soft filament. It emitted a kind of chittering scowling noise and escaped the blade's bite to retreat quickly back under my couch.\n\nI had jumped up, dropping the knife, breathing hard and eyes wide, staring where it had gone. I was so scared I just stood there for a few minutes. I looked to the open door where my tin can fire was burning low. Then I looked back at the 3D printer.\n\nIf it could make such a monstrous creature, perhaps it could make something to protect me. I went to it and put on the helmet one last time. I imagined its counterpart, a warrior of the same size, strong enough to use the kitchen knife and take that thing to the flames. I concentrated, using the link between me and the machine to create the enemy of my enemy.\n\nWhen the model was born it saluted me. I blinked in surprise as it leaped to the floor and ran for the blade, just as I had intended. With trepidation, I watched, as it brandished the knife and went under the couch, into the darkness.\n\nWith horror I listened as they shrieked and danced in the darkness under there. Then, wounded and victorious, the slayer dragged the awful squirming thing from where it had tried to hide, and into the light of day. They crossed the floor to the flames, as my heart beat so fast I thought I could die of fright.\n\nMy defender lifted its opponent overhead and then jumped together with it into the flames, which rose around them as they melted, shrieking horribly. When it was over I looked at the 3D printer where it smoldered and smoked, the gantry falling off of it to the floor and the filaments wildly unspooling. The bed cracked and fell into two pieces and the whole thing was just a fried mess of tangled wires. Even the helmet, which I had thankfully removed, was sizzling and ruined.\n\nI sat down on my couch where it remained at an odd angle in the middle of my studio. I started to cry in relief and from the acrid smoke. When I felt it was truly over I lay down and rested.\n\nWhen Saturday came around, I took that weekend off. It took me some time to get over what had happened, and to live with the ordeal I had experienced. I'd had a 3D printer, one with unique properties, and I'll never know where it came from. I wasn't going to go back and ask about it. He'd warned me not to give it a bad dream. I sighed, as I realized the only way to fully recover was to get back to what I love doing.\n\nMema would be proud of me, the way I got back into the garage sale game after such a fright.\n\nIt wasn't until the end of the month, though, that I finally got back on my scooter. I had a couple Hamiltons and a Lincoln. I put on my headphones and started up Thrift Store.\n\nI rode out of my neighborhood, looking for the next sweet bargain."

        "selftext": "\"And when she came out of the bathroom, her entire class was gone. The third-grade class of 77 was never seen again, but they say, sometimes, you can still hear laughter in the woods outside the,\"\n\nThe door opened and we all covered our eyes as Reggy grinned in at us.\n\n\"I knew you guys would be telling stories again. You should have waited.\"\n\nBecky sighed, Randal chuffed unhappily, and I tried to smile as I told Reggy to close the door before someone saw him. We were in the old equipment storage by the play field, and if an adult saw us they would make us get out.\n\nWe liked to tell scary stories, and the scarier the locale, the better. The old equipment shed had been unanimously decided upon because it was A. home to a lot of creepy crawlies, and B. Didn't let in a lot of light. We had to keep finding new places to tell stories because the ones we had got old pretty quickly. You can only tell stories in a place for so long before it stops being scary, but sometimes it was because the teachers chased us out. The third reason was stepping in right now and grinning like a shot fox at us.\n\nReggy, the weird kid of PS 24, had earned his title honestly. It wasn't just because he was overweight to the point of being a blob, and it wasn't just because his hair was always full of thick, gross-looking dandruff. It wasn't just because his Dad was the school janitor and seemed to love the job, or because he ate sauerkraut and onion sandwiches for lunch. The reason was that Reggy just emanated an aura of unsettledness. I got the feeling about him that I got about certain adults or dogs, the ones your parents tell you to stay away from.\n\nReggy had a feeling of danger, of not rightness about him, and it made me uneasy.\n\nIt didn't help that he had adopted us as his \"best friends\" this year. Becky, Randal, and I had been friends since Kindergarten, but we had managed to avoid getting too close to Reggy. That had lasted until fourth grade when we were in Mr. Novak's class together. Reggy had decided that we were his best friends, he didn't have any regular friends, and he adopted us as His. This led to a year of smelling his sandwiches at lunch, having him follow us on our playground games, and listening to his wheezy resting breaths as he sat in our pod in class.\n\nWe had hoped we would be rid of him at the end of the year, but when our parents had signed us up for Summer School Care, a kind of after-school care during the summer, we had groaned as Reggy came in and saw us. He explained that the school had agreed to let him attend for free if his Daddy worked through the summer, and we all prayed that he would be in a different fifth-grade class than us when the new year rolled around.\n\n\"Well, since you're already telling stories, I've got a good one.\" Reggy said, \"It's the tale of the skinned raccoon.\"\n\nReggy started to lay out this story about a skinned raccoon that he had seen one evening while his Dad worked late, and we all tried to pretend that it wasn't the most gruesome thing we had ever heard. The way he described the raccoon made me think he had not only really seen it, but that he had probably skinned it himself. He said it had left little red footprints on the floor as it walked away, and his father had been angry when he found them.\n\n\"We followed them all the way to the woods,\" he told us, \"but we never did find the raccoon.\"\n\nWe all made the appropriately scared noises, but I think we were all just hoping he would let us move on.  \n\nWhen Mrs. Simmon pushed the door open a moment later, telling us this was off-limits and we needed to leave, it was almost a relief.\n\nWe left the shed, trying to kind of lose Reggy as we did, but we knew he'd find us again.\n\nIt was impossible to hide from Reggy, he knew everywhere and everything about the school and all the hidden little nooks and crannies. His Dad had keys to any door in the school, and Reggy often borrowed some of them and got into places he shouldn't. His Dad always covered for him, for some reason, so he never got in any real trouble. It's weird, it was like his Dad was scared of him sometimes, but he was a grown-up and there was no reason he should have been afraid of him.\n\nAs we left the shed, running into the sunshine of a triple-digit day, Reggy said something that caught my interest.\n\n\"That's a shame, I was going to tell you guys about how I saw the missing kids a few nights ago.\"\n\nThe missing kids!\n\nThat was a big topic of discussion these days.\n\nLast year, four kids had gone missing from PS 24, a first grader, Marry Edwards, A third grader, George Tate, a Kindergartener, Savanaha Marcus, and a Fifth grader, Robbie Fust. They had come to school and then just never left. The cameras at the school left a lot to be desired, that's what my Dad said, and they hadn't seen the kids leave school by any of the other exits either. My Dad works for the police department and he told me I needed to be extra safe until they found whoever was doing this. They suspected a teacher, but the question was how would they get the kids out? If they were hidden in the school somewhere then they would have found them by now, they had searched the school a bunch. The disappearance hung around the schools like ghosts, and it sounded like the teachers were afraid that they might lose their jobs if it kept happening.\n\nI thought about what he had said until after lunch and decided I would just have to ask him.\n\nWe were playing outside, the day a little cooler now that the sun was heading towards down, and Reggy was leaning against the fence and watching people as he often did. Reggy liked to just sit there and look at people, watching them as they went past, but he didn't makeup stories about them or anything. He just watched them like the animals in the zoo watched fat children, and it was really weird.\n\n\"So, Reggy,\" I said, and Becky and Randal looked surprised since we never really talked to him and just accepted when he talked at us, \"What did you mean that you were going to tell us about the missing kids?\"\n\nReggy turned his gaze away from a first grader who was chasing a ball with some effort, and his grin was downright predatory, \"Oh yeah. I saw them the other night when Dad was working late.\"\n\n\"Like, you saw them saw them?\" I said, \"Like you know where they are?\"\n\n\"Well yeah,\" Reggy said, \"They're under the school.\"\n\nI looked at Becky and Randal, the two of them now as invested as I was, \"Why haven't you told anyone?\"\n\nReggy shrugged, \"No one asked.\"\n\nI could have smacked myself in the forehead, \"Well, can you take us there?\"\n\nReggy was already grinning like a creepypasta monster, but I saw a glimmer pass over his eye, and I should have known to take it back. He wanted to show us, he wanted us to come with him, and I suddenly didn't want to go. But, it didn't really matter if I did or not. If there was a chance I could help my Dad and find those kids, I wanted to. Dad was worried about losing his job too if they didn't find someone, and I didn't want that to happen.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll show you right now. Come on.\"\n\nReggy looked over at Mrs. Simmon and Ms. Gaie to make sure they weren't paying attention and the four of us headed towards the school. Reggy led us into a side door, through the third-grade hallway, and to the middle of the school to an area called The Square. The Square has been a part of PS 24 since it was built back in the seventies. It's an area of grass with a couple of small trees growing there. How the roots don't mess up the school, I don't know, but it's a place that lots of kids usually go to between classes. There's a utility building in the middle of it and that was where Reggy took us. He pulled a long key out of his shorts pocket and unlocked the door, ushering us into the little building before closing us into total darkness.\n\nThen he pulled the chain on a light hanging from the ceiling and we were left looking around a small square room of tools and other implements.\n\n\"There's no one in here,\" Becky said, looking around before looking back at Reggy with a scared look.\n\n\"Well ya,\" Reggy said, grabbing an edge of what turned out to be a carpet, \"\"Otherwise they would have found them by now.\"He pulled the carpet back and revealed a hatch in the floor. It was flush against the ground, with no wheel or handle to poke out, and if you didn't know it was there you would never see it under the rug. Reggy squeezed a pair of handles and pulled the hatch up to reveal a ladder that led down into the earth. Reggy started climbing down like he'd done it a thousand times before, and when he saw we weren't following him, he asked if we were coming.\n\n\"They're down here. If you want to see them, then you'll have to come down,\" he said, making his way down again as if the matter was settled.\n\nI looked at Randal, but he just shook his head and went for the door, \"No way, man. This is way too weird for me.\"\n\nHe put a hand on the knob, but when he turned it, the door was locked. I went to look for the flip lock that would let us out, but both sides of the knob had a keyhole. I had never seen anything like this, and I realized that Reggy had the only key to the door. We were locked in here with him, for better or worse, and we would need him to let us out too.\n\nI looked at the hole and figured it beat being stuck in here.\n\nAt least we might find another way out if we went down.\n\nWe descended the ladder slowly, the darkness thick around us. I tried turning the light on my watch on to see a little, but it didn't provide much light. We spread out, trying to find a switch, and when the lights suddenly came on I jumped. We were in a big room, like a storage unit, and it stretched the length of the grass area above us. The ceiling was metal, the walls were metal, the floor was concrete, and the place was full of boxes. They were stacked up to the ceiling in some places, and I wondered what this place had been before it was just used to store things.\n\nWe grouped up, moving around as we checked the room, and I saw something speckled on the floor. It looked like someone had spilled juice or maybe paint, and as we came around a big stack of boxes, I saw another door. This one wasn't locked and as it came open we saw that it led down a long hallway that went further underground.\n\n\"What is this place, anyway?\" Becky asked, sounding a little scared as we followed the tunnel.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Randal said, \"But my mom told me that when she used to go here, back in the early eighties, people used to talk about there being bomb shelters or something under the school. She never saw them, but she said that was something the kids told scary stories about.\"\n\n\"You think that what these are?\" I asked, seeing a door coming up on our left.\n\nRandal shrugged, \"Maybe. I guess it would make sense for it to be in the very middle of the school.\"\n\nWe tried the door, but it was locked tight. The next three were also locked, but the fifth door opened pretty easily and held what we were looking for. Well, not exactly what we were looking for, but we found the missing kids.\n\nThe room had been some kind of work room that had been turned into just another storage room. The boxes the kids were lying on were drenched in blood. They were dead, thankfully. If they hadn't been, they would have been screaming. They were naked, their clothes lying in rags, and someone had been very busy. Their arms and legs had been removed, the bones broken cruelly. Their stomachs had been opened, their entrails hanging around them like snakes, and a few of them were missing eyes. The little girl, Mary, I thought, had her jaw pulled off and her tongue was missing. Becky started throwing up, Randal sounded like he wanted to scream, and when someone started laughing I knew we'd stumbled into a trap.\n\nIt was Reggy, his bulk blocking the door. He had a knife, the long kind you’d find in a kitchen, and he was grinning like a creep again. He was just standing there, not trying to come after us, and it was clear that he realized, like we did, that we weren't going anywhere.\n\n\"Looks like you found the lost kids. Guess it's time to add three more to my little collection.\"\n\n\"Come on, Reggy,\" I said, trying to talk our way around him, \"This isn't funny. You got us pretty good with these Halloween decorations, but enough is enough. You win, just let us out so we can,\"\n\nWhen he slashed me across the chest, slicing a long red line that split my t-shirt and the skin beneath, I hissed in pain and stumbled back.\n\n\"There's no getting out now. You're staying here forever. I meant to get you all before school ended, but there was just never a good opportunity. Now, we can be friends forever; all eight of us.\"\n\nI was scared, but Randal had clearly gone well past scared. He screamed like a cat that's been stepped on and ran at Reggy, shoving him as the bigger boy stabbed him in the shoulder. Even though he'd got him, Reggy was still put off balance. He fell into some boxes and we scattered. Randal had gone back the way he came, Becky running behind him, but I knew there was no way out that way. I went left, running into the unknown, and when someone roared like a wounded beast behind me, I charged heedlessly.\n\nI don't know how long I ran, I don't know how far I ran, but when I slammed into a ladder hard enough to make my eyes blur, I shook myself as I tried to climb it. I couldn't let him catch me. If he caught me, I'd be dead. I climbed and climbed and climbed and when I got to the top I pushed at the hatch and almost screamed when it wouldn't move.\n\nI pushed and pushed, getting a little bit of give but it always came back down again. I couldn't make it budge, not even a little bit, and as I shoved at it, I started hearing something down the tunnel behind me. It wasn't loud, not like someone running, but it was feet coming up the concrete.\n\nI screamed and shoved at the hatch, feeling it give but not open. I squinted as something fell onto my face, dirt or something, and I had to brace my back against the wall so I could use both hands. I got brief flashes of light as I shoved, just the slight glimmer from the edges, and when I heard the laughter from the bottom of the ladder, I kept shoving, praying to God to help me.\n\n\"Found you!\" Reggy sing-songed putting his foot on the bottom rung of the ladder, \"You might as well just come down. That hatch doesn't open. I don't know where it comes out at, but it's not going to help you.\"  \n\nHe started climbing and I felt like crying as I shoved at the hatch. My arms were hurting almost as badly as my chest, and I was afraid that he would get me before I got the hatch open. He would cut my legs and I would fall down the ladder. Then he could do whatever he wanted, probably drag me back to his little room and finish me off. I shoved and shoved, yelling for help as he got closer and closer. He was climbing slow on purpose, really stretching it out, and his words were muffled by the knife he had clamped in his teeth.\n\n\"Shcream all you loik. No one ish coming to help,\" but we both squinted when the hatch came slowly open and I saw the faces of about seven or eight kids I recognized from the program. They helped me out, yelling for a teacher as Reggy retreated down the ladder. They had seen him, though. They knew he was down there, and as the teachers came running, I was lying on the grass and breathing heavily.\n\nI was in a corner of the field, the back corner by the utility shed, and the kids had been playing kickball when they heard a loud shrieking sound from that direction. It was the hinges on the door, long ago grown over with grass and covered with dirt. They came over and saw it opening and closing, and when they heard me yelling they came to help pull it open. The group of them had managed to fling it open, and as Mrs. Simmon came running to see what they were talking about, I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nI told them what had happened, told them how Becky and Randal were still down there, and Mrs. Simmon sent someone to call the police, but wouldn't go down there herself.\n\n\"If what you're saying is true then it would be dangerous for us to go down there until the police get here.\"\n\nThey came pretty quick, my Dad with them, and I told them the story again and begged them to save my friends before he hurt them. They went down the ladder, guns drawn and flashlights out, and my Dad and another officer told me to take them to the shed we'd gone in through. I took him there, but the door was standing open and I knew Reggy had fled. Dad went down the ladder and, to my relief, came up with Becky and Randal. They were scared but unharmed. They told us how Reggy had come running for the front door and climbed up while they hid behind some boxes. They said he hadn't even noticed them as he ran, and he seemed pretty scared.\n\nThe police took the bodies out in bags, and the whole place was covered in tape. They got Reggy's Dad too, and he told them how he had known there was something off about his son, but hadn't known he was that off. \"Sometimes I was afraid to sleep with him in the same house,\" he told them, \"I know it's not right to be afraid of your kid, but I was really afraid that he would kill me one night.\" The police decided he hadn't had anything to do with it, though I hear the school fired him for knowingly letting Reggy take his keys to get into restricted areas.\n\nAs for Reggy, no one knows what happened to him.\n\nWherever he ran to, he was never seen again.\n\nNow the ghost stories around school are all about Reggy and how he's just waiting for his next chance to kill more kids.\n\nIf they'd been down in those tunnels that day, if they had stood face to face with the psycho while he contemplated killing us, they might not be so quick to tell stories about him."

        "selftext": "I don't know if I should reveal this, but I've kept this dark secret for so long, I can take it no more. Humanity should know. I'll probably be gone tomorrow if you know what I'm talking about, but what does it matter, my body can barely keep up anyway.\n\nSo here goes..\n\nSince I was a child, I had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. When I was selected to be part of the team behind \"Project Nyx,\" I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Our mission was simple but groundbreaking - to observe what was inside a black hole for the first time.\n\nMe and my space fellas woke up from our cryogenic sleep as the spacecraft approached the black hole. I still clearly remember how\neveryone on the team was excited, but also nervous. We knew that this was uncharted territory, and anything could happen.\n\nWe positioned ourselves at a safe distance from the Event Horizon, preparing for the experiment. Each of us was at our designated station, ready to carry out Project Nyx. The pressure was mounting, but we kept our focus on the task at hand.\n\nThe experiment worked as follows: the ship would launch a concentrated beam of light, which would enter the black hole. According to our calculations, 58% of the concentrated light would manage to leave and return to the ship. It was a risky maneuver, but it was the only way to get a glimpse of what was inside the black hole.\n\nWhen we initiated the experiment, there was a moment of tension and suspense, as we waited for the results. Then suddenly, the monitor flickered to life, and we saw something incredible. The data showed that the beam of light had managed to penetrate and miraculously escape the black hole, and we could see what was inside.\n\nIt was a breathtaking sight - a swirling mass of matter and energy, moving in a seemingly chaotic dance. The colors were vibrant and otherworldly, like nothing we had ever seen before. As we processed the data, we knew that we had made history.\n\n\"Project Nyx\" had been a success, and we had unlocked the secrets of a black hole. \n\nOr so we think.\n\nThe monitor started processing more data again, there was something else there, alive. \n\nDeep, inside the black hole's heart, resides a creature of massive size, something so hideous and terrifying, that to this day I can't forget. \n\nI don't know what the exact shape of that thing was like, because as I said before, almost half the amount of concentrated light can't overcome gravitational force. But I'm sure I saw on the monitor its many tenyacles writhing and slithering and what can only be several red eyes glowing with intensity.\n\nAt first, we are in disbelief. How could anything, let alone a creature, survive inside a black hole?This could mean that... all black holes had one of these things in there?\n\nWell, fortunately that massive being seemed to be trapped inside, unable to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nMe and the whole team were both excited and terrified by our discovery. On one hand, we had made an incredible scientific breakthrough that would change the way we thought about the universe. On the other hand, we had also discovered something that could potentially pose a danger to life as we know it.\n\nSo we decided to leave the space beast where it was and head back home.\n\nNow, if my memory serves me right, according to Stephen Hawking's, theory quantum fluctuations in spacetime allow particles to be constantly created and destroyed. When one of these particles appears on the edge of a black hole's event horizon, it can be sucked in by the strong gravitational pull and disappear into the black hole, while its opposite particle escapes into outer space. This process of emitting particles, known as Hawking radiation, causes the black hole to lose energy.\n\nYou probably didn't understand a word.\n\nWell, what I mean is that the black hole will shrink and shrink until, one day, it will disappear.\n\nAnd I fear, that when that day comes, the Leviathan will break free."

        "selftext": "I Almost Became the Clown's Next Victim*\n\nIt was a chilly October night when my friends convinced me to join them at the local haunted house, known for its terrifying clowns. We were filled with adrenaline and laughter as we entered, but the fun quickly morphed into dread. Just around the corner, I heard a maniacal laugh followed by a rustling sound. Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped away from the group, drawn toward the sound like a moth to a flame.\n\nAs I wandered deeper into the attraction, I stumbled upon an eerily quiet room, filled with creepy clown memorabilia. Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I spun around to find myself face-to-face with a towering figure in a grotesque clown costume, complete with a painted face and a twisted grin. My heart raced as the masked clown took a step forward, brandishing a gleaming knife. Panic surged through me as I realized this wasn’t just part of the show; this was real.\n\nIn a moment of pure instinct, I bolted in the opposite direction, my heart pounding in my ears. I could hear the clown's laughter echoing behind me, a chilling reminder of how close I was to becoming the next victim. I stumbled through the dark hallways, desperately searching for a way out while keeping the sound of his footsteps at bay. I could feel the cold sweat trickling down my back, and my breath came in frantic gasps.\n\nJust when I thought I could escape, I found myself cornered in a narrow hallway, the clown looming closer, the glint of his knife catching the dim light. Fear gripped me as I glanced around for something—anything—that could help. Spotting an old fire extinguisher, I grabbed it and aimed it at the maniac, pulling the trigger. The freezing foam exploded into the air, obscuring everything in white. Seizing the moment, I sprinted past the confused killer and burst through a back exit.\n\nI finally burst out into the cool night air, gasping for breath as I found my friends waiting for me, eyes wide with concern. I recounted my harrowing experience, and as they glanced back toward the haunted house, they too heard the distant, maniacal laughter. No one dared to look back, and we ran to our cars, vowing never to speak of that night again. I still have nightmares about the masked clown, reminding me that sometimes, fear can come from the most unexpected places."

        "selftext": " \n\nMr. Faskell has cut my hair since I moved to the city about three years ago.\n\nHe’s an older guy, maybe fifties or sixties, and he possesses that look and drawl that makes me think he's from up North somewhere. He could be from New York, Maine, or even the Great Lakes area, but I never asked him where. He’s not a big guy, maybe a buck twenty in the rain, and he cuts my hair just the way I like it. High and tight on the sides, leave some on top so whoever I’m sleeping with has something to play with, and neaten up my sideburns. I can’t grow a real beard or he’d probably trim that for me too.\n\nThe best part is that he does it all for free!\n\nHard to believe, I know, but it seems there was a cost after all.\n\nOur relationship started easily enough. I had an interview with the city, Maintenance and Custodial, and I wanted to look sharp and make a good impression. Everything other than that paid nothing or barely nothing, and I really wanted to lock this job down. I had a nice set of interview clothes, some comfortable business shoes, and a winning smile, and I needed a sharp haircut to seal the deal.\n\nThat is where the problem lies.\n\nMy hair grows abnormally fast. It always has, and when I was a kid my Dad used to bemoan the fact. He made jokes about going to barber school or buying stock in Master Cuts, but he always understood that when it was time for a cut, it was TIME for a CUT. If you let it go longer than two weeks without a cut, it just turns into a shapeless mass. By the end of week three, I looked like a sheepdog and Dad would look over his paper and sigh before saying he would take me to the barber.\n\nFaskel’s Hair and Beards was about a block from my house, and when I stuck my head in to see their prices, Mr. Faskell looked up and smiled at me over the pile of hair he was sweeping up.\n\nThen, suddenly, he took a deep breath and when he opened his eyes again I asked if everything was okay.\n\n“Just fine, young man. Say, you look like a man in need of a haircut, am I right?”\n\nI told him he sure was and he invited me in and told me to have a seat.\n\nHe had about a million questions on that first visit. No, I didn’t usually let it get this long. I liked it this way but a little long on top. No, I didn’t use any special shampoo, just dandruff shampoo from the Dollar General. No, I wasn’t really prone to dry scalp, but a fella can never be too careful. On and on and on and on until, finally, it was done. He had cut it just right, the perfect length, the perfect fade, everything. I asked him what I owed him, and he told me it was free.\n\n“Come on,” I’d said, “You gotta charge me something.”\n\n“I let my customers pay what they can afford,” he said, “So whatever you can afford is fine with me. Think of it as a tip.”\n\nI was okay with that and walked out with a free haircut while Mr. Faskell waved me out with a ten-dollar tip. \n\nI left with a spring in my step. I felt like a new man, and I was ready for that job interview. I went home, got a shower, and when I looked in the mirror, I knew I had this. \n\nThe next time I went to see Mr. Faskell, I left him a twenty-dollar tip and told him it was all thanks to him that I had gotten my awesome new job.\n\nFor the next couple of years, I always went to Mr. Faskell when I needed a cut. If I had a date coming up, I went to Faskells. Promotion interview at work? Faskells. I told friends about his shop. I went there just to get a touch-up and talk with the old fella. In no time at all, Mr, Faskell and I were friends. He liked the same sports team I did, watched a lot of the same movies and TV shows I did, and even liked a lot of the same classic rock that I did.\n\nIt was great, and I always looked forward to my bimonthly haircut.\n\nThen, about two months ago, it all changed.\n\nI had come in to get my bimonthly cut, telling Mr. Faskell about the previous week as he cut and styled my hair. He was always meticulous, getting everything just right as he cut and trimmed, and when he turned me around to look into the mirror, it was the same way I had gotten it for the last three years. I thanked him, handed him ten bucks, and told him I’d see him soon. \n\n“Of course,” Mr. Faskell said, sweeping up the hair, “Come back anytime.”\n\nI was leaving, almost a block up the street, when I realized I didn’t have my sunglasses. They were my brand new Oakleys and they had cost quite a bit of cash. I remembered having them when I came up, taking them off my head, and setting them down at the station Mr. Faskell used. No problem, I thought, I’ll just go back and get them. \n\nI stepped in, saying I had forgotten my sunglasses and was just gonna grab them, and that's when I saw him.\n\nMr. Faskell was looking up guiltily, his eyes panicked.\n\nHe was down on all fours, eating the hair he had swept up off the ground like he was a cow in the field. When he turned, I could see pieces of hair sticking to his lip like accusations. He stood up, whipping himself off, brushing at his mouth as he tried to explain.\n\n“I know how this looks, and I’ll admit that yes, I was eating your hair. But, you have to understand, your hair is what I look forward to. I don’t eat just anyone's hair, well, I used to. Now I can’t wait to see you come in so I can eat something good. Why are you looking at me like that? I’m not crazy. I’M NOT CRAZY!” he shouted, getting up as he stalked toward me.\n\nHe seemed to realize that saying that made him sound crazy, so he switched gears.\n\n“Haven’t I always done good work for you? There's nowhere in this town that you would get a haircut for less than twenty-five dollars. I cut your hair for tips. I’ve cut your hair for the dollars in your pocket. I’ve been good to you, and you’ve been a good customer. Let's just pretend this never happened, okay? Let’s just go back to,” but I didn’t hear the rest.\n\nI snatched up my sunglasses and was out the door before he could say another word.\n\nI spent a while thinking about that, and the more I processed it, the worse it seemed to get. It began to haunt my dreams, seeing him bent over and eating the hair straight off the floor, looking back at me and grinning with my hair in his teeth, and I would wake up in a cold sweat. I know, it's not a particularly scary thing, but it freaked the hell out of me. I don’t really like it when people put hair in their mouths. I had a girl in elementary school who used to chew her pigtails and it bred a lifetime phobia in me. Just the thought of wet hair in someone's mouth makes me want to puke, and I can’t even touch someone's hair without cringing if they have a wig.    \n\nA weird collection of phobias, but they’re mine.\n\nIt only took a couple of weeks before I started seeing new growth. My hair just grows too fast, and after three weeks my boss commented that I was looking shabby. He handed me a twenty out of his own wallet and told me to get a trim over lunch. I took it and started looking for somewhere to get a trim. The city had quite a few shops, but it seemed like whenever I was in one, I caught someone looking at me out of the corner of my eye. It was never anything I could prove, just a feeling, and when I looked up, I could almost catch a glimpse of Mr. Faskell. He was gone when I looked, but it made me extremely paranoid.\n\nI became aware of more than a glimpse as the weeks went on. When I rode the bus to work, I caught the familiar deep inhale of someone smelling my hair. When I was standing in a lunch line, I felt my hair move as someone inhaled. When I was at Walmart buying groceries, someone actually touched my hair, but they were gone when I turned around. It led me to become something of a recluse, and I only left the house to go to work.\n\nOver time, my hair grew out and I decided I would have to get another cut.\n\nI went to bed, setting my alarm so I could get up early enough to get to the Master Cuts down on Bonnie. It was Saturday, I had the day off, and I had chores to do before I got to the business of relaxing. As I slipped off to sleep, I fell into a familiar dream, a dream that had plagued me for weeks. I was sitting in the barber chair at Mr. Faskell’s, the cape falling around me like a spider web, and the old man asking me if it was too tight. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared to speak, and as the scissors began to clip, I trembled in fear. I didn’t dare look back at the old man. I just knew his real face would be replaced by a monstrous visage and I would wake up panting and looking around for nothing at all.\n\nWhen the alarm went off, I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face and start the shower.\n\nMy bare shoulder itched, and when I went to wipe it off, I noticed there was hair clinging to my sweaty hand.\n\nNot a lot, just leavings.\n\nLike the leavings you find after a haircut.\n\nI ran to the bathroom and found that my hair was cut just the way I liked it. The sides were high and tight, the top was manageable but still thick, and my bangs were perfect. Everything was just as it usually was, and I felt a cold chill run through me that had nothing to do with air conditioning.\n\nI called the landlord, had the locks changed, and reported to the police that someone had broken into my house and cut my hair.\n\nThe police didn’t really take it seriously. They made jokes about a “Midnight Barber” and asked if I’d left a tip under my pillow. I told them about Mr. Faskell, but when I gave them the address, they just shook their heads and walked away. They thought I was joking with them, they didn’t believe a word of what I’d told them, and as I ran the shower, I remember sitting under the water for a very long time and just letting it run over me.\n\nThe bits of hair flowing down the drain felt like a betrayal.\n\nTwo weeks later, I woke up with another fresh haircut.\n\nI called the police but they rolled their eyes and told me to calm down. I told them it was hard for me to calm down when someone was breaking into my house and cutting my hair. I demanded they go check on Mr. Faskell, and told them right where his shop was, but they looked less amused this time at the suggestion. I asked if they had been to talk to him yet, and told them he had been there for three years, but they just told me it hadn’t been funny the first time and it wasn’t funny now.\n\n“Why would it be funny?” I asked, having to stop myself from grabbing one of them.\n\n“Because Faskells has never been open. It was a prop for the city's revitalization project, like Coolie Flowers across the street from it or Green Butcher beside it. It’s set dressing, it’s never open. Mr. Faskell was a guy who owned a barber shop in the twenties. He’s dead, there is no Faskell who cuts hair.”\n\nThey left, and that left me very rattled.\n\nMr. Faskell isn’t a ghost, I know that. I have friends who go to him. I have felt him touch me. He’s flesh and blood, just like I am, I’m sure of it! The fact that he eats hair is incidental. The man is real. But if he isn’t Mr. Faskell, then who is he? How does he keep breaking into my house? I have a window in my room, but it's barred with a piece of broom handle and I live on the third floor!\n\nI changed the locks again, I wedged a chair under my door, and when I finally made myself calm down enough to sleep, I hoped it would end.\n\nI woke up completely bald.\n\nNot buzzed, not at a zero guard, but bald. Like, someone shaved my head in my sleep and took the hair. They got my eyebrows too, my five o’clock shadow, and my thick sideburns. I was as smooth and hairless as a newborn baby. I don’t know what to do. I can’t call the cops, they won’t believe me. I can’t call the landlord, he’s replaced the locks twice now and is getting angry about it. I can’t afford to move, I can’t leave my job, I’m stuck.\n\nWhat I did find, however, was a message left on my nightstand. I’m sure the cops will say that I wrote it, but I know I didn’t. There’s hair on it and it's written in a heavy hand like a kid's scribblings. It’s done on the back of an ad for Faskell’s Hair and Beards, and the implication was pretty obvious.\n\n“Come see me when it grows back. If you don’t, it makes no difference. I know where to find you.”  "

        "selftext": "I can't explain it, but the butterflies seem to know where the bodies are.\n\n\nI've been a park ranger since I was eighteen, and after five years, I really can't imagine doing anything else. I was in the scouts when I was younger, and I've been an avid hiker all my life. Time spent in the woods is time well spent, and the ability to work there every day is honestly a dream come true. \n\n\nBeing a park ranger, you see your fair share of bodies in the woods. People come out here to hike and swim and forget that there are things here that will kill you. They run afoul of animals, they get sucked under in the rapids, they don't pack enough food or water, or they just get lost and aren't found till someone chances upon them.\n\n\nSpring two thousand twenty-three was the year that we got some help from the butterflies. \n\n\nIt started with the death of Angel Myers, but it certainly didn't end there.\n\n\nAngel Myers was what you would call a minimalistic camper. She would come in with a few essentials and a blanket, just kind of camp wherever she decided to drop down. She knew which plants would kill her and which ones would nourish her, which was good. She also knew which plants would get her higher than airplane wings, which was bad. We had called the police on Angel several times, but they always cut her loose after a few months, and the rangers refused to toss her a lifetime ban from the park so she just kept coming back.\n\n\nWhen a pair of hikers told us they had found a body in an area we knew as The Meadow, we supposed this would be the last time we called the police for her.\n\n\nShe was naked, and it wasn't the first time any of us had seen her in this state. She wasn't bad to look at, but it was always a little weird to find someone stark naked in the elements. She was splayed out, spread eagle, in the flowers that grew in the meadows, and her eyes and tongue were missing. That wasn't terribly uncommon either, not with all the varments in the park, but the little black growths on her skin were definitely something I had never seen before. She had three rows of perfect little spikes, each of them about three inches long and each line about nine spikes long.\n\n\nOther than the spikes, the strangest part of the whole scene were the butterflies.\n\n\nThey were not a species I was familiar with, and they were bone white with light black patterns on the wings. They were thick over the body, and I assumed they had been what had drawn the hikers. They were circling in a thick cloud, the whites easily seen against the green canopy around them, and I was as amazed by them as I was the weird protrusions on her skin.\n\n\n\"What the hell are these?\" I asked, reaching out a finger to test if they were sharp, but finding them squishy and full of green liquid.\n\n\n\"Pallida mors,\" said Rico, one of the rangers who worked with me.\n\n\n\"One more time in English, for the rest of us,\" I said.\n\n\n\"Pale Death,\" he said, pointing to the butterflies, \"They're rare, I don't think I've seen one in the flesh. They're supposed to live in the deep woods, and they only come out once every few years to lay eggs.\"\n\n\nI pointed to the little row of black spikes running up her thigh, \"On corpses?\"\n\n\nRico nodded, \"That's why they call them Palida Mors. They lay their eggs on corpses, though it's usually of animals. I have heard of them laying eggs on human bodies, but it's rare. I guess they found the corpse before we did.\"\n\n\nThe hikers said the same when we questioned them. They had been hiking to the meadow, his fiance wanting to see it in spring, and as they came to the end of the trail, she had noticed the swarm of pale butterflies and wanted a closer look. She had thought they were so pretty, but as they came closer, they had seen the body and realized what they were swarming around it.\n\n\nWe called the station and got some guys from the coroner's office down to pick her up.\n\n\nWe hoped she would somehow be the last body we found that spring, but I think, even then, I knew this wouldn't be the last body I saw taken from the park that year.\n\n\nThe next one was a hiker named Marcus Dray, and his death was truly terrible. \n\n\nSome campers had gone fishing in the Conusquat River, the waterway that runs through the park, and as they chased the trout who were beginning their journey to the spawning grounds, one of their kids came across a grizzly sight. He said it looked like a scaled claw was sticking out of the river, and he ran to get his mother, thinking it was a monster. She had expected a rock formation or maybe a stick with some moss on it, but what they found was an arm covered in the black spike pods the butterflies left behind. \n\n\n\"They looked like scales,\" the mother had said, still a little shaken by the experience, \"and I could understand why he thought it was a monster hand. It wasn't until I got closer that I realized it was an arm jutting up from the foam.\"\n\n\nAt first, we thought the guy had just fallen into the river and gotten stuck between the rocks after drowning. When we pulled him out, however, we got a better idea of the extent of the damage. Something forced him into the small space between the two rocks, and they hadn't done it gently. His shoulders were broken, like snapped in the middle and just folded up. He was crumpled up like a suit coat in the hole, and that wasn't all.\n\n\nSomething had eaten his face.\n\n\nNot like Angel, where her eyes and tongue were missing. They had eaten his entire face off, down to the skull, and there was nothing left but ragged flesh and scored white bone. If it hadn't been for the arm sticking up, we might have never found him until someone panning for minerals found a finger or a skull. \n\n\nThe butterflies, the Pale Death, presided over the whole thing as we managed to get him onto the shore.\n\n\nAfter that, we found four more bodies in a month. \n\n\nOne was left on a mountainside, its hands missing and its nose and lips chewed off. He had been climbing the low-grade mountain we have on the grounds, and when he'd gone missing we thought it might be a small avalanche due to snow melt. When a fisherman found him laid out on the lowest peak of the mountain, however, we knew it was something much worse.\n\n\nThe second was a woman who'd gone into the woods to relieve herself during a picnic and was found in the low branches of a tree, well, half of her was. The other half was high up in the tree, and something had eaten her legs. The husband had to be hospitalized after he identified the top half of his wife, and I felt bad for her kids. They had been here to enjoy a picnic in the park, and something had taken that away from them. \n\n\nThe third was, unfortunately, a child named Kaitlyn Mills. Kaitlyn would have been six in July, but she never got the opportunity. Kaitlyn was the strangest and also the easiest to identify. Kaitlyn had left her parents campsite in the night, but it appeared that whatever had found her had taken an interest in her. Something had taken care of her in the woods. Something had fed her, something had changed her clothes, something had made sure she drank clean water, and then, unfortunately, its care had lapsed. Kaitlyn hadn't died because her face had been eaten off, she had died because her skull had connected with the ground and cracked. It was pretty clear she had fallen out of a tree, but the coroner said she would have needed to fall from a pretty steep height. She was stretched out too, as if something had made her comfortable as she lay dying.\n\n\nThe fourth was the worst, and the reason for what came after.\n\n\nThe fourth was Ranger Franklin Carpenter, and he had gone missing after going to check one of the pump stations. We had six pump stations, things we used to bring clean water to the campgrounds, and he had been responding to a call about a malfunction in station four. He had gone out before lunch, and we found what was left of him the next day after he never came back. If he hadn't died wearing his name tag then we wouldn't have known who it was. His arms and legs were missing and believed to have been eaten. His face was gone, as was the top of his skull and what lay within. Something had gnawed his chest, eaten his buttocks, and chewed his genitals off for good measure. He was just a torso and part of a head when we found him on the edge of the woods, and a lot of us got pretty scared after losing one of our own like that.\n\n\nOver all four bodies, the butterflies held sway, and their eggs were in evidence. \n\n\nI expected a visit from the Head Ranger, but when he arrived with a man in a dark suit the next day, we should have known something was about to happen. He had a few other men in similar attire, and Rico lifted an eyebrow as we took our seats at briefing. None of these guys were dressed for more than a slow stroll over concrete paths, but I doubted that was their intention.\n\n\n\"Agent Lee has been gracious enough to come and help us with our little problem. We will be splitting all of you into groups so you can canvas the woods. We need to find whatever is doing this before summer starts, especially with one of our own being a recent casualty. We have a lot of ground to cover, so, Rangers will be splitting off with two of Agent Lee's boys to show them the trails and help them bring this to a close.\"\n\n\nSo, that's how I found myself in the woods with Agents Fiest and Agent Martin. Agent Lee might have looked like an investment banker, but these two had traded their Brooks Brothers suits for camo and assault rifles. We had broken out the shotguns that we used for putting off angry wildlife to supplement the firepower the Agents had brought, and the three of us proceeded through the woods. Agent Fiest wasn't a big talker, but Agent Martin made up for it by asking questions about what we had seen. I told him about the bodies, the parts that had been eaten, and the butterflies that seemed to hover around everything.\n\n\n\"Butterflies?\" Fiest said, and it was probably the only thing I had heard him say in the hour we had been walking.\n\n\n\"Yeah, Rico calls them something in Latin that basically means Pale Death. They show up around the bodies and just kind of mark where they are.\"\n\n\nFiest gave Martin a look and the two nodded knowingly.\n\n\n\"Have you seen anything near the sights? Footprints or scales maybe? Stuff like insect skin?\"\n\n\nI shook my head, \"No, mostly just dead people.\"\n\n\nI was preparing to ask them what they thought we were looking for since they clearly knew something, when we came through a dense stand of trees and into an open space that was anything but open. It seemed invested with the pale butterflies, and as we stalked in, they fluttered around us almost gladly. The two Agents took this as a good sign but I wasn't sure what to think. These things had been a pretty foul omen in the last few months, and finding a huge number of them now seemed less than ideal. \n\n\nAs we moved into the cloud of butterflies, it also seemed like something was stalking us. Through the thick wave of insects, there was a large shadow that stalked us. It almost appeared human-sized, but the longer I watched it flit through the swarm, it seemed to grow. It may have had as few as two arms, or as many as eight, but the wings I saw stir its smaller kin were what worried me.\n\n\nThey were tall and white, just like the others, and it seemed to be using them as a blind as it lured us deeper.\n\n\n\"It's close,\" Martin whispered.\n\n\n\"Steady,\" Fiest said. \"If we spook him, he might fly away before we can take him out.\"\n\n\n\"What?\" I half whispered, talking too loud, but too scared to care.\n\n\nFiest looked at Martin, shrugging at something in the other's face.\n\n\n\"You've heard of the moth man? Well, there are counterparts to that thing. The people of Joplin talk about how many of their children were saved from a tornado by these \"butterfly people,\" but they assume those who were lost were taken by said tornado, and not the same creatures who saved them. We call them Lycaenidae Bipedus, and they are extremely,\" but he never got to finish.\n\n\nSuddenly the cloud of butterflies enveloped us, their small bodies clinging to us as they struck. Our vision was cut off, and as the automatic weapon chattered, I hit my belly and started crawling. I wanted to get out of the swarm, to get away from the wild bark of the gun, and as I crawled, I heard people yelling. The wet sound of something being torn cut off some of the screaming, but the gunfire persisted as I kept making my way out of the cloud of insects. \n\n\nI kept crawling until I made it out of the clearing, and once I was no longer being buffeted by butterflies, I got up and started running.\n\n\nI could still hear the gunfire behind me, but I knew that what I wanted was to live. \n\n\nI knew that if I stayed, I'd be dead, and I still very much wanted to live. \n\n\nI ran until someone yelled at me to stop and shoved a gun in my face. \n\n\nIt was another one of the Agents, and as they all coalesced, I was ordered to take them back to the spot where I had left Agent Fiest. \n\n\nAs little as I wanted to go back, I agreed.\n\n\nBy the time I found it again, Fiest was sitting on something he had covered with a tarp. Fiest's left arm was hanging uselessly at his side, his clothes were ripped to shreds, but he was grinning like a big game hunter who's bagged the big one.\n\n\n\"Get it to the truck. Tell the boys back at base I had no choice but to kill it. It refused to come peacefully and forced my hand.\"\n\n\nMartin was dead, his body covered in a slew of crushed butterflies. I saw him before they could tarp him as well. Something had torn his thrown out, and I assumed it was whatever was under the big tarp that Fiest was guarding. They took both the tarped bodies away, and when Fiest came towards me, I was worried he would be angry that I had fled.\n\n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder instead and nodded in understanding.\n\n\n\"Don't feel bad, kid. I would have run too if I'd had the choice. Both Agent Martin and I knew what we were getting into. You got us here, that's what counts.\"\n\n\nThey took it away, and the murders stopped.\n\n\nWe lost two more hikers that year, but they were both killed by the elements.\n\n\nThe butterflies left that same day, never (hopefully) to return.\n\n\nI can’t help but think about that spring again as winter abates and the season gets warmer.\n\n\nI tell you one thing, I’ll be keeping an eye peeled for butterflies from now on."

        "selftext": "This happened on Christmas eve 2021. I'm male and was 15 at the time. my parents and younger siblings had gone for a drive to look at all the Christmas lights in the next town, Like we did every year.\n\nThis year however I decided to stay home. Which meant I was home alone. I didn't mind though as I had planned to watch a movie and eat some junk food. I locked the doors, turned on the t-v, and settled on the couch.\n\nI was halfway through the movie, when I heard a loud thud from the window. I paused the movie and listened. It sounded like someone intentionally did it.\n\nI thought maybe it was one of my friends messing with me but I live on 100 acres of mostly woods, and its to far away for them to walk here from town and it’s poring down with snow. so I wasn't expecting anyone to be out there. I decided to check it out, just in case.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight, and headed to the window. I shone the flashlight around, looking to see if anyone was out there. I scanned the area, but saw nothing and figured I was just hearing things, so I went back to watching the movie. But then, I heard another thud, this time from the back door.\n\nI jumped up and ran to the door and right before I reached it I saw a note slide in from underneath. I quickly looked through the little glass window but couldn't see anyone. I then picked up the note and written on it was: \"Merry Christmas\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. Who was out there? And why were they doing this? I backed away from the door and tried calling my parents but thanks to the snow i didn't have any reception. \n\nI double-checked to make sure all the windows and doors were locked, each time I checked a window I felt like someone was right on the other side WATCHING me.\n\nI was standing in the living room thinking about what I should do. When all of a sudden both the t-v and the lights went out. the power had been cut. Now I'm starting to get worried, I don't know who's out there or what their intentions are. \n\nI headed to the front door, flashlight in hand. That's when I saw it - There was another note sitting under the door. I was hesitant to pick it up but I slowly made my way to it and grabbed it, this time it said: \"I'mma get you.\" And right as I read it, whoever was out there started banging on the door and LAUGHING - i could hear him FUCKING LAUGHING. all I could think in that moment was \"it's Christmas Eve and I'm about to die.\" I dropped the note and RAN to my parent's room.\n\nI remembered my dad kept a spare key to his old Camaro in the closet. I thought if I got the key I could climb through a window and sneak out to the car. By this point it sounds like he's about to break the door down and I hear him yelling:\n\n\"imma get you kid! Imma get you!\"\n\nOkay I'm not staying here to wait for him to break in. I found the key to my dad's car and as soon as I opened the window the banging stopped, I waited a while before jumping out. thinking that he's probably going around the back to find a way in. I quietly climbed through the window and snuck around to my dad's Camaro, I didn't see the man anywhere so I figured he either broke into the house or he went around the back.\n\nI opened the door and got in being careful not to close it all the way to be quiet. my heart dropped when I saw a folded piece of paper on the steering wheel. was this one of his notes? It can't be. How would he know I was going to get in the car? I didn't want to open it - but I had to. I couldn't just leave without checking it. I unfolded the paper and read what it said.\n\nI IMMEDIATELY jumped out of the CAR - the note said: \"look behind you.\" My heart was beating out of my chest. I mustered up the courage to shine my flash-light through the window, and saw his silhouette in the back SEAT - he was actually in THERE.\n\nhe somehow knew I was going to try and leave in the Camaro and he was waiting for me. I ran back to the house and found the front door wide open (he must have gotten it open with all the banging earlier.) I went inside and watched the Camaro from the window.\n\nIt was around 9 p-m by now and I knew my parents would be back soon. I didn't take my eyes off of that car for atleast 15 minutes before I see my parents coming up the driveway.\n\nI ran out screaming like a crazy person. My dad jumped out of the car asking what's wrong, all I could say was: \"he's in the Camaro!\" My dad says: \"who is. Who's in my car?\" I explained everything the best I could and my dad went over to confront the man.\n\nOnly there is no man - it's a jacket with the hood-up on a piece of wood from our wood pile. And another a note saying \"I'm watching\"\n\n\nMy dad thought I was playing a joke on him until he saw that the front door had been kicked in. He told us to wait in the car, and to call the police while he checked the house.\n\nMy dad came out 10 minutes later and said the back door was open and there were fresh foot prints in the snow, leading to the woods behind the house. Police arrived not long after and searched the house and woods.\n\nThe man was never found but what they did find still freaks me out to this day. On the dining room table they found one of our large kitchen knife's, my cell phone, and another hand written note. The note read: \"got you. P-S see you soon.\" That's not even the worst part. \n\nWhen I opened my phone I saw that the camera had been used. there was pictures of me looking out the window when I thought the man was in the Camaro. but in reality - he was actually standing only a few feet behind me, the entire TIME.\n\nThere were also pictures of my dad when he checked the Camaro. \n\nWhich meant this psycho was still in the house watching us, only moments before my dad checked to see if he was there. I don't know what his intentions were, whether he thought this was some kind of joke or something.\n\nBut this guy was obviously unhinged. Unfortunately, this story doesn't end here.\n\nTwo years later. We're still in the same house, and we haven't had any sign of the man, or any trouble since - until today. It's almost Christmas 2023, and I discovered another one of his notes. It said;\n\n\"I'm back. Merry fucking Christmas.\""

        "selftext": "She left no Footprints in the Snow\n\n\n\"Come on, just one more drink? You know I'm good for it.\"\n\n\nThe bartender looked at me evenly, his dark eyes slitted as he tried to hide his frustration, \"I know no such thing. You've still got money on your books from the week before last, and you dare to come in here flaunting your wealth? I was a fool to let you drink before you had settled your tab. Now get out.\"\n\n\nThe other drunks at the bar laughed, egging the bartender on as he crossed his arms. \n\n\nI wanted to argue, but the man was quite a bit larger than me, and I realized the futility of continuing. \n\n\nHe would win, just as everyone did when they went up against me, so I hung my head and mumbled something about leaving.\n\n\nAs I stepped into the cold winter air, I felt some of my buzz deteriorate, the derision of my drinking companions following me out into the chill weather.\n\n\nI was too drunk to be walking home, but it was my only means of convenience. \n\n\nI lived in Osaka at the time, back in the early two thousands. I was not what you would call a solid citizen. I believe the word most of my culture uses for people like me is NEET. It basically means I wasn't enrolled in school, I wasn't working on a family, and I wasn't in a job. I had never been a very diligent worker or a very good student. The jobs I'd had were menial and often didn't last longer than a month or two. My grades had been good enough to get me into several very expensive cram schools, but not into college. With no real prospects, I had settled into my life as a nobody. My parents paid for a cheap one-bedroom apartment in a part of town where you had to step over the winos as you stumbled home. They sent me money to avoid having me come to the house and bring shame on them. I didn't care, all my money went to booze or even less lofty pursuits, and I was essentially circling the drain.\n\n\nI suppose fate had another plan because that was when I met a very special woman on my way home.\n\n\nI had been celebrating a small victory that night, but it seemed that my luck had run out. I had a little extra money after my raffle ticket had brought a small windfall, and I had been buying drinks for a few of the barflies in an effort to get some female companionship that evening. They had taken my drinks and laughed at my jokes, but when the money was gone, so were they. I had drunk up all my extra money, and after having no luck mooching drinks from the usual bar patrons, I was forced to head home.\n\n\nIt was early December, and the snow on the ground was only an inch or two. The black ice glistened treacherously from the damp pavement, and I was trying my best not to weave too much as the bracing air took some of my buzz with it. The streets were mostly deserted, a few late-night pedestrians here and there, and the lights were far from seasonal. We don't really celebrate Christmas in Japan, not like Americans do, and the lights here were usually from the billboards or the advertisements that lit the night as well as the street lamps. \n\n\nI had turned a corner, heading from the trendy part of town I had been drinking in and into the less savory area where I lived, when I first saw her. I stopped for a moment, not quite believing what I was seeing. It was a youngish woman, her long black hair blowing in the winter wind and her bare feet walking delicately atop the snow. She was dressed in some kind of robe, a wrapper too light for the weather, and I followed behind her as I tried to find the courage to speak to her.\n\n\nIf she was out here in so little on a night like this, then she had to be as drunk as I was. Either that or on some kind of drug, but neither of that mattered much to me. There was heat in my apartment and a little more beer in the fridge. We could get warm together, maybe have a little drink, and watch the sun come up over the edge of my balcony. In her current state, I had little doubt that she would be glad for a warm place to stay, and as I quickened my pace to come even with her, I tried to find my best opening gambit.\n\n\n\"Good evening, what's a beautiful flower like you doing in the snow?\"\n\n\nNow that we were even with each other, I could see her better. Her skin was as perfect as a china doll, her complexion smooth as porcelain and her color as pale as milk. Her eyes were small and dark, focused ahead as she made her way towards wherever she was going, and it almost seemed she was ignoring me. That was nothing new, women often pretended they couldn't see me, but it was the little glances that kept me invested. \n\n\nShe kept glancing at me with these coquettish glances, favoring me with these intriguing lifts of her thin lips, and they kept me interested.\n\n\n\"Aren't you cold? I know somewhere you can come to warm up. Your feet must be freezing.\"\n\n\nWe were about five or six blocks from my apartment, and since she seemed to be heading in that direction anyway, I thought my luck might be turning around.    \n\n\nThe two of us kept walking, me chatting away as she glided across the icy sidewalk. She seemed immune to the black ice that sometimes tripped me up, and I began to notice how smoothly she moved. I know that sounds a little strange, but she moved as if her feet never touched the ground. It was like watching someone operate an extremely lifelike puppet, but it only seemed odd through the lens of my memories.\n\n\nAt the time, I was just a drunk and slightly amorous male who was hoping to trick this clearly intoxicated woman back to my apartment.\n\n\nI'm not the hero of this story, that should be obvious.\n\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked, realizing I didn't even know what her name was, but all I got in return was that same sly side-eye. Her face was utterly emotionless until she glanced at me and smirked. She seemed to know how to keep my interest, and I had become less flustered by the wind the longer we walked. I felt myself slowing to match her pace, my wet socks and cold feet no longer bothering me, and as we turned onto a familiar street I realized we were about two blocks from my apartment. I could even see my window from here, the buttery yellow light spilling out onto the street through the dirty window of the sliding door, and I smiled as I thought about how the sun would look as it came in through that pallid portal. \n\n\nWhen she turned suddenly, I almost missed it.\n\n\nWe were nearly there, the front gate to my apartment complex less than twenty steps up the road, and she had suddenly glided into the space between two buildings. The alley was a known haunt for winos and bums, and I found myself standing at the entrance as I watched her stroll into the semi-darkness. She had captured me effortlessly, and when she spun preternaturally in the low light and crooked a finger at me, I was taking that first step before I could stop myself. \n\n\nLuckily for me, the black ice got me before she did.\n\n\nI slipped, falling onto my butt, and as the cold rushed over me, I sobered a bit.\n\n\nThat was how I noticed that, despite the snow in the alley being deep enough to cover the first three inches of the garbage cans and dumpster, she hadn't left a single footprint in the snow. \n\n\nI looked back and saw that the only footprints back the way we had come were mine, and that was when something hung in my booze-soaked broan.\n\n\n\"Beware of the Yuki Onna, my son,\" my mother had told me when I was very young, \"Be careful that she doesn't get you while you're out in the snow.\"\n\n\nI had stopped on my way out the door, my sled under my arm and my boots unmarked by moisture as of yet, and asked her what that was.\n\n\n\"Yuki Onna sometimes hunt for handsome men and try to take their life force. It stalks them through the snow, luring them away so it can get them alone, and freezes them in place as it draws out their precious life energy. So if a beautiful woman tries to take you away, come home quick and tell me so I can scare her off.\"\n\n\nShe had said it jokingly, but as I sat in the snow, I realized I was about to do exactly what she had warned me against.\n\n\nThe porcelain woman, a woman I now noticed left no trace behind, crooked a finger at me again, but I was up and running before it could waggle more than once.\n\n\nFortune was with me, and I didn't find another puddle of ice until I reached the stoop of my apartment. I could hear her behind me, her scream the roar of a winter wind, and as I rounded the gate and came into the courtyard, I expected to be pounced on at any minute. It would serve me right, I realized as I came shakily up the steps to the front door. I had thought I was the hunter, seeking my prey to lure it home, but I had been tricked and ran afoul of a much larger predator. I stumbled on the ice near the door, fumbling my key from my pocket, and as I looked up, I saw her reflected in the glass.\n\n\nHer hair was no longer straight, writhing behind her as it rose like a nest of vipers. The wrapper now looked more like a funeral shroud, the edges tattered and dark with grave soil. Her dark eyes were now large and round, their centers full of terrible knowledge, and her jaw was opening much too wide as I slammed the key in the lock and rushed inside.\n\n\nI shoved the door closed behind me, expecting a loud bang as she barreled through it, but when I turned to look from the stairs, the courtyard was empty save for the snowdrifts.\n\n\nI drank the beer in my fridge alone that night, realizing how close I had come to death, and deciding it was time to make some changes.\n\n\nI called my mother the next day and told her I needed help.\n\n\nThat was twenty years ago, and my nights of midnight carousing are behind me. I went to cram school, got my test scores up, started college, and now I work as an Engineer. My wife and I met in college, and we got married after she finished her doctorate. We have an apartment in a much better part of town, a son getting ready for highschool, and my current life is as far from that apartment where I saw the snow woman in as night from day. I no longer depend on my parents, and I've left the rut I had wallowed in for so long behind me.\n\n\nI still go out drinking with my coworkers sometimes, but now I'm careful how much I have before making my way home.\n\n\nOn the night I barely escaped death, two homeless men were found frozen to death in that very alley. The news believed they had succumbed to the elements, but I think the Yuki Onna was simply looking for a third course to its long meal. Some nights, when the snow falls and leaves drift on the sidewalks, I sit in my apartment, and just wonder if it's still out there, hunting the streets of Osaka for its next meal.\n\n\nThen I remember how lucky I am to have escaped the cold embrace of the Yuki Onna."

        "selftext": "\nI’ve been taking care of my grandma lately.\n\n\nShe’s been doing pretty bad and she needs someone there to help her almost twenty-four-seven. She’s got some kind of bone disease, it's basically turning her bones into Swiss cheese, and I’ve had to carry her to the bathroom and room to room for the past two weeks. This might seem kind of tiresome to some people, but I’m glad to do it. My Grandma and I have always been close, she basically raised me since my mother was never at home. If I can give back to her now, I consider it fair.\n\n\nShe’s been alone since I was in high school, and those ten years have been the happiest I’ve ever seen her.\n\n\nShe and Grandpa had been married for decades, fifty years before Grandpa left, but they never seemed to get along. When I was young, Grandma would always come over and stay the night instead of having me come over there. Grandpa never came to our house. He mostly stayed close to home or went to work, but the few times I interacted with him, he seemed way off. Even as a kid, I didn’t think he looked right. That might sound a little mean, but over time he got paler and less coherent. He would mumble to himself, this odd whispering thing he did while he was watching TV, and Grandma usually kept him in the bedroom with the lights off and the TV on. \n\n\nHe disappeared suddenly when I was in the ninth grade, and it had been almost as much of a relief to me as Grandma.\n\n\nSo last week when I slid her into bed and told her we were going grocery shopping the next day so she better get some sleep, she shook her head and looked away.\n\n\n“I doubt I will. I think this might be my last night in this bed.”\n\n\n“Why?” I asked, thinking she was joking, “You eyeing my bed? I’ll swap with you, but yours is much more comfortable than the one in the,”\n\n\n“No, son.” she cut me off, her voice thready and weak, “I think tonight's the night that I pass on.”   \n\n\nMy eyes got big, “Do I need to call Ms. Sam? If you think you're about to pass then I should get the nurses out here to,”\n\n\n“I don’t want them here. You’ve been good to me, kid. I just want you here with me at the end. Besides, I need to tell you something. I need to confess my sins before I take them to heaven with me.”\n\n\n“I mean, I can call Pastor Farris over here if you need to talk to someone about matters spiritual.” \n\n\n“No, not Bobby Farris either. I want to confess to you. It’s family business, and once I confess it to you, it’ll be your burden to carry after I’m gone.”\n\n\nI hesitated, thinking that I might not want this secret as I looked at my Grandmother’s face. I had seen that face smile more than anything else, but the look she had now reminded me of something else I had seen when I was young. It was something I hadn’t noticed until I looked back through the lens of time, but Grandma had always seemed a little nervous whenever she stayed at our house. I caught her more than once checking the doors and windows, looking through the living room curtains as if expecting to see someone there, and it always made me think she was scared of someone.\n\n\nIt was a look that always made me think a stranger was trying to get in so they could take me.\n\n\nThe truth, it seemed, was darker than that.\n\n\nI sat down on the bed, willing to listen as little as I wanted to, “I’m here, Grandma. If you need to tell me something, then I’ll listen.”\n\n\nGrandma nodded, looking out the dark window of her bedroom like someone might be there. \n\n\n“Your grandad didn’t disappear,” she said, wetting her lips with his wrinkled tongue, “I killed him.”\n\n\nThat was a shock, and my face must have said as much.\n\n\nShe smiled without much mirth, “Didn’t think your old Grandma was capable of something like that, huh?”\n\n\n“No, it’s just surprising. You guys lived together for decades, I’m not sure why you would choose ten years ago to,”\n\n\n“That wasn’t the first time,” she said, her voice as thin as a spiderweb, “I killed your Grandpa for the first time in nineteen seventy-three. Ten years ago was just the last time I had to kill him.”\n\n\nI was confused and I said as much, but Grandma only nodded.\n\n\n“Your Grandpa, your REAL Grandpa, died in nineteen seventy-two, but he didn’t stay dead.”\n\n\nShe laid it all out, something that took us nearly into the next day, but she never stopped looking out the window as she spoke.\n\n\nI realize now that she was looking for Grandpa.\n\n\n“When the call came, I was pregnant with your mother. Your Grandpa had avoided the draft by attending college and had managed to avoid it again with a waiver from the government. He was an engineer, working on bridges and sewer systems in DC, and I was looking forward to having him home in a few weeks. He had promised to come home before the baby was born, and he was excited to meet his daughter. We had wanted children for years, and when we talked you could hear the tears on the verge of coming out whenever we talked about our future.\n\n\nThe phone call that day, however, seemed to be the end of that dream. \n\n\nThey said he had been killed in a car accident and that it had been very quick. He had been driving to a job site when someone had run a red light and slammed into the driver-side door. They said he died instantly, hadn’t suffered a bit, and I suppose that should have been a mercy. They wanted to bury him in the capital, but I was adamant that he be buried here. I wanted his daughter to see him, to know her father, but I couldn’t have known how much she would know him.\n\n\nA week later, before his body was even home, I heard someone in the kitchen late at night.”\n\n\nGrandma’s voice got low, the husk making my skin crawl as she stared through the little window into the past.\n\n\n“I must have looked a sight as I came out with the baseball bat, but he never saw me coming. It was a man in military fatigues, eating a sandwich and sitting at my kitchen table like he owned the place. He hadn’t bothered to turn on any lights, and the closer I got, the more I saw. He had left a duffel bag on the floor beside him and there was a glass of milk sweating on the table beside his plate. His fingers slipped into the white bread, and the lettuce and tomato looked wet against the roast beef poking out. I didn’t challenge him, I don’t think he ever even knew I was there, and when I hit him in the side of the head he went down like a sack of potatoes.\n\n\nI killed him in one hit, hit him just right, but when I went to see who he was, I felt like I might have a heart attack.\nIt was your Grandad. \n\n\nHe was laid out on the floor, bleeding from the ears, his blood staining his fatigues. I looked up the pins he had been wearing years after the fact and realized he had been a corporal in the army. His paperwork said he was back on leave for the birth of his child, and he was on two weeks of leave before he had to return to Vietnam. I was confused, my husband had never been in the Army, and as I sat there trying to figure out what to do, I decided to just bury him in the backyard. My husband was dead and calling up the police to let them know that this man had broken in so he could eat a sandwich would only muddy the waters.\n\n\nSo I buried him in the backyard, no easy feat for a woman who's seven months pregnant.\n\n\nThree days later I was sitting in the living room, folding laundry and just trying to get back to normal when I heard keys in the front door.\n\n\nI heard someone come in, set their bag down on the end table, and then I heard the last voice I ever expected to hear.\n\n\n“Sorry, I’m late, dear. There was something in the office I had to set up for tomorrow before coming home.”\n\n\nIt was your Grandpa, dressed in a crisp white button-up and pressed suit pants. His tie was blue and white, something I had never seen before and looked expensive. I had never seen any of these clothes before, and I was the one who did all the laundry. He spread his arms wide, waiting for a hug, but I couldn’t move. I had killed him three nights ago, I watched him die, and as I backed away from him I saw his face twisting in confusion.\n\n\nIt was a painful look, a look that hurt my heart.\n\n\n“What's wrong? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. It’s me, it's Windel, your lovin man.”\n\n\nI was against the door frame, hyperventilating, clutching my stomach as your mother kicked inside me. She could sense my fear, feel my uncertainty, and she was responding in kind. He took a step towards me and I curled into a ball as I tried to protect myself from whatever he meant to do. I expected him to try to attack me, to turn into a vengeful spirit, and come after me, but instead, he just wrapped his arms around me and hugged me close.\n\n\n“What's wrong, Darlin? Are you okay? Talk to me.”\n\n\nIt sounded just like him and when I wrapped my arms around him I realized it felt just like him too. The smell of his aftershave, the rasp of his 5 o’clock shadow on my cheek, the way his hair smelled like Selsun blue, it was all things that let me know it was him. When he hugged me to him, I gasped as I felt the lump on his inner arm where a birth defect had left a bone poking slightly out. It was him, it was your Grandad, and I just leaned into him and sobbed as he helped me to my feet and took me to the bedroom.\n\n\nI checked the back of his head later that night as he slept, but there wasn’t a mark or anything to lead me to believe he had been the one I clobbered a few nights ago.\n\n\nI lived with this version of your Grandpa for six months. He worked as a manager at a paper company, his degree in business instead of engineering, and he made a comfortable living for us. If I needed a reminder of the old times, however, I only had to look at the graduation photo hanging in the hallway. It was me and your Grandpa, him in his cap and gown and me in my best dress, smiling as his mom snapped a photo. I caught him looking at the picture sometimes, trying to rationalize it, before finally moving away to do whatever he had been heading out to do. \n\n\nHe was there for the birth of your mother, and I settled into a life of maternal bliss. Your Grandfather was much the same as he had always been, trading talk of bridges for talk stocks and paper sales, but he was still the same man he had always been. He loved your mother and me dearly, we never wanted for anything, but after a while, I suspected that something was off about him. \n\n\nIt started with the sleep talking.\n\n\nHe would mumble ceaselessly from the time his eyes closed till the time he opened them. Your Grandfather had always been a prolific snorer, even since he was little as his mother liked to say, but now he never seemed to breathe at all when he slept. He would mumble on and on about sewers and the war and stocks and paper and raising dogs and breeding horses and a million other things. Between your mother's nightly feedings and your grandfather's ceaseless muttering, I was becoming ragged. I couldn’t sleep with all that yammering, and no matter where I slept, it always seemed to find me.\n\n\nI tolerated it until one night when I heard something familiar.\n\n\nI came awake to the sound of someone chewing and mumbling.\n\n\n“Where are they,” chew chew chew, “I can’t believe I had to make my own food. It’s not enough that I,” chew chew chew, “went and fought them for her, but now I have to make my own sandwich.”\n\n\nI had been sleeping on the couch, trying to get some sleep away from the muttering, and as I crept up the hall, listening to him mumble, and even the squeak of the door didn’t rouse him from his nightmare.\n\n\n“She couldn’t even bother to wait for me,” chew chew chew, “just because my bus was a little late. I’m a war hero, a soldier, and she can’t even,” chew chew, but he paused then before gasping harshly, “Ouch, my head. What the hell was that? It's Maggy. Oh my God, she’s killed me. She killed me. She bashed my head in with a bat. I’m dead on the floor. Dead right by my kitchen table, my bloods going everywhere, she killed me, she killed me, she,”\n\n\nThe pillow was over his face before I could stop myself. I was just so ragged, so mentally fried, that I knew he would tattle on me. He’d wake up and tell the police and they would find the body and he’d be here alone with your mother and who knew what would happen then? He wasn’t her father, couldn’t be her father, and he might hurt her or kill her or,”\n\n\nShe looked back at me and I could see her eyes swimming with tears.\n\n\n“He only struggled a little and then I had another body to bury.”\n\n\nShe was quiet for a moment, her eyes returning to the window before continuing again.\n\n\n“The next one was a car salesman, but he was less like your Grandfather than the one before. I read something about how if you photocopy a photocopy the quality will degrade until it's almost unrecognizable. That was how this was. The next one sounded less like your Grandfather, was paler than him, and seemed to get lost sometimes. I lived with this one for two years until he suddenly wandered into traffic outside our house. I told the police that this one was a cousin of my late husband and that was why he looked so similar. \n\n\nThe one after that bred horses and when one threw him, I buried him at the edge of the range where he worked and went home expecting another one.\n\n\nI was becoming pretty good at losing husbands by now, and when the next one showed up, I hit him with a frying pan and left him in the backyard with the others.\n\n\nBy the time your mother came home from school, there was a new one in the living room reading the paper.\n\n\nOver the years, I’ve experimented with how durable they are. I pushed one off the roof after asking him to help me fix something. He broke his neck and I added him to the growing mass grave out there. I poisoned one over the course of a year until he dropped dead one morning over his oatmeal. I pushed one off a mountain during a hike, only to return to the hotel and find a new one there waiting for us. The copies became paler and less coherent, their voices becoming softer and less substantial. It got to the point that he couldn’t hold a job, his mind was like that of a dementia patient, and I would look up sometimes to find him watching me through the window of wherever I was. Your mother had moved out of the house by now, a retirement check from somewhere showing up in the mailbox from a company that manufactured pipes. The money was good, the money kept us afloat, but I was tired of living with this pale ghost.\n\n\nThen, eight years ago, he walked out of the house one morning and never came back.\n\n\nIn many ways it was a blessing. I had become responsible for him, I had taken care of him and led him around like a child, and now I was responsible for just me. I kept cashing those checks until they stopped coming about a year ago, and I kept waiting for the day when he might come back. I almost dreaded it, because it would mean that he had died and a new pale copy would take his place yet again.”\n\n\nGrandma turned away from the window, locking eyes with me as the night slid by outside.\n\n\n“Now, it's your secret. It’s your secret and your burden. The bodies in the back are still there, I checked periodically, and though they decompose, the bones remain. I don’t know if this version of your Grandfather will ever come back, but you will have to watch for him now. I’ve left everything here to you, the house, the accounts, everything. It’s yours now, and I pray it brings you joy.”\n\n\nShe lay down then, and I could almost watch the life slip out of her. By midnight she was dead, and when I turned to get the phone, I saw what she had been waiting for at the window. Gramps was paler than I remembered him, but he looked exactly the same, otherwise. He waved at me as he stood there before backing away and leaving the way he had come. I went to the backyard and looked, but there was no one there and no clues that anyone had been there in the first place.\nWe buried Grandma in a plot next to Grandpa’s original plot, and she lay peacefully there beside her husband.\n\n\nThe caretaker tells me that someone comes to see her though, leaving a single wildflower behind before moving on.\n\n\nI don’t think he’ll be back again, but who’s to say what the future might bring.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I called the police and let them know about all the bodies in the backyard. The sheriff came and exhumed them, asking all kinds of questions that he didn’t seem to believe the answers to. He had them tested and, to his surprise, all of them came back as a match for my Grandfather. Dental records, DNA, hair samples, it all came back a match and they were all left scratching their heads. They couldn’t really charge my Grandmother with it, you can’t put a dead woman in prison, after all, and they were left with a mystery for the ages.\n\n\nEither way, it's nice to have the bodies gone, and it was good that Grandma got to die at peace. \n\n\nAs for Grandpa, I guess I’ll just have to wait for the day when a new one shows up.\n\n\nHopefully, I won’t have a body of my own to bury when he does."

        "selftext": " \n\nMy grandmother and I have been roommates for about a year now. \n\nThat probably sounds pretty weird for a twenty-three-year-old to say, but I have to say that it's been a great arrangement. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have lived in the apartment for about three years now, both of us deciding that campus housing wasn't for us, and Grandma has honestly been the best roommate I've ever had. She cooks and cleans, doing so despite Regina and I telling her that we don't expect her to, and our laundry always seems to find its way into the closet once the hamper is full. She was one of those hippies who missed the sixties and is incredibly chill. I don't know many other grandmothers who like to sit on the back porch at night and have a beer or smoke a bowl. She doesn't judge me for what most people over fifty would consider an \"unnatural relationship\" either, which means the world to Regina and I. She's told my girlfriend many times that she considers her a second granddaughter and people in the community tell me how cool it is to have someone like Grandma in my life.\n\nMost nights while we were sitting on the porch, having a beer or two and passing around some stuff that's not strictly legal here, Grandma would tell us how this reminded her of when she was young. \n\n\"My friends and I used to sit on the verandas and drink wine sometimes. The nights in Greece were warm, and we used to just sit out in our shifts and tease the boys when they came by. It was a marvelous time to grow up. The war was a distant memory, at least for those of us who were young, and life was full of possibilities.\"\n\nGrandma grew up in Greece, missing the end of the war by three years, and she would often talked lovingly about her time there. She was never very clear about where she grew up, but it must have been near the water because many of her stories involved her and her friends swimming or going to the beach with boys they fancied. She had met Grandpa at seventeen, him studying abroad and her waiting tables in a cafe. She said it had been love at first sight, and he'd asked her to marry him once his time in Greece was over.\n\n\"He brought me back to California with him, and to me, it was the grandest place in all the world.\"\n\nShe often told us stories from when she was young, and Regina and I usually found ourselves laughing at the antics of her younger self. She and her friends had sounded less like a group of young girls and more like a group of street toughs, and Grandma told us how they had done everything from teasing boys into fighting to stealing a scooter and fleeing from the police. If it hadn't been for Great Aunt Sofie and Uncle Marteen, Grandma might have been a full-fledged criminal instead of a sometimes rapscallion.\n\nThey had all been happy stories, at least until tonight.\n\nRegina had come home from work and I could tell that something was off. Regina is in nursing school and often has to work in the ER as part of her studies. They pay them for their time, of course, but it's expected that students will pursue jobs in the medical field so they can gain experience. Regina is usually full of stories about how she helped clear the airway of a baby or how she got a patient to tell her that the \"prescription drugs\" they had taken were more recreational than they'd let on. Grandma and I had already started our little revel without her, and she took the beer I handed her with a shaky hand.\n\nI watched her sip at it for a few seconds, hands jittering, before finally asking her what had happened?\n\n\"They brought in a lady today. She had been stabbed over a dozen times and they said she had no pulse. They wheeled her in on a gurney and asked if I could notify the morgue that they had a Jane Doe to go back.\"\n\nI nodded, \"Not your first dead body, babe.\"\n\nRegina shook her head, \"I turned to get the phone, the paramedics walked away for a moment as a call came over their radio, and when I turned back, the woman had sat up. I was a little scared, but I thought it was just gas in the corpse or something. I turned back to the phone, and then the gurney creaked and she climbed off. She went walking up the hall like a ghost in her sheet, and when I started screaming, the paramedics came back in a hurry.\"\n\nIt seemed funny to me, a lady in a sheet shuffling up the hallway towards freedom, but I guess it was a little different when you were living it.\n\n\"Turned out she had just had a very weak pulse, and when she'd come to, she'd attempted to run. Her heart stopped before she could get to the door and she died right there in the ambulance bay.\"\n\n\"How horrible,\" I said, the image less funny now.\n\n\"She must have been searching for her killer, just like poor old Victor,\" Grandma said, patting Regina on the arm.\n\n\"Who?\" I asked, not sure who this Victor was that Grandma was talking about. \n\n\"Victor Mustraff.\" she elaborated, \"He was a handsome young man in the village I grew up in. He was quite a bit older than me, around twenty-two when I was thirteen, but he was so handsome. It was a shame what happened to him, but it was even worse what happened afterward.\"\n\nI leaned forward on the cheap plastic chair I was sitting in and asked her if she would tell us?\n\nShe nodded, adding, \"It's a little scary, though. At least, it gave me a shiver when I was young.\"\n\nAs she spoke, her eyes seemed to cloud a little, her mind traveling back over the years and the miles.\n\n\"It all started after Victor's murder.\"\n\nThey didn't realize it was a murder right away.\n\nPoor Victor was a carpenter, he and his brother Issac. The two worked for their father, Marcus, but it was pretty clear who Marcus favored. Victor was set to take over his father's operation when his father grew too old to work, and Victor had let this, and his charm, go to his head. He was vain, we all knew it, but he was charming too and his vanity was really no big deal. He dated many girls in the village, and my friends and I were even taken with him.\n\nThen, one day, he went missing.\n\nWe all searched for him, the whole town coming together to look for a favored son. Issac came with us, saying that his brother had left the job site after saying he had to go do something. We searched the woods, the hills, and everywhere around the village, but we couldn't find his car or Victor. \n\nHe was simply gone.\n\nA week went by with no sign of him, but most of us just assumed he had taken after some woman from out of town. Victor was prone to that sort of behavior, but this was the longest he had ever been gone. Issac went right on working as if his older brother wasn't just gone. Marcus was inconsolable. We saw him many evenings sitting on his porch, sot drunk and weeping openly. Issac would often be there trying to console him, but Marcus wanted nothing from him. My friends and I changed sides of the street when we walked past Marcuse's house, not wanting to get drawn into their arguments. \n\nThen, one night, someone said they saw something strange.\n\nI heard it around the market first. \n\nIt was an older woman, someone's grandmother, who said they had been walking home when they had encountered someone.\n\nSomeone they thought was Victor. \n\n\"He was staggering on a badly twisted leg, kicking up dust from the cobbles with every shaky stager. His clothes, however, looked like the kind of garments a dandy might wear. His vest was filthy, and his pants left a trail of water when he walked. I called his name, thinking he might have been in an accident, and when he turned around I thought for certain I might faint. The hair was wet and lank, the curtain seeming to spin in slow motion, and then I could see the weeping crater that was his face. He had no eyes, no nose, no mouth, and the hole where they had been did little but gurgle and wheeze. I screamed, turning away in my fright to clutch the edge of the fountain, and when I looked back, it was gone.\"\n\nI scoffed at her story as the other old ladies clutched their rosaries and told her she was lucky to be alive. Old women often made up things like this, I thought in my youthful wisdom, and went back to my shopping. It had likely just been some beggar or a scarred-up vagrant. I told my friends about it that night as we sat smoking on my mother's veranda and we all laughed at how silly she had been.\n\nWhen Julie saw him that night on her way home, it changed our outlook a bit.\n\nJulie was supposed to spend the night, but she had run home after dark to get something. She was gone for a little while, longer than I would have thought, and when she came back, she was out of breath and sweating, close to hyperventilating. It took us quite a while to calm her down, but finally, she told us that she had seen the man from the old woman's story.\n\n\"It was just like she said.\" She gasped, her face fearful as she recalled it, \"I was going home to get my records. When I came to the plaza, near the fountain, I heard a weird dragging sound. He came out of an alley and I turned to see his smooshed face looking straight at me. I ran as fast I could, but it seemed that no matter where I went, he was limping close by. I finally hid in the market until he shambled away, but I was terrified that he would find me.\"\n\nWe consoled her, trying to keep her quiet so she didn't disturb my parents with such talk, and eventually she went to sleep as her fear began to ebb.\n\nThe strange shambling man was all anyone could talk about in the coming days.\n\nPeople saw him walking through the streets, shambling along as though looking for someone. He would always be gone whenever groups came to see him, but the longer it lasted, the more people started traveling in groups. There was a lot of speculation about who it was and what they were after, but some people thought it was Victor. Chief among them was Miss Trayda, a woman believed to be a Strega. She claimed that Victor was seeking his killer, and wanted to find his body so they could use cruentation to find them. She had conducted things like this before, offering to help the police if they would let her display the body, but she had often been turned down. Cruentation was something old that she believed in, and it seems to associate guilt with blood coming from a dead body when the murderer touches it. No one really believed in it anymore, it was an ancient practice, and besides, how would you collect everyone up to touch the body? Our town was home to hundreds, and collecting them all would be quite the effort. Most people rolled their eyes at Miss Trayda, but I think a lot of them secretly believed that the shambling specter was Victor.\n\nWhen it broke into Marcus's house and scared him half to death, many more people thought it might also be Victor.\n\nA few people whispered in the market the next day that the spirit had come after Marcus, and there were some rumbles about checking if he was the murderer. Miss Trayda had started offering money to anyone who could find Victor's body. Some young men had started roving the streets at night to see if they could follow the specter back to its place of rest, but it seemed to avoid them as easily as it avoided the constables that hunted for it. This went on for several weeks and it was a very exciting time. People sat and made up wild rumors about the stranger and what it wanted, and my friends and I were no exception.\n\nThen, one night, it all came to an end.\n\nI remember being woken up by someone screaming. \n\nOur house wasn't too far away from Isaac's house, and when I went to my window, I could see the corpse as it carried him through the streets. It had him by the front of his shirt, Isaac beating at him as he carried him towards the plaza where he had first been seen. Others were looking out their windows, watching the grim procession as it made its way through the streets. Despite the horror, many of us put on our robes and shoes and ran to see where the shade was taking Isaac.\n\nAs he came into the plaza, it was hard for the crowd to ignore the blood that was oozing from him, his pours excreting his thick and tarish juices.\n\nMiss Trayda, standing amongst the crowd by then, didn't have to tell them what that meant.\n\nIsaac had already begun confessing his sin again and again for all to hear.\n\nUpon hearing his brother confess, it was as though the shade folded in on itself. \n\nHe collapsed, dropping Isaac, and lying dead on the cobbles of the plaza.\n\nThe constables arrested him immediately, and I watched him beg for forgiveness as they hung him three months later. His lawyer drug out the proceedings, claiming that evidence provided by a corpse was not what modern justice was about, but the number of people who had heard him confess in the plaza was inarguable. Isaac himself plead guilty, despite his lawyers pleading for him to be silent, and he refused to leave the jail until he was led to the gallows. I heard he told people that Victor's shade visited his window every night, and he was afraid to leave the jail, fearing it might come after him again.\n\nA hundred people saw Victor's corpse bleed that night, a hundred or more, and they all lived in fear of the shade for nearly a month.\n\nThat was, thankfully, the only time I saw a corpse walk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegina and I looked at each other, both of us trying to see if the other really believed her?\n\nAs I lay here now, Regina snoring thinly beside me, I can say that whether I believe it or not, it's a story that will follow me for quite some time."

        "selftext": "*OP's note: the following is a true personal story of mine. Having posted this story previously on other subreddits, this story was accused of being fictional. However, the following events did in fact happen, regardless of if anything supernatural was\/wasn't at play. I do write fictional stories, and if this was one of them, I'd say so.*\n\nFor the past two and a half years now, I have been living in the north of the Scottish Highlands - and when I say north, I mean as far north as you can possibly go. I live in a region called Caithness, in the small coastal town of Thurso, which is actually the northernmost town on the British mainland. I had always wanted to live in the Scottish Highlands, which seemed a far cry from my gloomy hometown in Yorkshire, England – and when my dad and his partner told me they’d bought an old house up here, I jumped at the opportunity! From what they told me, Caithness sounded like the perfect destination. There were seals and otters in the town’s river, Dolphins and Orcas in the sea, and at certain times of the year, you could see the Northern Lights in the night sky. But despite my initial excitement of finally getting to live in the Scottish Highlands, full of beautiful mountains, amazing wildlife and vibrant culture... I would soon learn the region I had just moved to, was far from the idyllic destination I had dreamed of...\n\nSo many tourists flood here each summer, but when you actually choose to live here, in a harsh and freezing coastal climate... this place feels more like a purgatory. More than that... this place actually feels cursed... This probably just sounds like superstition on my part, but what almost convinces me of this belief, more so than anything else here... is that disturbing things have washed up on shore, each one supposedly worse than the last... and they all have to do with death...\n\n*They were littered everywhere*\n\nThe first thing I discovered here happened maybe a couple of months after I first moved to Caithness. In my spare time, I took to exploring the coastline around the Thurso area. It was on one of these days that I started to explore what was east of Thurso. On the right-hand side of the mouth of the river, there’s an old ruin of a castle – but past that leads to a cliff trail around the eastern coastline. I first started exploring this trail with my dog, Maisie, on a very windy, rainy day. We trekked down the cliff trail and onto the bedrocks by the sea, and making our way around the curve of a cliff base, we then found something...\n\nLittered all over the bedrock floor, were what seemed like dozens of dead seabirds... They were everywhere! It was as though they had just fallen out of the sky and washed ashore! I just assumed they either crashed into the rocks or were swept into the sea due to the stormy weather. Feeling like this was almost a warning, I decided to make my way back home, rather than risk being blown off the cliff trail.\n\nIt wasn’t until a day or so after, when I went back there to explore further down the coast, that a woman with her young daughter stopped me. Shouting across the other side of the road through the heavy rain, the woman told me she had just come from that direction - but that there was a warning sign for dog walkers, warning them the area was infested with dead seabirds, that had died from bird flu. She said the warning had told dog walkers to keep their dogs on a leash at all times, as bird flu was contagious to them. This instantly concerned me, as the day before, my dog Maisie had gotten close to the dead seabirds to sniff them.\n\nBut there was something else. Something about meeting this woman had struck me as weird. Although she was just a normal woman with her young daughter, they were walking a dog that was completely identical to Maisie: a small black and white Border Collie. Maybe that’s why the woman was so adamant to warn me, because in my dog, she saw her own, heading in the direction of danger. But why this detail was so weird to me, was because it almost felt like an omen of some kind. She was leading with her dog, identical to mine, away from the contagious dead birds, as though I should have been doing the same. It almost felt as though it wasn’t just the woman who was warning me, but something else - something disguised as a coincidence.\n\nCurious as to what this warning sign was, I thanked the woman for letting me know, before continuing with Maisie towards the trail. We reached the entrance of the castle ruins, and on the entrance gate, I saw the sign she had warned me about. The sign was bright yellow and outlined with contagion symbols. If the woman’s warning wasn’t enough to make me turn around, this sign definitely was – and so I head back into town, all the while worrying that my dog might now be contagious. Thankfully, Maisie would be absolutely fine.\n\nAlthough I would later learn that bird flu was common to the region, and so dead seabirds wasn’t anything new, what I would stumble upon a year later, washed up on the town’s beach, would definitely be far more sinister...\n\n*It looked like the Devil*\n\nIn the summer of the following year, like most days, I walked with Maisie along the town’s beach, which stretched from one end of Thurso Bay to the other. I never really liked this beach, because it was always covered in stacks of seaweed, which not only stunk of sulphur, but attracted swarms of flies and midges. Even if they weren’t on you, you couldn’t help but feel like you were being bitten all over your body. The one thing I did love about this beach, was that on a clear enough day, you could see in the distance one of the Islands of Orkney. On a more cloudy or foggy day, it was as if this particular island was never there to begin with, and all you instead see is the ocean and a false horizon.\n\nOn one particular summer’s day, I was walking with Maisie along this beach. I had let her off her lead as she loved exploring and finding new smells from the ocean. She was rummaging through the stacks of seaweed when suddenly, Maisie had found something. I went to see what it was, and I realized it was something I’d never seen before... What we found, lying on top of a layer of seaweed, was an animal skeleton... I wasn’t sure what animal it belonged to exactly, but it was either a sheep or a goat. There were many farms in Caithness and across the sea in Orkney. My best guess was that an animal on one of Orkney’s coastal farms must have fallen off a ledge or cliff, drown and its remains eventually washed up here.\n\nAlthough I was initially taken back by this skeleton, grinning up at me with its molar-like teeth, something else about this animal quickly caught my eye. The upper-body was indeed skeletal remains, completely picked white clean... but the lower-body was all still there... It still had its hoofs and all its wet fur. The fur was dark grey and as far as I could see, all the meat underneath was still intact. Although disturbed by this carcass, I was also very confused... What I didn’t understand was, why had the upper-body of this animal been completely picked off, whereas the lower part hadn’t even been touched? What was weirder, the lower-body hadn’t even decomposed yet. It still looked fresh.\n\nI can still recollect the image of this dead animal in my mind’s eye. At the time, one of the first impressions I had of it, was that it seemed almost satanic. It reminded me of the image of Baphomet: a goat’s head on a man’s body. What made me think this, was not only the dark goat-like legs, but also the position the carcass was in. Although the carcass belonged to a goat or sheep, the way the skeleton was positioned almost made it appear hominid. The skeleton was laid on its back, with an arm and leg on each side of its body.\n\nHowever, what I also have to mention about this incident, is that, like the dead sea birds and the warnings of the concerned woman, this skeleton also felt like an omen. A bad omen! I thought it might have been at the time, and to tell you the truth... it was. Not long after finding this skeleton washed up on the town’s beach, my personal life suddenly takes a very dark, and somewhat tragic downward spiral... I almost wish I could go into the details of what happened, as it would only support the idea of how much of a bad omen this skeleton would turn out to be... but it’s all rather personal.\n\nWhile I’ve still lived in this God-forsaken place, I have come across one more thing that has washed ashore – and although I can’t say whether it was more, or less disturbing than the Baphomet-like skeleton I had found... it was definitely bone-chilling!\n\n*What happened to the skulls?*\n\nSix or so months later and into the Christmas season, I was still recovering from what personal thing had happened to me – almost foreshadowed by the Baphomet skeleton. It was also around this time that I’d just gotten out of a long-distance relationship, and was only now finding closure from it. Feeling as though I had finally gotten over it, I decided I wanted to go on a long hike by myself along the cliff trail east of Thurso. And so, the day after Christmas – Boxing Day, I got my backpack together, packed a lunch for myself and headed out at 6 am.\n\nThe hike along the trail had taken me all day, and by the evening, I had walked so far that I actually discovered what I first thought was a ghost town. What I found was an abandoned port settlement, which had the creepiest-looking disperse of old stone houses, as well as what looked like the ruins of an ancient round-tower. As it turned out, this was actually the Castletown heritage centre – a tourist spot. It seemed I had walked so far around the rugged terrain, that I was now 10 miles outside of Thurso. On the other side of this settlement were the distant cliffs of Dunnet Bay, which compared to the cliffs I had already trekked along, were far grander. Although I could feel my legs finally begin to give way, and already anticipating a long journey back along the trail, I decided that I was going to cross the bay and reach the cliffs - and then make my way back home... Considering what I would find there... this is the point in the journey where I should have stopped.\n\nBy the time I was making my way around the bay, it had become very dark. I had already walked past more than half of the bay, but the cliffs didn’t feel any closer. It was at this point when I decided I really needed to turn around, as at night, walking back along the cliff trail was going to be dangerous - and for the parts of the trail that led down to the base of the cliffs, I really couldn’t afford for the tide to cut off my route.\n\nI made my way back through the abandoned settlement of the heritage centre, and at night, this settlement definitely felt more like a ghost town. Shining my phone flashlight in the windows of the old stone houses, I was expecting to see a face or something peer out at me. What surprisingly made these houses scarier at night, were a handful of old fishing boats that had been left outside them. The wood they were made from looked very old and the paint had mostly been weathered off. But what was more concerning, was that in this abandoned ghost town of a settlement, I wasn’t alone. A van had pulled up, with three or four young men getting out. I wasn’t sure what they were doing exactly, but they were burning things into a trash can. What it was they were burning, I didn’t know - but as I made my way out of the abandoned settlement, every time I looked back at the men by the van, at least one of them were watching me. The abandoned settlement. The creepy men burning things by their van... That wasn’t even the creepiest thing I came across on that hike. The creepiest thing I found actually came as soon as I decided to head back home – before I was even back at the heritage centre...\n\nFinally making my way back, I tried retracing my own footprints along the beach. It was so dark by now that I needed to use my phone flashlight to find them. As I wandered through the darkness, with only the dim brightness of the flashlight to guide me... I came across something... Ahead of me, I could see a dark silhouette of something in the sand. It was too far away for my flashlight to reach, but it seemed to me that it was just a big rock, so I wasn’t all too concerned. But for some reason, I wasn’t a hundred percent convinced either. The closer I get to it, the more I think it could possibly be something else.\n\nI was right on top of it now, and the silhouette didn’t look as much like a rock as I thought it did. If anything, it looked more like a very big fish – almost like a tuna fish. I didn’t even realize fish could get that big in and around these waters. Still unsure whether this was just a rock or a dead fish of sorts – but too afraid to shine my light on it, I decided I was going to touch it with my foot. My first thought was that I was going to feel hard rock beneath me, only to realize the darkness had played a trick on me. I lift up my foot and press it on the dark silhouette, but what I felt wasn't hard rock... It was squidgy...\n\nMy first reaction was a little bit of shock, because if this wasn’t a rock like I originally thought, then it was something else – and had probably once been alive. Almost afraid to shine my light on whatever this was, I finally work up the courage to do it. Hoping this really is just a very big fish, I reluctantly shine my light on the dark squidgy thing... But what the light reveals is something else... It was a seal... A dead seal pup.\n\nSeal carcasses do occasionally wash up in this region, and it wasn’t even the first time I saw one. But as I studied this dead seal with my flashlight, feeling my own skin crawl as I did it, I suddenly noticed something – something alarming... This seal pup had a chunk of flesh bitten out of it... For all I knew, this poor seal pup could have been hit by a boat, and that’s what caused the wound. But the wound was round and basically a perfect bite shape... Depending on the time of year, there are orcas around these waters, which obviously hunt seals - but this bite mark was no bigger than what a fully-grown seal could make... Did another seal do this? I know other animals will sometimes eat their young, but I never heard of seals doing this... But what was even worse than the idea that this pup was potentially killed by its own species, was that this pup, this poor little seal pup... was missing its skull...\n\nNot its head. It’s skull! The skin was all still there, but it was empty, lying flat down against the sand. Just when I think it can’t get any worse than this, I leave the seal to continue making my way back, when I come across another dark silhouette in the sand ahead. I go towards it, and what I find is another dead seal pup... But once more, this one also had an identical wound – a fatal bite mark. And just like the other one... the skull was missing...\n\nI could accept that they’d been killed by either a boat, or more likely from the evidence, an attack from another animal... but how did both of these seals, with the exact same wounds in the exact same place, also have both of their skulls missing? I didn’t understand it. These seals hadn’t been ripped apart – they only had one bite mark each. Would the seal, or seals that killed them really remove their skulls? I didn’t know. I still don’t - but what I do know is that both of these carcasses were identical. Completely identical – which was strange. They had clearly died the same way. I more than likely knew how they died... but what happened to their skulls?\n\nAs it happens, it’s actually common for seal carcasses to be found headless. Apparently, if they have been tumbling around in the surf for a while, the head can detach from the body before washing ashore. The only other answer I could find was scavengers. Sometimes other animals will scavenge the body and remove the head. What other animals that was, I wasn't sure - but at least now, I had more than one explanation as to why these seal pups were missing their skulls... even if I didn’t know which answer that was.\n\nAlthough I had now reasoned out the cause of these missing skulls, it still struck me as weird as to how these seal pups were almost identical to each other in their demise. Maybe one of them could lose their skulls – but could they really both?... I suppose so... Unlike the other things I found washed ashore, these dead seals thankfully didn’t feel like much of an omen. This was just a common occurrence to the region. But growing up most of my life in Yorkshire, England, where nothing ever happens, and suddenly moving to what seemed like the edge of the world, and finding mutilated remains of animals you only ever saw in zoos... it definitely stays with you...\n\nFor the past two and a half years that I’ve been here, I almost do feel as though this region is cursed. Not only because of what I found washed ashore – after all, dead things wash up here all the time... I almost feel like this place is cursed for a number of reasons. Despite the natural beauty all around, this place does somewhat feel like a purgatory. A depressive place that attracts lost souls from all around the UK.\n\nMany of the locals leave this place, migrating far down south to places like Glasgow. On the contrary, it seems a fair number of people, like me, have come from afar to live here – mostly retired English couples, who for some reason, choose this place above all others to live comfortably before the day they die... Perhaps like me, they thought this place would be idyllic, only to find out they were wrong... For the rest of the population, they’re either junkies or convicted criminals, relocated here from all around the country... If anything, you could even say that Caithness is the UK’s Alaska - where people come to get far away from their past lives or even themselves, but instead, amongst the natural beauty, are harassed by a cold, dark, depressing climate.\n\nMaybe this place isn’t actually cursed. Maybe it really is just a remote area in the far north of Scotland - that has, for UK standards, a very unforgiving climate... Regardless, I won’t be here for much longer... Maybe the ghosts that followed me here will follow wherever I may end up next...\n\nA fair bit of warning... if you do choose to come here, make sure you only come in the summer... But whatever you do... if you have your own personal demons of any kind... whatever you do... just don’t move here."

        "selftext": "Jake was a cashier at a liquor store in the college district of town. Last Call Liquors, opened eleven am to midnight. It was a great gig, with its relaxed environment, non demanding labor, and a decent discount on bottles. By the very nature of the store, you get a decent amount of interesting and shady characters rolling through. From construction workers picking up their daily rotgut vodka to drink on the job, to wine moms stopping in to buy their box wine, and everything in between. One guy in particular would come in almost every day and buy a fifth of this cinnamon liqueur with flakes of gold in it. In the year that Jake had been working there, that guy had spent over twenty five thousand dollars on gold flake liqueur alone. Seriously, what a freak.\n\nLater on in the shift every week night, at the ten to twelve home stretch, customers came in a slow trickle. You get a college kid here, a shady looking guy there, sprinkle in a few homeless people for good measure. The checkout counter was Jake’s refuge. On a raised platform, he looked down on most customers. To the left of the check out counter was the window leading outside, as well as the glass door set in the middle. When the nights dragged, Jake would just stare out of the large window and watch the traffic roll by. \n\nEverything was peaceful, until he started showing up. It started innocuously enough. Just a man peeking in from the sidewalk. His hands raised to the sides of his face to block out the glare from the street lights outside. He had a beanie, a hoodie with the hood up, dark sunken eyes and a full beard that was mostly gray. Jake never once saw him walk up. He was always just there. Every time Jake went to shoo him away, the man would drop down below the window ledge and vanish. He only popped up once or twice a night, but damn was it unsettling.\n\nThe first couple of nights, Jake just accepted it as the price of doing business. Weirdos and liquor stores go together like Diddy and Diddying. But as the week went on, it began to chip away at Jake’s cool. The bum would appear, and Jake would rush to the door. If he wouldn’t leave Jake alone, he was getting his ass kicked. As soon as Jake lunged forward though, there he went. Shooting straight down under the window sill like a God damned whack a mole.\n\nFriday night, Jake had had enough. Picking up his phone, he decided to let the cops handle this.\n\n“Nine one one, what is your location?”\n\n“Hey, I’m at Last call liquors across from the college.” Jake said, staring down the bum outside.\n“There is a man that won’t leave store property and I would like him trespassed.”\n\n“No problem Sir. Officers are enroute to your location.”\n\nJake put the phone down, took a seat, and had a staring contest with his secret admirer. The police station wasn’t far, so it was no less than three minutes before a cop car pulled into the parking lot. As soon as the cop car pulled up though, the man dipped down under the ledge like usual. \n\n“Yeah, good luck with that, bud.” Jake chuckled.\n\nThe window was fully within line of sight with the officers pulling in, and the liquor store sat dead in the middle of a small strip mall. Oddly enough, the officer got out of his car and walked directly into the store. \n\n“Hey, bud, it was that guy, right there outside the window,” Jake said, his voice shaky as he pointed at the empty spot just beyond the glass.\n\nThe officer squinted, giving Jake a tired look. “What guy?”\n“The guy who was staring in, watching me, right as you pulled up!”\n\n“Sir,” the officer said slowly, a hint of annoyance in his voice, “there wasn’t anyone outside when I got here.”\n\nJake’s face tightened in frustration. “I’m telling you, I sat here eye-fucking him for a solid five minutes, waiting for you to pull in. I didn’t take my eyes off him.”\n\nThe officer blinked, caught off guard. “You… did what?”\n\n“I kept him in my line of sight!” Jake said, louder this time. “He’s been showing up every night for the past week, sticking his face against the window like he’s waiting for something.”\n\nThe officer crossed his arms, an eyebrow raised in silent skepticism. “Have you been drinking tonight?” he asked, his voice a mix of caution and irritation as his hand moved to his hip.\n\n“No, sir,” Jake replied, clenching his jaw. “I’ve been working my shift, like always, when that guy popped up again.”\n\nThe officer sighed and finally looked around, glancing over his shoulder with a half-hearted shrug. “Look, I’ll check around outside, alright? But if he’s really out there, you call us again. We’ll come back and see what we can find if there’s anything to find.”\n\nAs the officer walked off, Jake’s fists tightened at his sides. It was as if he were watching the last thread of his sanity unravel, one shift at a time.\n\nThe next night, it was pouring down rain, to the point that Jake could barely see outside. Maybe that pervert will finally take a day off. Jake knew if he were a creep that stared at liquor store cashiers through the window late at night, that he wouldn't want to be standing in that downpour, but that might just be him.\n\n Jake looked down at his phone and noticed that it was 11:50 PM, his favorite time to stock the shelves. He opened up a box of vodka and started topping off one of the shelves. Out of the corner of his eye, there he was, standing outside like usual. Except, this time he wasn’t leaning against the window. He was standing straight up. As a matter of fact, he looked a little too dry to blend in to the absolutely biblical amount of rain outside.Then, as Jake focused a little more, He noticed that the man looked a little too faint to actually be outside. It kind of looked like…\n\na reflection.\n\nJake spun around just in time for the knife to go clean into his lower gut. He was face to face with the man, his sour breath coming in heavy heaves as he twisted the knife. Jake stumbled back, taking the knife with him. He took two steps back before he tripped over the box of vodka on the floor, cracking the back of his head on the linoleum. Dazed and his stomach on fire, Jake stared at the tile ceiling, only for a second before trying to sit up. It felt as if… well it felt as if there was a knife in his gut. Jake fell back down writhing in agony, blood pooling and smearing the white tiles.\nJake finally came to his senses and snapped back to where the bum was. Nowhere. He just wasn’t there. \n\nWhat was still there was the knife sticking out of Jake's stomach somewhere right below his belly button. After a few moments to gather his strength, Jake began to drag himself back to the counter where his phone sat. As he made his way across the cold floor leaving a trail of crimson, Jake began losing consciousness. His arms are no longer strong enough to pull his weight. Speaking of weight, everything just felt so… heavy. Jake collapsed, blood spreading like dark ink across the cold, white tile, pooling beneath him as the store’s fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare on his final moments.\n\nThe last thing Jake saw, darkness closing in from the edge of his vision, was a face, hands to each side, pressed tightly against the outside of the window. Rain falling heavily around him. He was watching, with a smile on his face. \n\nThe clock on the wall hit twelve am. Time to close."

        "selftext": "You ever have one of those moments where you question if what’s happening to you is real? Like, not just a bad dream, but something deeper? Something that makes you wonder if your entire reality is just… wrong?\n\nI don’t tell many people this, but a few months ago, something happened to me. Something I still can’t explain, and the more I try to figure it out, the more lost I feel. Maybe talking about it will help, but honestly, I’m not sure anymore.\n\nIt started on a Friday night, late—around 1 AM. I was driving home from a friend’s place. The streets were dead quiet, and I was just listening to the hum of my engine and the occasional static from the radio. It was one of those nights where everything feels surreal, like the world is asleep and you’re the only one left.\n\nI was only a few miles from home when I saw it. A car on the side of the road, hazard lights flashing. It was a dark sedan, looked pretty old, and there was a guy standing next to it, waving me down. I should’ve kept driving. I don’t know why I didn’t. I mean, it was late, middle of nowhere, and something about the way he was waving felt… off. But I pulled over.\n\nThe guy looked normal enough, wearing a jacket, jeans, but when I rolled down my window, he just stared at me for a second—like he wasn’t expecting me to stop.\n\n“Everything okay?” I asked.\n\nHe blinked, as if coming out of a trance, and nodded. “Yeah, yeah. Uh, my car broke down. Think you could give me a ride to the gas station?”\n\nNow, normally I’m cautious. But something about him made me feel like I had to help. Like there was no other option. So I unlocked the door, and he got in.\n\nWe didn’t talk much. He didn’t tell me his name, and I didn’t ask. But after a few minutes, I started feeling… weird. Like I was being watched, but not by him. By something else. I glanced in my rearview mirror, and for a split second, I swear I saw someone in the backseat. Just a shape—barely there, but enough to make my heart race.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I just kept driving.\n\nThen, about five minutes in, the guy turns to me and says, “I’ve been here before.”\n\n“What?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nHe looked at me, his face completely blank. “This exact drive. This exact moment. You picked me up before.”\n\nI laughed nervously, thinking maybe he was messing with me. “Yeah, I doubt that. Must’ve been someone else.”\n\nHe shook his head slowly. “No. It was you. And I’ll prove it.”\n\nThat’s when he started describing things. Not just general stuff, but specific details. He knew what I had in my glove compartment—a receipt from a coffee shop I’d been to earlier that day. He described the air freshener hanging from my mirror, the little tear in the fabric of my passenger seat.\n\nI hadn’t shown him any of that. There’s no way he could’ve known.\n\nMy stomach was in knots, and I wanted to pull over, kick him out, but something kept me driving. I felt trapped, like no matter what I did, I had to keep going.\n\nThen, he said something that still chills me to the bone. “This is the part where you try to drop me off at the gas station, but you never make it.”\n\n“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked, my voice shaking now. I glanced at the GPS. The gas station was only a mile away. I could see the lights up ahead.\n\nHe smiled, this slow, creeping smile that made my skin crawl. “You’ve already done this. Over and over again. Every time you try to get there, something happens. Something stops you. And you end up right back where you started.”\n\nI didn’t believe him. I couldn’t. But when I looked at the road ahead, something changed. The gas station lights flickered, and then… they were gone. The road stretched out endlessly in front of me, no buildings, no signs, just darkness. Like the world had shifted, and I was the only one who noticed.\n\n“I don’t understand,” I muttered, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.\n\n“You’re stuck,” he said softly. “You’ve been stuck for a long time. You just don’t remember.”\n\nI slammed on the brakes, heart pounding, and turned to face him. But he wasn’t there. The passenger seat was empty.\n\nI stared, my breath coming in shallow gasps. How the hell could he have just disappeared? I looked around, frantically searching for any sign of him. But then I noticed something even worse.\n\nThe road outside my window… I recognized it. But not from earlier in the night. From last week. Last month. It was the same stretch of road I’d been driving on every Friday for the past few months, on my way home from my friend’s place. Always late at night. Always alone.\n\nI slammed the gas pedal, trying to get back to the city, to any sign of life. But the road just kept stretching on, endlessly. I felt like I was driving for hours, but nothing changed. It was as if the world outside the car didn’t exist anymore—just an infinite loop of the same road, the same dark horizon.\n\nAnd then my phone buzzed. I fumbled for it, nearly dropping it in my panic. There was a new message from an unknown number. It said:\n\n“Welcome back.”\n\nThat’s when I knew. I’d been here before. Just like he said. And I’ll be here again.\n\nSo now I’m telling you—whoever’s listening to this—if you ever find yourself driving late at night, and you see someone stranded on the side of the road… don’t stop. Keep going. No matter what you feel, no matter how much you think they need help—don’t stop.\n\nBecause once you do… you’re never getting out."

        "selftext": "\n\nWhen I moved in with Grandma about five years ago, I didn’t know what to expect.\n\n\n\nGrandma had been living alone since Grandpa died earlier that year, and when they diagnosed her with dementia when I was a senior in high school it seemed like a bad omen. Though they had caught it early, the doctors had suggested that living alone would probably only help her condition deteriorate faster. \n\n\n\n“Dementia patients often see their condition slow when they have company. Your mother has lived alone since your father died, and if someone were able to live with her, I think the ability to have someone to talk to would help her immensely.” \n\n\n\nMom and Dad had looked at each other, not sure what to do about the situation, but seemed to come to a decision pretty quickly. With me looking at college and them unable to afford housing in the dorms, they offered me a compromise. Live with my Grandma and attend college nearby or spend some time trying to get scholarships and grants to pay for my own housing. Grandma and I had always been close, and she was delighted to let me stay with her while I attended college. There was no worry that I would sneak boys in or throw parties, I wasn’t really someone who did that sort of thing, and they knew that I would be home most evenings studying or resting for the coming day.\n\n\n\nI moved in at the beginning of the academic year, and that meant I was there for Halloween. \n\n\n\nGrandma and I had been living pretty harmoniously, only butting heads a few times when I came home late from classes. Grandma liked to be in bed by nine and she didn’t like to be woken up when I came in late. Grandma liked to spend most of her time in bed, watching TV and knitting, but I still came in when I had the chance to talk with her and visit. Some days she knew who I was, some days she thought I was my Mom, but she was never hostile or confused with me. If she called me by my Mom’s name, I was Clare, and if she called me by my name, then I was Julia. Either way, we talked about our day and about life in general. I learned a lot of family secrets that way, things that she was surprised I didn’t remember, and I was glad for this time with her while she was still lucid.\n\n\n\nSo when I came in to find her putting candy in a bowl, I was shocked she was out of bed. She was huffing and puffing, clearly exhausted, and I wondered when she’d had time to buy the candy? She didn’t drive, didn’t have a car, and I didn’t remember buying it. She looked up happily, holding the bowl out to me in greeting.\n\n\n\n“Clare, there you are! I wanted to hand candy out to the kids, but I feel so weak. I must be coming down with something, but I can’t disappoint the kiddos.”\n\n\n\nGrandma seemed to forget that she was pushing sixty-five and not in what anyone would call good health. When she did too much and ran out of energy, she always said she “must be coming down with something” and took herself off to bed to rest, and it seemed to be her mind's way of explaining it. Somehow, it seemed, I had forgotten it was Halloween, but Grandma hadn’t. It wasn’t that surprising, if there was one thing you could count on Grandma to remember, it was Halloween. Grandma had always been in love with Halloween, at least according to Mom. She’d insisted I decorate earlier in the month, had made us get a pumpkin from the store which I then carved and set on the stoop, and if she had been in better health, she would have likely been in costume handing out candy. \n\n\n\nAs it stood, she was lucky to have made it from her room to the table, and I knew it. I took the bowl and told her not to worry, and that I would make sure the kids got their candy. She thanked me and went to lie down, her energy spent. I went to the porch to put out the bowl of candy. I put a note on the stool so the kids knew it was a two-piece limit, and came back in to study.\n\n \n\nToday might be sugar palooza for the little goblins out in the street, but for me, tomorrow was chem midterm and I needed to study. I was doing well, but this was only freshman year. I had big dreams and they would be harder to fulfill with poor marks in chemistry. I heard the kids shrieking and giggling as they came up the road, heard their footsteps on the porch, heard the step pause in speculation as they read the sign, and then heard them retreat after they took their candy. Grandma lived in a fairly nice area and the kiddos seemed used to the two-piece rule. I’m sure some of them took a handful and ran, but they seemed to be in the minority if they did. \n\nIt was dark out, probably pushing nine, when I heard a knock on the door. I looked up from my book, peering at the door as I saw the outline of a little kid in a ghost costume. He was standing there patiently, bag in hand, and I wondered how he had missed the bowl and the sign. Maybe he was looking for an authentic experience, or maybe he was special needs. Either way, I got up and walked over to the door to see what he wanted. \n\n\n\nI opened the door to find a kid in an honest-to-God bedsheet ghost costume. He looked right out of a Charlie Brown special, and the shoes poking out from the bottom looked like loafers. He held a grubby pillow case in one hand and a candy apple in the other, and when he looked up at me through the holes in his sheet, I almost laughed. He looked like a caricature, like a memory of a Halloween long ago, and I wasn’t sure he would speak for a moment.\n\n\n\nWhen he did, I wished he hadn’t.\n\n\n\nHis voice was raspy, unused, and it sucked all the joy out of me.\n\n\n\n“Is Mady here?” he asked, and I shook my head as I tried to get my own voice to work.\n\n\n\n“Na, sorry kiddo, there’s no Mady here.”\n\n\n\nHe nodded, and then turned and left with slow, somber steps.\n\n\n\nI thought it was odd, he hadn’t even taken any candy, and when I closed the door and went back to my work I was filled with a strange and unexplainable sense of dread.\n\n\n\nI had forgotten about it by the time Halloween rolled around again, but the little ghost hadn’t forgotten about us.\n\n\n\nOctober thirty first found me, once again, sitting at the table and studying for a midterm. I was still working on my prerequisites for Biochem, and, if everything went as planned, I’d be starting the course next year. Grandma was much the same, maybe a little more tired and a little more forgetful, but we still spent a lot of evenings chatting and watching TV. Sometimes she braided my hair, and sometimes she showed me how to knit, but we always spent at least an hour together every evening. Tonight she had turned in early, saying she was really tired and wanted to get some rest before this cold caught up to her. I had sat the candy bowl on the front porch, careful to add the usual note, and when someone knocked on the door at eight-thirty, I looked up to see the same little silhouette I had seen the year before.\n\n\n\nI got up, telling myself it couldn’t be the same kid, but when I opened the door, there he was. The same bed sheet ghost costume. The same pho leather loafers. The same bulge around the eyes to indicate glasses. The same slightly dirty pillowcase. It was him, just as he had been the year before, and I almost prayed he would remember before speaking. \n\n\n\n“Is Mady here?” he asked in the same croaking voice, and I tried not to shudder as I smiled down at him.\n\n\n\n“Sorry, kiddo. Wrong house.”\n\n\n\nHe nodded solemnly, turning around and slowly walking back up the front walk as he made his way back to the street. I watched him go, not quite sure what to make of this strange little ghost boy or his apparent lack of growth. The kid looked like he might be about five or six, though his voice sounded like he might be five or six years in his grave. I briefly considered that he might be a real ghost, but I put that out of my mind. It was the time of year, nothing more. I went back to studying, finishing out the evening by visiting with Grandma when she got up from her nap unexpectedly. We drank cocoa and watched a scary movie and I fell asleep beside her in the bed she had once shared with Grandpa.\n\n\n\nThe next year saw the return of the little ghost boy, and he was unchanging. I tried to ask him why he kept coming back after being told she wasn’t here for two years running. I wanted to ask him why he thought she was here, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask him anything. There was a barrier between us that went deeper than a misunderstanding, and it was like we were standing on opposite sides of a gulf and shouting at each other over the tide. He left when I didn’t say anything, nodding and turning like he always did before disappearing into the crowd. \n\n\n\nI didn’t see him the year after that, but, to be fair, I was a little preoccupied. \n\n\n\nThat was my fourth year in college, and I was only a year from graduating and moving on to work in the field of Biochemistry. I had been heading home when a colleague of mine invited me to a little department party. I was helping my teacher as a TA and the other TAs were having a little get-together in honor of the season. I started to decline, but I thought it might be fun. I had never really allowed myself to get into the college scene, never really partied or hung out with friends, and all that focus takes a toll sometimes. I hadn’t really been to a social gathering since High School, and I was curious to see what it was like.\n\n\n\nI’ll admit, I indulged a little more than I should have, but when I came home and found my Grandmother lying by the front door it sobbered me up pretty quickly.\n\n\n\nHer Doctor said that she had fallen when she tried to get to the door, and I couldn’t help but wonder if she had been going to answer the knocking of a certain little ghost boy. They kept her in the hospital for nearly three months, monitoring her and making sure she hadn’t given herself brain damage or something. Her condition progressed while she was in the hospital, and after a time she either only recognized me as my mother or didn’t recognize me at all. She began asking for Alby, always looking for Alby, but I didn’t know who that was. Mom was puzzled too, wondering if maybe she was talking about her Dad, whose name had been Albert.\n\n\n\n“I’ve never heard her call him Alby, but I suppose it could be a nickname. They knew each other as children so it's entirely possible.”\n\n\n\nAfter a while, they sent her home, but the prognosis was not good. They gave her less than a year to live, saying she would need round-the-clock care from now on. I didn’t need to be asked this time. I felt guilty for not being there and I knew that I had to be there for her now. I took a leave of absence from school, putting my plans on hold so I could take care of my Grandma. I continued to take some courses online, hoping to not get too far behind, but I devoted most of my time to her. She was mostly unresponsive, whispering sometimes as she called out for Alby or her mother and father, great-grandparents I had never met. She talked to Alby about secret places and hidden treasures, and her voice was that of a little girl now. She had regressed even more, and every day that I woke up to find her breathing was a blessing.\n\n\n\nGrandma proved them wrong, and when Halloween came around again, I was in for a surprise.\n\n\n\nI had taken to sleeping on a cot at the foot of her bed, keeping an ear out for any sounds of trouble, but a loud clatter from the kitchen had me rolling to my feet and looking around in confusion. I looked at the bed and saw she was still in it, so the sound couldn’t have been her. As another loud bang sounded in that direction I was off and moving before I could think better of it. I was afraid that an animal had gotten into the house, no burglar would have made that much noise, and when I came into the kitchen I saw, just for a second, the furry black backside of some cat or dog or maybe a small bear.\n\n\n\nAs it climbed out of the cabinet it had been rooting through, I saw it was a person, though it was certainly a grubby one. It was a little girl, maybe six or seven, and she looked filthy. She was wearing a threadbare black dress with curly-toed shoes and a pointed hat that she scooped off the floor. The longer I watched her, the more I came to understand that she wasn’t really dirty, but had covered herself lightly in stove ashe for some reason. She didn’t seem to have noticed me. She was digging through cupboards and drawers as she searched for whatever it was she was after, leaving destruction in her wake.\n\n\n\n“Hey,” I called out after some of my surprise had faded, “What are you doing?”\n\n\n\nThe girl turned and looked confused as she took me in, “What are you doing here? This is my house, you better leave before my Momma sees you and gets mad.”\n\n\n\nShe continued to look through things, working her way into the living room, and I followed behind her, not sure what to say. Was this a dream? If it was, it was a pretty vivid one. I could feel the carpet beneath my feet, hear the leaky faucet in the kitchen, smell the lunch I had cooked a few hours before. The little girl had wrecked half the living room before I shook off my discomfort and asked her what she was looking for.\n\n\n\nIf this was a dream then I supposed I had to play along.\n\n\n\n“I need my pillowcase, the one with the pumpkin on it. It’s my special Halleeween bag, and I can’t go trick ee treating without it.”\n\n\n\nI opened my mouth to ask where she’d left it, but I stopped suddenly as something occurred to me.\n\n\n\nI had seen that pillowcase before. It had been in Grandma’s closet for ages, and when I had offered to wash it for her, she had shaken her head and said it had too many memories. There was a pumpkin drawn on one side in charcoal, a black cat on the other side, and a witch's hat between them. Someone had sewn strings around the top so it could be pulled shut, and it looked like a grubby peddler's sack. Surely if this was a dream then Grandma wouldn’t mind if I gave this child the bag. Maybe that's why she had been keeping it, just in case this kid came looking for it.\n\n\n\nI told the girl to wait for a minute and that I would get it for her. \n\n\n\n“Okay, but hurry! Halleeween won’t last all night!”\n\n\n\nIt took a little looking, but I finally found it under some old quilts at the top of the closet. At some point, Grandma must have recolored the cat and hat, and I wondered when she’d had the energy? She hadn’t even been out of bed without me by her side in over a year, so she must have done this before her fall. I took the bag out to the living room and held it out to the girl who was leaning against the sofa. Her eyes lit up and she snatched it happily as she danced around and thanked me.\n\n\n\n“Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!” she trumpeted, “Now I can go Trick ee Treating! As soon as,” and as if on cue, a knock came from the door.\n\n\n\nThe little witch ran to answer it, and I was unsurprised to see the little ghost boy waiting for her.\n\n\n\n“Maby!” he said happily, and she wrapped him in a hug like she hadn’t seen him in years.\n\n\n\n“Alby!” she trumpeted in return, “Ready to go?”\n\n\n\n“For ages, slowpoke,” he said, the smile beneath the sheet coming out in his words.\n\n\n\nThe two left the porch hand in hand, disappearing out into the crowd as they went to go trick or treating.\n\n\n\nI watched them go, feeling a mixture of warmth and completion, and that was when I remembered my Grandma. I had left her alone for a long while, and when I went to check on her, I found her too still in her bed. I started to begin CPR, but after putting a couple of fingers to her throat I knew it was too late. She was cold, she had likely been dead before I was awoken by the clatter in the kitchen, and I held back tears as I called the ambulance and let my parents know that she had passed.\n\n\n\nThe funeral was quick, Grandma was laid to rest next to Grandpa, and a week later I was helping Mom clean out Grandma’s house. It was my house now, Grandma had left it to me in her will, and Mom was packing up some mementos and deciding what to donate. We were going through her closet when I found a box with keepsakes in it. There were pictures of my Mom when she was little, wedding photos of Grandma and Grandpa, and some letters Grandpa had written her during Vietnam. Mom came over as I was going through them, smiling at the pictures and crying a little over the letters, but I felt my breath stick in my throat as I came to a very old photo at the bottom of the box.\n\n\n\nIt was a small photo of two kids in costumes on the front porch of a much different house. \n\n\n\nOne was a ghost, his eye holes bulging with glasses, and the other was a witch who had clearly rubbed wood ash on her face.\n\n\n\n“Julia?” Mom asked, the picture shaking in my hand, “Hunny? Are you okay?”\n\n\n\nThe picture fell back into the box, and there on the back was the last piece of the puzzle.\n\n\n\n*Madeline and Albert, Halloween nineteen sixty.* \n\n\n\nThat was the last I saw of the little witch or the ghost, but when Halloween comes to call, the two are never very far from my mind.\n\n\n\nI always hand out candy and decorate the house, just as Grandma would have wanted.\n\n\n\nYou never quite know what sort of ghosts and goblins might come to visit.\n\n"

        "selftext": "I should’ve known something was wrong when Lily started acting strange about that stupid bear. I never liked it, but she always adored it. We found it in the attic one afternoon, covered in dust like most of the stuff up there. It was this old, scruffy teddy bear, the kind with faded fur and button eyes that were just a little too big. But Lily insisted it was hers. She carried it around everywhere, hugging it close, whispering to it like it was her best friend. It had that smell, too—the kind of musty, old smell you get from things that’ve been tucked away for far too long. But she didn’t seem to mind.\n\nI was eleven at the time, and Lily was seven—old enough to know better than to get attached to something that creepy, right? But Lily had always been different. She was quiet, kind of offbeat. A little too friendly with things she couldn’t explain. I guess I should’ve paid more attention to that.\n\nIt started out harmless, just her playing with the bear, calling it “Mr. Fuzzy” like it was a normal stuffed animal. But there was something about the way she looked at it, her eyes always wide, always fixed on it like she was waiting for it to do something. At first, I thought it was just her imagination running wild. She was a kid after all. But then… then things began to change.\n\nLily stopped playing with other toys. She stopped talking to me as much. She wouldn’t let anyone touch Mr. Fuzzy. When I tried to play with her, she’d throw a tantrum, clutching the bear tighter, telling me to leave it alone. At night, she’d cry out in her sleep, her voice strained and shaky. I’d go into her room to check on her, and there she’d be—sitting up in bed, staring at the bear with wide, unblinking eyes, whispering something under her breath that I couldn’t make out.\n\nIt wasn’t just the weirdness with the bear, though. It was the change in her. She used to be so sweet, so giggly, but now… she was different. Moody. Sudden bursts of rage. I remember once she slammed her door so hard it cracked the wood, and when I tried to get her to talk, she just stared at me—her eyes so cold, so empty. It was like I wasn’t even looking at my little sister anymore.\n\nI tried talking to Mom and Dad about it, but they just brushed it off. “She’s just going through a phase,” Mom said, smiling like nothing was wrong. “She’s growing up, honey.” But I knew better. I could feel it, deep in my gut. Something was wrong with that bear. And something was wrong with Lily.\n\nOne night, it was the worst. I woke up to the sound of Lily’s voice, low and whispering, almost like chanting. I got out of bed, the darkness in the hallway making every creak of the floorboards sound a hundred times louder. I peeked into her room, and that’s when I saw it.\n\nLily was sitting on the floor, Mr. Fuzzy in her lap. But she wasn’t holding it like a normal toy. No, she was clutching it, like she was afraid it would slip away, her fingers digging into its fabric, her lips moving so fast, I couldn’t understand the words. The air in the room was heavy, thick with something I couldn’t explain. It felt wrong. The shadows in the corners seemed darker, more… alive.\n\nI stepped forward, calling out to her, but she didn’t hear me. She just kept muttering, over and over again, like she was in some sort of trance.\n\nAnd then, the bear’s eyes—its eyes—they glowed.\n\nI’m not talking about some faint reflection from the moonlight. No. The buttons were glowing, a sickly yellow light, pulsing, like it had a life of its own.\n\nI froze, my heart racing, as I realized something was terribly wrong. Lily looked up at me then, her face expressionless, her eyes empty. “Don’t take him from me,” she whispered, her voice… not hers anymore. It was deeper. Cold.\n\nI backed away, my breath catching in my throat. “Lily, what are you—”\n\n“Don’t take him from me,” she repeated, and this time, her voice wasn’t her voice at all. It was like… like someone else was speaking through her.\n\nBefore I could react, I felt a sudden, sharp tug on my wrist—Mr. Fuzzy was moving. Not just the fabric, not just Lily’s hands, but the bear was… alive. The teddy bear’s body jerked towards me, its little stitched mouth stretching into a smile that wasn’t a smile. It was twisted, something wrong.\n\nI screamed, pulling away from its grip, but my hand wouldn’t budge. It felt like the bear was holding me there, not Lily. And that’s when I saw it—there were marks on her arms, on her neck—red, angry lines like something had been scratching at her skin.\n\nI bolted from the room, running to Mom and Dad’s bedroom, banging on the door, yelling at them to wake up. But when they finally came rushing into the hallway, Lily was… normal.\n\nShe was lying in bed, sleeping soundly, Mr. Fuzzy nestled in her arms like it was the most innocent thing in the world.\n\nI tried to explain everything, but they didn’t believe me. My dad yelled at me and smacked me across the face and slammed his door as him and my mom went back to bed. He said I was imagining things. But I wasn’t. I saw it. I felt it.\n\nThe next few days, things seemed okay again. Lily was back to her usual self—mostly. But I could still feel the presence of the bear. And I could see it in Lily’s eyes—there was something off. I tried to get rid of Mr. Fuzzy. I hid it in the attic again, but the next morning, it was back in her bed, like it had never been gone.\n\nOne day, I couldn’t take it anymore. I went into Lily’s room, took some scissors and cut his head off and each of his limbs and threw them in the dumpster. \n\nLater that night, I woke up to a weird noise from Lily’s room. I got up and slowly opened her door and saw Mr. Fuzzy, completely intact, on the floor with a pair of scissors in his lap. I looked at the bed and noticed Lily was gone. I opened the door fully and looked around her room as I turned the light on. Behind her closet I saw her trash can. Two arms and two legs and a human head. The color drained from my face and I threw up on the floor as I saw my sisters torso next to the trash can. I slowly turned towards the bear that had a sticky note in his lap. Written on it were the words: “You shouldn’t have taken me from her”. "

        "selftext": "When I bought my first home, I was ecstatic. It was a cozy little place on a quiet street—modest, but perfect for a fresh start. The house had been empty for a while, but it seemed to be in good shape. A neighbor, Mrs. Anders, stopped by the day I moved in to welcome me.\n\n“Such a lovely place,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “But just a tip: keep your curtains drawn at night.”\n\nI laughed it off, thinking it was just small-town superstition or a strange quirk of an old neighbor. But every night, I’d look across the street and see Mrs. Anders sitting in her darkened living room, staring directly at my house through a small gap in her own curtains.\n\nI tried to ignore it. After all, people have their habits. But the longer I lived there, the more it unsettled me. She never waved, never nodded, never even blinked. Just sat there, as if watching for something. I started keeping my own curtains closed at night, just like she’d said.\n\nBut a few weeks later, I forgot.\n\nI had been working late, and when I got home, I dumped my bags on the couch and collapsed without thinking. I must’ve left the living room curtains half-open. As I lay on the couch, half-asleep, a soft knock on the glass startled me.\n\nMy blood ran cold.\n\nIt wasn’t the front door; it was my living room window, right next to where I was lying. The knocking came again—three slow taps against the glass. I turned my head, heart hammering, and froze.\n\nOutside, lit only by the dim streetlamp, stood a tall, thin figure. He was just a silhouette, features lost in shadow. But he was pressed up close against the window, his face nearly touching the glass.\n\nI didn’t move. I didn’t dare breathe.\n\nThe figure raised one hand and tapped again. Tap. Tap. Tap. Then he stood still, as if waiting for me to react.\n\nI don’t know how long I stared at him. Finally, mustering all the courage I had, I slowly reached over to the table beside me and grabbed my phone, ready to dial 911. But as soon as I moved, the figure stepped back.\n\nHe waved.\n\nA long, slow, deliberate wave.\n\nThen, without turning, he began to walk—straight toward Mrs. Anders’ house across the street.\n\nI scrambled to my feet and ran to the front door, peeking out through the peephole. I could see the figure making his way to Mrs. Anders’ front yard. But instead of knocking, he just… stood there.\n\nI glanced over at her house, and I finally saw it. There, in her living room window, she was still sitting, staring out at me. Except now, she wasn’t alone. The dark figure was standing right behind her, his face turned toward my house.\n\nHe lifted his hand and waved again.\n\nThe next morning, I called the police. They said Mrs. Anders had passed away in her sleep—probably days ago. I never saw anyone come in or out of her house since I’d moved in. The coroner estimated she’d been dead for at least a week.\n\nBut the night before… I know what I saw.\n\nI sold the house within a month.\n\nI don’t know who the man was or what he wanted. But sometimes, when I’m alone late at night, I still think I see a shadow at the edge of my vision, just outside the window.\n\nI never forget to close my curtains anymore."

        "selftext": "I never told anyone about the things that happened at home. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I couldn’t. Who would believe me? Everyone always told me how lucky I was to have a mom like hers—she was so kind, so loving, so perfect. But they didn’t see what I saw. They never saw her after dark.\n\nIt started when I was about nine. I remember because that was the year everything changed, but I don’t remember exactly when I first noticed. At first, it was little things. Her eyes, when she’d look at me sometimes. It wasn’t the same look she gave me in the daytime. Her eyes would go dark, almost empty, like there was nothing behind them. I’d try to ignore it, but then she’d smile. Not a sweet smile. No, this one was sharp, like she knew something I didn’t. Something she wasn’t telling me.\n\nOne evening, after dinner, she asked me to help her clean up. She always asked, but this time it felt different. Her voice was too soft, too sweet—almost sickly. I went to the kitchen, and as I was wiping the table, I felt her eyes on me. I looked up, and there she was, standing too still by the sink. Her face was pale, her lips curled into that smile again. It was wrong.\n\nI didn’t know why, but I felt a sudden urge to get away from her. I turned to put the rag down, but before I could, her hand shot out, grabbing my arm with a grip so tight it hurt. Her fingers dug into my skin like she was trying to leave a mark.\n\n“Don’t you want to be close to me, sweetheart?” she whispered.\n\nThe words came out in a way that sounded wrong. Not loving. Not comforting. It was like she was testing me, seeing if I would pull away.\n\nI stared at her, frozen. Her smile grew wider, and I could hear the faintest sound of something, like a laugh. A laugh that wasn’t hers. A laugh that was… hollow.\n\n“Mom?” I said, my voice shaky. “You’re hurting me.”\n\nHer grip tightened, her nails biting into my arm, and then, just as suddenly, she let go. Her expression shifted back to normal, like nothing had happened. She blinked a couple of times, looking confused, like she didn’t even know why I was upset.\n\n“What’s wrong, darling?” she asked, the warmth returning to her voice. “Did I hurt you?”\n\nI didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. I didn’t know what to say.\n\nThe next day was fine. She was normal again. Laughing, singing, baking cookies, doing all the things she did to make the house feel like home. But that night, when I went to bed, I heard something strange. It was faint, but it was there. A rustling sound, like someone moving in the hallway.\n\nI froze, listening. It was her—Mom. I could tell by the way the floorboards creaked, just like she always did when she walked. But then I heard something else. A low whisper. Not her voice. Not even close. It was guttural. Almost like someone was mimicking her, but they couldn’t get it right.\n\nI dared a glance out of the crack in my door, just enough to see into the hallway. There she was, standing at the end, staring at the wall. Her head was tilted back unnaturally, almost like her neck was broken. The whispering grew louder, but it wasn’t coming from her. It was coming from inside her.\n\n“Come closer…” the voice hissed. “I want to show you something…”\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to run, but my body wouldn’t move. All I could do was watch as she slowly turned her head—slowly, like it was on a hinge—and met my eyes.\n\nBut they weren’t her eyes. They were dark. Empty. And they were full of rage. They weren’t the eyes of my mother. They were the eyes of something… else.\n\n“What do you see, darling?” she asked, but it wasn’t her voice anymore. It was low, distorted, almost a growl. I could hear the wet sound of saliva in her throat, like she was salivating for something.\n\nThe door burst open, and I screamed. But before I could run, she was there. She was in my face, her cold breath washing over me. I shut my eyes, but I could still feel her. Her fingers curled into my hair, tugging my head back.\n\n“Shhh, baby,” she cooed, her voice now back to normal, like nothing had happened. “It was just a bad dream. You’re safe.”\n\nI wanted to believe her. I wanted so badly to believe her. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t a dream. And I knew that wasn’t her. Whatever it was, it had taken her. Maybe a little bit at a time, or maybe all at once. I don’t know. But it was in her now. And it liked me. It liked to play games with me.\n\nAfter that night, things got worse. It started to happen every night. At first, I tried to tell myself that I was just imagining things—maybe I was just tired, or stressed, or scared. But no. The things she did, the things she said… they weren’t normal. Sometimes I’d wake up and she’d be standing by my bed, her eyes wide open, staring at me as if she was waiting for me to wake up. Other times, she’d be sitting in the living room, not moving at all, like she was frozen in place. But if I spoke, if I even breathed too loud, she’d snap to life, her face lighting up with that smile again.\n\n“You’re so precious to me,” she’d say in that sickly sweet voice, running her fingers through my hair. “So precious… Just like I knew you would be.”\n\nBut I knew better. I knew something was wrong with her. I knew she wasn’t my mom anymore.\n\nI’m 16 now, and I haven’t left the house in weeks. I can’t. I know she’s watching me. Every time I try to leave, every time I even think about it, I hear her voice from the other room, calling my name in that soft, sick voice. Sometimes, I hear that thing that’s pretending to be her, whispering in my ear, telling me that she loves me, that she’s waiting for me to come home.\n\nBut I know the truth.\n\nShe isn’t my mother anymore.\n\nAnd whatever is wearing her face, wearing her skin, is getting closer. I’m typing this under the covers right now and I just heard the door open up. Somebody save me. I’m begging you. "

        "selftext": "Dad was always kind of a weird guy.\n\nWeird and strict.\n\nI always thought this was just because he was a single parent, but even that seemed to only barely cover his odd behavior. He expected the best of me, expected my chores to be done, expected the rules to be followed, and, if I didn't, there was only one punishment that would do. \n\nDad never hit me with a belt, he never spanked me with his hand, he never took my stuff or put me in time out.\n\nNo, Dad had a different sort of punishment he used.\n\nHe didn't introduce the jar until I was six, and it was revealed with a lot of serious contemplation.\n\nI remember coming home from my first day of Kindergarten and finding my Dad sitting in the living room, the jar on the little end table where the magazines and rick rack usually stood. The jar may have begun life as a pickle jar, it always smelled a little of brine, and inside were beans. These were spotted pinto beans, the kind I had used on art projects and crafts since before I could remember, and I noticed they had been filled up to the brim. All in all, there were probably about three bags of beans in there, and a piece of scotch tape declared it to be my jar.\n\n\"Take a seat, we need to have a very serious talk,\" he said, and I ended up just sitting on the floor of our living room and looking up at him. He looked very serious, more serious than I had ever seen him before, and that scared me a bit. Up until now, Dad had always been this goofy guy who played pirates and astronauts and Mario Kart with me, but now he looked like a judge ready to sentence me to death if I didn't have a pretty good defense for my crime.\n\n\"You are six now, long past knowing right from wrong. In this family, it is customary to use The Bean Jar to punish children. Do you see this jar?\" he asked like there was any way I could miss it.\n\nI nodded and he smiled, seeming pleased.\n\n\"The Bean Jar symbolizes You. It is everything you are, and everything you might be. So, from now on, when you are bad, or insolent, or you disobey my orders, I will not yell at you or send you to your room. I won’t do anything but take a bean from The Bean Jar.\"\n\nI almost laughed. Was this a game or something? Was I supposed to be scared of a jar of beans? This had to be another one of Dad's jokes. Dad was always doing stuff like this, telling me how the monsters in my closet could be kept away by a teddy bear or that the Cavity Creeps would eat my teeth if I didn't brush them twice a day. Dad was a goofball, he always had been, but I think it was his face that made me wonder if he was joking or not. Throughout the whole thing, he just sat there, deadly serious, and never averted his eyes from me.\n\n\"You're a smart kid, just like I was, and I see now that you'll need an example. You may think this is just a regular jar, but you're wrong,\" he said, reaching in and picking up a bean, \"dead wrong.\"\n\nHe didn't even take it out. He just lifted a little, hovering it over the pile, but he didn't need to do anything else. Suddenly, miraculously, it felt like someone was touching my brain. It was the feeling of getting a sudden sadness, a sudden bit of anxiety, and I wanted him to drop that bean back in the jar. I needed to be whole, I needed all my beans, and he must have seen that on my face because he dropped it back in and I trembled as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you have to know what's at stake here. You're my last chance, I have to make sure that you are perfect, and the Bean Jar knows perfection from flaw. My own father used this method, and his father, and his father before him. The Bean Jar is always used until the child's eighteenth birthday, or until all the beans are gone.\"\n\nI was panting when I asked him what would happen if all the beans were gone.\n\nHe looked at me without mirth and without any sign of a joke or a goof, \"You don't want to know.\"\n\nThat's how we started with the Bean Jar. Dad didn't suddenly turn into an ogre or become a villain overnight. He went back to being the same guy he'd always been. We would play video games together, build with my Legos, and play pretend after school. My Dad had never scared me like that before, he and I were always really close, but I remember how he would get when he had to take beans out of the jar. His face would become completely neutral, and he would walk to the jar and take out a bean before crushing it between his thumb and forefinger. \n\nThe Bean Jar was utilized even for the most trivial of infractions. \n\nForgot to wash my dishes? Lose a bean.\n\nForgot to put my clothes away? Lose a bean.\n\nStayed up too late on a school night? Lose a bean.\n\nThere was no escalation either. There was never any difference between forgetting to clean up my toys or yelling at Dad because I was frustrated. It was always one bean at a time, ground to dust between his large, calloused fingers. He would look at me too with this mixture of pain and resolve once it was done, his stoicism only going so far.\n\nThose times he took a bean, however, were unbearable. \n\nIt felt as if each bean were a piece of my psyche that he was turning to dust. As a child, every bean made me hyper-aware of my actions, but I was still just a child. Sometimes I forgot things, sometimes I was lazy, and sometimes I thought I could sneak around and get away with not doing what I was told. I was always caught, always punished, and I always fell into a state of anxious, nervous emotions once it was done. I hated the way it felt when he crushed those beans, and I didn't want to lose another one. I didn't want to lose them so badly, that I trained myself to perform the tasks expected of me without fail. Five am: start the laundry. Five twenty: make breakfast. Five Thirty: wash my dishes. Five forty: dress. Six o'clock: clean up my room. Six thirty: backpack on, fully dressed, waiting by the door to leave. Three ten: Get home, do homework. Four thirty: Clean house. Five: Start dinner. Six: Eat dinner when my father got home. Nine o'clock: brush teeth, take a shower. Ninethirty: Bedtime. Every day, without fail, these things were done or I would be one bean shorter.\n\nThis manifested itself as a kind of mania in me. Not only did I have to get all my chores done, but I needed to get good grades too. After a while, good wasn't good enough either. What if Dad decided that C's and B's weren't good enough? I strove for all A's, and Dad seemed happy with my efforts.\n\nTo the other kids, however, I was a weirdo, and I didn't really have any friends.\n\nDad was my only friend, but it was a strange kind of friendship.\n\nLike living with someone who has schizophrenia and could change at the slightest inclination.\n\nI didn't have any real friends until high school when I met Cass.\n\nCassandra Biggly was not what you would consider a model student. Her parents had high expectations for her, but she was a middling at best. She came to me because I was the smartest kid in school, at least according to the other kids, and she begged me to help her. I helped her, tutored her, showed her the way, and soon her grades improved. That was how we became friends, and how she was the first to find out about the Bean Jar.\n\n\"So, he just takes a bean out and crushes it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, not sounding at all mystified about the process.\n\n\"And...what? It means you have less beans?\"\n\nI thought about it, Dad had never actually told me what would happen, only that it would be terrible.\n\n\"When he takes out all the beans, then something awful will happen.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Cass asked, \"No dessert for a month?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I know that when he crushes those beans, it's like a piece of my sanity is mushed. I feel crazy after he smooshes a bean. I don't like feeling that way, I don't like it at all.\"\n\nI started crying. I hadn't meant to, I was sixteen and I never cried anymore, but Cass didn't make me feel bad about it. She just held me while I cried and eventually, I stopped. It had felt good to be held. Dad hugged me, but he never really comforted me. I didn't have a mom, someone whose job seemed to be comforting me, and as Cass held me, I realized what I had been missing all these years.\n\nI had been missing a Mom that I had never even known.\n\nWe hung out a lot after that, Cass and I. Despite our age, it never became inappropriate. She gave me something I had been missing, a friend without the threat of punishment looming over our relationship. The realization made me feel differently about my Dad. He was still the lovable goofball that he had always been, but I started to see how our entire relationship hung under the shadow of that bean jar. As I pulled away, he became more sullen, and more suspicious, and I saw him holding the Bean Jar sometimes as if he wished to smash them. If I wasn't misbehaving, though, he couldn't, that was always the deal. He knew it, I knew it, and he knew that as long as I abided by the rules, he couldn't punish me. \n\nDespite how it will sound, Dad was never cruel about the Bean Jar. He never used it to take out his frustrations, he never came home and punished me simply because he’d had a bad day. The rules were established, we had both agreed to them, and I knew that by following them I would be safe. I think, deep down, Dad really did think he was doing the best for me, thought he was molding me into something better than I could be, and I guess he was right, though it wasn’t fair, not really. \n\nThen, one day after coming home from Cass's, it all came to a head.\n\nDad was supposed to be at work, so Cass and I came back to the house to play video games. She had never even seen a Super Nintendo, and she wanted to play some Mario Kart with me. We had come in, laughing and making jokes, when someone cleared their throat loudly, sending a chill up my spine and turning me slowly to find my Dad sitting on the couch. He looked so much like he had the day he introduced the Bean Jar, and he was wearing that look of pain and resolve.\n\n\"You come home late, your chores aren't done, your homework is undone, and you have brought someone here without permission. Why have you decided to break the rules like this?\"\n\nI saw the hammer come down on the table, but I hadn't realized what he'd done until then. It turned the bean he had laid there to smithereens, and I shuddered as I gripped my head and moaned. If he noticed, he made no comment. He just brought the hammer down on another one, and I nearly vomited as a pain like no other went through me. He had lined up four, one for each infraction, but he had never done anything like this. It had always been one at a time, and that had been bad enough. \n\nThis, however, was unbearable.\n\n\"Stop it!\" Cass yelled, \"Whatever you're doing to him, stop,\" but he cut her off. \n\nHe grabbed her under the arm and heaved her toward the door, \"This is your fault. You've changed him, made him forget his purpose, but I won't let you kill him. You aren't allowed in this house, never again, and I,\"\n\n\"Put her down,\" I growled, finding my feet, weaving only a little, \"You will not touch her.\"\n\nMy father looked at me, not believing what he was hearing.\n\n\"Put her down, now,\" I repeated, stepping up close and getting in his face.\n\n\"You dare? You dare to challenge me? You're no different than the rest. I tried to raise you better, but it appears I was a fool. I'll smash every damn bean in that jar if I have to. When all the beans are gone, you’ll cease to exist! I’ll smash every damn bean in that jar, just to prove...just to...just to...prove,\" but he never finished. \n\nHe let go of the hammer as he clutched at his chest, and it fell from his grip as he gasped and beat at his shirt front. His face had gone from red to purple and before he hit the floor it was nearly black. I just stood there for a moment, listening to Cass beat at the door and ask what was wrong. I couldn’t answer, I just stood there, feeling like I was suffocating as the realization that my father was dead fell across me. \n\nThat was two years ago. \n\nI’ve been living with Cass since then, her parents taking me in gladly. Cass and I are getting ready for college and that’s when I remembered the house. It’s still there, still sitting on the same lot, and I decided that it might be good to sell it so I can pay tuition. There were things inside as well, I’ve been back there a few times to get things, and I knew my father’s room was essentially untouched. The police hadn’t bothered to search the place. Dad’s death was no mystery, after all, and they had decided he had died of a heart attack and saved me a lengthy interrogation. \n\nI started cleaning it out as summer began, selling what I could and donating what I couldn’t. I found pictures of my Dad and I, taken in better times, and far too soon I had cleaned out everything and was left with only my fathers room. I paused at the door, almost feeling like a burgler when I thought of going in there, but finally decided this was my house now and this room was as good as mine.\n\nThe room was spartan, a bed and a dresser and a closet, but it was what I found inside it that took me by surprise. \n\nFive jars, each of them bearing a different name.\n\nJacob, Mark, Sylvester, Katey, and James.\n\nThey were empty, the lids gone, and the taped on names made them look exactly like mine.\n\nWhat the hell was this? Who were these people? I didn’t know any of them, and no one but Dad and I had ever lived in the house. It had always been the two of us, always just…\n\nNo, that couldn’t be true, because my mother had once lived with us. \n\nThere, in the back, was a sixth jar, the glass broken but the tape intact.\n\nMaggie.\n\n“When the beans are gone,” I heard Dads voice echo in my head, “then you cease to exist.”\n\nHad the names on those jars been real people? Had I lived with them and simply didn’t remember them? How could you remember people who never existed? \n\nI sat there for a long time, trying to make sense of it all, and finally decided to write al this before it grew unclear.\n\nApparently Dad wasn’t as crazy as I might have thought, and maybe I should have been more respectful of the bean jar.\n\nIt sits on the shelf in my dorm room now.\n\nI took it from the house before I sold it and I guard it jealously. \n\nI don’t know if it still works the same now that dad is dead, but I’m not taking any chances. "

        "selftext": "Peek-A-Boo, I See You.\n\nMy eyes slowly opened; the soft and slightly sticky warmth of my modest 1-bedroom apartment hung like a an oppressive reminder that I, as an unemployed and nearly-penniless tenant, couldn’t afford to turn on my A\/C. \n\nI had fallen asleep in a slump against the old brown leather couch in the living room.  \n\nAgain. \n\nI groaned as my body shifted into place, stretching my legs and arms out feeling them wake up as I did.\n\nJuly in Georgia was NOT forgiving, and it certainly took no prisoners. \n\nThe hours I had whittled away I spent largely just laying around, hoping my email notification would go off regarding a potential job offer. This cycle had been ongoing for about a week..or two…and honestly, made time seem even more warped. \n\nMy mind berated me: Was I doing enough? Should I be burning through my very-nearly nonexistent savings like this? I shouldn’t be picky, I should just go get whatever job I can…beggars can’t be choosers y’know…\n\nAttempting to shake off the mental fog, I got up quickly from the couch, walked over the mini fridge against the adjacent wall and took out an ice-cold soda. Placing the cold can against my head I sighed, having momentary relief and trying to reassure myself that I was making the right decision. I deserve the RIGHT job. I have the experience. I have the skill set. I shouldn’t settle. One of these opportunities will pan out…I know it.\n\nFeeling a renewed sense of vigor, I turned to my phone, charging on the table that sat beside the couch. I nabbed it up and looked as the screen to see the time, 4:37pm, and nothing else but my screen saver - some generic mountain range captured at dusk that always made me feel nostalgic for a place I’d never been. \n\nI let out another sigh, glanced around my sparse and warm living quarters and thought about how to kill the rest of the day. \n\nThat’s when I heard it. Outside my apartment window. A lady’s voice, fairly young. Exuberant. Happy. But…slightly wrong. \n\nShe spoke, “I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” \n\nIt sounded like she was talking to kid, maybe an even a baby. I was half tempted to pull back the curtain and scan the lawn to see, but I thought, if she was there and some weird dude starts staring at her…well, that’d be awkward. \n\nI’m not overly familiar with my neighbors in the apartments across the way. But I’d never seen a kid or baby, and I’d never heard a voice like this before. \n\nTo a normal person, you’d think “why is a lady talking to a baby weird?” - and you know, I’d agree with you. But, I’d spent too much time indoors with naught but my own mind to keep me company. And I’m sure you can guess that leads to heightened anxiety.\n\n“Christopher, get a-fuckin-hold of yourself dude” - “you’ve spent too many days sitting in this apartment moping around that now some lady talking to a baby has you freaked out” - \n\nI let out a chuckle at myself for being so stupid. \n\nWhat a dumbass…\n\nI cracked the soda open and took big gulp, letting the carbonation and sugar simultaneously burn and soothe my throat. \n\nI let a hearty and likely-annoying “AHHHHH” afterwards, and to my own amusement.\n\nI finished the soda in another two gulps, walked over the trash can situated near the sink and chucked it in. \n\nWalking back into the living room, I noticed there was no longer any game of peek-a-boo being cooed outside my window and all had returned to its normal and uninteresting silence. \n\nWith this, I turned my attention back to the phone, deciding I would manually check my emails. Sometimes notifications don’t always works as intended and I was desperate for some sign of forward momentum.\n\nAs I placed my finger over the “email” icon on my home screen the exuberant, joyful and even more warped voice rang out again.\n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” \n\nThis time it wasn’t coming from behind me, beyond the curtained window. It was coming from my porch; right behind my front door.\n\nI stared in confusion in its direction. \n\n“What in fuck” - I could feel anxiety anxious energy surge through my body. My mind wasn’t sure how to process the voice or what was happening -\n\nWhy is the voice at my door? Why does it sound like that? \n\nI tried to quickly rationalize it; uh…maybe she’s waiting for her friend across the way, the uh…Carrollwoods I think? Maybe she’s friends or family, and it’s hot and she’s got her baby and is trying to keep him calm or entertained? \n\nMy brain was rooting around trying to red-yarn its way to some conclusion that made that voice - that was now just passed my front door - less out of place; less…strange.\n\n“Get your act together..” \n\nThen it hit me. \n\nI’m dramatizing a situation because I’m bored and not being productive. \n\nOf course.\n\nDuh.\n\nI chuckled again at my own stupidity.\n\nI’m going to go to my room and watch TV. \nThe fan blows better in there anyways; and I’ll be away from this lady’s annoying blabbering. I’m not scared, I’m just annoyed. \n\nI lied to make myself feel less like a wuss who was evading a strange scenario, and more like someone who was choosing to avoid an obnoxious situation.\n\nI sat up and quickly walked down the hall. The lady’s discordant, joyful and robotic “I see you!” fading.\n\nUpon entering my modest room - which housed a bed, a sofa chair, a small closest and smaller bathroom, I shut the door and, out some animal-borne sense of security - locked it.\n\nI plopped down in the sofa chair and quickly booted up my TV and launched Netflix. \n\nI was paranoid about nothing. I knew that. But, stranger things have happened, and I wasn’t going to assume I was safe. \n\nDespite not being able to hear the lady any longer, I cranked the volume over my usual listening threshold. I sat back and began to watch a documentary on Panda preservation.\n\nBefore I knew it my eyes had grown heavy and my body and mind had given themselves over to sleep yet again. \n\nSome time later I jolted awake. the room dark and TV off due to its power-save settings. \n\nWhat had woken me was the soft pulsating of the phone in my hand vibrating.\n\nThe caller-ID read “Mom”.\n\nI stared at it - half out of grogginess and half out of cowardice. “Do I want to talk to her?” or, as it usually goes with my mother, “be talked at” by her.\n\nI decided against answering. I was already feeling annoyed at myself enough, I didn’t need a good ol’ dogpiling from my mother to top it off.\n\nPlus, I had to pee. God did I have to pee.\n\nI got up, and hustled the few short steps into the connected bathroom. Flicked on the light, and as I was about unbuckle my pants, from past the door to my bedroom came THAT voice. The lady’s voice. Joyful, sweet, energetic. LOUD. And very very WRONG. \n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!”\n\nThere was no denying it now. This voice sounded human, but it wasn’t. It was slightly warped. As if the edges of it were bending, warping. As if the mouth forming them was too misshapen to form them right; as if the voice projecting them was doing its best to mock it. \n\nMy mind raced; this seemed unbelievable. What in absolute fuck was less than 3 feet away, inside my apartment, WHY was it doing this to me?\n\nI blinked hard and gathered what little resolve I had - it didn’t matter what or why this was happening. It just was. And I could safely conclude that, whatever it was, it was intending to scare or - worse - hurt me.\n\nI had my phone. I could call 9-1-1. That was step one. \n\nStep two, I had a baseball bat in my closet. I could grab that and ready myself. \n\nStep three, I had small window that dropped down into the courtyard. I was on the second floor, but I could manage the jump. I think.\n\nThat’s all I could think to do.\n\nWith all the bluster and bravado I could muster, I quickly moved to the sofa chair, grabbed my phone and made to my open closest grabbing the bat, all in a few swift movements. All the while the “Lady” was cooing the same phrase over and over again, on a loop, not more than 5 feet away.\n\nI wrestled with the lock on my bedroom window. It wasn’t playing nice. I don’t think I’d ever opened it in the 4 years I’d lived here and it obviously hadn’t been opened long before then. \n\nAfter struggling with the latch for what felt like an eternity, it gave way and I then proceeded to press up on the window. Luckily it went flying up without much resistance, and as I pushed it up it made a hard slamming sound.\n\nAnd as if on cue, when that happened, the “Lady” outside the door chanting stopped on a dime.\n\nIt was dead silent. The only discernible sound was my breathing, the night air flowing in and bringing with it the sounds crickets and cicadas.\n\nI sat by the open window, wide-eyed. Staring directly into the dinky lit room and laser-focused on the bedroom door.\n\nFrom underneath the door frame an impossibly long arm silently began to stretch up. Skin pale, almost blue in the light. Vascular. The fingers, long, boney and dressed in rings against their bulging knuckles. The fingernails longer still and adorned in a crimson polish that almost seemed to glow in the drearily lit bedroom.\n\nThe impossibly long arm effortlessly stretched until its index finger effortlessly touched the lock on the doorknob. And as if waiting just a beat to heighten the tension, it clicked the lock.\n\nThe door was now unlocked. This…”Lady” could swing the door open…and whatever it was could cross the threshold into the room and come for me.\n\nI had to jump. The risk of breaking my legs be damned, I didn’t want to see what ghoulish visage that arm belonged too. \n\nI steeled my nerves and jumped the twelve or so feet to grass courtyard below. \n\nI landed with a hard thud, but not didn’t lose my balance.\n\nMy adrenaline rushing, I made a hasty dash toward the center of my small complex. My legs firing like pistons, I gunned it to nearest light source, which happened to be a small gazebo. \n\nThen my flight or fight response loosened enough for me to think: “I gotta call the fuckin’ cops!”\n\nAs I approached the small structure, which was bathed in a harsh and singular white light, I pivoted to look back at my apartment window. No hand. No creature. No…nothing. Just an open window.\n\nBut what would I expect to see? Some ghoulish haunt leering out at me from that darkened opening? Some unholy visage, all teeth and elongated appendages coaxing me back in? What was going on with me? Was I having some sort…breakdown? Had the stress and loneliness gotten to me? That was certainly a better explanation than what I was THINKING was happening…right?\n\nI sighed, plopped down hard on the only bench housed under the gazebo and unlocked my phone.\n\nI had a notification.\n\nAn email.\n\nI knew, no matter, now wasn’t the time. I needed to call the cops. I needed to make sure my apartment was clear and if I was having a mental breakdown, I could get help. I needed this…whatever the fuck it was…to be over. \n\nBut, you know that often unseen hand the guides us to make the most inane decisions at just the wrong moment? Yeah. That ONE. That force propelled me to click on the email notification.\n\nGod dammit, I wish I hadn’t.\n\nIt took me to a video. \n\nThe video was dark, quiet. As if nothing was even playing…but then a loud static and the sound of hands fumbling around as the frame was jilted and shook.\n\nAnd then, as if lit with a small and barely effectual flashlight, a mouth plastered with a wry grin appeared. But, as with the voice, it was wrong. It was too wide, with far too many small teeth. the lips were thin and smeared with crimson lipstick, the same shade as fingernails I’d seen just minutes ago.\n\nThen it began to move; to talk. \n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you!”\n\nI felt my body flush with fear; confusion; anger. WHAT. THE. FUCK. WAS. HAPPENING?!\n\nI tried to exit out, I tried shutting my phones power off. Nothing was working.\n\nI instinctively, and forcefully, dropped my phone. the mantra was on a disturbing repeat. The “Lady’s” joyous and warped voice a disgusting lullaby I HAD to get away from.\n\nWhatever ungodly force had decided to visit me was breaking the bounds of any reality I understood. \n\n“Neighbors!” - my mind yelled at me. “ GO to the Carrolwood’s…ask to use their phone…call 9-1-1. Figure this shit out. GO!” \n\nI spurred myself into action, running out from beneath the gazebo and toward the other two story apartment complex that directly faced mine.\n\nNavigating the dimly lit walkway up to their door, I didn’t have concern for etiquette or what time it was; I was in pure self-preservation mode.\n\nI knocked on their door as loudly I could.\n\n“Fuck…what’s the wife’s name? Denise? Desiree? Ahhh. Something with a D…” \n\nI simultaneously scolded myself whilst trying to recall the woman’s name. Her husband, who I had only met once in passing, was a complete unknown.\n\nBefore I could deliberate any further, a porch light popped on and a voice from behind the door wavered out at me.\n\nIt was a man - the aforementioned husband.\n\n“Who…what the hell do you want?”\n\n“I am so sorry to bother you Mr. Carrollwood…But someone broke into my house and I don’t have my cell and I’m worried and I need to call the cops.. I live across the way in unit 17 -“\n\nHe cut me off.\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Christian, right?” He said, his tone less unsure and worried and now more curious and annoyed.\n\n“Christopher.” I responded back hurriedly while throwing another glance at my apartment unit.\n\nAnother voice, quieter, came out from behind the door. A woman. \n\n“Christopher, honey, yes? You sound scared. Let’s get you some help”\n\nThank god. Buddha. Shiva. Elvis. Who-the-fuck-ever!\n\nI sighed. I felt a wave of uncertain hope wash over me. \n\nThe door unlatched and swung open to reveal a dark opening. \n\nOne that seemed stretch in a void….\n\nThere was no one there. \n\nNo Mr. Carrollwood.\n\nNo Ms. Carrollwood.\n\nJust a dark hallway and a voice that loudly reached from just beyond its bounds.\n\n“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you…CHRISTOPHER”\n\nAs quickly as I had felt hope, I felt my body give itself over to absolute terror.\n\nI spun around and attempted to run, but that long, pale-blue arm. The one with its nail’s adorned in a bright, glowing crimson polish had wrapped its unnatural fingers all the way around my calf.\n\nI fell hard on the “We’re Glad You’re Here!” Welcome mat that decorated the front porch of the Carrollwood’s.\n\nI managed to turn my body around to see that the arm was pulling me into the void. I couldn’t see the creature it was attached too, and I didn’t want too. I need to fight. I get loose.\n\nBut I was being dragged by a force so strong, any attempt I made to swing my bat or kick was met with pure indifference.\n\n“Holy shit! This is it” my mind raced. My heart thrashed inside my chest so hard, I felt like I’d have a heart attack, or worse, die of fear.\n\nI swung the bat. I yelled. I cursed.\n\nIt was no use. I was being drawn into the maw of this entity, this being. This…THING.  \n\nI had shut my eyes and waited. Waited to die. \n\nI stopped moving. \n\nI didn’t feel the hand upon my leg anymore. \n\nI felt warm. \n\nI jolted awake. \n\nI was in my apartment. The sticky-heaviness of the room just as it had been hours before.\n\nThe golden light from the afternoon poured in through what cracks it could.\n\n“What the fuck” I thought. “Did…I just dream that shit?”\n\nAs I straightened my stiff and slightly achey body up - and coming to grips with absolute deja vu - a voice rang out from down the hall. This time, slow; loud; and just passed the threshold of my sight.\n\n“PEEK-A-BOO….I. SEE. YOU.”\n"

        "selftext": "The wind blew gently through the wheat field, causing a golden wave to ripple across the tufts at the end of the endless sea of stalks. Bart closed his eyes and relished the feeling of the breeze on his brow. He inhaled deeply. Today was a great day to be alive.\n\nHe exhaled sharply as the smell of smoke flicked across his nostrils. He opened his eyes and turned around. The wind had shifted, and was blowing the smoke against his back as he walked away from the burning barn.\n\nIt would probably be a day before anyone was out this far, and he'd be long gone as long as he made it to the tracks by dark. And if he saw a motorist or wagon, he could just flag them down shoot them too. Then he may not even have to jump a train. It was easy going.\n\nSo easy, he took the time to sit down and untie the drawstring on his bag. A fat stack of bills, some jewelry, and a few tins of potatoes.\nMost folks didn't trust banks after the crash, and kept stockpiles of cash in their homes somewhere. He was disappointed they didn't have more food, but he knew the man of the house would give up the money if he was persuasive enough. And Bart was always persuasive enough, eventually.\n\nHe opened one of the tins with his knife, eating a few potatoes. He scanned around. He was on a gravel wagon trail, what amounted to a main road around these parts. On either side of him were the golden wheat fields, with woods beyond that on one side, and rolling green hills as far as the horizon on the other side. The only scar on the  absolutely breaktaking natural scenery was that burning barn. By now it was probably smoldering. Someone may see the smoke but Bart was confident he had made it far enough away.\n\nHe finished the tin of potatoes, sheathed his knife, and cinched the bag shut. He tied the drawstring off into a knot, and scanned around one more time just out of habit. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, as he spotted a man walking the trail, a long way off. He reached in his pocket, gripping the broom handled pistol.\n\nThe man walking towards him was still quite a ways off, but Bart could tell he wore an old fashioned duster jacket and a brimmed hat. He was in the shadow of a tree, so it was hard for Bart to see any details beyond his silhouette. \n\nBart grinned, taking out a cigarette and digging for a match. He'd let the old timer catch up, then take him for whatever he had on him. Usually he would force the man at gunpoint to take him to his home, then give him whatever cash or jewelry he had, then one to the head, no witnesses. But he'd already executed that exact scenario to perfection once today, no point getting greedy. The man's wallet would do, as long as there were no witnesses. Never any witnesses.\n\nBart glanced back up, and this time he jumped a little bit. The man was much closer, still a distance away, but he shouldn't have been able to cover that distance in the time it took Bart to light his cigarette. Maybe he wasn't an old man after all, just wearing his granddad's old jacket, maybe. Bart still couldn't see any details on the man's face, who was now shrouded in the shadow of a cloud blocking the sun. Bart realized it had become very overcast, with thick, light grey clouds rolling in with no warning.\n\nBart wasn't a religious man, or a superstitious one, so he took another drag on his cigarette, nervously tapping the handle of the pistol in his pocket. He looked at the man again, almost expecting him to be unnaturally close, but the man just walked towards Bart steadily. The breeze blew towards them, blowing at the stranger's back. Bart stood up quickly, blinking his eyes. Wisps of black smoke distorted his vision, and he waved his hand.\n\nNo way the barn was still burning by now, unless he started a brushfire. Bart shook his head. That doesn't make sense, he would've seen it approaching. Before he could linger on it, the smoke cleared as the breeze picked up, whipping Bart's long, dirty hair in his face.\n\nHe saw the stranger, still walking towards him, the wind blowing at his back, and realized the man had a huge black German shepherd walking calmly at his side. The man was still shrouded in a shadow that seemed far too dark, even with what felt like a coming storm pouring in. Bart saw a glint in the stranger's eyes. Maybe it was light reflecting off a pair of spectacles? But what light? Ir was overcast... \n\nBart threw down his cigarette, stamping it out and shaking his head. Arguing with himself wasn't gonna get him out of this storm. He got up and started walking, away from the stranger. The wind blew at his back, the cold air making his hair stand on end. Having his back to the stranger felt wrong, even with the distance still between them.\n\nBart couldn't explain why he suddenly changed his mind about robbing the man. He could've just shot the dog, it's not like he hadn't dealt with dogs before. His hair whipped around his head, the cold wind blowing on the back of his neck. He glanced over his shoulder.\n\nThe stranger was standing still, on top of the crest of the previous rolling hill. Bart still couldn't see any details, but he was relieved to see the man was no longer following him. He sighed, and let his eyes follow the path down the hill. And from around the bend, not growling, not barking or snarling, bounded the dog.\n\nBart yelled, drawing his pistol. There was a click as it misfired, and the dog pounced, clamping its jaws around his forearm. They fell to the ground, the dog breathing heavily but never snarling or growling. Bart screamed in agony and terror, and the dog grunted with effort, ripping at his arm. He could feel the muscles tearing, and fumbled for his knife. He yanked the knife out of the sheath, and planted it in the dog's neck. The dog let go of his arm, and finally growled.\n\n\nThe constable was riding fast down the path. A young boy had seen smoke, and ran to get him as quick as he could. By this point the constable didn't see much smoke, but he knew there was only one family out here where it could've been coming from.\n\n\"Whoa!\" The constable called out, pulling on the reigns and stopping his horse. He quickly jumped off, approaching the figure before him.\n\nBart was lying on the ground, surrounded by red stained gravel. Both of his legs, and both of his arms had been savagely bitten and pulled apart by some animal. Bart was still alive, pleading for help, and the constable was shaking as he realized he could see down to the bone on all four of the man's limbs. Any connecting muscle tissue on his forearms or lower legs was gnawed away. \n\nThe constable looked around, and saw the bag of money and jewelry untied and spilling out onto the bloody path. Next to the bag was the broom handled pistol, and a set of bloody pawprints moving away up the path.\n\nThe constable felt a cold breeze hit him, and looked to the top of the nearby hill. He saw a figure in a brimmed hat and a duster jacket, with a dog at his side, walking away into the open territory, the wind blowing at his back."

        "selftext": "I’ve been sitting on this one for a little while, but I think it’s time.\n\nThis happened about three years ago. I was, without a doubt, the worst kind of hiker. You know those guys who are all “leave no sign”, bagging their garbage, burying their poop, cleaning up their campsite, respecting nature's natural beauty, and all that? Ya, that wasn’t me. I like camping, my parents like camping, but there was always a mentality of “the woods will take care of things.” I watched my dad leave a whole cooler full of empty beer cans at the site one time when I was eight. We brought a couch with us on a camping trip once just cause Dad knew there was a ravine nearby. Broken fishing rods? Left by the creek. Garbage? Right on the ground. Hell, we left a whole tent once cause Dad couldn’t get it back in the bag. We didn’t use campgrounds either. Dad and Mom would pack up and find somewhere in the middle of nowhere and just live off the land for a couple of days, and then leave their crap behind.\n\nI can’t say that this is why I am the way I am. I know better than to litter and be a pig, but, in my head, the woods will always just take care of themselves. It’s been here for millions of years, why is my trash and stuff gonna mess with that? If my styrofoam cooler kills a couple of trees then they didn’t deserve to be there, right?\n\nThat was what I thought, at least.\n\nI go camping about three times a year; the start of spring, the start of summer, and the end of summer. I live in California, so I always just pack up my pickup, get some food and beer and “recreational greenery”, and head out to somewhere remote. A buddy of mine from work hadn’t shut up about this overlook about an hour from the city, right outside the Santa Lucia Mountain range, and I figured I’d go crash out there for a weekend. Unlike my parents, I am not a “living off the land” kind of person. I brought food, I brought stuff, and I intended to do nothing but sit in the wilderness, sleep in my hammock, and get high.\n\nI called out Friday and found the perfect spot by lunchtime. It was gorgeous, overlooking the valley and so remote that if I were to get really hurt I’d prolly die out here with no one the wiser. I set up my hammock, set out my fire logs, got some water (just in case) and just kinda spread out a bit. I made some lunch, sandwiches, rolled a joint, and just kinda got mellow for a bit as the day rolled on. It was nice out here, just watching the clouds and listening to nature. I was soon pretty well-lit and as the sun started creeping down I set about lighting my fire. There was probably a burn ban in effect but I had water and I didn’t care. Out here, no one was going to see me anyway, and I started roasting hotdogs as the sun cut a fantastic line across the sky.\n\nThat was the first time I noticed them.\n\nI remember looking up and whispering shit as I mistook them for Rangers or Cops or something. They were just silhouettes on the ridge not far from my camp, three or four of them, and they had these wide, flat-topped hats like park rangers or the guy on the oatmeal box. I watched them for a minute, thinking I was busted, but they just stood there. They didn’t move, they didn’t call out, but I know they saw me. My fire had to be visible for a ways at this height, and the longer they stayed there, the more creeped out I felt. Why were they just standing there? If they wanted me to leave, then why not tell me to leave?\n\nI didn’t know, but once the sun set, I noticed they had vanished and just kinda kept an eye peeled. I had my gun, a big ole .45, so I wasn’t worried, but I suddenly wished I had a tent to sleep in instead of just a hammock. I sparked up again after eating a pack of dogs, though, and that took care of any thoughts of shadow guys or whatever. \n\nI dozed off in my hammock but I dreamed about them that night too. \n\nI dreamed that they were in my campsite, just standing around and watching me. They were like the outlines of people, like when someone stands in front of the sun and all you get is a burnt-out image of them. They didn’t have any features, no eyes or anything, and I was frozen there as they looked at me. They didn’t say anything, they just watched me, and it felt like being sleep-paralyzed the whole night.\n\nI woke up after dawn, almost fell out of my hammock, and started making breakfast as I stirred up the ashes of last night's fire. I wondered if it had really been a dream or not, but I felt like it must have been. Why would they come and look but not say anything? All my stuff was there, too, down to the hot dog wrapper I'd left on the ground next to the fire, and I tossed it in absentmindedly as I ate my eggs and ham. The ice was still holding out, it was spring and not too hot yet, so I decided to go on a forest pub crawl today.\n\nTranslation: I put a bunch of beer into my backpack and walked out into the woods so I could have a drunk hike.\n\nI spent about five hours hiking in the woods, tossing my dead soldiers into the trees as I finished them. Some of them broke, most of them didn’t, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was following me as I hiked in the woods. I never saw anything, it wasn’t like I spotted someone hiding behind a tree, but it was, like, deep pockets of shadow that shouldn’t have been there. It was midday, the sun was high, and I should have had major visibility. Even so, I found myself looking around as the crawling feeling just got worse and worse. Some of it was being drunk in the hot woods with no water, and when I found a stream I plunged my face in to get a little clarity. I drank a little, Dad always said running water was fine to drink from, and when something snapped not far from me, I looked up like a zebra at a watering hole.\n\nI looked around, trying to find what was stalking me.\n\nThere was nothing, just the quiet forest, and the gently rushing stream. \n\nNo, no, I didn't believe that. I had felt stalked all day, and as I watched the trees I felt sure that something moved out there. I got up and started running, the zebra analogy too hard to break, and I kept waiting for the claws to sink in, the teeth to bite, and the hot breath to fall on my neck. It was going to come at any minute, I could feel it, and when I tripped over a fallen log I just lay there and waited for the end. It would get me now. It would get me and I'd be dead, I'd be dead, I'd be...\n\nNothing happened.\n\nI lay there for nearly ten minutes, just knowing it would get me when I moved, but it never came.\n\nWhen the ants started to bite my legs I sat up and swiped at them. I had fallen next to an ant bed that I had accidentally stomped on in my haste and they were mad as hell about it. I ended up going back to the creek to wash them off, a haphazard trip that took another ten minutes, and I was still looking around like a scared animal. I sat with my legs in the creek until they stopped throbbing and then made my miserable way back to camp. It was not as much fun walking back as it had been walking out, and I was jittery and tense the whole way. The sun was starting to slip down and I absolutely didn't want to be out here when it got dark. \n\nToo many things could be crunching around out here in the dark.\n\nI made it back to camp before it got dark, and as I cooked my dinner the sun started to ride low again. It was more hotdogs tonight, cooked over the fire, but I couldn't finish all of them. I was too scared to look away from the ridge and I ended up burning more than one of them. They tasted fine either way, but I had eyes only for the shadows on the ridge.\n\nThey had the same wide-brimmed hats, a few of them had canes, but none of them were really people. They were like shadows, the burned images at Hiroshima, the photo negatives that sometimes get burned into old photographs, all of them at once, and none of them at all. They just stood there, watching me. They didn't move, they didn't stir, and as the sun sank I became colder and colder. I should have gone to my truck and left, but I didn't. I made myself put it out of my mind, I convinced myself that I was being foolish. \n\nWhen it got dark I got in my hammock and tried to get comfortable, but it wouldn't come. My leg hurt, I was sunburnt, I was hungover, I was dehydrated, I was, I was, I was, I was, but ultimately I was afraid. I was afraid that when I closed my eyes they would get me. I was afraid they would just carry me off in the night and I would never be seen again. They would find my truck and my campsite, but never me.\n\nMaybe, I thought as I finally nodded off, someone would look up one afternoon at sunset and see me on that ridge, just watching.\n\nI must have fallen asleep, and I like to think I dreamed what came next.\n\nI want to, but I can't convince myself that I did.\n\nI \"woke up\" and saw them standing around me. I could see them, and not just the ones in front of the fire. They were darker than the night somehow, and they began to creep closer to me. Crept is the wrong word, though. They slid along the ground like the ghosts in some of the horror movies I'd watched as a kid. They hemmed me in, my body shaking but my voice stuck in my throat. I didn't dare move, I didn't dare speak, and as they knelt around me, I heard whispering. It was a terrible sound, and it follows me into sleep sometimes.\n\n\"You come here to the womb of creation and leave your waste.\"\n\n\"You are a brainless creature fit only to destroy things made by your betters.\"\n\n\"You burn the wood of a creature who has existed before you were more than a twinkling in your father's eye, you destroy a place that was new when this planet cooled, you throw your trash into a home shared by a hundred billion organisms, and you claim to be the superior here, the better. You are nothing, and you will die and be forgotten.\"\n\nOn and on and on. They whispered endlessly to me, telling me how worthless I was, how I was a nuisance and a nothing, and how I would never change. Then, one of them rose up over my hammock, his body seeming to hang over me like a shadow cast from above. He looked like them, but he was clearly their boss or something, and when he brought the cane down on nothing but air, I heard it crack like a thunderbolt.\n\n\"Go back to your stinking pit, but be warned. The next time you come to our woods and ruin our place, you will not be allowed to scamper off so easily. You are a stunted thing who was taught badly, but ignorance is forgivable. If you persist in this folly, however, we will not be so kind again. Now GO!\" it yelled, and I opened my eyes to find that it was morning.\n\nI was laying in my hammock, piss dribbling down my leg, and I knew that I better not be here when the sun set again.  \n\nI cleaned up everything. I picked up all my garbage, I cleaned up the site, I poured water over the fire, and mixed it with dirt like they always say to on TV, and then I took everything with me and ran for the truck. \n\nThat was Sunday, and I've been kind of afraid to leave my apartment. What if they are waiting out there for me? What if they find me slipping or don't like that I don't recycle or something like that? What if I offend them and they drag me back to the woods to be punished?\n\nThat's part of why I'm writing this. If you're like me, someone who doesn't care about their mess or just leaves the woods wrecked, then watch out. Don't let the Dark Watchers catch you messing up their forest because they do more than just watch. Don't let them see you slipping, or you might find out what sort of punishment awaits those who anger them. "

        "selftext": "“Attention, teachers and students, recess is canceled today due to crows, that is all.”\n\nThere was a collective awww from the students but that wasn't what had gotten my attention.\n\nHad the principal just said Crows? Like the birds, I asked myself as I told my third graders we would play Heads Up Seven Up. As they got set up to play the game, I picked up the phone and called a friend of mine in the other class. Kayla had been helping me integrate into the flow of Jefferson Moore Elementary since I'd arrived here at the start of the year, and I could hear the smile on her face as she answered the phone.\n\n“Mrs. Swearington's Class,”\n\n“Crows?” I asked without preamble, “Did I hear that right?”\n\n“You did. The school has a code for Crows and you should definitely follow it.”\n\nI was quiet for a moment, trying to find a good response to that, until she said my name like she might have lost me.\n\n“I mean, are crows different in Ohio? Cause we had crows in Maine too and we didn't close down the playground for them.”\n\nShe was quiet for a moment and I could hear the sound of a very heated argument going on over what I assumed was a game of heads up seven up. Great minds thought alike, it seemed.\n\n“Crows here are a little different. I can't really talk about it right now. Meet me after school for drinks and I'll fill you in. Don't worry, though. Crow days only usually last a couple of days.”\n\n“A couple of days?” I said in disbelief, but that was when someone started crying and Kayla said she had to go.\n\nShe hung up and I was left with more questions than answers.\n\nIt wasn't that much of an inconvenience, I supposed. My kids, despite being eight and nine, were pretty well-behaved. I had very few fights, very little beyond the usual drama that surrounded little kids, and most of them were good friends who helped each other. My own game of heads up seven up was full of more laughing than arguments, and as recess ended, we started Math and worked toward lunch. Good kids or not, it was still going to be a long day without recess. Even the best-behaved kids get stir-crazy when they can't blow off steam on the playground. Luckily, we had Gym today so they could get their zoomies out in the fully enclosed gym building instead. We walked across the school, me leading the line as we headed for the gymnasium, and I couldn't help but glance at the playground as we walked past.\n\nEven as an adult, I thought the new playground looked pretty cool. They had replaced all the old metal equipment with colorful plastic and it made me wish I could take my tie and my sensible shoes off and just go play with them for a while. There were five large, colorful structures, teeter totters, slides a plenty, a four-square court, some of those spring animals, a big sandbox, a basketball court, and lots of shady places to sit and visit with friends. It was an amazingly inviting place, but today it looked like something out of a Stephen King novel. \n\nThe crows had taken over every inch of the playground, and they lay thick upon the land. They watched us as we passed, looking affronted to see people so close. I understood now, it was a little intimidating to see that many crows assembled. They called a group of crows a murder, and the name made sense now. They looked capable of anything as they sat there glaring at us. They looked capable of hurting even me in such numbers, and I turned my back on them with a real effort.\n\nThey were still there when the bell rang to release students for the day, and I noticed that no one went anywhere near the playground as they headed for home or the bus.\n\nKayla shot me a text as I was walking to my car to let me know that she'd had to go home with stomach problems, but that she would meet with me soon to let me know the story behind the crows.\n\n“Just don't do anything dumb in the meantime. I don't want you to get in over your head ;).”\n\nI rolled my eyes at her text but decided I would toe the line until I had more information. I had to admit that something about that group of crows had spooked me, and I suddenly didn't like the idea of just going out there and scaring them off. I didn't know how they would react, and I wasn't in a big hurry to find out. I had joked that we had crows where I was from, but I didn't think I had ever seen crows like this. \n\nI must have been thinking about them as I lay down to sleep because I dreamed about them that night.\n\nI was walking onto the playground, the crows sitting around me and staring in disapproval. Everything beyond the playground was in mist like I was standing in a fog bank, and the deeper I went into the playground, the more crows there seemed to be. In the center of the playground was a merry-go-round, the old metal ones that often injured the children who went to play on them. Standing in the center of it was a man, slowly rotating with the motion of the thing. He had his back to me, and I saw that he wore a coal-black coat with a high, dark mantle. His top hat was lined with feathers and shiny trinkets, and his boots were black and thick. He was rotating slowly, the old engine of destruction squealing as it turned ever so slowly. The crows were looking at him, their beady eyes drawn to him, and as he spun, I became afraid. I didn't think I wanted this man to look at me. I thought that if he looked at me something terrible might happen, but I was powerless to look away. He just spun like a ballerina in a music box, and as he came around, I saw one glittering eye before I woke up in a cold sweat.\n\nThere was another warning about the crows during the morning announcements, but it was hardly needed. We had all seen them as they perched on the playground equipment as we came to school that day. I was working the pickup line that morning, and the reactions of the children weren't what drew my attention. The children were disappointed but understanding. No, it was the reaction of the adults as they caught sight of the crows. There were some transplants, like me, who looked at it like an oddity, but it was the local parents that really caught my eye. They looked at the playground like a source of childhood trauma and many of them made sure to tell their children not to go to the playground under any circumstances.\n\n“Keep a close eye on her,” one mother said to me as her kindergartner walked inside, her pink coat making her stand out amongst the sea of children, “I had hoped they wouldn't come back this year. Damn him,” she whispered and then looked at me like she had said too much before driving off in a controlled hurry.\n\nWe settled in for today's lessons, but you could tell that the mood was muted. They didn't have gym to look forward to today, the extracurricular was Music, and they knew that there would be no real outside activity today. I hated it for them, and when I called Kayla at about ten thirty, my texts going unseen, I was in for another surprise. The woman who answered said that Ms. Swearington was out today, and might be out for the rest of the week.\n\n“Poor dear. She caught that bug that's going around. I hope she didn't leave it behind when she was here yesterday, I hear it's nasty.”\n\nI didn't even have lunch with my friend to look forward to, it seemed, and I settled in for a long day.\n\nAs the class played hide and seek during indoor recess, I noticed that one of my students was still at her desk. Lisa was coloring up a storm, really putting swirls on her paper, and I came up to check what she was drawing. She looked absolutely focused on what she was doing, showing no interest in the other students or their games. It was odd to see that kind of focus in a kid her age, and she jumped a little when I came up behind her and tapped her shoulder.\n\n“Whatcha,” I started, but when I looked at the page it took my breath away.\n\nShe had drawn the playground from my dream perfectly, complete with the man in the dark cloak and top hat. He was standing on the merry-go-round, arms extended to the sky, and the crows were flying all around him. The picture was way too detailed for someone her age, much too good for someone not even in middle school, and when she looked back at me, she asked if I had seen him.\n\n“Who?” I asked though I knew who she meant.\n\n“The Crow Count,” she said, matter-of-factly as if it was something that everyone knew.\n\n“I haven't,” I lied, picking up the picture and getting a better look, “Who is he?”\n\n“Mommy says not to talk about him,” Lisa said, looking guilty as if realizing she shouldn't have been drawing him either.\n\n“I won't tell,” I said as I put the page back on her desk, “is he a friend of yours?”\n\n“No,” Lisa said and she sounded afraid of the idea that someone might think he was friends with her, “The Crow Count isn't anyone's friend. He brings the crows here, at least that's what Mommy told me. She said I must never go into a big group of crows or the Crow Count will take me away with the murder.”\n\nHearing someone so young say these things made me cold all over again, but I just patted her arm and said that was very interesting. It was the most normal thing in the world to her, apparently, and I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that this was my first time hearing about it. I left her to her coloring, telling my students they had about five minutes left for indoor recess before going back to my desk. I Googled Crow Count and Crows in Ohio, but I didn't get much. Crows in Ohio brought up memes, because of course it did, but Crow Count brought up only a single entry. It was an old Germanic legend about a ruler of crows who sometimes took children to feed his flock or young girls to be his bride. Neither were ever seen again, but it was the excuse for telling children to avoid large groups of crows, something associated with battlefields and death. \n\nThe depiction, something taken from an old storybook, was very familiar.\n\nA courtly fellow in a tall hat with feathers and a dark cloak.\n\nI clicked off o fit, feeling my stomach tie itself in a knot, and began geography. \n\nI was still thinking about it at the end of the day as the bell rang and everyone headed for home. The playground was still full of crows, and it was hard not to imagine that I could see someone on the playground among them. Could that be the hatted gentleman, the Crow Count? I didn't dare look too long, but I was beginning to get a little tired of this. Two days with no outdoor recess was beginning to take a toll on my students. I didn't know what we'd do if this went on much longer, but it appeared we'd never find out.   \n\nAfter a night spent dreaming about crows and the man in the tall hat, I arrived at school to find a group of adults standing around the outskirts of the playground. The crows were giving them an unhappy look, looking like bouncers preparing to kick them out, and I approached the group to see what was going on. The teachers looked at me guiltily, not seeming to be sure what to say, until Mr. Simmonson, the fifth-grade English Teacher, stepped up and said one of his students had gone in there.\n\n“Samantha Parks was walking across the track, heading for her first class, when she stopped and looked at the playground. It was like something had entranced her, and she walked slowly away from the track and headed into the playground.”\n\n“Has anyone gone in after her?” I said, afraid the birds might hurt her.\n\nThe others shook their heads and I felt a rage bubble in me as I dropped my bag and walked toward the playground.\n\nCrows or no crows, I was going to let a student get injured without trying to help them.\n\nMr. Simmonson caught my arm as I tried to go in, “He won't like it if you disturb him.” he whispered, looking ashamed as he said it.\n\n“Who?” I asked, squaring my shoulders and looking at him darkly, “The Crow Count?”\n\nHe looked surprised that I knew the name, but when he let me go, I walked straight onto the playground and away from the pack of cowards.\n\nThe crows watched me, hostility in their beady eyes, but they made no move to attack me as I walked among them. It was exactly like my dream. The crows covered everything, their numbers having risen in the three days they had been here. Their murder was huge, the equipment looking like a giant crow as they sat on every empty surface. It was a mass of wings and feathers and beady black eyes, and I walked within that heaving black sea of avians.\n\nI came to the center far too soon.\n\nHe was standing on a merry-go-round, the metal battered and the paint faded and chipped. It looked as if it had been moved through time, and he stood in the middle of it as it turned ever so slowly. The crows guarded him, leaning closer as if making ready to charge me if I tried to attack him, and he seemed utterly at ease. He was dressed in the same black hat with feathers around the brim, the same black cloak, dark as a raven wing, and the same leather boots that looked like they had walked across the ages to be here. He looked like he could have known Vlad Tepes, could have watched an original Shakespeare play, could have wielded a knife as it slew Caesar. He was ageless, an engine of destruction as much as the one he stood upon, and as he turned, I saw the girl kneeling on the hot top. \n\nShe was tall for ten, looking like a woman more than a child, and when I took a step toward her, the man spoke.\n\n“Do not touch what belongs to the crows.”\n\nI stopped, despite myself, and as I looked up I finally got a look at him. His face was young, his hair a perfect salt and pepper, and his features were sharp and angular. He looked like a painting in a museum, a man out of time, and as he came fully around he looked like nothing so much as a demon in human form. His eyes, however, were what drew me the most. They sparkled, the cornea like the faucets of the gem. No wonder the crows followed him. His eyes were something they would desire above all other things, and I wondered if they would take them from him when his life finally came to an end.\n\nSomehow, despite being captivated by this strange man, I found the courage to speak. \n\n“She does not belong to you. She is of this school, and under its protection, under MY protection.”\n\nThe man sneered, “You would dare tell me what treasures I may take? This is my domain, and I take what I want.”\n\n“Not today,” I said, and the girl shook off whatever spell she had been under and began to hyperventilate.\n\n“Where...where...where am I?” she asked and I tried my best to calm her down.\n\nThat seemed to be what the crows were waiting for. They flew at us suddenly, buffeting the two of us with their wings and raking at us with their claws. Crows may not seem very formidable, but they're bigger than you think, and there were so many of them that all I could do was pick a direction and run. As long as it was away from the Crow Count, I didn't give a damn where it went. I pushed the girl in front of me, leading her through the throng of crows and getting pretty cut up in the process. I heard her scream as I covered her with my body, putting a hand over my face as I tried to save my eyes. We were running blind, bumping into things and rebounding back before we chose a different way. I felt like we would never make it out, that the crows would bury us under their mass or just carry us away. I didn't think I'd ever see my class, my students, or anything ever again, and that was when I stumbled out of the cloud and out of the playground.\n\nI lay on the ground, covering myself, but the crows were gone. I was breathing heavily, reaching for the girl to reassure her, but she wasn't there. I looked around, trying to find her, but she was just gone. Where was she? Had she escaped? What had...but that was when I heard a massive push of wings and the raised voice of the murder. \n\nAs I looked up, they all took flight at once, ascending into the sky in a great wave of black wings. In the middle of the cloud, held between the claws of many, many crows, were a pair of people that were soon lost amongst the cloud. One in a tall hat and cloak and another in the uniform our students wear. All I could do was watch them go, the tears coming as the murder took flight and left our playground behind.\n\nThe other teachers came up then, helping me to my feet as they took me to the office.\n\nThe principal was expecting me, and she told me to take a seat as the nurse came in to treat the multiple cuts and abrasions.\n\n“I'm sorry you had to learn about it this way. It's why we don't often hire outsiders, they don't understand, and it gets many of them killed, or worse.”\n\nI had a thousand questions, but I was in shock, and I could not vocalize any of them.\n\n“The Crow Count is a part of the town's history. He's something that has always existed and always will. He comes, he takes, he leaves. In the years he does not take, we celebrate. In the years when he does, we mourn. That's why we have the Crow Warnings, why we teach our kids to be on their guard, and why the parents are so fearful. We know he will take if we give him the chance. There is nothing we can do about it. The Crow Count is old and clever, and nothing will stop him. Best to accept it, he never takes more than we can afford.”\n\nI wondered if the parents I saw consoling each other as I went to leave would agree that it had been a price they could afford.\n\nI'm sitting in my apartment now, and I'm three sheets to the wind.\n\nI don't know if I can keep teaching here, knowing that the Crow Count will be back again, but I don't know what else I would do. I love the job and I love the kids, and if I can keep them safe, then don't I owe it to them to stay? Also, I want to know more about this thing. I want to know what it's here and how it came to be here.\n\nAlso, I want to know why it takes them and what it does with them once it has them.\n\nAbove all else, I want to know how we can stop this from happening, and stop the crows from stealing what is most precious to us.   "

        "selftext": "In 2017 me and my friend Alex were a little curious about a bunker near my village so we decided to ask the other villagers about it but they all looked scared when we mentioned it,as if they were hiding something.We thought that they arent taking us seriously so we decided to find it and go in.Little did we know this was the biggest mistake of our lives. The bunker itself  was around 10 minutes hiking up in the mountain so we went in and on our way there we saw a big fence and in it a little hole that somehow we managed to  enter through it and we soon saw the bunker.This looked like a normal bunker  to us and we were asking each other what could they be hiding if this was a normal bunker.We tried hard to  open it  but we  couldnt .After a lot of hard work we managed to open it and a lot of dust came out.We  decided to go down.This wasnt an ordinary bunker ,it had a lot of tunnels and abandoned furniture stacked as if there was something hidden in the tunnel or they were trying to stop something.We did our best to remove it and we managed to remove only a small part and we went through.We found a map layout of the so called bunker called C-16 that had 7 floors Level 0-checkpoint 1-security 2-laboratory and the other ones were torn off.We decided to explore it.On our way through level 0 we found a lot of disturbing items and even decayed human organs.This made us sick to our stomachs .There were knifes with blood and intestines all over the place and there was only one room on floor 0 which was canteen with food in perfect condition as if it was made now while the entire place was covered in dust and we asked each other how is this even possible,we descended to floor 1 and we saw a book with a title \"Check book\" and we decided to see what it was about.In it there were written dates and results of we thought human experiments.In the check book it said 25th January 1992 -successful change in atoms in human bodies 14th February 1992 -Subjects develop superhuman strenght and start to lose recognisable creatures 4th April 1992-Subjects are confirmed to have became mentally insane with incurable diseases. July 3rd 1992-Subjects are removed from the human category after breaking titanium with bare hands and murdering 6 scientists.They are locked in a single room ,17th August 1992 -Subjects have escaped from the room ,Mobilize the armed forces I repeat Mobilize the armed forces ,9th december 1992- Threat Contained ,And in big letters being written on the bottom of the last page \"DO NOT DESCEND FROM FLOOR 3 OR YOU WILL BE PUTTING ALL OF THE WORLD IN DANGER\" we did not understand exactly what they meant when they said this. There was again only one room on this floor but in this one there was a video tape and an old tv like the soviet ones and we decided to play it and what we saw gave us the most uneasy feeling.We saw  the \n 6 scientists in a room with the \"subjects\" being brutally killed and eaten.The tape ended right after .Our curiosity won and we descended to floor 2.\n\nAs we descended to floor 2, the air grew colder, and the faint, distant hum of machinery echoed through the tunnels. The floor was dimly lit by our  flashlights, casting eerie shadows on the walls. We felt an overwhelming sense of dread, but our curiosity drove us forward.\n\nThe laboratory was a maze of shattered glass, overturned tables, and broken equipment. The walls were lined with old medical charts, and the smell of decay hung heavy in the air. We carefully navigated through the debris, our footsteps echoing ominously.\n\nIn the center of the lab, we found a large containment unit with a thick glass window. The inside was dark, but as we approached, we saw a faint outline of something moving. We shined our flashlights on it and gasped. It was one of the \"subjects\" described in the checkbook, a grotesque fusion of human and beast, with bulging muscles and glowing eyes. It looked at us with a mixture of rage and hunger.\n\nSuddenly, a loud crash echoed from the far end of the room. We turned to see another containment unit had been breached, its door hanging off its hinges. The room filled with an unsettling growl, and we realized the danger we were in. We had to get out, and fast.\n\nWe sprinted back towards the stairs, but the way was blocked by a third \"subject\" emerging from the shadows. This one was larger, more monstrous than the first, its movements unnaturally quick. We were trapped.\n\nThinking quickly, Alex grabbed a nearby metal pipe and swung it at the creature, buying us a few precious seconds to find another way out. We dashed through a side door into a narrow hallway, the sounds of pursuit echoing behind us.\n\nThe hallway led us deeper into the bunker, to a place not marked on the map we had found. Here, the walls were covered in strange symbols and writings, and the air felt thick and oppressive. We stumbled into a small room at the end of the corridor, slamming the door shut behind us.\n\nInside, we found a control panel covered in dust. Desperately, we started pressing buttons, hoping to find a way to seal the floor or activate an emergency protocol. The lights flickered and a loud alarm blared, but nothing seemed to be happening.\n\nJust when we thought all hope was lost, a hidden door behind the control panel slid open, revealing a narrow escape tunnel. We didn't hesitate. We crawled through the tunnel, the sounds of the creatures' growls growing fainter behind us.\n\nThe tunnel led us outside, into the forest, far from the entrance we had used. We emerged, covered in dust and trembling, but alive. As we looked back at the hidden entrance, we vowed never to speak of what we had seen to anyone. The forest remained silent, its dark secrets buried deep within.\n\nTo this day, the memories of that night haunt me. The nightmares of those creatures, the horrors of the lab, and the knowledge that something truly evil lurks beneath the ground. We may have escaped, but the terror of that place will stay with us forever.\n\nBut one day as I started talking with Alex at the local shop he offered me to go back in and see what happened.At first I thought he was crazy ,but he somehow managed to convince me.\n\n\nDespite our pact of silence, the events of that night lingered in our minds, gnawing at us both. Nights were plagued by relentless nightmares and the unshakable feeling that we were being watched. I often awoke in cold sweats, the monstrous faces of the \"subjects\" still vivid behind my closed eyelids. Alex and I grew distant, each dealing with our trauma in different ways and we couldnt really organize to go back in together.\n\nMonths passed, and one evening, Alex contacted me out of the blue. He sounded anxious and determined. “We need to go back in” he said.\n\nReluctantly, I agreed. We planned our return meticulously, armed with a more robust flashlight, a crowbar, and a camera. The forest was eerily quiet as we made our way back to the bunker, the villagers’ fearful glances still fresh in my memory.\n\nThe entrance to the bunker was as we had left it, partially obscured by overgrown foliage. We forced the door open and descended the stairs, the air inside stale and suffocating. We bypassed the grim remnants of Level 0 and 1, heading directly to the laboratory on Level 2.\n\nThe containment unit on Level 2 stood ominously empty. The creatures were nowhere to be seen, but the tension in the air was palpable. We located the hidden door behind the control panel and squeezed through the escape tunnel, feeling a mixture of dread and determination.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we made several return trips. Each visit unveiled more of the bunker’s secrets. We discovered hidden passageways, obscured rooms, and cryptic notes hinting at the horrors below. Our goal was clear: we needed to understand what lay beyond Level 3.\n\nOne evening, we descended to Level 3, the ominous warning from the checkbook still echoing in our minds: “DO NOT DESCEND FROM FLOOR 3 OR YOU WILL BE PUTTING ALL OF THE WORLD IN DANGER.” The air was colder, the lights dimmer. Reinforced steel walls and thick doors indicated the severity of the containment measures.\n\nIn the first room, a security checkpoint, we found an old journal with the last entry dated September 12th, 1992. The author described frantic attempts to contain the escaped subjects and desperate measures to seal off the lower levels. The final words sent chills down my spine: “God help us all. They are evolving.”\n\nMoving deeper into Level 3, we entered an armory. Weapons and ammunition were scattered about, suggesting a last stand. We armed ourselves with a rifle and grenades, readying ourselves for what lay ahead. At the end of a long corridor, we found the entrance to Level 4.\n\nLevel 4 was unexpectedly different from the rest. Instead of the grim surroundings we had anticipated, we found ourselves in another  cafeteria. It  was even more  eerily well-preserved, with tables and chairs arranged neatly and food still on the plates. It was as though the cafeteria had been frozen in time, untouched by the decay that plagued the rest of the bunker. The sight was unsettling, considering the horrors we knew lay below.\n\nAs we explored Level 4, we noticed that the entrance to Level 5 was blocked by a heavy metal door, sealed shut and reinforced. We couldn't access it. Frustrated but undeterred, we retraced our steps and headed back to Level 3. Our only option was to descend further into Level 5 through an alternative route we had previously missed.\n\nWe finally reached Level 5, the industrial factory. The level was a labyrinth of massive machinery, conveyor belts, and vats of strange liquids. The air was thick with a chemical stench, and the sound of clanking metal reverberated through the cavernous space. It was evident that this level was used for maintaining or producing the subjects. The sight of the machinery was both fascinating and horrifying.\n\nAs we moved cautiously through the industrial maze, we heard a low, ominous growl. Before we could react, the growl turned into a full-blown roar, and we saw several of the evolved subjects charging toward us. They were more terrifying and powerful than any we had seen before, their forms a grotesque fusion of human and beast.\n\nPanic set in as we realized we were surrounded. Alex and I fought desperately, using the rifle and grenades we had scavenged from the armory. The creatures were relentless, and despite our best efforts, we were pushed back. One of the grenades exploded, creating a temporary barrier and giving us a brief reprieve.\n\nIn our frantic attempt to escape, we noticed that the entrance to Level 6 was accessible through a hidden passageway behind a large piece of machinery. We raced toward it, narrowly avoiding several attacks from the subjects. The passage was tight and dark, but it offered a chance to escape the immediate danger.\n\nDescending into Level 6, we entered a large research lab. The level was filled with detailed records, blueprints, and diagrams of the subjects. We discovered several logs detailing the progression of the experiments and the failures of the containment measures. The records revealed that Level 6 was intended as a research hub for further studying and managing the subjects.\n\nAmong the documents, we found information about a special preservation capsule on Level 7 that was reportedly used for containing important figures involved in the project. Our curiosity piqued, we decided to descend to Level 7 to investigate further.\n\nLevel 7 was shrouded in darkness, with only faint emergency lights casting a dim glow. The space was vast and industrial, with large, metallic preservation capsules arranged in a row. In one of these capsules, we found three scientists, preserved in a state that appeared too modern for the rest of the bunker. They were unconscious but alive, a sign that they had been placed in a preservation state to survive the chaos.\n\nWe woke them gently, and after some confusion and panic, the scientists revealed their knowledge. They explained that the bunker was part of a secret military project aimed at creating superhuman soldiers. The experiments had gone horribly wrong, leading to the creation of the monstrous subjects we had encountered.\n\nAs the scientists gave us crucial information about the bunker’s purpose, an ear-splitting roar echoed through the level. We turned to see one of the evolved subjects emerging from the shadows. This creature was different from the others—its strength and speed were inhumane. Its sheer presence radiated danger.\n\nThe scientists’ faces turned pale with fear. “We need to get out, now!” one of them shouted. We scrambled to escape, but the creature charged at us with terrifying speed. Alex, the scientists, and I raced through the corridors, the creature’s growls growing louder behind us.\n\nNavigating the darkened hallways and using every ounce of our remaining energy, we made our way back to Level 6. The creature was relentless, and its presence was an ever-looming threat. As we reached the emergency exit to the surface, we barely managed to slip through, slamming the door shut behind us.\n\nPanting and covered in sweat, we emerged into the forest, the entrance to the bunker now partially obscured and sealed. The scientists, though shaken, were grateful for their rescue. They provided us with more details about the bunker’s experiments and the true extent of the military project.\n\nReturning to our village, the locals were in disbelief seeing the scientists  that dissapeared over 30 years ago alive and visibly no changes in them.\nThe special forces were sent  quickly to seal the bunker and they took us with them to be interrogated for hours and in the end we had to sign a contract  that we keep everything we know about the bunker highly confidential or there will be consequences.\n\n\nFew months later me and Alex have moved into a new town far away from the village and the bunker for the sake of our mental health.My life has  been gradually improving ,but to this day i still get nightmares from my near death experiences.\n\n"

        "selftext": "\r  \n\r  \nDid anyone else become a participant in the social experiment known as Flat Stanely?\r  \n\r  \nI went to elementary school in the mid-nineties (95-2001) and I was in third grade when our teacher announced that we would be taking part in the Flat Stanley Project. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept, Flat Stanley was a series of books about this flat kid who goes on all these weird adventures to famous places. New York, The Grand Canyon, France, Australia, this guy went everywhere and was like a flat version of Curious George. We started reading them in class, making them part of our English hour, and one day Mrs. Gazle told us we were going to have a contest.\r  \n\r  \n\"Today's English lesson is to create your own Flat Stanley. It can look however you want, but the winner of the contest will get three prizes from the prize basket, and be the classes Flat Stanley that we send into the world to participate in the Flat Stanley Project.\"\r  \n\r  \nWe were all excited. This was a chance to see our work in the pictures that would come back, not to mention get some cool stuff from the prize basket. We all drew out our own concept for Flat Stanley and set to work coloring and designing him. My Flat Stanley was a spy, wearing a big trench coat, a wide hat, and carrying binoculars. He wore his regular clothes under it, and he just looked so goofy that I thought I had a real chance of winning. My friend, Todd, laughed when he glanced over at it, telling me it was cool. His Flat Stanley was a football player for the Georgia Bulldogs, his favorite team, and I thought his Stanley looked cool too. \r  \n\r  \nSo when the class voted on the displayed Stanleys, I figured Kaylies Flat Stephany would win. It had a sparkly tiara and a ball gown she had made with felt. That was the one I had voted for at least, since we couldn't vote for our own, and if not hers, I figured Matts would win. His Flat Stanley was a truck driver, complete with a net hat and sleeveless t-shirt, and he had put a lot of work into it. I knew some kids thought mine was funny, but I didn't figure I stood a chance. I hadn't used any special materials or done anything really innovative, and I figured I'd hang him in my room when I got him back.\r  \n\r  \nSo when Mrs. Gazle announced that my Flat Stanley had won, I was shocked.\r  \n\r  \nI went home that night with a new super bounce ball, a pocket-sized Stretch Arm Strong, and an eraser shaped like a Pikachu.\r  \n\r  \nI also went home to tell my Mom that I had won the contest and that my Flat Stanley would be going out to other schools and other places so we could get pictures back and see all the cool places he'd been. She said that sounded really neat, and we brainstormed where he might end up. Paris, DisneyLand, the Moon (we both laughed about that one), or maybe even at an Atlanta Braves baseball game. We had a good afternoon thinking about where he might end up, and when Dad got home he joined us in our daydreaming.\r  \n\r  \nI went to bed that night thinking of all the cool places Stanley might go, and what we might see when he came back. \r  \n\r  \nIt started out pretty normal. Mrs. Gazle sent the package out to a school the next town over and they sent us back pictures a week later. Stanley had been to a volleyball game, an art museum, and finally to play put on by the class. They sent it up the road to the next school, where Stanley went on a hike, went to the zoo, and then to a baseball game. It wasn't the Atlanta Brave, it was a t-ball game, but it was still neat. This went on for a couple months, Flat Stanley traveling to Texas, New Mexico, California, Idaho, and Kansas. We hung the pictures up, sent out thank you cards, and talked about the places that Flat Stanley had gone to. It was a good time, and we used it in our Geography class to help us learn our states. It seemed that Flat Stanley was in all our lessons that year. Math (if Flat Stanley travels from Burbank California to El Paso Texas, how far has he traveled?), Geography (If Flat Stanley is at the Alamo, then where is he?), and of course English where we read the books and the letters we got out loud. \r  \n\r  \nIt was approaching April when we came to class to find that Mrs. Gazle wasn't there. We were all pretty bummed, because Wednesdays were usually when we got our Flat Stanley letters, and the sub told us that Mr. Gazle would talk about it when she got back. There was no Flat Stanley that day, and when Mr. Gazle came back the following week, we moved on to something else. All the Flat Stanley stuff had disappeared from the class, and its absence was as noticeable as our missing teacher had been.\r  \n\r  \nShe never told what had happened, and it was a mystery talked about in hushed tones well into the fourth grade.\r  \n\r  \nIt would probably still be a mystery if I hadn't decided a decade later to pursue teaching.\r  \n\r  \nI'm in my second year of college now, and I've progressed into student teaching. I decided that I wanted to try my hand at being an elementary school teacher, something like fourth or fifth grade, and when they gave me the name of my mentor, I realized I knew her. It was Mrs. Gazle, my old third-grade teacher. She taught fifth grade now, her retirement coming up on the horizon, and she smiled when she realized who I was, giving me a big hug.\r  \n\r  \n\"Welcome back, I'm glad to see you decided to take up teaching.\"\r  \n\r  \nHer classroom was in the same room her third-grade class had been in, and the kids reminded me a lot of me and my friends when we had been her students. She had a good group. They were hungry to learn, and they liked her a lot. Mrs. Gazle was the kind of teacher who kept kids' attention effortlessly, and I hoped it was a skill I would learn from her. The kiddos in her class took to me pretty quickly, and soon I was teaching classes while Mrs. Gazle just sat back and observed.\r  \n\r  \nSomething about being in her class again made me remember my days as a third grader at this school, and that made me think about Flat Stanley again. There was nothing like that in her fifth-grade class, the kids would have probably thought it was babyish, but it did rekindle some of the mystery I had felt from a decade before. I tried to find a good time to bring it up, but nothing seemed to present itself.\r  \n\r  \nUntil Friday of my second week. \r  \n\r  \nI was packing up to leave when Mrs. Gazle offered to take me out for drinks. I was a little surprised, and she must have noticed because she laughed airily at my look of chagrin.\r  \n\r  \n\"What?\" she asked, her coat over one arm, \"You didn't know teachers drank?\"\r  \n\r  \nI decided to join her and found a small group of other teachers waiting for us when we arrived. Some of them I knew, most of them I didn't, but it turned out that this was a regular thing for them. They drank and talked about their week, complaining about some students who were especially difficult, and generally blew off steam. Mrs. Gazle and I sat in the corner, nodding and listening to them, and she smiled at me over the lip of her fourth glass of wine sometime near eleven.\r  \n\r  \n\"I've been sending glowing reviews to your professors,\" she confided, \"You're one of the better student teachers I've ever worked with. I think you're probably a shoo-in to be hired at the end of your training period, and I'll recommend you to the principal myself if he doesn't extend you a position.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thanked her, sipping my second beer as I took it all in.\r  \n\r  \n\"Hey, can I ask you something?\" I said suddenly.\r  \n\r  \n\"Neither of us is nearly drunk enough for you to offer me a ride home yet, big fella,\" she said, snorting into her glass.\r  \n\r  \n\"No, no, nothing like that. Something's always bugged me from my time in your class, and I was wondering if you remembered the Flat Stanley Project we did?\"\r  \n\r  \nSome of the color fled from her cheeks and I could swear she shuddered a little.\r  \n\r  \n\"I'm surprised you even remember that. It was a long time ago.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Well, everything disappeared from the class so quickly, and when you came back you never brought it up again. All the books were gone from the class library, all the letters were gone, everything was missing. I think we talked about it for half of the fourth grade before something else caught our attention.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe looked far away for a moment as if contemplating whether she actually wanted to answer me or not.\r  \n\r  \n\"I think I need a little air. Would you care to escort me?\"\r  \n\r  \nI told I would, and we left amidst a hail of catcalls about \"cradle robbers\" and \"cougars on the prowl.\" I had taken her arm, and she was trying to be unbothered by it, but she was stiff and a little unsteady as we walked out onto the patio. Something had her spooked, and I didn't think it was the half-hearted teasing of her peers.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we came outside, she leaned against the railing outside the seating area, looking at the waves as they crashed against the water below us.\r  \n\r  \nI came to lean beside her, realizing she was trying to figure out where to begin, and having trouble getting started.\r  \n\r  \n\"Are you sure you wanna know? That's a pretty messed up story, but I suppose we could count it as a part of your education. Maybe it'll help you avoid something that got me in a lot of hot water and canceled the Flat Stanley Project for the whole school.\"\r  \n\r  \nI told her I did, pretty intrigued with what could have happened to make a whole school ban something as benign as a kid's art project. \r  \n\r  \n\"Well, you remember that we sent the little guy around to a school in the next town over? Well, they sent it to another school, and that school sent it to another school, and so on and so forth. We had about the best result of any other classes, getting back twice as much material as is normal. I started integrating it into the curriculum, as you remember, and it was such a huge part of our class. I appreciated the material, sometimes it's hard to keep kids' attention when they're that young, but Stanley really helped. Then, one day, I arrived to find that a new package had come the day before.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe stopped, shivering a little as she watched the waves.\r  \n\r  \n\"Someone had sent our Flat Stanley back, and I was excited as I opened the envelope. We were starting fractions that day, at least, we were supposed to, and I wanted to see if there was some way I could work fractions into the package. I would get my wish, but not in the way I wanted.\"\r  \n\r  \nI had reached into my pocket for a cigarette, and Mrs. Gazle asked if she could have one. \r  \n\r  \nI had never seen her smoke before, but as she inhaled that first mouthful, she closed her eyes and looked euphoric.\r  \n\r  \n\"Flat Stanley was supposed to go to Carter Wilde Elementary school in Boise, but it appeared he had gone somewhere else. You're too young to remember it, but there was a pretty terrible person in the Midwest in the late nineties. He was picking up young women who were hitchhiking, and the police would find them later after he was done with them. Somehow, he got our Flat Stanley and thought it would be funny to use him to taunt the police. He had murdered five girls that week,\" her voice broke as she said it, the tip of the cigarette jittering as she spoke, \"and attached pictures of them to the Stanley he sent back. They were horrific, and as I spilled them out on my desk, I recognized what I had at once.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe was shaking, and as I put my jacket around her, she smiled ruefully at me.\r  \n\r  \n\"You're a good kid, despite making me relive this. We knew that the kids in my class had all kinds of wild ideas about what had happened, but we also knew that none of you knew the truth.\"\r  \n\r  \nShe took a long pull off the cigarette and let the ash dribble down.\r  \n\r  \n\"The first girl he sent pictures of was Ashley Mankse. He had cut her chest open, the X going right between her breasts, and skinned her open like some kind of flower. Her face was set in the worst possible look you've ever seen, and right there in the middle of her chest, was Flat Stanley; YOUR Flat Stanley.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought I got it then, but Mrs. Gazle hadn't even got rolling yet.\r  \n\r  \n\"Then there was Francis Carmichael, the girl he took from the fair. She was looking for a ride, and he gave her one. He cut her arms and legs off while she was alive, burning the wounds closed with an iron so she'd bleed out slower. He finally cut her throat, and after that, he put one foot from that Flat Stanley in her teeth and took a picture. He was standing upright, her body on display, and her burnt nubs are something I still can't quite get out of my head.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I'm sorry,\" I started, but she cut me off.\r  \n\r  \n\"No, no. You wanted to know, so let me get it all out. It's like the confessional I used to go to when I was little. If I get it all out, maybe it won't haunt me as bad. He got Dawn Caimbridge and Betsy Caimbridge next, split their backs, and made a pair of blood angels out of them. He set Flat Stanley in the middle of them, the crevice between their sides, and snapped a picture. They were still looking for them when they found Ashley. Finally, he got Melanie Fasterly, and she was probably the worst. He beat her with a sledgehammer until her bones were like glass shards. The picture he sent back was unrecognizable as a human being, and if it hadn't been for the hair I would have never known what it was. He stood the cut out between her lumpy legs as if to save her modesty, and she honestly looked about as flat as he was if you don't count all the bone spurs sticking out of her.\"\r  \n\r  \nMrs. Gazle's jaw was shaking, the skivering causing her to stutter over the last few words, and when she looked back at me, there was regret on her face. All the alcohol had been burned out of her, the fear having shaken it all loose as her mind remembered what had likely been the worst day of her life. \r  \n\r  \n\"I called the police, of course, but my real concern was for you guys. If this psycho had mailed this back to us, then he had the address of the school. If he knew where we were, then he could pay us a visit and make us his next photo collage, and I couldn't have lived with myself if that had happened. So, I gave the police everything, and they agreed to keep an eye on the school for a while. I needn't have bothered. This twisted fuck had a particular hunting ground and a particular prey, neither of which were children in Georgia. He never did pay us a visit, but it took six more girls before they caught him. I didn't sleep well until they had him in custody, and I didn't sleep soundly until they slipped the needle into him last year. He was a rotten, twisted individual, and he deserved every ounce of what he got. I had to take the rest of the week to recover from his little present, and there was talk that they might want me to undergo counseling. When I got back, the school had scrapped all the Flat Stanley stuff. It was too much of a risk that some students would get a hold of it next time, and they couldn't have that. Some of the teachers thought we should tell the students, some of them thought we should tell the parents and a few of them thought I should be fired for some reason. It was decided that we wouldn't tell any of them, and we would never speak of it again. In exchange for not causing an uproar, I got to keep my job. I thought it was a pretty fitting trade back then. So that's the whole sad story, cure your curiosity?\"\r  \n\r  \nIt did.\r  \n\r  \nMrs. Gazle was right, too. They offered me a job at the end of my training, and it turned out it was her job. Mrs. Gazle retired at the end of that year, wanting to spend more time with her grandkids and her daughters. We still get drinks sometimes, and she really is a lovely woman. As for me, I noticed one major part of the contract as it was presented to me. They put it in bold so you can't possibly miss it, and so if you break it, you really only have yourself to blame.\r  \n\r  \nUnder no circumstances will our students participate in any program that sends documents to other schools or entities without the express permission of the administration. This includes penpal programs, Hands Across the Water, the Flat Stanley Project, and other affiliated projects there within.\r  \n\r  \nI signed that contract ten years ago, and now I instruct student teachers myself.\r  \n\r  \nIn the decade I've been teaching, I have never broken that rule, and I have Mrs. Gazle's story to thank for that. \r  \n\r  \nWhen you send something like that out into the world, you never know who might answer back, and what they might have to say.  \r  \n"

        "selftext": "https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1bfb6lq\/beyond_dollar_general_beyond_pt_1\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nHey everybody, Alphabet man here.\n\nDo you know what the best part about being back on this side of reality is?\n\nI can actually ANSWER your questions!\n\nSo, to recap, Gail and Celene almost got snapped up miasma that appeared in my freaking house. So, we talked about it and came up with a plan of attack. Well, Gail wants to attack, anyway, so I agreed that it might be time to arm ourselves with something that would stop them if they came back. Like some of you suggested, we have kitted out the house for optimal dispersal of miasma. Every light bulb in the house has been upgraded to the highest wattage I can get and the biggest lumen count available. We've also added lights in places that don't seem to have enough lights. Every room has at least one new lamp or tap light in it, and it makes even the dreariest room shine like the sun. We also got some of those jog lights for ourselves, the ones that make light so people can see you at night. We even got one for Buddy, a collar that makes him look like a one-dog rave. We all have those deer spotting lights that can flag down plains, and we're working on changing our sleep schedules so we can stay vigilant all night. I've never been one for night shifts so that part has taken some getting used to.\n\nIf I sound a little crabby while writing this, that's why.\n\nI suggested that it might be a good idea to reach out to people who knew more about this than we do, but Gale wouldn't hear of it.\n\n\"You want to let them know where we all are?\" he said, sounding incredulous.\n\n\"Gale, they already know where we are,\" I said, trying to stay calm in the face of his mounting hysterics.\n\nI hadn't known Gale long, even though we had been through a lot, but this seemed out of place for him. The Gale I had known in the DGB, at least the Gale I'd known before he had gone into the ceiling, had always been resourceful and not prone to letting his emotions get the better of him like this. Even when he was overwhelmed, he always seemed to keep it together and make a plan. This Gale seemed barely in control of himself, and his paranoia was at an all-time high.\n\nThough, I suppose, if shadow creatures had come to grab me in the middle of the night, I might be a little paranoid too.\n\n\"I don't want them knowing a damn thing about us. They're in league with those things. Hell, they probably ARE those things. We tell them that we know what they're up to and we give away our advantage.\"\n\n\"What advantage is that?\" I asked Gale, \"They know we all live together in a house that I bought with the money they gave me? Come on, Gale. They probably know when we take a dump and how much it weighs. These guys aren't some Scooby Doo villain. These guys are organized, but if they think that we might blab to the wrong people, then they might leave us alone again.\"\n\nGale blew air out of his nose, sounding agitated.\n\n\"If you go to them, then I'm leaving.\"\n\nA silence hung between us as the words sank in.\n\n\"Gale!\" Celene said, but he cut her off.\n\n\"If you're going to lead them straight to us, then I'll just go ahead and take my chances on my own. I might be harder to find if I just keep moving.\"\n\nI wanted to rail at him, I wanted to make him see reason, but after a moment of just staring at him, I put my hands up and sighed.\n\n\"Fine, I won't call them. But we need to figure out what's going to happen then because tonight it was pretty clear that we had no clue what we were doing.\"\n\nThat was when we made plans to set up the defenses I talked about earlier, and ultimately what brought us to this point. We've been staying up all night and sleeping most of the day for the past week. Poor Buddy is taking it the hardest. The poor pooch was made to be a night dog, and he seems confused anytime I tell him to go back to bed when the sun's out. Usually, I just let him run in the backyard, but I always end up getting up to let him back in during the heat of the day. I'm lucky to get four hours of continuous sleep most days, and it feels like I'm just taking a series of cat naps. Gale seems to be doing the best out of us. He sits awake all night like it's his duty to guard us, then sleeps like the dead all day. Celene is doing pretty well, but I've caught her snoozing a time or two. \n\nThis would have probably been a lot easier if we had done it right after coming back from the Beyond. In the Beyond, you always slept with the lights on. In the Beyond, you always slept when you were too tired to go on. There was no night or day, there was just time, and you passed that time as best you could. We were used to it, but after a few months in the real world, we've gotten used to sleeping when the sun goes down and being awake when it comes up.\n\nIt's weird though.\n\nWhen I dream, I almost always dream that I'm back in the Beyond.\n\nI can hear the soft buzz of the overhead lights, the tinny music that plays on the speakers, and silence that seems to moan at you after a while.\n\nIn my dreams, I go back to the Beyond, but they aren't nightmares, not always. Sometimes I go back to that first store, the one I destroyed, and search through the rubble for something. I don't what it is, but I know that I need it. Whatever I'm looking for, I never find it. I sift through the rubble, looking and looking, but I never discover what I've lost. Sometimes I find little reminders of my store, however. One night I found a coloring book that I had done, the adult kind with lots of swirls and little pieces. I had to wipe coffee ground off it, the moisture having wrecked the picture, but even wet and saturated, it was still beautiful. I couldn't believe I had destroyed it in my anger, and as I flipped through the book, I noticed there were pages at the back that I hadn't finished. I didn't remember these pages, but that's because I don't think they existed when I was here. They showed a forest of terrible crystals, their beauty undeniable. Inside the crystals were people, and as I flipped, I could see them turning into dust inside. Big shadow creatures were moving around, and as beautiful as the crystals were, the creatures looked like crayon drawings next to their complexity. They were moving around the crystals, tending to them, and as I flipped, I saw them bring in someone new. I don't know how I knew, but I knew it was Gale. The book started flipping pages in my hand then, and the images moved like a picture book. As they set Gale into the crystal that would grow around him, they put something into him. It was...well, it was like the opposite of light but it still shone. I know that doesn't make any sense, but it's the best I can do. It was inside him before they sealed him up, and as the crystal grew around him, it shone out with a strange dark light. Eventually, I came along and smashed his crystal and pulled him out, but even as we escaped, I could see that shard of darkness glowing inside him.\n\nI wanted to tell them about the dream, but I knew Gale would scoff at it and Celene would just say it was nerves. \n\nI don't think it was, but I never got a chance.\n\nWe were attacked on the fourth night if you can call it an attack.\n\nMy neighbors probably thought I was insane because you could see my house from down the street. On the third day, we had to go get thicker curtains after the little old lady next door nicely asked me to turn my lights down because it was keeping her awake. If it had been the Karen that lived two houses down, I would probably told her to eat me raw, but Mrs. Gorbetts is such a nice old lady that I felt bad for keeping her awake. \n\nWe bought blackout curtains and that peel-and-stick stuff that blacks out your windows, and Mrs. Gorbetts told me she slept like a baby the next day when I went to get my mail.\n\nWe all sat in the living room at night, the TV on but none of us watching it. Buddy was asleep in his comfy bed by the couch, his snoring making me a little jealous. Celene and Gale were on the couch, Celene cuddled up next to Gale and Gale looking like one of those stuffed husbands you saw online for lonely women. I was in my Lazyboy, drinking coffee and yawning. We were watching an old black and white movie, that was really all that was worth watching that late at night, and I was just about to suggest we find something on Netflix when something touched down on the carpet hard enough to make the board creak above our heads. It was followed by a loud roar that made Buddy jump up and bark, but it was gone a moment later.\n\n\"What,\" I started, but Gale put a finger over his lips.\n\n\"They're testing our defenses,\" he whispered, and sure enough there was another one from my room a moment later. Same thump, same loud roar, and then silence. Celene sat up, looking nervous but ready, and Gale put his big ole flashlight in his lap like they might come out of the crevices of the couch after him. We all kept our lights close by, mine was on the end table, and as much as I doubted they could get us I still put a hand on mine.\n\n\"I think,\" but Gale stopped as something big and dark stepped out of the small shadow cast by the TV stand. \n\nIt rose to fill the room, but there was only so much shadow left. The shadows that remained were there to act like bear traps, or so Gale thought. He said if we covered all the shadows, then they might get desperate. If we left a couple, and they tried them, then it would tell them that they couldn't get far, and it wasn't worth the effort. \n\nThe miasma sent one huge hand out towards Gale, but it turned to nothing as it came into the ocean of light we were bathed in.\n\nWe put our flashlights on it and burned it to a crisp as it grumbled away to nothing.\n\nThat was all for that night's battle, but the war wasn't over. \n\nThe next two nights were spent probing for weaknesses.\n\nIt was surprising what the miasma could manifest from, and shadows we hadn't even considered were suddenly vantage points for them to come through. Some of these we took care of, some of them we left but made note of, but it never did them any good. The light stopped them, it made them as intangible as weak spirits, and we began to settle into our nocturnal lifestyle. It was easy since we didn't have jobs, or anywhere to be. My parents were a little concerned about why I was staying up all night and sleeping all day, but I told them I had a third-shift job at a call center and they bought it. Gale and Celene didn't even have that to contend with. Gales's family was either dead, estranged, or refused to believe it was him when he reached out. Celene was an only child with divorced parents, both of whom were dead. The cousins she had tried to reach out to either didn't remember her, didn't care, or didn't believe her. She and Gale really just had each other, and me, which was probably why we had clung so close together. Even my parents didn't really understand what I had been through, though I didn't tell them more than they needed to know, and it had brought the three of us, four if you counted Buddy, into a found family built on shared trauma.\n\nSo, when Friday came we were all on high alert. We had been attacked three nights running, and we fully expected tonight to be the big one. This would be when they put all their knowledge together and launched something big. Despite his whining, we had turned Buddy's collar on and it was providing an eye-tearing show within the living room. We had our lights, we had our reflectors, and we had even created some new shadows for them to test out. We were ready, all of us were used to staying up now and sitting in a kind of self-imposed preparedness.\n\nWhen the sun came up and nothing had happened, we were a little surprised.\n\nWhen Saturday night came, we did the same, and again nothing happened.\n\n\"Maybe they've given up,\" said Celene.\n\n\"Maybe they're trying to lure us into a false sense of security,\" Gale said, not buying it.\n\nSunday we were all on pins and needles. We let Buddy sleep without his collar on, he really was having trouble sleeping with all the lights flashing, but we still donned our jogging lights, our headlamps, and our giant flashlights. We sat at the ready, sure that tonight would be the night, and we jumped at every little noise. Any noise, any creak, any groan of wood could be the miasma, and by midnight we were all standing up, not wanting to be too comfy. Buddy looked at us, annoyed at being kept awake by us, but we refused to let our guard down.\n\nWhen they got here, we would be ready.\n\nWhen morning came, and still nothing had happened, Celene started to laugh.\n\n\"They must be having laughing fits if they can see us. They got us to stay up for three nights running on high alert and then didn't even show up.\"\n\nGale looked like he wanted to be mad, but he started laughing too.\n\n\"I guess we must be pretty silly.\"\n\n\"It's a good thing we got those thick curtains,\" Celene chimed in, really cackling now, \"or the neighbors would be having fits at the sight of us. We probably looked ridiculous, like we were waiting for vampires or something.\"\n\nI couldn't help it, I started laughing too. \n\nShe was right, we must look silly.\n\n\"Well, boys, we made it, I guess, and I think this calls for a celebration. What's say we all go get some breakfast before we turn in? I think I could eat about three stacks of pancakes at the Chuck House and a pound of bacon, what about you?\" she asked, turning to Gale.\n\nGale was still chuckling a little, \"I hope they have a horse, caught I imagine I could eat a deep-fried Clydesdale, with a side of hashbrowns.\"\n\nThat got me laughing again, and pretty soon Gale and I were hanging on each other in stitches.\n\nWe were sleep-deprived and running on the dregs of pure adrenaline, cut us some slack.\n\n\"Well then, let's get out of these reflectors and get some breakfast,\" Celene said, ditching the lights as she went to get her coat out of the hall closet. \n\nBuddy was barking as Gale and I finished up our laughter, and I thought it was because he was annoyed by us and all the noises we were making.\n\nWhen Celene screamed, I realized my mistake.\n\nWe both went running into the foyer, but it was already too late. \n\nWe had put tap lights in all the closets. We had changed out the weak bulbs for something that would fry cockroaches. We had been so careful to put as much light in every space imaginable, but we had forgotten about one spot.\n\nThe arm coming out of the coat closet in the foyer was as thick as a tree, and as it dragged Celene inside, she was screaming for Gale.\n\nHe jumped, trying to catch her hand, but he came up short.\n\nShe disappeared into the closet, her shriek abruptly cut off, and as Gale dug the flashlight out of his pocket, the little one that he always kept on him, we could both see by the narrow beam that that closet was empty.\n\nThat was around sunrise.\n\nIt's closer to noon now, and Gale is inconsolable. He's been opening the door to the closet, the closet that now has a new halogen bulb in it, for hours, but Celene is never inside. She's been taken, but we don't know where. We assume she's gone back to that monochrome area in the ceiling, the one Gale was trapped in, but we don't know. \n\nI made a phone call about an hour ago, a phone call I should have made from the start.\n\nGale can say what he likes, he can leave if that's what he wants, but I need answers.\n\nI have a meeting with Agent Cash tomorrow at noon.\n\nI will get to the bottom of this, and I will get Celene back.\n\nEven if it means I have to plunge right back into the Beyond to do it."

Nothing was wrong, we were enjoying our time just until i took a nap. Before my nap, my parents placed the tent and i helped them. We set up the blankets , pillows and a small fire to light up the room and make it warmer. But after my nap ,im sure that something weird happened. When i woke up, i had slept for 2 hours, and when i checked the time, it was 9pm. I wanted to ask my mom where the sandwiches were since she made them and i was hungry, and thats when i saw something sinister. Her eyes were white. Thats weird because my family has brown eyes all around, my dads side and my moms side, brown eyes. I asked her what was wrong, but she didnt answer. I tried to shake her arm for a response but then i heard a doll-like voice saying “ run now if you dont want to die, hes always listening, looking, smelling, and even killing. Whatever you do, DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH IT.” I took a step back, while starting to black out. I tried running but i was very dizzy so i had no actual idea on where i was going. I think i blacked out because when i woke up, i checked my phone and it was 3am. I looked around and there were just bushes and trees all around. No moonlight to be seen. In the corner of my eye, i saw a man-like , black silhouette with no eyes, no teeth, no tongue, but its mouth was open. This is the best way i can describe it, because the way it looked, made me gag. \nI wanted to get a better look, but then i remembered what my mom said. I noticed that it was getting closer every blink i took. It got so close, until i couldnt stand it anymore so i did tue dumb idea to look at it.\nPause. The black silhouette paused. It screeched while saying something like:   \n“Oh Sofia, you made a terrific mistake. “ \nThat voice sounded oddly familiar, so i checked on thing that would determine it all, my dads birthmark. My dads birthmark is a square-shaped mole on the corner of his mouth. There it was. That was my dad. He looked just like my mom: white eyes, and terrified. \nIt started chasing after me, while i ran without seeing, cause my eyes were blurry. \n\n\nA small update, im hiding right now, behind some bushes. Im thristy and hungry, and i dont know what ill do. I do hear some movement in the bushes behind me , but thats it. I dont know if ill make it through. Peace out for now..\n\n\n\nWritten by: s_ofia_ \n!! fake !!"

        "selftext": "I'm writing this story now so I do not leave any details out if I write this later. To give context, I work at a sheriff's office as a 911 dispatcher. Not too busy of a county, but busy enough to where we normally don't jump out of our seats when someone calls 911. Nothing short of a few traffic stops and a couple disturbances throughout the night. Everyone in the \"radio room\" were talking to a couple of deputies and officers that stepped in to chat with us. At around 1AM, we received a 911 call from a 911 only number. For those unaware, they only call 911 and we are unable to call that number back. I picked up the call and I said my usual \"_____ County 911, what's the location of your emergency?\" Usually, we hear someone talking back or rustling around as if someone butt dialed 911 (it happens often, so we know exactly what it sounds like). This time, however, was definitely different. I heard absolutely nothing. No static, no voices, no wind, no rustling.. nothing. I activated my TTY (TeleTypeWriter), to see if they were hearing or speech impaired and no response back. I turned my volume up to see if there was anything or anybody in the distance, and nothing. I looked on our map to see the location of where the ping was coming from, nothing. I wrote the number down on a notepad just in case I could call the number back. Then, as I was about to hang up, I heard it. It was the slightest movement as if someone touched the phone. That right there, gave me hope. This call felt different from the start, but that slight nudge on the phone sent chills down my spine for some reason. I asked and asked if anyone was there, if they could hear me, if they needed police, fire, or an ambulance.. and once again.. nothing. I feel as if I lost whoever or whatever tried talking to me. I initially gave up, thinking it was just a glitchy phone that someone had in their pocket while they were sleeping. I made this excuse to make myself feel better. I hung up the call and sat back in my chair, thinking what it could've been. I was trying to make sense of it and not let it get to me, but it eventually did. I sat back up and decided to dial the number.. since it was a 911 only number, I had no hope of it connecting to their phone since the number we dial back with isn't 911. The phone dials and dials and dials.. eventually, we received another 911 call, but it was from our phone number. In my head, I thought that number that called us initially was one of the other dispatchers that accidentally dialed us. In actuality, the phone I dialed with only picked up 911 and connected it to us. That's the point where I gave up. I had no way of contacting the initial caller, until about ten minutes later.. that same number calls back. I immediately answer and try and try and try to get something out of that second phone call.. and just like before, I get nothing. It was until my supervisor jumped in and told me there's no hope in trying anymore. I acknowledged and was going through all the steps I had to take to make sure there was nobody there. Just like every other time, I get nothing back. That's when I reach for the hang up button and hover over it for one more second before I hear a click and the most blood curdling, heart wrenching, petrified scream that has ever been heard through my headset. Unfortunately, my reflexes were not fast enough and I clicked the hang up button before I even realized what had happen. I knew from the very beginning someone was there, and I tried everything in my power on those two phone calls to figure out who, what, where, and why they called 911.. but I was too late. They say no call is the same, but this one is by far the most unique and frightening call I think anyone has gotten. Thank you for reading my experience."

        "selftext": "\nI also feared putting a baby in my house. I didn’t want to put my girlfriend to go through the suffering that I had to deal with. Losing her first born child which I knew , even under the circumstances, she was already so in love with.\n\n2 weeks ago my ‘son’ was born. \n\nMy beautiful girlfriend passed away during his birth. It broke me knowing I couldn’t save her even though I had done everything to protect her from the burden that is this bloody house. The nightmares of her lifeless body covered by that white cloth are constantly running through my mind . Her parents refused to take the son , named Callum after my love . I knew then that I would have to take him to my house even through I truly didn’t want to. I didn’t want to have to lose my last link to the love of my life. I miss her so much. I need her.\n\nMy son was odd from the moment he was born. He was a c section baby because his exceptionally massive size meant any other way would risk both deaths. When I first met held my son , I already new something was wrong. Most babies cry when their born, but not Callum. He was completely silent apart from his quiet little breaths. He just stared into your soul with his big dark grey eyes. It felt wrong , something felt wrong. This child looked nothing like me or my girlfriend. Walst my girl was blonde with blue eyes and I was a ginger with bright green eyes and both fare skinned ; Callum had olive skin , brown nearly black hair and scarcely dark grey eyes , unlike any other baby I’d seen before. I don’t think this is right.\n\nThis all lead up to last week when I finally brought my son home. I was very on edge, knowing their was a good chance that I would be planning a funeral the day after.\n\nAfter 24 hours I was confused, thinking “why is he not dead , how is he not dead?”. My dog didn’t seem to like him , growling and snapping every time I tried to pick my son up. I can’t think why. My dog has never been aggressive towards anyone especially children but he seems to want to kill Callum. I think theirs something wrong with this baby especially since the ghosts haven’t done anything at all. It’s like their just as threatened and scared as the dog. What the hell can this tiny baby be doing to scare even the dead? This should be impossible? It’s just a little kid.\n\nTonight I had a sudden impulsive urge to check the baby monitor in the baby’s room. I had placed it in his room so to prevent the dog from attempting to hurt the baby . Only when I opened the app did I see something worse , something that physically couldn’t be right. I pinch myself to make sure I’m actually seeing this. The baby is sat straight up in the crib staring into the camera silently. What the fuck!. Maybe the ghost’s are messing with the camera . Even with my suspicions I begin to head up the stairs.\n\nI call the dog to me in case I need him but he never comes. Assuming he’s still asleep I continue up the stairs to the baby’s room\/nursery. \n\nThe door creaks open revealing the darkened children’s bedroom. I look over to the bed a instantly see the baby . Sitting straight up completely still , he now stares at me, soulless, emotionless. Something is definitely wrong with this child. After a couple of seconds I feel my foot slowly soaking into something. It feels wet and sticky, like some blood like substance. I look down . I desperately attempt to hold in the scream so to not wake the neighbours . On the ground is the destroyed body of an animal. Not just any animal, it’s the dog. Guts all across the room . Blood staining the carpet and half way up the baby blue nursery wall. It looks like some rabid animal has attacked him . I  didn’t here anything enter the house so what the hell has attacked him. I screech . Unexpectedly I then here another screech , an inhumane, sound unlike anything I’ve heard before.\n\nlooking up , back to the baby’s crib , only now the baby isn’t their. In its place is a tall black figure like a shadow . It has not a single feature on its face about from a large mouth with 3 layers shiny white teeth . It’s long black fingers and toes rap over the bars in an impossible angle for a human.\n\nI screech once again , bolting it out of the room and down the stairs. I desperately try to unlock the front door , still hearing that thing screech and roaring as it tried to get through the bedroom door , which I had thrown 2 chairs in front of before going down stairs. Finally I escape the house , running into the woods opposite my home as I hear clattering down the stairs.\n\nI get nearly a kilometre into the woods before I find a lightning struck tree that I can hide in. As I ran I could constantly hear booming steps behind me , chasing me further and further away. Now I can feel the sweat dripping down my forehead, and the wheezing coming from my chest. I’m now hiding in this tree trying to stay hidden.\n\nIm writing this in the tree right now. I don’t know how much longer I can hide. The sun is rising now and I can still here that thing screeching from behind me. It’s screaming for me too come out now and I can feel it getting closer to me.\nI finally understand why he’s not dead, he was never human at all."

Shortly after my arrival, every human who visited began to die completely out of the blue.\n\nI lived in a small town in the middle of Mississippi since I was very little . My life was a dream . A loving family and a well paying job that gave me a lot of freedom. I thought I had it all in till I moved into this place when I was 22. I had heard stories of this place . A family before me had been horrifically murdered in this house. Three kids , two parents and even the dog, a chocolate lab. They never found a cause or made an arrest . It seemed truly impossible. Since then it was claimed that the house was haunted by the family , attempting to kill human on the property unless . I didn’t believe in this until I actually saw it happen.\n\nFirst went my brother, dying in a car crash with seemingly no cause. At this point I still had no clue that I could possibly get any worse. Me and my brother were like best friends. \n\nOver the years after that, many more of my loved ones have passed. My best friend, 2 of my cousins, my parents and even my first girlfriend. Overdosing , shootings , fires and even a horrific murder . All having an errie similarity. Seemingly no cause. I was lead into a dark state of depression , so many loses . I feared the safety of my loved ones. I isolated myself and the pure hope that no one else would die because of my silly mistakes. How could a life go from being perfect , to living hell. Actually worse than hell. Like nonstop burning alive.\nI hired an exorcist , a priest and even many mediums in a desperate attempt to escape this hell. None of it worked. They proceeded to die in equally if not worse ways. They always made the ghost in this house particularly angry.\n\nI met my current girlfriend 5 years ago. As a devote Christian, her parents banned her from living with me or obviously, sleeping in the same bed. I greatly respected their wishes refusing to let her even enter my house. She didn’t understand that I was just trying to protect her.I love her. I didn’t want to lose her too…\n\nI’ve always noted that my girlfriend was very beautiful, I couldn’t believe that she had chosen me over so many better looking guys. I always feared that one day she would see this and cheat on me like I feared. She could get any man. With long blonde hair and those aquamarine eyes she was perfect. Even I knew that she could get any man she wanted . I didn’t know why she chose me but I thought for once , that she maybe truly did love me. I was so stupid.\n\nAt the beginning of this year , my girlfriend fell pregnant. Her parents were completely distraught, believing that I had been to bad of an influence on her, influencing her into having my child. They didn’t believe me as I desperately tried to convince them that I physically couldn’t have , I had never done that with anyone . I couldn’t possibly think why my girlfriend would possibly do this to me . She must have cheated. I thought we were both in love. I felt so betrayed.She desperately tried to convince me that she had never done anything with anyone. I knew that was physically impossible. I couldn’t believe that she could possibly think that I would be that stupid. Then again she was very serious about it. I wanted to believe her but I couldn’t."

        "selftext": "\nI'll always remember that Christmas when the storm blew in.\n\n\nThis was back in 82 or 83, and my family was living in a little house in North Georgia. Dad worked as a logger, Mom stayed at home to take care of me and my brother, and Grandpa had lived with us ever since Grandma died the year before. My Uncle and Aunt had come to stay with us for the holidays and my two cousins, Ella and Jasper, were sharing a room in the loft attic with me and my brother. Our little three-bedroom cabin seemed pretty cramped, but we all just thought it would be until after the holidays.\n\n\nThat was until the blizzard rolled in.\n\n\nIt was December twentieth, four days before Christmas, and we were all playing outside. The adults had said we were being too loud and had asked us to go out for a bit, so we put on our coats and mittens and went out to play. My brother wanted to play hide and seek, and my cousins and I, all of us about four to six years older than him, had agreed begrudgingly. We were too old for baby games, my youngest cousin a whole year older than me, but we agreed, mostly so we would have something to do.   \n\n\nSo Jasper and I were hiding under the porch, talking about something to do with hunting, I think, when I blinked as something drifted past my face. Jasper quieted as he noticed it, and I reached out my hand and caught a delicate-looking snowflake. I had seen snow before, you don't live in North Georgia for long without seeing some snow, but this was the first snow I thought might actually stick. It had been unseasonably warm for North Georgia, most days sitting around forty-five, and we had been worried that our white Christmas might be a bust.\n\n\nAs the snow began to fall harder, really coming down, we abandoned our game of hide and seek and devolved into little kids at the sight of all that powder. It was really amazing how quickly it came down, half a foot seeming to appear in minutes, and we began making snowmen, having snowball fights, and looking for the sleds in the tool shed so we could go to the holler and glide down with the fresh powder. Our parents came out onto the porch, looking in awe at all the snow, and when Dad tapped his little thermometer that hung next to the rain gauge, I realized that it was pushing fifty degrees. I didn't think about it at the time, but there was no way all that snow could be sticking. It was above freezing, and the snow should have been turning to slush before it hit the ground. \n\n\nTo us, it seemed like a Christmas miracle, but as the sun began to set and the adults went inside, I noticed Grandpa had come out and was looking at the sky with distrust.\n\n\nI watched him as he walked out to the wood pile and took a piece of stovewood back in with him, my distraction earning me a snowball upside the head from Ella.\n\n\nLooking back on it, Grandpa had to know what was coming, and even then he started getting ready for it.\n\n\nWe went to bed that night with visions of snowball fights and sledding dancing in our heads, but we woke up to a blizzard outside. Dad and Uncle went to stare at it on the porch, drinking coffee as they discussed what to do. Dad had laid by food, but he was worried that he didn't have enough for nine people long term. My Uncle joked that we could always eat Grandpa, but Dad said that would be like chewing on a boiled owl and they both laughed. Grandpa, on the other hand, was whittling something from the stove wood. He had been working on it through the night, and it kind of looked like a crossroads sign. It was thick through the middle, however, which made me think there might be more to it.\n\n\nI was too excited for another snow day, however, to pay Grandpa much mind. \n\n\nNot when there were winter festivities to get up to. My cousins and I played in the blizzard that day, but our games were muted some as the wind picked up and the snow began to fly. The wind was blowing too hard for our snowballs to fly straight. We tried sledding, but the snow was coming down too hard for us to see, and the ice that was forming hurt our ears and faces. By lunchtime, we were forced to come in out of the cold. Our coats, mittens, and hats were soaked through and after hanging them on the pegs in the mudroom, we went into the attic loft where we were all sleeping to warm up. We had all been set up in sleeping bags up here, my aunt and uncle taking the room I shared with my brother, and it was like having a little campout. The heat from the fire in the living room made it very warm up here, and as Jasper and I watched from the upper window, he leaned close to the glass and pointed into the woods.\n\n\n\"Do you see that?\" he asked.\n\n\nI squinted into the sea of white, trying to find it, and finally picked out a single silhouette. It looked like an animal, something on all fours, but it was gone as the winds blew up again, and we were both left looking at the snowy forest. He asked if I had seen it, probably trying to figure out if he had been seeing things, and I assured him I had seen it too.\n\n\nWe both sat by the window after the adults had gone to bed, looking out and hoping to catch a glimpse of something in the blowing snow.\n\n\nWe didn't see anything, at least I didn't, but we both assured the other that we could see all sorts of spooky things.\n\n\nThe next day, the blizzard was even worse.\n\n\nDecember twenty-second was too stormy for any of us to even think about going out to play, and when my Uncle and Father came out bundled to the eyes in several winter coats and the old deer skin britches they sometimes wore for winter work, I knew they intended to go out anyway. Mom told them they were crazy, but Dad said they needed supplies. The town was only about two miles north through the woods, and they would get the essentials and head back before lunch. He kissed my mom and told me to hold down the fort while he was gone. \n\n\n\"I should be back soon. It's only a couple of miles.\"\n\n\nThey set out at seven, just after breakfast, and I didn't envy them.\n\n\nWith the blizzard raging, we mostly sat around the house and watched TV. The set only got ten channels on a good day, and today we were lucky to get two. The local weather station came through, on and off, and as the little kids watched public access stuff, I sat and read on the saggy old couch. My older cousin had decided to read a magazine he'd brought, and the only break up over the muffled sounds of the TV was Grandpa as he carved his little figure. The sciff sciff sciff of Grandpa's whittling knife kept leading me away from the adventures of Frodo and Sam, and I found myself looking at him as he worked. If he was self-conscious about it, he never showed it. Grandpa wasn't so old that he seemed ancient, but even as a kid he seemed like some wise old elf to a sprat like me. \n\n\nAfter a while, I finally asked him what he was making, and his answer made me put my book down entirely.\n\n\n\"A totem.\"\n\n\n\"Like a tribal thing? Like in Robinson Caruso?\"\n\n\nHe smiled wetly at me, \"Kind of. This one is to keep something specific away though, something we may get a look at if we're very unlucky.\"\n\n\n\"What's that?\" my cousin asked, and I realized he had been listening too. The magazine lay across his lap now, and as Grandpa sat his knife aside, he lay it on the arm of the chair and moved over to sit closer. \n\n\nGrandpa had just opened his mouth to speak, when the lights suddenly went out, and the living room was left in semi-darkness. The power had struggled on manfully, but it had finally given up the ghost. The fire in the grate cast Grandpa in a ghostly pall, and I imagined that this was how his own Grandfather had looked when he told stories once upon a time. \n\n\n\"When I was young, younger than you two but right about little Mack's age there,\" he said, pointing at my brother, \"There was a blizzard much like this one. It blew in right after Christmas, and it stayed for five days. My brothers and I thought it was great, and we played in the snow as the adults looked on with concern. Did we have enough firewood? Did we have enough food? None of that mattered to us, though. Those were matters for adults and we threw snowballs and built forts and played until the sun set each day.\"\n\n\nThe fire crackled as the little kids moved closer to Grandpa, and we settled in for a story.\n\n\n\"As the blizzard went on, we noticed that something was stalking the woods around the cabin. It came on all fours, like a deer or a stag, but sometimes, if you were quick, you could see it on two legs as well. It never got close, not in the beginning, but as the blizzard went on, it crept closer and closer to the house. At night, my brothers and I would watch it from the attic window and sometimes its eyes were red as coals in the dark.\"\n\n\nWe were all gathered around him then, listening to the tale, enveloped in the mystery of the creature.\n\n\nMe and Jasper, especially, since I was pretty sure we had seen it yesterday.\n\n\n\"Every day, it got a little closer, and every day the storm got a little worse. My own Grandpa, a man who had seen the beginning of a new century, sat in a chair by the fire and whittled from the first day of the storm to the last. His old knife, this knife, actually,\" he said as he held up a fixed blade knife with a silver handle, \"was very sharp and the wood had fallen in thick curls as he worked. I was enthralled by the little carving he was making. I asked him what it was as more of it came out, and he told me it was a ward against things that might come with the storm. I watched him, studied him, and at night we watched the red eyes of the deer thing get closer and closer to the house. By the second night, the eyes might as well be right on the porch, and we shuddered in our blankets as we wondered what it was.\"\n\n\nThe storm outside made a perfect backdrop for the story, and we were so captured by the tale, that we didn't even hear my mother stepping in from the kitchen.\n\n\n\"On the last day, as the blizzard raged, we heard hoofbeats on the porch. My father wanted to go out and see what it was, but Grandpa said he would fix it. He told us to go into the attic, told my father and mother to go to their room, and took the thing he had carved out to the porch. There, as we tried to see through the window, we saw a bright light and the deer fell back into the snow. The deer, however, was wrong. Its legs were too long, its arms ended in strange hands, and its eyes were,\"\n\n\n\"Pop!\" My mother said, making all of us jump, \"I know you're not trying to keep these kids up all night with such tales?\"\n\n\nGrandpa had jumped a little too, so enthralled by his own story. He looked sheepish, like he had been caught doing something wrong, and shrugged as he gave another gummy smile. We all looked at her incredulously, as if not sure what to make of her, but if it made her self-conscious, she didn't budge.\n\n\n\"Just a little Christmas ghost story, Peg. I didn't mean any harm.\"\n\n\nMy mother gave him a hard look, “Well, if these boys are awake all night, shivering at the ghost of some story, you can sit up with them.”\n\n\nShe returned to the kitchen then, the smells of lunch still wafting from the wood stove she had in there.\n\n\n\"What was it?\" I asked Grandpa, keeping my voice low so mom wouldn’t hear, but he shook his head as he returned to his whittling.\n\n\n\"Better not say, boy. Don't want your mother to tell your Dad, and get myself thrown out in the snow like the leftovers,\" he said with a wink.\n\n\nHe tried to play it off as a joke, but I knew that Grandpa was always very aware that he was a guest in my parent's house. He lived with us for most of my young life, seeing me graduate high school before dying in his sleep one spring, but Mom told me once that it was a blessing to him to be so close to her and my dad and his grandkids.\n\n\nHer other siblings had moved away when they grew up, and Grandpa couldn't imagine himself living anywhere but in the woods he loved so much.\n\n\nAs night fell and my Dad and Uncle hadn't returned, Mom started getting worried. The town wasn't that far away and they should have been back well before now. She figured they had just gotten turned around, and maybe they would come stumbling in after dark, but as the dinner dishes were cleared away and we all prepared for bed, my mom and aunt became less sure.\n\n\nAs we watched through the window, seeing the red eyes that Grandpa had told us about, I heard them making plans to go look for them the next day. \n\n\n\"What do you reckon it is?\" my older cousin asked, the two of us watching the eyes as they moved fitfully through the trees that surrounded our cabin.\n\n\n\"Dunno,\" I admitted, \"I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\nAs my mom and aunt turned in and the lights that filtered through the boards went out, we settled in as well, still not sure what tomorrow would bring. \n\n\nDecember twenty-third dawned cold with still no sign of my Dad or Uncle. Mom was frantic, flitting around the kitchen like a hummingbird, and when she called us to the kitchen around noon, we all expected what was coming. She was dressed warmly, her two thickest coats thrown over a pair of snow pants, and the boots she had on were some of Dad's with several pairs of socks underneath.\n\n\n\"I'm going to town to see about your father. Until I get back, your Aunt is in charge. You boys listen to her, okay, and keep an eye on your Grandpa. He may need help, and if I'm not here to help him then it's up to you two. Be good, and be safe. If the phones come back on, call the Sheriff and tell him your father never came home. If I haven't made it to town, then someone will need to go out and look for us.\"\n\n\nShe left around eleven, lunch already on the table, and I watched her go from the front door as she disappeared into the snow. I hoped I would see her again, but after watching my Dad and Uncle disappear out there too, I wasn't sure I would. As I watched, I could also see the shadow of the creature as it stalked our little home. It was still on all fours, its antlers sometimes knocking snow from the trees, but sometimes when the wind would blow up I would see it rise onto its back legs for the briefest of moments before it was lost from sight. \n\n\nMom didn't come back for dinner, and as we went to bed I could hear my Aunt crying in the room she had shared with my Uncle.\n\n\nWe all woke up on the twenty-fourth, Christmas Eve, feeling hopeless and unsure of what to do. With every passing day, this felt less like a fun time and more like a real problem. My cousins and I started to feel like a bunch of westbound settlers who were watching the hills for Indians. My Aunt didn't get up to make us breakfast, and Ella said that she had fallen asleep in my brother's bed with an empty bottle by her head. It was probably the corn whiskey that Dad kept for emergencies, and I supposed this counted as one of those. We ate cold food from the fridge, Jasper making some eggs to go with it, and the two of us sat and watched the shadowy creature from the porch as we ate.\n\n\nMy brother and Ella had gone back to the attic, feeling like they might just go back to sleep, which is why they weren't there for what happened next. \n\n\nAs we sat munching on cold ham and burnt eggs, the creature stalked the house from the depths of the rising storm. The blizzard was focused, a swirling vortex that seemed to enclose us in a swirl of winter. We were powerless to do anything about it, so we just sat and watched as it raged and frothed. The creature was barely visible, an outline more often than not, and it seemed odd now that we weren't more worried about it.\n\n\nBoth of us had hunted deer, however, and the thought of being scared by a half-starved buck seemed silly. \n\n\nWhen it turned its horned head towards us, its eyes boring into our conversation as it stepped slowly towards the house, the idea no longer seemed so silly.\n\n\n\"What in the hell?\" my cousin said, rising so quickly that his stool went spilling over, \"What is that thing?\"\n\n\nIt had come out of the storm, and we could see that it was a solid white buck, its skin hanging on it like a carcass. Carcass was an apt word. The deer looked like a corpse, like some half-eaten piece of roadkill that had gotten up to seek revenge. Its antlers were huge, the tines many and majestic. It was a thirteen or fourteen-point buck by my quick count, but as I watched, the sharp bones seemed to move with an eerie independence from their host. They squirmed like a nest of snakes, and the creature reminded me of Medusa as it stood glowering at us. Its blazing eyes still glowed like coals, and it was baring its flat teeth at us like it meant to bite.\n\n\nI wished, suddenly, that I had my rifle, but it was in the room with my aunt and absolutely no use to me here. \n\n\nI don't think either of us was truly afraid until the creature stood up on its hind legs, legs that now seemed as boneless as the Gumby character my little brother liked to watch, and began to run at us.\n\n\nWe barely made it into the house, slamming the door behind us, when it hit the wood hard enough to shake it in the frame. Jasper and I went deeper into the house, but as I came to the ladder that led to the attic, I remembered that Grandpa was still in the living room. Mom's words echoed in my head, and I told him to go on and make sure the others were okay. \n\n\nHe nodded, understanding, and when I got to the living room, I found Grandpa still working on his totem.\n\n\n\"Grandpa, we've got to go,\" I told him, trying to help him up, \"This thing going to get us if we don't,\"\n\n\n\"I'm almost finished, kiddo. Once I'm done we'll be safe.\"\n\n\nI heard the door beginning to splinter, but Grandpa just shrugged me off as I tried to help him up.\n\n\n\"Grandpa, we need to get up into the attic. I've seen this thing, and I can tell you that your carving isn't going to,\" but I never finished.\n\n\nThe door burst open then, and the cadaverous deer creature came snorting into the living room. \n\n\nI was frozen in fear as it strode in, its hooves clicking on the floor, and I saw its front legs end in the same kind of snakey appendages that decorated its head. They were like fingers in some nightmare picture, and his red eyes focused on us as he came striding into the living room. His horns made a hellish noise as they scrapped the ceiling, sending curls of wood down in a shower. He was focused on Grandpa, his eyes boring into him, but as I started to bolt, Grandpa swept out an arm and held me back.\n\n\nI looked down and found that, to my surprise, the old man was smiling.\n\n\n\"Fancy meeting you again after all this time,\" Grandpa said, the deer snarling and snorting a mere fifteen feet away.\n\n\nHe started moving after a few tense seconds, and when Grandpa lifted his hand, I was momentarily blinded by a white-hot light that emanated from the carving there. I saw the face carved there for half a bitter second, the huge eyes and roaring mouth looking formidable, and then I had to throw my hands over my ears as my senses were assaulted by a sudden cry of primal rage. It was as if the totem was bellowing at the interloper, screaming down the deer thing that meant to kill me and grandpa, and all of my senses seemed assaulted at once. I was blind, deaf, smellless, unspeaking, and incapable of thought. I was as Adam must have been for the first few moments of his creation, and when I was able to gain my senses, I found myself lying on the floor as Grandpa looked on placidly.\n\n\nOf the deer, there was no sign, and Grandpa's totem looked as if it had been through the heart of a blazing inferno. The features were still perfect, only charged to a dumb muteness by the effort of expelling the deer thing. It had taken everything the little effigy had to set the creature aside, and now it was used up.\n\n\nGrandpa handed it to me, the carving leaving char stains on my fingers as it passed between us, \"Here, you might need to know how to carve one yourself someday.\" \n\n\nI started to thank him, but that was when I heard my father's angry yell as he asked just what the hell had happened to the door.\n\n\nSome of his anger was set aside when I came running up to hug him, and I could see both my Uncle and my Mother standing slightly behind him and looking concerned and confused.\n\n\nI tried my best to explain what had happened, but I don't think they believed me. Dad was skeptical that all this had happened in the few hours he had been gone, but Mom pointed out that he had been gone for at least a day and a half. That really threw him, and when he told her that he had just left this morning, she said he had been in the woods since at least the twenty-first.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed, \"This morning.\"\n\n\nThe two went back and forth, but when I told Mom that she had been in the woods overnight as well, she also looked confused. Both of them had been in the woods overnight, Dad had actually been in the woods for two nights, but both parties said the sun had never set. They had been roaming through the woods, looking for town, and had just appeared back here all of a sudden. When Dad had found Mom out in the woods, he assumed she had come looking for him. They had all three returned home, a trip that had taken less than a few minutes, and figured they had all just gotten turned around in the blizzard.\n\n\nSpeaking of the blizzard, it had stopped as suddenly as it had started.\n\n\nThe power came back on a little while later, and when my aunt woke up to find her husband had returned, we all took stock of the fridge and began working on one of the best Christmas Dinners ever. \n\n\nThat particular Christmas was one I will always remember, and not just because of the deer thing. \n\n\nWe had many more Christmases like it in the years to come, but none quite so tumultuous as that.\n\n\nI still live in that house, both my parents long dead, but every year we all get together and have Christmas like we used to.\n\n\nWe tell our kids, and Grandkids, about that Christmas we were snowed in, and I've been practicing my whittling since that day Grandpa sent the deer thing away in a blaze of light.\n\n\nI haven't seen one since, but who knows who might come to visit one snowy Christmas in Appalachia?"

        "selftext": "\nMel was having a cup of coffee at his favorite little spot one day when something would take place that he would never forget.\n\n\nHe was sitting at the bar area, people-watching as he often did, when an older man and his granddaughter walked in. The two were a study in contrasts, she a young waif so full of life and potential, he a stunted creature whose life was almost used up. His cane was barely audible over the general clamor, but Mel still heard the harsh chock chock chock as he walked across the tiled floor. The sight of him made Mel chuckle, though every step seemed to threaten to spill him to the floor. He held her hand in his wrinkly one and the girl beamed up at him with genuine love.\n\n\nThey were standing in line for a booth, the coffee shop was very busy, the girl gabled happily to herself as the old man leaned on his stick, taking it all in as if just happy to still be able to take in anything. Mel felt that his interest was becoming voyeuristic, but he just couldn’t look away from the pair. They were so different from the usual people who filtered into the shop, and it appeared he wasn’t alone. Two women had come in, and one of them had noticed the pair as well. Mel spent some time observing them as well, hoping to see the same interest or happiness that he had felt, but what he saw was very different.\n\n\nThe girl appeared to be filled with a mixture of trepidation, fear, and resolve that Mel had never seen before. Mel had felt like a voyeur, but the young woman was like a hawk whose seen a rabbit. She didn’t look away, seemed unself-conscious of her attention, and had eyes only for the little girl and her grandfather. The other said something to her, grabbing her arm fretfully, but she pulled away as she said something quick and harsh to her.\n\n\nAs they waited, the little girl suddenly noticed the pair and told the girl how pretty she looked.\n\n\nThe girl's attention was broken suddenly and she looked down at the little girl in surprise. She bent down on a knee, and Mel could see her point to the little girl's shirt and say something that made her giggle. Then she pointed to the old man, her lips asking if that was her Grandpa and the girl giggled as she answered that this was her papa as she clung to the man's hand. He turned to give the girls a slight nod and a smile before turning back to the barista as she arrived to seat them. \n\n\nThe two girls watched them go before seeming to decide to come to the bar where Mel was sitting instead of waiting for a booth too.\n\n\nAs they took a seat beside him, the one who had watched so intently was still staring at the pair. As the old man smiled happily at the young girl and the doll she was dancing across the table, the girl's face kept that same look of resolve. She clearly had something to do, something that she was loath to do but had to nonetheless. It was clear that it had something to do with the old man and his daughter.\n\n\n“They're quite the pair, aren't they?” Mel asked, making her jump as she blushed shyly, having been caught looking. \n\n\n“You have no idea,” she said, her accent strange and exotic.\n\n\nMel thought she might be from the Middle East or maybe Northern Europe. \n\n\nThe barista came around about that time and took her order and Mel couldn’t help but notice the resemblance. The two girls were quite dark complected, their hair long and black as it spilled down their backs, and as the one with the intense stare leaned in to whisper to the waitress, Mel saw the new girl look over at the pair sitting at the table. She nodded and brought the two girls coffees as she went to bustle in the kitchen.\n\n\n“Do you know them?” Mel, becoming very curious as the exchange went on.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, I do.” the girl told him, sipping her coffee.\n\n\nThe longer he looked at the girl, the more Mel suspected that she was foreign. This was Sweden, of course, and foreigners were not uncommon, but she also looked foreign in that way that people out of time look. The girl, as he thought of her, was likely in her mid-twenties, but her eyes led him to believe that she had lived more in those twenty years than Mel had in his thirty-seven. She had lived through terrible times, seen atrocities, and had come out on the other side.\n\n\nHe noticed movement from the table where the little girl sat with her father, and she squealed a little as a mountain of whipped cream and sprinkles was delivered atop some kind of chocolate confection. To the father went a far more sensible coffee and a scone, and Mel thought the old man might have made out better. The shop's scones were to die for, and less likely to put him into diabetic shock.\n\n\n“You probably just made that little girl's day,” Mel said off-handedly, guessing the woman had sent the order there.\n\n\nThe woman sighed, “I hope so. I would like to give her some joy on what may be the worst day of her life.” \n\n\nMel looked at her questioningly, but the woman had eyes only for the old man as he sipped and then added sugar to the coffee.\n\n\n“I met him in two thousand seven when I was twelve years old and I have spent the last seventeen years tracking him down. He has been my sole obsession, my reason for living, and every time I thought I might simply lie down and die, his face pushes me on.”\n\n\nShe stiffened a little as he looked down at the scone, but his granddaughter did something to steal his attention then and he looked away.\n\n\n“Must be a hell of a story,” Mel commented.\n\n\n“Would you like to hear it?” she asked, still not looking away from the old man, “It appears that we have some time.”\n\n\nMel wanted to decline, but instead simply nodded as he invited her to continue. \n\n\n“It all started when the Russian Army invaded our lands.”\n\n\nWhen she started talking, there was no way he could make her stop.\n\n\nOnce she got started, there was no way he would want her to.\n\n\nWhen I was little, we lived on a farm far from here.\n\n\nOur town was small, little more than a farming community, but we were happy. My family kept goats, sheep, chickens, cows, and horses. We made a living selling milk and eggs, wool and cheese, and our family was large. I had nine siblings, five boys and four girls, and we helped my mother and father with the daily chores and the running of the farm.\n\n\nSo, when the Russian Army pushed a little further, we became afraid.\n\n\nWe could see the smoke, we could hear the gunfire sometimes, and the Army was nowhere to be seen. The townspeople raised a militia, but it was no match for the might of the Red Army. They shot our young soldiers, our hunters, and ranchers, and marched into the town over the backs of the broken. We could see them from our farm, Father had not joined them, and we knew that the bad times would soon be upon us.\n\n\nShe paused, watching as the man took the scone in his hand before setting it down again.\n\n\nShe sighed, saying something in a language I didn’t know, before continuing.\n\n\nWe were all brought into the town the next day, some of us by force, and taken to the meeting hall in town so we could meet our new overseer. The mayor had stood with the men of the militia and been killed, and the man who stood on the stage was as different from the mayor as night was to day. The mayor was a big bear of a man, but he was kind to his friends and neighbors. This man, slight and wearing a military uniform, looked more like Father Christmas. He was an older man, his face a smiling mask that he showed us with great excitement.\n\n\nHis eyes, however, reflected none of the smile on his face. \n\n\nHe told us that his name was Major Krischer and that he would treat us as well as we treated him.\n\n\nThat turned out to be a lie.\n\n\nFor the first few weeks, all proceeded as normal. The soldiers and the Overseer toured the town, took in the farms, saw the market, and met the people. The man was courteous, but his sharp eyes missed nothing. The people thought that maybe the occupation would not be so bad. Perhaps he would be a kind overseer and when he moved on the town would still be as it always had been.\n\n\nThey could not have known how short a time that peace would be. \n\n\nIt began with simple theft.\n\n\nThe soldiers came to the farms and demanded that we give them a portion of our crops. Not much, they said, only an amount that came to around twenty-five percent of our total crop. Now, the mayor had always requested a third, so Father was excited that they wanted less. The mayor had already taken his share, however, and Father told the soldiers this. Taking more would cut into the food we had for winter, but the soldiers said they didn’t care. “You will give us what we ask for, or it will be taken,” they said, and thus we gave it to them.\n\n\nMy brothers, none of whom had gone to fight, became angry at this, but Father told them it would be okay.\n\n\n“It is not winter yet, and we will grow a little more before it comes.”\n\n\nNext came the conscriptions.\n\n\nThey told every male over the age of sixteen in the village that they would be conscripted into the red army. They would be trained, they would be paid, and they would be able to send money back to their families. Three of my brothers were of this age, and they were taken for training, despite their protests. My father continued to say that this was okay, that they would send money back, and that our lives might be better. Father had forbidden any of his children to join the militia, but it seemed the war would take his children nonetheless.\n\n\nMy older brothers left on a truck that day, and we never received money or letters or saw them ever again.\n\n\nMel began to worry about the direction of the story. He was expecting a heartwarming tale about someone helping a town in a time of strife. He had hoped that maybe the girl was repaying a kindness to the old man, but the longer the story went on, the less and less he thought it was so. Taking another look at the little girl who was dancing her doll around the sugary confection, Mel thought she looked different from the older man who sat across from her. Her hair was darker, her feature less harsh, but she was young and he was very old.\n\n\nWith so many of the men gone, next came the brutality. The soldiers didn’t need to tax anymore. They came and took what they wanted. Our cows, our chickens, our goats, our crops, and even a few of my sisters were taken in by soldiers and came back with bruises and tear-streaked faces. I was young, but I saw the looks they gave me as well. My father kept me home, not wanting me to go to the village, but when the food prices rose and our trade began to dwindle, Father found it hard to feed his remaining children. It was only myself, my younger sister Hetz, my older sisters, Grettle and Farra, and my older brother, Phillip. Mother and Father tried their best, but when the Overseer came to our farm one day, Father knew he couldn’t hide me any longer.\n\n\nHe came to the house, introduced himself as if we didn't already know who he was, and sat at my parent's table to discuss the reason for his visit. He insisted I be there, a girl barely thirteen, and I remember hating the way he looked at me. He said he had seen me in the market and wanted me to come to stay with him in his villa, saying he could give me a better life and offer me opportunities I wouldn't receive here. Father knew why he wanted me, we all did, but to my surprise, he agreed. He shook the man's hand and promised to send me to him the very next day. \n“Let us get her ready and we will bring her to your villa tomorrow,” he said and the Overseer was happy with this. \n\n\nHe left and Father got to work. He knew what it would mean if he defied this man, he had seen the stockades in the square, but he didn’t care. They had taken his oldest sons, his livelihood, and he would be damned if he would let them take his daughter too. Father loaded me into a grain wagon and had my siblings take me out of town.     \n\n\nAs we left, I peeked from the back and realized I could be seeing my home for the last time.\n\n\nI found it hard to be quiet as we went, and my crying must have attracted attention. Some soldiers stopped us and threatened to search the wagon. Farra was the oldest, Father had tasked her with keeping us safe, and when she offered to go off with the soldiers if they would let us pass, we knew we would never see her again. My brother Phillip took the reins and we left Farra behind. \n\n\nI never saw my parents again.\n\n\nI never saw my brothers again.\n\n\nWe kept moving until we came to a town where some cousins lived. They helped us and gave us shelter, but I never forgot that man or what he did to our village. We learned later that he took all he could from the land and left it a ruin. He hung my father and my mother and took Farra as his wife. He left us orphans, destitute, and I have never stopped thinking about that man. When I heard that he fled here to escape justice after being declared a war criminal, I knew our time for revenge had come.\n\n\nMel had been so focused on the story that he didn’t look back at the man until he started gagging. His hands were on his throat, his face puffing as he hacked, and the little girl was now asking him if he was okay with real fear in her voice. People were trying to help him, but in all the fuss only Mel saw the other girl, the one who’d come in with the storyteller, go to the girl and lead her away. \n\n\nThe little girl looked back only a single time, calling him Pappa before the two left.\n\n\nMel heard her get up, but before she left, the woman gave him a final detail.\n\n\n“The little girl is my niece, Farra’s child by this man who is old enough to be her grandfather. Farra died before he went into hiding, but when we heard that he had fled with a little girl, we knew what we had to do. I remembered one other thing when I was planning this. When he came to the house to ask my father to send me, he told my mother three things as she offered him tea and cakes. The first was that he took his coffee black, the second that he could not abide dairy, and the third was that he had a strong allergy to nuts.”\n\n\nShe smiled, dipping into a bow as the barista who had served the two told her it was time to go.\n\n\n“When you tell people how we killed one of Russia's monsters, tell them I killed him not with a gun, not with a sword, but with a scone that hid a handful of walnuts.”"

        "selftext": "The new guy walked into the kitchen looking like a lost puppy. He glanced around nervously like any one of us were going to jump out and attack him. “And this is the kitchen.” The grizzled voice of Dave, the owner, barely forced its way through the sounds of the kitchen. I couldn’t stand and watch them for long. We were neck deep in a rush and my screen was filling up by the second. I’m a fry cook at Dave’s Dive Bar. It’s a classic, crappy, little bar with neon signs peppering the small dining room walls. Behind the bar are shelves of cheap alcohol mostly used for shots; because Tommy, the bartender, couldn’t mix a cocktail if you stuck a gun in his face and demanded one. The tables looked like someone took their rage out on them with a hatchet, blowtorch, and whatever other object of destruction they could find.The only thing rougher than the tables, were the bars’ patrons. Most of them are bikers, drifters, or criminals of all shades. When the crowd gets rowdy enough they always end up stealing a street sign, which Dave proudly displays in the cramped hallway that leads to the graffitied bathrooms. It really helps lower your expectations so you won’t notice that they haven’t been cleaned for weeks. On the other side of the wall of cheap alcohol sits our cramped little kitchen; where I push out the greasiest food possible. With a fryer that I try to clean nightly but always seems to have dirty oil. There is also our flattop manned by Jose, and our broiler manned Nathan. We are the three musketeers that keep the customers’ bellies full so they can drink as much as possible.\n\n“This is your new fry cook Levi.” My thoughts were pulled from the bar back to the present. I turned to see the new guy and Dave standing behind me. The newbie was standing behind Dave like a child hiding behind one of their parents.\n\nI held out my hand and he stepped around the owner to shake it. He eyed the fryer as if the bubbling greasy would splash out and burn him. When I grasped his hand I made eye contact with him for the first time. He wore a Metallica t-shirt and blue jeans (we’ve never really had any kind of dress code). His hair was dirty blonde and his eyes were bluish gray and his face was clean shaven, that is if he could grow any facial hair at all. He was probably half a head taller than me but had so little presence that he might as well have been three feet smaller than me. “I’m Levi. Have you ever worked in a kitchen before?”\n\n“I’m Henry,” He said, glancing back again at the fryer like it was going to sneak up on him “and no, I have never worked in a restaurant before.” My eyes flicked over to Dave, but he was too busy staring off into space to notice my annoyed look. The fact of the matter is, strange shit happens at this bar, and Dave knows it. Most experienced cooks don’t last here. This kid, who is inexperienced and jumpy, seems like the exact opposite of long-term-employee material. I looked back at the kid and smiled as genuinely as I could. “Welcome to the team Henry.”\n\nFor a completely new cook, Henry didn’t do too bad. He was quick to catch on to a lot of stuff, and when he finally warmed up to us, he was pretty chatty. He was able to take the little bit of shit we threw at him and sometimes, he gave it right back. I was just thinking about how Henry was lucky that nothing weird happened when…*Ding.* An order came in. \n\nHenry and I looked up at the screen. Every station had a screen where table numbers, or customers’ names, would pop up with their orders. An order for “Davy J.” with fish sticks popped up on screen. My heart sank. Henry was about to go look for fish sticks to drop in the fryer when I grabbed him by the shoulder, “go hide in the walk-in Henry.” I looked over at Jose and Nathan and yelled, “I’ve got Davy J. on my screen cover for us.”\n\n“Wait. What’s going on? Who’s Davy? And why do we have to go to the walk-in?” I kept shoving him ignoring his questions. We didn’t have much time and we needed to hide. I opened the walk-in, shoved him in, and closed it behind us. “What’s going on Levi?”\n\nI put my hand on his mouth to shush him and whisper-screamed into his ear, “Shut it! I’ll explain everything in a minute.” I don’t know how much time had passed, but eventually there were three knocks on the walk-in door. I sighed loudly and felt my muscles relax. I opened the door and Nathan stood there. He looked exhausted and pale. I heard Henry pipe up over my shoulder.\n\n“What happened to you Nathan?” Nathan looked at him, then back to me, nodded and walked away. I turned to Henry and sighed.\n\n“Henry…that last order had fish sticks on it…do we have fish sticks?” I saw confusion flash across his face; which turned to him looking deep in thought; then finally, he realized.\n\n“No we don’t have them. So then why did the waiter or waitress…”\n\n“Just say server.” I cut into his train of thought.\n\n“Okay…Why did the *server* ring them up?” The sarcasm he added onto the word server irritated me a bit.\n\n“They didn’t. Every once in a while Davy J will appear on our screen. It will ask for a seafood dish that we don’t serve. When that happens, anyone who has it on their screen must go hide in the walk-in. No one rings it up, it just appears there.” Henry seemed to be processing what I was saying for a while. Then, he laughed\n\n“Oh I see. Nice try but I’m not so gullible.” His smug expression slowly changed to skepticism when he saw how serious I was. “What? You expect me to believe this? I know the new guy should expect to get pranked, but this is just obviously fake.”  \n “It’s not.” I thought I saw his armor of disbelief crack slightly with the piercing matter-of-fact way I responded.\n\n“Well what happens to the people who don’t hide?... Nathan looked really traumatized.”\n\n“I shook my head. You will most likely experience that in the next couple of weeks while I train you. He comes around every few weeks to torment us. When that happens, do what I say and everything will be fine.” I didn’t know if Henry was actually listening to me or just pretending to. Like I said, most people don’t last here. Many of them leave voluntarily. The rest of them? Well…they are in the news as a missing person case. I know what happened to a few of them. The other’s…I have my suspicions… \n\nThe rest of the night went off without a hitch. I hope to see Henry tomorrow. I could see him becoming a good addition to the team. But a part of me doesn’t want to see him again because I don’t want anything to happen to him."

        "selftext": " Pt 13- [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/16uwvkp\/trapped\\_in\\_the\\_dollar\\_general\\_beyond\\_pt\\_13\\_the\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/16uwvkp\/trapped_in_the_dollar_general_beyond_pt_13_the\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\nIt turned out that I was in for more than one surprise when I made it back into the Dollar General Beyond.\n\n\nCelene took me from the store where we had met to another store that I supposed would’ve been her staging area. \n\n\nIt was not a store that I had been to before, and it almost seemed like these pocket stores were off the beaten path somehow. It made me question why I had never run into Gale’s store before he took me there. Why had I never run into another person before the hermit? These things made me wonder how many people were somehow tucked away, and how many Dollar Generals were outside of my path and would never be encountered until I realized they existed at all.\n\n\nAs expected, the damage to my clothes and my body was fixed, but it was something beyond that too. I suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to use the bathroom, and my stomach felt full in a way that it hadn’t since I left. I had never really stopped to think about it before, since I have been swapping stores so often, but I was never hungry when I came to a new store. I had eaten an hour before leaving work on the night I had stepped into the bathroom. What if it was more than just my clothes and my health that were regenerated? What if each new step set me back to the way I was the second that I stepped through?\n\n\nIt was definitely something I would have to think about later, but the idea was put out of my mind at that moment as a cold nose hit me in the hand.\n\n\nI reached down without thinking about it, scratching the fluffy fella on the head, and that’s when I realized Celene wasn’t the only lost soul that I had stumbled upon. The panting border collie was black and white with a big brown spot on his chest. He must be the dog from the posters in the break room, the one that somebody was looking for, the one that Celene had talked about in her journal, the one that had traveled the multiple stores as readily as we had. The dog seemed happy to see a new face, and as it woofed and danced around happily, I was just glad for the comfort that came from petting a dog again. It was strange what you missed while you were traversing the infinite sphere of Dollar Generals, and this was certainly one of those things.\n\n\n“Give him a minute to breathe, Buddy,” Celene said as she good-naturedly pushed the dog back a little, “Sorry about that. He doesn’t meet many new people.”\n\n\n“It’s OK,” I responded, “ I haven’t seen many new people myself lately, especially of the four-legged variety.”\n\n\nShe invited me to sit by her makeshift campfire, which turned out to be a gas burner with some cooking equipment on top of it, and as Buddy put his head in my lap, she seemed to dissect me with her eyes.\n\n\n“This isn’t your first time traveling is it”\n\n\n“Not even close,” I told her.\n\n\n“I didn’t think it was. You don’t seem particularly freaked out by the fact that your wound healed or that you’re inside a Dollar General store. How long have you been traveling?”\n\n\n“I don’t know,” I answered her honestly, “ I got here less than a year ago, I think, and after a while, I just started moving through the stores. It’s been a wild ride, but I’ve seen some pretty outrageous things while I’ve been trying to figure out how to get out.”\n\n\nCelene put some stew in a pot over the fire, flipping the burner on as she stirred it around, “ I’m not convinced there is an out. I’ve seen people go out the front door, and I’ve seen people go into the ceiling, but I’ve never heard of anybody making it to the end of the loop, at least they never came back to talk about it if they did.”\n\n\n“Yeah, I know. I read your journal, and that made it pretty clear that,”\n\n\nCelene looked up, the dripping wooden spoon in her hand looking more like a weapon than a utensil, and I was worried for a minute that she might attack me.\n\n\n“You read my journal? And how exactly do you know that it’s my journal?”\n\n\nAs if an answer, I reached into my bag and pulled out her battered old journal, opening it to the place where her name tag was.\n\n\n“I feel pretty certain that there’s probably only one Celene trapped inside of here. I found this on an old guy in a derelict store just before Gale and I were forced to kill him. I got the feeling you hadn’t just handed it to him, so I figured I’d hang onto it. I felt pretty confident I’d run into you at some point or another, or you would run into my corpse at some point or another.”\n\n\nCelene looked like she wanted to reach out and take the journal, but she seemed unable with her hands shaking the way they were.\n\n\n“You’ve met Gale?” \n\n\n“Yeah, we were traveling together until he decided to go into the ceiling.”\n\n\nCelene looked gobsmacked, “Why would he do that?”\n\n\n“I think he felt guilty about killing the old hermit. He seemed to be taking it very hard before he left for good, and now I’m wondering if I’ll ever see him again?”\n\n\nCelene poked at the food and seemed to think about what she was going to say next. Buddy whined, poking his nose against my hand as if trying to draw my attention away from Celene. He was an intuitive creature, Buddy, and it likely came from being with Celene for so long. He wanted to give her a chance to mull over the myriad of feelings she likely had banging around in there. I already suspected she had some connection to the hermit as well as Gale, and I couldn’t imagine how she was feeling now that she knew they were likely both dead. \n\n\n“I wouldn’t count on it.” she finally said, “Nothing ever comes out of the ceiling except the miasma. I’ve never seen anything else come out at least.”\n\n\nShe took the journal, setting it beside her chair and she stirred the soup.\n\n\n“Of course, I’d never seen anything come from the outside either, so my information might not be as reliable as I thought.”\n\n\nShe ladled some of the stew into a bowl and handed it to me, picking up a second and spooning some up for herself.\n\n\n“So, what happens now?” I asked, taking a hesitant bit of the hot slop.\n\n\n“Now, we eat some dinner. The soup is definitely the kind you want to eat hot so you,”\n\n\n“No, I mean like in general. What do we do now?”\n\n\nCeline laughed, “I have no clue, kid. Like I said, no one‘s ever come out of the outside before, just like they’ve never come out of the ceiling before. You’re a first for me.”\n\n\nI laughed a little, her candor breaking the tension, and we proceeded from there.\n\n\nThat first night, we mostly made small talk and ate stew. It was pretty clear that Celene hadn’t had anyone to talk to but Buddy for quite some time. She seemed almost shy around me like she thought if she spoke her mind I might disappear. It made our conversation stilted at first, but not for very long. Being stuck outside for several weeks, coupled with the almost magical way I had just healed the damage to my back, meant that after I had a belly full of soup and a warm place to crash I fell asleep in pretty short order.\n\n\nOne minute I was drinking soup and laughing at something she was saying, and the next minute I was waking up with Buddy snuggled up beside me and an empty chair across from me.\n\n\nI was worried that I had been abandoned again, but it didn’t last long.\n\n\nI heard a noise and looked up to see her securing something against the bathroom door, Celene looking up as she noticed I was awake.\n\n\nShe had been out getting supplies, and she had several plastic bags full of soups meat, and other amenities. Buddy, who had also been asleep, wiggled around to look at her and barked as he got up and danced around his mistress. Celene smiled, reaching into the bag as she tossed him a beggin strip from the depths of the plastic pack. Buddy took it to the dog bed that sat beside our sitting area and began crunching on it viciously.\n\n\n“Sorry,” she said, clearly seeing something on my face “ I should’ve left a note or something. It’s been a while since I’ve had anyone here but myself and buddy, and leaving communication on when I’ll be back isn’t something I’m used to doing.”\n\n\nI told her it was fine, and I went to go help with the bags as she restocked her coolers. It appeared, like Gale, she believed in keeping a stocked larder for whatever might come, and she would get no complaints out of me in that regard. Buddy panted happily as he tried his best to help, and we ended up scratching his head as the two of us finished up and moved back to the cook stove.\n\n\n“So where did you find him?” I asked, scratching the dog as he leaned into my pets.\n\n\n“I found him again a few months ago when I was traveling. You read my journal so you know I’ve been pretty far into the stores. Buddy here was lying in a store that looked like a meadow and I was afraid he was dead at first. He was so still that when he lifted his head and whined at me, it startled me. He was hungry and I doubt he had eaten anything in a while. I fed him, and after some coaxing, he let me pick him up and came back here with me. He’s a good fella, but I’ve had to go looking for him more than once since I brought him here to my base camp. I finally started propping the bathroom door closed, but after the last time, when he found himself in the cave store, I don’t think he’s in a big hurry to leave again.”\n\n\nI nodded, realizing I was in the presence of two talented explorers.\n\n\n“Something I wondered about when I found it was how the hermit got your journal?” I asked, accepting another bowl of stew from my hostess, “Did he steal it?”\n\n\nCelene looked into the butane flames for a long moment before answering and she looked a little sad, “No, Jasper didn’t need to steal it. I was taking care of him until very recently, helping him get his mind right so he could come back here, or so I thought.”\n\n\n“Were you the one who taught him to travel?” I asked, trying not to sound accusatory.\n\n\n“I did,” she said, taping a bite of her stew, “But when I found him he was in no shape to travel at all. He had been stuck in that store for a while, his mental health deteriorating as his mind eroded. I found the pill bottle while exploring his filthy little home, and guessed that being back on his medication might help him get his mind right. So I went to a store I knew of and found a refill of his prescription. He didn’t want to take them at first, he didn’t trust me and thought I might be trying to poison him, but as I brought him food and supplies, he began to figure out that I wanted to help him. Eventually, I convinced him that the pills would make him feel better, and as he took them, he became more like his old self. We talked and he told me about his grandson, what he could remember at least, and asked me to help him look for him. His mind was still a mess and he wouldn’t go near the bathroom for anything. He was scared, terrified by what he had seen at the end of his travels, and asked me if I would search for Jacob and bring him back.”\n\n\n“I’m guessing you didn’t find him.” \n\n\n“Nope, and I’ve spent quite a while looking. I never found a trace of him anywhere. It’s like the poor kid just evaporated, or maybe got taken by the miasma. Hell, maybe he went outside for all I know, but I came back after some time and Jasper was completely gone. The pills weren’t helping anymore, the traveling wasn’t helping anymore, and when I came back with a stronger dose of his medication, he attacked me. I lost my bag in the scuffle, but I considered it an even trade for making it away. I never went back, never went to check on him again, and I avoided his store at all costs.”\n\n\nThat was about the time I decided to change the subject and we spent to rest of the evening talking about different stores. Celene had been keeping a journal as well about different types of Dollar General stores, and she was fascinated by all the ones I had seen. She had seen many of the same stores, but some were a mystery to her. She looked over my journal, making some notes in a small pad she kept on her, and I did the same with hers, making notes on the “later” stores. I still believed that these would be the stores I would encounter before I made it out, and I wanted to be prepared.\n\n\n“This is extremely well done,” she said after a while, “you’ve got a real talent for this.”\n\n\n“Thank you,” I said, glad to have found someone who appreciated my work, “It’s not as extensive as yours, though. I’d really like to see some of these other stores you talk about.”\n\n\n“You will,” she said, “Everyone sees them eventually. You can only stay still in this place for a certain amount of time before you feel like you have to travel, to move, and sometimes I wonder if that's what made Jasper so crazy. Maybe he let his fear keep him in that store for too long and it drove him even crazier than he already was.”\n\n\nI had no clue, but as Buddy snored happily against my leg, I felt a yawn creep up my throat as my own exhaustion threatened me again.\n\n\nCelene smiled, “Get some sleep, kid. There will be plenty of time for studying and talking and a lot of other stuff tomorrow. You’re safe now, you made it out of the outside, and that's something I don’t think anyone else has ever managed to do.”\n\n\nI drifted off not long after that, but my dreams were far from placid.\n\n\nThat was the night I dreamed about Gale, and it was a dream that would ultimately pull me into a place more dangerous than the Outside."

Park may be too grand a word for it, but that's what Dale always called it. In reality, it was a big plastic play structure with a couple of slides, a climbing wall, and sandpit. The whole thing is surrounded by a fifteen-by-fifteen fence with a couple of benches for the parents to sit on. That's where I was that day, scrolling through Reddit and finishing my cigarette. Dale was playing with a couple of neighborhood kids, their parents sitting on other benches, so they didn't have to breathe my smoke. I looked up in time to see them go beneath the play structure into an area they call The Cave.\n\nThe cave is an enclosed area beneath the structure, with a roof that was comfortably close for a kid and downright claustrophobic for an adult.\n\nI heard my phone chirp looked back down to see a text from my wife. She'd just gotten home from work and wanted Dale and me to come home to help with groceries. So, I pitched my cigarette over the fence and called for Dale.\n\n\"Come on, Dale. Mum wants us home.\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Come on, Dale. If you can't listen, we won't be able to come back tomorrow.\"\n\nUsually, this would have brought him running; playing outside was his favorite pastime, but there was still no answer.\n\nBoth of his playmates came out the other side then, giggling and laughing as they acted out whatever game they were playing, and I asked them where Dale had gone.\n\nAlicia, a dark-haired girl who was missing her front teeth, lisped, \"'eeth thtill in the cave, Mithter Daweth.\"\n\nSo, I hunkered my nearly six-foot frame down, looked into the dark underbelly of the play structure, and called for Dale to come on out.\n\n\"Come on, Dale. We really have to go. Mum's waiting on us.\"\n\nI still didn't think anything was amiss other than Dale trying to squeeze in a few more minutes of playtime. I expected him to giggle and poke his head out, baiting me into chasing him or crawling into the cave. He knew that as big as I was, it would be funny to watch me try to get under the structure to run him out, and this was a game we played often.\n\nInstead, there was only silence.\n\nSo, I sighed and hunkered down on the damp sand to crawl under and get him. I heard the other two parents chuckle as they watched me, my back scraping at the bottom of the structure as I crawled towards the entrance to the cave. I didn't mind playing with Dale, but this was a little much. I was tired from my night shift the day before, and my back was sore from lifting freight all night. I resigned myself to having a stern talk with Dale on the way home about not listening and crawled into the dark opening of The Cave.\n\nAs I passed from the lighted world outside, the afternoon sun cutting slants across my face through the boards of the structure as I entered the blackness of the cave. I felt a crawling sensation on my neck. I thought I might have picked up a spider and ran a hand over the spot to knock him off. There was nothing there, but the feeling wouldn't abate. It felt like my hackles were up, that ancient feeling of a predator nearby putting me on edge, and it took everything I had to keep dragging myself through the space. It was only about five feet of blackness, the space preternaturally dark, but it was the weirdest I had felt in years. Was it always this dark here? I had crawled through here before, but I didn't remember it being this black. Worse still, I didn't feel like I was alone in here. Of course I'm not, I reminded myself. I came in here to get Dale. As I crawled, though, I began to doubt that my son was still in here and the sense that something else lived here wouldn't be easily put aside.\n\nI felt like something hateful lived here, something that was even now hungry and slobbering.\n\nMy goal went from getting Dale to getting out of the space, and I came out the other side, expecting to be dragged back in and consumed.\n\nI stood up, wiping dirt off my knees, as the air puffed out of me loudly.\n\nIt could have easily been mistaken for exertion, but I'd be a fool to pretend it as anything but fear.\n\nI expected my son to pop out and laugh at his silly old dad then, but he was still nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Dale?\" I called, my voice becoming fearful after what I had experienced, \"DALE?\"\n\nThe other parents looked up, hearing the jagged quality of my voice, and rose up to see if everything was okay.\n\n\"I can't find my son,\" I told them, and they told me not to panic as we searched the play structure. \n\nMy wife came walking up just as I started getting frantic, and she must have sensed my concern as she caught sight of me. \n\nShe called the police then, and as I ran to check the woods, I heard her say that hateful phrase for the first time.\n\n\"Our son has gone missing. Please send help.\"\n\nThirty minutes later, two cars pulled up, and a couple of officers came to render assistance. \n\nI had searched behind the flats, in the scraggy woods nearby, around the little retention pond that I always tried to keep Dale away from, and was just about to start knocking on doors when I saw them. They wanted to talk to me, me being the last to see Dale, and the officer in charge sent two of his men to check nearby houses as they asked me questions for the next few minutes. Where had I seen him? What was he wearing? Was there anyone suspicious around? Who were his mates? Where might he go if he'd left? Did he run away often? And all the time, they assured me they would find him and not to panic.\n\nI answered their questions honestly but knew he couldn't have left the play park.\n\nDale was small for his age, I told them so, and despite all my misgivings with the flats we lived in, they had done one thing I thanked them for. The clasp on the gate was too heavy for a little tyke to push open. Dale had struggled with it before, and I knew he couldn't have left without help. The other parents said they hadn't seen him come out or seen anyone lurking around the playpark that day. \n\nSo, the police searched. They searched the play park, the surrounding flats, the woods, and the whole area, basically retreading the ground I had already walked. As night began to fall, they called in more officers to begin canvasing wider. My wife and I were distraught, Dale was our first and only child, but as the days stretched on, it seemed less and less likely that they would find him.\n\nI'm not ashamed to say that I took Dale's disappearance poorly.\n\nMy wife was stoic through it all, but I knew she was hurting too. He was her baby, she had carried him for nine months, but I think she held a lot of her sorrow in because she saw me floundering. I became like a ghost in my own home. Eventually, I went back to work, but my performance suffered. It only takes a little effort to load things onto a truck, but I was falling behind, missing quotas, and making trucks late. The supervisor was a mate from primary school, fortunately, and he saw that I was not doing well. He suggested counseling and told me it might help me, but I didn't want to tell some stranger about my problems.\n\nA year passed, my wife and I growing distant as the days went by, and as the anniversary of Dale's disappearance drew closer, I finally really screwed things up at work.\n\nI can't even say it wasn't my fault because it absolutely was. I was operating a lift, something I had done since I got certified at nineteen, and as I backed out with a load, I hit a riser. It wasn't a bad hit, just a bump, really, but the legs on that particular riser, as it turned out, were getting ready to give way. The riser collapsed in spectacular fashion, and when it fell, it fell on one of my coworkers. He lived. They managed to get the pallets off him before they crushed him, but it broke his collarbone, and he had to be hospitalized.\n\nMy supervisor was furious, but I could tell he was trying to hold back in the face of my sincere grief.\n\n\"I'm recommending you for two weeks of unpaid leave. If it were anyone else, I'd hand them their walking papers here and now, but I know you need help more than you need a trip to unemployment. Take these two weeks, sort your life out, and return to work. If this happens again, mate, I ain't gonna have a choice.\"\n\nI couldn't look at him. His pity was worse than his anger, and I knew I needed to do something. I nodded, mumbling a thank you, and he showed me out of his office. I walked around for the rest of the night, trying to figure out what I was going to tell my wife and finding nothing. She would be mad, probably mad enough to finally leave me, but as the sun started peeking over the horizon, I knew there wasn't much else I could do.\n\nShe was just as mad as I thought she'd be, but her pity was just as hard to look at as my supervisors had been. \n\n\"He's gone. Dale is gone, and making yourself a martyr over it won't change the fact. You still have insurance. Go get some counseling, and figure this out. I need you back. Not just back at work, but back HERE. I miss him too, but digging into those wounds won't make it better. Get some help, for both our sakes.\"\n\nThere was something unsaid beneath that statement, and I understood it but wasn't sure what to do about it.\n\nI spent the next four days in a blackout state. I had found my therapy at the bottom of a bottle, something I had avoided up to that point. With no job to go to, I just stayed home and drank my pain away. The wife's patients finally ran thin. After two days of watching me hunker on the couch like a sot, she told me she was going to see her mother for a few days and suggested I sort myself out while she was gone.\n\n\"If I come home and you're still like this, I can't promise I'll be back for long.\"\n\nOnce she was gone, I spent most of my days in a fermented haze.\n\nThat's how, on the fifth day, I found myself buzzed and sitting on the same bench I had been on when I told Dale we needed to leave.\n\nIt was early afternoon, and the playpark was empty, thankfully. It wasn't the first time I had just come to sit here, and the other parents often found excuses to leave with their kids when I came to wallow in my grief. I was the sad father who came back to the place he'd suffered most, and I really hoped the park had been empty when I got here. Even in my current state, I didn't want anyone to see me like this. It was embarrassing, and it might frighten some of the children if I came weaving into the park smelling like a distillery. I was staring at the play structure, thinking to myself that it might be time to get some help when I first saw it. \n\nIt was just eight words, but those words sobered me up faster than any cold shower could.\n\nOn the side of one of the slides, in rough marker, someone had written, ***\"Where have you gone, Daddy? I miss you***.\"\n\nI just sat there, staring for what felt like an eternity, and as the tears came, the alcohol came up as well.\n\nMy tears fell nakedly into the pile of sick that sat between my legs, but as the rage bubbled up, it felt like they were almost burned away.\n\nSomeone was mocking me, mocking my son's loss, and as I staggered towards the supers officer, I was madder than I had any right to be.\n\nMr. Vinders, the super for the complex, always reminded me of one of the Hobbits from the Lord of the Rings. He was short, fat, had a curly brown ring of hair around the bald spot on his crown that got bigger every year, and when he sat at his desk, it was like a child sitting in his fathers chair. He nearly fell out of that chair when I slammed the door to his office open, and his expression of confused anger became one of confused fear as he looked at my face. \n\nHe was a small man, and the sight of a large, angry drunk in his office reminded him of his stature rather quickly.\n\n\"Someone has written hateful graffiti on your play park slide, and I want to know what you intend to do about it?\"\n\nHe took a minute or two to collect his thoughts before asking what the hell I was talking about?\n\nI took him out to look at it, leading him to the slide in question, and he looked taken aback as he read the words.\n\n\"Who would do such a thing?\" he asked, more to himself than anyone.\n\nThe way he side-eyed me, I could tell that he thought I might have done it, but one look at my face made him rethink it before he said it.\n\n\"I'll take care of this immediately, Mr. Dawes. In the meantime, why don't you go home and rest? You seem to be under the weather.\"\n\nHe had the decency not to call me a drunk out in the open, and I conceded the matter as I went home to sober up a little.\n\nAs night began to fall some undetermined amount of time later, I sat up from the couch and listened to the five of six stout cans rattle angrily to the floor.\n\nBy the headache and the mealy taste in my mouth, I had not gone home and sobered up.\n\nAs I moved into the kitchen to make something for dinner, I remembered the words on the slide and felt angry all over again. As the meat pie I had taken from the freezer spun in the microwave, I wondered if Vinder had taken care of it like he said? I wondered if he would paint over it or wash it off or how would he do it? Were the words still sitting there on that slide?\n\nAs the microwave *dinged,* I resolved to go find out and took my pie and plastic fork on a little field trip.\n\nI watched the steam roll off the top as I walked down to the little park, the night air alive with crickets and night birds. It would have been a pretty evening if I hadn't been so in my despair. The trees were losing their autumn leaves, becoming bare and skeletal, and the air was crisp enough to make my undershirt unadvisable. My bare feet slapped at the concrete as I walked away from my flat, and the closer I got, the better the view of the offending slide. The words were gone, the pressure washer having left the slide a little lighter for its efforts, but as I came through the gate, I saw that something else had been added to the side of the structure. It looked like the same marker strokes, the handwriting big and childish, and as I read it, I felt a growl rumble in my throat.\n\n***\"I saw you today, Daddy. I saw you, but you didn't see me.\"***\n\nI looked around as the wind rattled the nearby trees, expecting to see a group of snickering youths as they watched me. This had teenagers written all over it, and as the pie slipped out of my hand, I loosed my shout to the sky. Why? Why did they devil me like this? Was this a game to them? When I was a kid, we would have never thought of doing something like this to anyone, let alone a grieving father. The dark offered up no answers, but the side of the playpark did when I turned back. \n\nBeneath the first message, another smaller message was written in the same childish scrawl.\n\nThe longer I looked at it, the more I recognized it.\n\nHow many times had I watched my son scribble words in his reader just that way, filling in the workbook pages in big looping script as he prepared to go to kindergarten?\n\n***\"Daddy? I can see you, but you can't see me. Please help me. It's scary here.\"***\n\nI hunkered on my knees in the sand, looking at the words as I ran my fingers over them. They looked just like his, and as I felt a splinter catch in the pad of tmy thumb, I pulled it back sharply. There was no way he could be here. There was no way he could have been hiding here for a year, but as I watched the play set, I had no doubt that he had written those words.\n\n\"Dale?\" I said, my voice quavering as I glanced into the shadowy depths of the playground, \"DALE?\" I shouted a little louder, casting around as I tried to find him.\n\nI walked around to the other side, stumbling in the gritty sand as it sucked at my feet. My head was full of rails, and my words slurred even to my own ears. There were doubtlessly people looking through their curtains at me as I capered like a sot drunk, but I didn't care. My boy was here, he was here somewhere, and I needed to find him. \n\nI tripped then, going face down in the sand, and when I came up, I saw a new message on the wet-looking plastiwood. It was hard to see in the shadow that it sat in, but as I got close, I put my trembling fingers on it to make sure it was real. My fingers came away tacky, the tips black as if they had touched wet marker. \n\n***\"I need you to come get me, Daddy. I'm stuck in the Sad Swamp, and I need help.\"***\n\n\"'scuse me, sir? Everything alright, there?\"\n\nAs their flashlights hit me, I squinted, but the words were like a brand across my eyes.\n\nThe sad swamps were what Dale called the Swamps of Sadness from his favorite movie, The Never Ending Story. We had watched it about a thousand times, and when the VHS I had owned as a kid finally broke in the VCR, we had searched for it on DVD until we found it at the local thrift store. He watched it every day before his afternoon nap, and I imagined he could just about quote it word for word. Seeing the word Sad Swamps made me certain it was Dale talking, but how? How could he be talking to me from…\n\nThe light was right in my face now, and I put up a hand to block it out.\n\n\"Some of your neighbors were worried you were faring poorly, Mr. Dawes. They heard you shouting and wanted us to check on you.\"    \n\nThey were being kind. It seemed that everyone was being \"kind\" these days to poor ole drunk Mr. Dawes, but I didn't have time for them. I had seen something under the edge of the play structure, half a word that was buried in shadows. It was his latest message, and as I staggered towards it a little, I hoped it would tell me how to get him back.\n\n\"What happened?\" one of them asked in his tone jovial as he leaned down, \"Wife lock you out after you came home snookered? Well, we can get you a place to sleep it off, sir, never,\" he had put a hand on my shoulder, but I pulled away from him as I tried to see the words that were beneath the structure. It was just six words, but I couldn't see the last one, and the last one seemed the most important.\n\nThe police grabbed hold of me, but I fought to get away as I tried to see that last word.\n\nI got as close as I could, both catching me under an arm as they pulled me away from the structure and finally saw it.\n\nI repeated it again and again as they put me in the back of the car, all the fight out of me now, wanting to commit it to memory before my drink-addled brain made a muck of it. \n\n\"We'll phone the misses and let her know she can come pick you up in the tank, Mr. Dawes. If she don't wanna, then I guess you're sobering up on a bench for the night, s'long as you don't try any more of that.\"\n\nI ignored them as we left the parking lot, my flat disappearing behind us as I repeated those six words like a mantra.\n\n***Look for me inside the cave.***\n\nThe police hadn't been wrong; my wife was livid.\n\nShe came down to the station, her clothes clearly thrown on hastily, and glowered at me through the bars of the holding cell. It was just me in there with a few old gaffers, and they were snoring in a corner as I slouched on the bench. I was still imprinting those words into my brain, mumbling them like a magic spell, when I heard her voice and looked up into her scowling face.\n\n\"I can't believe you've done this. It isn't enough that you get sent home from work, that you do nothing but blunder around like an old tramp, and won't get any help to get yourself out of this rut, but now you go and get yourself tossed in the drunk tank. I'm done, Malcomn. Do you understand me? This is the last straw. I won't stay here and watch you destroy yourself.\"\n\n\"He's alive,\" I rasped out, and when she looked at me, I saw all the anger leak out of her, only to be replaced with pity.\n\n\"I miss him just as much as you do, but you have to let him go. It's been a year, Malcolm. He's not coming home. It wasn't your fault what happened to him, and you have to stop blaming yourself for it.\"\n\n\"He's been leaving me messages at the play park, Stephanie. I can prove it. Come with me, and I'll show you. We can find him, we can be a family again, we can,\" but she cut me off with the first sob I heard from her in months.\n\n\"I'm leaving, Malcolm. When they release you in the morning, don't call me. Go back to the flat, go to your mother's house, go to hell for all I care. I can't watch you do this anymore.\"\n\nShe left me there with the other drunks, but I had already decided what I had to do.\n\nThey turned me loose in the morning, and after a brisk walk home, I got the things I'd need. I brought a torch, some string, and a big hunting knife I'd had since I was a teenager and set off for the play park. It was early morning, and I had the place to myself, save for the pigeons still gobbling at my spilled pie's remains. I didn't see any new graffiti, but I didn't need any. I knew where Dale was, and as I got on my hands and knees, I crawled under the playground and into the cave.\n\nEven in my assuredness, I felt foolish as I moved into the cave. It was dark, but I could still see the light streaming in from the other end. I didn't feel that same sense of foreboding like I had before, no sense of a monster coming to gobble me up, and I turned on the torch as I checked out the corners. The cave was a box of four walls with a roof of thick plastic overhead, and I should have been able to see all four walls. Three of the walls were normal enough, but as I looked to the west-facing wall, I was aware of another opening that led into a space that shouldn't exist.\n\nAn opening between that led into deeper darkness.\n\nAs my torch burned against that encroaching blackness, I turned my body in a ponderous circle and started crawling into it. \n\nIf I meant to get my son back, I would need to hobble into the Sad Swamp and come out the other side.\n\nIn contrast to the \"dark cave\" behind me, the space I entered was pitch black. The edges of my light curled oddly, the darkness seeming to retract like felt as I moved deeper. I wasn't underground, I was still heading forward, but given the dimensions of the play structure, the place I crawled shouldn't exist. The length was wrong. The longer I crawled, the more I expected to wake up and find that I had fallen asleep in the drunk tank. The space was crammed but felt vast as it stretched on. It was like an underground cave, the claustrophobic passages threatening to collapse in on you at any minute.\n\nBesides being black dark, it was also utterly silent. Besides the crunch of my knees, as they moved over the sand, no other sound seemed to exist. My own labored breathing seemed to be absorbed by the thick midnight around me, and every painful drag of my body sent a spasm of need through me. It was a primal need, a need to stand at my full height and stretch my arms up high to dissipate the confining gloom that hung around me. The same part of my brain made it pretty clear, however, how bad an idea that would be. \n\nWhat if my hand should pass into that darkness and never return? \n\nWhat if the darkness came back with the hand?   \n\nI kept crawling into that inky soup, wondering if I would simply wander here forever? It was pitch outside the protective beam of my torch, and with every struggling shuffle, I wondered why I didn't turn out and go back? Nothing could survive down here. Nothing could live in this pitch blackness. If I didn't go back now, I'd never find my way and be forced to wander endlessly in this void until my torch went out and then what? \n\nI knew I wasn't alone when I heard the soft scuff of feet on sand. I looked into the black expanse, expecting to see the beast that had terrified me the last time and finding nothing. The beam of my torch didn't go very far, but at the end of the light, I could hear the scuff of bare feet on sand. Something was coming towards me, and I wasn't sure what I was hoping to find. Would it be my son, or would it be a monster to end my journey?\n\nWhen a dirty, half-starved little boy buried me in a hug that circled my shoulders, I knew I'd found him.\n\n\"Dale?\" I whispered, but he could only nod and cry against me.\n\nI didn't waste time or breath; I just scooped him up and didn't stop moving until I was back in the lighted world of the playpark.\n\nAs we moved, I could feel that clawing, penetrating glare from behind me. Something had noticed I was taking their prize, and they were unhappy. I kept crawling, kept pulling, but I could hear those scrabbling feet as they kicked up sand. They were getting closer now, their growl loud and thunderous, and on a whim, I turned my torch on them.\n\nBathed in the light, they yelped wildly and kicked up sand as they back peddled.\n\nI didn't dare look to see what had been tailing me. I put on a burst of speed, crawling like our lives depended on it, and when I collapsed in the light of day, I was aware of people shouting at me to get out of there. Their kids were asking who I was and why I was so dirty, and they must have thought I was a bum. When they saw Dale, they tried to take him from me, but I held on like my life depended on it, and when they finally recognized us, I heard their anger turn to surprise.\n\nThey took us both to the hospital, and I'm glad to say that aside from being underfed and very dirty, Dale was completely fine.\n\nMy wife came to the hospital, and we both cried as she apologized for doubting me. \n\nI refused it, telling her she had nothing to apologize for.\n\n\"I doubted myself. I fell into the bottle and nearly lost myself in my grief. I should be apologizing to you for putting you through all this for the last year.\"\n\nShe sat with me at the hospital, both of us afraid to take our eyes off Dale as he sat placidly in his hospital bed. \n\nI asked him about what he had gone through, but he couldn't tell me much. He said that he got lost in the cave, and he crawled and crawled until he came out in the playpark again. Only it wasn't his playpark. The playpark he found was different, and me and his friends were gone.\n\n\"The sky was, sort of, purple, and the clouds were too thick looking to be real. I couldn't get the gate open, but that was probably good. There were these big things that would come by, like living shadows, and they would look at me like how we look at animals in the zoo. I drank some water from a gross puddle, but there was no food. I sometimes went to sleep in the caves, but I always felt like something was watching me there. It never tried to hurt me, but it always felt like I was hiding and waiting for someone to catch me. I thought I was gonna starve before I heard you breathing in the cave. I had ran away to get away from some shadowy people who were looking at me, and I heard you down there and went to see what the sound was.\"\n\nI asked him about the messages and he said he’d found a marker of of some sort in the sand in the other play park.\n\nThat was about the time he’d started seeing a shadow inside the park.\n\n“I knew it was you, I just knew it, but you couldn’t see me. So I started leaving messages, hoping you would find them. I guess you must have.”\n\nThe strangest part is that Dale swears that he was only there for a week. He says he kept going back into the cave but that he only slept a few times while he was away. What's more, the doctors say he doesn't appear to have grown any in the time he was gone. His dental records and growth structure are the same as they were at his last check-up about a month before he disappeared.   \n\nI'm glad to have Dale back, but I don't let him play in the cave anymore. We still visit the playpark, and I still let him slide on the slides and run on the structure like he used to, but he is forbidden to go underneath anymore. It's a rule he doesn't mind following, lest he get lost in those dark tunnels for a second time."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n\"Juliet, send in my eleven thirty.\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor Winter.\"\n\nPamella Winters sat back, tapping her pen on her steno pad as Mrs. Janet Welch came through the door. She glanced around fearfully, looking at the small office as if expecting to see medieval torture devices. So many came into her office expecting to see alchemic devices or sci-fi equipment, but Doctor Winter was a woman of science.\n\nShe supposed, however, that when you saw a place called Doctor Winter's Forgetfulness Clinic, you had certain expectations beyond a board-certified therapist in a cloudy gray pantsuit.\n\nDoctor Winter had seven, one for each day of the week, and Johan kept them pressed for her so they would look nice when she needed them.\n\nJohan was dear, and Pamella was lucky to have her.\n\n\"So, Mrs. Welch,\" Doctor Winter began.\n\n\"Please, call me Janet. Everyone just calls me Janet.\"\n\n\"Very well. Janet, what brings you into my clinic today?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Janet said, biting her lip as she seemed to rethink ever coming here, \"something happened last week, something I'd really like to forget.\"\n\nDoctor Winter smiled, \"Well, that's why I'm here. Why don't you tell me about it?\"\n\nJanet shuddered, looking around as if she thought something might be waiting to get her. She was clearly a runner, her arms and what she could see of her legs looking tan and toned. She was wearing capri pants and a lovely blue sweater, her hair in a ponytail that seemed very comfortable to her. Her face, however, seemed anything but comfortable. Janet had clearly encountered something, and whatever it had been, it had rattled her badly.\n\n\"Wait, don't you need to put me under or something? Hypnotize me? Put me into a receptive state?\"\n\nPamella smiled, \"I certainly can if you'd like, but I don't have to. Can I offer you some tea? It's a special blend I make myself. It puts people at ease so they can tell me their problems.\"\n\n\"I don't really,\" Janet began, but seemed to think better of it as she nodded, \"on second thought, yes, I'd love some.\"\n\nDoctor Winter got up and poured the tea from an ordinary-looking pot on a hot plate. As she brought the cup, Janet looked into the smoke before blowing on the liquid and taking a sip. She made an appreciative noise as she took another, the liquid steamy but not quite as hot as she had believed. She sat on the edge of the couch with her legs drawn up, looking like a child who was afraid to tell her parents she's pregnant.\n\nDoctor Winter invited her to begin, and Janet told her of her strange experience in the woods.  \n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nJanet stood upright from her stretch, filling her lungs with the crisp evening air.\n\nShe loved these early evening runs, the sun setting over her shoulder. As she began to jog through the parking lot, heading for the forest trail, she popped her earbuds in and hit play on her Running Playlist. Her sneakers sent up puffs of dust as she went from concrete to dirt, and Janet could hear the quiet evening conversations of birds and other small animals. They took to their heels when they saw her jogging toward them, and Janet saw a fat rabbit take off as it disappeared into the underbrush. She couldn't help but grin her Colgate whites at its cottontail.\n\n\"That's right,\" she thought as the rabbit ran, \"make way for the apex predator.\"\n\nJanet jogged around the small pond and shivered a little as she saw the steam rise from the water. It was cold this evening, and the surface of the water looked glassy as she watched the fish dart about their simple lives. Did they know there was a world above their translucent home? They must, she thought since too many of them likely got their reminder at the end of a hook that there were dangers up above. She rounded the corner of the pond and headed into the woods that made up the bulk of her run. \n\nShe stopped suddenly, though, looking around as she jogged in place. She had felt something, something she had never felt here before. She had run here for years, almost every day since moving to the area, and had never felt anything like this. Something had noticed her that was higher on the food chain than she was, something that saw her as meal.\n\nJanet shrugged it off as she took to the trails. There was nothing bigger than a deer out in these woods, the only exception being the black bears that sometimes moved out here. They were mostly cowards, choosing to run rather than attack people, but Janet had never seen one up close. More than likely, Janet was just feeling a little tense after the posters she had seen on the way in, and she pushed herself on as she took to the trails.\n\nMost people were on edge after the man had disappeared near here, but that had been a hiker. He had gone missing on the trails several miles from here, and there was no proof that he wasn't alive. The state park hiking trails linked up with the Appalachian trail in several places. Who was to say that he hadn't decided to simply extend his hike for several weeks? The fact that he'd told his wife that he was going out for a day hike seemed to refute this, but Janet put it out of her mind as the trees leaned crookedly over the path.\n\nThe trails were miles from here, and Janet didn't feel like she was in any danger running on a public jogging path.\n\nAs her jogging tunes kept her company, Brittany and Katie Perry pushing her on, Janet felt the woods pull close around her as she ran. She didn't feel uncomfortable under the watchful eyes of the trees. Quite the opposite, the trees were like arms that longed to hug, and Janet felt at ease the deeper onto the trail she went. She had forgotten all about the weird feeling she'd felt before. Now she was back in her element, her strong legs taking her forward as her earbuds pumped her ears with the invigorating sound of her favorite exercise tunes.\n\nIt began as a tickle on the back of her neck, the feeling something akin to a sunburn, and Janet found herself turning to look at the woods as the trees whipped past. It made her uncomfortable, and Janet put her hand out to run at the spot on the back of her neck more than once. She had thought, at first, that it might be a mosquito or a fly, but she never found anything as her fingers explored the space. She found her hand returning there again and again as she ran, and it made the crawly feeling in her stomach feel worse over time. She had tried to shove discomfort down, but it became harder and harder to justify the deeper she went.\n\nJanet reminded herself that the trail was only three miles and that she was roughly a mile in.\n\nAs long as she kept moving, she had little doubt that she could outdistance anything that might be following her.\n\nThe path took her over a little bridge, and Janet stopped to look down at the water below as she covertly hit the pause button on her phone. The water was moving fast today, the little river sweeping the last of the fall leaves down with the current, but Janet let her eyes dart right and left as she swept the peripherals of her vision. She didn't dare remove her earbuds, wanting the illusion of being unable to hear what was chasing. Something crunched in the woods to her left, and Janet had to stop herself from looking over at it fretfully. Was it a deer? A squirrel? Maybe someone stalking her, getting ready to leap out and grab her?\n\nShe couldn't see anything in that direction, but when something rustled the leaves from the other side of the path, the side she had yet to go running down, Janet let her fear get the better of her. She swung her head in that direction, seeing a monster amongst the late autumn leaves for half a heartbeat, only to realize it was just a crow who had landed amongst them to root for breakfast. She laughed a little, feeling stupid as she realized she had let her paranoia get the better of her. The crow looked up curiously, startled by her laughter, and that made Janet laugh all the harder.\n\nThen, something broke behind her, and she turned in a panic as her laugh died on her lips.\n\nShe slipped on the wet boards, the moss making them slick, and as she fell onto her bottom, she saw something hunkered in the woods. It was dark, blending in with the afternoon shadows as the sun set, and in her fear, she imagined some great beast on all fours. Its eyeless face was lost behind a black halo, its hands like scrabbling claws, and as she slipped on the slick boards, she could see it crawling towards her over the dead leaves and skeletal limbs that littered the forest floor.\n\nJanet slid backward off the bridge, her feet finally finding purchase as she took off. She ran flat out, her terror high as she put as much distance between herself and whatever it had been as she could. Her rational mind tried to assert that it was probably just a dog, a small bear, but she was having none of it. She came to a fork, one way taking her towards the hiking trails and the other continuing on the running trail, and she took the right that would keep her on this trail. She was a mile in, but she couldn't turn around. Whatever it was had been in that direction, and Janet knew that if she wanted to make it out she needed to run away from it.\n\nShe had run almost half a mile in a panic before her lungs started to have trouble pulling in the cold air, and she doubled over on the trail. \n\nAs she tried to keep from bringing up her lunch, she looked at the suddenly claustrophobic trees that gathered around the path. No longer did they seem in a hugging mood. As the sun set behind them, the shadows creating angels where there had been none before, Janet could see the knobby fingers of skeletal hands. They were trying to grab her, to hold her down so the beast could get her, and as Janet tried to remember how to make her lungs work again, she heard the sound she had been dreading and spun in place.\n\nThe sound of limb cracking sent an icicle through her heart, and she stumbled a few steps before realizing she could see what had made the sound.\n\nA deer had stepped out onto the path, clearly feeling safer than her in the waning afternoon. It had a magnificent rack of antlers, the points glistening wetly as it looked at her distrustfully. To this thing, Janet was the predator, and Janet took a few steps back as she gave the buck his space. She wondered if this was what she had seen earlier? Maybe she had startled it as she ran like a crazy person through the woods. Maybe it had just been trying to crop a little grass when she had startled it.\n\nIt ran suddenly, Janet watching it go, and that was when she saw it.\n\nIt had been no deer, after all.\n\nJust a man in blue jeans and a black hoodie.\n\nThe hoodie covered his face, leaving his features a murky guess at best. His jeans were stained with mud and dirt and looked like they might stand up on their own if he took them off. He wore cheap tennis shoes that looked ready to fall apart, and they were muddy and stained up too much to tell their original color.\n\nHe had noticed her noticing him, and when his hand came out of the front pocket, it was holding a large hunting knife.\n\nJanet suddenly remembered how to run, suddenly remembered how to pull air into her lungs, and screamed as she pelted off into the woods. She was lost to reason; she had no sense of where she was going. She only knew that wherever it was, it was away from the man with the knife. She ran into the woods, the trees grabbing at her as their knobbly branches scratched her arms and face. They tried to grab her clothes, but the expensive jogging gear was tight against her skin, and their clutching limbs slid off her. She kept looking behind her, trying to see if the man was following her, but in the early twilight and she couldn't see much. The sun would be down in about twenty minutes, and then she would be at the mercy of the woods by night. She had run the path a thousand times, thought she had known these woods so well, but now she was hopelessly lost, running for her life.\n\nShe chanced a look behind her and turned back in time to feel the root grab her foot.\n\nShe fell against the tree, knocking the wind out of herself as she went down amidst the dirt and leaves.\n\nHer frantic feet churned up the hard ground, rolling her over and giving her a great view of the man as he stalked in, knife at the ready.\n\n\"Please,\" she wheezed out, her breath still gone, \"please,\" she tried again, but she couldn't make anything come out.\n\nToo winded to even beg for her life, how pathetic she must seem.\n\nSo much for being an apex predator.\n\nThe real predator had found her as she went about her day and now meant to gobble her up.\n\nShe could see the bottom of his mouth as a wide smile grew from it. He was stalking in, the knife still held down and at his side, and as she wiggled left to try and juke around him, he jumped to match her. It was all a game to him, an enjoyable distraction, but now it was over. Now, he meant to have his prize, whatever that might be.\n\nAs he loomed over her, pulling the knife back for a stab, Janet closed her eyes and prayed that he would just kill her and not decide to stretch out her terror.\n\nThey stood there for what felt like an eternity, Janet wanting him to get on with it when he sighed in ecstasy.\n\nShe felt something patter across her face, warm and thick but cooling quickly as it dappled her cheeks and eyelids.\n\nShe felt sick, her fears realized, but when she opened her eyes to peek, her left eye was covered by a film of red.\n\nThe man stood over her, his hoody now sporting three long rips in the chest as something pushed its way out. He had bled on her, his grin fading as he gasped out the last of his life. The knife fell from his limp fingers, sticking in the ground blade first, and as his legs tried to give way, he was pulled backward by something much larger.\n\nThe sun was setting behind the thing as it crouched amongst the trees, and Janet had to put a shaky hand up to see the creature. It looked like a toad, a massive toad with granite green skin, perched on its bottom as it drew the man towards it. It towered amongst the trees, fifteen or sixteen feet high, its arms long and spindly, its fingers tipped with cruel claws. It brought the man back to look him in the eye, smiling as it saw the fear it had wanted. The man was seizing, shaking as the blood dripped down those long claws, and when the creature leaned forward, Janet could see its mouth was full of similar jagged teeth. The crunch when it bit the man's arm off was accentuated by his wheezy scream as he shook violently. It ate his other arm, grinning as the blood ran and the hooded man cried out pitifully. Janet could only watch as the legs came off next, the creature finally ending the man's sobbing as it slid the dribbling torso into its mouth and crunched with relish.\n\nIt was licking its fingers when it finally noticed Janet, and its smile was no less frightful as its piss-yellow eyes fastened onto her. \n\n\"Don't worry,\" it said, its voice like angry bees caught in a jar, \"I have no intention of eating you.\"\n\nIt slithered in, its body elongating as it drew very close to Janet. She could tell now that it had been hunching before, its body much bigger than she had thought, and the knowledge did little to quell her fear. Its face came right up until it blocked out the sun, those horrible eyes almost hypnotizing her as they stared right through her. Janet felt her bladder let go, her running pants holding the liquid in as they had held her sweat so many times before. She thought it would lie, thought it would eat her anyway, but instead, it just whispered to her in that hissy little voice, telling her what she had known all along, but never wanted to hear.\n\n\"I only eat predator, only desire the taste of those who have taken lives and reveled in their end. You, my dear, are no killer. Hop back to your warren, little rabbit. A true hunter moves amongst these woods.\"\n\nJanet closed her eyes, the tears and snot running down her face in rivulets, and when she opened them again, she was alone.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\"After that, I got up and managed to find the path before it got too dark. I expecting that thing to get me at any minute, but instead, I made it back to my car. I drove home and sat in the car till my husband came to ask if I was okay. I couldn't tell him about the creature or the man. I just told him something had spooked me in the woods. I've dreamed about that creature every night, though.\" she said, the tears falling into her cup as she looked into her reflection, \"I haven't run since; something I love that helps me deal with stress like this, and I don't know if I ever will again.\"\n\nDoctor Winter nodded, \"You had a very traumatic experience, but,\" and when she said the word, she saw Janet tense as if someone's hand tightened a piano wire in her spine, \"I think anyone would be a little rattled if they were the victim of a bear attack.\"\n\n\"A bear attack?\" Janet said, almost dreamily.\n\n\"Yes, just as you told me. You were running and came upon a mother bear and her cubs. Black bears don't usually hurt people, but she was just protecting her babies. She chased you away, and you ran, scared out of your mind, as anyone would be. You ran all the way back to your car, and then you drove home. Your mind has made quite a lot of it, but if you're careful, you probably won't find yourself the target of a mother bear again.\"\n\nJanet's face was slack, her mind reeling as it mulled over this new information.\n\nDoctor Winter wrinkled her nose as Janet's mouth opened, and the tea spilled into the cup again.\n\nThis was her least favorite part of the exercise, but it was necessary.\n\n\"That's right. It was just a bear and her cubs. Poor old thing, I never even stopped to think of it like that. Thank you, Doctor Winter. I feel much better now.\"\n\nDoctor Winter smiled, \"That's the idea, my dear. I help my clients put things into perspective. I help them forget their fear and remember that nothing was really as bad as they remember.\"\n\nJanet got up, handing Doctor Winter her cup. She looked a thousand times calmer than she had when she'd come in. This was the woman who'd gone running in the woods, Winter saw. This was the woman whose worldview had been shaken by her encounter with something far older and far darker than a mother bear and her whelps. Janet had seen something few people walked away from, and she was lucky to be alive.\n\nShe would never know how lucky she was, but that was the idea.\n\nDoctor Winter waited for the door to snick closed before taking the cup to sink, where she kept her small green fish net. This part was delicate, and she didn't want to lose it. Reaching into the cabinet over the sink, she took out a mason jar and set it in the drain before beginning.\n\nYou only lost a few of them down the sink before you got smart about it.\n\nTipping the cup over the net, Doctor Winter poured out the tea as she strained the liquid, looking for the memory. The cup was heavier than it had been full, and Winter just knew there would be something juicy at the bottom. It joggled as she tipped the cup over, and a large, white, rubbery thing fell into the net with a wet slap. It was a little smaller than a fist, the center glowing a little as it winked like a firefly. Winter tipped it into the jar, pouring some tea on top of it before she put the lid on, lifting it up to have a look.\n\nIt was like ice as it floated at the midpoint, and if Doctor Winter looked closely, she could see the horrific face of the creature as it got in Janet's face and delivered its terrible proclamation. \n\nDoctor Winter smiled as she put the jar in the cupboard, several other colorful balls of semi-liquid winking in the dark space.\n\nAnother satisfied customer."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nI'm an Uber driver in the Atlanta area. It's a great place to be an Uber driver, and there's always someone who needs a ride somewhere. I spend six hours a day in college classes, another eight sleeping, and the rest of my time shuttling people to and fro around the Atlanta area. I've been doing this for about three years, and in that time, I've seen it all. I've had drunken frat boys that threatened to kick my ass when I wouldn't give them a ride. I've had annoying, nagging passengers whose constant wants make you want to pull your hair out. I've seen the occasional cheating spouse hoping not to get caught, the local celebrities on their way to events, and online influencers who think their way more important than their subscriber count would suggest, to name a few. I've had my share of funny moments; the lady whose husband and her potential lover met her on the motel sidewalk and yelled at her before deciding to go have a beer will never get old. I've had some scary times; the lady with the neck wound who nearly bled out in the back of my car after her boyfriend just pushed her in and ran comes to mind, for certain. Despite all my experience, though, this story definitely falls under the weird category.\n\nI guess we can upgrade it to the scary category all told.\n\nAny night where I almost lose my life can definitely be called scary.\n\nThis happened in October, about a week before Halloween. My girlfriend and I live in a duplex near campus. I've lived there for the last four years, and she's lived with me for the last six months. We were taking a semester off since none of the classes we needed were available this fall, and on the night in question, I was hurrying to get ready, so I could drop her off at the airport before I started working. She was going on a weekend trip to see her parent's house in Virginia, and I'd have the house to myself all weekend. I was a little skeptical about her destination, but I decided to let her dig her own grave if my suspicions were correct. Maybe it was all the extra time I was spending at home, but I'd started to notice that something was a little off about her lately. She'd been fired from her job recently, and though she kept saying she was going to get another one, I didn't see her making any effort to do so. All she seemed to do was talk to people on Discord. She had gotten really into this local group, spooky stuff from what I'd seen, and she was constantly chatting and texting with them.\n\nI was suspicious, but I wasn't really worried.\n\nAt that point, I figured the worst she could do was dump me.\n\nWe chatted on the way to the airport, talking about what she'd do once she got there and how much she would miss me. She bemoaned how bored she would be at her parent's house, and when we arrived at the airport, she kissed me goodbye and headed off into the busy terminal. As she left for her parent's house or wherever she was going, I decided to get some work in as long as I was at the airport.\n\nI pulled into the temporary parking area and signed into my Uber app. The airport was usually an excellent place to find fares, and sure enough, someone was trying to get a lift. He wanted to go to a hotel nearby, and after agreeing to the ride, I moved back into the concourse to pick him up. He was a big dude, around six feet and muscular. He had a bag, which he put in my trunk, and a smaller bag that he kept on his lap. I asked him where he was going, and he verified the address, so off we went.\n\nHe was pretty quiet the whole way there. He looked cramped in my back seat, like a sardine in a can, but he took it well. Mostly he just played on his phone, typing away to someone as we rode in silence. This wasn't that uncommon, and I honestly preferred clients who weren't chatterboxes. There's nothing worse than trying to hear your GPS over some drunk backseat DJ who wants the Aux or some tourist who wants a guided tour of the city as you dodge rush hour traffic. We drove for about twenty minutes before pulling up outside this motel without much fuss. I told the guy we'd arrived, and he quickly slipped the phone into his carry-on and offered to tip me for arriving so quickly. I said it wasn't necessary since that sort of thing was usually handled through the app, but when he slipped a twenty up next to my head, I took it with thanks. Rules or not, money is money. He asked if I'd pop the trunk, and when he had his suitcase, he thanked me and walked towards the front building.\n\nI was getting ready to check the app for fares in my area when I heard a noise from the back seat.\n\nIt was that high-pitched DING noise that so many phones use for notifications, and when I looked in the backseat, I realized the guy had forgotten his carry-on. It had slipped into the floorboard, and I could see the backlight on his cellphone through the mesh. I dug out the phone and started to reach for the door when my eyes registered what the message on the lock screen had said. A picture of a pretty blond girl was next to the message, and she was asking if he'd gotten to the hotel yet? Another popped up to say that she was running a little late, but she'd be there in five. She couldn't wait to meet everyone, and she was so glad that she had finally done this, and it was about time they all got together and…\n\nAnd the picture was of my girlfriend.\n\nI just stared at the phone for a few minutes before someone honked at me, and I drove into the parking lot. A cab had just pulled up behind me, and as I parked, I couldn't help but notice when my girlfriend stepped out and walked towards the hotel. She still had her suitcase, furry boots, parka, and leggings that she'd left the house in, and she smiled hugely as she looked up at the hotel. She clearly hadn't seen me, which was good because I had about a thousand questions I would have likely bombarded her with. She was supposed to be on a flight to Virginia, but instead, it looked like she was talking with some random guy on Discord. Was she cheating? Cheating seemed to be the most obvious answer, but...why? We had never had any problems. Our relationship had been smooth since the beginning. Why now was she…\n\nThe phone dinged as another message popped up, but this one was from a different guy.\n\n\"How many have arrived?\" he asked.\n\nMy girlfriend responded. \"Five, Master. Damian seems to have lost his phone, but he's here too.\"\n\nI had meant to check for fares in the area, but instead, I found myself watching the phone as the messages rolled in. I was in full information gathering mode now, and anything I could come back with would help me in the long run. If this was a misunderstanding or something, I wanted to know before I melted down on my girlfriend. As it stood, though, it was beginning to look very sketchy. I couldn't open the phone, of course. It was one of those fingerprint locks that won't open without a password or a fingerprint, and since I knew neither, all I could do was watch the dialog boxes come up. The boxes only stayed until another box came up, and often the messages were too long for the boxes to contain the whole message, so I was forced to read a little at a time.\n\nWhat I read made me think my initial suspicion might have been off.\n\nAt first, it looked like she was meeting some people at a hotel for an unspecified event. As I waited, I saw other people approach the hotel, their faces matching the images on the app. I was pretty sure that these people were the ones she was waiting for because their arrival at the desk was followed by confirmation that someone else had arrived. After eight or nine of them had gone up, they began talking to this mysterious \"Master.\" The more they talked, the more I realized that this wasn't a weird sex thing. The group started asking him about \"The Ascension\" and \"The Altar Site,\" to which he responded that they would learn more tonight. He asked my girlfriend if the \"Sacrifice\" was ready, and she informed him that it would be there when the time came. He quoted some verses that sounded pseudo-biblical and referred to them as \"The Coven\" several times.\n\nThe more I read, the more I began to believe that she might be part of a cult instead.\n\nI sat outside the hotel for several hours, and as it was getting dark, he told them that the preparations were taking longer than expected. He told them they should meet him at the Altar Site and sent directions, which I got about half of. He told them to be there before dark, and like a flock of birds, they came from the hotel and moved towards cars parked in the lot. I ducked down, not wanting to be seen, and I watched as she got into a late-model black sedan. The sedan drove away in a convoy of other vehicles, and since I didn't have all the directions, I cranked my car and followed them. As they moved out of town and onto the highway, I tried not to make it obvious that I was tailing them. The freeway was busy, it being close enough to end-of-day traffic that I could hide in the crowd, but as they left the interstate, it became harder to blend in. As the sun sinks, I saw them turn off onto an access road, their cars kicking up dust as they rumbled down the gravel road. I didn't want to lose them, wherever they were going, so I pulled off to the side of the road and, after a few minutes, I followed.\n\nIt turned out that where they were going was Panola State Park.\n\nAs I drove down the bumpy outlet road, the sun started to set for real. The trees started leaning in on me like hands in a funhouse, and the road was so narrow that if someone decided to leave, I'd be in for some trouble. The darkness had swallowed my car before I reached the end, and all at once, my headlights created beacons of light in the encroaching darkness. The park is beautiful during the day, but in the late afternoon shadows, it had a spooky look to it that only a wooded area in fall can pull off. I suddenly had Blair Witch flashbacks as I trundled through the spooky backdrop. My girlfriend was definitely into some weird stuff here, weirder than even my imagination could have conjured, and I knew that I needed to get her out of here before things got bad.\n\nWhen I reached the end of the outlet road, I found a dark parking lot with several cars in it. It must have been parking for a campground once upon a time. I could see a bathroom and a picnic area off the parking lot, and the lot was flanked by lights that no longer worked. I turned off my lights and got out of the car, but when no one immediately came out to get me, I figured they had moved on. I snuck around the buildings, and sure enough, they were bathrooms. One was a women's bathroom and shower facility, and the other was for men. Both were unlocked, but the doors had a very broken-into look. Someone had set a couple of tents in the shadowy space between the buildings and the forest, but so far, I had seen no one. As I took a step towards the tents, however, a bright light sprang up to my left, and I saw a large bonfire crackling in the woods. It was off to the side of the campground, and for a moment, the sudden flash left me glare blind. When hands caught me under the arms and drug me forward, I was momentarily unable to fight back. By the time my eyes adjusted to the sudden flare of light, I was already close enough to feel the bonfire's heat and hear the chanting of those around it. It had been low at first, but now it had reached a fever pitch as they drew me closer to the fire.\n\nI struggled, but the two men who had me were much bigger than I was. I was pretty sure that one of them was my fare from earlier, and we came up just short of walking into the fire. A robed man in a lacquered mask stepped up and raised his hands for silence, the chanters tapering off as they turned toward him. We stood in silence for thirty seconds before the masked man spoke. Unlike the muscle-bound men holding me, this guy was not on speaking terms with physical exercise. His robe bulged in the front, and had I not been suspended between the two men, he would have still been a head shorter than me. When he spoke, it was apparent who had the power here.\n\nThis one must have been \"Master.\"\n\n\"As I told you, as sister Serenity said, the sacrifice has arrived.\"\n\nAnother robed figure moved away from the group and stood beside the fat robed man. She was about my height and had shoulder-length blonde hair. When I met her gaze, I realized it was my girlfriend. I wondered why I didn't recognize her at first, but it became apparent almost immediately. In the firelight, her hair was a frizzy mess as opposed to the straight and silky curtain she almost always kept it in. She looked almost feral as she stared at me, and I didn't see any of her usual warmth there. All her love or happiness was gone, and she looked at me as though I was meat.\n\nLike I was something that would bring her joy once it was cooked black and offered on a plate.\n\nI was put on my knees before her, and the fat man handed her a silver knife that he drew out a scabbard like a magic trick. She looked at the knife like she'd never seen one before, and as she returned to reality, she approached me with the blade. I finally realized what I should have seen from the beginning. I was the sacrifice. He'd left the phone in my car on purpose, and even though there was no way she could have known he'd get in my car, somehow she had. She had meant for me to be here, for me to be her sacrifice, and as she raised the knife, I had to know why.\n\n\"Why did you do this? I thought you loved me?\" I said, sounding pathetic but still dying to know what this was all about.\n\nShe looked at me, surprised, before saying, \"Because it's why I got with you in the first place. There's always a sacrifice before the coming of Winter. The Green Man requires a gift, and it was my turn this year. I had to have someone to give to the fire, and you were there to fill the role.\"\n\nAnd with that, she raised the knife, and I closed my eyes as I prepared for the strike.\n\nWhen the bullhorn sounded, it scared me just as much as it scared them.\n\n\"Drop the knife and put your hands in the air! You're all under arrest for... Don't move, or we'll…\" but it was too late.\n\nThe knife clattered to the ground next to my head, and they all scattered like quail. I was dumped face-first to the ground, unceremoniously, as my two captors beat feet for the woods. The sounds of shouts and boots and the occasional gunshot surround me, and I lay still as I hoped not to be shot out of hand. Eventually, a pair of boots come into my peripheral vision, and my hands are jerked back as I'm flex-cuffed and lifted up so the officer could have a look at me.\n\nA half-hour later, I'm in a detective's office with a warm cup of coffee and recently freed wrists.\n\nThe man sitting across from me is Reinhold, an agent with the FBI.\n\nHe's very interested in the phone I've just put in his hand.\n\n\"We've been tracking these guys for years. They come to Atlanta the most often of any of their other haunts, and it leads me to believe that most of them are from here. About once every three years, we find a body at a state park. They take their organs, scribble some runes on the VIC, and just leave him there. Usually, the animals have found them before we do. You're actually the first victim we've managed to find alive. It's a wonder we found you in time.\"\n\nHe told me a lot of things that evening. He told me about this Green Man they all worship, some eastern European god or something, and how they believe that if they don't make a sacrifice, he will bring terrible fury down upon man. They always make a sacrifice right before Halloween, and it's always some random person they've probably known for less than a year. I gave him my girlfriend's name and the name the guy from the airport had used, but he told me neither one checked out. Both were likely fake names, used to cover their tracks, and despite messaging my girlfriend, all I've received is a notice that the number has been canceled.\n\nSo that's where I stand now. I'm afraid to go home because she has a house key. I'm afraid to go to my parent's house because she's met them. I don't know who to talk to, where to turn, and how many of our friends are involved in this little cult too? The detective told me to be very careful, after all, because while they didn't catch my girlfriend, they did catch someone.\n\nHe took me into a little room with the one-way glass and had me identify a pudgy man in a robe. He was talking to another detective in a very animated way, the man staying calm despite the amount of flailing he was doing. He asked if this was the one my girlfriend had been talking to, her so-called Master, and I nodded. The man suddenly leaned forward and yelled at the detective, who sat back quickly despite the man's hands being chained to the table. Spit flew from his mouth as he yelled, and even through the glass, I could hear what he was screaming.\n\n\"You don't get it, you idiots don't get it. We aren't worshiping the Green Man. We are here to protect you all from him. If his fall sacrifice is not received, then he will come. He will come, and he will kill! You have to release me. The sacrifice must be COMPLETED!\" \n\nThat was about the time two other officers ran in and restrained him, but his message was clear enough. \n\nIf anyone reading this has any information, I'd suggest you go to the police. These Green Men guys will have to strike again and soon. If they believe that their actions keep us safe, if their delusion is something that must be accomplished, then any one of you may be in danger. I was groomed for six months, kept safe like a pig for slaughter, but they don't have the time to be so choosy anymore.\n\nThe Green Man must be appeased and soon lest we suffer his wrath.\n\nWho knows which of you might find yourself beside a fire this year."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nLisa saw him sitting on the back porch, his ax laid across his lap.\n\n\"Tom?\" she asked, coming up behind him to put a hand on his shoulder.\n\nMatt nodded, glancing over as their baby girl squirmed in Lisa's arms. Sara was growing fast, three months old now, and it was hard for Matt to imagine life without her. She was his first child, and his life had changed so much since she'd been born. The money had finally come through. The bank had decided they were stable enough to receive the loan they needed. The farm was on the verge of finally becoming what it had once been.\n\nMatt was ready to transition from the state's largest turkey farm to the state's largest dairy farm and cattle ranch.\n\nOld Tom, the last of the farm's turkeys, was all that was left of that legacy. \n\nOld Tom stood at the edge of the fence, looking at the now cleared field and the newly constructed cowshed that had taken the place of the long turkey sheds that had once graced the land. He had been standing there for days, watching the direction the trucks had taken his last few children, and Matt was a little worried for him. Old Tom hadn't eaten, hadn't drunk any water, and hadn't moved in nearly three days. That's why Matt was sitting there now, trying to muster the courage to do what must be done.\n\nLisa kissed the top of his head and took Sara inside, leaving him with his thoughts.\n\nMatt imagined that Old Tom knew these were his last few days.\n\nOld Tom had been with the family for years. When Matt's grandfather had died, the farm had been on the verge of bankruptcy. It had been a cattle ranch at that time. They had supplied beef to many of the surrounding towns, had signed a lucrative contract with the local schools to supply fresh beef, but as good as the times were, they had turned in a matter of months. Disease had spread through the cows, killing them and making the meat worthless. The land had been covered in the rotting corpses of their prized cows, and Matt's grandfather had slipped away in the night of the same unknown illness. His son, Matt's father, had told Matt that his grandad had been a strapping man at six-foot, a mountain of muscle, but the disease had shriveled him like a grape and aged him well before his time. No one knew what it was or where it had come from, but it had killed him as quickly as the cows, and soon all his Dad had was a farm of corpses.\n\nThat was when Old Tom had come.\n\nMatt's Dad had been standing in the field one morning, contemplating selling the farm so he could be done with this place, when he saw three turkeys come wandering out of the woods. They had come through the field and made a beeline for him, and his Dad couldn't believe his luck. He had reached for his gun, meaning to kill them and take them home for supper, but the middle turkey had fixed him with a withering look, and he couldn't even summon the strength to pull the trigger. All three had wandered past him, taking up residents in the barn, and his Dad had let them stay. Maybe, he thought, he'd kill them tomorrow and have a meal then. They were in the barn, and they clearly weren't going anywhere.\n\nThe next day, though, his father discovered a surprise. Both hens had lain eggs in the barn, with one nest near the gate and one near the back. Dad said Old Tom had looked at him, and something inside had told him that the eggs near the door were for him. That same feeling also told him that trying and collecting anything from the back would be a fight he didn't want. His Dad left both sets be. He had devised a plan the night before, a plan involving the turkeys that had roosted in his barn, and the addition of young turkeys would only help it along. Dad fed them and housed them in the barn to his wife's ire. They had enough to worry about, with a failing farm and her six months pregnant with Matt. His Dad stood firm, though, that the turkeys would be good to have. About a month later, there had been little turkeys, and Matt's Mom had begun to see the value of the plan. Matt's Dad had always marveled at how they had grown. They needed only minimal attention and grew much larger than any turkey he had ever seen. They ate up the food he gave them and seemed to grow huge on what amounted to scraps. Five months after they'd hatched, his Dad had taken ten toms to the country fair. Some of them had won prizes, but all of them had been sold. He'd come home with no turkeys, but Dad had made enough money to get by for a little while.\n\nEvery year after that, there had been ten to twenty turkeys waiting to go to market several times a year. The ones he was to take were always set away from the rest of the turkey family who had taken over the old barn, and Matt's father was always careful to leave a selection of Hens behind. Old Tom, it seemed, was better at population control than his Dad, though. Old Tom allowed him to cull his herd, and in exchange, he received a safe place to stay and more food than they strictly needed. Old Tom made the farm profitable. Hell, he made it a household name within the state, and a Turkey might as well be the family crest.\n\nDad had warned Matt on his deathbed, though, not to do what he was planning. \n\n\"You can't go back, son. Turkeys are our legacy, and so shall they remain.\"\n\nMatt had placated him but had already set things in motion that couldn't be undone. \n\nBesides, he was tired of turkeys.\n\nIt was time for a new era on this farm.\n\nIt was time to make some sacrifices.\n\nHe got up and walked towards the old turkey. Old Tom didn't move, he was a trusting old thing, and he let Matt move up to the fence so he could follow the old turkeys' gaze. His sightline ran off into the field, towards the road where the Sanderson Farms trucks had taken his kin. \n\nMatt shook his head as he thought about it. That had been a fight. Tom's brood had swollen to fill the other three sheds and three more that had been built just for him and his children. Half of those born were culled and sent out to take their place in the trucks every cycle. However, the turkeys in the back of the barns were almost like royalty. They lived untouched for generations, and they had been in no hurry to give that life up.\n\nThey had taken the invasion of their home very badly. The men had come in to get them, long gloves and leather smocks, but more than a few of them had left with cuts on their faces and long slashes on their gloves. The turkeys that were this cycle's sacrifice, five hundred docile birds, had walked onto the truck as though hypnotized. When the men returned for the rest, though, the turkeys still in the barns had looked at the men with distrust. They had fought, swooping down on the men, fighting them with surprising ferocity. By the end of the day, they had loaded close to a thousand birds into the backs of the trucks and taken them away.\n\nMatt had assumed that Old Tom had been among them, but then he'd recognizable the white head, and blood-red waddle as the ancient bird stared at him through the fence.\n\nOne of the men had offered to go get him, but Matt had refused.\n\nOld Tom was his, and he would let the turkey live until the time came for him to grace their table this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"Sorry old fella, but times are changing. I'm moving on from turkey; I'm moving up in the world. It's time for a change. It's time for your legacy to end.\"\n\nThe turkey turned his head to Matt, making him feel even sillier for talking to a bird, and that's when he heard a hateful voice crawl across my mind.\n\n\"My legacy may end, but it won't end alone.\"\n\nMatt stared at the turkey, his mouth hanging open a little. What the hell was that? Was he losing it? He had been through a lot of stress lately, designating graze land and fixing up the old barns, but not enough to hear a freaking turkey talk. Matt looked around suddenly, wondering if someone was goofing with him, but it was just the Methuselah of a turkey and he.\n\n\"Did...did you just…\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Old Tom said in his head, turning back to the field, \"just as I did to your father when we first met. I doubt he told you. He thought he was mad. You have sent my children away, condemned my hens to a slow death in cages, but it needn't end like this. I can call more hens. I can sire more turkey. The cycle can continue. Your family name can once again be known for the flesh of my people, and I will continue to live.\"\n\nMatt thought about it. The turkey trade had been good for them. It had gotten them through some hard times. He could do both, Matt thought. He could have cows, bulls, and turkeys. He could split the sheds. They could share the farm. He could...keep stepping in shit every morning and having dreams where he was five years old with a bucket of feed and a swarm of skeletal turkeys swarming around him before Dad picked him up. Matt could stop having dreams about looking down and seeing their hateful little eyes as they stared up at him. He could stop the dreams where he found his daughter's corpse picked clean in the shed while this hateful old bird stood nearby and looked on placidly.\n\nHe could stop all of that with just a swing of his ax, and he meant to.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Matt said, hefting the ax as he prepared to swing.\n\nTom stuck out his neck and looked at him with eyes full of malice.\n\n\"Then go ahead and doom your line forever.\"\n\nThe sound of the ax coming down would haunt Matt for the rest of his life, but he slept like a baby that night.\n\nThe last peaceful sleep he would ever have.\n\nThe sound of people knocking woke them the next day. Matt looked at the clock and was horrified to discover that it was almost ten o'clock. Lisa came groggily awake, looking around frantically as she asked him why they hadn't woken up earlier? Matt shrugged. They had never needed to set the alarm. They had always been awakened at five am to…\n\nThey both tore off towards the nursery, but Matt could already guess what they would find.\n\nSara was missing, her window hanging open, and her bassinet empty except for a scattering of feathers.\n\nLisa didn't notice the feathers, but Matt sure did.\n\nYou didn't raise turkeys as long as Matt did without being able to recognize turkey feathers.\n\nMatt nearly bowled his in-laws over as he charged through the door and made his way to the old turkey barn. His father-in-law huffed angrily, but his brother-in-law turned to keep pace with him. He had a nose for when things were wrong, and he could tell that something was off. He and Matt had been friends long before he'd married his sister, and he knew at once that Matt was agitated. They ran to the turkey barn, the one Matt had always seen Old Tom sleep in, but it was empty. Of course, it was empty. All the turkeys were gone now. Matt had gotten rid of them before he killed the last one yesterday.\n\nMatt didn't know why he had thought they would find anything here. He and Lisa had spent the evening cleaning and preparing the turkey after he'd killed it. It was Thanksgiving, after all. That was why Matt had sold all the turkeys in the first place. Sanderson Farms had paid him a rather hefty sum for that many birds, and it had made their transaction with the bank all the smoother. Old Tom, Matt had decided, should die here, where he had lived out most of his life. He would be the family's Thanksgiving meal that year. His final act would be to feed the family he had helped elevate.\n\nThey had put his corpse in the oven before going to bed, and Matt had thought, fondly, that this would be the last turkey he'd ever see outside of a grocery store.\n\nWhen the scream cut across the yard, Matt knew where he should have started his search.\n\nHe could hear Lisa screaming hysterically, her cry high and mournful.\n\nIt sounded like they had found Sara.\n\nWhen Matt came into the farmhouse, Lisa was sobbing on the dining room floor. Matt had never seen her cry like that, and her sorrow shook her whole body. Her eyes fixed on his, and Matt saw a look of intense confusion and mistrust. What had she seen? Why was she looking at him like he had done something? Where had they found Sara?\n\nMatt got his answer when he walked into the dining room.\n\nMatt's mother-in-law was still holding the carving knife. His father-in-law clutched his chest in the corner as a piece of meat lay on the floor in front of him. The turkey sat in the middle of the table, pristine save for the slices on its left side. Matt saw the source of the panic as it protruded from that cavity, and he felt certain he would vomit right there in his mother's once pristine dining room.\n\nThe turkey sat on the table that so many of his mother's Thanksgiving turkeys had graced throughout my childhood.\n\nThe turkey that sat there now profaned her old farm table.\n\nSticking from the cavity in the turkey was a tiny arm. Its flesh had been browned and crisped, its skin marred slightly by the carving knife, but Matt knew who it must be. His legs unhinged, and he fell against the china cabinet, the dishes inside clattering angrily as Matt looked at that arm. It swam before his eyes as his mind tried to unhinge, and Matt passed out amidst the shrieks of his wife and the cries of her family.\n\nMatt woke up on the couch with the police standing over him. \n\nLisa had needed to be taken to the hospital, her shrieking having devolved into a catatonic state. The police were very interested in knowing how Matt's three-month-old daughter had gotten cooked into a turkey and how no one had a clue how it had happened? They took him down to the station and asked Matt question after question after question. They were certain he had done it, but they didn't understand why. Hell, Matt didn't fully understand why at the time.\n\nHe still didn't understand why as he sat in the living room of his childhood home.\n\nHe'd been drinking since they released him. He tipped the whiskey bottle and let the delicious fire fill his mouth as he tried to put out the fire in his guts. He was good and drunk as he watched the fields fall into darkness. Matt wasn't sure he'd be alive in the morning to see the sun come up over them. There's a gun in his other hand, but it wasn't for him. Matt had been watching the field, watching it darken, and he believed he could see something moving growing there. Something was massing in that barren field, cloaked in shadows but still very real. There were eyes in that field, beady red eyes filled with a hatred that Matt knew all too well. Hadn't he seen those eyes as a child? Hadn't his father snatched him away before they could have him? \n\nWell, it looked like they might have him now. \n\nA huge something blocked out the moon as it came through the screen door.\n\nMatt suspected that it might be Old Tom come to end his legacy.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't have Matt's legacy continue in some other way.\n\nMatt supposed what he was thankful for was that he was too drunk and numb to care what corner of hell these turkeys were about to drag him off to."

        "selftext": " \n\nWork Release isn't like an ordinary prison.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with how the prison hierarchy works, let me explain. You have Maximum Security institutions, places with barbed wire on the fences, and men in cages inside concrete structures, whose days are basically dictated by the guards' will. Then you have Minimum Security, which is mostly dorms that look like summer camp cabins, with bunk beds, belongings stacked neatly in lockers, and Inmates who have a schedule and go about their day as they choose, within reason. Then there's Community Custody, which is more like a halfway house. Inmates living in Community Custody have jobs outside the facility, earn their own money, and get to wear regular clothes most of the time. They have one foot in the real world and usually cause very little trouble.\n\nThis post is deemed too dull for most officers, but after three years of running and gunning at Stragview, I was ready for something boring. The Major that runs the Midnight Ridge Work Camp is a friend of mine, you see. He heard I was looking for a change and decided to make me part of his team. So, I put in my transfer, waited my customary three months for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn, and finally got my marching orders. I thought that after three years of hassle and bull crap, I had finally arrived at a sort of early retirement.\n\nI had no idea.\n\nThere are three shifts at work release. First shift handled the morning, the busiest time of the day, and organized the vans and the carpools that took our inmates to work. They monitored their GPS tracking and generally fielded phone calls and questions from the brass or family members. Second shift was responsible for the logistics of bringing everyone home, coordinating arrivals, and making sure that by the time Third shift arrived at eleven, everyone was snug in bed and dreaming about tomorrow's busy day. That's where my shift comes in. Third shift was, by far, the easiest of the three shifts. You sat behind a desk for eight hours and watched the GPS points for the day run by on a big monitor. You monitored recorded phone calls, called in the counts to the control room, and try not to fall asleep. \n\nOther than that, not much happens.\n\nThird shift is also the only shift with just one person at the helm. That's because you don't have to deal with anyone until the sun rises unless there's an emergency. I'd ridden the eleven to seven shift for three months, and I have to say that it was the best post I had ever had. I had to run chow at four am and send three groups of loggers out at five-thirty, but other than that, I rarely ever saw an inmate unless I wanted to.  \n\nThat's probably how I lost my focus.\n\nI was out on a compound check when I first noticed the sound.\n\nEvery night at midnight, I have to walk the compound and make sure everything is locked up. Aside from two dorms, there's a tool shop, a laundry room, a chemical shed, a motor pool, and a lawn shed where we keep the lawn mowers and weed eaters. It's also important to walk around and make sure the grounds are free of garbage or that no one has tried to drop off any \"care packages'' during the day. I've been told that people will sometimes do drug drops when all the inmates are at work, so we walk around periodically and check the drainage ditches and look for turned-up turf that someone's hidden things under.\n\nI was walking the grounds with my headphones on, listening to Spotify as I made my way around the ground, when a harsh noise cut into my music. It sounded like tv static or the high REEE of power lines. I took my headphones off to clean the jack, thinking they were the culprit. When I slid them off, I realized that it wasn't the headphone, though. The sound was coming from the yard. Figuring it was an extra energetic cicada, I kept making my way around as I tried to find the source. \n\nBy the time I had checked the last shed, the noise had stopped. \n\nI walked back in and set about the difficult task of finding something to watch on Youtube in between hourly rounds. \n\nAn hour later, I was sitting with my feet on the desk and listening to a creepy reading when something caught my eye on the security monitors. Most of the compound is wired with cameras. You've got one in the control room, one in the kitchen, one in each dorm, one in each of the shed, and four that sit at various locations around the outside. One of them faces the only road in, another sits on the parking lot, and the other two face the rec yard and the backwoods. I looked at the cameras again, sure I had seen something blip across the back cameras, and nearly flipped my chair when I caught sight of the rec yard cam.\n\nSomeone was standing in the rec yard, right in the middle of the basketball court, looking at the woods.\n\nThe center had once been a Lumber Camp, and it's pretty far back in the woods. There's only one access road, and I hadn't seen anyone drive up to it. We don't get a lot of foot traffic out here, being about 5 miles off the nearest road, but we do get visitors from time to time. The signs on the road are usually enough to deter visitors, so the idea that someone had just walked out of the woods and onto my rec yard this late at night was hard to believe. I unlocked the cage where we kept the shotguns and headed out nonetheless. It wasn't an inmate, they were all locked down for the night, so it had to be someone from outside the camp.\n\nI came out a side door, barrel leading, and peeked around the edge to get an idea of what I was dealing with. They were still there, standing on the blacktop and staring at the woods. They were tall, around six feet, and a hood obscured their face. The spotlight on the court showed me jeans and sneakers, and I began to think it might be a man.\n\nAs I took in his profile and sized him up, I started to hear that same high-pitched buzzing noise. It followed me as I crept quietly to the tool shed, and I had to squint as it seemed to buzz against my fillings. It was worse than before, the sound slinking across my mind like an ice skater, and as I swung around to challenge the man, I could feel my left eye twitching from the noise. I leveled the barrel at him as I challenged him in my loudest voice, the words stilted as the loud REEE raked at me.\n\n\"This is state property. You are not authorized to be here. State your business before I…\"\n\nBefore I pointed my shotgun at an empty basketball court. \n\nI swept the barrel around, trying to listen for footfalls or heavy breathing. The guy had been there one minute and been gone the next, so if he were still here, I should be able to hear him. There was nowhere he could have made it in the two seconds it had taken me to come around the shed, and I was certain he had been there. I had seen him, the camera had seen him, and I started walking around the sheds as I tried to flush him out, challenging him every few minutes as I did so.\n\nIt took a minute to realize that I could have heard him at all because the loud ringing had disappeared from my ears.\n\nThirty minutes later, I had to accept that he had gotten away.\n\nThe cameras, though…\n\nI made my way back to the control room, opening the door with my key, and sat down in front of the camera bank. I should have called Stragview, which is only about a mile up the road, but I wanted something more concrete than my word on it. The fact that he had disappeared had shaken me, and I needed someone else to have seen him. I rolled back the footage by an hour, panning forward slowly as I checked for figures. Maybe the camera would show me where he'd gone too. I could go back out and find him, cover him until backup could get here, and have a little excitement for a change.\n\nWhen I got to the point where I had noticed him on the camera, though, the blacktop was empty.\n\nI kept watching, thinking maybe I had been wrong about the time, but when I rounded the corner with my shotgun a few minutes later, I rewound and looked again. There was no one there, the court was empty until I got there, but I knew I had seen someone on the camera. Hell, I had seen him when I rounded that shed. How could he just not be there now?\n\nThere would be no more youtube for me that night. I bird dogged those cameras, my eyes sliding from screen to screen, trying to catch anything that might vindicate what I'd seen earlier. I knew what I'd seen, I had seen a person out there, but there was nothing there now. The longer I went, though, the more I second-guessed myself. Maybe it had been a shadow. Perhaps I had been seeing things. Maybe I had just wanted there to be something there.\n\nI was looking at the yard when something blipped near the woods. I was used to seeing raccoons or possums as they went about their business, maybe even an owl or a hawk, but whatever this was had been big. I panned around to the other camera and thought I saw a similar large shape lopping around near the woods. It was too big to be a dog, maybe a mastiff, but I suppose it could be a large cat or something. We did get bears and cougar sightings every now and again, but this was too weird on top of the prowler. \n\nWhen the courtesy phone rang, I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\nThe guy on the other end sounded as scared as I was.\n\n\"Officer, it's Tabish in Dorm A. We have a problem out here.\"\n\nThe courtesy phone was how the inmates contacted me after the doors were locked. If one of them had a medical emergency or a fight broke out, that was how they got in touch with me. I had only heard it ring a few times, and mostly it was because I was late opening the door for chow. Today, however, the guy on the other end sounded pretty scared.\n\nAs scared as I felt, in fact.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\"Well, something big ran past the window, like a cougar or something. Now there's something loud on the roof, and it sounds like it's trying to get in.\"\n\n\"The roof? What's on the roof?\" I asked \n\n\"I don't know, sir. It sounds pretty big, and it's…\" but suddenly there was a loud ripping sound from overhead, and I heard Tabish's scream overtopped by the same ringing I had heard earlier.\n\nI slammed the phone into the cradle and picked up my shotgun as I turned towards the dorm. It took two steps for logic to rear its head, and I realized that charging off without letting someone know what was going on was a great way to end up dead. I picked up the phone again, dialing the number for the control room of Stragview and praying that they weren't having some kind of problems as well.\n\nSomeone picked up on the second ring.\n\n\"Stragview Reception Center, control room sergeant Clease speaking.\"\n\nI gave Clease a short rundown on what was happening, and he assured me that he would send some officers around to help me.\n\n\"Just don't leave the control room. Lock the doors, and stay put until we get there. ETA is probably about fifteen minutes, but it could be half an hour. We're are majorly understaffed tonight.\"\n\n\"Do I need to call the police as well? Maybe the…\"\n\n\"No,\" Clease came back quickly and decisively, \"we will handle this. Stay put and don't do anything stupid.\"\n\nThen he hung up, and I could swear I could hear that weird static creeping in again through the lines. I went around and made sure the doors were locked and tried to keep myself from moving towards the back. I was very curious about what was going on in the dorm, and I found myself walking towards the kitchen before thinking better. I should, after all, go, make sure the kitchen was secured. It backed onto the rec yard, and the dorms were beyond that, so if the doors weren't locked, something might get in.\n\nI had slid the key into the lock that separated the offices from the kitchen when I heard the frantic pounding of fists. I threw the door open and saw a handful of scared inmates at the backdoor of the kitchen. They were pounding on the glass hard enough to send cracks through it, and some of them were looking behind them with terrified, jerking glances. Some of them stepped back when they saw the shotgun but pounded with more fervor when they saw I was holding it.\n\n\"Please! Let us in! These things are going to kill us!\"\n\nI glanced out the back window over the drop sink and saw an abattoir spread across the blacktop. The overhead lights near the woods and over the blacktop had burst, casting the whole space in moonlit shadows. I could see large, loping shapes chasing scared inmates in the semi-darkness before burying them and savaging them with huge jaws. Their screams were a cacophony that I was surprised I was only now hearing, and many of them lay dead and bleeding across the blacktop. \n\nIn the middle of it all stood the hooded man. He stood there amidst the chaos, taking it all in mildly from beneath his hood. The beasts moved around him, long chitinous bodies moving gracefully, and I almost sensed his approval of it all. Had he brought them here? Were these his pets? My mind tried to make sense of it all, even as that skeletal reeeing drove an icepick into my skull.\n\nHe turned then, his eyes meeting mine through the window, and I heard the din of screams dim as though it were a bad radio signal. His eyes bore into mine, and I could feel him root around in my brain, like fingers over my scalp. The inmates at the door kept shrieking, but I hardly noticed when something came along and drug them away. Many of the things seemed to be dragging my inmates towards the woods, but the man in the hood commanded my full attention.\n\nWhen he spoke in my head, it didn't even seem odd.\n\n\"We don't want you, Watchman. Sleep, and live to tell your friends what you have seen here. Oh, and be sure to give the Warden a special message for me. Be sure to tell him that Reece sends his regards.\"\n\nWhen he stopped speaking, the loud ringing reached a fever pitch, and I felt warmth trickling down the sides of my head. My knees cut loose, and I split the left knee of my uniform pants as I crashed to the kitchen floor. I was suddenly assaulted by the loudest ringing I had ever heard, and it felt like a bolt of lightning was rocketing through my skull. Fortunately, I didn't have long to suffer. \n\nI blacked out just as my hands came up to try and cover my bleeding ears.\n\nI wasn't aware of anything else until someone slapped me across the face, and I realized I was on the ground.\n\nThey brought me to the prison and tossed me in a holding cell. That's where I awaited the Warden while he compiles a report from the Work Camp. From what I was told by the yard sergeant, a blunt man who came to interrogate me like a freaking inmate, all the inmates at the center were gone. I told him about the things, about the man, the bodies, and the blood out on the rec yard, but he didn't believe me. The sergeant says that they haven't found any blood or bodies there. The only person they found was me, asleep on the floor after making a disturbing call to the prison about someone attacking the work camp. The doors to the dorms were opened, the locks missing, and they expect that there is now a roving band of inmates out in the Stragview Woods.\n\nThe only person that seemed that believed me was the Warden.\n\nWhen I first came here, he met me at the gate, asking me what had happened and what I had seen. I told him everything. I told him about the big creatures, things like hunting cats that had broken into the dorm, and the blips on the camera I'd seen as they moved around. I told him about the phone call from Inmate Tabish, where he told me about the creatures trying to get into the dorm and the static burst as they had made it inside somehow. I told him about the man in the hood, even giving him the message that he had left for him.\n\nThat was when the Wardens carefully constructed cool had evaporated.\n\n\"Hold him until I get back. I will have more questions for him.\"\n\nWhen the sergeant came back about three hours later, though, it was to let me out and inform me I was on disciplinary leave without pay until my punishment could be decided upon."

        "selftext": "Every year, the town would have a massive gathering. Bead necklace vendors, food trucks, and most importantly of all, baked goods. Nana was a cornerstone of the community, culminating in her involvment in the harvest festival. She would sell her famous cookies to the adults, who fawned over how they were unlike any other cookies they’d ever had. But children got unlimited free cookies. Truly, she would make a staggering amount, with tray after tray loaded into the back of a pick-up truck. It became a competition between us on who could eat the most cookies, as Nana never once told a child they’d had enough, She did watch though, as if keeping track.\n\n“Hello, dear,” called out Nana as I passed her house the next day, coming home from school. “Would you like a cookie?”\n\nNormally, stranger danger would be in effect, but this was Nana we are talking about. She’s been a constant in the lives of children in town for as long as anyone can remember.\n\n“S…sure,” I answered reluctantly. “If you don’t mind.”\n\nI was swept into the house, where a tray of cookies was set in front of me.\n\n“Eat as much as you like, as long as you can keep a secret.”\n\n“A secret?” I hesitated “What kind of secret?”\n\nNana’s eyes shifted conspiratorially. “You can come here everyday and have as many cookies as you want, as long as you never tell a soul.”\n\nNow, being the supple 8 year old that I was, I saw no issue in an arrangement in which an unlimited supply of cookies was involved. “I can do that.” I said\n\nSo the arrangement commenced, everyday after school, I would stop by Nana’s and gorge on cookies until I felt sick, then make my way home. The weight gain was subtle at first, but throughout the year, I went through no less than 4 sizes in clothes. My parents, baffled, chalked it up to hormones or some such causing the growth, as my steady diet of cookies remained between Nana and I.\n\nAfter several months, the holidays were upon us again. I began noticing strange utensils and implements being taken out of storage. A huge cast iron pot, old jars labeled in a language I didn’t know, ornate cutlery and spoons, and a weird bucket with a stick coming out of the top. When I asked about them, Nana just said that they were for the harvest festival cookies.\n\nThe next few visits grew increasingly uncomfortable. Nana’s insistence on my cookie consumption, at first charming, now gave the sense of an inarguable command. Growing up to respect my elders, I had no choice but to comply, despite my disgust at the very thought of cookies. Nana would occasionally poke at my side, commenting on how I was coming along well.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, on a chill winter day, something felt off walking up to Nana’s door. I can’t explain it, but to say that there was a rotten feel to the air. The feeling of unease was compounded when Nana opened the front door. She seemed… hungry. \n\nNana smacked her lips and muttered, “I made this cookie special just for you.”\n\nThe cookie in question seemed innocuous enough, however I was hesitant. I took it, and as Nana went to grab something, tossed the cookie into a potted plant nearby. When Nana refocused on me, her smile didn’t make it to her eyes. I took in the scene around me and knew that something was terribly wrong. The large pot on the old fashioned oversized wood stove, the doors wide open and flames licking out at a hectic pace. In the fire, I could see something glinting. It looked like… a pair of wire frame glasses. I froze staring at the blackened metal. I could picture the face that those glasses belonged to. Chubby cheeked from being force fed cookies for an entire year.\n\nPanic set in as puzzle pieces started fitting into place ...no one knew where I was, and last year’s promise to stay silent now felt like a trap. My heart began thudding in my chest, like an engine revving up. Nana’s smile dropped off like a mask, revealing a horrid scowl, and pounced at me, her small wiry frame possessing a disproportionate strength. Flooded with an urge to escape, I pushed back with every ounce of weight I’d gained that year. Nana stumbled back off balance, tripped over the wood pile by the stove, and fell head first into the open oven. An unearthly scream pierced the air, as she flailed impotently, catching fire like dry paper. As the fire began traveling down her body, I awoke from my trance and ran. I ran through the front door, I ran the 3 blocks to my home, and I ran through my front door straight to my mother.\n\nIt took a while for my incoherent screaming to settle into comprehensible words, as I attempted to recount the situation to my mother. Police were called, and before I knew it, detectives, like from the tv shows, were in my living room asking me questions.\n\nThe full details came out a few months later. Police arrived at the scene to find a pile of ash in front of the stove. Twisted frames of wire glasses, brittle child-sized bones turned to ash, a dagger crusted with dark, ancient stains, and the recipe for Nana’s famous cookies.\n\n A pretty run-of-the-mill recipe, save for one key ingredient, written in careful, looping script: Tallow of child."

        "selftext": "Vandalism or iconoclasm or just outright destruction is sometimes compared to murder. It makes sense, when one considers that something like a stained-glass window takes over three thousand hours of skilled labor and immense cost to create. Works of art are invariably unique and signify the progress towards enlightenment of our species. The act of destroying something precious is also significant, plunging us back into the darkness, an act of brutality worthy of being compared to murder.\n\nI might feel more strongly about the preservation of antiquities than most people. I'm sure that if I asked a random person on the street if it would be worse to shatter the thousand-year-old Ru Guanyao or to gun down a random gang member they would say that murder is worse. But is it, though?\n\nWould it be worse to incinerate a Stradivarius or to feed a poisoned hamburger to a Karen that has gotten single mothers fired so that they couldn't pay their rent?\n\nIs murder really worse than destroying objects of great age and beauty that represent the best that humanity can create? Suppose the person being murdered is a terrible nuisance to society, and their assassination purely routine anyway? To me, I find this to be a moral dilemma with a certain answer, because I've spent half a century of my life protecting and preserving rare and priceless objects.\n\nAs a curator, a caretaker, the person of our generation who guards these artifacts, I am part of a legacy. Should one of these objects be sacrificed to save the life of the worst person you have ever met? Is that person's life worth more than the Mona Lisa?\n\nIf you had to choose to save the only copy of your favorite song from a fire, or save the life of the person who abused you in the worst way, honestly, in the heat of flames all around you, which would you choose?\n\nFear can take many strange forms, and we can fear for things much greater than ourselves. We can fear being caught in a moral dilemma, we can fear making choices that will leave us damned no matter what we do. We can fear becoming the destroyer of something we love very dearly, or becoming the destroyer of another human being - becoming a kind of murderer.\n\nIs it murder, to let someone die, when you can intervene?\n\nI say it is, it is murder by inaction, yet we distance ourselves and keep our conscience clean. At least that is how we try to live. Few of us are designed for firefighting or police work or working with people infected with deadly diseases. Anyone could intervene, at any time, to help someone in need, someone who is slowly dying in a tent that we drive past on our way to work. It is easy to excuse ourselves, for we are merely the puppets of a society that values our skills.\n\nEach of us is creating a stained-glass window, with thousands of hours of skilled labor. That is your purpose, not to be distracted by the poor, the addicted, the outcasts, the lepers of our modern world. It is not your job to care for them. But what if all of your work was to be undone? What if all you have made was destroyed?\n\nWhat if you had to destroy everything you worked so hard to achieve, just to save the life of whoever is in that tent by the freeway? You would not do it, I would not do it, we cannot do such a thing. We would make the choice to let someone die, rather than see our work destroyed, rather than be the destroyer of our great work on the cathedral of our society, our wealth, our place in the sun.\n\nIf I am wrong about you then you could go and switch places with the next person holding a cardboard sign to prove it. Take their place and give them all that you have, your job, your home, your bank account, your car and your family. You must do so to prove to me that a stranger's life is worth more to you than the things you own.\n\nThe artifacts I preserve are the treasures of our entire civilization. They belong to all of humanity, so that we are not all suffering in the darkness of ignorance and hatred. They are more ancient and worth more than everything you own and everything you have labored to create.\n\nNow, you are no random person being asked this question. Would you sacrifice one of these ancient artifacts to save a person's life?\n\nI hope you are not offended by such a difficult and twisted sermon. I hope I have made my own feelings clear, so that the horror I experienced can be understood. To me, the preservation of many priceless relics was my life's work, and I fully understood the value, not the just intrinsic, but symbolic value of the items I was tasked with protecting.\n\nIt all began when I opened up the crate holding the reliquary of King Shedem'il, a Nubian dwarf, over four thousand years old. The first thing I noticed, with great outrage, was that the handlers had damaged the brittle shell, the statue part of the mummy. I was trembling, holding the crowbar I had used to pry open the lid of the crate. In shipment they had mishandled him and broken the extremely ancient artifact.\n\nHave you ever gotten something you ordered from Amazon and found it was damaged inside the box, probably because it was dropped - and felt pretty angry or frustrated? Whatever it was, it could be replaced, it was just something relatively cheap, something manufactured in our modern world. This object belonged to a lost civilization - one-of-a-kind.\n\nKnights Templar had died defending this amid other treasures. Muslim warriors had died protecting it from Crusaders. The very slaves who carried this glass sarcophagus into the tomb were buried alive with it. During the end of World War II, eleven Canadian soldiers with families waiting for them back home had died during a skirmish in a railway outside of Berlin while capturing this object under a pile of other museum goods. One of those men was my grandfather, and he reportedly threw himself onto a grenade tossed by a Nazi unwilling to surrender the treasure.\n\nYour Amazon package can be replaced, but imagine the magnitude of outrage you would feel if it had the history of the damaged package I was looking at. I was holding the crowbar, and it was a good thing none of the deliverymen were present.\n\nHave you ever felt so angry that when you calmed down you started crying?\n\nWhile I was wiping away a tear I felt something was wrong. It was hard to say, at first, what that was, exactly. I had just undergone an outrageous emotional roller coaster, and it was hard to attribute my sense of wrongness to anything else.\n\nIn the curating of antiquities, there is a phrase for when we apply glue to something, we call it \"Conservation treatment.\"\n\nShedem'il was due for some conservation treatment. I wheeled the crate into the restoration department. It is always dark and quiet where I work, and even if there are dozen people in the building, you never see anyone.\n\nI came back the next night - as museum work is done at night for a variety of reasons. One of them is security, another is to allow access to other people during the day, and lastly there is a genuine tradition of the sunless, coolness of night that probably started with moving objects of taxidermy to their protective display. It is at night that the museum comes to life, in a way, since that is when things get moved around.\n\nAlthough one does not see their coworkers in such a place, it can still be noticeable when they start to go missing. Fear crept into me, because I knew something was wrong. The horror of what was happening is just one kind of terror, and I was quite frightened when I discovered what was going on.\n\nI was sitting in the darkened cafeteria alone, eating my lunch, when I looked up and saw the dark shape leaning from behind a half-closed door. I blinked, staring in disbelief at the short monster, with his empty eye sockets covered in jeweled bandages, stuck to the dried flesh that still clung to his ancient skull. It is something so horrible and impossible, that my mind rejected it as reality.\n\nOur mummy had left his encasing, and now roamed freely.\n\nWe do not know enough about Shedem'il to know exactly what might motivate such a creature to do what it did. As the museum staff went missing, it became apparent to me that Shedem'il was responsible.\n\nI saw strange flashing and heard a disembodied voice chanting. When I looked around a corner, I saw the workspace of someone who was suddenly gone, and the creature retreating out of sight, around another corner. Shedem'il did not want to be seen by me, and had only made that one appearance, staring at me, studying me, and then vanishing.\n\nIn part I did not believe what I was feeling, the primal dread of a dead thing cursing the living. I was able to deny what I had seen, I was able to continue to work, although always looking over my shoulder in the dark and quiet place. The empty museum, where guards and staff had vanished one-by-one.\n\nDenial is an unbelievably powerful tool. One could deny that my story is true, easily imagine that it is impossible. It was not more difficult for me to disbelieve what I had seen, I was able to tell myself it was impossible.\n\nNow I know I have made myself clear, that I would not trade the life of a person for a precious artifact. What I discovered was far worse than the loss of a person's life. Somehow, the mummy had taken them bodily - soul included, and trapped them in a state of timeless torture. This is different.\n\nI would not wish this fate on anyone, it is not mere death, and no object is worth a person's soul. To me, the soul of one person, be it me or you or the worst person you can imagine is non-negotiable. One soul for all of us, what happens to one person's soul is the burden of all. That is also something I know is true.\n\nSeeing these artifacts as I have, when the sun is silently rising outside, through the stained glass, I know there is but one soul of all humankind. While our individual lives might be somewhat expendable, the soul of one person is the same as any other.\n\nI know you would trade everything for the person you love the most. You would burn down the whole museum for just one more day with the person you love the most, and I would not blame you. That is because the person you love the most is the soul of humanity for you.\n\nNow let yourself see that all of humanity, is loved in that way, when we speak of our singular soul. Whatever happens to one person's soul is what happens to all of us, our entirety. That is the enlightenment that these objects represent, the truth they spell out for us, the reason they must exist.\n\nBut in the face of even one person's soul being trapped by evil, no object on Earth is worth anything.\n\nI came to see this, to hear this, to feel this. I was filled with ultimate horror, far beyond what I can describe the feeling of. I psychically understood the evil being channeled through the animated corpse of Shedem'il. I also knew that I was saved for last. My soul would be the final one taken, and then the creature would be free to leave the house of artifacts.\n\nTo roam the Earth and trap countless victims into material things. Untold suffering would be unleashed. Shedem'il's victims all knew this, and they cried out to me from their prisons. I had no choice to make.\n\nI went to the shipping area and looked for a suitable tool. I hoped that by destroying the precious artwork they were trapped inside, the curse might be broken, and the people trapped inside set free.\n\nI found the crowbar and was about to get to work when I noticed a signed Louisville slugger from some famous baseball player. I hefted it, feeling the spirit of its owner still lingering in the relic. Then I set it down, seeing the sledgehammer of John Henry.\n\nWith the heavy tool in my hands I crept through the silent halls of the museum, avoiding the darkness. I was terrified that the mummy would find me, and all would be lost to its evil. Sweating and trembling I found the first imprisoned coworker.\n\nI put one hand on the priceless statue of Mary, knowing it had become a vessel of a trapped soul, and feeling how its purpose was corrupted for evil. \"May God forgive me.\"\n\nI lifted the hammer and struck it, over and again until it was smashed to smithereens. Old Bobby, the security guard, materialized beside me. He was shaking and crying and terrified. I knew how he felt, I was horrified both by the nightmare at-hand and the grim duty of undoing the ultimate evil upon us.\n\n\"Get it together, we have work to do. You must watch my back for that little monster while I do the rest.\" I told him, hearing how insane it all sounded.\n\nWe went throughout the museum, as dawn approached, tearing apart a Rembrandt, turning a Stradivarius into kindling, shattering ancient pottery and pulverizing a sculpture we referred to as our own Pietà.\n\nWith is magic spent and victims released, we stood together before the horrifying little mummy, and watched it crumble into dust.\n\nSuddenly the alarms in the museum went off, and it wasn't long before the police arrived. The owner was quick to have me held responsible and also firing Old Bobby and several others. While I was in jail for seventeen months, I considered how I might articulate myself when I got out.\n\nI have gotten over both the horror of what happened and the actions I took. There is one little thing still bothering me though. I look back on how the deliverymen were not there at-all. I never saw them.\n\nI wonder what happened to those guys."

        "selftext": "\"Hey, you live at the Murphy Farm, right?\"\n\nI looked up, not sure I had heard them.\n\nNo one had ever actually talked to me before, so it was a little weird to have it happen.\n\nI'm a farm kid. My Dad is called Farmer Murphy, though that's not actually our name. He bought the Murphy Farm, the one hundred and twenty acres of farmland containing two cow barns, a large chicken shed, an orchard, and several fish ponds. Dad makes quite a bit of money working the farm, enough to afford a small army of hands, and we've run about three pumpkin patches already this year. With that kind of money, Dad thought it would be fitting to send me to a private school. Maybe he thought I could get the kind of education that would allow me to be more than a farmer, maybe he thought I would have a head for business and take the farm to new heights, but whatever he had hoped, it didn't leave me a lot of room for making friends.\n\nI'm not an unpersonable person, I don't keep to myself or bully people or anything, but the kids at the private school know my Dad is a farmer, they can smell the cow crap on my boots and they see me work the pumpkin patch when they come to get their jack o lanterns. They laugh at me behind my back, call me Jethro, and think I must be dumb and simple. This leads most of them to shun me or ignore me, and that's about how I've spent the last two months since we moved here.\n\nUntil now, it seems.\n\n\"Uh, yeah,\" I said, looking up from my notebook.\n\n\"Told you,\" said a blond girl. I thought her name might be Rose or Lily or something like that, but the kid who had asked if I lived on Murphy Farm was Derrick. Derick was the one who called me Abner and pretended to smell crap on my boots even when they were clean, \"Well, hey, we were wondering if we could see it. We're really interested in farming, aren't we guys?\"\n\nThere were five of them, two girls and three boys, and they were smiling way too big. Derrick was part of the student council, the girl that was either Lily or Rose and the other girl (Hellen, maybe?) were cheerleaders. The other two were Stan and Guthrie, guys on the football team and pseudo-bullies. They had certainly bullied me enough, though not physically. I was a big guy, too much time spent bucking hay and dragging a hoe, but they didn't mind picking on me.\n\nThis was the most genial conversation we had ever had, actually.\n\n\"Since when?\" I asked, looking between the five of them distrustfully.\n\nDerrick sighed as his smile slipped a little, \"Okay, okay, we really just need someone to say it's okay for us to be out there at dusk. We wanna do the Corn Man Challenge, and your Dad has the only one for about thirty miles.\n\nIt was my turn to roll my eyes, \"You know that's fake, right? There's no real Corn Man.\"\n\n\"Well duh,\" Guthrie said, \"We aren't babies. We just want to do it for TikTok. They've been going viral lately, and we want to see if ours will too.\"\n\nI didn't really do TikTok much, I was usually listening to audiobooks or something on my phone if I was out working in the field, but even I had heard about this one. The Corn Man was an old legend that had blown up recently, and kids were making videos in fields of themselves standing as still as scarecrows while they sang the creepy little song to summon him. He never came, of course, but some of them were supposed to be kind of spooky. The legend said that if you could prove to the Corn Man that you could stand still in the face of his horrible visage then he must grant you a wish, but it was all superstitious nonsense. You might as well ask the milk cow for wishes than some Corn Man.\n\nEven so, though, I supposed maybe I could work this to my advantage.\n\n\"Hmmm, I dunno,\" I said, putting on the hockey accent I sometimes used, \"I'd have to run the tractor when you got done so there wouldn't be any footprints in the corn. The tractor gas is a little expensive,\" I pretended to think about it, \"I couldn't run it for anything less than fifteen bucks a head.\"\n\nThey had their phones out before I even finished, asking for my cash app ID so they could send me the money. I'm not as stupid as they think, and, of course, I have a Cash app. I'd had my eye on a couple of new games and seventy-five dollars would get me a long way toward them. I nodded as the money was received, Derrick actually labeling it tractor gas, and I told them I would meet them at the edge of the east field at five thirty that afternoon.\n\n\"The sun will just be setting then, so it'll give you time to set up before it gets low.\"\n\nThey agreed and as they went away, chattering quietly, I sent out another text, preparing for this evening.\n\nI met them at five-thirty-five that afternoon by the east field, surprised they had known which one to come to.\n\nSometimes city people got turned around.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said, disappearing into the corn, \"It isn't far.\"\n\nDerrick told me to hang on, the girls complaining that they didn't know they would have to wander through the corn. I didn't, just made my way to a spot near the left edge of the field and took a seat on a big rock. The spot was a little weird. No matter what Dad did to it, nothing would grow here. The rock was there to mark it, and as they came out of the corn and saw the little fifteen-by-fifteen-foot spot they started squawking about how it was perfect. One of the girls had a tripod, her Cashapp ID had said Lilyrose so maybe I had been right on both parts, and they set up a phone as they tried to find the right angle.\n\nI just sat on the rock and watched them, looking at the sun as it rode lower and waiting for them to begin.\n\n\"Okay,\" Derrick said, \"Let's all join hands and get started.\"\n\nThe other girl (turned out her name was Heather) pressed something in her hand and they began.\n\n*Corn man, corn man, come to me if you can,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, I can stand as the corn stalks can.*\n\n*Corn man, Corn man, still as stone, not like a man,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, still and quiet as the corn stalks can.*\n\nThey chanted the words then they stood stalk still in the corn field. The plants waved, giving no notice to the five high school kids who stood like statues in their midst. It was silly. Cornstalks didn't stand still at all. Whoever had come up with this story had clearly never spent a lot of time around corn.\n\n\"Nothing's happening,\" Hellen whispered.\n\n\"Give it a minute,\" Derrick whispered back.\n\n\"How long does it take?\" Stan whispered, but before Derreck could answer they heard a rustling sound in the cornfield.\n\nI lay on my rock, staying still, and listened to the rustle of something moving amidst the corn plants.\n\n\"Is that him?\" Lilyrose asked.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Derrick hissed, \"You're supposed to be still.\"\n\nThey stayed there as the sun set, the stalks rustling like insects around them, and suddenly it stepped from the corn like a phantom.\n\nHe was huge, nearly seven feet tall, and he was a mass of burlap sacks and chains. He had an axe in one hand and a cleaver in the other, and the hockey mask over his face made him look grizzly indeed. His boots galumphed with crusty mud, and he swung his head from side to side as he took in the kids standing in the field.\n\n\"It's the Corn Man!\" Derrick shouted, immediately breaking his advice from a moment ago and staggering back a step.\n\n\"You...you said he wasn't real!\" Heather gibbered, breaking into a run.\n\n\"I...I didn't,\" but whatever Derrick did or didn't know was lost as the Corn Man bellowed like a bull and charged them.\n\nThey all broke and ran, the corn shaking as they slammed into it and ran in the direction they had come. No one stayed to get their wish, no one remembered that was why they had come there, and as someone grabbed the camera they knocked the tripod over and did not come back for it. They were yelling and screaming all the way to their car, none of them giving a care for their guide, but I didn't mind.\n\nThe Corn Man swung his head in my direction as I began to laugh, and as he staggered toward me, I clapped my hands slowly.\n\n\"Great job, Travis. You're getting pretty good at this.\"\n\nHe lifted the mask, smiling as he held his burlap-covered hand out for his cut, \"It is pretty fun to watch them city kid pee their pants and run away.\"\n\nI slapped a ten spot into his hand and we headed for the house as Mom rang the bell by the back door, \"After two months of being made fun of and thought of as the Stupid Farm Kid it is pretty nice to watch them get their comeuppance.\"\n\nWe stomped through the corn, the stalks parting easily, and Travis looked at the setting sun unhappily.\n\n\"Hey, cous, you ain't scared the real Corn Man will get mad at you for makin' fun of him, are ya?\"\n\n\"Travis, don't tell me you actually believe in the Corn Man. He's just a story, he isn't real.\"\n\n\"Nu-uh, my Daddy says,\"\n\n\"Travis, your Daddy is a drunk who claims he met Big Foot in Branson Missouri. He is far from a reliable source.\"\n\n\"But he says he believes in him, and that means he has to be real, right?\"\n\nIt was hard to believe, sometimes, that Travis was a year older than I was. Travis was seventeen and HUGE for his age. The local high schools were trying to get him to play Football, same as they did every year, but Travis and Uncle Zeke were our best hands, and Dad really couldn't spare Travis so he could \"Toss a ball around\". Zeke depended on his son's added pay so he could properly pickle himself too, so he didn't push the matter.  \n\n\"Travis, don't believe everything your old man says. Sometimes you have to come up with your own ideas about things, ya know?\"\n\nTravis chewed that over as we came into the barn, leaving his costume in the barn before we went in for dinner.\n\nOkay, so, my early comments may have been a little disingenuous.\n\nI didn't lie, I've always been the big (supposedly) dumb farm kid, at least for the two months I’ve been at this school, but just here recently I've become more approachable by my peers. Derreck and his friends are about the fourth group that has paid for the pleasure of having the shit scared out of them in Dad's cornfield, and I expected they wouldn't be the last. The first group that had approached me had been pure coincidence. Travis had come whistling through the fields as they stood stalk still and they had bolted in fear before he even came out of the corn. After that, I had cut him in, put together a costume, and he blundered into every Corn Man summoning from then on.\n\nIt's not technically a lie. People pay more than what I charge for haunted houses, and I have certainly been cashing in given the time of year. People expect a scare around Halloween, they crave it, and I'm just giving them what they want. I think, deep down, they know there's no Corn Man, but it's the adrenaline rush that draws them in. I'm just providing the ambiance.\n\nDerrick's video went up the next day and did very well. He even tagged Murphy Farm in it, which was nice. He seemed surprised when I was in class the next day, and I had to explain to him that I had stayed still, like you were supposed to, and the Corn Man had gone away. That seemed to work, he nodded as he thought about it, and I went back to my assignment as the rest of the class joked about Derrick and his run-in with the legendary Corn Man.\n\nI got approached by a new group at lunch, four guys from the football team, who wanted to go see this Corn Man too. I told them I would need to run the stalk lifter, something that ran on diesel and was kind of pricey, and they shelled out twenty bucks a head for the privilege of using the field. I laughed to myself, eighty dollars richer, and when a new shadow fell over my lunch, I looked up to find the last person I had expected.\n\n\"Hey, I, uh, heard you can summon the Corn Man. I was hoping I could tag along too.\"\n\nMargery Stokes was not someone I would have thought would fall for all this Corn Man nonsense. Margery was here on an academic scholarship, one of five given every year, and her grades reflected. Like me, however, she wasn't from the usual student background, and the others picked on her. We weren't friends, I don't think we had ever shared so much as a class together, but I did know of her.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"Why, did you want to set up a time?\"\n\n\"I was hopin I could tag along with those guys from earlier. I want to see what there is to this Corn Man thing.\"\n\n\"Well, it's generally twenty dollars a head, but I was mostly just gouging those guys. For you, I'd do ten, just don't tell anyone.\"\n\nShe nodded, reaching into her purse and pulling out a twenty.\n\n\"I can pay. Where and when do I meet you?\"\n\nI slid the twenty into my pocket, respecting her desire for fairness.\n\n\"Six by the east field. It's the one with all the corn in it, you can't miss it.\"\n\nShe told me she would be there and walked quickly off to get her own lunch.\n\nI shot a text to Travis, telling him we had more people looking for the Corn Man and he said he'd be there.\n\nI smiled as I chewed, happy business was so booming, and reflecting it would kind of suck to go back to being the big dumb farm kid once Halloween was over. It would suck, but I wouldn't mind returning to being a nobody either. Having a full social calendar was kind of a pain, and it was only a matter of time before Dad noticed what I was doing and put a stop to it.\n\nUntil then, though, let there be Corn Man.\n\nThe sun was sinking below the corn as a little red hatchback pulled up along the fence line and I saw Margery hop out and adjust her cardigan.\n\n\"Am I late?\" she asked, not seeing anyone else.\n\nAbout that time I heard the exhaust of a large F250 as it came into view and shook my head, \"Nope, looks like you're early.\"\n\nThe four burly football players piled out, giving Margery a questioning side eye, and I told them to follow me as we headed into the corn. They came along noisily, talking and joking as they pushed the corn aside, and when the five of them had come into the field, the biggest one turned and tossed me his phone.\n\n\"You got the recording, right?\"\n\nI nodded and lined up the shot, the four of them laughing as Margery came to join them. They were all very cavalier about the whole thing, but I noticed that Margery was almost shaking with anticipation. She was quiet, almost stoic, and as they took their positions she seemed ready to fight to get what she wanted. I lined up the shot, telling them to start when they wanted, and the five of them began to chant as the corn swallowed the last long line of the sun behind the stalks.\n\n*Corn man, corn man, come to me if you can,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, I can stand as the corn stalks can.*\n\n*Corn man, Corn man, still as stone, not like a man,*\n\n*Corn man, corn man, still and quiet as the corn stalks can.*\n\nThe ritual completed, they stood there like statues as they waited for the coming of the Corn Man.\n\nI sat too, holding the phone as I recorded them, and the glowing remains of the sun behind them looked pretty cool. This would definitely make a great video. I hoped they remembered to tag the farm in it, but as I sat there, watching them twitch and glance around, something felt different this time. The crickets were silent, the night birds had gone still, and I was suddenly aware of how absolutely noiseless the world was. It's rare to be in the field at night and hear nothing, and it made me think of something my Dad had told me on a hunting trip once.\n\n\"When the birds and bugs go quiet, it usually means something big is around. Something big and something bad.\"\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief when the corn began to rustle. There he was, I thought, as the stalks shook and the assembled kids began to shudder. He was later than usual, but the big oaf sometimes forgot that he was supposed to be there. Travis could be flaky, but I was glad he hadn't forgotten our arrangement.\n\nWhen the thing broke free of the corn, I knew in an instant that it wasn't Travis.\n\nThis thing was made of cornstalks and roots, its arms were wound together plant fibers, and its legs were thick and muscled with the bulging veins of vegetation. Its face looked like a pagan idol, the features made of delicate silk and weathered cornstalks, and the eyes blazed at the assembled children like the coals of a fire.\n\n\"Holy shit! What the fuck is that?\" one of them shouted, and the thing turned its head to look at him about a second before one of those arms came up and wrapped itself around him. I heard his bones break, his skin tear, and his final horrified screams were cut off as he was torn to pieces. The others ran then, the three football players sprinting into the corn, but I was frozen to the spot on top of my rock. I watched as it went after them, my eyes locked on the bloody remains of the kid whose name I had never bothered to learn, and from the rock, I heard the thing as it caught them. They screamed like trapped animals, their fear and their pain a living thing, but as I looked up, I noticed that someone hadn't run.\n\nMargaret was still there, her cardigan spattered in blood and her face full of terror, but she refused to move. She was stalk still, her chest barely rising, and when I glanced down, I remembered that I was recording. The kid's phone had caught all of it, and as the thing came stomping back, I tried to keep everything in frame so I could prove I'd had no part in this. At least one person had been torn to shreds on my Dad's land, and I was not about to go to prison for some psycho that had been hiding in my East field.\n\nAs it came lumbering out of the field, it looked at Margaret and made its laborious way over to her. To her credit, she never moved, though I could see the tears sliding down her face as they joined the gore there. It stood far taller than it had any right to be, its body blocking the light of the moon as it fell across her, and seemed to judge her with those living coal eyes.\n\n\"You have proven thyself worthy of my boone, child. What do you ask of the Corn Man?\"\n\nHer voice shook only a little, but I still heard it from my rock.\n\n\"Please, my mother has cancer. Cure her, I beg you. She's all I have in this world. Please, take her cancer from her and let her live.\"\n\nThe Corn Man nodded his head slowly, and it sounded like trees bending in the wind, \"Granted,\" he whispered and as he disappeared into the cornfield I could see the red running off him and hear the creak of the stalks as he vanished.  \n\nThe police found the bodies of Trevor Parks, Nathaniel Moore, and Gabriel and Michael Roose in the field that night. Dad was pretty mad when he learned what I had been doing, but the video cleared me of any involvement in the deaths. Travis had, thankfully, been busy in the cowshed with a particularly fussy milk cow and had remembered that he was supposed to be the Corn Man about ten minutes after sunset. He had actually met Margaret and I as we came out of the field, and I had to stop her from screaming as he came lumbering up with half his costume on. The police took the phone and the official report stated that some psycho had been creeping around, found us in the field, and decided to kill everyone but Margaret and I for some reason. Dad forbade me from doing anything like that in the fields again and I agreed, pretty done with anything related to the Corn Man after that.\n\nA couple of days later, after I had been asked about a thousand questions by the police, Margaret came to sit with me at lunch.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, and I was a little confused as to what she was thanking me for.\n\n\"For?\"\n\n\"My mom got the call today. They have to run a bunch of new tests, but the cancer is gone. She had a tumor in her brain the size of my thumb and it's just gone.\"\n\nWe sat in silence after that, neither of us saying it but both of us thinking the same thing.\n\nIt would appear that Margaret had gotten her wish from the Corn Man after all."

        "selftext": "I've worked construction since dropping out of college, so about twenty years. I know most people don't think much of it, but if you haven't shivered in the night lately then thank a construction worker because we probably built the thing that's keeping the elements out. It's not glamorous work, but I have managed to claw my way up the ranks till I have my own crew, run my own job sites, and live pretty comfortably.\n\n\n\nAfter twenty years, I've noticed that there are constants in this industry, but only three standouts, hard hats, lunch pails, and porta johns. Job sites and Porta potties go together like a hand in a glove. They are always necessary, always terrible to get stuck in for long periods of time, and always seem to smell both sterile and like a horse manure field. In twenty years I've been inside more porta potties than I have women, and, unfortunately, I think some of the shitters were cleaner.\n\n\n\nThis particular time was a little different, a lot different, and it's something that sticks with me to this day.\n\n\n\nIt's been weeks, months even, and I still wake up sometimes in a cold sweat as I see that thing and hear it grind its teeth together.\n\n\n\nI'm getting ahead of myself, lemme start from the beginning.\n\n\n\nWe were working on these new apartments, one of those big old buildings with about eight units per floor and about fifteen floors that are wedged between another one that's mostly the same thing. I was sipping my fifth cup of coffee when I heard the ominous rumble from my guts and knew what was coming. I'd had two breakfast burritos from Dollies, she's an angel but she goes heavy on the peppers, a whole pot of coffee, a hashbrown as big as a pretzel, and now it was all coming to a head. The guy showing me the blueprints for the building looked at me with real worry and asked if I needed to take a minute. I told him it was fine, but he got about halfway through telling me about a problem with the wiring when it happened again.\n\n\n\nI gritted my teeth, that one might as well have been a starting pistol, and I told him I'd be right back.\n\n\n\nI made it to the lift just before the doors closed, and the guys who were taking it down looked worried as my stomach growled like a V8 with a bad carburetor.\n\n\n\n\"Too many of Dollie's spicy chorizos, boss? said one of the guys at my elbow, and I nodded as the sweat started standing out.\n\n\n\n\"It's fighting with the pot of coffee and the hashbrown in there, and it's anybody's bet who'll win.\"\n\n\n\n\"Remind me not to follow you into the john,\" he said with a laugh as the lift came to the ground floor.\n\n\n\nI was out and looking for one of the blue boxes that marked our porta potties. There were about five of them on-site, and it wasn't long before I found one of them over by the office. I was waddling now, trying not to lose it right here in the yard, and the guys were laughing as I came ponderously toward my oasis in the desert.\n\n\n\nI closed the door, pushed the black locking bar, and had my pants down and my ass over the hole before I could embarrass myself further. I checked for paper and was glad to find some, not always a given, and as the pressure began to relieve itself in the worst way possible, I closed my eyes and sighed happily. I'll save you the messy details, but, needless to say, I was glad when it was finally over.\n\n\n\nI took out my phone, giving it some time to see if there was any more business to conduct, and that's when I became aware of the strange sound. At first, I thought I might not be done, but I realized pretty quick that the slight splashing noise wasn't me. It was like something was making ripples in the water, splashing up a little as it sturred below, and I wondered if maybe I had dropped off a big enough payload to still be stirring as it sank.\n\n\n\nWhen it splashed again, this one high enough to wet my nethers with cold, dirty water I stood up quickly. That had definitely been something alive splashing around in there, and I must have looked pretty silly just standing there, pants around ankles, as I stared into the hole. I fumbled at my phone, trying not to drop it in as well, and bent low so I could see into the fallow pit.\n\nIt was hard to tell at first, the murky blue water looked like a subterranean lake more than anything, and the murky light in there wasn’t helping matters one bit. I wondered if a snake had gotten in, maybe something bigger, and that was when I noticed something round coming out of the water.  \n\n\n\nAs it rose, I recognized it for what it was; the top of a very bald head. \n\nThe tips of ears were sticking up from the surface of the muck, and as it rose I could see the beginning of eyes as well. They were open, staring, and utterly devoid of anything human. I stumbled back, nearly falling down as my feet tangled in my pants, and bumped hard against the door as the whole thing shook on its base.\n\n\n\nWhat the hell was that, I wondered? Had some homeless guy gotten into our shitter? Had some freak gotten down there with nasty stuff on his mind? I didn’t know, but what I did know was that I was locked in here with him. I reached for the lock, the light from my phone held forward so I could see, and when I heard a splash, I turned back in a hurry.\n\n\n\nThe light from my phone fell across the opening, and the head that rose from it looked like some kind of creature from one of the old stories my friends and I had told to spook each other with when we were younger. Its skin was inky, though that could have more to do with where it was residing. Its ears were long and pointed, like a bat, and its eyes were white like the full moon. It rose from the festering swamp like a vampire from some old movie, its body simply rising without any kind of mechanism to lift it. I wasn't sure if it was tall or capable of levitation or something, but as its face came fully over the lip toilet lid, I saw the worst of it.\n\n\n\nIts mouth was stretched into a perpetual grin, its teeth long and sharp as they fit together like puzzle pieces. As neatly as they came together, they still appeared to be too big for its mouth. They looked like they might be painful to it, the grin more of a grimace than anything, and they were gravel gray and slimy with something more vicious than saliva. In the dim light of the little toilet, it rose up to tower over me. It kept rising, its head nearly brushing the ceiling, and I could see that its arms and legs were, indeed, longer than expected. They were nearly twice as long as its body, the hands ending in cruel claws. It leered at me, reveling in my fear, and I was paralyzed by that fear.\n\n\n\nThe creature was terrifying, but I don't think that was all of it. There are certain places where we seem to believe we have the illusion of safety. Your home, your bed, the bathroom, places you are at your most vulnerable and comfortable. You think of these places as safe, as sanctuaries, and when that space is violated it feels like a violation of your person.\n\n\n\nIt opened its mouth, giving me a good look at those gravel-gray fangs, and as it hissed softly, it leaned forward like it was getting ready to strike.\n\n\n\nI don't know how I did it, I shouldn't have been able to move at all, but my hand seemed to come up all on its own and flick the plastic bar back that was holding the door closed.\n\n\n\nI went from cowering on the floor of a filthy porto-potty stall to scrambling across the yard of the job site, the light flooding in as it sent the creature shrinking back into its dark hole.\n\n\n\nI had crab-walked about twenty feet when I realized that I hadn't had time to pull my pants up and was scrambling half-naked across a job site with hundreds of people on it. I didn't think all of them were watching me, but way more eyes than I wanted were there. I jerked my pants up and started yelling about some kind of animal being in the porta-potty. Some of the guys ran over to investigate, others came to see if I was okay, but ultimately they found nothing. I told them, told the authorities when they got there too, that something had been in the tank and it had come at me spitting mad. They got somebody out there to drain it, but they didn't find anything. I hadn't expected they would.\n\n\n\nWhatever it was, it had gone back to hiding in the muck.\n\n\n\nI had the unit closed down and told the vendor that he could come and get it.\n\n\n\nHe offered to bring a new one, but that didn't help.\n\n\n\nI do my business off-site now, but I will remember that grinning, dripping, terrible face for as long as I live."

        "selftext": "There are two rules you must always adhere to in order to survive in this forest.\n\n1. Never get into a situation where there is no light\n\n2. Only the sunlight can be trusted\n\nThat was what the legends said when they spoke of the infamous Umbra Woods. I tried doing some research before my trip, but I couldn't find much information other than those two rules that seemed to crop up no matter what forum or website I visited. I wasn't entirely sure what the second one meant, but it seemed to be important that I didn't find myself in darkness during my trip, so I packed two flashlights with extra batteries, just to be on the safe side. \n\nI already had the right gear for camping in the woods at night, since this was far from my first excursion into strange, unsettling places. I followed legends and curses like threads, eager to test for myself if the stories were true or nothing more than complex, fabricated lies.\n\nThe Umbra Woods had all manner of strange tales whispered about it, but the general consensus was that the forest was cursed, and those who found themselves beneath the twisted canopy at night met with eerie, unsettling sights and unfortunate ends. A string of people had already disappeared in the forest, but it was the same with any location I visited. Where was the fun without the danger?\n\nI entered the woods by the light of dawn. It was early spring and there was still a chill in the air, the leaves and grass wet with dew, a light mist clinging to the trees. The forest seemed undisturbed at this time, not fully awake. Cobwebs stretched between branches, glimmering like silver thread beneath the sunlight, and the leaves were still. It was surprisingly peaceful, if a little too quiet.\n\nI'd barely made it a few steps into the forest when I heard footsteps snaking through the grass behind me. I turned around and saw a young couple entering the woods after me, clad in hiking gear and toting large rucksacks on their backs. They saw me and the man lifted his hand in a polite wave. \"Are you here to investigate the Umbra Woods too?\" he asked, scratching a hand through his dark stubble.\n\nI nodded, the jagged branches of a tree pressing into my back. \"I like to chase mysteries,\" I supplied in lieu of explanation. \n\n\"The forest is indeed very mysterious,\" the woman said, her blue eyes sparkling like gems. \"What do you think we'll find here?\"\n\nI shrugged. I wasn't looking for anything here. I just wanted to experience the woods for myself, so that I might better understand the rumours they whispered about. \n\n\"Why don't we walk together for a while?\" the woman suggested, and since I didn't have a reason not to, I agreed.\n\nWe kept the conversation light as we walked, concentrating on the movement of the woods around us. I wasn't sure what the wildlife was like here, but I had caught snatches of movement amongst the undergrowth while walking. I had yet to glimpse anything more than scurrying shadows though.\n\nThe light waned a little in the darker, thicker areas of the forest, but never faded, and never consigned us to darkness. In some places, where the canopy was sparse and the grey sunlight poured through, the grass was tall and lush. Other places were bogged down with leaf-rot and mud, making it harder to traverse.\n\nAt midday, we stopped for lunch. Like me, the couple had brought canteens of water and a variety of energy bars and trail mix to snack on. I retrieved a granola bar from my rucksack and chewed on it while listening to the tree bark creak in the wind. \n\nWhen I was finished, I dusted the crumbs off my fingers and watched the leaves at my feet start trembling as things crept out to retrieve what I'd dropped, dragging them back down into the earth. I took a swig of water from my flask and put it away again. I'd brought enough supplies to last a few days, though I only intended on staying one night. But places like these could become disorientating and difficult to leave sometimes, trapping you in a cage of old, rotten bark and skeletal leaves.\n\n\"Left nothing behind?\" the man said, checking his surroundings before nodding. \"Right, let's get going then.\" I did the same, making sure I hadn't left anything that didn't belong here, then trailed after them, batting aside twigs and branches that reached towards me across the path.\n\nSomething grabbed my foot as I was walking, and I looked down, my heart lurching at what it might be. An old root had gotten twisted around my ankle somehow, spidery green veins snaking along my shoes. I shook it off, being extra vigilant of where I was putting my feet. I didn't want to fall into another trap, or hurt my foot by stepping somewhere I shouldn't. \n\n\"We're going to go a bit further, and then make camp,\" the woman told me over her shoulder, quickly looking forward again when she stumbled. \n\nWe had yet to come across another person in the forest, and while it was nice to have some company, I'd probably separate from them when they set up camp. I wasn't ready to stop yet. I wanted to go deeper still. \n\nA small clearing parted the trees ahead of us; an open area of grass and moss, with a small darkened patch of ground in the middle from a previous campfire. \n\nNearby, I heard the soft trickle of water running across the ground. A stream?\n\n\"Here looks like a good place to stop,\" the man observed, peering around and testing the ground with his shoe. The woman agreed.\n\n\"I'll be heading off now,\" I told them, hoisting my rucksack as it began to slip down off my shoulder.\n\n\"Be careful out there,\" the woman warned, and I nodded, thanking them for their company and wishing them well. \n\nIt was strange walking on my own after that. Listening to my own footsteps crunching through leaves sounded lonely, and I almost felt like my presence was disturbing something it shouldn't. I tried not to let those thoughts bother me, glancing around at the trees and watching the sun move across the sky between the canopy. The time on my cellphone read 15:19, so there were still several hours before nightfall. I had planned on seeing how things went before deciding whether to stay overnight or leave before dusk, but since nothing much had happened yet, I was determined to keep going. \n\nI paused a few more times to drink from my canteen and snack on some berries and nuts, keeping my energy up. During one of my breaks, the tree on my left began to tremble, something moving between the sloping boughs. I stood still and waited for it to reveal itself, the frantic rustling drawing closer, until a small bird appeared that I had never seen before, with black-tipped wings that seemed to shimmer with a dark blue fluorescence, and milky white eyes. Something about the bird reminded me of the sky at night, and I wondered what kind of species it was. As soon as it caught sight of me, it darted away, chirping softly. \n\nI thought about sprinkling some nuts around me to coax it back, but I decided against it. I didn't want to attract any different, more unsavoury creatures. If there were birds here I'd never seen before, then who knew what else called the Umbra Woods their home?\n\nGradually, daylight started to wane, and the forest grew dimmer and livelier at the same time. Shadows rustled through the leaves and the soil shifted beneath my feet, like things were getting ready to surface.\n\nIt grew darker beneath the canopy, gloom coalescing between the trees, and although I could still see fine, I decided to recheck my equipment. Pausing by a fallen log, I set down my bag and rifled through it for one of the flashlights.\n\nWhen I switched it on, it spat out a quiet, skittering burst of light, then went dark. I frowned and tried flipping it off and on again, but it didn't work. I whacked it a few times against my palm, jostling the batteries inside, but that did nothing either. Odd. I grabbed the second flashlight and switched it on, but it did the same thing. The light died almost immediately. I had put new batteries in that same morning—fresh from the packet, no cast-offs or half-drained ones. I'd even tried them in the village on the edge of the forest, just to make sure, and they had been working fine then. How had they run out of power already?\n\nGrumbling in annoyance, I dug the spare batteries out of my pack and replaced them inside both flashlights. \n\nI held my breath as I flicked on the switch, a sinking dread settling in the pit of my stomach when they still didn't work. Both of them were completely dead. What was I supposed to do now? I couldn't go wandering through the forest in darkness. The rules had been very explicit about not letting yourself get trapped with no light. \n\nI knew I should have turned back at that point, but I decided to stay. I had other ways of generating light—a fire would keep the shadows at bay, and when I checked my cellphone, the screen produced a faint glow, though it remained dim. At least the battery hadn't completely drained, like in the flashlights. Though out here, with no service, I doubted it would be very useful in any kind of situation.\n\nI walked for a little longer, but stopped when the darkness started to grow around me. Dusk was gathering rapidly, the last remnants of sunlight peeking through the canopy. I should stop and get a fire going, before I found myself lost in the shadows.\n\nI backtracked to an empty patch of ground that I'd passed, where the canopy was open and there were no overhanging branches or thick undergrowth, and started building my fire, stacking pieces of kindling and tinder in a small circle. Then I pulled out a match and struck it, holding the bright flame to the wood and watching it ignite, spreading further into the fire pit. \n\nWith a soft, pleasant crackle, the fire burned brighter, and I let out a sigh of relief. At least now I had something to ward off the darkness.\n\nBut as the fire continued to burn, I noticed there was something strange about it. Something that didn't make any sense. Despite all the flickering and snaking of the flames, there were no shadows cast in its vicinity. The fire burned almost as a separate entity, touching nothing around it.\n\nAs dusk fell and the darkness grew, it only became more apparent. The fire wasn't illuminating anything. I held my hand in front of it, feeling the heat lick my palms, but the light did not spread across my skin.\n\nWas that what was meant by the second rule? Light had no effect in the forest, unless it came from the sun? \n\nI watched a bug flit too close to the flames, buzzing quietly. An ember spat out of the mouth of the fire and incinerated it in the fraction of a second, leaving nothing behind.\n\nWhat was I supposed to do? If the fire didn't emit any light, did that mean I was in danger? The rumours never said what would happen if I found myself alone in the darkness, but the number of people who had gone missing in this forest was enough to make me cautious. I didn't want to end up as just another statistic. \n\nI had to get somewhere with light—real light—before it got full-dark. I was too far from the exit to simply run for it. It was safer to stay where I was.\n\nOnly the sunlight can be trusted.\n\nI lifted my gaze to the sky, clear between the canopy. The sun had already set long ago, but the pale crescent of the moon glimmered through the trees. If the surface of the moon was simply a reflection of the sun, did it count as sunlight? I had no choice at this point—I had to hope that the reasoning was sound.\n\nThe fire started to die out fairly quickly once I stopped feeding it kindling. While it fended off the chill of the night, it did nothing to hold the darkness back. I could feel it creeping around me, getting closer and closer. If it wasn't for the strands of thin, silvery moonlight that crept down onto the forest floor and basked my skin in a faint glow, I would be in complete darkness. As long as the moon kept shining on me, I should be fine.\n\nBut as the night drew on and the sky dimmed further, the canopy itself seemed to thicken, as if the branches were threading closer together, blocking out more and more of the moon's glow. If this continued, I would no longer be in the light. \n\nThe fire had shrunk to a faint flicker now, so I let it burn out on its own, a chill settling over my skin as soon as I got to my feet. I had to go where the moonlight could reach me, which meant my only option was going up. If I could find a nice nook of bark to rest in above the treeline, I should be in direct contact with the moonlight for the rest of the night. \n\nHoisting my bag onto my shoulders, I walked up to the nearest tree and tested the closest branch with my hand. It seemed sturdy enough to hold my weight while I climbed.\n\nTaking a deep breath of the cool night air, I pulled myself up, my shoes scrabbling against the bark in search of a proper foothold. Part of the tree was slippery with sap and moss, and I almost slipped a few times, the branches creaking sharply as I balanced all of my weight onto them, but I managed to right myself.\n\nSome of the smaller twigs scraped over my skin and tangled in my hair as I climbed, my backpack thumping against the small of my back. The tree seemed to stretch on forever, and just when I thought I was getting close to its crown, I would look up and find more branches above my head, as if the tree had sprouted more when I wasn't looking.\n\nFinally, my head broke through the last layer of leaves, and I could finally breathe now that I was free from the cloying atmosphere between the branches. I brushed pieces of dry bark off my face and looked around for somewhere to sit. \n\nThe moonlight danced along the leaves, illuminating a deep groove inside the tree, just big enough for me to comfortably sit.\n\nMy legs ached from the exertion of climbing, and although the bark was lumpy and uncomfortable, I was relieved to sit down. The bone-white moon gazed down on me, washing the shadows from my skin. \n\nAs long as I stayed above the treeline, I should be able to get through the night.\n\nIt was rather peaceful up here. I felt like I might reach up and touch the stars if I wanted to, their soft, twinkling lights dotting the velvet sky like diamonds. \n\nA wind began to rustle through the leaves, carrying a breath of frost, and I wished I could have stayed down by the fire; would the chill get me before the darkness could? I wrapped my jacket tighter around my shoulders, breathing into my hands to keep them warm. \n\nI tried to check my phone for the time, but the screen had dimmed so much that I couldn't see a thing. It was useless. \n\nWith a sigh, I put it away and nestled deeper into the tree, tucking my hands beneath my armpits to stay warm. Above me, the moon shone brightly, making the treetops glow silver. I started to doze, lulled into a dreamy state by the smiling moon and the rustling breeze. \n\nJust as I was on the precipice of sleep, something at the back of my mind tugged me awake—a feeling, perhaps an instinctual warning that something was going to happen. I lifted my gaze to the sky, and gave a start.\n\nA thick wisp of cloud was about to pass over the moon. If it blocked the light completely, wouldn't I be trapped in darkness? \n\n\"Please, change your direction!\" I shouted, my sudden loudness startling a bird from the tree next to me. \n\nPerhaps I was simply imagining it, in a sleep-induced haze, but the cloud stopped moving, only the very edge creeping across the moon. I blinked; had the cloud heard me?\n\nAnd then, in a tenuous, whispering voice, the cloud replied: \"Play with me then. Hide and seek.\"\n\nI watched in a mixture of amazement and bewilderment as the cloud began to drift downwards, towards the forest, in a breezy, elegant motion. It passed between the trees, leaving glistening wet leaves in its wake, and disappeared.\n\nI stared after it, my heart thumping hard in my chest. The cloud really had just spoken to me. But despite its wish to play hide and seek, I had no intention of leaving my treetop perch. Up here, I knew I was safe in the moonlight. At least now the sky had gone clear again, no more clouds threatening to sully the glow of the moon.\n\nAs long as the sky stayed empty and the moon stayed bright, I should make it until morning. I didn't know what time it was, but several hours must have passed since dusk had fallen. I started to feel sleepy, but the cloud's antics had put me on edge and I was worried something else might happen if I closed my eyes again.\n\nWhat if the cloud came back when it realized I wasn't actually searching for it? It was a big forest, so there was no guarantee I'd even manage to find it. Hopefully the cloud stayed hidden and wouldn't come back to threaten my safety again.\n\nI fought the growing heaviness in my eyes, the wind gently playing with my hair.\n\nAfter a while, I could no longer fight it and started to doze off, nestled by the creaking bark and soft leaves.\n\n\nI awoke sometime later in near-darkness.\n\nPanic tightened in my chest as I sat up, realizing the sky above me was empty. Where was the moon? \n\nI spied its faint silvery glow on the horizon, just starting to dip out of sight. But dawn was still a while away, and without the moon, I would have no viable light source. \"Where are you going?\" I called after the moon, not completely surprised when it answered me back.\n\nIts voice was soft and lyrical, like a lullaby, but its words filled me with a sinking dread. \"Today I'm only working half-period. Sorry~\"\n\nI stared in rising fear as the moon slipped over the edge of the horizon, the sky an impossibly-dark expanse above me. Was this it? Was I finally going to be swallowed by the shadowy forest? \n\nMy eyes narrowed closed, my heart thumping hard in my chest at what was going to happen now that I was surrounded by darkness. \n\nUntil I noticed, through my slitted gaze, soft pinpricks of orange light surrounding me. My eyes flew open and I sat up with a gasp, gazing at the glowing creatures floating between the branches around me. Fireflies. \n\nTheir glimmering lights could also hold the darkness at bay. A tear welled in the corner of my eye and slid down my cheek in relief. \"You came to save me,\" I murmured, watching the little insects flutter around me, their lights fluctuating in an unknown rhythm. \n\nA quiet, chirping voice spoke close to my ear, soft wings brushing past my cheek. \"We can share our lights with you until morning.\"\n\nMy eyes widened and I stared at the bug hopefully. \"You will?\"\n\nThe firefly bobbed up and down at the edge of my vision. \"Yes. We charge by the hour!\"\n\nI blinked. I had to pay them? Did fireflies even need money? \n\nAs if sensing my hesitation, the firefly squeaked: \"Your friends down there refused to pay, and ended up drowning to their deaths.\"\n\nMy friends? Did they mean the couple I had been walking with earlier that morning? I felt a pang of guilt that they hadn't made it, but I was sure they knew the risks of visiting a forest like this, just as much as I did. If they came unprepared, or unaware of the rules, this was their fate from the start.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, knowing I didn't have much of a choice. If the fireflies disappeared, I wouldn't survive until morning. This was my last chance to stay in the light. \"Um, how do I pay you?\"\n\nThe firefly flew past my face and hovered by the tree trunk, illuminating a small slot inside the bark. Like the card slot at an ATM machine. At least they accepted card; I had no cash on me at all.\n\nI dug through my rucksack and retrieved my credit card, hesitantly sliding it into the gap. Would putting it inside the tree really work? But then I saw a faint glow inside the trunk, and an automated voice spoke from within. \"Your card was charged $$$.\"\n\nWait, how much was it charging?\n\n\"Leave your card in there,\" the firefly instructed, \"and we'll stay for as long as you pay us.\"\n\n\"Um, okay,\" I said. I guess I really did have no choice. With the moon having already abandoned me, I had nothing else to rely on but these little lightning bugs to keep the darkness from swallowing me.\n\nThe fireflies were fun to watch as they fluttered around me, their glowing lanterns spreading a warm, cozy glow across the treetop I was resting in. \n\nI dozed a little bit, but every hour, the automated voice inside the tree would wake me up with its alert. \"Your card was charged $$$.\" At least now, I was able to keep track of how much time was passing. \n\nSeveral hours passed, and the sky remained dark while the fireflies fluttered around, sometimes landing on my arms and warming my skin, sometimes murmuring in voices I couldn't quite hear. It lent an almost dreamlike quality to everything, and sometimes, I wouldn't be sure if I was asleep or awake until I heard that voice again, reminding me that I was paying to stay alive every hour.\n\nMore time passed, and I was starting to wonder if the night was ever going to end. I'd lost track of how many times my card had been charged, and my stomach started to growl in hunger. I reached for another granola bar, munching on it while the quiet night pressed around me. \n\nThen, from within the tree, the voice spoke again. This time, the message was different. \"There are not enough funds on this card. Please try another one.\"\n\nI jolted up in alarm, spraying granola crumbs into the branches as the tree spat my used credit card out. \"What?\" I didn't have another card! What was I supposed to do now? I turned to the fireflies, but they were already starting to disperse. \"W-wait!\"\n\n\"Bye-bye!\" the firefly squeaked, before they all scattered, leaving me alone.\n\n\"You mercenary flies!\" I shouted angrily after them, sinking back into despair. What now?\n\nJust as I was trying to consider my options, a streaky grey light cut across the treetops, and when I lifted my gaze to the horizon, I glimpsed the faint shimmer of the sun just beginning to rise.\n\nDawn was finally here.\n\nI waited up in the tree as the sun gradually rose, chasing away the chill of the night. I'd made it! I'd survived!\n\nWhen the entire forest was basked in its golden, sparkling light, I finally climbed down from the tree. I was a little sluggish and tired and my muscles were cramped from sitting in a nook of bark all night, and I slipped a few times on the dewy branches, but I finally made it back onto solid, leafy ground. \n\nThe remains of my fire had gone cold and dry, the only trace I was ever here. \n\nChecking I had everything with me, I started back through the woods, trying to retrace my path. A few broken twigs and half-buried footprints were all I had to go on, but it was enough to assure me I was heading the right way. \n\nThe forest was as it had been the morning before; quiet and sleepy, not a trace of life. It made my footfalls sound impossibly loud, every snapping branch and crunching leaf echoing for miles around me. It made me feel like I was the only living thing in the entire woods.\n\nI kept walking until, through the trees ahead of me, I glimpsed a swathe of dark fabric. A tent? Then I remembered, this must have been where the couple had set up their camp. A sliver of regret and sadness wrapped around me. They'd been kind to me yesterday, and it was a shame they hadn't made it through the night. The fireflies hadn't been lying after all.\n\nI pushed through the trees and paused in the small clearing, looking around. Everything looked still and untouched. The tent was still zipped closed, as if they were still sleeping soundly inside. Were their bodies still in there? I shuddered at the thought, before noticing something odd.\n\nThe ground around the tent was soaked, puddles of water seeping through the leaf-sodden earth.\n\nWhat was with all the water? Where had it come from? The fireflies had mentioned the couple had drowned, but how had the water gotten here in the first place?\n\nMildly curious, I walked up to the tent and pressed a hand against it. The fabric was heavy and moist, completely saturated with water. When I pressed further, more clear water pumped out of the base, soaking through my shoes and the ground around me.\n\nThe tent was completely full of water. If I pulled down the zip, it would come flooding out in a tidal wave.\n\nThen it struck me, the only possibility as to how the tent had filled with so much water: the cloud. It had descended into the forest, bidding me to play hide and seek with it.\n\nWas this where the cloud was hiding? Inside the tent?\n\nI pulled away and spoke, rather loudly, \"Hm, I wonder where that cloud went? Oh cloud, where are yooooou? I'll find yooooou!\" \n\nThe tent began to tremble joyfully, and I heard a stifled giggle from inside. \n\n\"I'm cooooming, mister cloooud.\"\n\nInstead of opening the tent, I began to walk away. I didn't want to risk getting bogged down in the flood, and if I 'found' the cloud, it would be my turn to hide. The woods were dangerous enough without trying to play games with a bundle of condensed vapour. It was better to leave it where it was; eventually, it would give up. \n\nFrom the couple's campsite, I kept walking, finding it easier to retrace our path now that there were more footprints and marks to follow. Yesterday’s trip through these trees already felt like a distant memory, after everything that had happened between then. At least now, I knew to be more cautious of the rules when entering strange places. \n\nThe trees thinned out, and I finally stepped out of the forest, the heavy, cloying atmosphere of the canopy lifting from my shoulders now that there was nothing above me but the clear blue sky. \n\nOut of curiosity, I reached into my bag for the flashlights and tested them. Both switched on, as if there had been nothing wrong with them at all. My cellphone, too, was back to full illumination, the battery still half-charged and the service flickering in and out of range. \n\nDespite everything, I'd managed to make it through the night.\n\nI pulled up the memo app on my phone and checked 'The Umbra Woods' off my to-do list. A slightly more challenging location than I had envisioned, but nonetheless an experience I would never forget.\n\nNow it was time to get some proper sleep, and start preparing for my next location. After all, there were always more mysteries to chase. \n\n"

        "selftext": "\nLittle to no information exists online relating to the Phanes Accelerator, what does remain relates directly to the 1998 situation, I seek to expand on this giving an overview of the events as best I can. Through my digging I’ve come to find that even early into its construction things about the project seemed off. \n\nBefore construction even began the area chosen to house the accelerator has played host of a number of strange occurrences and natural disasters. A farmer who lived on the property back in the 40s was struck by lightning 17 times, a tourist from Italy wandered away from a tour group and ended up caught in bailor, and of course the many tales of UFO encounters. \n\nIn 1996 construction began on the Phanes accelerator in Athens. The project was funded by Plutus Robotics (Atomic Research Division) and was staffed by students from The National Technical University of Athens. \n\nConstruction and later experimentation was overseen by Dr. Ceres head of the Atomic research division of Plutus Robotics. Dr. Ceres had something of a history of shady dealings both with the Koios University of Science & Technology lab fire in 1975, and the Oxford neutrino beam money laundering debacle. \n\nDuring the presentation given to the Administrative Board of NTUA by The Plutus Robotics representative, reportedly only a series of slides depicting several illegible highly ornate hand written letters were shown. \n\nMembers of the Administrative Board would later go on to claim they had been shown detailed diagrams of the lengthy safety measures taken to protect their students, yet no two of these accounts agree upon what those safety measures were. \n\nMany reports of strange activity on the construction cite were made by civilians, one such story is particularly striking in retrospect. Amongst others and at the time 22 year old Alexia Drakos, claims to have seen flickering spectral lights moving like figures across the cite several months before the project was to publicly announced. \n\n“They were blue, floated just off the ground moving like billows of smoke, they burnt everything they came in contact with, leaving behind scorched lines where they passed”. Alexia Drakos August 17th 1997. \n\nHopes were high that this state of the art piece of equipment would firmly establish Greece as a central and key figure in the future of particle physics. As Phanes was a superconducting cyclotron accelerator expectations were placed firmly in the realm of rare isotope production, however very little progress was made in this area. \n\nOn September the 14th of 1997 the accelerator would claim its first victim, when a member of the construction team was startled by a sudden and unexpected puff of compressed air, and bumped a canister of liquid nitrogen. The pressurized canister burst resulting in severe cold burns and frostbite across 30% of his body. The anonymous man lost all 10 of his fingers along with an ear and a portion of his nose. \n\nNo comment by the man was made, as Plutus Plutus was quick to step in with a settlement deal. This was only the first instance of the mega conglomerate stepping in to moderate the situation, later offering the other survivors similar deals, notable neither of which accepted. \n\nIn the days after multiple staff members reported seeing flickering anomalies on the monitors, specifically light blue or violet luminous smoke. These signings were paired with often heard faint whispers always just out of hearing range without any detectable origination point. \n\nOn December the 7th of 1997 the first test run of the accelerator was performed. During this fairly routine head to head proton collision the first of the accidents would occur. An unexpectedly large and sudden spike of gamma radiation 15 times the amount expected or normally accounted for would surge through the system nearly 10 minutes after the proton collision. \n\nThis surge happened in a layer of the collider wall not fully insulated, resulting in serval people in it’s pathway getting mildly irradiated. While no serious injury occurred the incident was unprecedented, setting *putting\/leaving the entire research team on edge. \n\nDr. Ceres was notably not concerned pushing the team to get back to work as soon as possible to do another run insisting the situation was all “a sensor error”. Though of course this would not the be the last accident. \n\nSeveral non eventual tests were run, 2 more with protons, and once again with neutrons. The results although slightly anomalous were within normal range, giving the team a sense of false safety. \n\nEven with this reassurance things would still continue to get weirder, with Dr. Ceres becoming withdrawn, shutting down discussions and frantically working on the notes for an unnamed project. Serval members of the research team made note of strange and surreal dreams they experienced in the weeks leading up to the event. \n\nOn January the 24th 1998 the Phanes Superconducting Cyclotron Accelerator was turned on for the final time. This is where reports become more widely available and clear in their statements. \n\nThe following is compiled from official reporting as well as the firsthand account by Drs Elizabeth Quinn, and Marco Barlos.\nNothing about the fourth test run was routine, safe, or approved. Dr. Ceres along with the main research team members had locked themselves in the control center for the accelerator actively fighting off attempts to enter. Dr. Ceres then instructed the team to arrange themselves into a closed circle around a small glass prism. \n\nNeither of the survivors can explain why they were so willingly *willing to go along with such a reckless plan, stating that at the time they’d been utterly convinced that Dr. Ceres knew best. Both survivors maintain that they were given a written invitation to a gathering at the accelerator, though only serval illegible cards were ever recovered. \n\nDr. Ceres proceeded to fire up the experiment. The accelerator was never intended on being a used for heavy ion collisions, yet would be gold ions would be used. The collision is hypothesized to have been the first to create a quark plasma though no reading data survived the disaster. \n\nUpon the collision survivors describe a resounding boom like a thunderclap, accompanied by the room shaking, lights flickering out, and multiple electronics in the room sparking and shorting out.\n\nThe entire nearby electrical grid has burst due to a large electrical surge. The research team however did not find themselves in total darkness. The room was lit by a sudden almost blindingly bright *blinding flash of blue light. \n\nThe brilliant azure glow would continue to linger, Cherenkov radiation illuminating the team of researchers. A billion particles breaking the airs light barrier causing excess energy being shed in the form of blue light. The light seemed to emanate from the crystal prism, casting the room in flickering shadows. \n\nEach member of the team was subject of extreme doses of radiation, most dying within days of the exposure. The gamma rays tore through their DNA, leaving their cells unable to replicate, giving them a slow the miserable death of rotting alive. Slowly their cells liquifying away until the lines between life and death blur together. \n\nEven the two longest living survivors suffering minor radiation poisoning and burns. Each going onto have multiple extending complications including a rare form of leukemia which would go on to claim the life of Dr. Barlos. \n\nBut this would not *be the end of the ordeal, several minutes after the initial collision a section of the coolant system would break, weakening the structural momentum integrity of the accelerator. This was followed by an inexplicable explosion which blew out the northeastern side of the lab, doing almost two million dollars worth of damage. Notably instead of an explosion, both survivors describe the arrival of “visitors”. \n\n(Excerpt from interviews)\n\n“There was no explosion, We were all in a state of shock, no one dared to move or even breath, Dr. Ceres was manic ranting and raving about calculations, throwing objects around, even hitting serval of us across the face. That’s when they arrived.” \n\n“They? Who are they? You’ve alluded to another party before.” \n\n“The ones who watch, they look in on us from the outside, I think they were disappointed.” \n\n“I’m sorry but I’m not sure I follow?”\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t understand, you can’t. You’ll just discount this as the result of radiation poisoning, or a concussion like the rest do.” Dr Elizabeth Quinn December 9th 2004. \n\n“It wasn’t long after Ceres lost it that those things came, but no, no, I can’t, I can’t talk about it, they’ll know, they’ll come back.” Dr Marco Barlos October 17th 2001. \n\nNo further information is available about what happened during the incident, in all 9 of the 12 researchers died within a week, of the remaining 3 two are our survivors, and well, the other Dr. Ceres, was never found after the incident, seemingly having disappeared into thin air, leaving behind a journal full of illegible scrolling blue cursive writing.\n\nThe cite was demolished and paved over, later having a small garden center built over it. To this day reports of strange activity in the area continue, electronics acting oddly, the sound of distant muffled whispers, and some reports of ghostly blue flashes of light. \n\nIn the aftermath of the destruction of the facility, Plutus Robotics would step in paying for the majority of the damages, along with offering settlements to the survivors and families of the dead. Making the statement that \n\n“We in no way consider this a failure, merely a setback”. \n\n"

It was quite normal for the first few weeks until we started hearing stractching onnthe doors to our bedrooms every night (we never own any dogs at the time). It got worse when my parents lefted to go to do some important work while i went to my grandmas house from my moms side. I had an older sister at the time and she stayed with my grandma from my dads side. My grandma from my dads side stayed with a few of my cousins, older sister, and my aunt. My sister was playing at the time and my family is shaman including some family from my dads side. My cousins and older sister were playing barbie and they saw a ghost girl. My cousins were scared and said that there was a meow there (my cousins were taught to say 'meow' instead of 'ghost'). My sieter on the other hand was pointing and was saying out loudly that there was a ghost. That scared my cousins, grandma, and aunt. They never wanted to babysit us ever again after that."

        "selftext": "I could have flown home, but I thought a drive would clear my head.\n\nI’d just finished four years in the Marines, four of the messiest years of my life. I had made the mistake of bringing my new wife to California with me and returned from Iraq to find her warming someone else’s bed. The bed in question was of a fellow Marine, someone left on base while I fought and bled for my country. After six months of staying on base so I could meet with lawyers and finish my divorce, I was officially out and done.\n\nWhen I told my dad that I was going to rent a car and drive home, he understood. I told him I needed to come back slow so I could clear my mind, and he told me to drive safe. “Take your time, kid. We'll be here when you get back,” he said and I took him up on it. I was coming cross country, California to Tennessee, and I was seeing the sights and taking in the local flavor. I had decided to make this a long overdue vacation.\n\nI did a lot of thinking on that trip, but my only mistake was picking the kid up.\n\nI was driving through Oklahoma, enjoying the sights and feeling like I could watch the hills and valleys roll by forever, when I saw the kid standing there with his thumb out. He was young, couldn’t have been old enough to enlist, despite his army coat. It was July, the heat stifling, but he was wearing fatigues and a service jacket that looked antique. A breeze ruffled his hair, pushing it back in a harsh puff that made me think of kids blowing on dandelion fluffs. Maybe it was the jacket or maybe it was the look of naked want on his face, but I pulled up beside him and rolled the window down.\n\n“Hey kid, you need a lift?”\n\nHe turned his perfect sky blue eyes to me, and I’ll never forget his words. \n\nI sometimes hear them in my sleep.\n\n“I sure do. Can you give me a lift to McMan, mister? God will thank you if’n ya do.”\n\nI thought that was a little weird, but I told him to climb in and he did so gladly.\n\nThe signs told me McMan was about thirty miles up the road, and I expected the kid to chatter like a squirrel the whole way. To my surprise, he was quiet, his eyes closed and his head bowed for the first couple of minutes. It took me a second to realize he was praying, and when he finished, he sat up and plastered a half daffy grin on his face. \n\n“God tell ya I was a straight shooter?” I asked, more to break the ice than anything.\n\n“He said to thank you for your assistance, Mr. You will be greatly rewarded in his kingdom.”\n\nI nodded, thinking I could use all the help I could get. The farther we drove, the more I began to suspect that something was off about the kid. He stared forward the whole way, his blue eyes on the horizon, and his mouth seemed set in an eternal grin. He wasn’t as young as I’d thought, maybe eighteen or nineteen, and the jacket had the name Harris stenciled on it. It was covered in patches too, the kind you get for service, and I was glancing at one on his left breast when I saw the bulge under the coat.\n\nI felt a cold shudder run through me as I recognized it.\n\nThe kid was packing!\n\n“You look a little young for the service, kid,” I said, trying to disuade some of my fears,“Your brother give you that jacket? Was he in Iraq like me?”\n\n“My dad left it to me when he died.” the kid said matter of factly.\n\n“Sorry to hear that. Was he in Iraq?”\n\n“The Gulf War,” he said, his voice not matching the grin “He enlisted before it started and was there for a couple years after it ended.”\n\nI nodded, “I bet he had some stories. I was in,”\n\nI had been about to start on one of my Sand Box Tales, but the kid cut me off suddenly with the last thing I expected.\n\n“Do you believe in God, Mister?”\n\nI blinked, the subject unexpected.\n\n“Not really, kid.” I answered, being honest, “I’m an atheist, have been ever since what happened to me overseas. I think that, if there is a God, it’s pretty crummy of him to let us live here like this.”\n\nI had expected a fight, but the kid just nodded.\n\n“He forgives you for that. Daddy was like you, Momma said, before he went to war. He saw something over there, bad things, and he came back from the war looking for God. He said he had seen some things over there that scared him and made him want to be better, and he couldn't do better without some help. So, he came back and started looking for a purpose, and he found one. He found a lot of people offering purpose, but only one who delivered. By the time I was born, he was part of the Family.”\n\nI listened politely, not wanting to interrupt the kid, but the way he was talking about his dad's search for God made me a little concerned.\n\nIt didn’t seem like a happy memory.\n\n“I was born into the Family. Father Marcus was our everything, our teacher, our preacher, our second father, and our salvation. He brought lots of people together, lots of lost people, but that wasn’t enough. Father Marcus wanted more. He had plans, big plans, but they wouldn't turn out be so good for us.”\n\nHe was quiet for a minute, looking out the glass and seeming lost in thought. I thought again that he had to be a kid, couldn't be out of high school, but maybe it was just whatever was wrong with him. Even though his eyes looked like he was in the worst pain imaginable, he still wore that plastered-on grin that never reached those eyes. He was like a doll with a troubled owner, a doll that smiles through its destruction.\n\n“When I was ten, Father Marcus told the congregation that the end times were coming. He told them that the government was going to come down and take everything that we had built here, that the Devil was set against us and we needed to escape. He told everybody to sell their things, bring the bare minimum, and come to a place that he had found. It was a farm on the outskirts of town, a big farm that had once been a dairy. They gave him their money so that he could secure their paradise, free from anything that the government or the devil or anybody else might do, and came there to start their new lives. We were hopeful that this would be our paradise, but it wasn’t a paradise. In the end, it was a prison.”\n\nI felt a chill run up my spine as he said that. I wanted to tell him to stop. I didn’t want to hear the end of it, but instead, I just listened. The kid was hurting, that was clear enough, but his story was so captivating. It was like one of those true crime stories, the ones so bad that you just know it has to be true. I kept my eyes on the road and listened, just letting him tell it, already knowing that it wouldn’t have a happy ending.\n\n“We were basically his slaves. We worked in the fields, we took care of the animals, we kept the big house, where he lived, and did his bidding. Father Marcus came down to spit the hellfire every night and to pass down new edicts and rules. Men were not permitted in the big house. No one but Father Marcus could lay with a woman, even within a marriage. All children were Father Marcus's children, but his actual children were special. Eventually,he took all the women that he liked up to the house to \"populate the earth\". He took my sister up there with him, and we never saw her again. People didn’t like it much, but what could they do? Father Marcus was keeping us safe from the apocalypse, right? So we followed his orders, until everything fell apart.”\n\nWe rolled into the outskirts of McMan then, the farms and barns making me think of the place the kid was talking about. I wondered, suddenly, where we were going, and why the kid wanted to go to McMan so badly? Every mile felt like an eternal march, and I was dreading coming to the end of the journey.\n\n“Where,” I started but the kid seemed to be expecting my question.\n\n“Stay on the Main road, mister” he said, clearing his throat before going on. He seemed as dry as an old stick, and when I reached behind the seat and offered him a coke from the cooler, he took it with a smile. I wondered why I had done that? I didn’t want the kid to go on, but in a way I did. I needed the end of it, I needed to know how it had all shook out. I was a curious bastard, it seemed, and I needed to see the bodies in this kids path.\n\n“Then one day, he gathered us in the barn and told us that the end was near. He told us we needed to prepare ourselves to go, because we were meeting God tonight. He gave us all something to drink, something in a red cup that his wives dipped out, and we all drank it. No one argued, no one fought him. We were all so brainwashed that we would have jumped in front of the six fifteen train that ran near the farm if he’d asked. Everyone drank, everyone obeyed, and everyone went to sleep. They stayed asleep too, except me. I woke up in the hospital with tubes in my arms and my wrists secured to the bed. The police were there, one of them waiting in the room with me, and they had questions. It turned out that they were the ones who had been coming, not God. They had arrived to find everyone dead, fallen around the barn like dolls, but had managed to get there in time to save me. I don't know why I lived while everyone else died, and it ate me up for a long time. Father Marcus, my family, everyone was gone, and I had been left behind. No one wanted anything to do with me, my Dad had burned a lot of bridges before we went into the Family, and none of them wanted to take in a moody sixteen year old who'd just been through hell. So I went into the system, going from group home to group home, until a couple weeks ago.”\n\nI clutched the wheel hard, suddenly very worried about what we might find in McMan. The town was coming up now, a nice old brick town that looked downright picturesque. We passed a sign for a new Mega Church, the Sunrise Gospel House, and there was a smiling old guy beaming down from the front. The kid shot a glare at him, and patted his heart, inevitably patting the piece as well.\n\nI suddenly wondered who was in McMan that this kid needed to see?\n\n“I was watching TV in the group home and an ad came on for a church. The church had recenly aquired its own network, and the pastor of the church was very familiar. He spoke about peace and God's love, but all I could hear was the voice that told us to drink the juice and go meet God. As I watched him smiling and hugging people, I heard a very different voice in the back of my mind. It was God, the real God, and he told me what I had to do. He said I needed to be his sword, and I needed to cleave the unrighteous from his midst.”\n\nHe patted the gun again, whispering a prayer to God, and my hair stood up on the back of my neck as something strange and strange wafted from the kid.\n\nAt that moment, he felt very righteous. \n\nWe were well into town now, rolling up Main Street, and he told me to stop. I dropped the kid off at the light, and he thanked me, saying he could make it from here. He gave me a real smile then, not the doppy one he'd been wearing the whole way through his sad little tale, and waved at me.\n\n“God bless you, mister. I'm off to do his work.”\n\nThen he was gone, and I sat there watching him go until someone politely honked behind me and I was forced to roll along. \n\nI wasn’t sure what to do as I made my way out of town. Did I tell someone? If this pastor had really messed the kid up like that, then maybe he had it coming. Was that really my call to make, though? In the end, I called the McMan police department and told them what I suspected. I told them about the kid and the story he had spilled, but I don’t think they took me seriously. The dispatcher seemed like the report was going in a little pile of crackpot shit, but I felt I had done my due diligence.\n\nI was still thinking about it when I stopped for the night, wondering where the kid was and what he was doing as I drifted off to sleep.  \n\nI woke up the next day and turned on the news to see that Pastor Michael Wheeler of the Sunrise Gospel House had been shot in front of his congregation. The Pastor, someone wanted by the FBI for his alleged connection to several past cults, had been shot by someone from one of his past religious orders. The kid was in custody, but police were already saying he was mentally unwell and this was likely a retaliation slaying. Police were still looking for a mysterious caller who had tipped them off before the shooting, and they had many questions for that individual.\n\nI left Oklahoma as quickly as I could, flinching every time I saw a cop.\n\nThat was a couple of years ago, and I've never told anyone what happened on that trip home. \n\nIt's something that's weighed on me since I let that kid out on Main Street, and I can only imagine that he was right about God blessing me. I came back, found a job that paid well, met the love of my life, and settled into wedded bliss fairly easy. It all seemed very easy while it was happening, and I can't help but wonder if a little divine direction had something to do with it.\n\nAs long as he doesn't point me at his enemies like he did that kid, I suppose we can be square."

        "selftext": "It was all my fault, and it almost cost Felicia and I our lives.\n\nOur friend Sandy was having a house party, and we both wanted to go. Sandy threw the best parties, and they usually got pretty wild. The last one had been a real blow out, and we both had little more than foggy memories from it. Sandy was celebrating her graduation from Nursing school, so we all knew that this one was going to be a serious rager before she had to settle in to pay student loans.\n\nBefore we went, Felicia and I had agreed that one of us needed to stay sober so we could get home safely.\n\n“We don't want a repeat of last time,” Felicia reminded me, and I nodded as I remembered how the Uber driver had tried to hold us captive until we agreed to invite him in.\n\nRunning in heels is never fun, but we had managed it that night, and beat him to the door of our apartment.\n\nSo we did rock paper scissors for it, went ten out of ten, and I ended up with the loss. I wasn't happy about it, but I decided that I would do my best to stay sober so we could get home without having to A. Get rides with creepy, handsy guys, B. Get murdered by a stranger, or C. Having to take a cab that neither of us could afford. We pulled up to the house, the party already in full swing, and I took a deep breath as I prepared to say no to temptation and be the best sober friend I could be.\n\nI lasted all of an hour at the party before I just couldn't hold out anymore. Someone handed me a drink, didn't even ask, and I drank it before I could think better of it. It was one of the very tasty screwdrivers I had seen going around, and I decided then and there that this would be the only one. I could still hold out, one drink wasn't going to get me.\n\nAn hour after that, I was completely plastered, and Felicia was not pleased. She had decided to go all in, so now both of us were drunk and had no clue how we were going to get home. We took one look at each other, laughed, and said screw it. We drank way more than we should have that night and had a blast. We danced and drank and mingled our way through the party, and when Sandy waved us out around two am, we were basically holding each other up.\n\nI staggered to the car, but I couldn't even get the key in the door to unlock it, let alone drive. Felicia and I decided we would just walk home. It was seven blocks from Sandy's house, but we had no chance of getting a cab this late and the Ubers would all be weirdos at this point. Felicia agreed, but was basically dead weight three steps later. She was ready to sleep and certainly wasn't interested in walking seven blocks. I was holding her up, looking for options as my own buzz wavered, when I saw a yellow cab parked at the corner. I got excited. It was a little late for cabs, but I wasn't about to question providence. The light was still on, the guy in the front looking pretty awake, and I thought our luck might be turning around as we staggered toward it.\n\nI knocked on the window and a guy with red hair snugged under a driving cap jumped as he turned to look at us. He was a big guy, big with fat instead of muscle, and he looked surprised but also delighted as he rolled the window down. He asked how he could help us, and I told him we needed a lift. He asked where we were going, and after telling him the address I offered to give him a nice tip if he got us there safely with no weirdness.\n\n“Yes, ma'am. I believe I can manage that,” he said with a big smile, “Hop in.”\n\nSo we piled in the back, he turned off his light, and off we went.\n\nFelicia was asleep about the time we made the first turn, but I tried to stay awake to make sure the driver didn't try any funny business. We were from a pretty big city, and girls had been going missing pretty regularly lately. You read about it on Facebook all the time, they'd go out, get a little drunk, and then they'd never see them again. No one really knew what it was, but a lot of people thought it was a murderer. It was scary to think about, but I felt a little safer being in a real cab rather than an Uber or some random guy. You never quite knew what the vetting process on Uber was, but I knew that cab companies had to do background checks on their drivers, so at least this fella was on the up and up.\n\n“You ladies coming from a club?” he asked, making small talk as he took his first left.\n\n“House party,” I said, trying to be polite, “Our friend was throwing a real heck of a get together and we partied a little too hard, I think.”\n\n“Sounds like fun.” he said with a laugh, “Looks like your friend had a little too much though.”\n\nI laughed, “Ya, she does that sometimes. I was supposed to stay sober so I could drive us home, but I'm not very good at it.”\n\nHe laughed, “Well, I guess it's a good thing for me.”\n\nI made a noncommittal noise, and settled back. There was a little holder on the patrician with waters in it, and when I reached for one, I saw the cabby turn to track my movement. He seemed interested in what I was doing, and I held up one of the waters and said that one of his fairs must have left it behind . It was a shame, because my stomach was a little too full of alcohol and some water would have been nice.\n\n“Oh, those are for fairs. I have a bunch in a cooler up here and I replace them as needed. Help yourself.”\n\nI thanked him, testing the seal to make sure it was sealed. It seemed to be, but I never got it open. The feel of the wheels beneath me was lulling me to sleep, and I was losing the fight. I tried to stay awake, but I was just too drunk. My eyes kept slipping shut and opening, slipping shut and opening, and as I threatened to go under for good, I heard his phone ring. He picked it up, talking to someone on the other end, and it was like his whole personality changed. He spoke in a much different voice than he'd used with us, and gone was a jovial guy who had picked us up. Now he was gruff and kind of short with whoever he was talking to, and it seemed like a complete flip in personality.\n\n“Ya, I gottum. We'll be there soon.”\n\nI started to ask what he meant by that, but before I could question the statement, I was unconscious.\n\nI don't know how long we were out, but I woke up suddenly and was unsure of where we were.\n\nI looked around, groggy and disoriented. Felicia was still sleeping beside me, dead to the world and not showing any signs of coming back, and the cabby was still behind the wheel and driving us home. At least, I thought he was. I glanced out the window, no longer seeing tall buildings and concrete, and thought he must have taken a wrong turn. We were in the country, the buildings traded for rural pavement and shadowy houses. Everything was dark outside, no street lights this far out in the country, and I just watched it wizz by for a moment as I tried to make sense of it. I was confused, unsure how we had gotten so lost, and then I remembered the conversation before I passed out.\n\n“Ya, I gottum. We'll see you soon.”\n\nEven in my drink-addled brain, I remembered those words.\n\nI glanced at the numbers on the dashboard clock and was surprised to see that we had been in the cab for over an hour. It shouldn't have taken that long to get home. Seven blocks would have been an easy drive this late at night, and as I tried to sit up I felt something press against my wrist. The unopened water was a cool presence against my arm. I didn't remember opening it, and realized I must have fallen asleep before I could drink it. My vision swam as I tried to come upright, and I blinked quickly to clear it.\n\n“Where,” I tried, but my throat was dry, “Where are we?”\n\nThe Cabby jumped a little, probably figuring I had passed out like my friend, and when he looked over his shoulder I heard, again, the voice of that happy cabby who had picked us up came out again.\n\n“We're driving to your home.”\n\nI tried to make his words make sense, but it was like wading through mush.\n\n“This isn't right,” I mumbled, “I live in the city.”\n\n“You told me 175 Worth Street.” he said, tapping his phone in the holder on the dash.\n\n“No,” I slurred, trying to make my head stop spinning, “It was 751 Worthy Street. We were,” I put a hand to my mouth as the hot vomit threatened to come coursing up it, “We were only seven blocks from our house.”\n\nHe put a theatrical hand to his brow, “Oh my gosh, I guess I put the address in wrong. Let me just find a place to turn around and we'll get you back on track.”\n\nHe started tapping at the phone, but I could see he wasn't hitting anything. I was suddenly wary, some of my intoxication ebbing as he put on a show of trying to get the address in right. I remembered those stories about girls going missing, and wondered if our names and faces would be on the news tomorrow. Would they think we just wandered off after drinking too much? Would they even look for us?\n\nHe turned down a side road, saying he was going to turn around, but instead of turning around he kept driving. I banged feebly at the glass that separated us, telling him he was going the wrong way, but I was so weak. I felt very dehydrated, my mouth dry and my head spinning. I reached for the water, but I thought better of it. I didn't want anything he might give me, and as the top came off, I squeezed it against the little holes that allowed us to hear him. He jumped and cursed, turning around to glower at me as the voice from the phone came back again.\n\n“You stupid bitch! I hope you keep that energy when they get you. They'll teach some manners.”\n\nMy blood ran cold at that, and I let the empty water bottle fall as I looked for other options. I tried the doors, but the child locks were on and I couldn't get it open. I started to panic. I kicked at the door, at the glass, but each kick was more feeble than the last. I was starting to feel like I might pass out again. The Cabby laughed, telling me about all the terrible things the people he was taing me to would do, and my vision was swimming with tears. I bent over and puked in the floorboard, some of my vision clearing up as I purged the liquor, but it also left me feeling weak and unsteady. I banged my head against the glass as we finally came to a halt, and I went shakily to the window to see where we were. We were not, miraculously, in front of my apartment, the whole thing a dream or a hallucination, but in a vacant lot down some country back road.\n\nAt the end of the vacant lot, perched like a gargoyle, was a white van waiting for us to arrive. As we sat idling, the doors came open and shadowy men started getting out. I felt my blood run cold as they walked toward us, stopping halfway between as if waiting for the Cabby. I thought again about my car sitting in front of Sandy's house, about how I could have just driven us home if I had stayed sober.\n\n“Looks like we've reached your destination,” said the Cabby, turning around to flash me a big creepy grin as he slid his seat belt off, “Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back,” and he hopped out to go talk to them.\n\nI shook Felicia, trying to wake her up, but she was little more than dead weight. They would get her, and they would get me in my current weakened condition. I couldn't fight them off, I could barely keep my head up, and I cried bitter tears in the back of that cab. If I was lucky, maybe they'd just kill us, but I doubted it. We were both likely to end up in some overseas brothel or on the streets of South America, and either prospect sounded grim.\n\nThe Cabby shook hands with one of the shadow people, pointing back to the cab and likely telling them he had a couple of half drunk girls ready for transport. We were in the middle of nowhere. There was no chance anyone was coming to help us. We'd be heading wherever in no time, gone and forgotten, never to be seen again, and there was nothing to be done about it.\n\nIt appeared, however, that someone had other ideas.\n\nThey had started walking toward the cab when lights suddenly lit up the back glass. Cars suddenly began pulling up, vans and undercover cars, and the people came out of them with guns drawn. The men in the headlights of the cab put their hands up and as they surrounded them they had them cuffed and collared pretty quickly. They took the men away and that was when they seemed to realize that they had people in the back of the cab. They helped us get somewhere safe so they could get us checked out and I'm pretty sure Felicia never woke up through the whole thing. They kept assuring us that we were okay, that we were safe, but all I could do was cry. I felt like I had been plucked from the brink at the last minute and I thanked them with every breath I had.\n\nThat was how I was almost trafficked by some gang or organization or another. The cops told us the less we know the better, and I agreed. I haven't drank since then, and now I'm the permanent designated driver for our group. I take friends of friends home too, sometimes intoxicated women we've met that night, just to make sure no one has to go through what I went through. "

        "selftext": "\nI don’t usually do this kind of thing, but I had fallen behind in my studies.\n\nI’ve always been an honor roll student. I had some B’s here and there, but mostly fantastic grades. I wasn’t big into extra curicular activities, but I was a library assistant and I did a little volunteer work for the required hours I needed to graduate. \n\nIt all changed when I turned seventeen. My parents had gotten me a car for my birthday. Nothing fancy, but four wheels and an engine is always nice, but it came with a caveat. If I wanted to drive it, I would need to pay for insurance on it. This led me to pick up a job, which led to a lot of closing shifts at my local fast-food chain and not a lot of time for studying or doing homework.\n\nSo when Mr. Castleberry told me that I was going to fail 12th grade English if I didn’t bring my grades up, I asked him if there wasn’t something we could work out. I had meant extra credit, maybe a make-up assignment or retake a test, but it seemed that he had other ideas. He looked around as if what he was going to tell me was likely to get him in trouble, and then he scribbled something on a piece of paper and handed it to me. When I asked him what it was, he told me to open it when I got to my car and not to tell anybody.\n\nHe refused to say anything else about it after that, and as I sat in the front seat of my car reading the message, I was a little weirded out.\n\nI mean, you saw these sorts of situations in adult films or in the back of hustler magazines, but you never really thought that it would happen in real life.\n\nMeet me at my house at seven-thirty tonight, before sunset, be prepared to stay till dawn.\n\nI started to go back in and tell him there was no way in hell, but I did need this particular class to graduate. Who knows, maybe he just liked to hang out with his students in the middle of the night. I didn’t believe that for a second, but I decided that it was worth looking into. If I wasn’t comfortable with it, I could always take the bad grade and figure something else out.\n\nIt worked out pretty good because I was off that night and Mr. Castleberry lived about fifteen minutes from my house.\n\nI pulled up outside his house at about seven-fifteen and saw him peeking out the curtains as I came up to knock. He threw the door open, looking around as if to see if I’d been followed, and then practically pulled me inside by the front of my shirt as he closed and locked the door. He threw about four different locks, as well as a chain, and then told me to follow him to the bedroom. I raised an eyebrow, that was a little fast, but I did as he asked and figured we would talk over the particulars once we got there.\n\nWhen I stepped into his bedroom, I noticed that Mr. Castleberry had an odd setup. His bed sat in the middle of a circle that I had a sneaking suspicion might be silver. The walls were painted in holy symbols and Mr. Castleberry was finishing a circle of salt around the bed as I took it all in. He pursed his lips, clearly not sure how to begin, and sat down on the bed as he tried to figure out how to explain it. \n\n“We don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll try to be quick. I have a demon inside me, a demon that only comes out at sundown.”\n\n“Bull!” I laughed, thinking he was joking, but his face was stone cold serious. \n\n“Hand of God,” he said, “That's what the circle and the salt is for. I have people I know who come and sit with me, to make sure the demon doesn’t escape somehow, but sometimes I have to ask my students to stand in. I just need you to sit there and watch me until dawn. After that, you’ll have your A.”\n\nI sighed, thinking this over. It appeared he didn’t want anything sexual, but he was certainly after something weird. Mr. Castleberry had always seemed like such a normal guy. Who would have thought he was secretly some kind of weirdo who thought he had a demon or something. \nWhatever, though. An A was an A, and I needed to pass this class.\n\n“Okay, so, what do I do if this thing gets out?”\n\nMr. Castleberry was getting comfy in bed, “There's a box beside the chair,” he said, pointing to a old wooden chair by the wall, “Use what's in there. The gun is a last resort. The bullets in it are very expensive, so I hope you’re a good shot. Don’t call the police, and don’t invite anyone over. You got that?”\n\nI nodded, reaching down beside the chair and finding the box as he got comfortable.\n\n“Good, the sun's going down, so it won't be long. Oh, the demon will try to tempt you, just make sure you don’t listen to anything it has to say. There's earplugs in the box, but I don’t recommend that you use anything electronic to block him out.”\n\n“Why not?” I asked, taking a battered old Bible and a cross out of the box. The gun inside was a heavy old revolver and it looked like it would blow a hole through a barn if I used it. There were earplugs, and a spray bottle labeled HW that I assumed would hurt the demon too.\nWhen Mr. Castleberry didn’t answer me, I asked again as I looked up. He was lying on the bed, arms crossed over his chest, as he mouthed the words to a prayer I didn’t know. He was speaking in Latin or Spanish or something, and as the sun got lower, he seemed to be fighting to finish it. His tongue was getting heavy, his words growly, and he was twitching like an epileptic.\n\nAs the sun slid below the horizon and true dark overtook the town, his eyes popped open and I heard a sound like someone popping all their vertebrae at once. He roared like a charging rhino and his body contorted on the bed like someone being flayed alive. I jumped as he writhed on the bed, knocking over the chair as I went for the door. I needed to call the hospital. This was beyond a joke, and he needed help.\n\n“N N N N NOOOO!” Mr. Castleberry forced out, “D D D Don't llllllEAVE. Stay till…DAWN. ONLY WAY TTTTTT,” but that appeared to be all I would get from Mr. Castleberry.\n\nHe went limp then, falling back to the bed as a soft and satisfied growl left him.\n\nAs he lay there, I watched as his chest rose and fell. What was going on with him? Was he actually possessed? I shook that thought off. I had been raised Catholic but the older I got, the less sure I was that God existed. If there was no God, then there was no Devil so there were no demons either. That meant that the school board was just letting someone like Mr. Castleberry teach kids with whatever mental issues he had going on. Probably schizophrenia or multiple personalities or something. I didn’t know, but if I had to stay here all night to get an A, then I supposed I would. I was gonna be tired at work tomorrow, but I had Sunday off so I could always recuperate then.\n\n“Ah, yes, the sabbath is a good day to rest. It was good enough for the All Mighty, at least, so I suppose it’s good enough for you.”\n\nI felt my breath stick in my throat. The voice I had heard from the bed had been as different from Mr. Castleberry as sandpaper was to velvet. Whoever was talking sounded like the kind of people who do the kind of ASMR that gets you banned on YouTube. It was the kind of voice that lures kids into wells, the kind of voice that lures women away from happy marriages, and the kind of voice that leaves men questioning their sexuality.\n\nI looked up to find Mr. Castleberry reclined on the bed, his head resting on his hand in what was likely supposed to be a seductive pose. His eyes were smoldering, something I hadn’t thought them capable of, and his smile was predatory. He was sizing me up like a predator preparing to spring, and I felt my skin erupt in goosebumps.\n\n“Mr. Castleberry?”\n\nIt laughed, and I felt like I should join in but forced myself not to.\n“The old man’s gone to bed, but you can talk to me if you want. My name is Satan.”\n\nI scoffed, “No way in hell. I’m sure Satan has better things to do than bother my English teacher.”\n\nHe laughed, “Very astute. The Spanish girl he brought in last time screamed and ran out of the room when I told her that. I see you have thicker skin, though. You may call me Raesh, and what may I call you?”\nI started to tell him, but I seemed to remember something about telling a demon your name and decided not to give him my real name.\n\n“Sam,” I said, earning a wide, toothy grin from the imp.\n\n“Astute and Cagey, I like that. So, how about you break that salt circle and let me out? I’m sure we could have some fun before this ole fuddy-duddy gets up.”\n\n“Wouldn’t the silver circle hold you inside too?” I asked, dubiously.\nRaesh peeked over the bed and chuckled, “That crafty old duck. Who knew you could afford that much silver on a teacher's budget. Well, no matter, if you step inside the circle, breaking it with your foot, then it isn’t a circle and I can come out. Come on, what do you say?”\n\nI found myself considering it. I had actually prepared to stand up when I realized what I was doing. I didn’t know anything about this creature, a change my mind had made from mental disease to creature, and I was just going to trust him? No, no I didn’t think so. I planted my bottom and shook my head.\n\n“I don’t think so,” I said and was surprised to find that I was almost apologetic. \n\nRaesh shrugged, “Of course not, why would you release me for free? Why wouldn’t you want to get something out of it, after all? So, what is it you want? What is this old man offering you to keep watch over me?”\n\n“Uh,” I floundered and finally just decided on the truth, “An A in his English class?”\n\nIt sounded lame, and when Raesh laughed, I knew he had thought so too.\n\n“A meaningless mark of completion? I could make you rich beyond your wildest dreams, get you any one person, any twelve people, you desire, or set you up in such a way that not graduating from school would be the least of your worries. I could do so much for you, and I don’t even need to take your soul. I just need you to free me. It’s been so long since I was free to roam the night, and I’m so very hungry.”\n\nHe had been weaving a spell around me, drawing me into his promises, but that last brought me back to my senses. What would this thing do if it got loose? Who would it hurt if it was just allowed to roam the night? I shook my head, trying to get the invasive words out of my skull, and when I turned back, Mr. Castleberry looked disappointed.\n\n“A pity. I really could have done more for you than I can for this old stick.”\n\nI ignored him after that, though he did not return the favor. I had brought some books to work on homework, but he was talking too much for me to concentrate. I spent a few hours trying to complete my Geometry Homework while he offered to help, offered to get me all the answers, offered to do things I’d rather not think about, and a hundred other such offers. He also threatened, promising a thousand different punishments for not letting him out only to walk them back a moment later and apologize.\n\nI checked my watch as I finally closed the book and discovered it was only ten thirty. I had been at this for three hours, and it didn’t seem to be going by quickly.\n\n“Only eight more hours until sunrise,” he said, guessing the source of my sighs, “Plenty of time for you to change your mind.”\n\nI reached into my pocket and pulled out the earplugs, pushing them in and taking my American History homework out.\n\nTwo hours of mostly silence later, I put it away and looked up to find Raesh looking at me a little too intently.\n\nI yawned, getting sleepy as I pulled out my phone and scrolled through TikTok. I couldn’t hear it, and as I reached for my headphones, I remembered what Mr. Castleberry had said. He had warned about using electronic headphones, but I figured one probably would be fine. Besides, they had noise reduction on them. That had to count for something.\n\nRaesh tried to call out to me when I swapped the earplug for the headphones, but I ignored him as I popped it in.\n\nI was listening to a two-minute story about something or another, but as I scrolled to the next one, I was surprised to find that it was a live stream from a familiar room. I could see myself sitting there, face glued to the phone, but as I watched, Raesh looked right at the camera and smiled. I was infuriated. Mr. Castleberry was just livestreaming himself as he scared some dumb kid of the week. In fact, the title of the stream was “High School Kid Tormented by “Demon”. He had tricked me! Why would he do that?\n\n“Why indeed?” Raesh asked, staring at me through the camera as if he could see me through the phone, “What do you owe him? He made a fool of you online. What if your friends saw this? What would they think? You’d be a social outcast. Why not give them something to watch? I bet you’d love nothing more than to wrap your hands around this fool's throat and choke the life out of him. Do it. No one would know. Just walk over here and,”\n\nI was getting up, but as I took a step towards the bed, alarm bells rang in my head. Raesh was messing with me. Looking back down at the phone, I could see it was a generic TikTok shop stream, and when I looked back up, Raesh was so close that his nose was pressed against the barrier.\n\n“Come on, just one more step. One more step and you can do whatever you want to him. Kill him, kiss him, do his laundry, I don’t care! Just LET ME OUT!” he bellowed and I stumbled back into my chair as he laughed.\nAfter that, I just watched the TikToks with the subtitles on.\n\nI didn’t trust my ears anymore.\n\nI made it till two but after that, my yawns started to sneak up on me. I wished I had brought an energy drink or something. I wasn’t used to staying up this late, not regularly, and my eyes were getting heavy. I swapped over to an adventure game on my phone, but it kept slipping longer and longer the later it got. I could see Raesh watching me, catlike as if just waiting for me to nod off. He was tricky, and I wondered if Mr. Castleberry had coffee in the kitchen. I just had to make it a little bit longer, just a few more hours and I was home free.\nI made it till three ten before I lost the fight.\n\nOne moment I was running my eight-bit knight through my hundredth dungeon, and the next I heard someone giggle from the bed. I looked up to find not the leering Raesh, but Stephanie Morgan from my math class. She was joined by Tina Feller, Debbie Rose, and half of the cheerleading squad whose names I was a little foggy on. They were in their underwear and seemed to be beckoning me to come join them. There were comments about long division and making a human pyramid, and as I got slowly to my feet, something seemed off. Where was Raesh? He had been there a minute ago. He might not have been present, but something in their voices as they called me to bed reminded me of him. It was underneath their voice, something wicked and hidden, and I shook my head and snapped my eyes open not a moment too soon.\n\nI was standing at the edge of the circle again. I had lost twenty minutes, and Raesh was cursing like a sailor as he had a tantrum in the middle of the large bed. He was thrashing hard enough to jounce the frame, but not hard enough to disturb the salt. He looked up at me with real scorn on his face, clearly contemplating all the terrible things he wanted to do to me. \n\n“You were so close! The boobie trap always gets them!”\n\nI was wide awake now, but I knew it wouldn’t last long unless I found something to focus on.\n\nThree hours, I had three hours.\n\nDespite that knowledge, I smiled at the old imp.\n\n“Can’t trick me, Raesh. No deceitful person will dwell in my house, And no liar will stand in my presence.”\n\nTo my surprise, Raesh sat back like I had slapped him. \n\nI blinked, that was different.\n\n“What? Not a big fan of scripture?”\n\nRaesh looked at me sardonically, “Obviously. I would prefer if you’d keep it to yourself in the future.”   \n\nMessage received, I thought. \n\nMaybe there was more to God than I had thought.\n\nSo that was how we spent the last three hours. I kept the old worn Bible on my lap, and whenever Raesh would start trying to worm his way back in, I would begin to read from it. It put him off talking, right up until the sky began to lighten. Then he turned to me, my eyes barely staying open, and delivered one final bit of crypticness.\n\n“I don’t have much longer. When you think back on this time, I want you to remember ttttthat you cccccoulddddd have had mmmmm more than this old st st stick ever ddddIDDD.” he growled out.\n\nAs the first rays of light came up over the window sill, he twisted violently, so violently that I thought he had broken his neck. He twitched a few more times, screaming hoarsely until he finally settled back onto the bed. I sighed as he twitched again, realizing it was over as I packed the cross and the Bible back into the box with the gun and the earplugs. The spray bottle went in last, and as I secured the lid, Mr. Castleberry sat up and stretched grandly.\n\nHe blinked and looked at me, smiling as he realized I was still there.\n“I had a feeling you wouldn’t be so easy to scare off. As promised, you’ll pass with an A now. Here,” he said, and to my surprise, he fished two one-hundred-dollar bills out of his nightstand.\n\n“What's this for?” I asked.\n\n“I give anyone who works the sundown shift two hundred bucks when they're done. There's more where that came from if you’d like to come back. The number of people who come back, however, is surprisingly low.”\n\nI asked him how he could afford this and he smiled, laughing warmly, “I don’t teach for the money. I teach because it’s what I love to do. My father set me up before I was born, something I don’t think Raesh knows. Money doesn’t mean the same thing to demons that it does to us, and I think he just sees it as a thing I have. I don’t covet it, so he doesn’t see it as a vice.”\n\nTwo hundred bucks, I thought, for twelve hours of basically nothing. I could sit with Mr. Castleberry for three nights and make what I made at the fast food place in a week. I would have to think about this very hard, but I was definitely tempted to come back. I knew what I was in for now, so it would be easier a second time. I knew Raesh would have new tricks, but maybe I’d be ready now that I was prepared.\n\nBefore I left that day, I asked him what the demon had given him to have such control after dark.\n\nMr. Castleberry thought about it for a moment and finally decided to share the secret with me.\n\n“My mother was sick, very sick, and I was looking for a miracle to make her better. Raesh’Ieal came to me and offered me a deal. He would possess my body after dark, control me from sunup to sun down, and in exchange, my mother would be spared from the disease that was killing her. I agreed, on the condition he couldn’t do anything that would take away my ability to be free during the day. He agreed, but it was all for nothing.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked,“Your mother lived, right?”\n\n“For a while. He didn’t lie, he cured her of the cancer that was eating away at her. The cancer, however, had damaged her kidneys. She lived another eight months before she died of renal failure. Let that be a lesson to you, should you decide to come back. Demons always promise the moon, but they don’t tell you that the cheese is rotten.”\n\nI left that room two hundred dollars richer and maybe a little wiser. \n\n\nWiser or not, it wasn’t the last time I sat with Mr. Castleberry and Raesh’Ieal."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n\"I heard Susan was having a party this weekend while her parents were out of town.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? Any of us get invited?\"\n\n\"Nope, just the popular kids, the jocks. and a few of the popular academic kids. No one from our bunch.\"\n\n\"Hmm sounds like a special guest might be needed then.\"\n\nWe were all sitting together in Mrs. Smith's History Class, so the nod was almost uniform.\n\nAround us, people were talking about Susan’s party. Why wouldn't they be? Susan Masterson was one of the most popular girls in school, after all, but they were also talking about the mysterious events that had surrounded the last four parties hosted by popular kids. The figure that kept infiltrating these parties was part of that mystery. Nobody knew who they were. Nobody saw them commit their heinous deeds, but the results were always the same.\n\nSometimes it was on the living room floor, sometimes it was in the kitchen on the snack table, sometimes it was in the top of the toilets in their parents' bathroom, a place that no one was supposed to have entered.\n\nNo matter where it is, someone always found poop at the party.\n\n\"Do you still have any of the candles left?\" I asked Tina, running a hand over my gelled-up hair to make sure the spikes hadn't drooped.\n\n\"Yeah, I found a place in the barrio that sells them, but they're becoming hard to track down. I could only get a dozen of them.\"\n\n\"A dozen is more than enough,\" Cooper said, \"With a dozen, we can hit six more parties at least.\"\n\n\"Pretty soon,\" Mark said, \"They'll learn not to snub us. Pretty soon, they'll learn that we hold the fate of their precious parties.\"\n\nThe bell rang then, and we rose like a flock of ravens and made our way out of class.\n\nThe beautiful people scoffed at us as we walked the halls, saying things like \"There goes the coven\" and \"Hot Topic must be having a going-out-of-business sale\" but they would learn better soon.\n\nBefore long, they would know we were the Lord of this school cause we controlled that which made them shiver.  \n\nI’ve never been what you’d call popular. I've probably been more like what you'd call a nerd since about the second grade. Don’t get me wrong, I was a nerd before that, but that was about the time that my peers started noticing it. They commented on my thick glasses, my love of comic books, and the fact that I got our class our pizza party every year off of just the books that I read. Suddenly it wasn’t so cool to be seen with the nerd. I found my circle of friends shrinking from grade to grade, and it wasn’t until I got to high school that I found a regular group of people that I could hang with.\n\nIncidentally, that was also the year I discovered that I liked dressing Goth. \n\nMy colorful wardrobe became a lot darker, and I started ninth grade with a new outlook on life. \n\nMy black boots, band t-shirt, and ripped black jeans had made me stand out, but not in the way I had hoped. I went from being a nerd to a freak, but I discovered that the transformation wasn't all bad. Suddenly, I had people interested in getting to know me, and that was how I met Mark, Tina, and Cooper.\n\nI was a sophomore now, and despite some things having changed, some things had stayed the same.\n\nWe all acted like we didn't care that the popular kids snubbed us and didn't invite the nerds or the freaks to their parties, but it still didn't feel very good to be ostracized. We were never invited to sit with them at lunch, never asked to go to football games or events, never invited to spirit week or homecoming, and the more we thought about it, the more that felt wrong.\n\nThat was when Tina came to us with something special.\n\nTina was a witch. Not the usual fake wands and butterbeer kind of witch, but the kind with real magic. She had inherited her aunt's grimoire, a real book of shadows that she'd used when she was young, and Tina had been doing some hexes and curses on people she didn't like. She had given Macy Graves that really bad rash right before homecoming, no matter how much she wanted to say it was because she was allergic to the carnation Gavin had got her. She had caused Travis Brown to trip in the hole and lose the big game that would have taken us to state too. People would claim they were coincidences, but we all knew better.\n\nSo when she came to us and told us she had found something that would really put a damper on their parties, we had been stoked.\n\n\"Susan's party is tomorrow,\" Tina said, checking her grimoire as we walked to art class, \"So if we do the ritual tomorrow night, we can totally ruin her party.\"\n\nSome of the popular girls, Susan among them, looked up as we passed, but we were talking too low for them to hear us. Susan mouthed the word Freaks, but I ignored her. She'd see freaks tomorrow night when her little party got pooped on.\n\nWe spent art class discussing our own gathering for tomorrow. After we discovered the being in Tina's book, we never called what we did parties anymore. They were gatherings now, it sounded more occult. We weren't some dumb airheads getting together for beer and hookups. We were a coven coming together to make some magic. That was bigger than anything these guys could think of.\n\n\"Cooper, you bring the offering and the snacks,\" Tina said.\n\nCooper made a face, \"Can I bring the drinks instead? Brining food along with the \"offering\" just seems kinda gross.\\`\\`\n\nTina thought about it before nodding, \"Yeah, good idea, and be sure you wash your hands after you get the offering.\" \n\nCooper nodded, \"Good, 'cause I still have Bacardi from last time.\"\n\n\"Mark, you bring snacks then.\" Tina said, \"And don't forget to bring the felenol weed. We need it for the ritual.\"\n\nMark nodded, \"Mr. Daccar said I could have the leftover chicken at the end of shift, so I hope that's okay.\"\n\nThat was fine with all of us, the chicken Mark brought was always a great end to a ritual.\n\n\"Cool, that leaves the ipecac syrup and ex-lax to you, my dear,\" she said, smiling at me as my face turned a little red under my light foundation.\n\nTina and I had only been an item for a couple of weeks, and I still wasn't quite used to it. I'd never had a girlfriend before then, and the giddy feeling inside me was at odds with my goth exterior. Tina was cute and she was the de facto leader of our little coven. It was kind of cool to be dating a real witch. \n\n\"So, we all meet at my house tomorrow before ten, agreed?\"\n\nWe all agreed and the pact was sealed.\n\nThe next night, Friday, I arrived at six, so Tina and I could hang out before the others got there. Her parents were out of town again, which was cool because she never had to make excuses for why she was going out. My parents thought I was spending the night at Marks, Cooper's parents thought he was spending the night at Marks, and Mark's Mom was working a third shift so she wasn't going to be home to answer either if they called to check up. It was a perfect storm, and we were prepared to be at the center of it.\n\nTina was already setting up the circle and making the preparations, but she broke off when I came in with my part of the ritual.\n\nWe were both a little out of breath when Cooper arrived an hour later, and after hurriedly getting ourselves back in order, he came in with two twelve packs.\n\n\"Swiped them from my Uncle. He's already drunk, so he'll never miss them. I think he just buys them for the twenty-year-olds he's trying to bang anyway.\"\n\n\"As long as you brought the other thing too,\" Tina said, \"Unless you mean to make it here.\"\n\nCooper rolled his eyes and held up a grungy Tupperware with a severe-looking lid on it.\n\n\"I got it right here, don't you worry.\"\n\nHe helped us with the final prep work, and we were on our thousandth game of Mario Kart by the time Mark got there at nine. He smelled like grease and chicken and immediately went to change out of his work clothes. I didn't know about everyone else, but I secretly loved that smell. Mark was self-conscious about smelling like fried chicken, but I liked it. If I thought it was a smell I wouldn't become blind to after a few weeks, I'd probably ask him to get me a job at Colonel Registers Chicken Chatue too. \n\nCooper tried to reach in for some chicken, but Tina smacked his hand.\n\n\"Ritual first, then food.\"\n\nCooper gave her a dark look but nodded as we headed upstairs.\n\nIt was time to ruin another Amberzombie and Fitch party.\n\nWhen Tina had showed us the summons for something called the Party Pooper, we had all been a little confused.\n\n\"The Party Pooper?\" Cooper had asked, pointing to the picture of the little man with the long beard and the evil glint in his eye.\n\n\"The Party Pooper.” Tina confirmed, “He's a spirit of revenge for the downtrodden. He comes to those who have been overlooked or mistreated and brings revenge in their name by,\" she looked at what was written there, \"leaving signs of the summoners displeasure where it can be found.\"\n\n\"Neat,\" said Cooper, \"how do we summon him?\"\n\nTurns out, the spell was pretty easy. We would need a clay vessel, potions, or tinctures to bring about illness from the well, herbs to cover the smell of waste, and the medium by which revenge will be achieved. Once the ingredients were assembled, they would light the candles, and perform the chant to summon the Party Pooper to do our bidding. That first time, it had been a kegger at David Frick's house, and we had been particularly salty about it. David had invited Mark, the two of them having Science together, and when Mark had seemed thrilled to be invited, David had laughed.\n\n\"Yeah right, Chicken Fry. Like I need you smelling up my party.\"\n\nEveryone had laughed, and it had been decided that David would be our first victim.\n\nAs we stood around the earthen bowl, Tina wrinkled her nose as she bent down to light the candles.\n\n\"God, Cooper. Do you eat anything besides Taco Bell?\"\n\nCooper shrugged, grinning ear to ear, \"What can I say? It was some of my best work.\"\n\nThe candles came lit with a dark and greasy light. The ingredients were mixed in the bowl, and then the offering had been laid atop it. The spell hadn't been specific in the kind of filth it required but, given the name of the entity, Tina had thought it best to make sure it was fresh and ripe. That didn't exactly mean she wanted to smell Cooper's poop, but it seemed worth the discomfort. \n\n\"Link hands,\" she said, \"and begin the chant.\"\n\nWe locked hands, Mark's as clammy as Tina's were sweaty, and began the chant.\n\n*Every party needs a pooper.*\n\n*That's why we have summoned you.*\n\n*Party Pooper!*\n\n*Party Pooper!* \n\nThe circle puffed suddenly, the smell like something from an outhouse. The greasy light of the candles showed us the now familiar little man, his beard long and his body short. He was bald, his head liver-spotted, and his mean little eyes were the color of old dog turds. His bare feet were black, like a corpse, and his toes looked rotten and disgusting. He wore no shirt, only long brown trousers that left his ankles bare, and he took us in with weary good cheer.\n\n\"Ah, if it isn't my favorite little witches. Who has wronged you tonight, children?\"\n\nWe were all quiet, knowing it had to be Tina who spoke.\n\nThe spell had been pretty clear that a crime had to be stated for this to work. The person being harassed by the Party Pooper had to have wronged one of the summoners in some way for revenge to be exacted, so we had to find reasons for our ire. The reason for David had come from Mark, and it had been humiliation. After David had come Frank Gold and that one had come from Cooper. Frank had cheated him, refusing to pay for an essay he had written and then having him beaten up when he told him he would tell Mr. Bess about it. Cooper had sighted damage to his person and debt. The third time had been mine, and it was Margarette Wheeler. Margarette and I had known each other since elementary school, and she was not very popular. She and I had been friends, but when I had asked her to the Sadie Hawkins Dance in eighth grade, she had laughed at me and told me there was no way she would be seen with a dork like me. That had helped get her in with the other girls in our grade and had only served to alienate me further. I had told the Party Pooper that her crime was disloyalty, and it had accepted it.\n\nNow it was Susan's turn, and we all knew that Tina had the biggest grudge against her for something that had happened in Elementary school.\n\n\"Susan Masterson,\" Tina intoned.\n\n\"And how has this Susan Masterson wronged thee?\"\n\n\"She was a false friend who invited me to her house so she could humiliate me.\"\n\nThe Party Pooper thought about this but didn't seem to like the taste.\n\n\"I think not.\" he finally said.\n\nThere was a palpable silence in the room.\n\n“No, she,”\n\n“Has it never occurred to you that this Susan Masterson may have done you a favor? Were it not for her, you may very well have been somewhere else tonight, instead of surrounded by loyal friends.”\n\nTina was silent for a moment, this clearly not going as planned. \n\n\"No, I think it is jealousy that drives your summons tonight. You are jealous of this girl, and you wish to ruin her party because of this.\"\n\nHe floated a little higher over the circle we had created, and I didn't like the way he glowered down at us.\n\n\"What is more, you have ceased to be the downtrodden, the mistreated, and I am to blame for this. I have empowered you and made you dependent, and I am sorry for this. Do not summon me again, children. Not until you have a true reason for doing such.\"\n\nWith that, he disappeared in a puff of foul wind and we were left standing in stunned silence.\n\nIt hadn't worked, the Party Pooper had refused to help us.\n\n\"Oh well,\" Cooper said, sounding a little downtrodden, \"I guess we didn't have as good a claim as we thought. Well, let's go eat that chicken,\" he said, turning to go.\n\n\"That sucks,\" Mark said, \"Next time we'll need something a little fresher, I suppose.\" \n\nThey were walking out of the room, but as I made to follow them, I noticed that Tina hadn’t moved. She was staring at the spot where the Party Pooper had been, tears welling in her eyes, and as I put a hand on her shoulder, she exhaled a loud, agitated breath. I tried to lead her out of the room, but she wouldn't budge, and I started to get worried.\n\n\"T, it's okay. We'll try again some other time. Those assholes are bound to mess up eventually and then we can get them again. It's just a matter of time.\"\n\nTina was crying for real now, her mascara running as the tears fell in heavy black drops.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" she said, \"It's not fair! She let me fall asleep and then put my hand in water. She took it away after I wet myself, but I saw the water ring. I felt how wet my fingers were, and when she laughed and told the other girls I wet myself, I knew she had done it on purpose. She ruined it, she ruined my chance of being popular! It's not fair. How is my grievance any less viable than you guys?\"\n\n\"Come on, hun,\" I said, \"Let's go get drunk and eat some chicken. You'll feel a lot better.\"\n\nI tried to lead her towards the door, but as we came even with it she shoved me into the hall and slammed it in my face.\n\nMark and Cooper turned as they heard the door slam, and we all came back and banged on it as we tried to get her to answer.\n\n\"Tina? Tina? What are you doing? Don't do anything stupid!\"\n\nFrom under the door, I could see the light of candles being lit, and just under the sound of Mark and Cooper banging, I could hear a familiar chant.\n\n*Every party needs a pooper.*\n\n*That's why I have summoned you.*\n\n*Party Pooper!*\n\n*Party Pooper!* \n\nThen the candlelight was eclipsed as a brighter light lit the room. We all stepped away from the door as an otherworldly voice thundered through the house. The Party Pooper had always been a jovial little creature when we had summoned him, but this time he sounded anything but friendly. \n\nThe Party Pooper sounded pissed.\n\n\"YOU DARE TO SUMMON ME, MORTAL? YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE OWED MY POWER? YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE ENTITLED TO MY AID? SEE NOW WHY THEY CALL ME THE PARTY POOPER!\"\n\nThere was a sound, a sound somewhere between a jello mold hitting the ground and a truckload of dirt being unloaded, and something began to ooze beneath the door.\n\nWhen it popped open, creaking wide with horror movie slowness, I saw that every surface in Tina's room was covered in a brown sludge. It covered the ceiling, the walls, the bed, and everything in between. Tina lay in the middle of the room, her body covered in the stuff, and as I approached her, the smell hit me all at once. It was like an open sewer drain, the scent of raw sewage like a physical blow, and I barely managed to power through it to get to Tina's side. \n\n\"Tina? Tina? Are you okay?\"\n\nShe said nothing, but when she opened her mouth, a bucket of that foul-smelling sewage came pouring out. She coughed, and more came up. She spent nearly ten minutes vomiting up the stuff, and when she finally stopped, I got her to her feet and helped her out of the room.\n\n\"Start the shower. We need to get this stuff off her.\"\n\nI put her in the shower, taking her sodden clothes off and cleaning the worst of it off her. She was covered in it. It was caked in her ears, in her nose, in...other places, and it seemed the Party Pooper had wasted nothing in his pursuit of justice. She still wouldn't speak after that, and I wanted to call an ambulance.\n\n\"She could be really sick,\" I told them when Cooper said we shouldn't, \"That stuff was inside her.\"\n\n\"If we call the hospital, our parents are going to know we lied.\"\n\nIn the end, it was a chance I was willing to take.\n\nI stayed, Mark and Cooper leaving so they didn't get in trouble. I told the paramedics that she called me, saying she felt like she was dying and I came to check on her. They loaded her up and called her parents, but I was told it would be better if I went back home and waited for updates.\n\nTina was never the same after that.\n\nHer mother thanked me for helping her when I came to see her, but told me Tina wouldn't even know I was there.\n\n\"She's catatonic. They don't know why, but she's completely lost control of her bowels. She vomits for no reason, she has...I don't know what in her stomach but they say it's like she fell into a septic tank. She's breathed it into her lungs, it's behind her eyelids, she has infections in her ears and nose because of it, and we don't know whats wrong with her.”\n\nThat was six months ago. They had Tina put into an institution so someone could take care of her 24\/7, but she still hasn't said a word. She's getting better physically, but something is broken inside her. I still visit her, hoping to see some change, but it's like talking to a corpse. I still hang out with Cooper and Mark, but I know they feel guilty for not going to see her.\n\nIn the end, Tina tried to force her revenge with a creature she didn't understand and paid the price.\n\nSo, if you ever think you might have a grievance worthy of the Party Pooper, do yourself a favor, and just let it go.\n\nNothing is worth incurring the wrath of that thing, and you might find yourself in deep shit for your trouble."

No one would be able to hear us over the racket the kids were making, less chance of people eavesdropping. The closer I got to him, the more I had to remind myself why I was doing this. I think I would have rather kept suffering the Miasma in my house than meet with Agent Cash again, but what choice did I have?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe needed to know where the Miasma had taken Celene, and he knew how to find that kind of information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I must say,\" he said, his fingers locked before him on the chipped Formica table, \"I was surprised to hear from you so soon.

This kind of thing really doesn't make me want to stay quiet about what you have going on behind closed bathroom doors.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash rolled his eyes, \"Because you've been SO quiet about it. Do you think we haven't read your little story? If anyone took your little story online seriously, we'd have already made you disappear, and your little dog too.\"\n\nI wanted to laugh at his reference, but I wasn't in the mood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A. I started that before I had even met you and B. That is not the point. You still haven't explained why your creatures took my friend.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest,\" he said, \"If the miasma took someone, it wasn't on my order.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had expected him to lay out some kind of grand plan or make threats and ultimatums, but the knowledge that he wasn't involved in this was scarier by far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But,\" I tried to put together something cohesive and mostly failed, \"Aren't you, like, the leader here? Your shadowy organization is at the head of this kind of thing.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe shrugged, \"I don't know what to tell you, kid. We run operations on this side, but I'm not the King of the Dollar General Beyond. The miasma do what they want sometimes, but this is disturbing.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe reached for his drink and it took everything I had not to slap it out of his hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Because, until you just told me, we were unaware that they could interact with things outside the stores. They've never done it before, at least as far as we know, and it shouldn't be possible.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe glanced around, the kids in the play place really exercising their lungs as they ran amok, before leaning in closer than I strictly wanted him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Look, the stores aren't entirely natural. The organization, the one that tracks the Dollar Generals, isn't the one that builds them. Hell, we don't even know about them sometimes until some shlub calls to see if we're hiring for a new location. Then we put a pin in a map and open a new store.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat back a little, trying to wrap my head around this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Then...how do they get built?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe smiled, \"You ever notice that sometimes there are multiple Dollar Generals within blocks of each other? You drive into town and think \"Oh look, a new Dollar General. But they sure put that up quick.\" Well, WE didn't. They just appear. No one builds them, no one contracts them, and a big chunk of our revenue each year goes to fines for not securing permits for these stores. We pay off individuals sometimes, sometimes we show doctored paperwork saying we had contracts and permits, but it's all bullshit. I'll tell you something else, too,\" he said, taking a long sip of whatever was in the cup before continuing, \"For every store that pops up, another store appears in the Beyond too. I don't know if it's a matter of which came first, the Beyond or the Store, but when we investigate the new store's connection, there's always a counterpart in the Beyond.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a lot to process, and I was glad I hadn't bought food before sitting down with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What's to stop them from just popping up everywhere?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe smiled at me, and the effect was chilling, \"Not a damn thing. Perhaps one day the Dollar Generals will conquer the earth, just a world of stores as far as the eye can see. It would be terrifying if it wasn't so intriguing.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was getting sidetracked and I knew it, \"So how do we get my friend back?\"\n\nHe looked at me over the top of his lid, the cup making a slurping sound as he emptied it, \"You don't,\" he said as if it should be obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI exhaled, \"That's not an option. We have to get her back.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash scoffed, the ice rattling as he put the cup down, \"You are one of the only escapees from the Dollar General Beyond. Are you in that much of a hurry to go back?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"If that's what I have to do,\" I answered without hesitation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash just rolled his eyes, \"It's not like there's a surefire way to get there.\"\n\nHe said it, but I wasn't entirely sure I believed him. I can't prove it, but I had a theory that beneath that unconvincing skinsuit was something similar to what had grabbed Celene. He may not be king of the miasma, but he was one of them, and he had to have a way to take shore leave sometimes. I hadn't really expected him to just hand us the keys and let us head to the other side, but I had hoped he would let more slip than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Well, I need my friend back, and you're the only person I know who knows about the Beyond, besides Gale and I.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash shrugged, \"That sounds like a you problem. I only agreed to meet with you because my supervisors were afraid you were getting ready to do something stupid. If you go and get yourself back into the Beyond, don't expect another check if you make it back out again. We don't pay people to go sightseeing. Well, we do, but the training to head into the Beyond and come back out makes astronauts look like Boy Scouts.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe got up, as if meaning to go, but snapped his fingers again and sat back down, startling me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Speaking of, I have been authorized to make you an offer on your travel journal by the higher-ups.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wasn't sure what he meant at first, but then I realized he was talking about the journal I had made of the various Dollar General Beyond stores. Why would they want it, I wondered? They controlled the stores, they should know them like the back of their hand. This made me think again that this side of the operation might not be as in control as I had thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Not a chance,\" I said, \"I had to make that at great personal risk to myself. It's priceless.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Incorrect,\" Cash said, reaching into his breast pocket, \"It's worth this much.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe slid a piece of paper across the table with enough 0s on it to make my eyebrows go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Wow, well, that is a generous offer, but I still have to decline.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" he said, \"When you need cash, let us know. It's unlikely we'll get a better one, but if we do the offer is, obviously, null and void.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe left then, and I went and got food. Dark revelations or not, I was still hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGale was leaning against the wall across from the closet when I got him, just staring at it in abject dejection. Buddy had his head in his lap, and Gale was petting him absentmindedly. Gale told me later that he had intentions of...uh unaliving himself while I was gone but the pupper had changed his mind. Buddy was great at so many things it seemed, and really was a good boy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Did that grinning imp have anything to say?\" he asked, never looking up from Buddy's coat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Just that he wasn't going to let us in, and he wasn't going to go get her for us.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Pretty much what I expected,\" Gale said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat down across from him then, really looking at him as he sat there stroking the dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"So what are we going to do?\" I asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Somehow,\" Gale said, and for a moment he sounded like his old self again, \"We have to get back into the Beyond.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe spent the afternoon sharing knowledge. I told him what Cash had told me, and he told me what he made of it. We made plans, put aside plans, and made new plans. Ultimately, we didn't do much but keep each other company, but that seemed to be enough for that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have a lot else to say, but I'll keep you updated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil then, be safe out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou never know when the Beyond might decide to reach out and grab you."

He had gone into the equipment shed looking for answers, and what he had found scared him nearly to death. As he banged on the door, he could hear the creature pulling itself free of the wall behind him. The massive paws came to rest on the ground, the claws clittered on the pavement, and he could almost feel the rumble as the beast came for him.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put a hand over my mouth to stifle a gasp, but Terrence didn't seem to have any such hesitation. He moaned like a trained mourner in a soap opera, and Ralphie slapped a hand over his gaping mouth as he leaned forward in expectation. Danny had all of us in the grip of his story, and he knew it. He continued to weave his tale as I tempered my excitement with the reminder to listen for the approach of Coach Tyson.\n\n\"The handle, which had been unlocked when Markie had come in, was as unyielding as the walls around him, and as the beast came closer and closer, Markie felt terror growing inside him, threatening to overtake him.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI perked up my ears, having heard a noise on this side of the veil. Was it Coach Tyson looking for four missing students? Was it Coach Lianna coming to get something from the equipment shed? Was it a monster like the one in Danny's story that was stalking us from amidst the dusty football pads? Who could say?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The monster leaned down over him, its breath hot against his ear as it spoke. \"I told you what would happen if I caught you in my lair again. Now, I am prepared to make good on that promise.\" Something wet fell on his shoulder, the spittle dribbling down as it prepared to rip his head off.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were all leaning in, our heads close enough to be clonked together like the three stooges, just waiting for the thrust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"When the door opened suddenly, Markie fell into the hallway. Coach Blaskawhit looked shocked, and Markie crawled behind his legs as he looked into the equipment room, the creature nowhere to be seen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs if on cue, the door came open and Coach Tyson poked his head in with a dramatic \"ah ha.\" He acted like he had caught four weasels in his hen house, but he couldn't have been that surprised to find us here. We met here in the equipment shed every chance we got, and we were constantly ditching gym class to tell spooky stories.\n\n\"I thought I'd find you four here. If you intend to finish your mile in the allotted time, you better hurry. There's twenty minutes left in class, and I think it's going to take every bit you've got to finish in that time.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI squinted owlishly as I came out, the sun very bright after being in the depths of the equipment shed, and rolled my eyes as I saw Justin and his friends, Ryan and Frank, sitting on the grass by the finish line. Coach Tyson probably hadn't even noticed we were missing until those three had finished their laps, and now we had less than twenty minutes to run a mile. Coach shouted for us to get a move on, so we got a move on and started beating feet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we ran, I asked Danny if he had meant for the Coach to burst in in his story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Absolutely. You didn't really think I would let the monster get Markie, did ya?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had, but I didn't say as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sucks he found us. I had a great story planned for today too.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny laughed, and it made me feel a little angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Nothing personal, but your stories kinda blow.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI slowed a little, not quite wanting to understand him, before speeding up to catch up with the group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What do you mean? My stories are as good as yours.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey weren't, and I knew they weren't, but my pride was hurt, and I wanted to vent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny looked like he was going to answer, but Terrence beat him to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"No way, dude. Danny's stories are the best. Your stories sound like something that wouldn't make it on a kids horror site.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't what Terrence said that got me, he was too stupid to chew gum and walk, but it was the little nod that Danny gave in return that really rankled me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was still thinking about it as Ralphie and I rode the bus on the way home, Ralphie trying to cheer me up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Come on, buck up. Danny isn't such hot crap.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Stupid Danny,\" I groused, doodling on my pad as I sulked, \"Thinks he's such hot crap just because he's in Mrs. Hurckamer's Creative Writing class, just because Mrs. Hurckamer invites him to the eight-grade writing club after school. I can write just as good as he can.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRaphie was watching me doodle over my shoulder, raising an eyebrow as the picture took shape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Who's this fella you're drawing here?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked down, not paying attention to what I was doodling, and almost started. I had drawn a large, muscled man, his face bulbous and ugly. One eye bulged from his skull while the other seemed too deep in the socket. His cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk looking for nuts for winter. He had a hump, one shoulder higher than the other, and his arms ended not in hands, but in rounded tumors that had scabrous bulges on them that looked to be trickling puss or something. He had no fingers, no knuckles, just those big round bulges at the ends of his arms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Billy,\" I said, absentminded again though it was from the shock of this creature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Billy?\" asked Ralphie, the bus jouncing him as it took off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Billy...Gumballs,\" I said, drawing a pair of overalls onto him. I added large, gum rubber boots without socks and a few more veins on his rounded not hands. I drew an undershirt but erased it. It didn't seem right, and it looked better without it, \"He was bullied in high school for being different, and they called him Billy Gumballs because his cheeks bulged like he was chewing too much gum. When he was snubbed by his crush for the school dance, he murdered the kids at the dance and disappeared before the police arrived. The school was abandoned after that, and now the local kids think the place is haunted. They're right, because Billy still lives there he kills anyone who comes into his school.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRalphie listened, nodding along as the story came together. As the bus rumbled away from the school and towards our street, I told him how four middle school kids had gone into the old school on a dare, and how each of them had run afoul of Billy Gumballs. Only the last kid had survived, and Billy had let him go so he could tell his story and people would be afraid of him. The kids died in the usual horror movie ways, but mostly they were crushed by the heavy tumor hands of Billy Gumballs. I illustrated some as I talked, and as the bus stopped at Ralphie's house, he smacked my arm and told me I had written a real great story there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What story?\" I asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I had been doing was doodling and talking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Your Billy Gumballs story. You should tell it tomorrow, I bet Danny wouldn't say it blowed.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized he was right, and what's more, I realized I could do one better than just telling it. As I got home, I lay on the couch and started drawing it out. I could make a horror comic out of it, something that even Danny couldn't do, and then I could impress him. That would show Danny whose stories blow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI drew the last couple of panels as I lay in bed that night, and when I tucked it into my backpack, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn't wait for school the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI worked on the cover for it as I rode the bus to school the next morning, and when I stepped off, I was so excited to show it to Danny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was excited, right up until I ran into Justin, Ryan, and Frank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Whatcha got there, Nerd?\" Justin said, seeing the hand-drawn comic under my arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Nothin',\" I said hastily, trying to get past the trio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJustin and his friends, aside from being good at gym, were pretty big bullies in my grade, and when Ryan deftly took the comic from under my arm, I cawed and told him to give it back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Billy Gumballs?\" he said, tossing it to Justin as they played keep away, \"What the hell is this?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's a school project,\" I lied, trying to get it back from them, \"Come on, give it back before you wreck it!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJustin opened it up, thumbing through the pages as he deftly avoided me, \"Huh, not too bad, for a baby,\" he said, tearing one of the pages in half and letting it fall to the ground.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can probably guess what happened after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time the bell rang, I was left on my knees in the hallway, trying not to cry as I salvaged the pages of my comic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was ruined, wrecked beyond repair, and as I sat in homeroom and seethed, I knew just what I would do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd make another one, but instead of four friends going to find Billy, it would be four bullies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure why, there was no reason to do it, but as I remade the comic, Danny became the leader of the bullies. He hadn't done anything worse than offering honest criticism, but I couldn't help but think of him as responsible for this too. Without Danny, I would have never drawn the comic. Without Danny, it would never have existed to be destroyed in the first place. No one survived this time. They were all killed by Billy Gumballs, and as I finished the last page, I felt a weird surge course over the hairs on my arms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of something my Grandma had said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of having a goose walk over my grave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the bell rang, I found my friends by the stairwell, waiting for me before we went into English. Ralphie nudged Danny, who was standing off and looking guilty, and when he walked up he rubbed the back of his neck as he apologized. I was sure that Ralphie had put him up to it, but the longer it went on, the more genuine it seemed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't know what I said affected you like that. I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Ralphie says you've been working on something cool. I'd love to see it if you want me to.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to say something, but I was dumbstruck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, the comic in my hand felt like an accusation and the last thing I wanted to do was hand it to Danny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's not quite done yet,\" I said, pushing it behind my back, \"I don't wanna show it to you until it's perfect.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny nodded, clearly wanting to see but still feeling guilty for what he had done yesterday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"That's cool, I'd still be glad to look at it when you get it done. Ralphie has been talking about this Billy Gumballs all through homeroom. He sounds pretty cool.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI filled Danny in on some of the details, slipping the comic into my bag as we walked to class. I would redraw it later, I decided. I was a so-so storyteller, but I was good at drawing and I knew I could make another one before the end of the day. I'd just draw Justin and his friends getting smashed up by Billy. That would be fine. Danny had apologized, but I was still mad that those bullies had wrecked up my original comic. I doodled in English and then did some more in Math class. By social studies, I was getting close to completing it, and as the lunch bell rang, I put the finishing touches on it, yet again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was weird, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got done, I didn't get that same feeling I had gotten from the one I’d made earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis time it just felt normal, like it always did when I completed a drawing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shook it off, figuring it was just nerves, and took it to the cafeteria to show my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe spent the lunch period marveling at the intricate ways that Billy Gumballs smashed and bashed the three boys who had made our lives a living hell since kindergarten. Danny laughed more than he looked afraid, but when he tapped the comic with the back of his hand and declared it to be the best story I had ever written, I felt pretty proud of myself. The guilt I had for the one that was hidden in my backpack was gone, and I felt like maybe we could begin to get past this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen a scream erupted from the hallway outside the cafeteria, we all ran to see what had happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was Vanessa Franks, and she was pointing to the crumpled form of Justin's friend, Fred. He was leaning against one of the lockers, his head little more than a pulpy melon. We would learn later that his skull had been caved in, the bone shattered like an egg. Vanessa had been on her phone, not really paying attention to where she was going, and slipped in the pool of blood that was forming from beneath him. That was why she had screamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had slipped and looked up into the ruined face of her classmate and nearly lost her mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey came and took the body away, but all of us were in the gymnasium by that point. They had moved all the students there and locked the school down while they searched for the killer. They felt pretty confident that they had to be somewhere in the building, and they would have to have a lot of blood on them after what they had done. Beating Fred to death would have left quite a lot of damage to them as well, and the teachers and police had interviewed most of the students to see if they could narrow down a suspect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friends might be chattering about the murder, but I was on pins and needles. They had forgotten about my comic, and thank God for that. The one they had seen, however, wasn't the one I was worried about. It was the comic in my bag that made me afraid. If the cops found that comic, I would have a lot of questions to answer, and they would probably be answered in a little room at the police station.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a picture in that comic of Fred with his head smashed against a locker, and it looked very similar to the scene upstairs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFred had been the first victim, and when Justine turned to Danny and asked what they were going to do now, Danny had told them they would find who had done this and put him down like a dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's weird, isn't it?\" Ralphie said, bringing me out of my contemplation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What's weird?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You drew a comic about those bullies getting killed, and then one of them gets his head caved in.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agreed that it was pretty weird, reflecting that I was glad the one I had shown them had featured Fred getting thrown down some stairs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You,\" Ralphie started, wetting his lips as if not sure how to begin, \"You didn't have anything to do with that, did you?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to deny it right away, but I was having trouble forming a good argument. Of course I didn't have anything to do with it. How could he even think such a thing? Just because I had drawn something similar, didn't mean I had anything to do with this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"How could I, Ralphie? I was in the cafeteria with you guys when it happened, remember?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRalphie nodded, but the look he gave me was still pretty hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey put us all on buses and sent us home not long later. We were assured that school would be back in session tomorrow, but we weren't so sure. They still hadn't found the killer, not a trace of him, and Fred's parents were distraught. The bus Ralphie and I had been on had driven past his mother as we pulled off and she was shaking with tears as she sat on a bench outside the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeeing that made me feel guilty all over again, but I wasn't sure why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRalphie didn't talk much on the ride home, and the goodbye he gave me when he climbed off was decidedly muted. I wondered if he really thought I had done this, and as my stop came up, I decided I wanted a nap instead of TV. I tossed my backpack down when I got home and went to lie down on the couch, but my nap wouldn't last long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the phone rang a little bit later, I got up and answered it groggily. It was Thursday, so Mom wouldn't get off till five, and Dad wouldn't be in till after bedtime. I had the house to myself till five thirty, but I wished they had been here. I needed to talk to someone about this, about the guilt I was feeling for some reason, and I just knew my parents would help me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found Terrence on the other end of the phone, and he sounded hysterical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They found Ryan's body this afternoon at the school!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat up straighter, not sure if I was awake or still dreaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, \"He was on a bus home, same as the rest of us.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I know,\" Terrence said, \"but my Dad called me about ten minutes ago all spazy. He said that one of the officers had been searching for the guy under the bleachers in the gym when he had found Ryan all crumpled up under there. He was beaten to a pulp, and he wanted to know if I had locked the doors and was being safe. I told him I was, and he told me to go upstairs and lock myself in my room until my mom got home. I'm scared, I don't know what's going on, but it sounds like kids at our school are getting killed.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, I thought, as the phone slipped out of my hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot just any kids from our school, kids that I had drawn in a comic dying in the ways they had been found dead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the comic, the one I had hid from my friends, Ryan had been dragged under the bleachers and the group had found him later beaten to a pulp. A literal pulp. In the comic, they only knew it was him by his sneakers since the rest of his body was a bloody pile of meat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Terrence, does your dad think they have any idea who's doing this?\" I hedged, trying to find out if I was a suspect for some reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Not a clue, but the police are really scratching their heads.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hung up on Terrence and hovered over the number for Danny's house. I was hesitant to call him, wanting to worry him even less than I wanted to admit to having written this suddenly relevant comic. I dithered for a few before thumbing his name, listening to it ring before his mother grabbed it on the fourth one. She told me that Danny was at the pizzeria on Sherman and she supposed he had forgotten his phone. She asked if I wanted to leave a message, but I told her that was fine and I was going to meet him at the pizzeria anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe hung up and I grabbed my backpack as I headed out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy timing must have been impeccable because I caught him just as his pie arrived at the table.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Hey, you feel like a slice too?\" he asked, inviting me to sit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Na,\" I said, taking the comic out of the bag, \"I need to come clean with you. I could overlook the first one as an accident, but after they found Ryan dead too, I don't think I can overlook it. This was the comic I did earlier today, something I wrote while I was mad at Justin and his friends.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny looked at the cover, opening it up and leafing through it. He raised an eyebrow when he saw himself leading the bullies. As he read, though, something strange happened. Far from being horrified, he began to laugh. When he came to Justin's death, the bully decapitated with a single punch, his head falling down the stairs and into the boiler room, Danny wiped an eye and looked at me in disbelief.\n\nHe seemed confused that I wasn't laughing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Oh, come on. Sure, it's scary, but it's also so over the top that it's almost cartoonish.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Two people have died in exactly the way I drew this. I am only one, besides you, who knows it exists, and I can't help but think it's a little bit serious. They'll put me in jail for this. They'll use this to put me in the electric chair down at Stragview! They'll think I murdered those kids!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny shook his head, \"There's no way you killed Fred. Ralphie and Terrence and I will attest to that. You were with us all through lunch, and I can't imagine that anyone would believe that a shrimp like you did that to Fred or Ryan.\" he said, holding open the book to the pages in question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was stunned, unsure what to do, and when he laughed again, I found myself laughing right along with him. How had I not seen this? They could testify that I hadn't been anywhere near either of those boys. The GPS on my phone could tell the police I had been at home all afternoon. There was no way to link me to any of this. I was safe.\n\n\"Come on,\" Danny said, \"Come hang out at my house till your mom gets home. Then I'll walk you home just to make sure that ole Billy Gumballs doesn't get you.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe laughed about it all the way to his house, cracking jokes as we talked about the character. Danny said he had some ideas for what Billy could do next, though we'd have to keep real people out of the story this time. We couldn't have the police trying to claim we were killing people through fiction, he said, and then both of us were laughing all over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we came up the stairs to his room, I told him I was going to use the bathroom and I'd catch him up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Well, don't take too long. I'm gonna get some Dead By Daylight going so we can play co-op.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said that sounded great, and we parted ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was standing at the toilet when I suddenly remembered something. In the comic, Danny had gotten away in the end, but Billy had been waiting for him when he came home. He had come out of his closet, I reflected, and smashed his head after sneaking up on him from behind. I started to run to him, but I stopped as I zipped my pants, remembering what Danny had said. It was just a coincidence. Nothing like that happened. Heck, I thought as I flushed, I bet Justin was safe and sound at his house as I was thinking about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shook my head as I let the water flow over my hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuch an idiot, I had gotten myself all worked up over nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I heard him scream from the room next door, I came tearing out of the bathroom as my flimsy hope fell apart. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came running into the room, my hands still dripping water, and that's when I saw him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDanny was sitting at his desk, the controller in his hand, with his head collapsed into his chest. Someone had driven his head in like a nail, and the perpetrator was still standing behind him, looking at me guiltily as he turned towards the door. I thought I was dreaming, that I was hallucinating, but as we stood looking at each other, I had to come to terms with his realness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis head was bald, his skin was pale, and his cheeks looked like a squirrel preparing for winter. He wore overalls without a shirt under them, and gum rubber boots that were black as pitch. His hands were bloody, covered in old and new blood, but even so, no one would mistake them for real hands. They were rounded, a pair of bulbous tumors that sat at the end of each wrist, and when he turned to run, I yelled for him to wait. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, he jumped out the window and was gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one has found Billy yet, but I think the police have finally decided I didn't have anything to do with it. They didn't care that I had written the comic, they didn't care how much I tried to turn myself in, all they wanted was to bring the killer of four children to justice. You didn't misread, Billy had killed Justin before he got Danny. They found him in the school too, his head completely parted from his body. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps, if I am the one who created Billy Gumballs, there's some way that I can destroy him as well."

My first job was construction, working as a carpenter's assistant since I was sixteen, and after the big layoff during the pandemic, I was tempted to go back. The amount of construction work hadn't changed, but the call for laborers had waned, it seemed. Suddenly, I was forced to look elsewhere for work, and my savings were starting to get dangerously low when the Fill-N-Go finally called me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst part about the job wasn't even the job itself, not really.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst part was the walk home when the day was done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lived in the Shady Oaks Trailer Court, about three blocks from the gas station, and it just made sense to walk to work. I didn't have a car, it was one of the first things to get repoed when I was out of work, so if I needed groceries or booze or a bite to eat, I was walking. It wasn't much of a problem, I like to walk, but it was the sights that made the walk unbearable, especially at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalking past Orwin Wood in the middle of the night was enough to give anyone the shivers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOrwin Wood had existed long before the children's home that had given it its name, but the long-gone orphanage was why it was infamous. Established in eighteen ninety, Orwin Children's Home was a place for cast-off children from all over. The rambling plantation home, lovingly donated by Mrs. Orwin before she died, boasted thirty acres, complete with a barn, fields for growing, a pond for fishing and swimming, and a lot of room for rowdy, growing children. At its pique, it had held some hundred and twenty kids and had been a place of new beginnings and fresh starts for many lost boys and girls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose were not the reasons it was remembered, however.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason it was still whispered about in fireside stories was the fire of forty-two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy nineteen forty-two, the orphanage had fallen into disrepair. They had some thirty-odd children they were caring for, and the consensus was that the fire may have been set for reasons of insurance fraud. Others claim it was a candle that was left lit after bedtime or a stray spark from the fireplace, but however it was started, the results had been devastating. Thirty people lost their lives in the fire, twenty-five of them children, and that was when the stories began. You could still see the ruins of the children's home as it hulked in the overgrowth, reclaimed by the forest after the blaze, and the area around the hulk was supposed to be haunted. Lots of people had seen ghostly apparitions, hand prints in the dirt on their cars, or had toys glide into the road without warning. The Orwin Woods played into a lot of local legends, and it was widely agreed upon to be a very haunted place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI explain all this so you understand why I might have been a little eager to get home on my evening walks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing strange had ever happened to me, nothing besides that feeling of unseen eyes watching you, until last night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night, I got off work to find about a foot of fresh snow on the ground.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt had been expected. I had watched it come down all day as I rang up coffees and gas for customers. I had walked to work through flurries earlier that day and had dressed accordingly. Still, I thought, as I pulled my hood up and turned to lock the doors behind me, that wouldn't stop it from being a cold, wet walk home.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dark gas station disappeared behind me as I started shlepping home, tonight's cigarette already between my teeth. It's a terrible habit, I know, but it's about the only vise I can afford to have these days. Tonight, however, I was having a hell of a time getting the tip lit. Every time I would lift my lighter to spark it, the wind would pick up and blow my little flame out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCold as it was, however, the shiver that passed up my neck had nothing to do with it as I came even with Orwin Woods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried not to look as I walked past, the forest a dark shadow on my left. Like almost any night, I could already feel those phantom eyes as they marked my passing, and I kept my gaze firmly ahead. My Grandma had always told me that when you sense the supernatural taking notice of you, it's best not to let it know you see it. \"Some things don't like being seen, Bug. Remember that,\" she would say, and it made a lot of sense on nights like tonight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was still trying to get the cigarette to kindle, but the wind was keeping me from my evening smoke. I put a hand up to block it, but it seemed my fingers weren't even a good enough barrier for the capricious gusts. The unlit cigarette was a good distraction from the creepy woods, however, though maybe a little too good. If it hadn't been for the snow, I would have walked home without incident, but I supposed I could have also unknowingly let something follow me in too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly I was done with the games. I was jonesing for a smoke, and I bent almost double as I tried to spark the tip. Three clicks and a lot of cursing later, I managed to get the flame to stick, but as I took that first long drag of gaseous pleasure, I noticed something beside me on the sidewalk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a pair of footprints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, not just any footprints, a pair of children's footprints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't mean shoe prints, either. I could count the individual toes on these prints, and there was a line of them beside my much larger ones. I didn't know when they had picked up my trail, and I didn't really care, either. Whoever had made them had disappeared, and I looked around curiously. It was twenty-three degrees outside, so my phone said when I left the station, and I was looking for the kid bold enough to walk barefoot in the snow. There was no one, though, and no footprints going hastily away from mine, either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was alone in the snow, though the fact that they had stopped right next to my own let me know I might not be as alone as I thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI glanced back, wanting to see if I'd been mistaken, and that's when I saw the second set. They had stopped about five feet behind me, but they were just as plain as the first set. As the wind hit me again, I tried to keep my teeth from chattering. The chill I felt had nothing to do with the weather, and I found my eyes drawn to the new prints as they waited patiently for some sign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo perfect pairs of tiny feet, sitting placidly in the powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, before my eyes, a third set came crunching toward me, and my cigarette made an angry hiss as it hit the fresh snow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was running before that third set came even with the second, and this seemed to be the sign they had been waiting for. I heard those bare feet as they slapped wetly at the concrete behind me. My head cried out for caution, it would be very easy to take a tumble out here and get hurt, but my desire to get away was up and my adrenaline was coursing in the face of this formless threat. I slid as I rounded the corner, but my sneakers held purchase as I kept showing my heels. I could feel the burn in my chest as I ran, my breath steaming like a loco as I ran for my life, and I knew if they caught me, I would never see home again. None of the stories I ever heard about the woods spoke of the children hurting anyone, but by the sounds of their ghostly feet, I guessed they weren't trying to sell me cookies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the sound of it, there were more than a dozen after me, and I could just imagine the intentions of this legion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw the trailer park coming into sight, but that seemed to be where my luck ran out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came off the curb, running flat out, and when I hit the patch of ice, I stumbled and went down hard on my outstretched hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was lucky, I suppose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I had hit my head and gone unconscious, there's no telling if I would have ever woken up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs it was, I just gashed my hands on the concrete beneath. I could still hear them behind me, getting closer and closer, and I walked on my hands and knees until I got across the street and managed to right myself. I was running up the narrow walkway, dashing between the trailers as I saw my faded red one coming into sight. I prayed the stairs wouldn't be icy, and when my foot touched down on the first step, I was rewarded with a groan and the firmness of unfrozen wood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI darted up the steps, crossed the porch, and rammed the key into the lock as I frantically walked into the entryway. I sighed in relief, I was home, and nothing could hurt me here. I turned to slam the door, the screen door not feeling quite firm enough, but my hand stopped.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw my breath as it came puffing out, and it felt as if it were thicker than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were dozens of footprints in the snow outside my trailer. Some were in the yard, some were on the porch, but all of them led to my front door. It was as if all those kids had followed me home, each of them beckoning to be let inside so they could come out of the cold. I could just picture a dozen or more half-burnt children, the snow falling on their ruined skin, looking hopefully at me as if just asking for a place by the fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was all too much, and when I slammed the door shut, there was a note of finality to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI made a mental note that night to try and find a new route home, but the situation, it seemed, fixed itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was awoken at six am the next day by my boss, telling me that Dixie, his day manager, had called to tell him she quit that morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Run off with her damn boyfriend, and good riddance I say. You've been a solid night guy, but I figured I'd offer you a chance to come work days if you want. The position comes with an extra three bucks an hour, but you'd have to start today. Interested?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was, and the forest seemed a lot less spooky in the daylight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't encountered any more phantom footprints after that night, but I'll never forget how the ghostly mob chased me home one cold February night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

I was in Arizona, taking in a local festival when my editor asked if I would investigate a Mesa about three hours away. I wasn’t really on board, I had met someone at the festival and was looking forward to spending a couple of days with them, but when I saw the advance check he sent along I was excited to get underway.\n\n\nI know, I know, but I have bills to pay, too, and festivals come and go.\n\n\n So, I hopped in my rental car and headed to The Lost Dutchman State Park near Phoenix. The state park is pretty interesting. Lots of red rock and cacti, kind of reminding me of old westerns I used to watch with my grandpa. There are a lot of Buttes, and you have to be careful about critters getting into your campsite, like most places out in the desert. The instructions I was given were for a particular canyon with a name that was nearly unpronounceable to me. I’ll have to type it out phonetically when I go to write the article, but the native Americans who lived in the area called it Watcher Ridge. Apparently, lots of campers in the area had reported seeing strange figures up on the ridge that surrounded the valley, and it was supposed to be pretty cool, if not a little spooky.\n\n\nI asked some of the park Rangers about it, and they told me they had never seen anything like that, but anything was possible.\n\n\n“You do see weird stuff out here from time to time,” one of the park rangers told me, “ and you do get kids who come out here to use drugs sometimes, not that that would change their experience. These are old places, and sometimes they are home to old things. Watch yourself out there and make sure you’re being safe.”\n\n\nI asked him if he had any advice for capturing photos of the watchers, and I wish I had listened to what he said.\n\n\n“My advice is that I wouldn’t. Things like that don’t like to be looked at for too long, and they certainly don’t like having their picture taken. Do yourself a favor, young man, take some pictures of the Butte, do a little camping, and see your watcher, but only write about what you see. People go missing out there, and it could always be because they decided to take more than memories home with them.”\n\n\nI drove the car down into the canyon and by nightfall, I had a firepit dug and my tent pitched. I walked around a little as the afternoon grew shadows, taking pictures of wildlife and the gorgeous views. It was hard not to feel intimidated by the towering buttes that surrounded my campsite, and I took a lot of pictures. As the sun set, I made my way back to my tent and started making inroads on dinner.\n\n\nI sat by the fire a little while later and watched the sky come to life. It was a beautiful night, the stars spreading out before me like a tapestry, and I was feeling cozy as I sat beside my fire and took it all in. I still hadn't seen any watchers, but the reports I had said they didn't come out till later. It was early spring, and the next closest fire was a little dot on the horizon. It felt like I had the park to myself, and as I sat looking at the stars, I thought that if the watchers had this kind of view every night then it was no wonder they stayed.\n\n\nSpeaking of the watchers, I kept an eye out for them as the night grew late, but I didn't see any. I had made sure to put myself amidst three large buttes which was the best place to see them, or so said the accounts, and while they were quite imposing, I had yet to glimpse one of these mysterious figures. I reached for my phone and opened the email I'd gotten, looking over the accounts that my editor had been sent.\n\n\nThere were three, one from a solo hiker, one from a couple on a camping trip, and one from a group of college students who had come out to party.\n\n\nThe solo hiker, who called himself Frank, talked about stopping for the night in the valley and seeing the figures on the cliff side. He had been camping in the valley where I was now, just his sleeping bag and the stars when he had noticed some weird shapes on the rock wall. They were vaguely humanoid, or at least human-shaped, and had been watching him intently. He couldn't tell much about them, but they had looked like shadows that had just been cast up onto the rock wall. He had ignored them and they had watched him right back and when he'd woken up the next day, they were gone.\n\n\nThe couple had said much the same, except that when her husband had flashed his lantern at them, more had appeared on the adjoining butte. Her husband had thought it was funny then, and kept flashing his lantern at them until the ledge was ringed in shadowy figures. His wife had begged him to stop before it got that far, and as they sat in the canyon and watched the gathered shadows look down at them intently, the mood had begun to shift. Suddenly it wasn't quite so much fun with all those ominous eyes on them, and the couple had packed up in a hurry and stayed at a Howard Johnson that night.\n\n\nI looked up before reading the last one, checking to see if they had come while I was doing research, but no such luck.\n\n\nThe third account was by far the strangest.\n\n\nA bunch of college kids from the University of Arizona had come out to camp for the weekend and pursue academic matters in the desert.\n\n\nAnd by that, I mean they came out here to drink beer, bother people who had come for a quiet weekend, and generally be a nuisance for the park service. They had set up about five tents, two barbecues, and tried to set up a volleyball net before the park service stopped them. They had requested the spaces for the weekend, but they had only lasted until the wee hours of Saturday morning. There were four different accounts, but they all boiled down to one story.\n\n\nThe twelve of them had started drinking before the sun went down, and five of six of them were still drinking at about two in the morning. They had built a large fire, something they probably weren't supposed to do, and were sitting around it and telling stories or anecdotes or whatever. They were all three sheets to the wind, and that was when one of the guys had said they should tell some ghost stories. No one seemed to remember who had suggested it, but Parker was telling a story about a shadow figure that had dogged his heels one night as he went back to his dorm when one of the girls noticed the figures on the ridge. The boys had started out puffing their chests and saying how they better stay away from their girls or they would mess them up, but as the figures stayed up there, the group started to get curious. They claimed there were two at the start, but as they watched them, they noticed two more farther down. One of them thought they had binoculars in their pack, but as they used them to look at the assembled figures, everything changed.\n\n\nThe figures had started getting angry then, their shadowy forms moving fitfully as the four became eight, became sixteen.\n\n\nThe report claimed they had started coming down the butte, just descending like ants out of a hill, and the drunk kids had decided to put out their fire and get in their tents. All six had pilled into the same tent, waking up the two people already inside, and they said that all at once it was like something was shaking and pushing the outside of the tent. They could hear people yelling from the other tents too, but if anyone went outside, they never said. This went on for about five to ten minutes before it stopped as quickly as it had begun.\n\n\nAll twelve of the kids had went to check on the campsite, and they said it looked like an army had ransacked it. Grills were trampled, coolers were reduced to foam pulp, and the chairs they had been sitting in around the fire were metal and cloth hulks. The kids hadn't even bothered to clean up. They had got into their vehicles and left, leaving their campsite behind. They had called this report into the forestry service, refusing to come and clean their campsite, and were likely on some kind of list now. They would have to choose some other national park to trash in the future, I thought, as I stifled a yawn and reached for my paperback.\n\n\nI looked back up at the butte and hoped they wouldn't make me wait all night.\n\n\nI yawn again as I found my spot in my much loved copy of Clash of Kings and settled in to wait.\nThe longer I read, the more the words began to run together, and it wasn't too long before the book lay across my chest and I was snoring beside the small fire, my head propped up on my rucksack. The fire was low, thankfully, and nothing came up to inspect me, nothing with sharp teeth and a rumbling belly, at least. The night went on around me, the moon sliding across the sky, and if the watchers on the butte saw me, they didn't say anything.\n\n\nNot yet, anyway.\n\n\nI slept till around one, and when I jerked awake I was aware of little beyond how low the fire had become and how late it had gotten. I cursed, closing my book and stuffing it back in my rucksack as I sat up and rubbed my face. It couldn't be helped, of course. I had driven all day, set up a campsite, and then tried to stay up all night. Something would have to give, and I suppose my body would need to recharge sometime.\n\n\nI had turned to get my rucksack so I could take it into the tent with me, when I saw something on the lip of the butte behind me. It was a smudge, more like the idea of a shadow, but the longer I looked, the more I saw something hunkered up there. The moon was nearly full, the light casting everything in an ethereal light, and as I glanced along the ledge, I became aware that I was surrounded. The ledge was full of shadowy figures, and as they goggled down at me, I reached for my camera.\n\n\nThey hadn't liked when someone had looked at them through binoculars, but I needed a shot for the article.\n\n\nI lifted the camera, zooming in a little as I tried to get as many as possible in frame, but I had been careless.\n\n\nWhen I clicked the button, the flash went off, and in the dim light it seemed like a miniature sun.\n\n\nI could see them through the little window, the zoom pretty good on my camera, and the way the kids had described them hadn't done them justice. They boiled down the side of the butte, like lava from a volcano, and I grabbed my pack and made a run for my truck. I tossed the pack in, climbing behind the wheel as I keyed the engine and peeled out of the campsite. It took me close to a mile to realize I still had my camera in my hand, and it took everything I had not to toss it roughly into the backseat. I needed those pictures, but I needed to be alive to turn them into my editor and get paid.\n\n\nThe moon was almost full, as I said, and it cast the flatland below the butte in stark light. I could see them roll over my campsite, and as they came after my car, I continued to floor it. They were fast, but after a mile or two, I stopped seeing them. By the time I got to the edge of the camping area, they were gone, but I still kept driving until I made it to the visitors center near the entrance to the park.\n\n\nI slept in the backseat with the doors locked until the sun came up, and then I went back to clean up my campsite.\n\n\nI was a little braver than a bunch of kids, at least when the sun was up.\n\n\nMy campsite was destroyed. The tent was wrecked, pulled up and shoved about twenty feet from where I had staked it. The campfire looked like a marathon had run over it. The little camp stove I'd brought was equally flattened, and I was pretty glad I had remembered to grab my backpack. I took some pictures of the campsite too. Might as well give the readers the full picture of what they might encounter. I cleaned up the mess, pilling it into the back of my rental car, and dumped it all into the dumpster near the rangers station.\n\n\n“Looks like you got more than photos,” came a voice from behind me.\n\n\nI turned to find the ranger from the day before, his arms crossed as he leaned against the side of the bus shed that sat near the dumpster. He didn't look mad, more bemused than anything, and I couldn't help but chuckle a little as I nodded. He was right, I hadn't listened and I had paid the price.\n\n\n“Ya, guess I should have listened.”\n\n\nHe shrugged, “Eh, I didn't figure you would. Some people just have to go looking for things, and they need proof to take back. I'm just glad you made it out in one piece.”\n\n\nI asked him what he meant, and he glanced behind him before stepping closer.\n\n\nHe clearly didn't want to be heard.\n\n\n“I didn't lie yesterday, I have never seen anything like what you're talking about. That being said, we do find abandoned campsites from time to time. It's usually people just camping in their sleeping bags under the stars, the ones who don't have access to a tent. Even a simple door seems to keep them out, but that won't stop them from pushing it. We had a fella get his RV pushed over a few years back and we had to get a tow truck out here to pick it back up. His kids had been stargazing and must have noticed they had an audience. We started telling people to be careful, but we haven't had a disappearance since last year and I didn't think they would bother you. Guess I was wrong.”\n\n\nI got a hotel not too far off to finish my article. The lodge is “rustic” but it still has HBO and a whirlpool tub in the suite.\n\n\nThe article is coming along nicely, but the memories of that night in the valley may take a little longer to finish with me.\n\n\nStay tuned for more of my travel articles, I'm sure I'll take you with me again sometime."

        "selftext": "Bill Meags was nothing if not a giving man.\n\nHe’d give you the shirt off his back, even if it was sewn right onto him!\n\nThis was a lifelong trait of his. In childhood, he stopped eating lunch once his mom stopped packing one for him and he had to start buying it at school. All it took was throwing a certain kinda look Bill’s way, or just making at him like you were going to ask him for his money, before he’d hand it over, *not wanting to get in the way*, he’d say, and he’d say it like he was apologizing, too.\n\nThat character never went away from Bill, no sirree. He was always real considerate, a sweetheart, especially to his parents – even though his dad saw him as a pushover (and another *p* word that doesn’t feel all that Christian for me to be repeating). I lived real close to him growing up, down the same block on Copperfield Drive, so we got all acquainted like kids that live close to each other at that age will do a lot of the time.\n\nMy bad, friend. I’m getting a bit lost in the weeds here, aren’t I? What I’m getting at is the generosity of Bill Meags, and why it is that you and I find ourselves in our situation at the present moment. You must be wondering about it, aren’t you? You seem like the curious type.\n\nA few more things about Bill in those early years, first. Bill, you see, was always sharing his toys with his brothers back in those days. Not a birthday would go by – Bill’s birthday, I mean – where his brothers wouldn’t make out with at least half of his new toys stuffed in their greedy little pockets. Far as I know, this went on as long as he still had birthdays at home.\n\nHe was never real popular with the ladies either, when we got to that age where liking girls and their nice legs and nice smells went from *gross* to *sweet.* Bill was not a bad looking guy, but he was not a good looking one either. He was just *there* most of the time, as much as it pains me to say. He was just about decent at school, not an ivy league contender or anything like that, but better than you woulda expected out of a guy who was like Bill – a guy that was just *there*, who looks kinda like he’d fit better standing next to a potted plant or the wallpaper than around other people. I think him doing well in school made sense. He got the reps in. As in, he had been doing everyone’s homework for them. No one had threatened him, there was never anything like that.\n\nThe rumor that was floating around certain circles at our school was that if you asked Bill if he wouldn’t mind helping you with your homework, and you made it seem like it would be just the biggest fuss for you if you had to do *any* of it, he would tell you not to worry, that he would get it done, and he’d say it like he felt guilty that it wasn’t already done even though he just had it handed to him. Didn’t matter the subject, he’d do it. He always denied the rumor when I’d ask him about it, but I was pretty sure it was true, and I think he wouldn’t tell me because he didn’t wanna break up my peace of mind. So, yeah, I think he was alright at school because he was doing homework for classes he wasn’t even *taking.*\n\nMe? I think it ended up being his helping his classmates with homework that led him to meeting Ana, a girl that took a real liking to Bill. Or maybe her name was Ava… it was something like that. Strange how time fades the clearness of your memories like they’re in a heavy fog, isn’t it? Well, in any case, Ava or Ana was a nice girl, and pretty, too, and she made her intentions real clear to Bill Meags, and that was unusual at the time, you see, for a girl to be that forward with a guy in the romantic sense. That was lucky for Bill, because I don’t think they woulda gone out if it wasn’t for her...\n\nAnd they did go out. For a time, anyway. Until Brad Something-or-Other had come up to Bill one day and told him he thought Bill was *such* a nice guy, one of those real generous types, and Brad was acting all like he didn’t know that Ana (or maybe it was Ari?) was going steady with Bill, and he was really hamming it up and saying how it would be just swell to have the chance to go on a date with that cute girl from third period math. Brad was one of *those* guys, you’d know the type if you saw him, that made you wanna question the Creator when all your knowledge of what it meant to suffer was that you were stuck at home again with your parents on Saturday night. He was a complete jackass – there’s just no other word that works here – but he was also gifted by God and genetics and growth hormone to be a *good-looking* jackass. He was tall, a jock, and had a jawline that angled his face in a way that seemed to slide the looks that girls would give him into the rest of his face. What I’m getting at is that Brad could go on a date with anyone he wanted, and *had* gone one dates with anyone he wanted, “gotten down” with girls in higher social brackets compared to Bill’s girl. And he was too plugged into the social jungle that is high school to not have known they’d been going steady.\n\nThis is important, you see, because even though I can’t prove it, I believe deep down that Brad was pulling a prank on Bill. But Bill didn’t see it as a prank, and Bill agreed with Brad, telling him *of course, you and Ana\/Ava\/Ari would make such a cute couple, you should go for it.* Bill didn’t wanna *impose* on Brad, and he didn’t wanna get in the way of their potential future relationship, he told me later. *Wouldn’t it just be awful,* he said, *if I were the reason they weren’t happy together? I can’t get in their way, I just can’t do that. That’d be just plain selfish of me.*\n\nThing is, this was 8 months into their relationship, and he was as into her as one got at that age. But he *didn’t want to be a bother*, *didn’t want to burden* Brad-the-Tall-and-Chiseled-Jackass, *didn’t want to get in the way* or *be an obstacle*, so he stepped back, and Brad and Ava\/Ana\/Ari\/Ash had gone on 3 dates before he forgot to wear a rubber on the third and knocked her up, and Bill was real outta their way when they both dropped out of school together to raise it. But Bill was heartbroken, he was, even though he’d never say it.\n\nAh, you don’t need to say anything for me to know what you’re thinking. I can see it in your face. I’ve been at it again. Rambling, haven’t I?\n\nThere is a point, I promise; a reason I’m telling you this and telling it to you the way I am. But we *should* fast forward a bit, shouldn’t we? Time is ticking, and midnight is getting closer, and I would like you to know why we’re here, hard as that might be from your perspective to believe.\n\nSo, fast forward some decades, and Bill’s married. His wife’s a presence of a woman named Martha. Now, lemme tell you, that Martha, she’s a force – both her and her mother.\n\nOnly reason Bill and Martha got married was because she asked him directly if he was planning to propose to her. Some 5 years into their relationship, that was. And Bill sure wasn’t going to tell her no, was he? That wasn’t in Bill’s nature. *It was about that time,* he told me after he broke the news of their nuptial plans, *that I got myself good and married.* Then, almost like it was just an afterthought, he added how he didn’t wanna annoy her, or make her feel all negative because he had struck the idea down, even if the answer woulda probably been *not right now*. So instead of saying *not right now* or *let’s talk more about it* he said *yes*, both right then and right there. She made him propose all formal with a ring, of course, but she was happy. Martha’s version of happy, anyways.\n\nNow here come the newlyweds, and not 10 months later, out of Mrs. Martha Meags comes their first and their only, a boy they named Artimus. Bill had wanted to name him David, but Martha wanted to name him Artimus, so Bill and Martha named him Artimus. The child was adored, I can tell you that. Even after he started getting hard to be around since he was turning into one of those mopey teens with one of those mopey faces who always talks about how no one could ever understand them. Martha told Artimus he could do no wrong, and she told him that even after he started coming home in the back of a police cruiser. He started with shoplifting, getting caught wearing expensive shirts and sweaters under the oversized hoodie he’d always wear. But because he was underage, and since Martha had settled into one of those clerk jobs at the precinct office (and because she had come to know some of the fellas on the force), the young and troubled Artimus would often come back home after getting caught, at least in the beginning. You best believe I prayed for that kid every morning and every night. But God helps those who help themselves, my momma always used to say, God rest her.\n\nBill, at this point, had raised the idea of sending Artimus to a disciplinary school over the summer break. The way Martha reacted you’da thought you told her she needed to sacrifice Artimus in some pagan ritual. She would hear none of it. She said her son was one of those boys that came into his own a bit rougher and a bit later than the other boys, but it was because he was sensitive, and sensitive boys need extra coddling. Bill had thought about how he had been as a kid and felt his son woulda been one of the ones to ask him to do his homework if they’d been kids together. I guess this thought musta sparked something in him, because Bill didn’t back down off the jump and he raised the issue again with Martha. Or at least that’s how he told it to me. In any case, he said to her that he was concerned that one day Artimus wouldn’t come home in the back of a police car, that he wouldn’t come home at all, that instead the police officer would come to their home without Artimus and tell them that their son was dead or dying alone in some cold hospital bed. She went into hysterics, said that Bill was completely exaggerating, there would be no way that she would let her son go off *canoodling* with delinquents and murderers and rapists and thugs. And so off to the disciplinary school their dear Arty did not go, and into trouble their dear Arty stayed.\n\nYou can see I’m shaking now. I can tell it from the way you’re looking at me. It’s because he’s getting closer. But I think we’re still making good time, we should wrap up just as midnight comes. But no more dilly dallying – because he *is* getting closer. I can feel him, and I think you can too.\n\nI think it started happening right around the time Bill had been in the running for a promotion. The guy right above him had been dropped by a heart attack at the ripe young age of 40. He survived it, but he was starting to take a good hard look at his priorities, as some men get to doing when they remember that the Almighty calls them back eventually. He decided he wasn’t spending enough time with his kids and wife and quit his job the day before his heart decided to permanently quit on him. So the position – Bill’s boss’s position – was open, and it paid pretty well, at least compared to what Bill was getting paid at the time, which was little more than peanuts. Didn’t matter how many times I told him, but Bill just wouldn’t ask for a raise. He didn’t want wanna offend his boss, or his boss’s boss, or make either think that Bill was ungrateful for his salary. That could hurt one of their feelings, maybe even *both* of their feelings, and the idea made Bill feel uncomfortable.\n\nRight around the time Bill was in the running for the promotion, his boss’s boss got real sick. I heard it was something with his diabetes, but the short of it was that he needed a new kidney or he’d die. Estranged from his immediate family, as it happens, which is not the spot you wanna be in if you’re in the market for a new kidney. He was looking for donors in all the ways he could: taking out ads in the paper, putting up a billboard you’d see taking the ramp off the highway into downtown, hanging up flyers on the streets, all that.\n\nBill read the ad in the paper, and it just so happened that he has a compatible type of blood and kidney, and he knows this fact about himself. Martha knows it about him too, and she also knows that Bill has been up for that promotion. Martha asked Bill to donate his kidney to his boss’s boss, that Martha did. Bill didn’t wanna give away his kidney. But Martha wanted Bill to do just that, and after she contacted Bill’s boss’s boss, the man who paid Bill’s salary had wanted Bill to do just that, and Bill was not going to disappoint Martha or his boss’s boss, so just that was what Bill did.\n\nThat was just the beginning. It wasn’t long after they did the kidney removal – the scar was like a big smile that ran from his middle belly to his right hip like a real big gun holster – that Martha’s dear mom was the one who got real sick.\n\nAh, don’t move. You’re starting to slip a bit, let me tighten that for you.\n\nLooks about right and good. Well, anyway, Martha’s mom was heavy handed with the bottle, that woman, and eventually consequences caught up with her actions as the good Lord makes right sure of, and she found herself looking down the barrel of life-threatening liver failure with the trigger half-pulled.\n\nShe would die if she didn’t get a new liver, or at least *part* of one. The doctor had explained to Bill and Martha near her mother’s room that livers were “adept” at regrowing themselves. Live liver transplants were becoming more common, he told them. You see where this is going, I think.\n\nMartha had wanted Bill to give away a piece of his liver. Bill had not wanted to. But Martha had, and so had Martha’s mother, and so (I think) had the young doctor who wanted to impress the more senior doctor. And so Bill did.\n\nThe liver procedure was a bit more complicated than the kidney one. Bill was far from spring chicken territory, but he wasn’t *that* old – so they felt he would be safe to get a hunk of his liver taken out so soon after having the kidney removed. But he lost a lotta blood, Bill did, and the wound wasn’t healing as quick as they wanted. Eventually, not enough blood was making it to his kidney, the only one he had left, and so his left and only kidney died. The doctor recommended they remove it before it got infected and caused him more problems. They assured him that his kidney would be used for research, so they could help prevent this from happening in the future. To other patients, of course. Bill would be on dialysis for the rest of his life.\n\nI went to visit Bill lots when he was in the hospital during that time. I was always the only familiar face to him around there. That would be the case until Artimus was a patient in the room next to him.\n\nArtimus Meags, dear Arty to his mother Martha, had been drag racing in a car that did not belong to him. He told his mother dearest that he was going to study at his friend’s house, and Martha had believed Arty because Arty could do no wrong. Blood alcohol was twice the legal limit, and he was not the legal age, but he could do no wrong. He had crashed into a park tree, and they estimated he had been going about 98 miles per hour, give or take. The car was hugging the tree, and the picture they showed us made it look like one of those abstract metal art exhibits.\n\nHow he survived at all was a mystery to us. They found him pinned under the spear of a tree branch that jabbed into the driver’s side window, with his legs folded backwards and over his head at all these odd angles, and the jagged edges of the crumpled car door were drilled through both his arms like rows of nails through drywall. One of the doctors in the hallway had said loud enough for me to hear: Artimus’s legs came in mangled strips, tendon and bone and muscle all mushed together… *indistinguishable*, each one from the other. They counted the one blessing that Artimus had passed out early – either from the pain or the booze – and wouldn’t wake up until after the amputations. Amputations, more than one.\n\nArtimus, dear Arty to his mother, no longer existed below the waist, beyond the left shoulder, above the right elbow.\n\nAt first, they were trying to save the left arm and the right upper arm if they could. The left arm, the doctors said, had some potential to recover, it was still getting blood and they might be able to salvage it. They said that on the first day. On the second day, the doctor had said pretty much everything except for what he was thinking, which was *well, let’s just wait and see, that’s all we can do right now.* On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead and Bill and Martha were told that surgery was the “mainstay of treatment for a gangrenous limb,” *but please try not to worry too much because they were making big advancements in fake limbs, in prosthetics, and the quality of life for quadriplegics was getting better, they’re even doing trials on limb donations! Of course, these trials were in the early stages, but they were so grateful for their generous donors who gave so much so they could do such* vital *research.* They said it was all above board, but when I got the chance some time later to actually look it up myself, I could find nothing at all about it online. When I called the hospital to ask them how the trials had gone, they acted like I was crazy. Can you believe that?\n\nAnyway, as you can imagine, Martha jumped on that real quick, oh yes she did. *Limb donations? Do y’all do them here? Bill had been so generous already, and,* now turning her attention to Bill and cooing in a way that always made my skin crawl, *oh*, *Bill, wouldn’t it be* so *wonderful if you could give the gift of walking to our son, to our baby boy, so that he could move his arms again, and grab at things again, and live his* life *again, like it’s all normal and this never happened. Oh, he was so young, wasn’t he? And you’ve lived a life, Bill, with those arms and those legs. Our Arty hasn’t.*\n\nMartha wanted Bill, the man with two less kidneys than you and me and a large chunk taken out of his liver, to donate his arms and his legs to their son. To Artimus, the boy who had moved only when he began to seize in his bed, who made no noise on purpose and whose breathing was being done by a machine that shoved oxygen through a tube down his throat, and whose eyes had to be taped down so they would not stay open and dry out because the part of his brain that gave his eyes the command to blink was asleep or dead.\n\nYes, Martha had wanted Bill to do this. Bill did not want to, but Bill smiled at Martha and said *yes, Martha*, because he just couldn’t tell her no. *It’s the right thing to do,* was his reason this time, which he gave me right before the operation when they were getting him ready (I was the only visitor; Martha was at Artimus’s bed). *Besides,* he added before they wheeled him away, *I don’t want to make Martha feel sad, or make her feel like I don’t love our son. I would hate to let her down… I don’t want to let him down, either. I can handle living without my arms and my legs*. *I’ll adapt, and better I adapt to it than he does.* I tried. I couldn’t get through to him, but I did try. So, then, he went with the folks in the scrubs, and that was the last time he was whole.\n\nHe was now without limbs, any of the four. His head sat atop his torso, and his torso atop his bed, and everything else had been sealed with some foam and some surgical duct tape. It was gonna be two surgeries, so they didn’t sew him back up on the first go. I was able to see through some of the foam packing they put on his stumps (the nurse didn’t do such a good job changing it, and Bill stayed silent because he was sure she was busy, even though he started leaking onto the bed), and I could see the sawed-off edge of bone splintered in uneven edges. I looked away right quick after that.\n\nThe next request came to Bill’s room pretty soon after that. It was sometime after Bill’s boss’s boss had decided to let Bill go from his position since he had taken off one too many days since he was in the hospital, and he thanked Bill for his years of service to the company. The requester was a lady who had overheard one of the nurses in the hallways talking about the *remarkable and generous gift* that the father had given the son. The mother of a young blind girl had come to Bill to ask him if he would be willing to donate his eyes and optic nerve, to give the gift of sight to the sightless, and she showed him a picture of her daughter, a young girl with blank sheets of snow for her eyes where the color shoulda been, and Martha had started weeping and saying that *of course Bill could*, and the doctor at the door who had overheard was saying that he had *never seen such generosity from one man* and Bill did not wanna give off the impression that he didn’t care about the girl like he was an uncaring type of person, and he didn’t want them to think that he wasn’t open to their thoughts on the best use of his eyes and optic nerve – *and,* he said to me before the operation, *is it really all that fair for me to have my eyes and the nerve that lets me see if that girl can’t? Do I deserve them any more than she does? That’s* what he told me, anyway. But I knew better, I knew Bill said yes because Martha wanted it, and the girl’s Mom wanted it, and the doctor wanted it, and it no longer mattered what Bill wanted, or maybe it hadn’t mattered for a while now, maybe ever, so Bill’s eyes had been scooped out, the space around his optic nerve taken out to remove it in one full piece, and the girl saw out of Bill’s eyes, and Bill saw out of no one’s.\n\nBy then, news had traveled quick. Local news first picked the story up, and larger media outlets megaphoned it out, and now there were hundreds of people showing up to Bill’s room in a single day, Bill unable to talk to them all but unable to get up and leave either. The hospital set up official lines and rules for these visitors – they gotta line up in this line or the other, fill out the official appeals form, circle on the diagram which part of the body they are in need of and from which body system, and give a response to: *In 200 words or less, explain why* *Mr. Bill Meags*, *the always generous Mr. Bill Meags,* *should donate his organ\/tissue to you or your loved one?* Bill, unable to read and write because he didn’t have the eyes to read or the arms to write, gave complete medical decision-making power to Martha and the doctors. He hadn’t wanted to, but he had been asked – Martha the one doing the asking – and it seemed to him it would really ruffle her feathers, maybe even cross into inconvenient, if he said no, so he said yes.\n\nHis skin was given to a 44-year-old firefighter who had saved a child from a burning building. His skin had melted clean off, several layers of it.\n\nBurn pains hurt. One of the worst pains you can experience, did you know that? All touch becomes real painful, a light breeze sets your nerves on fire, the cloth of your bedsheets feels like fire ants marching and you can’t shake them off because they’re a part of you.\n\nBut once the firefighter started wearing his new skin – the skin that they had cut off Bill like the pelt of an animal – he no longer felt the fire on his nerve endings or the ants crawling around anymore. They were Bill’s now, and for Bill, every second was agony. He never said so to anyone, and he never screamed, but he did tell me once when he was floating on a cloud made of morphine that he felt like screaming a lot of the time but didn’t wanna make too much noise. *That could disturb the other folks here. I don’t wanna stop anyone from healing.*\n\nHis right lung came out next, this one given to one of our state’s senators. The politician, one of those folks who make a real career out of politics and campaigning, got cancer in his lungs after smoking like a chimney his whole life, but he was running for a fourth term and he wasn’t ready to meet his Creator, so they took out his bad lungs and gave him one of Bill’s good ones. The senator was 75 years old, two full decades Bill’s senior, but that didn’t matter, of course. The senator’s third wife had pleaded to Martha, and Martha had said *yes* and *of course* and *Bill was a patriot* and *Bill always followed their campaigns the most close out of anyone* and so that was that and Bill’s chest had been opened and out came his lung. They took out the lung all the way to the place it forked into his throat, and I know that because they left his chest opened, they didn’t sew him back up, so it would make the next operation easier to do, the doctors told us. I sat by the bed afterwards – it happened too quick this time, and there wasn’t enough time between the agreement and the operation for me to see him off – and he told me, in between real deep gasps he had to take even with the tubes forcing oxygen into his nose and only lung, that *even though it was ‘an adjustment’ to breathe now, he woulda felt like just the worst if he went ahead and said ‘no, I’d like to keep my lung, thank you.’* But he couldn’t do that to Martha, he said, or to the senator or to the senator’s third wife (who the senator had ended up divorcing not two months later after he was caught in bed with a different woman. He won his fourth term). *Besides, what right do I really have to my lung? At least I have the other one.*\n\nUntil he didn’t, of course. But by then I had started losing track of which parts were being given to which people, especially with Martha doing all the approvals herself. Next to go was Bill’s mouth, which made conversations much more one-sided. They had gone ahead and removed both the top and the bottom rows of teeth in Bill’s mouth. The bottom row of teeth was removed with the jawbone, all in one piece, but I’m not real sure what they needed his jaw for. But they musta decided to take out the tongue while they were in there too, maybe so it wouldn’t just be hanging out of his face all the time like he was a dog dying of thirst. They sliced the tongue out, and when Bill would try and talk you could see the little sutures tied in the back of what was left of his tongue and it looked like barbed wire that was waving at you.\n\nMuch of those days were foggy, and it wasn’t long after that when I stopped going to visit Bill for a while, for which I hope to be forgiven when I get to the Pearly Gates. I couldn’t right stand it, see? It was becoming more and more difficult to see less and less of him. But Bill, silent and unmoving, was becoming an eyesore. They had started removing his muscles and some of the other bones in his face by the time I stopped coming to see him most days. One by one, his face started missing features, and that’s why Bill started to look less human and more like a slab of raw meat that got stuck in the gears of a slaughterhouse grinder. His head had become a skull with some of the muscles still attached in spots, muscles that would move like a pulley and lever system when he’d react to something because you could see them shrinking and contracting against each other. That was the only way you could tell he could still hear you because his eyes were scooped out of his head like they were two spoonfuls of ice cream, and his teeth and tongue were missing and his jaw was missing and the *entire base of his head* was missing except for the part that was attached to his torso, and the head was the only thing attached to that torso, it was. Not a pretty sight. I couldn’t right stand it.\n\nSorry, friend, guess I didn’t ask if you were the squeamish type. But… I’m getting used to the idea that it won’t matter if you are for too long, and that all this is for real and it’s happening. You woulda thought it gets easier the more times you do it, but it doesn’t.\n\nBill’s nose, the tissue that made up the full thickness of it, had been lopped off, and he now had no eyes and two almond-shaped holes where his nose used to be. His mouth – which was now a hole in the middle of a lake of exposed muscle – looked so little like a mouth, but it sometimes moved when he tried to mime out words that would come out as grunts instead. But that didn’t matter all too long, because he stopped the grunting and the miming when his vocal cords were out.\n\nBill, the man, the generous man with emptying insides and with no eyes, no nose, no mouth, who could not scream; who had no skin but the island of it on top of his head which made up the scalp that his hair grew out of like sprouting weeds; that man, Bill, existed here and there on the hospital bed, in pieces, pieces that were getting smaller, pieces made of tissue and organs that were going to be removed soon because some of it was starting to die while it was still on him, decaying and rotting like spoiled meat. Or at least that was what the doctors told him. But by then he couldn’t say or ask much.\n\nI am not sure he woulda asked much of anything anyway.\n\nOnce, though, while he still had neck muscles and could still shake his head or nod it, this young lady, some girl from one of the colleges around here, had come and asked him if he really agreed to all of these donations – as in out of his own free will. Willful consent she had called it, or something like that. She was one of those activist types, looking for a cause, and Martha wouldn’t’ve let it happen if she’d been paying attention, but she had been spending a lot of time talking to the doctor about how Artimus was doing. Since it was just Bill and I and the lady and cause his neck muscles were still attached and working at the time, he would nod in agreement to whatever questions she asked.\n\nMartha did find out later, and she was real pissed, you can bet on that. Pretty soon after that, Martha had the fortune of coming across the perfect candidate for the muscles in his neck, and Bill could nod and shake his head no more.\n\nIt was maybe 2 months when I saw him next, because I had the occasion to be in the hospital myself. Made it through, God bless, and I knew it had been a while since I had seen Bill, and… well, anyways, I had decided I better find myself paying my dues to make things even and all that. When I entered the room, it took me a good long minute to realize that there hadn’t been a mistake, and that I was in the right one.\n\nBill wasn’t there, you see.\n\nWell, he was, but he wasn’t.\n\nThe bed had been removed from the room, the bed he had spent the large part of a year not moving from. A table, like one of those you’d see in a high school chemistry class, had been put where the bed was before. And on the table were a couple of large devices and a small transparent tub with some water, the tub with a brain sitting at the bottom of it like dead weight. And then I realized it’s not water in that tub, it’s one of those preserving solutions with nutrients and electrolytes and all that, one of those solutions meant to keep the brain alive, to keep the cells in there from dying like they’re supposed to when the brain isn’t connected to the rest of you. The nurse told me in a hushed and awed kinda voice that the rest of Bill had been donated, so generously, and *wasn’t he just the most giving person you’ve met?* and *I couldn’t do that myself, but I have so much respect for him and for the people that do.* I asked the nurse if Bill could think and if he would be able to tell that I came to visit, and she looked at me the same way the hospital lady sounded when I called her asked about the trials. *No*, *I don’t think he can.*\n\nI stayed in the room a bit, kinda just looking at what was left of Bill. He was just a pink blob, with what looked like a maze carved into its surface. Bill was that blob (or he was in it somewhere) but either way he was an anchor at the bottom of the tub, kept alive by bathing in a liquid and being stimulated with electricity which came from a device on a timer to shock the cells so they wouldn’t die off from not being used, a blob whose body was everywhere and nowhere, a blob which was Bill’s or just Bill and who would stay sunk in this transparent solution until Kingdom Come.\n\nWell, I turned out to be wrong about that last thing. I read in the *Times later that week* that he had given (*with such generosity*) the two halves of his brains, the “hemispheres” – like Bill’s brain was a globe, and I guess in a way it was – to the children.\n\nApparently – and maybe you know more about this than I do, given how folks your age are much more on the internet compared to folks my own – some kids can be born with half their brain missing. And most of the time, those kids – being younger than me and you both – have the ability to regenerate their brain since they’re so young. So the half of their brain that *did* develop is able to do the tasks that the missing part woulda done normally. You wouldn’t even be able to tell they were missing anything.\n\nBut sometimes, the kids aren’t alright, the one hemisphere can’t pick up the missing one’s slack, and those kids with half a brain act like you’d expect a half-brained kid to act. They’re in beds, on life support, and often bleeding their parents’ dry of their savings. Of course, the money isn’t the priority, but you gotta consider it anyway. Bill’s hemispheres, both the left and the right, were separated and placed in the skulls of two young girls who belonged to the second of the two groups and had been on life support since babies, and each of Bill’s hemispheres had been attached to the half of their brain that the young girls were born. Each operation had taken 36 hours and I read they had neurosurgeon on top of neurosurgeon, all wanting a hand in the girls’ heads and their names in their paper and their egos inflated. ‘*The Times’* *sat down with Martha Meags, the late wife of the generous Bill Meags. She describes the difficult decision Bill Meags had voiced to her in his final days: to donate the rest of his body to those who needed it most. ‘I had to come to peace with it,’ she told us, holding back tears.* The picture on the paper showed a black and white Martha with a real solemn look on her face, like she was trynna be brave for everyone.\n\nI can see you’re shaking real bad now. You can feel him, too, can’t you? This part is the worst part – the waiting, especially when he gets close. And he’s terribly close now, no more than a few minutes, [but I think I got the time to piece it altogether for you, God willing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/gabrieldcstories\/comments\/19aizt9\/id_like_to_finish_telling_you_about_bill_meags\/)."

        "selftext": "\n“It is my pleasure to unveil an innovation in burial services.”\n\n\nThe investors looked uncomfortable as they sat in the hot sun on the edge of John’s latest investment. When the tech mogul had bought five hundred acres of swamp land, people had speculated that he meant to build another factory for his microchips. Tech magazines had floated the idea of everything from warehouses to a new robotics division and everything in between, but none of them could have guessed his intentions. His stock price had doubled since the announcement, and investors seemed to be holding their breath to see what would come out of Yomite Solutions this season.\n\n\nOnly his accountant knew the real story, and he had been sworn to secrecy.\n\n\n“Not a word of it to anyone,” John had said, winking as his casual smile spread across his face.\n\n\nWayne had snorted, “John, no one would believe me if I told them.”\n\n\nNow here they were, their eyebrow raised as he talked about not some new piece of tech but an innovation in the burial of all things.\n\n\n“Behind me stands five hundred acres of new growth, trees ready to provide mankind with oxygen, and many helpful species of insects and wildlife with a place to live. Beneath them, however, are the first in a long line of subjects in our Land Renewal Initiative. The bodies are infused with seeds, the seeds take root and use them for nourishment and, as such, become a sort of casket for the dead.”\n\n\nHe saw some of the squirming looks held by those gathered and decided to squash them.\n\n\n“Behind me stands what will one day be a new forest, a forest that will be untouchable thanks to the laws now in place. Think of it, every cemetery, a forest, every boneyard, a park, every place of death, a place of rebirth. This is the future, a future that bodes well for the earth and for the health of our planet. Welcome to Yomite Pines Memorial Forest, a place of peace and rest.”\n\n\nThe investors clapped. It wasn’t over-enthusiastically, but they clapped. They would see, in time, that this was a good middle ground. John had done a lot of harm to this planet with his factories, his smog, and his landfills full of obsolete electronics. If he could turn people's minds and grow a memorial forest in every state, it would go a long way towards making him feel better about his business and his soul.\n\n\nJohn Yomite, in fact, hoped to be buried in one of these forests himself one day.\n\n\nHe had no way of knowing how soon that dream might become a reality.\n\n \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n\nThat was the first night he had the dreams.\n\n\nHe was running through the rows of newly planted pines, the ground groaning as they grew towards the heavens. They towered over him, their branches grasping for the sky, and as they blotted out the moon he heard their whispers.\n\n\n“Join us”\n\n\n“Join us”\n\n\n“Join us in the soil!”\n\n\nThe ground sucked at his feet as he ran, the sand clung to him as if trying to hold him down, and as he jogged through the park he had created, a cold wind blew among the trees. He woke up in his bed as the whispers grew, and breathed a sigh of relief when he realized it had all been a dream. Did the water in his morning shower look a little darker as it went down the drain? Were there leaves in the pockets of his sleep shorts? Was there maybe even some mud he overlooked on his arms and legs? Maybe, but if there were, John didn't see them. \n\n\nHe shook it off as nerves as he got ready for the day, but it wouldn't be the last time he ran through the trees by night.\n\n\n * \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n“Wow! John, if you had told me that this thing would take off like this a year ago, I would have called you crazy.”\n\n\nJohn looked down over the forest of pines and oaks, their tops coming in as they grew strong. The glass window of his tower made the perfect observation platform, and the glass was thick enough to block out the whispers he sometimes heard when he walked the grounds. Wayne was going over numbers, but John was barely listening.\n\n\n“You did call me crazy,” John said, looking out over the forest of trees.\n\n\nHe had built this tower so he could watch the forest grow, and he found he was truly at peace when he stood up here.\n\n\nWatching them sway, watching them grow, it was all so different from anything he had done before.\n\n\n“Did I?” Wayne asked, “Well, guess I was wrong. This has been a bigger windfall than any of your previous endeavors.”\n\n\nJohn would have agreed if it hadn't been for the incidents that kept cropping up.\n\n\n“Who would have thought that people would pay so much to save the planet and be one with a burgeoning forest?” John asked.\n\n\n“Now if we could just figure out why people keep going missing we'd be set,” Wayne said. \n\n\nHe said it with a laugh, but John didn't really find it funny. \n\n\nIf it had been one or two then John could have understood, but what kind of memorial garden loses double-digit guests in their first year?\n\n\nThe large forest had become a popular tourist spot and people had come to camp and walk and take in the natural beauty of the new-growth forest. The trees were only about half the size they would grow to be, but there was still an impressive stature to them. They were the living embodiment of those who had nourished them, at least that's what the papers and some of the journals were saying. There were plans to grow more of them if participation was good, and so far it had been. People were interested in helping the environment and having a quiet and beautiful place for their relatives to visit them, and the list of people who had bought places in Yomite Pines would facilitate the buying of another twenty or thirty acres at least.\n\n\nIt had all been looking promising before people started going missing.\n\n\nAt first, it wasn’t anything to get too excited about. A couple of campers never arrived back home. An older couple that never returned to their car after a visit. A man who never walked back out the front gates after walking in. These things were odd, but not unexplainable. People did all kinds of silly things, and this was no more than someone who had simply decided to leave by another way or had forgotten to check out or, perhaps, decided to lose themselves on purpose and find a quiet place to die.\n\n\nThe kid, however, was something else.\n\n\nMarcus Le’Rane was six and had accompanied his parents into the little forest so they could “visit” his grandmother. They had walked amongst the trees, taken in the paths and little bridges and the shallow river that ran through it, but when they had turned to go, Mrs. Le’Rane had noticed that her son was nowhere to be found. She swore he had been with them when they crossed the little bridge over the river. She swore he had been with them when they stopped to dip their feet in the river. She swore he had been with them when they stopped at the bathrooms. She also swore that she couldn’t be certain after they had passed the picnic area and started heading back towards their car.\n\n\n“I don’t remember much after the picnic area if I’m being honest,” she said, her dreamy voice at odds with her tearful demeanor of the moment before, “I had been walking along, listening to something, and, for a moment, it was almost like I was hearing my mom talk to me. I know how that sounds, but I’m telling you that I could almost hear her voice.”\n\n\nHer husband had said something similar, though not the same. He could swear he heard people whispering just out of sight like they were sitting in the woods and discussing important matters. He described it as the scene in The Hobbit where the dwarves kept interrupting the elves' parties. He could hear them, but he knew that if he went to investigate they would all just melt away and reappear somewhere else.\n\n\nRegardless, neither of them could say when little Marcus had left their side, but he was gone now and they wanted him found.\n\n\nJohn stayed with the parents while the Forest was searched. He had set up a little command center near the visitors center and was directing volunteers from there. Mr. Le’Rane had gone out to help them at the start, but by sunset, he was back at the tent and sitting with his wife. The two were holding each other, both praying quietly as they waited for their son to return. They were upset, but John had yet to see them cry. They were afraid, but they didn’t seem overly fearful. He would have thought they were in shock, except that they kept looking into the Forest as if someone were calling them, before going back to their prayers.\n\n\n“This isn’t good,” Johne said under his breath.\n\n\n“You don’t say?” Wayne had said, looking at the parents as he pitched his voice low.\n\n\n“Be as glib as you want, but Marcus Le’Rane’s disappearance doesn’t look good.”\n\n\nWayne pulled him aside, out of earshot of the “grieving” parents, so they could talk.\n\n\n“Do you have any idea how many kids go missing in National Parks every year? Do you know how many theme parks lose kids without the help of creeps? Kids wander off, John. We’ll probably find him asleep under a tree somewhere.”\n\n\nThey did not find him asleep under a tree somewhere.\n\n\nThey didn’t find him at all.\n\n\nMarcus was the fifteenth person to go missing in the park that year, but he wasn’t the last.\n\n\n“We've had a hundred more pre-orders for the upcoming acreage. We sell the plots as quickly as they become available. It's almost like printing money.”\n\n\nJohn was glad that Wayne had forgotten about the kid so easily, but John found it a little more difficult. He remembered each of the names, each of the civil suits their families tried to file before his lawyers shut them down, and he supposed he probably always would. Wayne went on talking, but John couldn't take his eyes off the trees. The sway was so hypnotic. Maybe this was why people kept going missing.\n\n\nThat, or the whispering he heard sometimes.\n\n\nHe could hear it a little up here, but it was always worse when he was on the ground. It was like a slithery little voice that wormed its way into his ear, begging him to come and join the others who had already come to this place. And why not, he thought. They all seemed to have found peace here. Everyone seemed to find peace here. Maybe that was why so many of them came here to...\n\n\n“How's your mom?” Wayne asked suddenly, and the question jarred him back to reality.\n\n\n“Some days better, some days worse. She's fading, but she's going out slowly.”\n\n\n“Will you plant her too when the time comes?” Wayne asked, the question sounding uneasy.\n\n\n“I saved her a spot from the very start,” John said, looking at a place near the base of his tower here, “I grew this forest for her, after all.” \n\n\nWayne excused himself after a little more small talk, but John just stood there and watched the trees sway.\n\n\nWho wouldn't want to be laid to rest in such a peaceful place? \n\n \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n\n“It is an honor to stand here and ring in a year since the opening of Yomite Pines Memorial Forest.”\n\n\nThe crowd applauded excitedly, but as he stood looking out over them, all John could hear was the wind through the trees behind him. They were all pines here at Yomite Pines, mighty pines that grew lush and deep green in the hearty soil. In just a year they had grown past the projections put forth at the start, and John now stood beneath towering trees that had been little more than half-grown saplings two years ago when he had begun planting.\n\n\nHe shuddered a little as something else rustled against his subconscious, but he put it aside like he always did.\n\n\nIt was just nerves, after all, just like the dreams.\n\n\n“We’ve incorporated another one hundred acres, fifty of which have been donated by the North American Wildlife Foundation to help with deforestation efforts. Of those new one hundred acres, we have already filled fifty of them with fresh growth and new remains. The Yomite Pines Memorial Forest will soon be a forest stretching across the newly reclaimed land, and our world will be better for it.”\n\n\nThe applause from the crowd was much more enthusiastic than they had been last time. The thought of a forest of the dead had been a little sickening, a little spooky, but now they were behind him. His reforestation program was a big hit, and people were signing up for plots in the hundreds.\n\n\nThough Yomite Pines might be a big hit with the people, John was beginning to have reservations about the project.\n\n\nIt had been six months since Marcus had disappeared, and now his mother and father were also missing.\n\n\nJohn had once liked to stroll out here, just taking it all in and soaking in the peaceful landscape he had created. He was on one such walk, about two weeks after Marcus had gone missing when he saw Mrs. Le’Rane walking down the path towards him. Walking might have been a stretch. Shelly Le’Rane was wobbling like a drunk as she came towards him and looked like she was barely in the world. He called out to her, asking how she was doing and if there was any news on Marcus, but it took three such calls for her to look up and acknowledge him.\n\n\n“Huh?” she finally said, shaking her head as if she’d been sleepwalking, “Oh, Mr. Yomite. I’m,” she seemed to muddle through what she was before answering, “As well as I can be, I suppose.”\n\n\n“Did you come to look for Marcus?” he asked, wondering why she was here if she was still looking for her son.\n\n\nThe whole park had been searched from border to border, but no sign of the kid had been found. It was as if the ground had simply swallowed him up and left nothing behind. They had moved on to the surrounding scrubland, but John was certain he had seen the mother in the park more than once. The father had come in once as well, but that was the last time John had seen him. He hadn’t come back again after that and John supposed he was doing better than his wife.\n\n\nHere she was, high or drunk or both, and John would have to tell security to keep an eye on her.\n\n\n“Yes,” she said, looking off into the trees as if someone had called her, “Yes, it's like I can hear him when I’m here. He keeps calling for me and I keep hoping I will find him. Excuse me,” she said and stepped into the tree line as she went off into the towering gravestones that surrounded them.\n\n\nThat was the last time John saw her, the last time anyone saw her, actually.\n\n\nThe whole family had disappeared, and Scott, the security guy over the park, actually showed him a security video of Mr. Le’Rane coming in but never leaving.\n\n\nHe asked what John wanted to do with it, and John told him not to tell anyone about it.\n\n\n“He must have left in a crowd and we missed him. There is no reason to tell anyone about this.”\n\n\nIt was a tragedy, all of it, but as guilty as John felt, he couldn't have something like this sabotaged by one family.\n\n\nThis was his chance to make amends for some of the things he had done, to make amends to the one person whose opinion mattered to him.\n\n\nThat was the last anyone spoke of the Le’Ranes, but it wasn’t the last John thought of them.\n\n\n“The new acreage will be open to the public next year, once the new growth has had time to get its roots. Until then, I invite all of you to enjoy Yomite Pines to its fullest.”\n\n\nThey applauded again, dispersing as John waved his way off stage.\n\n\nWayne was waiting for him off stage, all smiles.\n\n\nMaybe it was because he was an accountant, but as long as the money flowed in, Wayne was happy.\n\n\n“Great speech,” he said, walking beside John as the two walked towards the tower.\n\n\nJohn watched as many of the people seated there took up walking through the park, looking in awe at the trees grown from human compost.\n\n\n“We shouldn’t be letting people just wander around the park anymore.” John said suddenly, “It's too dangerous.”\n\n\nWayne looked confused, but as John finished, he grinned like a shot fox.\n\n\n“How else do you intend to pay for park services and expansion?” he said, smiling woodenly.\n\n\n“It shouldn’t expand, it shouldn’t be open to the public. No one picnics in a graveyard, and no one goes bird-watching at the cemetery. The longer we let them walk the paths of Yomite Pines the more of them will go missing. We’re up to twenty this year, and it's probably more like twice that number. Something is happening here and you’re too money hungry to see it.” John said, now real emotion in his voice.\n\nWayne looked like he wanted to say something cutting, but he contented himself with a lame, “Says the billionaire tech mogul.”\n\n\nJohn rounded on him, “This has nothing to do with money, nothing to do with fame or glory either. I have spent years killing this planet with my selfish ventures and now it's time to give back. The planet deserves a chance to heal and I intend to give it that. Yomite Pines will sweep as far as I can push it, an untouchable beauty that will heal this world, but there's no reason people should be free to wander through it.”\n\n\nThe door to his car was opened and as he climbed in he gave Wayne one final, withering look, “I want to close the grounds by the start of next month. I don’t care what it costs, make it happen.”\n\n\nWayne watched him go, and he sighed as he watched him get smaller in the rearview mirror.\n\n\nJohn felt more at ease as he drove off. The incessant whispering was finally cut off, and that was good because it was getting to be more than he could take. Every time he came out to the Pines it got worse, but John still found himself drawn to the place. Most nights he dreamed about the park, and sometimes he woke up with dirty feet or muddy shoes at the foot of his bed. John didn’t live too far from the park, but it was still five miles or more. Was he walking there in the middle of the night? Surely he wasn’t driving, but what other option could there be?\n\n\nIn his dreams he walked amongst the trees, hearing the voices on the wind.\n\n\nIn his dreams, he saw people walking amongst those trees, people who were as thin as fruit skins.\n\n\nThey wanted him to join them, to come and be a part of them, and John found it harder and harder to ignore their call the longer it went on. \n\n\nHe knew that one day he would have to go to them, but until then he still had work to do.\n\n\nThis was a gift to his mother, to the woman who had been so disappointed with his actions but had never stopped loving him. This was his final gift to her before she left this world forever. This was the last thing he could do to make amends.\n\n\nThe valet parked his car as he pulled up to the hospital, and as he rode the elevator up to the seventh floor he wondered what state he would find her in today. She had been getting weaker as the cancer ate at her, and it seemed unfair that it should be something like that that would take her from this world. She who had marched against deforestation, who had gone to sit-ins for cleaner oceans and for endangered species, the woman who had loved the earth with all she had was going to be taken from the earth by something as mundane as cancer.\n\n\nHis mother was going to be eaten alive by something that none of his money could do anything about, and John hated that more than anything.\n\n\nHe came in to find her napping, but she opened her eyes as he took her hand and smiled at him.\n\n\n“How are you feeling today, Mom?” he asked, trying not to cry but knowing that his eyes were leaking.\n\n\n“Like I’m dying,” she said, smiling despite herself, “just not fast enough for the cancer's liking.”\n\n\n“We added another hundred acres to the park today. The ceremony was great, I wish you could have been there.”\n\n\n“Me too,” she said, her eyes dropping. She was so tired these days, so easily tapped out.\n\n\n“Mom, am I doing the right thing here? I know this is helping the environment, helping the world, but is it the right thing?”\n\n\nHis mother smiled, her face sad but content, “I can’t tell you that, dear. We all have to decide what's right and wrong for ourselves.”\n\n\n“I only wanted to do what would make you proud of me, what would make you proud to have me as a son.”\n\n\nJohn was crying, really having a good boohoo, and he didn’t care who saw it as he pressed his face against her shoulder.\n\n\n“Well,” she said, laughing hoarsely, “then I’m glad my pain could be useful for something.”\n\n\nHe just sat there with her, the two of them enjoying the other's company.\n\n\nJohn had saved her a place for after she was gone, a place where she could be at peace within the earth.\n\n\nHer final good deed for the planet she loved so much.\n\n\nShe would grow within the heart of the park, likely the largest tree in the park when she was done.\n\n\nShe would rise above all the others, dwarfing all the pines as she rose for the sky.\n\n\nUntil then, however, he would mourn her one day at a time.\n\n \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n\nHe was running, the soil mashing between his toes as he went.\n\n\nThe trees rose up around him, their voices high and beautiful. They called to him as he ran, asking why he was fleeing from them. They could bring him peace too. They could make him complete within the soil. The moon was a ghostly sickle over top of him, and as he ran over the muddy ground of the park, his park, he felt more and more lost.\n\n\nHe had built this place, had designed the layout, and it was unthinkable that he should be unable to find his way.\n\n\nThis was a dream anyway, he told himself. He was dreaming all this, no matter how much dirt he found on his sheets some mornings. These were all just nightmares, he reminded himself, regardless of the filth he found on the bottoms of his feet. Nothing here could hurt him, nothing could really get him, but that did little to hamper his fear as he ran.\n\n\n“Come to us, John. Come find your peace in the soil.”\n\n\nHis spine prickled.\n\n\nHad that been Mrs. Le'Ranes?\n\n\nHe took turns at random, his feet feeling heavy the further he ran as the ground sucked at him. The ground was hungry, and now it wanted him to go along with all the others he had given it. He didn't understand how it could still be so hungry, but it ate greedily as he sank more and more of them into the soil.\n\n\nNow it wanted him too, and as his feet came onto the sidewalk he breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\nThe ground couldn't get him on the sidewalk, at least he didn't think so.\n\n\nHe seemed to come back to himself as that thought came to him, and he realized this may not be a dream. Suddenly he was standing on the sidewalk, wearing his comfortable sleep pants and his sleeveless t-shirt, and staring out at the whispering sea of trees. He had found himself here before, wondering again how he had gotten there, and as he reached for his phone, he realized it wasn't in his pocket. It wouldn't be, would it? It would be on his nightstand, right where he had left it.\n\n\nHe looked at the tower and was thankful that he paid for night security.\n\n\nHe started walking towards the edifice, preparing to answer some questions yet again.\n \n\n* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\t\n\n\n“This is starting to become a problem, John.”\n\n\nWayne was pacing around his office in the tower as John sat drinking coffee in his night clothes. Scott had called Wayne for some reason, and John would have to have words with him about it later. John signed the paychecks around here, not his accountant and VP. Scott was likely worried that John was having a break from reality, John realized, but that didn't change matters.\n\n\nThis was still John's project, and he was in charge.\n\n\n“If the shareholders find out about this, it could be bad.”\n\n\nJohn laughed, “Shareholders? What shareholders? This project is being bankrolled by Me and me alone.”\n\n\nWayne shook his head, “I'm not talking about the park. I'm talking about the shareholders in your other companies. If they find out that you're wandering around in your memorial gardens every night, they might worry that you're losing it.”\n\n\nJohn shrugged, “Let them think what they want. This is more important than anything else.”\n\n\nWayne looked at him like he thought John might be crazy. \n\n\n“Talk like that is going to bankrupt you. I know you're torn up about your mom, John, but this isn't the time to give up.”\n\n\nJohn didn't say anything for a little while, staring at the coffee in his cup as it sloshed.\n\n\n“I don't know if I want to add more acreage to this place. I don't know if I want people here or not. The only thing I do know is that this work is important, to the planet if not to the people, and it needs to continue.”\n\n\nWayne left not long after that, and John was left to stare into his cup and wonder.\n \t\t\n\n* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n \n\nDespite what he had told Wayne, they added another hundred acres to the park.\n\n\nDespite what he had told Wayne, the people still came to the park.\n\n\nThey had a man-made lake now, three picnic areas, and enough parking for everyone buried here and then some.\n\n\nThey also had added nearly thirty missing patrons to their tally, putting them around sixty.\n\n\nThere had been many searches of the grounds, but no one was ever found. It had become quite the mystery, and as John drove into the park he grimaced at the graffiti on the welcome sign. People kept spray-painted Whispering over the Yomite on the sign and John had replaced it several times already. He would have to get Scott to check the cameras again, though he found the name extremely appropriate.\n\n\nJohn’s dreams had far from abated and he rolled his window up as the whispers tried to find their way in again.\n\n\nThey beseech him to come to them, to join them, and John didn’t know how much longer he could resist them. The dreams were drawing him out here nightly, and he had started waking up in the park more often than not. It was becoming more and more apparent that he was simply walking there at night, and there didn’t seem to be any way to stop it from happening.\n\n\nLately, however, the calls had been in a voice he couldn’t refuse.\n\n\nHe walked into the park, sliding in his airpods as he came through the gates and the whispers intensified. It really was a beautiful place. The Pines had come in nicely and they were growing tall and healthy. They stretched out from the gates now, a mighty forest that he had risen from nothing, and he was proud of his work. He was haunted by that work, too, but that didn't stop him from being proud of it. He had accomplished much in the two years since starting, but there was still so much work left to do.\n\n\nHe stopped by one of the trees, the one near the base of his tower, and looked down at the new growth already poking its way through the soil.\n\n\n“Hey, mom,” he whispered, “Looking good.”\n\n\nShe had passed about three months ago, not long after their conversation in her hospital room. He had laid her to rest here in the park, his last gift to her, and the placard he had put in front of her tree was his only real allocation for grave markers. Everyone else had a small number so their loved ones could find them, but his mother would only be important to him, and he knew it. She had been his last family, the only surviving piece, and now it was down to him to mourn her.\n\n\nWhen she had joined his dreams, adding her voice to the chorus, he didn't know how much longer he would be able to hold out.\n\n\nWayne was waiting for him when he got to the top of the tower, holding up the plans for the latest expansion.\n\n\n“We just got approved for another hundred acres,” he said, unrolling the property plan, “We should have it filled before June and then the next hundred filled before this time next,”\n\n\n“How much would it take to get another thousand acres?”\n\n\nWayne's eyes got a little wide, “I mean, some of it would be available through government grants, but the cost would still be steep.”\n\n\n“Make it happen,” John said, “I don't care how much it costs.”\n\n\nWayne looked at him oddly, “You feeling okay? Not planning to do anything...drastic are you?” \n\n\nHe seemed to have noticed how close John was standing to the window, and John couldn't exactly blame him for his concern.\n\n\nJohn was feeling a little hinkey, as his mom had been want to say, and he wasn't sure what to do about it, or what he might do about it.\n\n\n“I'll get the papers drawn up,” Wayne said, rolling up the survey charts, “I talked with Scott about the sign too. As usual, he can't find anyone on camera to blame it on. Just kids out for a little helling, I guess.”\n\n\nJohn nodded, but it was pretty clear that Wayne couldn't hear the whispering. He didn't get it, and probably never would. He was the perfect one to run something like this, though he would never understand the importance of it or the horror. The nights John spent out here had shown him where the missing people were going and had shown him his own fate as well.\n\n\nThe whispers would get him, one of these nights.\n\n\nIt was only a matter of time.\n \n\n* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n\nJohn was tired, but the terror made his legs move as the mud sucked at his every step. Maybe tonight was the night. Maybe this would be the night they got him. Maybe this was the night he became a part of Whispering Pines. Even the name had slunk into his consciousness. It was fitting, too fitting, and he could no more outrun it than he could the ground that sucked at his feet. \n\n\nSuddenly, the ground did a little more than pull, and John was up to his thighs in the hungry ground. Beneath the soil, he could feel the strong grip of searching vines and realized that if he didn't start fighting soon, the jig would be up. He yanked and tugged, his strong runner's legs feeling ineffective in the muck. He was losing ground, one step forward and two steps back, and when the paved path came into view, he waded like a drowning man. The roots tripped at him, dragging him back, but John pulled onward, working for the shore. Suddenly the dirt was up to his hips and he was wading through that fresh mud. He wasn't going to make it, he thought. The roots would get him, the ground would take him, and he would be with the dead.\n\n\nOne of his nails tore up painfully as he grasped the sidewalk, but he pulled himself up nonetheless.\n\n\nHe limped a little as he walked towards the tower, one of his ankles having twisted a little as the roots grabbed at him. John's steps weren't just heavy because of the ankle, though. John hadn't gotten a good night's sleep since he opened this damn place. He was exhausted, living off catnaps in his office, or the four to five hours he snatched a night. John was used to weird sleep schedules and had kept strange hours throughout college, but as he got older it became harder to maintain. He didn't know how much longer he could last like this, and as he came to a familiar placard he stopped in front of it. \n\n\nHis mother's tree was larger than it had been a week ago, seemed larger than it had been this morning, and the concrete bit into his knees as he dropped down before it.\n\n\n“Mom,” he said, the tears running down his face, “Mom, I don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm so tired. I want to rest. I want to,”\n\n\nWhen her voice shuddered against him, like the caress of a bird's wing, he looked up and saw her. She was lovely, bedecked in leaves and green, the queen of summer in all her glory. When she reached down to touch his face, her hands felt like flowers against his skin. He closed his eyes as he leaned into her touch, her words like summer sun on his skin.\n\n\n“You've done the best you can, John. Come, rest with us.”\n\n\nJohn nodded, pitching as the earth swallowed him up.\n\n\nHe should have been terrified, but the embrace felt almost womblike.\n\n\nIt felt so natural, like coming home, and John breathed in a lungful of soil as the darkness enveloped him.\n\n\n“Welcome home,” his mother said, and John felt at home.\n \n \t*\t\t * \t\t* \t\t* \t\t*\n\n\n“It gives me tremendous pleasure to announce the expansion of Whispering Pines Memorial Forest. The park has become less of a memorial, and more of a forest in its own right now, and I hope someday to see hundreds of forests like it instead of useless granite slabs that do nothing but take up space. I know if my friend, John Yomite, or his mother, Terry Yomite, could see how this project has expanded, they would be very proud of the work we have achieved here. I have watched this garden grow into a mighty forest, and I couldn't be prouder to be a part of it.”\n\n\nJohn watched as Wayne spoke to the crowd, telling them about the new backer who was interested in what they were doing here. John understood the words he said, things like the woman named Titania Thurston, the Green Society, and Cashmere Botanical Gardens, but they didn't mean anything to him. If someone was interested in his ideas, that was good. If they let the forest rot, he supposed that was okay too. \n\n\nJohn was part of the Whispering Pines now, and he supposed that others would be soon too.\n\n\nBeing a tree was probably the best thing he had ever experienced, and he was eager to share it with others.\n\n\nWayne still couldn't hear him, but he would, someday. \n\n\nSome of those in the crowd could clearly hear him and they would likely join them, eventually.\n\n\nJohn had time, after all.\n\n\nHe certainly wasn't going anywhere."

        "selftext": " \n\nDarkness prevailed in our community. No lights, no music. It was as though the year would not have a Christmas. Ours was the brightest, the place for carols and the inspiration for everyone's festivities. Not anymore.\n\nMy husband had always gone all out for Christmas and put up the most lights, inflatable snowmen, an arbor of candy canes and a life-sized Santa on our roof. We even had a nativity scene, although we were atheists. We just loved Christmas and it was always the time when our family was at its best. Year after year, after our son had grown, he had brought his family home for Christmas.\n\nThey had always made a card together, a homemade Christmas card in a gold envelope. Each was a treasure to me. I loved the drawings from the kids and the handwritten greetings from my daughter-in-law and my son.\n\nThey wouldn't be coming home this year. Not after the horrific accident. The temperature had plummeted suddenly after nightfall, and the light rain from earlier had made conditions just a little bit icy. Sometimes a little danger is more dangerous than a lot of danger.\n\nI wasn't sure anymore. The pain was too great. In the morning I wouldn't get out of bed, because I was holding onto the dreams of my son and his family. I wanted to live in the dreams, forget the world. I couldn't speak or take care of my home. I just wasn't able to move on.\n\nMy husband had kept working, and it angered me that he seemed to be handling it. I knew he was hurt by the loss, but he had healed, and continued with his life. I was never going to heal, for me, life felt like a punishment, like I had somehow done something wrong and deserved the agony of losing him.\n\nThe next year, at Christmas, it only got worse. Nobody put up lights. The community we lived in had followed us into the holidays, and we had stopped celebrating. They still had their Christmas parties, but we weren't expected to come, and nobody decorated. Part of me felt that too, but I asked myself if I wanted something different, and although I would have accepted it, I wasn't going to ask for it.\n\n\"I am going to put up the tree and leave their gifts under it.\" My husband told me. I just nodded and said nothing. There was some part of me, a little girl who had believed in Santa, that thought their ghosts might come at midnight and have Christmas one last time.\n\nI fell asleep watching a Christmas movie where they said that anyone can make a wish and it will come true on Christmas. I wanted to believe in that, I wanted to believe I could wish it all away. Then my eyes opened up and I beheld them gathered, just as I had wanted. I should have left it alone, should have accepted the visit and begun to heal, but I wanted more. I couldn't accept that was the last time I would see them.\n\nI wish my story was about how I had spent those sleepy moments on Christmas Eve with them, enjoying their ghostly visit and then saying goodbye. It is what I should have done, it would have ended the tragedy and allowed me to heal and move on. I simply couldn't let them go, and they even told me to let them go, but I couldn't.\n\nI loved them too much, and the pain was too great.\n\nA dark quest began, searching for a way to bring them back. If they could come to me once, they could come again. I did my research, my energy slowly coming back. After almost a whole year of searching, I found out about a relic that could grant one wish. Occultists online agreed that it was real, and all of them also stated they would never touch the thing, for it would grant a wish, but only at a terrible price. I became a believer in the Lazarus Touch, a mummified hand that had reputedly already raised the dead on many occasions for thousands of years. I left the house and drove to the city, finding the bookstore that had last held the object of my obsession.\n\n\"I am looking for the relic you sold.\" I told the owner of the bookstore. \"You advertised it a few years ago. Who'd you sell it to?\" I asked.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he asked.\n\n\"This.\" I showed him a printed-out screenshot of a dried-up hand. \"You called it the 'genuine' Lazarus Touch. Here's the final bid. You sold it.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to tell you who I sold it to.\" he smirked.\n\n\"Then tell me, is it real?\"\n\n\"It's real. I never used it, but it came from the Peabody Estate. Do some research and find out what happened there. You tell me if it is real or not.\"\n\nI felt a chill, some instinct warning me to stop myself and let it go. I should have listened to my instincts. I pushed past the mild trepidation and said:\n\n\"You seem like a man who will make a bargain. I'd do anything to know where it is.\"\n\nHe smiled evilly, and I was right about him. He was willing to make a bargain with me. I only had to sell my soul, it seemed, but I felt driven and alone, and I wouldn't let anything stop me.\n\nWith the secrets of the relic's location in my hand, I left him there, wondering if I had paid too much. I made myself forget the bookstore owner and focused on my quest. I took his advice and researched the Peabody Estate, hoping I could learn something new. What I read shocked and horrified me.\n\nI should have stopped myself. I should have turned back. I felt the first pangs of fear and regret, seeing the rumors of what had happened. I knew they were true, something about the man's reference to it had convinced me he knew it was all true, and I could feel it. There was an evil presence already watching me.\n\nThe decision to drive halfway across the land to get to the relic seemed irreversible, even before I left. I had paid a heavy price for the information, and I wasn't going to back down without at least seeing it, to know I could possess it and make a wish. One wish that would come true.\n\nWhen I arrived at the home of the relic's new owner I sat outside in my car. I felt nervous, unsure how to proceed. The malevolent presence that was haunting me seemed to be feeding on me, and I felt afraid of it, afraid to let it in. If I just turned back, I could let it go, but I thought about Christmas Eve a year before. I remembered seeing them, smiling and with me, ghostly but intact. My fears were overwhelmed by my desire.\n\nWhen the lights in the house were out and I felt like everyone was asleep, I crept up. I found the back door unlocked and I entered. I'd never done anything like that before, but I was desperate. There was no way they would sell it to me, not when they had paid more money for it than my home was worth. I had no choice but to steal it.\n\nI was shaking with fear when I found it. My instincts were telling me to stop and go back, to leave it secure under the glass they had it under. As I stared at it, I knew its power, I knew it was real. It occurred to me I did not have to steal it. All I had to do was hold it and make my wish.\n\nLifting the glass felt like a bad idea, not because I could get caught, but because I knew it would exact a terrible price. I was afraid, knowing the danger I was in, but I did not care. I had to see my son again, no matter what.\n\n\"I wish my son would come home for Christmas.\" I said. I felt its power, I knew my wish was granted. Dizzy, I dropped it and staggered and fell over. The noise I made alerted them of my intrusion. I clambered to my feet, my heart racing, and fled.\n\nAs I sped away, I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the old man who owned it. He had come outside and was watching me drive away. The look on his face was of great concern, rather than anger or fear at the burglary. He looked like he was afraid for me, not of me.\n\nAt home, I couldn't relax. My heart was still racing. Would he call the cops? Would they find me somehow? Those material fears presided. I tried everything to relax, I made myself some tea, took a hot shower, watched infomercials and pretended I would buy something. I fell asleep on the couch and my husband found me there in the morning.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" he asked.\n\nI wondered if he could somehow sense the things I had done. He was looking at me like he knew my sins. I just shrugged.\n\n\"I went out.\" I said. \"I'm home now. I just needed to go do some things.\"\n\nHe eyed me with suspicion, and I felt guilty. I went to him while he was quietly making some coffee and I kissed him and loved him. He forgot his suspicions, leaving for work feeling happy, thinking his marriage was going well. It was the least I could do for him.\n\nChristmas Eve was just a day away. Years had gone by, and a few of our neighbors were hanging their lights. I walked around the neighborhood, greeting them and encouraging them. I knew my son was coming home for Christmas.\n\nOn the night before Christmas, I sat awake, waiting for his arrival. My husband came downstairs and found me there and finally asked:\n\n\"Alright, what is going on?\" sounding worried, like he thought I had lost my mind.\n\n\"He's coming home for Christmas. He'll be here soon. He's on his way.\" I said.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Our son. He is on his way, right now.\"\n\n\"From his grave.\" my husband nodded. \"I dreamed he was walking here, from his grave. And now you are sitting there, telling me it is happening.\" he looked pale.\n\nColdness washed over me, a deep feeling of horrified dread at the fruit of my efforts. He was right, our son was walking through the night, from his grave. I felt sick, I felt terrified. I thought of the smiling visitants I had met last year that had lingered and then said goodbye.\n\nWhat had I done?\n\n\"What have you done?\" he asked me, a look of unrecognition on his face.\n\n\"I - I don't know.\" I claimed. I knew what I had done, but it was too late. We both just stared in horror as the clock chimed midnight. Just then there was a singular thump on the first step of our front porch.\n\nWe both slowly turned and looked at the front door, our eyes widening in realization and terror. What was out there was not our son, although it was him. Dead for three years. There was another thump, something shuffling slowly with difficulty up the steps.\n\n\"My god.\" my husband was backing away. \"He's here.\"\n\n\"No - no!\" I whimpered in fright. \"This isn't what I meant!\"\n\nThere was a final thump as the last step was taken by the shuffling corpse. Then it began to walk from the steps, across the porch to the front door. I wasn't breathing, sweat beaded on my face and I was holding up the couch's blanket, covering my mouth. My husband fled upstairs, unable to bear the horror of his son's remains knocking upon the door.\n\nEach knock on the door sent chills down my spine. I was frozen in terror, unable to respond. I just sat there shaking. It seemed to go on and on forever. I felt like I was in Hell, being punished for my sins. I'd never believed in such things, but I no longer had that luxury. I knew what it was like, to feel that torment and terror, without end.\n\nFinally, after the longest and most horrifying night of my life, the sun began to rise. The knocking ceased, and the corpse reversed its steps, descending the stairs and leaving me to wail in anguish and trauma.\n\nWhen I had wept and shaken, I forced myself up to go to that door. With nauseating trepidation, I unlocked it and began to open it slowly. There was a coldness outside, and a stench of moldy old rot. There on the porch, I saw grave dirt and dried maggot casings. The muddy footprints of the corpse showed its path through the night.\n\nI looked down and saw what he had left for me, a little dirt was smudged on the golden envelope. I fell to my knees and picked it up. I held it to my heart, and somehow, as I stared out at the Christmas sunrise, I was finally able to say goodbye."

We were all strapped with reflectors and little blinking bike lights, including Buddy who clicked and jounced with all the lights he wore. We were hoping it would protect us from the creature, but there was only one way to really test the theory.\n\n\nWhen it turned to look for us, we all charged, brandishing our lights and hoping for the best. \n\n\nWe had planned to run if it appeared to be going badly, and when the thing turned and took a swipe at Gale, I prepared to flee. We could always go get him again if it decided to snatch him, but it appeared our luck was on the upswing. When the Miasma reached for him, his hand slipped right through him and I saw Gale shudder as it passed harmlessly out of the older man again.\n\n\nThe Miasma seemed as confused as we were, but it couldn't seem to find a hold on any of us, not even Buddy.\n\n\n\"Okay, time for the real test,\" Gale said, turning off his lights and he grabbed a blanket off the floor.\n\n\nPulling it around himself, he blotted out the lights attached to him and stood by as he waited for the coming swipe.\n\n\nThe Miasma lunged at him, grabbing him with shadowy fingers as it prepared to slip back into the ceiling.\n\n\n\"Do it!\" Gale yelled, sounding the least bit concerned now that the time had come.\n\n\nCelene and I swiveled the beams of our lights and suddenly Gale dropped back to his feet.\n\n\nThe hand that had gripped him lost purchase, the fingers losing density, and Gale was free once more.\n\n\nWe laughed and danced around it, shining our flashlights and shaking our blinkers. We had done it! We had won a real victory over this boogyman who had haunted all of us in different ways, and it felt good to show the monster in our closet that we were no longer afraid of it. \n\n\nThen the Miasma loosed a loud roar that shook the rafters and quenched some of our excitement. Suddenly there was a lot of weird movement from the darkness overhead. The ceiling was mostly gone up there, and the shadows were moving like an old man trying to catch his breath. There would be no rescue attempt if more than one Miasma came out to get us, and I grabbed ahold of Buddy's harness as we made our escape. \n\n\nThey had started taking shape as we stepped into the bathroom, and we were all glad when we stepped out into the fluorescent lights of Celene's safe house.\n\n\n\"Excellent!\" Celene said, \"Now we know that we can fight them.\"\n\n\n\"If,\" Gale said ominously, \"It works wherever it is we're going.\"\n\n\nCelene gave him a stony look, huffing loudly, \"I can't think of any reason why we couldn't. Must you always be so gloomy?\"\n\n\nGale gave her a look, but I thought it might have been more sad than angry, \"You haven't been to the ceiling. Things work differently there. If this end of the line is anything like that, then we could be in for some trouble.\"\n\n\n\"Then let's go there,\" Celene said, \"We tested Jasper's theory and it worked. Let's go see what we're dealing with now that we have a weapon.\"\n\n\nGale opened his mouth to say something but closed it again when he realized there was nothing to say.\n\n\nCelene was right. We could escape right now, so why were we hesitating? I wondered if maybe it was hesitancy to throw ourselves in without thought, but if we could be back in the real world, then why not jump? The worst that could happen is that we failed, and I was no longer sure that was such a bad thing. The thought of just existing here for the next however many years sounded like hell to me. What would happen if I stepped out like Celene and Gale were preparing to do, to find that over twenty years had passed? What if I stepped out to find that fifty or even a hundred years had passed? \n\n\nCould I reintegrate into such a world?\n\n\nI didn't want to find out. \n\n\n\"We need to be ready when we come there,\" Gale said, \"We need to save our trick until it's absolutely necessary. I've got an idea,\" he said, walking over to the shelves as he looked for something only he was aware of, \"If we cover our lights then we can move relatively unseen, I think. Imagine their surprise when we take our cover off and bombard them in the hated lights.\"\n\n\nHe tossed a throw blanket at me, giving Celene another, and told me to secure a third around Buddy.\n\n\n\"He might need some help when the time comes. You'll need to help him, but it should keep him safe. We might find them looking for us before we get to where we're going anyway. If they know we can fight them, they might try to harvest us before we can escape.\"\n\n\nHe tied his own blanket on like a cloak, looking like some kind of low-budget Lord of the Rings character.\n\n\n\"Get whatever you're taking with you and let's get to it, then.\"\n\n\n\"Do we know where the store is that he's talking about in his journal?\" I asked, looking at Celene for some clarification.\n\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"but I think I can get us fairly close. I know the store he's talking about before that, the one that has snow in it, and I think if we travel from there we can find the place he's talking about. That store was as far as I'd ever gone, but it should get us going in the right direction.\"\n\n\nSo, we packed a few things, food, fresh clothes, and some weapons to go along with our lights, and stepped towards the bathroom for what I hoped would be the last time. I had found a harness for Buddy that made me think of the ones worn by service dogs, and I hoped that the handle on it would help me hold him if he got spooked. Celene reached for my free hand, taking Gales with her other, and before she stepped through, she looked back as if to take in her home away from home one last time. \n\n\nThe store had been her sanctuary and her respite for a long time, and though she hoped to never see it again, she also looked thankful for the comfort it had brought her.\n\n\nWe gave her the moment she needed, and when she turned back to the door, I could already see the snow building up on the other side.\n\n\nWe stepped into a winter wonderland and I smiled as the wet flakes hit my face.\n\n\nEverything here was made of snow, and from the shelves to the products, to the workforce, everything was nothing but glistening white. The Hermit hadn't been wrong, and I could see several androgenous-looking snowmen with red vests that had turned to look in our direction. The effect wasn't altogether inviting, and their dead-eyed faces reminded me of a horror movie I had seen as a kid about a creepy-looking snowman that hadn't been terribly friendly.\n\n\nBuddy clearly didn't share my trepidation, and I had to hold his harness to keep him from running off to play in the snow.\n\n\nWe stepped through again, and this time we were in a perfectly normal-looking store set for St Patrick's Day.\n\n\nWe traveled for a while, going through about twenty stores before stopping to take a break. We found Jasper's underwater store, a store made of concrete, and the store where Celene had found Jasper's prescription back when he was still semi-sane. We found a store covered in thick fog, a store that was a Pet Supermarket, and then we finally came to rest in a store that resembled a park.\n\n\nBuddy facilitated our rest more than any desire to stop, and as he ran and sniffed, we took a seat and talked.\n\n\n\"How many more do think before we get there?\"\n\n\n\"Who's to say?\" Celene said, \"Jasper wasn't very clear on how far he traveled before he got there, and really just named stores he saw at random.\"\n\n\nGale had his knees up against his chest, and he looked broody. This was abnormal for him, Gale usually being so gregarious, and Celene slid over next to him and put an arm around him as she leaned against him. He smiled, clearly appreciating the closeness, but some of that melancholy persisted. \n\n\nI rolled a diet soda at him and another to Celene, and as it bumped his foot he smiled and reached down to get it.\n\n\n\"What's the first thing you'll do when you get back?\" I asked, trying to steer the conversation towards something more upbeat.\n\n\n\"I want a nice long bath in a real tub,\" Celene said, \"If I never take another camp shower again in my life, it will be too soon.\"\n\n\n\"I want to eat food that I don't heat from a can or take out of a package,\" I said wistfully, \"There's a Japanese steak house down the road from my apartment, and I feel like I could easily spend the rest of my savings in there eating sushi and eel and still not get enough.\"\n\n\nThat got a laugh from both of them, but only until Gale really thought about the question.\n\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said after a long moment of thought, \" You told me that you stepped into that bathroom in 2023.\" he said, turning to me as if accusing me, \"and if that's true, it means that twenty-five years have passed since Celene and I came in through the bathroom. When I stepped out of reality, Bill Clinton was in his second term. The internet was still kind of a fad, and the cell phone I had was about the same size as my wallet. I've seen that thing you plink around on when you have downtime, and by the sound of it, that thing is more powerful than any computer I've ever seen. I still had five payments left on the Camry I left sitting in the parking lot. By now, it's probably been towed along with your little Gemini, Celene. My apartment has long since been leased, and my bank account and my house likely went to my ex-wife when I was declared dead after being missing for so long. Let's face it, kid. While you might have something to go back to, Celene and I are likely looking at bleak prospects.\"\n\n\nI wanted to refute this, but I really couldn't find any evidence to the contrary. How did I know that twenty-five years hadn't passed while I was in here too? I could be stepping out into the future as well, like Fry stepping out of his cryotube. The thought of all three of us, four, I guess, if you counted Buddy, stepping into an uncertain future was more than a little scary, but I knew it was the right choice.\n\n\n\"What's the alternative, then?\" I asked Gale seriously, \"Stay in here and wait to be scooped up by a Miasma? Live every day wondering if you're going to wake up being fused into a crystal? I can't live like that, Gale, and I don't think you can either.\" \n\n\nHe started to get angry, you could see it on his face, but he settled as the weight of the statement settled over him.\n\n\n\"As to where you'll stay,\" I said, \"All of you will stay with me for as long as you need to. You'll have to sleep on the floor, most likely, but I can guarantee there is less of a chance that a shadow monster will come out of the ceiling and try to get you.\"\n\n\nGale laughed, but he looked like he might be trying not to cry as well.\n\n\nSome of the old Gale, the one who had rescued me from the Miasma and taught me how to navigate the landscape of the Dollar General Beyond, came out in that laugh and I was glad to see some of the darkness that had surrounded him since I'd pulled him out of the ceiling dissipate.\n\n\n\"You know, until you came into my life, I always just assumed I would die in here. I never wanted to believe that escape was an option. How would one escape from a place like this anyway? Now it almost feels like there might be something out there for an old guy like me.\"\n\n\nHe raised his can in salute and Celene did the same, \"Here's to you, Alphabet Man. No matter what happens, I'm glad I found your message on my bulletin board.\"\n\n\nWe all drank deeply, and as Buddy came back for pets, Gale got back on his feet and brushed the grass from his pants.\n\n\n\"Let's get this over with then,\" he said, taking Celene's hand and smiling at her, \"None of us are getting any younger.\"\n\n\nWe stepped out into a perfectly normal Dollar General Store.\n\n\nPerfectly normal except for the strange language that everything was written in.\n\n\nGale nodded, \"This is it, then. No matter what happens in there, I'm glad I don't have to do this alone.\"\n\n\nCelene gripped my hand tightly, \"I hope your couch is comfy, because I think I could sleep for a week straight.\"\n\n\n\"There's only one way you'll ever find out,\" I said, grinning as we took traveled one final time.\n\n\nWe all grasped hands tightly and stepped into the dark space that we hoped would take us home."

We sat around the Coleman stove as we ate and listened to Gale's story, hoping there would be something in there we could use to help us escape. We had both been to the other side, but Gale had been there for quite a while. His insight would likely be instrumental in an escape attempt from the Dollar General Beyond, and, anyway, it was time for a sharing of knowledge all around.\n\n\nCelene seemed almost bashful around him, not really sure what to say. She was glad to have him with her, that much was clear and glad to have me and Buddy back too, but she didn't seem to be sure what to say to him now that he was back. They hadn't seen each other in what I assumed was a very long time, and though they looked exactly the same, they had likely existed for decades apart.\n\n\nAs Gale sat, the soup in his lap forgotten, he told us all about the ceiling.\n\n\n\"I know you've seen it, kid, but it's like an endless black-and-white store. It's THE store, I think. The stores we travel to just take their shape from there. The black and white stores can be whatever we want them to be, and by existing in them we subconsciously create the stores.\"\n\n\n\"But wait,\" I said, not understanding, \"You had been to the stores I had seen. You told me as much, and I saw your mark on them.\"\n\n\nGale shrugged, \"I dunno, maybe you just aren't very creative.\"\n\n\nThere was silence for a moment and then he laughed, breaking the tension.\n\n\n\"More than likely it's because I've existed here about a hundred times longer than you, kid. Even so, you've written down more than a few stores that I had never been to until you took me to them. I think the longer you travel the stores, the more you influence them. I don't really know, of course. I'm mostly just guessing, but I do know that the stores are taking more people than we thought.\"\n\n\nHe took a little sip of his soup then, but it seemed like it was more to wet the pipes than to fill his belly.\n\n\n\"While you were up there, did you run into any of the black and white people?\"\n\n\nI nodded, \"Yeah. To me, they looked like photo negatives, but I guess I could see them being black and white.\"\n\n\nGale nodded, \"To me, they reminded me of the old Tex Avery cartoons I used to watch, especially the ones that played toward the end of the lineup. The ink and paint sketches, the ones that looked kind of unfinished. That was what these places looked like to me, like unfinished ink tests from some production company. They moved strangely, back and forth like angry ghosts, and when I first encountered them I thought they might be part of the miasma's defenses. Once I got to the crystal cocoons, though, I knew what they were. Those are the ghosts of the people they've used to power the Beyond. We thought we were alone, but their just saving us for a rainy day. These stores are just their pantry, the maze they keep the rats in till they need more food for the snake. How many of the ghost people did you see while you were up there?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\nI thought about it, \"Two? Maybe Three?\"\n\n\n\"I saw about thirty while I explored, and most of them were children.\"\n\n\nHe let that sink in for a moment as he took another sip of his soup. It was chicken noodle, something name-brand tonight, but it had turned to ashes in my mouth. Suddenly I knew what had probably happened to Jasper's missing grandson, what had happened to Rudy and Margo, and what had befallen so many other nameless kiddos who had gone to the bathroom and wound up somewhere else.\n\n\n\"You called them cocoons,\" I said, \"To me, they looked like trees.\"\n\n\nGale nodded, \"They did to me too, at first, but once I realized what they were for I couldn't think of them as anything but cocoons. They hold them there after the Miasma gets them. They hold them there and they drain their life away. I say they take mostly kids, but I don't think they're very picky. They want life force, and they take it where they can get it.\"\n\n\n\"Then,\" Celene began, looking up from her soup as if unsure if she wanted to continue, \"why don't we go break these cocoons? We could smash them up and mess it up for this Miasma or whatever they are.\"\n\n\nGale had started shaking his head when she talked about busting them up, and it only got more pronounced the longer she went on.\n\n\n\"Na, Celene. If we did that, we'd be trapped here just like them. They'd have us cornered then, and it would be all too easy to just use us as a power source until we were used up. No, our best chance is to just escape and never set foot in one of these stores again. It's the only way to be truly safe. Once we escape, if we escape, we never go near one again.\"\n\n\n\"No worries there,\" Celene said, \"I think I've seen about enough Dollar Generals to do me for a lifetime.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" I added, and Buddy barked as if in confirmation.\n\n\nAfter Gale finished with his story, I laid out everything I had seen Outside. I told them about how the Miasma had been there too. I told him about the mushroom forests and the brackish water. I told him about the strange creatures I had seen there, and how I had found the remains of Kenneth. I told him about the Hermit's journal, and about the rain that had hurt me, and then, finally, how I had come to be back inside the Dollar General Beyond and how I had found Celene. They both listened, though Celene had heard it all before, and Gale just laughed as I wrapped it up.\n\n\n\"Into the Ceiling, into the Outside. You've just broken all the rules, haven't you, kid?\" \n\n\nI shrugged, \"I guess so.\"\n\n\nCelene then told us everything she knew about the journal, and about her experiences with Jasper the Hermit. \n\n\n\"When I met him, he was barely hanging in there. I got him some meds, there's a store that's basically just a pharmacy, and for a while, it helped him. He told me about a place after the snowy store, a place where the darkness hid something. He said there were lots of the shadow creatures there, the Miasma, but that he believed it was an important place. He thought they guarded it because there was something special there, but he was too afraid to go and see what it was. I think thats our way out. The Miasma are there, but maybe, if we're sneaky, we can find out what they're guarding and see if it will help us.\"\n\n\nGale nodded, \"Agreed. I think I'm more than ready to be out of this place. It's been a long time since I saw trees and grass and something other than shelves of goods.\"\n\n\n\"Well then,\" Celene said, \"We're in luck because I might have an idea on how to fight the Miasma.\"\n\n\nGale and I stared at her like she was crazy, and even Buddy looked a little skeptical.\n\n\n\"This would have been valuable information to someone going into the ceiling,\" I said, a little perturbed, \"The place where the Miasma LIVE.\"\n\n\nCelene shrugged, looking a little sheepish, \"It didn't seem like the time to test it, and, believe it or not, I haven't really encountered a lot of Miasma in my time here. I have taken steps to avoid them, actually, but while I reading Jasper's journal, I remembered something he had given me while he was still semi-lucid. He wasn't writing very clearly by then, and the pills didn't seem to be doing a lot for his dementia, but one day, when I came to visit, he presented me with a sheet of paper and said it was a first-hand account of how to fight one of the shadow creatures that lived in the ceiling. I put it away, thinking it was nonsense, but I looked over it again while you were gone and I think he might have something. The logic is sound, at least it seems to be, and I suppose if we're going to take the fight to them then it would be nice to have a little surprise for them.\"\n\n\n\"Quit stalling,\" Gale said, humor and intrigue at odds with each other, \"let's hear it.\"\n\n\n\"Well, he claimed that any light source could disrupt them, but only the point that the source was touching. He speculated that this was why the lights always go out when they come out. It's easier for them to move in low light or total darkness, which makes them more substantial. He has a diagram here too, though it looks like a bunch of flashlights taped together. He's pretty clear that this won't kill the Miasma, just make it less substantial. If it isn't solid, then it can't hurt you. At least, that's what he thinks.\"\n\n\nWe were both nodding, but I was still a little miffed that she hadn't shared this with me before I went into the ceiling.\n\n\n\"Tested or not, I could have used that upstairs.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said, a little exasperatedly, \"but imagine if it didn't work? You're counting on this hail mary and it doesn't work. I didn't want to give you false hope. Hell, I'm still not sure it will work. I'm with Gale, our best bet is to sneak into this place and hope to be missed. The Miasma here are supposed to be absolutely massive. Maybe they'll miss us if we can move quietly and find the doorway of portal or whatever it is that takes us back to our world. This just gives us options and possibilities, and that might give us an edge.\"\n\n\nI nodded, her logic making sense. It was definitely something I might have tried after being cornered by all those Miasma, and if it hadn't worked it would have drawn a lot of attention to Gale and I. We would have likely not survived if they had seen us, and not knowing had probably stopped us from doing something desperate. Buddy stuck his head under my hand then, taking away a little of my irritation as I petted him. \n\n\n\"Okay, so we need to go have a look around it seems like. If we get the lay of the land, then we can make a plan to get there without being seen.\"\n\n\nGale was nodding, \"That seems like a solid plan. We can figure out what's in there and form a plan of attack. I'd really like to test that theory about the lights too, and I think I know the perfect place for a test.\"\n\n\nCelene looked lost, but I was nodding as I realized what he was talking about.\n\n\nThe burnt-out store.\n\n\nGale wanted to use the burnt-out store to test a hypothesis, a hypothesis that had the potential to go very badly.\n\n\n\"We don't have to,\" Celene began, but Gale cut her off.\n\n\n\"No, if it can help then I'd like to know how much. If we're going to get out of here, then we might need every trick in the book to manage it.\"\n\n\nThat was when we began preparing to test Jasper's Theory. Gale has a bunch of these big ole seven hundred and fifty candle lights he's been setting aside, Something to light the place if the power went out, and Celene has a bunch of these halogen lanterns she's hoping will do the trick. I've been playing around with these super bright clip-on lights, the kind of things joggers use, and hopefully, we can make little fields around ourselves that disrupt the shadows. We worked furiously, though I guess we didn't need to. It wouldn't matter how fast or slow we worked, we were still stuck here in this timeless void. \n\n\nAs we worked, I couldn't help but notice little things about my conspirators either. They were working close together, smiling and laughing more than I had ever seen before. It makes me wonder if Rudy and Margo were the only secret\/not so secret couple at the Dollar General. I've been trying to give them space, Buddy and I taking a lot of walks on the back aisle, and I've become pretty close with the pooch. I wonder if Celene would mind him coming back with me? Would that even work? How does the return process work? \n\n\nSo many questions, but not many answers. \n\n\nSo that's where we're at now. I'm making this update while those two take inventory of what they have in both hideouts.\n\n\nI'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little excited. \n\n\nIt's a chance to escape, the best chance we've had so far, and if it fails then I guess at least it will fail spectacularly. \n\n\nThey're putting something together now, working on something that will help us combat the Miasma, and I should probably go help them.\n\n\nHopefully, there won't be many of these left to go, and I'll be back in the real world soon enough.\n\n\nTill then, pray for me."

I've been enjoying your comments (sparingly, of course, since I don't want to kill my phone), but this morning I found something to occupy my time besides watching raindrops. I had completely forgotten about the other journal until today, but I found it again when I was looking for supplies in my bag. Somewhere between a bag of crushed chips and a honey bun, I found the smaller journal that I had found in the bag with Celene's journal. It was little more than a battered notebook and it looked like it had been through hell. I still had Celene's journal in the front pocket, I was still hoping to show it to Gale, but I had almost forgotten about this one.\n\n\nI didn't have much else to do, so I cracked it open and started reading.\n\n\nWhen I was done, I felt that the info was worth a little battery power to share.\n\n\nThe journal is from Jasper, another victim\/traveler through the Dollar General Beyond.\n\n\nJasper, unlike the rest of us, wasn't looking for a way out.\nJasper was looking for someone, someone I had read about before.\nJasper was looking for his grandson, Jacob.\n\n\n\n**January 10th, 1991**\n\n\n**That date is just a guess, but it's the best guess I have. \nJacob and I have been stuck inside this Dollar General Beyond for the last four days.**\n\n\n**It all began because I had to use the bathroom. Jacob didn't want to come with me, he was a big boy and too old to go to the bathroom with his pawpaw, but five years old isn't really a safe age to just leave him outside while I do my business. So, we stepped in and, to our surprise, stepped back out into another Dollar General. I thought I might be having a senior moment for a second, but when we turned around and walked back through the door, we were in a Dollar General again instead of a bathroom. We found the doors locked and couldn't get anyone to help us get out, so we made ourselves comfortable until they opened the next day. None of the food packages were in a language I could read, but the food eats okay, and we didn't imagine we would be there longer than a night.**\n\n\n**After four days, I have to believe we have slipped into some kind of Twilight Zone place.** \n\n\n**Jacob thought it was funny when I told him we were stuck here, but I've started noticing that the food doesn't replenish itself. Jacob is building models and coloring, but the more I observe, the more I'm worried that we might starve here. I keep hoping we will wake up and find that everything is back to normal, but the longer it goes on, the less hope I have that will happen.**\n\n\n**The story was a familiar one, at first. Jasper tested the place they were, looking for a way out, and Jacob kept busy with toys and things. The two were fine, at first, but I could definitely sympathize with Jasper when he talked about the food eventually running out. When I didn't know how the place worked, I had obsessed over how much food I would have before I ran out, and I knew how that weighed on a person. They stayed in the DGB for about a week and a half before the entries changed, and it all seemed to kick off with the disappearance of Jacob.**\n\n\n\n**January 20th**\n\n\n**Jacob is gone!**\n\n\n**I woke up and he is nowhere to be found!**\n\n\n**I have looked everywhere, in every conceivable place, but I can't find him.** \n\n\n**I'm frantic, looking under every shelf and behind every box, but my grandson is just gone.**\n\n\n**I don't understand where he went, or how he would have left. The doors never open, and no one ever comes or goes, but I do seem to recall something from the night before the longer I look for him. It was something almost out of a dream, something half-remembered, but I think it might be an actual memory. If it is, then I know what I have to do, but I don't really understand how to go about it.**\n\n\n**Jacob woke me up saying he needed to go to the bathroom and I rolled over without thinking about it.**\n\n\n**Is it possible that he went through the bathroom door and crossed somewhere else like we did to get here?**\n\n\n**It looks like I'll have to find out.**\n\n\n\nI looked up as a loud rumble sent flashes through the sky outside. It had been raining for a little while, but this was the first time I had seen lighting. I didn't know if it signified anything, but it didn't seem to be affecting the rain at all so I went back to reading. I threw a little more kindling on the fire, the red stalks burning nicely, and went back to the journal.\n\nIt appeared that Jasper had begun traveling as he searched for his Grandson.\n\n\n**January 21st**\n\n\n**Still no sign of Jacob.**\n\n\n**I've been to three different stores, and I can't find him. \nI did notice that in the store I came to some items were missing that he likes to eat, so maybe he moved on after eating a little. He's only four. I don't know what he's thinking. Maybe he panicked after going through it and didn't understand or something. I don't know, but I wish he would stop. I'm so worried about him, and it's not good for my condition. I'm kind of hoping to find one of these stores with a pharmacy in it, because, as it stands, I have enough pills to last me a few weeks, but that's it.** \n\n\n**I have to figure something out in the meantime. This journal helps, but it's the only thing I have sometimes that tethers me to the present. I need my meds and I need Jacob, or I might have bigger problems than being stuck.**\n\n\n\nPills? I wondered what pills he was talking about, but I also wondered how he kept his journal on him while traveling? Did he have some sort of innate ability? Maybe, as I guessed from the talk of pills, he had some kind of altered mental state that made his traveling possible. Either way, it was interesting to read about it from other people's point of view. I had enjoyed hearing Celene talk about her journey and hearing from the crazy old man now kind of made it even cooler.\n\n\n**January 24th (I think)**\n\n\n**I've been traveling nonstop, trying to catch up to Jacob. I don't know how this works, but I haven't seen any sign of him in a while. The last time I went, I just collapsed in a store, and thank goodness it was a safe one. I went to one yesterday that was a cave and I found a creature living in it that almost got me. Thankfully it isn't very quick, or I'd be one dead old man.** \n\n\n**I know that Jacob is out there, however. I will find him, hopefully, before it's too late.**\n\n\nHe wrote a lot, and I realized that he traveled farther than Celene or I had. He talked about familiar stores, and stores I had never even dreamed of. He saw a Dollar General that was in a forest, the animals there wearing little vests and stocking shelves with products brought in by birds. He talked about a store where the products tried to bite you and seemed hostile. He talked about encountering Miasmas of his own, and how terrified he was that Jacob might have run afoul of them, and all the while I began to fear for his mental state. His writing got less and less coherent as he went, and I wondered what was going on with him?\n\n\nThen I turned the page and a label fell out that solved one particular mystery. He had abandoned the dates by this point, but I could understand that. It was hard to tell dates and days when you were traveling, but he had laid the label in here like a book mark. Maybe he was afraid of losing it, maybe he just wanted to save this page. I didn’t know, but what followed was enlightening.\n\n\n**I ran out of meds today. It doesn't seem to matter, they weren't helping. I need to find Jack, but I can't find any sign of him at all. Was it Jack I was looking for? I think so. He's just a little guy, he's going into third grade. I need to find him before his Cubscout meeting starts?**\n\n\n**I don't know where I am, but it seems like I've been here long enough that it's hard to remember where I'm going or where I've been.**\n\n\n**The journal helps sometimes. Reading it now it seems I'm looking for Jacob, not Jack.**\n\n\n**Jack is my son. Jack is grown up, not a little kid. Jacob is Jacks's son, my grandson, and he's lost.**\n\n\n**I'll sleep now, but I need to find him soon.**\n\n\nI picked up the label that had fluttered out and it turned out to be from a pill bottle. Donepezil was not a name I was familiar with, but the instructions were for the \"Treatment of dementia symptoms. That explained a lot. If the hermit had been suffering from dementia then maybe his state had deteriorated over time and he had become feral. Traveling couldn't cure him, but it could help prevent the dementia from killing him. There was still so much about this place I didn't understand, but the longer I stayed here, the more I felt I had a handle on. \n\n\nI kept reading, but it got bleaker the longer I went on.\nToday I found a store where it snowed inside. There were snowmen wearing vests. They tried to get me, but I ran. No sign of Jackob.\n\n\n**Today I saw a store full of water, but I could breathe the water. It was fun, but still no Jacob.**\n\n\n**Found a store made of candy. Jack would have liked it. Where did he go? I could have sworn he was with me when I got here.**\n\n\nThe book was full of little passages like that. Just quick asides about where he was going and what was there. I made some notes in my own journal, jotting down stores to look out for in the future...if I ever get back inside. I think I will, but it's just a feeling. I didn't think I could get out until a few days ago, but here I am, in the Outside. I kept turning pages and reading passages, but it wasn't until I saw something about going back that I stopped and read what he'd written. It was the most coherent his writing had been in a while, and it gave me hope that maybe he had found his meds.\n\n\nFalse hope, in the end.\n\n\n**Back home**\n\n\n**Back where it all began.**\n\n\n**It started when I traveled somewhere I probably shouldn't have. I don't know how long I've been moving, or how long I've been traveling, but I came across something terrible today. It was so bad that I may never travel again, even if it means that Jacob is lost to me forever.**\n\n\n**Today I found the end of the stores, at least I think so.\nI had been moving quickly between stores, feeling my mental stability eroding like a stone in a river. I was afraid that, journal or not, I eventually wouldn't be able to remember anything. Jacob, Jack, Rose, my home, my time in the Army, everything would be gone and I would just be a husk of myself. I kept going, not having any goal in mind, and eventually, I found something I shouldn't have.**\n\n\n**I left a perfectly normal Dollar General, the only real difference being that all the products were written in a weird language, and came out onto a plane of perfect darkness. The floor floated like the tiles were levitating, and they glowed like a kid's nightlight. Between the tiles was nothing but darkness, above me was nothing but darkness, and amidst the shelves of rocks and weird fungi, I saw a multi-faced crystal that hung above the floor. It was green, an emerald diamond with so many facets that it made me dizzy, and I knew that I had to get it. It was important, too important to just leave here, but I have no idea how I knew that.** \n\n\n**When I walked towards it, however, I saw something moving in the darkness and realized I wasn't alone.**  \n\n\n**It's hard to wrap my brain around, but the darkness there was so deep, so perfect, that the black creatures I have seen coming out of the ceiling sometimes looked like purple clouds next to it. They moved about in red eyes patrol, their heads moving fitfully to take in everything, and they were so big that I couldn't understand it. I went to the Empire State Building once when I was younger, right before I went to basic, and the smallest of them was bigger than it. The eyes swam in the sky, like meteors, and before I had taken a single step I was filled with an intense fear.** \n\n\n**I took a step back towards the door, and when I did, I remembered something I hadn't thought about in a long time.**\n\n\n**I remembered Jacob building things with Legos.**\n\n\n**He built cities and buses, whole landscapes of bricks, and then he pretended to be a giant as he destroyed them with big, comical footsteps.**\n\n\n**Looking up at these things, I felt like that must be what the little people saw as he boomed over them, and when I slipped back through the door, I came out in the store we had left.**\n\n\n**I don't know how I did that, maybe it's something you can only do when you've come to the end? Either way, I think my traveling days are done. I don't know where Jacob is, I don't know what's become of him, but when I stand before that door and think about leaving, all I see are those towering creatures that lived in that dark place and I lose my nerve.**\n\n\n**I don't know what I will do, but I know that it will have to be here from now on.**\n\n\nThere were a few more entries that I could read, but most of it was unintelligible after a while. He drew pictures sometimes, but sometimes it was just streaks and half words and weird not sentences. His mental state fell apart after a few weeks or months or however long, and eventually, he just stopped using the journal at all. Who knew how long he had been here, but I knew how he had ended, and I thought now that it might have been a mercy. The old hermit, Jasper, probably would have thanked us for ending his suffering. Or maybe he wouldn't have, who's to say?\n\n\nAt some point, while I was reading this, it seems to have stopped raining.\n\n\nI'm going to catch some zzz's and then keep moving.\n\n\nI'll update you next time, my friends on the other side.\n\n\nUntil then, keep your eyes peeled for strange bathrooms in stranger retail chains.\n\n\nSee ya."

        "selftext": "\n\nMy boss was smiling as he tossed the flier onto my desk. I could see Jasper and Marcus turning to smile at me as well and I picked up the notice and scowled at it. \n\n\nI’ve been at Farseer News for about six months now, but its far from my first brush with journalism. I used to write for a news source in Washington that I won’t name, they probably don’t want to be brought into all of this, and before that, I wrote for my college newspaper. That's where I received my degree in English and Journalism, and that was back when my future seemed so bright. \n\n\nI worked as a journalist for six years, but that was before everything went to hell.\n\n\nI don’t want to go into details, but it was a story that everyone said I should have left alone. I wouldn’t, though. I was young and still looking for my big break, and the story seemed perfect. It was, I guess. Perfectly capable of ripping my career to shreds. When it was all said and done, no one would touch me. I couldn’t even get a job cleaning toilets in a building with news ties, and I had thought it was over until the call came from Farseer.\n\n\nIt's a paper in Gavin, one of the larger cities in the tristate area, but it’s as far from DC as it gets in terms of journalism. Out here, I’d be covering cattle auctions, ladies' auxiliary bake sales, and state fairs. I started to turn them down, but after some rumination, and a lot of alcohol, I decided that it might be just the thing to fix my credibility. Maybe after a few years of writing about less sensational stories, I could go back to writing about serious topics again. I could fix my image, maybe find a little public corruption to open the shades on, and get on with something more grand. I could work my way back into the industry and get my name back, then I’d find somewhere away from politics and get back on my feet. \n\n\nI couldn’t have known, however, that the head of my department was someone who liked to screw with people.\n\n\nMy boss, Andrew, and his buddies Jasper and Marcus are as far from journalists as you can get. They all have degrees from the local community college in English or Journalism, but the dynamic around the bullpen is more like the one you’d find in The Office. Andrew is the Michael Scott of our department, handing down judgments and “comedy” in equal parts. Marcus is like a less likable Jim and Jasper is the Stanley, older and constantly sleeping through his deadlines. I guess that makes me the Dwight, and they don’t mind using me as the butt for their jokes.\n\n\nYou should have seen Andrew during my interview as he realized my credentials.\n\n\nHe looked almost gleeful at the prospect of having a real journalist on his team that he could mess with.\n\n\nCase in point, the flier he had just tossed down was for the closing of a local institution in the neighboring town of Forman.\n\n\nThe closing of a Discount Warehouse Store that had existed on the corner of Beck and Mills since the Depression.\n\n\n“What's this?” looking up from a story I was writing about last week's “big event”.\n\n\n“That's your assignment for today, oh Junior Field Journalist.”\n\n\nJunior Field Journalist was another thing that Andrew had made up to demean me. He knew I had been a hotshot columnist in the big city and decided to take me down a peg with the Big Stories he handed down. The stories were everything from Dog Fashion Shows to Pumpkins that looked a little like Elvis. He found these obscure stories seemingly from nowhere and he handed them to me with the air of someone bestowing great honor on a lesser.\n\n\nHe mostly did it so he and the other community college journalists could laugh at me as I went off to chase the story.\n\n\nI sighed, “Can’t anyone else do this? I’m working on the Governor's clean air initiative piece.”\n\n\n“Actually, I sent your notes over to Jasper so you’d have a free afternoon to give this story your full attention.”\n\n\nI ground my teeth and listened to my molars groan like sails in a high breeze, “You did what?”\n\n\n“No need to thank me,” Andrew said, grinning, “I mean, it’s not every day that a historic institution like the Discount Warehouse goes out of business. We want your full attention on this story so you can tell us all about the last great sale of this time capsule of Americana. Feel free to use that line, if you like,” he said, walking off as Marcus and Jasper snickered at me.\n\n\nThe whole thing just felt way too much like the actions of a cartoon villain.\n\n\nWith little choice left, I packed up my things and went off to chase the story.  \n\n\nI was fuming as I drove the thirty-odd miles to Forman. I was tired of being treated this way by people who had learned everything about news reporting from their high school AV Clubs. The stories that the Farseer took on were often fluffy pieces and sometimes even bordered on tabloid news. For every serious story we took on, there were a dozen others about beauty pageant winners, food-eating contests, or pieces just labeled “local color.” I was sick of being stuck with these nothing filler bits. What's worse is that they weren’t even anything you could hang a new career on. No respectable paper would want to see your name attached to a Drunken Fiddle Contest and no one would be impressed by my dissection of the Little Miss South West Regional Pageant. I had been hoping to craft this into a new start, but it looked like I would be stuck at the Farseer for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nThe money was nice, though, so that was a plus.\n\n\nThe interstate was fairly uneventful and I arrived in Forman without too much fanfare. When they tell you that Gavin is the largest city in the tri-state area, they mean it. Gavin, as it happens, has a population of about twenty-five thousand in a good census year. The whole area is very rural, which meant there were a lot of very nice cows and pigs to look at as I drove. Gavin has five restaurants, a city hall, a public pool, a drive-in, several strip malls that are slowly expiring, and a Walmart that is being outsold by any one of the five Dollar Generals in the area. There are twenty traffic lights in the whole town, and the rest of the roads are watched over by stop signs and good manners. \n\n\nIf Gavin is a big town, then Forman is a pothole. You can tell that you’re pulling into Forman because of the seemingly endless array of trailer parks on the outskirts. They have cute little names like “Shady Pines” “Whispering Oaks” or “Sunnydale” but what they amount to is a sea of plastic and chrome that stretches for well over ten miles. I’m pretty certain that the trailer parks are bigger than the whole town, but that's just a guess. As sad as all that humanity on display is, the town is downright tragic. They were once a thriving burge, I’ve been told, that relied mostly on the pulpwood industry and the small coal mining operations that took place in the area. Now coal is played out, the pulpwood is going out, and Forman is a town that seems unaware that it's dying. If you drive up the Mainstreet you can see more buildings for rent than there are open. It has a City Municipal Building that doubles as a City Hall, a working railroad that will likely outlive the town, and several strip malls with the usual collection of pizza joints and cell phone stores. A few Pawnshops and Hardware stores seem to be struggling along, but the only thing in Forman doing any business is the Moose Head Pub and the small local police force waiting for drunks outside the pub. \n\n\nI supposed the lack of business was why I was here, though.\n\n\nI kept expecting to see a Walmart or, at the least, a Dollar General or a Family Dollar but the longer I drove without seeing one, the odder it felt.\n\n\nHad Discount Warehouse been that big of an institution? \n\n\nI supposed the little discount chains would pop up like mushrooms now that Thriftmire was forced to loosen his grip on the region. \n\n\nDiscount Warehouse sat in a historical building that had once been a Thriftmire All Goods Store. Mr. Thirftmire, who I assume had changed his name for marketing reasons, had owned a chain of Thrift Mire All Good Stores across the tri-county area. They rebranded as Discount Warehouse in the late seventies and incorporated furniture and housewares into his business model. Discount Warehouse was more like a small Walmart or a Large Dollar General and the economy had started weeding them out in the late 2000’s. This was the last of the Thriftmire line, and today would end his legacy as a housewares and small appliance juggernaut.\n\n\nYou like that? \n\n\nIt’s the opening of my article, and all with nothing more than thirty minutes in my car and a Google search.\n\n\nI did a little more looking and discovered that the Thriftmires still owned the chain. Thriftmire Senior had died right around the time of the rebrand in nineteen seventy-eight, but his son was just as business savvy as his old man, it appeared. Jacob Thruftmire Jr. had been running his father's stores since he was in his mid-twenties, and he was still managing the stores well into his eighties. The article said that he had hoped to rebrand again and keep the business open, but the bank had other ideas and would not extend his loan anymore. The stores had been operating in the red for years, and the tab had finally come due.\n\n\nJacob Thriftmire had begrudgingly signed over his business to the bank and was getting ready to enter retirement.\n\n\nI felt for the old guy, but I supposed all good things had to come to an end.\n\n\nI wasn’t exactly sure I would call the parking lot I was currently in a “Good Thing,” however.\n\n\nThe building was a large brick box with a black awning that appeared to have been added after the fact. The doors were not the fancy sliding ones that most stores had but large glass ones with handles that jutted from their fronts. The concrete parking lot was old and rutted, the pavement in sad need of leveling and repainting. The people who had gathered here looked like cattle at an auction, and they all just sort of milled about aimlessly. There were some children among them, pale youths holding their parent's hands, and it was here that I saw some emotion. Most of them were jittering around like kids will do, and all of them seemed to possess a certain air of excitement.\n\n\nAs I got out of my car, notebook in hand, and went to join the collected humanity, I heard the snap of plastic from above. I looked up to see small flags had been hung on a rope running from the awning to the light poles that dotted the parking lot. They were black and white, the wind pushing them aimlessly, and it made me think of a funeral. This whole event was a funeral, I supposed, and as I got close, a banner fell to block the awning and the illusion was complete.\n\n\nIt was white with black letters, and the sentiment would seem very fitting later on.\n\n\nEVERYTHING MUST GO it proclaimed, and the sight of it gave me the willies.\n\n\nA small stage had been erected and there was a cheery man in a cheap suit standing beside an old stooped man in a much nicer suit. He had to be Jacob Thriftmire junior, but the younger man was unknown to me. He was beaming out at the crowd, looking happy to be there or anywhere on a day such as this. He glanced towards the sky as the wind snapped at the flags, and his smile seemed to wither a little. The clouds were becoming dark, and it looked like the weather might wash out the last great sale of the Discount Warehouse. \n\n\nWould everything still go in the rain?\n\n\nI supposed it would, and I was right.\n\n\nI wish I hadn’t been.\n\n\n“I’m proud to see so many of Forman’s finest out to say goodbye to a city institution that's been here since the town was little more than a logging hub.”\n\n\nLogging hub might have been a stretch, but I supposed this must be the mayor of Forman.\n\n\n“I’ve shopped here with my family for as long as I can remember, and the deals we’ve all found at the Discount Warehouse were like nothing seen anywhere else. Jacob Thriftmire has helped keep the specter of corporate greed from overtaking our town, and we will be sorry to see him go. Mr Thriftmire himself would like to say a few words, and I think we owe him that much.”\n\n\nThe applause were scattered and half-hearted and the old man approached the mic slowly before trying to lower it to his level. The banner kept catching my attention, and it just seemed off somehow. Everything must go. I had never thought about the statement before, but it was a little foreboding if you looked at it in a certain light, the kind of light that hovered around here, for example. Everything Must Go. If everything went, then what would be left? Would Forman remain? Would Gavin be safe? How much would be left behind once everything had gone?\n\n\nThe reedy voice of Jacob Thriftmire Jr. brought me back to the stage.\n\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Mayor. My Father opened up Thriftmire Allgoods a year before the great depression really sunk its claws into this county. I have strived to keep his legacy afloat, but it seems I have failed. I have failed this town, I have failed all of you, and now we must pay the price.” \n\n\nI furrowed my brow as I took a shorthand missive of the speech. This was a weird one, even for the ramblings of geriatric store owners. The people seemed as confused as he was, but the children seemed to know already. While the parents stood in polite boredom, the children were looking around with what I thought was excitement, but I quickly realized it was fear. Their neck hair was up for some reason and they all seemed on the edge of fleeing. It was like house pets just before a tornado hits. They sense the change in pressure, the change in the air, but they can do nothing but wait for it to hit and hope it doesn’t simply squash them flat.\n\n\nThat should’ve been a Warning, but I ignored it yet again.\n\n\nI was here to get a story, and I meant to be done with it before my whole day was wasted.\n\n\n“This store held the town together, in hard times and good times. Many of you have bought your furniture here for your first place, the cribs for your first babies, the groceries for your last meal, but today, it all comes to an end. Today is the final moments of Forman, so drink them in while you can.”  \n\n\nThe mayor was looking at him oddly, some of those who had come to watch looking up as if his words had broken through their daze. The children, however, stood straight as fence posts, just waiting for whatever was to come. They seemed to sense the portents, and I remember thinking that some of them might make it out, though I don't know why the thought occurred. Make it out of what? What would they need to escape?\n\n\n“I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this store has not existed on its own all these years. When my father opened his doors in nineteen thirty-two, he was full of hope for the future. He just knew that this would bring his family stability, bring them wealth, and so it did. Even through the great depression, Dad made money hand over fist, and he was very generous with the community. Forman thrived because of my Father’s money, but somewhere along the way, you all forgot that.”\n\n\nThe mayor's pasted-on smile was beginning to slip, but when he reached for the mic Jacob Thriftmire Junior gave him a stony look and he backed away.\n\n\nThriftmire was going to say his piece, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.\n\n\n“It’s true, and you all know it’s true. I kept the riff raff out, I kept the Dollar Generals and the Family Dollars and even the likes of Sam Waltons monstrosity out of this town, and how did you all repay me? You turned your noses up at the local business, at the business that had made this town great, and you drove to Gavin of Brison or,” he spat onto the hot top, “McCalister to shop at Walmart and Target and Costco as the town died around you. You put pennys over people, and now you reap what you have sown.”\n\n\nHe looked out across the crowd, looking furious with them as they looked down sheepishly.\n\n\nI was astonished.\n\n\nDid he blame them for the fall of his empire?\n\n\n“Don’t bother looking contrite. I know that you all think that those vultures will be here to nibble my corpse once my store is closed, but you are wrong. You don’t live as long as I have without picking up some tricks, and today I give you all my last deal.”\n\n\nHe wetted his lips, preparing to speak the words that must be spoken.\n\n\nHe turned to the doors and when he thrust his hands towards them, they opened to reveal the horror they had been holding at bay.\n\n\n“EVERYTHING MUST GO!”   \n\n\nAs he said it, the doors came open and a thick, black smoke came pouring out. It was almost like floating tar, the cloud impenetrable as it hovered out, and the effect was galvanizing. The sleepy crowd began to murmur and then to back away. They were unsure what to make of this, but as it got closer, they began to scream and run from the encroaching smoke bank. Some of them, however, stood mesmerized by it, some even walked towards it, and those who disappeared into it were lost within it.\n\n\nI saw most of this, however, from the inside of my car.\n\n\nThe final declaration, the negation of the town itself, had moved me as it moved the doors, and I was bringing my car to life before I realized I had moved at all. The car seemed sluggish to start, the engine making a sleepy grinding noise as it came to life, and before pulling away from the store, I looked back at the old man as he stood atop the podium. His hands were raised in exaltation, his eyes cast skyward, and as the cloud pressed against his back, I thought it might reject him for the briefest of moments.\n\n\nThen it gobbled him up along with the stunned mayor and I was leaving the lot on squealing tires.\n\n\nAs I drove out of town, I saw the smoke rising behind me. It swallowed the town in a plume of thick, gray death but I seemed to be the only car leaving town. The people I passed on the sidewalk, the ones coming out to look at the smoke, seemed to be mesmerized by the smoke. They didn’t run like the ones out front of the store had, and I was tempted to stop and shout at them. I wanted them to run, to escape the smoke, but most of them seemed to have accepted their fate. \n\n\nThe farther I drove, the more I feared that the smoke would never stop and would simply engulf everything.\n\n\nEvery mile I drove, the less I believed I would make it home.\n\n\nWhen I made it to my apartment, it hardly filled me with a sense of security.\n\n\nI’m on the couch now, my phone ringing off the hook as the office tries to get a hold of me. They want to know the same thing that the news anchors want to know; what happened to Forman? They say the town is simply missing, the smoke cloud having cleared to reveal raw earth and nothing else. The streets, the buildings, the trailer parks, the main street, everything was gone. It had been removed down to the dirt, and no one seemed to have escaped whatever had happened. They were looking for witnesses, for anyone with information, and my boss and his friends seemed to be doing the same. I guess I was the only one who’d seen what happened, and it was something that would stick with me for a long time. \n\n\nI don’t know what to do now, but I know one thing for sure.\n\n\nThe signs didn’t lie. \n\n\nEverything had to go, and so everything went."

        "selftext": "\n“Hey Sarge, can I see you for a minute?”\n\n\nI had taken half a step towards the cell when Officer Marshal stuck a meaty paw out to stop me.\n\n\n“Don’t engage him. It’s best to just ignore that one.”\n\n\nI nodded, feeling a little bad about just blowing the guy off as we got back to counting inmates.\n\n\nIt was my first day in confinement and I wanted to make a good impression on the guys I’d be spending a lot of time with in the near future. Corrections was not a job I had ever seen myself doing, but after college, I didn’t have as many prospects as I thought I would. I could go work at the diner, I could work at the hardware store, I could work as a laborer at one of the local farms, or I could pack up and move somewhere with better job prospects. I wasn’t really opposed to leaving Cashmere, it was a small town without a lot going for it, but I wasn't in a place where I could afford to leave at the moment. I started looking for jobs in other cities, and that's when I stumbled across the posting for Stragview.\n\n\nAfter looking at the pay range, I started making a plan. With the sign-on bonus and the pay grade, I could work there for the next two to three years and have enough money saved up move myself across the state, and set myself up in a job that actually interested me. What's more, the Security certification I got from the training would look good in my portfolio and maybe open up my prospects with employers. So I signed up, took the ninety-day training certification, and started my two-year tour at Stragview Penitentiary.\n\n\nAfter a few shifts of coming to work on time and not being a totally worthless human being, my captain asked me if I wanted to try my hand at confinement. He said he had a lot of brutes and manhandlers but not a lot of guys willing to have a conversation with an inmate and maybe talk them out of dumb stuff. His last one had, apparently, gone home and murdered his whole family before winding up here for execution, and he had mostly had brutes back there after that.\n\n\n“You and Marshall can good cop\/bad cop these guys a little and maybe I won’t have to fill out use of force paperwork every night on some dumb ass in G dorm.”\n\n\nI agreed and here I was in The Show as they called it.\n\n\nWe finished counting the three quads and when we got back to the station the grizzled old sergeant went for a smoke.\n\n\n“Keep an eye on two,” he mumbled, patting Marshall on the arm as he left.\n\n\nI had taken a seat in one of the ancient old chairs they kept there, Marshall sitting behind the bank of cameras that made up our new surveillance post and turned to look at me. He steepled his fingers, trying to choose his words carefully, and I immediately got a little nervous. I had been told that Marshall was a little ornery, a little hard to get along with, but he seemed fine to me. The two of us had talked about strategy games and fantasy novels, Marshall was as big a Salvator fan as I was, and when they had called count, we had gone out to the floor like we’d done it a thousand times before.\n\n\nNow he had something to impart to me, it seemed, and I hoped that I hadn’t screwed up so soon after going out.\n\n\n“I’m only gonna say it once, but I want you to listen. I’m not trying to tell you your business, I’m not trying to scare you, but I don’t want you to get hurt. The inmate in G1-01 is best avoided at all costs.”\n\n\nI nodded, but internally I breathed a sigh of relief. He was just talking about the guy I had started to talk to. The guy was probably a lifer or someone who liked to mess with new guys. I had seen a story in training about “Downing the Duck” and I figured it was in the same vein as that. Once he talked to you, you were already hooked and eventually, he’d real you in.\n\n\n“That's inmate,” I tried to remember his name but Marshall beat me to it.\n\n\n“James Tiberius Bombicus.” he spoke the name like an incantation against evil, “He has been a resident of G1 for the last year and a half, and for the last year and two months, I have tried to get him sent elsewhere. The man is a menace, a manipulator, and he will waste your time at any given opportunity. It’s best to just leave him be, don’t speak to him, and don’t acknowledge him.”\n\n\n“What about showers?” I asked, not sure how we could ignore him and still give him the things he had to have.\n\n\n“He doesn’t get them. We open his flap, and only if he moves to the back of the cell, and a towel and a bar of soap go in. He bird baths or he smells. He has only himself to smell good for anyway.”\n\n\n“Is he house alone?” I asked, still curious about this strange inmate that had Marshall so spooked.\n\n\n“He is,” he confirmed, “but that's what happens when you’re responsible for the deaths of two cellmates and an officer.”\n\n\n“He killed an officer?” I asked, startled since the man I had seen looking through the glass hadn’t looked like much, “Not here, surely, or he would be somewhere else.”\n\n\nMarshall shook his head, glancing at the cameras before looking out into the shadowy depths of quad two for a second.\n\n\n“He killed three men in that cell. One when he first got here, another five months later, and an officer five months after that. That's why I’m telling you this. I want you prepared for this man when he comes to talk to you. He is never to be by the door when you open that flap. He is always to be at the back of the cell, facing away from the door, or he gets nothing. He doesn’t eat, he doesn’t get fresh clothes, he doesn’t get anything unless he is facing away from you. Once the things he is required to have are in his cell, you close the flap and walk away. Got it?”\n\n\nHe smiled as he finished and I believed him when he said this wasn’t a joke or some kind of weird hazing. \n\n\nI told him I got it, and as the Sergeant walked back in smelling of cigarettes, we went to start showers for the evening. \n\n\nThat began my time spent around Inmate Bobicus. He was a weird guy, kind of small and quiet for the most part. His parentage was difficult to pin down, he looked mixed race but which races had mixed was anyone's guess, and Marshall just shrugged when I asked him. About once a shift he would try to get my attention, but it was only when Marshall wasn’t around. Marshall was a big guy, probably in his early to mid-forties, who had hands and arms like a longshoreman. Sometimes he would glower at Bobicus, and the inmate would smile and give him this “ain't we old pals?” look. He never spoke to him, and the inmate's food always came in a brown bag so he would drop it in and close it up before the inmate could leave the back of the cell. \n\n\nTrue to his word, Bobicus never showered, never saw medical, never received meds, and never got so much as a letter from anyone. Not because we withheld these things from him, but because no one wanted to have anything to do with him. He was utterly forgotten, a black spot in the dorm, and no one seemed to want to speak with him, inmate or staff. I felt a little bad for him in the beginning, but after night after night of dealing with him, I became less sympathetic.\n\n\nYou see, Inmate Bobicus wanted nothing so much as your attention and he wasn’t picky about how he got it.\n\n\nEvery round he would try some gambit to get you to acknowledge him.\n\n\nHe would try charms, “Hey, sarge, I bet you got somethin tasty in your lunch bag. If you don’t, you can have a soup or somethin. I’ve got a few I’ll,”\n\n\nHe tried to interest you in things you might have in common, “Hey, Sarge, did you catch the game las night? Who won? I remember the Ravens were really gettin they asses kicked in the,”\n\n\nHe would try insults, “Ya, move along, pussy. I didn’t wanna talk to you no ways. I can tell you a weak little shit by the,”\n\n\nHe would claim to need medical assistants, “Officer! Officer! I can’t breathe! I CAN’T BREATHE! I need the nurse! I need to go to the hospital! HELP ME! Someone help,”\n\n\nSometimes, he would try to move you by beginning to wail and beg for your help, “Sarge, I need to talk to someone for a minute. I’m thinking dark thoughts and I’m feeling so low. I jus need someone to talk for a,”\n\n\nBut no matter what, we would ignore him and keep doing what we were doing. He never pursued any of this, he never hurt himself, and if you called medical about his “emergencies” they would say he was fine and refuse to come down. Everyone you talked to about Inmate Bobicus seemed to have the same opinion of him, and it was a universal thing that no one liked him or would interact with him. He was an enigma, but he was a mystery I was usually too busy to worry with.\n\n\nUntil they started taking Marshall out of confinement that was.   \n\n\nIt happened at briefing about six months after I started in confinement. We were getting ready to head to our dorms when they informed Marshall that he was working as Security 9 that night. Security 9 is the frontman for the captain, the power behind the throne, and is usually the one who settles issues in the dorms so the captain doesn’t have to. They gave me and Sarge some new guy, Perkins, and I was told to train him up and get him ready for the show. \n\n\nMarshall said it would probably just be temporary, and I went to train Perkins so he would be a useful replacement.\n\n\nFour months later, Perkins had become Forey had become Vets had finally become an officer we’d received from another facility named Adams. \n\n\nAt that time, Sarge had also been replaced by a useless Sergeant name Belford.\n\n\nWe’d come in one evening to hear that Sarge, Sergeant Thomas, had been hospitalized after a bad heart attack. They weren’t sure he was going to come back, despite his insistence that he needed to return to his post, and Belford had been elected to replace him as our confinement Sergeant. Belford greeted Adams and I, shaking our hands and telling us it was a pleasure to work with us, but he turned out to be useless. Marshall had told me ahead of time, strictly off to the side, that he would be a poor replacement for Sarge, but I didn’t believe him right away. Marshall was a good guy, he’d become my best friend over the last few months, but he could be a bit of a pessimist.\n\n\n“He’s lazy, unmotivated, and he will not do paperwork or rounds. Worse, when he tries to do paperwork, he messes it up worse than if he just didn’t do it. Adams is lazy too, but at least he can be counted on to finish showers and help with chow. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, buddy, but you are basically the confinement sergeant now. You will hate it, you will likely dream of quitting, but stick it out. In the end, I think your efforts may be rewarded.”\n\n\nThat began the worst three months of my life. \n\n\nBelford was every bit as bad as Marshal had warned. Very few of the Co’s on my shift were pictures of health, but Belford made the others look good by comparison. He would not do rounds, he would not deal with inmates unless forced, and when he did he would simply give them what they wanted so he could return to his bubble. What he would do was book inmates into confinement, ruin perfectly good paperwork, and watch Youtube all night as he elevated the stock price of Hot Pockets one box at a time.\n\n\nAfter a month, I told him to stop doing folders and that I would do them when I got done with showers. He was happy to oblige and every night after that he happily sprayed crumbs across the keyboard as he consumed carbs and cat videos in equal parts. I sighed in disgust, my pants and shirt sweaty from moving grown men between shower and cell for the first four hours of my shift, and turned back to the folders that were the lifeblood of the unit. Sometimes I would manage to kick the chair Adams was sleeping in hard enough to wake him up for a round, sometimes I would just do it myself, but ultimately the work got done and I persevered.\n\n\nIt was month thirteen for me of my twenty-four-month plan, a plan I suspected I would stretch on for another year because I had given up on rejoining normal society when the mystery of Inmate Bobicus was finally solved.\n\n\nIt was a mystery that would be solved with pain and tears in the end.\n\n\nThrough all of this, inmate Bobicus had not changed at all. He continued to harass every guard who walked past him, but all of them knew better than to interact with him. I had warned all the new ones, but Adams seemed to have nothing for him from the start. He could spit and cuss and kick all he wanted, but he was ignored and he continued to fester in his cell like a mushroom in a shower stall. He still tried, though, and on the day in question, he finally got a reaction from me.\n\n\nIt had been the day from hell.\n\n\nTwo inmates had flooded their cells, making showers take way longer than they should have. Day shift hadn’t finished all the medical visits, so a nurse showed up at ten to get us to pull some inmates. The night shift that had been here the night before that, D shift, had messed up the folders by entrusting them to a new bubble officer, so I spent most of the night fixing that. I had to do incident reports for the two who had flooded since we had to use force on them to get them to stop, and when round time came at four am I still wasn’t halfway through my folders. I looked over to Adams but realized he was gone already. A glance through the windows showed me he was out on the floor with the nurse doing morning med pass, and they were still in Quad Four, where they had started.\n\n\nI looked at Belford, the big lummox pounding the desk as a cat did something stupid while a person voiced it over, and shook my head as I went to do the round.\n\n\nI started in one, and that was when it happened.\n\n\nYou see, on top of all of that, Inmate Bobicus had tried to bother me every time I went past his cell all night. He had exhausted all gambits and taken to insulting me more than anything. I was a pussy, I was a cracker, I was a homophobic slur that I won't use here, I performed sex acts with various members of my own species and other species, and on and on and on. I had ground my teeth every time I heard his voice until I was pretty sure my left bottom molar was about to crack, but I’d be lying if I said that was all it was.\n\n\nBobicus had been repeating this process every night for as long as I could remember and by now it was like a constant ice flow eroding a stone. My patients, my mental health, and my will to live were in tatters, and I was worried some days that I might hurt him more than I was worried about him hurting me. It’s hard to explain, but after a while the darkness starts creeping up on you and all the hopelessness and negativity turns you into the very thing you hate. No matter how much you fight it, eventually, it gets its claws in you, and that night it got me.\n\n\nI was coming around his cell when a small voice snapped the minor threads of my sanity like piano wire.\n\n\n“Sarge, can I talk to you for a minute?”\n\n\nWhen his voice hit me, I lost it.\n\n\n“What, Bobicus?” I shouted, turning my full attention to the cell door for the first time, “What the hell do you want?”\n\n\nIt was dark, but I could see his eyes as he peeked at me through the thin sheet of plexiglass. When he smiled, his teeth looked very white in the dark space, but I was too lost to rage to care. He had wanted my attention? Well, now he had it!\n\n\n“I just wanted to know what your plans were for after work?”\n\n\nI opened my mouth to tell him it was none of his damn business what I meant to do, but instead, I told him the truth.\n\n\nI told him the truth and as the anger drained from me in slow spurts, I felt a sense of intense malaise wash over me.\n\n\n“I’m going to sleep until it’s time to come to work again. I might stop for some food too.”\n\n\n“That's good. Man when I was on the outside, I used to love to make weird stuff with gas station food. I’d go buy Ramen noodles and canned cheese and just,”\n\n\nHe just kept talking, kept laying out this recipe for something that sounded terrible, but I couldn’t turn away. I found myself getting closer to the door, stepping right up next to the grate as I listened, and as he went on, I could smell his rancid breath through the little holes. I tried to pull against it, I didn’t want to waste my time with him, but the longer I listened, the more I was drawn in.\n\n\n“You got any coffee up there, Sarge? I bet you drink it with cream and sugar. My mom and I used to sit on the back porch and drink coffee and watch the sun come up. She was the only person who ever actually talked with me. Everyone else either ignores me or they die, but Mom always seemed to enjoy hearing me talk. I guess she died too, but not cause of nothin I did. She was just old and one day she says, “James, I won't be around forever so you better,”\n\n\nMy teeth chattered a little, my legs shaking as I stood listening to his story. What was happening to me? I felt pulled towards the grate, his words drawing me in, and the longer I listened, the weaker I felt. Someone was saying something over the radio, but anything not coming out of this man's mouth was turned down to background noise. I felt like I might be getting sleepy, like I might be getting ready to pass out, but Bobicus was only getting started. The longer he talked, the more sturdy his voice became. The more I listened, the less weak he sounded and the more he sounded like he was growing. How tall was the man? He hadn’t appeared very large, but the more he spoke, the more it seemed his voice was rising up the door.\n\n\n“When she died, I just didn’t know what to do with myself, Sarge. I was so sad, and I had to start makin my own way. I was like a child by himself, and all I knew was talkin. I started talkin to people, tellin them my story, and they just kept dyin. At first, it was weird, just watchin them shrivel up the longer they listened, but pretty soon I figured out that it was ME doin it. I was taking something from them, something I had never been able to take before. You see when I was a kid, I was real shy. I only really talked to my mom and clammed up otherwise. I remember once a teacher tried to get me to talk in front of the class but I,”\n\n\nThe words fell from his mouth like diarrhea, and the phrase had never been more apt to me. He was rambling, spewing his words like a firehose, and the longer I listened, the weaker I felt. That was how he killed people, I thought as he kept right on rambling. He talks them to death and steals their life. Pretty soon he’ll do the same to me, I thought, and I tried to break away so I could get out of his vacuum. I pushed with all my might, trying to snap out of my trance, but I was in too deep. I could hear someone yelling, hear inmates kicking and screaming, but I was powerless to do anything but sit there and listen to this fool babble.\n\n\nWhen someone hit me in a football tackle, I gasped in pain as my hip impacted the stairs.\n\n\nI broke my hip in three places, and it likely saved my life.\n\n\nMarshall had hit me around the waist and when he stood up, he started shouting at the quad for all of them to shut up. He very carefully avoided speaking to Bobicus, but I could see him give Marshall that same knowing grin that he had fixed on him before. Marshall called medical down, and I was loaded onto an ambulance and taken to Cashmere Medical Center. It’s all kind of a blur after the EMT gave me a shot of something, but when I came back to myself, I was in a crisp clean hospital room with Marshall sitting across from me in one of the oversized chairs they always have for guests.\n\n\n“Good,” he said, breathing a sigh of relief, “I was afraid I was too late.”\n\n\n“Too late?” I asked, and I almost flinched at how brittle my voice sounded.\n\n\n“Belford called to tell me that you needed assistants in G! Stat, but the stupid fool didn’t bother to give any details. The story is that you tripped going down the stairs and hurt yourself. The camera footage will likely go missing and the prison will pay for your medical bills and put you on workman's comp.”\n\n\nI nodded, wincing as my hip throbbed painfully, “Marshall, what the hell happened out there?”\n\n\n“What happened is that you engaged Inmate Bobicus in conversation and discovered why no one else will. It’s hard to understand if you’ve never seen it in action, but now you know better.”\n\n\nMarshall flexed his fingers for a moment, trying to find the words to convey what I was really asking, and finally decided to just push ahead with it.\n\n\n“About a year before you started, I made a similar mistake. I knew better, I had been told better, but Bobicus is crafty. He picks and picks and picks until you just can't take it anymore. That night, he finally got under my skin. I had an inmate in the quad kicking his door and threatening to hurt himself, and the captain we had then made Belford look like a super cop. He refused to come down and deal with it, telling us to handle it, and Bobicus happened to be his neighbor. I had answered him, honestly thinking it was the guy in the cell I’d been dealing with, and before I knew it, he had me. I stood there and listened to his nonsense, feeling my energy get sapped away as he talked. He had me for about three minutes before Sarge noticed what was happening. My fellow floor officer was at the captain's office, he was useless and was out flirting with the girl who did all of the paperwork for my useless captain, and Sarge popped emergency keys and ran out to save me. He dragged me off the floor and pulled me back to the station, but the damage was done.”\n\n\nMarshall looked at me then, really looked at me, and I saw pain behind his eyes as he asked his next question.\n\n\n“How old do you think I am?”\n\n\nI shook my head, “I don’t know. Forty? Forty-three tops?”\n\n\nHe smiled, but there was no joy behind it, “I’ll be twenty-five this year. I’m only three years younger than you. This is what Bobicus does to you. He sucks the life out of you to feed his own sick needs, but not anymore. The Warden says he’s going somewhere special, somewhere he can’t ever do this again. You can rest easy knowing you will be the last, at least I hope so.”\n\n\nHe left after that, saying he had to get some sleep before work tonight.\n\n\nI look at myself now and understand what Marshall meant. I have aged ten years in a matter of minutes, and I wonder if the change is purely to my appearance. Did he take those years from me? How did he manage to do this with only words? Did the Warden know that this was something he was capable of? It seemed as if he must have, but then why would he give him the opportunity to do it again?\n\n\nThe longer I sit here contemplating it, the more I question what other monsters might lay within Stragview and whether I want to go back there and face them a second time."

        "selftext": "I should have known the job was too good to be true.\n\nMake two hundred dollars a night to sit in an undisclosed location from sun down to sun up. No previous experience required. Non Disclosure to be signed before hiring. Candidates who break NDA will be sued for breach of contract. Must have a strong constitution and high moral fiber. Interested parties call (number below)\n\nFor a college student who was struggling to pay tuition, car insurance, and keep food in the dorm fridge, this sounded too good to be true. I looked at the party offering the service and discovered that I knew them. Doctor Crandler was a BioMed teacher who had a bit of a reputation for being out there. He was said to conduct experiments after hours in the science lab and if he hadn’t had tenure, it was pretty likely that he would have been fired. These were all rumors, of course. I’d had Doctor Crandler last year for entry level human biomes and he was a delight. He turned out to be a huge Romero fan and loved to talk about zombies and old horror movies. We had really hit it off, and when I called the number, he sounded happy to hear from me.\n\n“Oh thank god, I was hoping someone reliable would call. I’ve lost three this week, and I’m beginning to think I’ll have to stoop to drastic measures.”\n\nWhatever drastic measures were, Doc C didn’t elaborate. \n\nHe just told me to come to the science lab at five fifteen sharp.\n\n“And not a minute later!” he added before hanging up and leaving me with more questions than answers.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to expect, but two hundy was two hundy, and that would be able to put something in my body other than ramen noodles this week if the job was legit. So, about four thirty, I hopped on my bike and made my way across campus to the Verner May Science Building. It’s a huge old brick building that's been on campus since the nineteen forties. They say its been home to a lot of famous research and more than one questionable clinical trial. I had started to wonder if Doctor C was gonna try to experiment on me, and that's why he was being so secretive. I decided that if that was the case, two hundred was not enough. I had enough trouble scoring ladies with my pizza face and I doubted having four arms or two heads would help matters much.\n\nI stepped through the doors at five o'clock sharp and Doctor Crandler looked up excitedly.\n“Prompt as always! I remember that from my classes. You were always early, and I like a student who is punctual. Come this way and let me show you what I’m working on. Before we start out though,” he set a Non Disclosure Agreement in front of me and I looked over it before signing my name to it. It was pretty standard stuff. Don’t talk about what you see, don’t talk about what I’m working on, don’t tell the media, don’t post it on the internet (guess I messed that part up), yada yada yada. After that, he tossed a black hood onto the table and told me to put it on.\n\nI hesitated, not having asked him anything about what we were doing yet.\n\n“You’re, uh, not gonna experiment on me, right Doc?”\n\nHe laughed, but it didn't sound particularly merry.\n\n“No no, my boy. I would never experiment on you. I have specific parameters and I'm afraid you just don't meet them.”\n\nI wasn't sure whether to be glad or insulted, but I put the hood on either way.\nHe led me through a door, down some stairs, outside, back inside, and then down more stairs. Finally, we came to our destination, and when he took the hood off, I was in a little room about the size of your average dorm room. Inside was a table, a chair, and a glass jar with something floating inside. It was roughly the size of a spud, though if it was a potato it was one of those big ole Idaho job. I'd say it was about two feet tall, maybe half a foot wide, and it just sort of floated there placidly.\n\n“This is your job.” Doctor C said, pointing to the jar.\n\n“What? Just watch this thing? Easy peasy!” I said, not yet understanding what I was agreeing to.\n\n“Just watch it till I get here to relieve you. Be careful, it's very tricky. It may try to get you to let it go. Do Not let it go under ANY circumstances. For that, I'll pay you two hundred dollars a night.”\n\nI put out a hand, being a man who signs deals with a shake, and Doctor C pumped my arm one good time before saying he was going to leave now.\n\n“I'm going to lock you in. If you have to urinate, there's a bucket in the corner. There are snacks and water in the mini fridge over there, though I would prefer it if you don't take your eyes off that jar.\n\nI started to protest about having to wizz in a bucket, but I just nodded and told him not to worry about it. A deal was a deal, as my old man liked to say, and when he left, I heard the door lock behind him. So, I settled in and took out my phone as I surfed Reddit. I kept an eye on the jar, looking up about every thirty seconds, but mostly I just sat there and tried not to fall asleep. That was the hardest part. It was so boring, just sitting there for ten to twelve hours, and I made a mental sticky to bring coffee tomorrow. Doc had some snacks in his fridge, but Kale chips and pita chips with hummus are not what a man desires when he's trying not to zonk out.\n\nThe weird little thing in the jar didn't help much either. It was boring. All it did was float there, but I guess thats not quite true. Sometimes I would look up and find it looking at me, its weird brown body seeming to watch me. It couldn't really be doing that, since it didn't have eyes, but I still felt very seen as I sat there on my phone. I made a note to bring a charger too, but luckily it lasted till the doc came back, and he smiled as he handed me my two hundred dollars in cash at the end of the shift.\n\n“Do you feel anything? Any headaches or nausea?” he asked.\n\nI told him I didn't and he invited me to come back tomorrow night.\n\nI told him for sure, and left two hundred bones the richer.\n\nI kept watching the little science project for the next week and ended with an extra fourteen hundred bucks in my pocket. I agreed to do it seven nights a week, and as spring began, the nights got a little shorter too. Soon the sun was going down closer to eight, and I didn't have to show up till seven thirty or eight o'clock. Getting a couple of hundred bucks for ten hours of work was boss, and I got a lot of Raid Shadow Legends played and Reddit scoped while I sat there and collected mulla for sitting on ass.\n\nWhen I arrived Tuesday of the next week, however, something had changed in my little potato cash cow.\n\nThe thing had an ear.\n\nDoc sat me down and as the hood came off, he asked if I noticed anything different about the little blob. I looked at it critically, but couldn't really see anything different. Doc didn't really like this answer, and told me to look harder. After a few minutes of coming up with nothing, he sighed in exasperation and pointed.\n\n“It has acquired an auditory openings for vocal registration.”\n\nThe look I gave him must have told him all he needed, because he just shook his head and tapped the tank.\n\n“It has an ear hole.” he said, and I finally got it.\n\nAfter some looking, I realized what he was talking about and he seemed pretty proud of himself.\n\n“We've been working with chemical stimuli and had a breakthrough when it finally developed some form of communication peripheral.”\n\n“How do you know it can hear you?”\n\nIt was his turn to look puzzled, until I pointed out that it didn't have any way to let them know if it could hear them.\n\n“Well, it kind of wiggles around when we talk to it or play music. It hadn't done that much before, so we think it must be able to hear us.”\n\nHe left after that, and I made sure to turn the volume up on my videos so the little dude, or dudette, could listen too. It definitely bounced around a little, dancing in the water a bit as it moved around in its glass tank. I thought it was a little funny, and turned the volume way up as it wiggled and wobbled.\n\nBy the end of the week, it had two ear holes and some little baby ears to go with them.\nThe Doc told me to take a week off after that, saying they had some experiments to run on the little thing, and I told him to call me back when he needed me. I took some time and spent a little of my money paying bills and settling debts. By the end of the week, I was praying for a call from Doc C, and Sunday night, he obliged.\n\n“I could use a set of eyes next week, if you're free.”\n\nI told him I'd be there, and pumped my fist in excitement.\nWhen he took the hood off monday, he was rewarded by a “whoa” of interest from yours truly.\nThe little sucker had a toothless mouth that it seemed to be opening and closing like a fish out of water.\n\n“I came in Sunday to find that it had grown it. It's pretty interesting stuff,” Doctor C told me, “Has it spoken to you before tonight? Some of my assistants claim it has spoken to them by way of telekinesis, but you don't seem to have suffered from any of the symptoms they've talked about.”\n\n“Thankfully not, Doc. All the little guy does is float and make me money.”\n\nDoc C nodded, looking thoughtful before leaving and locking me in for the night.\n\nI had just brought my phone out to start scrolling Reddit for the night, when I heard a muffled voice from somewhere. I looked up, thinking someone was outside the door, but the door was solid wood. I looked at my phone to make sure I wasn't accidentally butt dialing someone, but thats when I heard the slight tap from in front of me. I looked up to see the little potato thing as it bumped the glass with its body, its toothless mouth forming words from behind its prison.\n\n“Hello? Are you there?” it asked, its words muffled by the water and the glass.\n\nI looked at it, not sure if it could even hear me when I responded, but when it floated back a little, I guessed it probably could.\n\n“Hello, you sound different than the good doctor or his friends. Are you someone new?”\n\n“Not really,” I said, half laughing, “I've actually been here watching you for a couple weeks.”\n\n“Oh,” it said, very interested, “You must be the one I couldn't reach. I'm glad we can finally speak properly.”\n\nI sat my phone down, leaning in a little closer as I watched the little brown thing float in the off color water that held it.\n\n“What do you mean? You only just got a mouth.”\n\n“Yes, well, there are more ways than one to communicate, aren't there? I've been trying to touch your mind for weeks, but you don't seem overly receptive to my advances. Thus, I had to find alternative means of communication if we were to speak.”\n\nIts voice, despite being muffled by the glass, was very smart sounding. Little dude was the smartest floating potato I had ever met, though the list was just him for the moment. He sounded like the doc a little. He used a lot of big words, and sounded like he knew a lot of stuff. I put my face a little closer to the glass as I looked at him, watching him float there, and wondering what he might know?\n\nWe talked a lot that night. Well, I talked a lot. The little just kind of floated and listed, throwing something out every now and again. He wanted to know where he was, how he had come to be in a fishbowl, and what the Doc intended to do with him? I didn't know most of these things, and I told him that. He didn't seem too thrilled with that answer, but he still kept talking to me. He asked about me and what I was studying and what sort of things I liked to do. I didn't pick up my phone much that night. Instead, I told the little guy about myself and we talked for hours about nothing in particular.\n\nThe clock said it was about four am when the subject finally turned to what he really wanted.\n\nI wish now that we had just kept talking about me.\n\n“So, despite the fact that you cant leave this place, you could still take me out of this tank, right?”\n\nI snorted, “Why would you want to? It's really not much better out here than in there.”\n\n“True, but I would very much like to experience life outside my bowl. I lack hands or I would do it myself, but you could help me out.”\n\n“Sorry, little dude,” I said, and I found that I was kinda sorry, “you're a good hang, but I promised the Doc that I wouldn't take you out. I think it was one of those papers I had to sign to get this job.”\n\n“No one has to know,” it said, its voice kind of sneaky as it pressed its brown side against the glass, “you could take me out for just a second and then put me right back in.”\n\n“No,” I said, looking at the door like I'd been doing something wrong, “I...I really shouldn't.”\n\n“Please,” it begged, “You have no idea what its like to live in your own filth. Now that I have a mouth, I can constantly taste the stagnant water I live in. It's pure hell.”\n\n“Dude, stop it. That's not cool. You know I can't take you out, I told Doc I,” but then it did the last thing I would have expected.\n\nIt started to cry.\n\nI don't mean it was pretending to cry, the thing started loosing these tortured sounds that made me think of someone going through a bad break up. It sounded super hopeless, and it began to bump it's body against the side of the tank. I picked up my phone and tried to ignore it, but its hard listening to something just cry and cry like that. I had a room mate once who just kinda gave up after his girlfriend dumped him and he just lay on his bed and cried until his parents finally came to get him. I never saw ole dude again, but I can still hear his sobs sometimes when I close my eyes.\n\nIt was heartbreaking, and infuriating, and I wanted to console him as much as I wanted him to shut the hell up.\n\n“Please! Please just let me out! I can't stand this anymore! I need to get out! I need to get out! I NEED TO GET OUT!”\n\nIt yelled and screamed and begged and cried for another hour and a half, and when the key turned in the lock, I was never happier to see the Doc.\n\nDoc C looked at the little creature in the jar and asked me what had happened?\n\n“Nothin,” I said, “It started talking after you left and then when I wouldn't let it out, it started screaming and crying.”\n\nFar from being angry or disturbed, Doc C seemed amazed. He started studying the thing through the glass, before I reminded him that I was done for the night and needed to leave. He pulled himself away begrudgingly before handing me my money and putting the sack back over my head. I found an extra hundred in the pile that night, for my suffering I supposed, and thought about not coming back that night. The blubbering and crying had been a lot to handle, but I couldn't deny that the money was good and it was helping me pay down a lot of my outstanding debts. Another month of this, and my rent would be paid for the next year. Another two months and my credit card would be paid and I could afford that new flat screen for the living room. The things wailing had been a lot to handle, but what was a little more next to financial freedom?\n\nI made sure to pick up some earplugs before I came back the following night and that's how I spent my next week.\n\nIn that week, the little creature grew an eye and four small fingers, two on each side of its body.\n\nThe night I arrived to find it had an eye, it told me all night how I looked like a kind person, and how it didn't understand how I could just sit here and watch it suffer. The earplugs helped a little, but it seemed like I could still hear it through the plugs. It would start out trying to talk to me, trying to flatter me, trying to reason with me, but we would always end up with it crying and me trying to ignore it. It became harder and harder as time went on, and every night seemed to be a battle to not open the tank and let it out or to just flip the table and smash its tank into a thousand pieces.\nIn the end, it always came down to the money and I always managed to stop myself from doing something stupid.\n\nIt was a Tuesday when something I hadn't considered happened.\n\nTuesday night started out just like any other. Doc C brought me into the room, took off the hood, and there sat the little creature in its glass prison. It smiled at me, and I could see a couple of teeth breaking the gums. It had six fingers now and they made it look a little like a bug as they wiggled energetically. It still had only the one eye, but the beginnings of a nose had started to form under it. It was a repugnant little thing, and as the Doc left and I settled in, I kept my mind on the money, reminding myself that I just had to power through tonight.\n\nIt would be over in ten hours and I could go back to my room and sleep.\n\nIt spent the next ten hours talking, pleading, crying, and trying everything it could to gain its freedom. Well, that's not quite true. It never tried to threaten me. It probably realized that such a thing would have been pointless. It could no more have hurt me than my two year old nephew could and had decided on a different gambit. When it started its piercing wailing again, I popped the ear plugs in and shut most of it out. The plugs tuned the thing down to about a two, and made it easier to ignore. I was just thinking that I might treat myself to some really nice noise canceling headphones and forgo the tv for another week, when I saw someone familiar in a piece of Reddit News.\n\nI almost dropped the phone as I read over the article, not sure what to make of it.\n\n“Doctor Joseph Crandler arrested after trying to buy biological materials from an undercover agent.”\n\nThe picture showed Doc C looking very unhappy as he was led away in cuffs. He was wearing the same clothes I had seen him leave in the night before, and the article that followed didn't cheer me up. He had been buying materials from his experiments from some disreputable people, and finally he had put his trust in the wrong one, or maybe the right one, I guess. The agent had arrested him and they were holding him for questioning.\nI felt a cold chill as I looked over at the little freak in the tank. Was this the sort of experiment he'd been buying materials for? I had never thought to question if this thing was something the college had sanctioned or not, and now I realized that I might be part of an illegal experiment. They'd be coming for me next, me and this thing, and they'd assume I was the Egor to his Doctor Frankfurter or whatever.\n\nAs the creature wailed and thrashed, my brain started putting blocks together that it should have a few minutes ago.\n\nMy biggest problem wasn't that they would think I was involved, it was that if they didn't come and the Doc didn't come, then I would have no way out of here.\n\nI was trapped with this little crying dude for god knew how long.\n\nI thought about calling for help, but that could be bad too. What if they thought I was part of this? I'd have a hard time convincing them that I had nothing to do with this when they found me with the evidence. What's more, all the Doc had to say was that I was his assistant, that he had paid me, and I'd be in the same prison chow line as him.\nI started looking around the room for escape routes, but there was nothing but the very locked door. The little creature kept asking what was happening, but I just kept ignoring him. There were no windows, no other doors, not even a vent to squeeze into, like in the movies. All the while, the creature wailed and pleaded to be released. It knew something was wrong, and it wanted to be set free. It could help me, it could get me out of here, it could do anything as long as I would take it out of the tank.\n\nAfter searching the little room again and again, I finally just sat and tried not to go crazy.\n\nMy phone will make calls, but I have no idea how to tell anyone to find me or even if they could. I tried to explain to the police what was happening, I even mentioned Doctor C, but I think the dispatcher thought I was high. They started hanging up on me when I called back, and if they trace my number, all their going to find is my dorm room, which is empty. Luckily, I have a charger on me, so I can keep calling out and trying to get someone to help me.\n\nI checked the fridge, and there's enough bottled water and snacks in there to last for three or four days. Less if I feed this little bastard, but I'm not even sure what he eats. I've never been given any feeding instructions for him, and I'm not going to waste my food on this squalling thing. I threw a tarp over him, but it isn't doing anything to dull the screaming. It sounds like he might have grown more mouths because I can hear his shrill little voice from every angle as it bounces off the wall.\n\nOne things for sure, if it doesn't stop screaming soon, I'm going to give him some kind of release.\n\nIf it goes on much longer, I'm going to wrench the lid off that tank and stomp the life out of him. \n\nIf someone doesn’t come soon, I’m going to release him from his suffering forever."

        "selftext": " \n\nIt was a dark and stormy night, and I was driving home from a long day at work. The rain was coming down in sheets, making it nearly impossible to see the road in front of me. As I navigated through the darkness, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nI tried to turn up the radio to drown out my uneasy thoughts, but static was all that filled the airwaves. I was starting to feel like I was the only person left in the world.\n\nSuddenly, a figure appeared out of nowhere, standing in the middle of the road. I swerved to avoid hitting them, but as I passed, I caught a glimpse of their face in the rearview mirror. It was twisted and grotesque, with glowing eyes that seemed to pierce through the darkness.\n\nI hit the accelerator, trying to put as much distance between me and that terrifying figure as possible. But no matter how fast I drove, I could feel them getting closer and closer.\n\nAs I drove, the roads became increasingly deserted and unfamiliar. I realized that I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere along the way, and now I was lost in a strange and unfamiliar place. The rain was coming down even harder now, and I could barely see a few feet in front of my car.\n\nI was starting to panic, but I knew I had to keep it together if I wanted to survive. I fumbled for my phone, trying to call for help, but there was no signal. I was completely alone, with no way to call for help.\n\nJust as I thought I was going to make it home safely, my car came to a sudden stop. The engine had died, and I was stuck on the side of the road, completely vulnerable.\n\nI could hear the sound of footsteps approaching my car, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before whatever horrors lay in wait for me caught up. I closed my eyes and prayed for a miracle, but it never came.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder. I jumped, turning to see who it was, but there was no one there. I was completely alone in the car.\n\nI tried to start the car again, but it was no use. The engine was dead, and there was nothing I could do. I was trapped, with no way out.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I could feel a presence growing stronger and stronger inside the car. I couldn't see it, but I could feel it all around me, watching my every move.\n\nI tried to stay as still as possible, hoping that whatever it was would lose interest and go away. But it only seemed to be getting closer.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, I heard a voice. It was soft and whispery, and I couldn't make out the words. But I knew that it was the voice of the thing that was stalking me.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. I threw open the car door and ran into the darkness, not caring where I was going as long as I was away from that thing.\n\nI ran until my legs gave out, and then I collapsed to the ground, panting and sobbing. When I looked up, I saw that I was in the middle of a dense forest, with no sign of civilization in sight.\n\nI was lost and alone, with no way to call for help. And I knew that I was not alone in the woods. The thing that had been stalking me was still out there, watching and waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nI don't know how long I stayed there, trembling and huddled on the ground. It could have been hours, or it could have been days. Time seemed to have no meaning in that place.\n\nAs the darkness closed in around me, I knew that I had to do something to try and save myself. I couldn't just sit there and wait for the end.\n\nI forced myself to my feet and began to walk, not knowing where I was going or what I would find. I just had to keep moving, to stay ahead of the thing that was hunting me.\n\nI walked for what felt like an eternity, until my feet were raw and blistered and my body was wracked with exhaustion. Just when I thought I couldn't go on any longer, I saw a faint light in the distance.\n\nHope surged through me, and I redoubled my efforts, stumbling towards the light with all the strength I had left. As I got closer, I realized that it was a small cabin nestled in the woods.\n\nI fell to my knees in front of the door, sobbing with relief. I knew that I had found sanctuary, at least for the moment.\n\nI banged on the door, desperate for someone to let me in. To my surprise, it swung open, revealing an old woman with a kind face.\n\n\"Please, help me,\" I begged, collapsing at her feet.\n\nShe took me in, wrapping me in blankets and tending to my wounds. And as she told me her story, I realized that she had been lost in these woods for years, ever since the thing that was stalking me had taken her husband.\n\nWe stayed in that cabin for what felt like a lifetime, waiting for the thing to come for us. And when it finally did, we were ready. Together, we fought back with all the strength we had, driving it away into the darkness from whence it came.\n\nI never saw the thing again, but I know it's still out there, waiting for its next victim. And as I sit here, safe and sound, I can't help but wonder who will be next to face its horrors."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nDecember is a time of cheer and goodwill for most of the world. People exchange gifts, sing songs, houses are decorated, big meals are eaten with friends and family. Molly didn't learn about any of this until after she left the village. She'd spent her first year away from home getting odd sidelong stares and hearing repressed mumbles as she asked about their preparations and inquired about their sacrifices. No one seemed to know about Him, which filled Molly with hope. \n\nNo one knew what it was like to live in the shadow of His fear, which made Molly hope she had escaped him.\n\nTen years later, Molly had a home of her own with a husband to keep her warm on cold nights and children to fill her heart with joy. She'd worked hard to leave behind all traces of her old life, moved to America, and found a place where she could forget the darker things that still lurked in the old world. Molly's home was now covered in lights every December, snowmen standing sentry on the lawn, and her home was filled with the smells of cakes and cookies and the laughing of happy children. \n\nIt was Christmas Eve again, and Molly was hard at work in the kitchen. Jake was ten, Hannah six, and Molly had been baking and cooking all day in preparation for tomorrow's dinner. Joseph's family would be coming over to exchange presents, and she wanted this meal to be the best yet. The children were preparing for bed, brushing teeth and washing faces, and as the last of her preparation went into the stove, Molly sat down and sighed happily. Everything was done, everything was ready, and now it was time to relax before Joseph came home and\n\n\"Mama! We're ready for our story!\"\n\nMolly sighed, but it was a happy sigh. She had forgotten about storytime. She scratched the bandage on the back of her hand as she made her way to the back of the house. The blood stains on it stood out a little, and when Joseph asked her about it, Molly had told him she'd burned her hand on the stove. Maybe, she thought, she should tell him what actually happened. The more Molly thought about it, the more she knew that she wouldn't know where to begin.  \n\nThe children were nestled all snug in their beds when Molly arrived, and as she took her seat in the big wooden rocker in the middle of the room, asking them what story they wanted tonight.\n\n\"Three bears?\"\n\n\"No, mama, that's a baby story!\" Hannah exclaimed with deep indignation.\n\n\"Mickey Mouse Christmas, maybe?\"\n\n\"Pfff, that book is lame.\" Jake said, making full use of his new \"big kid attitude\" he seemed to have acquired when he turned ten.\n\n\"Well, what do you want to hear?\" Molly asked, rubbing the bridge of her nose as she felt a headache developing.\n\n\"We want to hear a scary story!\" said Jake\n\n\"I want to hear a Christmas story.\" said Hannah, adding timidly, \"That's maybe a little scary.\"\n\nMolly tried to squash her frustration. She was just thinking that she didn't know any scary Christmas stories but realized that wasn't true. Molly knew an absolutely terrifying Christmas story. A story made all the scarier because it was true. A story made all the more frightening because Molly had lived it.\n\n\"You want a scary story, do you?\" She asked, and both leaned forward from beneath their covers. \"I have a scary Christmas story if you'd like to hear it,\" \n\nMolly asked the question coyly, knowing they would want to hear. Her children were not the children Molly had grown up with. They were not children of the cold and the snow. They wanted to be scared but had no clue what genuine fear was. They didn't know what it meant to shiver in the corner as you hear the Green One tromp down your street. They had never felt the terrible cold that signaled the end of someone you loved.\n\nMolly prayed they never did, but maybe a taste wouldn't hurt them too badly.\n\nMolly almost felt the cold creeping up her legs as she began, returning to a time when she had known the fear she hoped to instill. \n\n*Mama is not from here. Unlike daddy, mama was not born in this great country. Once, she lived in a town called Ingsfield. Ingsfield was a small farming town, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We had no cars, no phones, no televisions, and our light came from candles and the fire you cooked your meals over. Our town was a simple one, our ways simple too, and that was how we liked it.* \n\n*When autumn began, we began preparing for His arrival for winter.*\n\n\"Whose arrival, mama?\" Hannah asked, her voice a little excited.\n\n\"His arrival,\" Molly intoned, \"the coming of the Winter Lord.\"\n\n\"Whose…\"\n\n\"Hush, Child, and listen.\" Hannah fell silent again, and Molly continued.\n\n*The Harvest was always a time of celebration. The whole town worked together to bring in the bounty of the farmland. The livestock were brought in from the field, and knives were sharpened in preparation for the slaughter. The meat was salted and packed for storage, food was stored and canned and placed in cellars for the long winter ahead, and then, when everyone was set aside for winter, we put our excess together and prepared the end of Autumn feast.* \n\n*On the last week of what you would call November, we held an Autumn fair. It was always held on the village green, a long few acres near the town hall, and was always highly anticipated. There was music at the bandstand, dancing on the pavilion, tables laid with food and drink, games for the children, and prizes to be won. The celebration went on for a week. Some people celebrated all seven days and only slept when their bodies demanded it. The people seemed to dance and play all the joy and warmth out of themselves during that week. Many knew that the next four months would be hard, knew that they might not see another autumn festival. So they lived a whole year in one week, and the whole town seemed to shrink when it was over.*\n\n*On December first, we began to feel the first real chill of winter.*\n\n*That was when we began to build the altar.*\n\nThey were both wide-eyed now, their questions squashed for the moment. She drew them in with her story, painted a picture of the idyllic life she'd once known, and now came time for the real story to begin. It was time to show them a place where Santa Clause did not stop. A land where Christmas trees brought no joy. These symbols would not save them from the Winter Lord, and it was time they knew of what waits in the cold and the gloom.\n\n*The town of happy revelers changed overnight. Now happy faces red with drink became somber and knowing. They went to the quarry and brought the altar stone, the stones they'd used for many and many a, still red with the dried leavings of last year's unfortunate chosen. They spent the week stacking stones and adjusting them just right so that their shape might please Him when he came. After a week of stacking and preparing the altar, the offering was chosen, and the contents were inspected. The Lord's Offering, the last crop planted that year, was harvested, and the vegetables and grains were inspected for flaws that might anger Him. Once this was done, two calves were chosen and brought forth to be inspected for defects or weaknesses. These were usually the two calves who'd taken home the Best in Show at the Autumn Fair, and their owners always looked sad, knowing that these two would never grow to adulthood and would never know the fear of the sharpened knives next year.*\n\n*Only then, only after these things were chosen, did the town choose the real sacrifice.*\n\nThey were shivering now, and why not? Could Molly not feel the coldness in the room? That frigidity couldn't be dispelled by fire or blanket. Its coldness was as old as time and as bleak as the tundra. It had been felt by the first man who shivered in his cave on a winter's night. It was the coldness that man felt when The Winter Lord came to his cave and offered him a better way, a darker way.\n\nCold as they were, Molly had their attention. Both were huddled beneath their blankets, shuddering from either cold and fear, but they could not look away. She saw that Hannah wanted her to stop before the story got really scary. Molly could also tell that Jake wished he had never asked for a scary story at all. There was magic in this tale that neither had ever known, making it all the more tantalizing.\n\nThey would know of Him even if the knowledge drove them mad in its knowing.\n\n*The townspeople never chose their sacrifice.* \n\n*They would not have had the nerve to cut their own flock.*\n\n*The mark always chose for them.*\n\n*The mark would appear on the door of the sacrifice, a circle of blood with three slashes through it, and the sacrifice would feel it burned into the skin of their hand one night as they slept. Its appearance was unquestioned by any and all though some sacrifices did try to claim falseness. I remember the mark being contested only once, and the man's protests made little difference. He owned the biggest farm and the most land within the village. He claimed that his sons had made the mark so the father would be put out of his way and inherit his lands. His son claimed no part in this, but it mattered not. The farmer had been chosen in the traditional way, and thus, he was locked away until the night of sacrifice. He screamed when that night came, but his screams didn't last long.*\n\n*Some went quiet, some went screaming, but they always went the same way.* \n\n*They went with the cold.*\n\n*At sunset, the snow began to blow in. Sometimes the snow would come before Him, but the snow that preceded Him was always thick and unforgiving; snow from the mountain tops that killed if you stayed in it too long. The snow blew, and the wind howled, and as the darkness settled over the town, we heard him approach. He came a horse, the steel-shod hooves cutting through the ice as it solidified on the dirt streets of our small village. I remember peeking one year when I was tiny, and before my mother saw me and pulled me beneath the sill, I saw Him mounted on his horse. His skeletal horse was thin as a rail, its legs like sticks with frost for skin, and its eyes shone red with the fires of hell as its mane of shadows rippled like thistle from its scaly head.* \n\n*As terrible as he was, he was beautiful when put against his rider.*\n\n*His rider, The Winter Lord, The Green Man, He Who Accepts the Flesh.*\n\n*Though he was man-shaped, that was where the resemblance ended. He came dressed in armor of the deepest forest green, a cape of blue trailing behind him. His cape was ragged, covered in old red stains and stiff with frost, and as it trailed out, we could hear the ice on it breaking as it snapped in the wind. He held a two-handed ax in one clawed hand, and whether those claws were armor or his own hand's, no one knew. The ax was monstrous, its edge ever dripping the blood of his victims. He held it down at his side, so it dragged the snow and left a red trail behind him. On his head sat a helmet topped with a magnificent rack of antlers, and charms and sigils of unknowable meaning hung from those horns. No one had ever seen his face and lived. He kept it hidden beneath the helmet, but his eyes were as red as his horses. If they fell upon you and met your own, he would raze your hovel to the ground and seek out their bloodline until it was expunged from the earth.* \n\n*He came to town on the twenty-fourth of December, a day which had some significance for him. With him came a mighty blizzard. It would cover the town and hide his deeds from sight as he went about his business. There were some who held the idea that he took pity upon the sacrifice and took them back to his realm to be his guest. There were those who believed that those he took would stay in the court of Queen Mab, Fairy Queen of Winter, who must be the ruler of the Winter Lord and thus his master. Those with hovels close to the altar, those like my family, had no such illusions. Sometimes you could hear them screaming and begging over the wind and hail, and sometimes you could only hear the metallic slap of the ax as he went about his butcher's work.*\n\n*When the storm ended, all that was left was the fresh blood upon the altar.*\n\n*All else was taken, never to be seen again.*\n\n\"No way!\" Jake whispered, but he didn't sound very sure.\n\n\"You doubt your mother's words?\" Molly asked, feeling the old way of speaking coming back to her.\n\n\"There's no way this kind of thing could happen. Someone would hear about it and put a stop to it. Plus, why didn't they leave? This Winter Guy probably wouldn't follow them, right?\"\n\nShe smirked at him, \"The people knew what the sacrifice bought them, Jake. If they appeased the Winter Lord, then the winter only lasted four months and was mellow in the month before Spring. With Spring would come the bounty of the crops, and on the years when the sacrifice was good, the crops were the best they had ever seen. \"He only took one person. A fair trade for a year of peace and a bountiful harvest,\" they would say. I, too, said it. I said it for sixteen years until my own time came.\"\n\n\"Your...your time?\" Jake asked, but he knew what his mother meant.\n\n\"Until the mark appeared on my door.\" she said, \"until the brand appeared on my hand.\"\n\n*My mother cried, and my brothers offered to hide me, but my father was staunch in his resolve.*\n\n*\"The mark cannot be argued with. She will go to the council hall to wait for His coming.\"*\n\n*I spent that week in the mayor's house, awaiting my fate. A dress of snowy white was made for me, a garland of green steel forged for my head. Upon my feet were slippers of the softest doeskin, and I just knew they would pinch when I put them on. Many believed that if the sacrifice was female, and the Winter Lord found her beautiful, he might take her to his castle in the mountains and make her his Queen of Winter, where she might live out her days as his consort and wife. The blood on the altar screamed of their stupidity, but the lies we tell ourselves are often the coziest.*\n\n*I did not need to be dragged to the stone when the time came. I walked up the street, mud squelching against my shoes, as the townspeople watched me with a mixture of sorrow and resolve. \"We are sorry for your sacrifice, but it must be. Death for you and life for the crops,\" that look said. Had I not looked at the sacrifice just that way? Had I not known that the mark might appear on my own hand one day? I had been selfish all these years, I had taken of the towns well, and now it was time for me to give. I mounted the altar as the sun began to sink, but despite all my assuredness, I didn't feel selfish.*\n\n*\"Why should I give up my life?\" I asked myself. Because it was a tradition? Because it was expected? Because it had always been? I began to see what I had never seen in the years of living in this town. Why did we give him what he wanted? Why did we let him take? Why didn't we just say no?*\n\n*As young as I was, I shouldn't have been so naive.*\n\n*When the sunset, the show began. The snow blew up out of nowhere, and the wind only pushed it in my face. I could hear the clomp of His horse as He came on, and as I squinted into the blowing wind, I could make out His antlered helm as He approached the altar. His ax made a sharp sound on the cobbles as He neared, and when He stopped before me, I could see Him staring at me from under the visor of His helmet. He hadn't yet raised the ax, and from my vantage point, He seemed to be waiting for something.*\n\n*He was staring at me, His red eyes holding disbelief, and I saw my opportunity at that moment.* \n\n*I jumped from the altar, snow, and ice battering me on all sides, and ran towards the woods.*\n\n*He screamed into the gathering night, and His voice sounded like the howl of an angry east wind.* \n\n*He came after me, hooves thundering steps behind me, but as I entered the woods, I was ready for Him. I'd played in these woods all my life, and I knew it would be impossible for a horse, even a horse as thin as His, to move quickly among the tightly packed trees. The forest flowed around me in a long brown blur, and I heard him roar as he realized he couldn't ride me down. I heard his ax slap futilely into a tree as I ran, but I didn't stop to see what he was doing. I ran and ran until I found a burrow in the bottom of an ancient tree. I sank into it, ignoring the roots and spider webs that nestled there, and spent that night shivering against the bitter cold.* \n\n*As I shivered, I heard something I had not expected to hear.*\n\n*I heard the screams of the town as He laid it to waste. Other people ran into the woods but took no notice of my hiding place. They ran like frightened rabbits, certain He would be behind them, but I knew better. They would die of the cold, likely I would too, but as I pulled at the crunchy leaves that the hollow had swallowed up, I felt surer and surer that I would survive. I bided there till morning, the screams dying out in the wee hours, and when I awoke, I was homeless and an orphan.*\n\n*I returned to town long enough to get my things and leave. The houses were destroyed, hollow husks that would sit silently forever. The few people who still abided there looked at me with sullen eyes full of hate. They wanted to hurt me, wanted to kill me, but these sheep had stood by as their friends and family were taken by that winter knight. I knew they would not raise their hands against me, and when I left, I left for good.*\n\n\"What did you do then, mama?\" asked Hannah, her lip trembling as my story finally ended.\n\n\"I met your father six months later. He was backpacking through Europe and took me for another backpacker. I'd been homeless for those last six months, scrounging food and looking over my shoulder for Him. When he offered to let me come with him, I accepted. By the time we reached London, we were in love, and when he brought me home to meet your grandparents, we were already planning marriage. That's how I came to be in America, children. That's how I came to escape the place of my birth.\"\n\nShe let them sleep then, kissing their foreheads and turning off the lights. Molly could hear them rolling in their beds, their dreams filled with ice. A fitful sleep was better than nothing, though. Molly sighed as she came into the living room. She hadn't told them everything, of course. How could you tell your children everything? Sometimes the truth only brings fear. Molly took off the bandage and looked at the burn on the back of her hand. The circle with three slashes through it was as plain as it had been on the night she was to be sacrificed. Its meaning was as clear now as it had been then, too.\n\nHe was coming for his lost sacrifice.\n\nShe went to the window and looked out into the backyard. Molly could see Him there, mounted on his ice horse and staring at her balefully with those piercing red orbs. He stood between the children's swing set and the wooden play fort they'd gotten last Christmas, looking as out of place as an altar stone at an autumn festival. Ten years was a long reprieve, she reflected, and as Molly stood holding his gaze, she knew what must be done. Joseph wouldn't understand, and the kids would be devastated, but maybe her sacrifice would stop them from being involved. As Molly opened the sliding door on the back porch, she felt the winter blizzard kiss her face as it had on that night ten years ago.\n\nHe walked His horse towards her, and as the ax came up, Molly knew there would be no throne of winter for her. \n\nShe spread her arms and welcomed Him to His sacrifice.\n\nMolly welcomed Winter as her people had for generations.\n\nWith Blood and Resolve"

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThe door banged closed and roused Father Maxy from his doze.\n\nHe had been napping in the confessional booth and had honestly expected not to be disturbed until morning.\n\n\"Bless me, father, for I have sinned.\"\n\nHe glanced at his watch and saw it was midnight on Christmas Day. He tried to hide the sigh that escaped him and managed to hide it nicely behind a yawn. Whoever's idea it had been to hold a Christmas Eve confessional was beyond him, but so far, it had netted very few sinners past ten o'clock. Father Maxi had, so far, spoken to two drunks, Parishioner Matthew, who believed that folding his sister's underwear was a sin, and a pervert who wanted to breathe heavily until he left a sinful mess in the box.\n\nHe had hoped the pervert would be the last, but this man had come in and ruined his celebration.\n\n\"Father? Are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son,\" he said as he straightened himself, \"speak your sin, and I will listen.\"\n\n\"This night, I did break into a house without consent.\" \n\nFather Maxi nodded. He was often privy to crimes, both the black and the less serious. He'd heard more than one \"good catholic\" who'd admitted to coveting his neighbor's flat screen this week. He usually kept such sins to himself, but last year when that crying man had admitted to raping all those children, he had been forced to go talk to Detective O'Shawnesy, another Good Catholic. Sins were one thing, but Father Maxi was not the sort of priest to let child molestation continue, as the Diocese could have attested. \n\nThis fellow, though, would likely be sent on with a few hail Marys and a Merry Christmas.\n\n\"Very well, my son, twelve hail,\"\n\n\"I'm not finished, Father. I can't go to the police with this story, and I know that you've always been a good boy who will know what to do with the information.\"\n\nGood Boy?\n\nThat phrase took him back a little.\n\nFather Maxi, a priest well into his forties, hadn't been a \"boy\" in many years.\n\n\"Continue, my son. I will listen.\"\n\n\"When I came in, I went to the tree and began my work. I was half done, there were so many presents, you understand, when I heard a noise upstairs. I ignored it at first. With three children in the home, someone was likely to be a light sleeper, but as I worked, the noise became louder. I finally recognized it for what it was, and the sound made me curious and a little worried. It was a child, a child who was crying.\"\n\nFather Maxi leaned closer to the rectangle grate in the confessional booth. Despite the hour, the stranger's story had drawn him in. Through the shadowy hole of the confessional booth, Father Maxi could see an old man with a white beard and a bald head. He had a cap in his hand and a garish red coat that looked damp with snow. Though his eyes were downcast, Father Maxi could tell he was crying. There was a smell in the booth again, something detectable only as an afterthought. Peppermint, maybe, with an underlying smell of horse stall or barn floor.\n\n\"I went upstairs to have a look. Sometimes I do happen upon scenes of a less than cheery nature, and I thought I might do some good for a needy child. When I reached the landing, I immediately knew that something was wrong. A dog was slumped at the top of the stairs. I thought he was sleeping at first, but when I touched him, his head flopped to the side to show me his neck was broken. Rascal was never a good watchdog. I'd given him treats more than once to quiet him while I was there, and his friendliness had finally gotten the better of him. Then, I heard the noise again and turned my attention to the children's room.\"\n\nMaxi was silent on the other side of the grate, held fast by the stranger's story. He told his tale as though it were an episode of Law and Order, and as he spoke, Maxi almost felt as though he were there with him. He could see Rascal, a mutt with some german shepherd roots, lying on the floor with his neck snapped and his friendly face still set in its eternal grin of slackening realization. The landing was dark, a night light spilling out the only light to be seen as the Christmas tree stood cheery sentinel bellow. He heard the whimper from the darkness and turned his eyes towards the cracked door halfway down the hall.\n\nHow was the stranger doing this?\n\n\"I crept, not wanting to spook anyone if the child was just having a nightmare, but when I reached the door, I heard the sound again and knew it was no sleeping child. The sound I heard was waking terror, the fear too dark to vocalize, and now its owner must suffer in crippled silence as the monster falls upon him. I pushed the door open, not caring who heard, and found myself inside an abattoir. The room, you see, was small but big enough for three boys. Three beds, each a different color and each with the boy's names stenciled on the front, stood in a line. The other half of the room was free for play, and the floor was cluttered with toys and games. Two of the beds were occupied but not with the happy, smiling boys I'd seen before. Some nights, when I visit, I would peek in on them and see what dreams their faces painted. Each of them had always been a fresh canvas, a fine boy with Christmas morning prancing in their dreams, but tonight was very different.\"\n\nHe fetched a deep sigh, and Maxi was afraid he might stop.\n\nHe was invested now and needed to know how it ended, no matter how terrible.\n\n\"Tonight, I saw that two would never dream again. Their blood was a garish red as it soaked into the sheets.\"\n\nMaxi gasped, unsure what sort of confession this was becoming but knowing it was like to be terrible.\n\n\"These two, however, were luckier than the third. They had been cut before they woke and thus had expired without knowing the terror the third now lived in. They were too old, you see. The monster I had interrupted only prayed upon the youngest of lambs. When I opened the door, I had inadvertently stumbled upon the blackest of tableaus. One was a child in flannel pajamas, smiling superheroes looking on in frozen acceptance from his top, as blood oozed from one arm which he had raised to defend himself. The other, the object of his fear, was a haggard man dressed as Chris Kringel. His coat and face were red with blood. His beard was matted with it as though he'd been chewing someone up just seconds before, and over his head was held a long knife poised for the kill.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment as though to draw strength, and Father Maxi pulled in a frantic breath, his rapture too deep for breath.\n\n\"When I saw him, Father, when I saw that man dressed in red and praying upon a child's love of Christmas, I saw red myself.\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. On this night, I did knowingly commit murder. I knowingly crushed that man's skull against that frightened child's headboard, and I cannot say that my act was only to save that child. I felt wronged, blasphemed against. That he should take my image to inspire such fear was, to me, monstrous. There, I have also committed idolatry, I suppose. I compared myself to God, of whom I am a so-called saint. I suppose my crimes and my sins are three-fold then, but I would do it again to remove such a monster from this world before he could hurt another child.\"\n\nHis words moved the priest but also confused him. \n\nWas this man crazy? \n\nHad he really been a home invader turned savior or...or was he…\n\n\"What is your name, my son? What name did your mother give you on the day of your birth.\"\n\n\"Nicholas, father. I am called Nicholas.\"\n\nFather Maxi felt it hard to speak, his throat was tight with tears, and his mind was a stranger to him.\n\n\"Given the circumstances, my son, twelve Hail Marys should do it. You may say them on your way, for you have a long night ahead of you if I'm not entirely mistaken.\"\n\n\"I do, father,\" the man was almost crying. When he faced the meshed rectangle, Father Maxi could swear that he felt a warmth radiating through it. For just a moment, he felt filled with a spirit he hadn't felt since his childhood. \n\nIt was as though all the years and all the miles had been erased, and he had received a portion of his faith back this Christmas Day.\n\nHis night was far from over, though. He heard the man leave the booth and felt moved to catch a glimpse of the old saint. Much like the child he had once been, a child who had sat at the top of the stairs with his brother Aaron and waited all night to catch a glimpse, he wanted to see the man and prove to himself that the Christmas spirit was flesh and magic. He threw the curtain aside, his face awash with a rosy glow, but there was no jolly saint before him, no reindeer slay, no bag of toys or cheery elves. \n\nOnly a shivering, tear-streaked boy draped in a red coat.\n\nHe had a large cut on his arm, just as the man had said he would, but was otherwise unharmed for someone who would turn out to be the last victim of a serial killer called \"The Yuletide Carver.\" He had killed six families that year, all of them killed in their beds with the youngest child saved till last before being brutally raped and murdered. When the police arrived at the young boy's house later that morning, they found his dog, his parents, and his two brothers all dead in their beds. Their throats were slashed, and the weapon they found would match their wounds and the other victims perfectly. The last body, the one dressed in a Santa costume that he'd likely stolen from the mall he'd recently been fired from, was found laid across the last bed with his skull caved in, the murder weapon clutched in his frozen hand.\n\nThat would come later, though. For now, the priest bent down before the boy, like a penitent before the cross, and inspected his injuries. He wasn't hurt too badly. He had a long jagged cut on his arm, but his eyes told the old priest that many of his injuries were below the surface. Maxi raised the child's face, a handsome and well-made face that would likely find little trouble finding a new home if none of his family could be found, and asked him about the man who'd saved him. \n\nIt would be the statement in all the papers the next day.\n\nIt would be the headline used by many to paint an end to the long night that had held the city for so long.\n\n\"It was Santa; the real Santa saved me."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nDave knew something was off from the moment the knife sliced into the turkey, but he put it out of his mind as he served the meat to his guests. \n\nIt was nerves, he told himself. This was their first year hosting the family Thanksgiving, his family and his in-laws being in attendance, and as Dave tasted the expertly cooked bird, he set his fears to rest. It was delicious, one of the best turkeys he'd ever eaten, and he pushed the mashed potatoes onto the golden flesh as he shoveled it into his mouth. The table had been lengthened for their guests, and the whole clan sat around it as they talked, laughed, and ate.\n\nDave looked around at the gathering and was glad they had agreed to host this year.\n\nNormally, Thanksgiving was a hectic time for his family. They would start their day at seven-thirty, getting the girls ready so they could leave by nine and arrive at his parent's house by ten. Then they would have an early lunch at eleven, leave by one, and arrive at her parent's house by two. After some socializing, they would eat Thanksgiving Dinner at four, and she and her mother, sometimes with her younger sister in tow, would go out to hit the black Friday deals while Dave and his brother-in-law, Terry, watched the kiddos. By the time they got back, Dave was exhausted and still stuffed from dinner, and God help him if the office didn't give them the next day off because he was good for little after all that.\n\nBut that was before they had bought the house.\n\nThe house was so big and beautiful that it had just made sense to host both families and be done with it. Dave's mother was already planning to join in the black Friday festivities with Silvia and her family, and Dave was looking forward to putting on his pajamas and relaxing after the meal was finally put away. The kids could play in the backyard or rest in the living room, the adults could get comfortable or head out to shop, and Dave could rest a little instead of going nonstop all day.\n\nYep, Dave thought as he poured more gravy on his turkey, this year was going to be different.\n\nIt wasn't until he started putting away leftovers that he remembered that funny feeling he'd gotten as he sliced the bird earlier.\n\nThe green bean casserole, the mashed potatoes, the rolls, the corn, and even the pumpkin pie that remained had been easily stored in Tupperware containers so they could either go to the various houses his family would return to or go into his fridge to make sandwiches and plates for the next few days. Dave was in his comfy pants, the sweats he liked to wear while he watched football or did house chores, and as his full belly pushed at the waistband, he was once again happy that he didn't have to ride out the evening in his jeans as he sat on his in-law's couch like a bloated whale.\n\nThe electric knife buzzed as he cut the turkey, putting the pieces in an extra large Tupperware. There was more than he expected, especially considering how much his guests had put away. Terry was currently snoring on the couch, his overshirt unbuttoned to reveal the rise and fall of his swollen belly. Terry had eaten four helpings of the turkey all by himself, and between the lot of them, they should have eaten several turkeys.\n\nWhen the XL Tupperware was full, the lid barely closing on the almost three-gallon container, Dave furrowed his brow at the still mostly whole turkey as it sat on the counter.\n\nHalfway through filling another container, he heard Silvia come back from her shopping adventure.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, shopping bags fluttering as she came into the kitchen, \"I had to knock some old lady over, and I'm pretty sure my face is hanging somewhere in a Wal-Mart backroom of people to throw out, but I think I got everything on our kids Christmas list.\"\n\nHer joking smile turned into something more akin to \"Really?\" as she saw Dave putting away the turkey, \"Had a little nap before you started on those leftovers, huh?\" she asked playfully.\n\n\"Nope,\" Dave said, his attention on the turkey as he carved a long piece off and tossed it in the bucket, \"I've been carving for hours.\"\n\nSilvia whistled as she looked at the huge container of turkey already in the fridge, \"My goodness. I guess my turkey wasn't up to par.\"\n\nDave shook his head, \"Watch,\" he said, his face very close to the area he had just cut on the turkey.\n\nAs Silvia turned her attention to the bird, it was hard to miss as the flesh grew back in the spot he had cut. \n\nSilvia let her mouth slip open, casting a glance to the kitchen door as her sister tried to coax Terry off the couch so they could head home, \"What the hell was that?\"\n\n\"I was hoping you could tell me. Where did you get this turkey?\"\n\n\"From Kroger, the same place I always get it.\"\n\nDave went to the garbage, digging out the plastic covering, and reading the label. It looked normal, a thin flesh-covered bag with some plastic netting inside to hold the bird, but the label looked different than he was used to. A large, technicolor sun was rising behind a barn, and the words Bright Farms were visible before it. Bright Farms wasn't a brand that Dave was familiar with, but as he watched Silvia cut slice after slice off the turkey, he had to say it was a brand that was growing on him. \n\nSilvia laughed as the large Tupperware bulged with bird meat, \"Weird, but in a good way. What do we do with all this meat?\" \n\nDave shrugged, \"I'm sure this is just some kind of fluke. We'll enjoy it while it lasts.\"\n\n\"Do we put it in the fridge, you think? Would that ruin it?\" she asked, indicating the turkey.\n\nDave just shrugged again, and the two made room for the almost full turkey as they closed everything up and got ready for bed.\n\nDave figured that putting it in the cold would end their good fortune, but he hardly wanted to wake up to a rotten turkey.\n\nBesides, it couldn't last forever.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\n\"Ugh, turkey again?\" Ella asked, moving the turkey around her plate as she glowered at the golden meat.\n\n\"I like it,\" said Clare, their youngest, as she spooned mashed potatoes onto her plate, \"It's yummy.\"\n\n\"There are starving kids right here in town, Ella,\" Dave said good-naturedly, \"Might as well eat.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Ella asked suddenly, \"This isn't the turkey from Thanksgiving, is it?\"\n\nDave looked at Silvia, the two sharing a look that their oldest daughter definitely noticed.\n\n\"That's disgusting! Thanksgiving was two weeks ago. There's no way it's still good.\"\n\nIt had actually been closer to three, Dave realized, but time had done nothing to stop the turkey from coming back. Ella had raised an eye when she saw the turkey sitting in the fridge the week after Thanksgiving. Her sister was too young to take much notice of what stayed in the fridge, but Ella had asked a lot of questions about why it was still there?\n\n\"It's fine, dear. Your father and I have eaten it, and it tastes just fine. Eat up before it gets cold.\"\n\nThey had put it in the air fryer to heat it up, but it always came out just as crispy and golden brown as it had the first time. The meat never spoiled, even when Silvia had left the Tupperware out one night, and the family had just carried on eating it. Dave found it delicious, and Silvia had jokingly said that she had outdone herself with it. They had been eating turkey regularly ever since Thanksgiving, and no one but Ella seemed to show any signs of stopping.\n\n\"I'll pass,\" Ella said, pushing the plate away with the turkey uneaten, \"I've been having weird dreams lately, and I think it might be the turkey.\"\n\nDave started to chide her for wasting food, but he, too, had been having some pretty weird dreams. He couldn't say it was due to the turkey, but it certainly played a part. Dave had woken up a few times in the kitchen, the fridge doors open and pieces of turkey still in his hand. The dreams themselves were usually flashes back to Thanksgiving, watching the guests eat and eat as the turkey centerpiece grew to fill the table. The guests grew too, Dave included, though that part seemed grounded in reality. He'd put on ten pounds in the last few weeks but had shrugged it off as holiday weight. With Thanksgiving over and Christmas quickly approaching, there were no end of holiday parties or potlucks at work. \n\nDave watched as Clare took her sister's turkey as Ella left for her room.\n\n\"Don't worry, dad,\" Clare assured him, \"I won’t let it go to waste.\"\n\nDave smiled, ruffling his daughter's hair, but noticing a certain roundness to her face. Ella looked about the same as ever, but as Silvia wolfed down her own turkey, Dave couldn't help but notice his weight gain wasn't the only addition to the family. He put it out of his mind as he returned to his dinner. It was just a little holiday weight, nothing more.\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nDave pursed his lips when he opened the door to find his sister-in-law on the porch.\n\nIt was the middle of the day; shouldn't she be at work?\n\n\"Hey, Stacy. What's up?\" \n\nShe smiled, but it looked a little strained, \"Hey, Dave. I was wondering if you had any more of that turkey?\"\n\nShe was trying to put it off as curiosity, but her demeanor made Dave think more of a drug addict. She was shuffling from foot to foot and scratching at her arm, and Dave was a little worried about her. She had been coming around a lot more lately, and Dave didn't think he'd ever seen her quite this much. It appeared that Silvia had been giving her turkey. It wasn't like they didn't have plenty of it, but it appeared to be having a negative effect on her.\n\n\"Sure, I guess. Are you feeling okay? You seem kind of under the weather.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm okay. I was just hoping you had some of that turkey. It's so good I can't seem to get enough of it. Terry, too. He's been taking it for lunch every day.\"\n\nShe followed him inside, rambling all the way, Dave noticed he wasn’t the only one who’d put on holiday weight. Stacy had never been very large, at four foot eleven she might have weighed a hundred pounds the whole time he’d know her, but now it was clear she had been eating more than usual. Her stick thin frame was getting pudgy, and Dave wondered again if it had something to do with all the turkey they’d been eating? \n\nShe followed him to the fridge and, sure enough, the turkey was still in there in all its glory. The whole bird sat within as two tubs of meat sat on either side like silent sentries. He reached for the smaller tub but changed his mind as he reached for the two-gallon tub. He could always carve some more. If she had enough, maybe she wouldn't need to come back for a while. The thought was strange to Dave, but he suddenly found himself feeling very protective of the turkey.\n\nStacy looked at the Tupperware of meat as if Dave had handed her sack of crisp hundred-dollar bills.\n\n\"Thank you, thank you so much,\" she breathed out, sounding relieved as she hugged the container to her chest.\n\nShe left in a hurry after that, saying they would see them at Christmas for sure, and Dave was left wondering what the hell had just happened? As he watched her go, Dave suddenly wanted to call her back. He wanted to stop her, to tackle her, and take the turkey back, and as he closed the door, he ran heavily back to the fridge, his mind crying out for the delicious. He sank his hands into the turkey, pulling out chunks as he pushed them into his mouth. The turkey continued to refresh itself between each bite, the gouges growing before Dave's eyes, and when he sank to the floor at long last, he felt a sense of fulfillment that he'd never felt before. \n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nHe was showering that night when he noticed the first of the bumps. He felt them through the washcloth as soaped up, and his fingers shook a little as he dropped the washrag. They were under his arms, a large patch that stretched down his side, and when Dave checked them in the bathroom mirror, he was shocked. He had thought maybe they were a rash, but the bumps looked less like pustules and more like lesions. The little lumps seemed to be spreading, and Dave didn't like the scaly patches of skin between them either.\n\n\"What the hell?\" he breathed, shivering as his fingers slid over the spots.\n\nIt felt kind of nice, tickly even, but Dave made a mental note to call his doctor the next day.\n\nHe had been meaning to talk to Doctor Malcolm for a while anyway. The weight gain he was experiencing had gone beyond the normal holiday pudge, and the dreams were becoming worse each night. The guests at his table now seemed to change before his eyes, eating the turkey as they grew round and squat, their limbs shrinking as their bodies twisted. Their skin would brown, crisping until they looked burnt, and as they all turned to look at him, Dave would come awake with a start. He was becoming worried that there might be something in the turkey that was affecting them negatively. He had noticed Clare and Silvia seemed to be getting rounder as the days went by, and there was definitely more a waddle to their gate than an actual stride. He could see himself getting stouter, and with the exception of Ella, he felt like all of them might be experiencing a certain amount of binge eating.\n\nHe could see his family fattening up, but for what?\n\nDave thought for the first time then about getting rid of the turkey, but he wondered how his family would take such an action?\n\nElla would be elated. She had begun cooking her own meals to get away from the constant stream of turkey, but Silvia and Clare would be outraged. They had turkey for breakfast, lunch, and dinner most days, and Dave realized he was just as guilty. What had started as a cost-saving measure had become an obsession, and Dave wasn't sure he could bring himself to part with that cursed bird either.\n\nAs he climbed into bed, something made all the more difficult as he became fatter, he put his hand on something course that had made its way under his pillow.\n\nAs he rolled under the covers, Silvia already snoring beside him, he pulled it out and was surprised to find a handful of feathers under his pillow.\n\nHe checked his pillow, thinking maybe they had come from inside it, but he couldn't find a source.\n\nHe was tired by the time he sat his pillow down and decided to just go to sleep.\n\nHe'd make an appointment tomorrow.\n\nMaybe Dr. Malcolm could shed some light on all this. \n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nDave felt the phone shake in his hand as he made the call.\n\nThe phone number to Bright Farms had been easy enough to find, but as it rang and rang, Dave became worried that no one would pick up.\n\nThey had to have answers; they had been responsible for this turkey, after all.\n\nSomeone had to have some answers; otherwise, Dave thought he might just go crazy.\n\nDoctor Malcolm certainly hadn't been able to give him any.\n\nDoctor Malcolm only offered more questions.\n\n\"I dunno what to tell ya,\" Malcolm had said, running his hand over the bumps as he pressed against them. \n\nDave had shuddered. The bumps had spread to his back, and he felt humiliated by the whole experience. He'd been sitting in his gown, fifty pounds heavier than the last time he'd been there a few months ago, feeling like a freak as the bumps covered his ample flesh. As he got undressed, he noticed that some of them had migrated to his chest as well, and Dave hoped that Doc might be able to give him some good news.\n\n\"They aren't pustules or folliculitis, and there doesn't appear to be any drainage from them that I can see. They don't ooze when squeezed, and your x-rays don't show any growths below the skin. It's not a rash or something dermatological. I can't really tell what's going on, but,\" he hedged, \"it almost seems like,\" but he stopped himself, shaking his head as he flopped onto the spindly stool near the wall.\n\n\"What?\" Dave asked, ready to grasp at any straw he might offer.\n\n\"It almost looks like the skin under a bird's feathers. After you pluck them, their skin looks a lot like that. But that's stupid.\" he added, laughing a little as he made a note of Dave's chart.\n\nDave agreed, chuckling a little, though he didn't think it sounded so stupid.\n\nHe had looked up the number shortly after getting home.\n\nDave didn't know what he expected this Bright Farm to tell him, but he knew he needed answers. In his mind, these guys would know what was going on, and maybe they could help shed some light on his situation. With every ring that passed, Dave was more and more certain that no one would pick up. The number would be old, they would be closed, they wouldn't know what he was talking about, no one would…\n\nSomeone picked up on the sixth ring just as Dave was getting ready to hang up.\n\n\"Bright Farms General Store, Thomas 'ere, how can I help ya?\" \n\nDave was stunned for a moment, the man having to say Hello a couple of times before finally finding the saliva or the words to speak.\n\n\"Yes, we bought one of your turkeys this year for Thanksgiving.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" the man said, and Dave heard the scritch scratch of a pen, \"if you're trying to make a return, you can just take it back to the store. We don't have any kinda special policy or anything.\"\n\n\"No, I was just trying to get some information on your products. My turkey seems to be coming back after I cut it, and I'd like to know if there are any side effects of this kind of thing.\n\n\"Coming back?\" the man said, and then Dave heard his gasp, but not like someone whose surprised.\n\nHe gasped like someone whose seen a celebrity.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, it's you! You're one of the chosen ones! I'd never got to meet one before the change; this is amazing. It's an honor, sir. I hope you know how lucky you are. He only chooses a handful every year, and it happens to less than one percent of all those who buy our birds.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Dave asked, not sure what to make of all this.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. It's been three weeks. I assumed you had already noticed the changes.\"\n\n\"What exactly are these changes?\" Dave asked, hearing the front door open as his kids came home from school.\n\nElla went straight to her room as she did every day, but Clare made a beeline for the kitchen. Dave could see her as she waddled in, her changes even more noticeable than his own. As she opened the refrigerator, he was unsurprised to hear the seal coming off the turkey container. He saw his daughter, normally very athletic and energetic, laboring to breathe as she put turkey and gravy onto a paper plate. Her ankles had begun to thicken, and Dave almost thought he could see something like scales in the patch of flesh between her socks and her jeans. Her teacher had called last week about her poor performance and about her eating in class which was not allowed. She'd been sneaking extra turkey to school to eat between meals, and her teacher was threatening to give her detention if she didn't stop.\n\n\"Well, dry patches of skin, bumps, weight gain, a sharpening of the bone structure. Have you noticed any feathers appearing randomly yet? That's the biggest tell.\"\n\nShe came up out of the fridge then, her cheeks already bulging with turkey, and Dave couldn't help but notice the feathers in her hair.\n\nAs she walked to her room, the plate piled high, the turkey feathers wafted down from her lustrous brown hair.\n\n\"Don't worry, pal.\" Thomas went on, clearly grinning on the other end of the phone, \"I know this is a lot to take in. We'll send someone over real soon to help walk you through it. Before you know it, you'll also have a new home in the field.\"\n\nDave let the phone fall to the floor, his feet taking him towards the bathroom in a wobbly gate.\n\nHe leaned in close as he looked at himself in the mirror, smoothing out the skin on his face as he looked. His face seemed normal, but Dave couldn't help scrutinizing every feature. The bags under his eyes made sense; his dreams had been plagued by the eating dream for almost a month. His skin appeared plumper but still normal, though Dave couldn't help but see things that may or may not be there. Was his nose sharper? Were his eyes smaller? He looked under his neck, the double chin now prominent, and thought he might also have some of the bumps under there. He tried to tell himself that it was all in his head, but the longer he looked, the more certain he was that nothing was the way he remembered it.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" a voice came from behind him, and Dave realized that Silvia had come home while he was checking himself out.\n\nHe turned to tell her everything was okay, but as his tears started falling, Dave fell heavily to his knees and clutched at her.\n\n\"I'm scared, Silvia. I don't know what's going on. I'm changing, and I don't know what,\" but she put a finger to his lips as she stooped down, bringing her face close to his.\n\nHe could see the bumps rising up her neck as they came close, and the longer he looked at her face, the more her nose began to look like a beak.\n\n\"You're just hungry, dear. Come on, let's get some dinner in you. You'll feel better after that.\"\n\nDave tried to shake his head, but as she helped him up and led him to the table, he became less and less sure. Clare was already waiting for them, her eyes glazed over a little as she stared into space. Silvia was at the table, too, feathers rising from the neck of her sweater, and Terry's too, his nose having taken on the sharp point of a beak as he turned to look at Dave. When he opened his mouth, nothing but a gobble came out, and Dave felt his fear rising up again as Silvia sat him beside the turkey man.\n\nHe wanted to run, he wanted to deny all this, but when she sat the golden brown idol before them, he felt the drool slide down the corner of his mouth and knew he couldn't leave.\n\nThey all fell upon the bird, ripping and eating as the meat returned as pristine as always again and again.\n\nDave's fears were nothing before the bird, and as he ate, the people around him grew and grew. Their bodies changed, their features twisted, and when Dave tried to mention it, nothing came out but a thick and guttural warble. Soon he wasn't even grabbing the meat anymore. His hands had shrunk into useless wings, and they were all digging mouthfuls of flesh out with their sharp beaks. \n\nA scream turned their heads towards the living room, and they could all see Ella as she stood in confusion. \n\nShe retreated then, her door slamming from farther down the hall, but it hardly seemed to matter.\n\nThe rafter of Turkeys turned back to their dead cousin and continued to eat, growing fatter and fatter as they gorged themselves.  \n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nThomas found the door unlocked, and as he and his brothers and sisters came into the house, he smiled at the scene before him.\n\nFive fat turkeys, still picking at the bones of their meal as they warbled and gobbled. Three hens and two toms; not a bad haul at all. They had made quite a mess, but that was okay. There would be nothing here for the police to find when they came to investigate, certainly nothing to tie Bright Farms to it.\n\n\"Load them up,\" Thomas said, his family going to work, \"we have a few more stops to make before we head back.\"\n\nThey herded the birds out the door, running them towards the truck that had been pulled up to the front door, so they didn't have to chase any of them. There were always questions when people saw them running down the road in their overalls and Amish dresses, which led to other unexplained disappearances. It was always better when they came to see the light on their own, but converts sometimes had to be made rather than found.\n\n\"Who are you? What's going on?\"\n\nThomas looked over and saw a girl coming up the hallway. She looked to be about twelve or thirteen and scared out of her mind. It appeared that the siren song of the bird hadn't snared her, but Thomas knew there was a greater call than that of the turkey. \n\nHe bent down, giving her his widest smile as she looked at him with open fear.\n\n\"My dear, have you ever heard of The Bright? I find it helps put things in perspective during trying times like this.\"\n\n\\*  \\*  \\*  \\*  \\*\n\nDave had never been so happy in his whole life.\n\nBeing a turkey was easy. Eat, sleep, make little turkeys, and wander the fields around his new home. There was no job to go to, no mortgage to pay, no parties to attend, no conversations to carry, and no expectations to live up to. No, he thought, as he dug his beak into the ground for more bugs, he was wrong about expectations.\n\nEven as a turkey, there was one expectation.\n\nHe looked up as a group of birds was led to the waiting trailer, their heads held high as they waddled to their destiny. Dave could see a few of them that seemed to have a light glowing inside them, and he knew how lucky they were. There would be some new faces in a few weeks, and Dave knew that soon it would be his turn as well. Easter, or maybe next Thanksgiving, and then he would fulfill his own expectation.\n\nMaybe his glow would grow before that day, and he would be responsible for ushering in some new faces as well.\n\nSomeone called the turkeys to lunch, and the rafter came running. Dave looked up at the smiling girl holding the bucket and thought he recognized her for a moment. She looked familiar, her long dark hair in a braid, and a name tried to work its way to the surface before Dave pushed it down even as he pushed his face into the trough. That was something he had cared about before he'd become a turkey, and the food in the trough was his only care now.\n\nEat, sleep, make little turkeys, and grow fat.\n\nThat was how a turkey fulfilled his destiny."

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nGrandpa was putting away the candy after I returned from walking Glimmer back into the woods. \n\nIf Grandpa thought anything about my time with his old flame, he didn't say anything. I hadn't exactly set out to begin a relationship with one of the creatures Grandpa was always warning me about in the woods, but it was something that had just sort of happened. The two of us tried not to rub it in his face, and I got the feeling that it made Glimmer a little uncomfortable if she thought too much about it. \n\nI wondered if I would be in Grandpa's shoes one day, watching my own kids or grandkids falling for this mysterious creature?\n\nI flopped into Grandma's old rocker, and Grandpa wasn't far behind me. He sat there with a contented smile on his face, before looking over at me with a wide smile stretching to replace it. He tossed something at me, and as it plopped onto my chest, I could see it was a Reese's cup. I opened it gladly, realizing that grandpa had likely saved it for me as the kids came by to take handfuls of candy from the bowl. They were always very polite, mountain kids seemed to have learned manners before they could walk, and Grandpa never minded sending them away with a few new cavities every Halloween.\n\n\"I managed to slide it into my pocket as the Helfry boy was coming up. Figured you deserved two of your favorite things this year,\" he said with a wink.\n\nI felt a little guilty as I nibbled the chocolate disk, knowing the other treat he was talking about, \"Gramps, I feel a little weird about this. Is this okay? This isn't crossing a line, is it?\"\n\n\"Whatcha mean, kiddo?\" Grandpa asked, his hand freezing as he reached for the remote.\n\n\"Glimmer and me, I don't want there to be any,\" but a knock turned both of us back to the front door. A muffled voice was laughing as they said, \"Trick or Treat,\" but Grandpa looked like someone had goosed him with a poker. He came shakily out of his chair, stepping carefully over to the door as he asked who was there? This made me feel a little strange. Grandad never asked for a stranger's name before opening the door. Grandpa was always a good host and welcomed anyone who came knocking into his home.\n\n\"It's me, sir.\" a childish voice came, \"Sorry, I know the light was off, but Clara and I wanted to hit your house before we went home.\"\n\nGrandpa smiled as he pulled the door open, revealing the McCaffrey twins from down the road, \"Kyle and Clara McCaffrey! I wondered what had become of you. Did you start at the bottom of the mountain this year?\"\n\nBoth kids, one dressed as Elsa and the other dressed as Thor, nodded, \"We sure did,\" Sing songed Clara, \"We wanted to end up closer to home, so we figured it would be easier to walk up empty and then walk up as we filled our bags.\"\n\n\"Smart kids,\" Grandpa said, \"Son, get me the bowl for these two wayward travelers in search of sweets.\"\n\nI pulled the bowl out of the cabinet, and Grandpa rationed the contents equally between the two. The kids' faces lit up, and they thanked him for the sweet treats. He told them to hurry home and not to get caught by anything spooky on the way up the mountain. They said they would be careful, and off they ran as their hands came together.\n\nGrandpa watched them go, smiling at the two kids as they ran for home, \"Good kids. They had me worried for a minute. I was worried they might be something else.\"\n\nHe turned to find me grabbing a couple of beers out of the fridge as we stepped out onto the front porch, content to put my previous question on the back burner for now.\n\n\"Sounds like another Grandpa classic coming up.\" \n\nGrandpa laughed, having a sip as he held his beer out for a clink, \"It was while I was in the Army. Not all of us went to the front, some of us had to go guard the Alaskan front from the Ruskies, and I was sent there for my first year and a half in the Army. I would eventually make it to the front and come back alive somehow, but my time in Alaska was the strangest time of my life.\"\n\nHe was just getting ready to get started when four feet came running back up the driveway. The McCaffrey twins came hustling back up the road in a hurry, and as they fell onto the porch, they were panting. They both started gibbering about how something had been lurking in the woods near the driveway and how they were too scared to go home. They wanted to know if they could call their mom, and Grandpa told them they could. They went inside, and Gramps told me to go grab a couple of the root beers from the fridge. When they came back, saying their mom was going to be there in about half an hour after she got off work, Grandpa offered them the bottles of cold root beer, and they took it gladly.\n\nWe all clinked our bottles together, and the two drank deeply before sighing happily.\n\n\"Well, is your story good enough for an audience, gramps?\" I asked.\n\nGrandpa looked at the two kids as though weighing their worthiness.\n\n\"I dunno. You two think you're brave enough for a real spooky story?\"\n\nBoth nodded excitedly, clearly having grown up on Grandpa's stories.\n\n\"Okay then,\" he said, sitting back and getting comfortable, \"it was my first year away from home, my first time outside of Georgia, and I found myself in a frozen land during Halloween.\"\n\n*I was stationed in Alaska with my platoon, watching the shores for Stalin and his sneaky beach landers, which would surely want to take back the oil they had once held here. It never happened, of course, but we stayed there for a year and a half as we froze our backsides off. Our days were generally spent bundled up to the eye teeth and sitting in watch stations when we weren't sitting around the barracks. I picked up some skills, learned to play the guitar, and generally used my time to better myself while my checks went home to my parents.* \n\n*I was sitting in my bunk one night, trying to get some sleep as some of the others played cards when there was a knock on the door to the barracks.*\n\n*\"Trick or Treat.\" came a voice from the door.*\n\n*Private Marsh looked up from his hand and side-eyed the door, \"Trick or Treat?\"*\n\n*Private Dreigh snorted, \"Probably just those company D guys playing around.\"*\n\n*\"I dunno. I guess it could be kids from town.\" Corporal Snieder said. He was our platoon leader, but he was just as bad as the rest of us.*\n\n*\"How the hell would kids from town get to our barracks?\" Marsh asked, laying down two cards and taking two from the deck.*\n\n*\"Well,\" Snieder hedged, \"this place is pretty run down. Depending on who's on guard duty, it wouldn't be hard for a couple of kids to wander in without anyone being the wiser.\"*\n\n*There was another knock and another chorus of \"Trick or Treat,\" which drew the eyes of everyone at the table.*\n\n*\"Will someone go check and see who it is?\" One of the sleepy privates on the other side of the barracks said, \"I've got watch later, and I'd like a little sleep.\"*\n\n*No one seemed to want to get up and check, despite having plenty of excuses to explain the knocking. They were just kids. They'd leave if no one answered. It was just those jerks from Company D. Better to ignore it, but after ten minutes of knocking, I finally rolled out and walked to the door. I probably made quite a sight in my BDU pants and sock feet, and I shivered as the cold hit my bare chest. Everyone at the table looked at me, looking silently pleased that they wouldn't have to do it, and they watched as I walked towards the barracks door.* \n\n*I pushed it open and was greeted by blowing snow and an empty front stoop. The light over the door made the snow sparkle a little, but there were no kids standing around waiting for treats. Unless they wanted shoe polish or C rations, they would be out of luck, anyway. The guys from Company B, my platoon, were usually too broke to buy drinks at the canteen since most of us were sending money home to our families. Most of us were sons from poor families, newlyweds with babies at home, or kids paying off debt through service. We didn't just have candy to pass out, though we would have figured something out.*\n\n*I glanced around, deciding it was mute, and closed the door with a shrug.*\n\n*\"Looks like we took too long.\"*\n\n*As if in response, someone knocked and said, \"Trick or Treat.\"*\n\n*I opened it again, figuring they had just seen the light, and decided to run back, but there was nothing there.*\n\n*That was when I realized there weren't any footprints in the two feet of powder sitting around the stoop. If there were kids walking around, there should be footprints, but nothing was coming to the barracks or walking away from it. I closed the door, but this all began to feel like something odd.*\n\n*I might be thousands of miles from home, but this was beginning to feel like being back in the woods.*\n\n*\"Guys, there's no footprints out there,\" I told them, but I don't think they understood.*\n\n*\"Well, the snow is still coming down,\" said Jameson, one of the other guys around the table, \"I guess their tracks would have been covered up pretty quickly.\"*\n\n*\"Yeah,\" I said, \"but not that quickly. If they knocked and ran away, there should still be prints out there.\"*\n\n*Snieder nodded, looking like he meant to add something, but closed his mouth when someone knocked on the back wall, the cheap corrugation sounding tinny. There was another knock on the west wall a second later, this one hard enough to send snow falling off the roof and then from the east wall and the door again. Each knock was punctuated by a cheerful \"Trick or Treat\" but I realized that the voice always sounded the same. Not similar, but precisely the same. Each knock was followed by the same Trick or Treat, and the repetition was a little frightening. Some of the other guys had started to realize this too, and I could tell that it was spooking them as well.*\n\n*Marsh stood up then, shouting that this was getting out of hand. He was going out there, still certain that this was the company D guys playing a joke, and as he pulled his boots on, he looked at the card table to see if anyone was coming with him? Dreigh slid into his own boots, his coat already on, and Jameson started pulling on layers. Snieder was telling them to just let it go, but they were having no part of it.* \n\n*\"Don't go out there,\" said a deadpan voice from beside the door, and all of them looked up to see White as he climbed out of his bunk.*\n\n*White was from the region, a Native actually, and he had a look I imagined others had seen on my face from time to time.*\n\n*\"It's not Company D, and it sure as shit ain't no kids. It's something different, something older. If you go out there, you won't be coming back.\"*\n\n*Marsh stopped for a moment, looking at the men around him before scoffing loudly. He told White that he wasn't going to be tricked by some damn kids. The three of them walked out to the stoop, looking out into the winter wonderland, Marsh's cigarette looking strange in the cold weather as it puffed against it. They stared into the darkness outside the halo of light, looking for any sign of whoever had been knocking. I stayed in the barracks, my bare chest prickling as the cold outer air hit it, and I was thinking about going to get my own jacket. Maybe this was just a Halloween prank, and if we went out after them, we could find out who was behind it.*\n\n*White took hold of my arm as though reading my thoughts, and when he shook his head in the face of my confused stare, I stayed put.*\n\n*When Marsh heard something trill a childish \"Trick or Treat\" from the nearby mess hall, he and others were off. They tromped through the snow, crunching along as they headed for the sound. They hadn't taken rifles, not figuring they would need them, and as they disappeared, Snieder threw up his hands and said he was going to bed.*\n\n*\"If those idiots want to freeze to death, then let them. Bunch of buffoons will have to work with the colds they get out there tomorrow.\"*  \n\n*He scooped up the pot in the middle of the table and went to bed. White still had his hand on my arm, but he let it go pretty quick when he realized he was still holding it. I sat on the edge of his bunk, looking at him questioningly, wanting to know what he knew but not daring to ask. He kept looking towards the door, the sound of the men traipsing through the snow getting farther and farther away.*\n\n*\"They shouldn't have gone out there. The Kushtaka is just waiting for them out there.\"*\n\n*\"The what?\" I asked, leaning in curiously.*\n\n*He told me about the Kushtaka, a nasty little creature that was half otter and half man. They were said to help fishermen sometimes, but more often than not, they lured them to their deaths. They could mimic the screams of women and children to accomplish this, but he supposed it had learned a new trick. He told me they were devious, so it wasn't too far-fetched to assume that they might have acquired a little something new over the last century or two.*\n\n*\"So,\" I hedged, \"If I had gone outside,\" I asked, knowing the answer but needing to hear it.*\n\n*\"You'd be dead,\" he said matter of factly.*\n\n*We sat up a little bit that night, talking about legends from the area, and he was interested in hearing about the boogins that skulked the hollers as I was in hearing about what went bump around the tundra. His people had a very interesting collection of creatures, and when it was my time to go to watch, he offered to come with me and continue our conversation. We shared a lot of stories, he and I, and White became one of my best friends. Of the three that went out that night, only Jameson ever came back. They found him frostbitten in the woods behind the base, and he was discharged after losing a foot and his left arm to the cold. He kept gibbering about shadowy, slippery things and how his friends had been dragged off toward the water.*\n\n*I never saw him again, but I saw other things out there on the icy banks of Anchorage.*\n\nWe all sat quietly, listening to the story, and the perspiration running down my bottle was very cold against my palm.\n\nWhen the lights of an approaching station wagon lit the porch, everyone but Grandpa jumped a little. \n\n\"Mommy,\" both kids squealed, thanking Grandpa for the rootbeer and the candy before running to the car.\n\nGrandpa smiled as he watched them go, but I still had questions as his story came to an end.\n\n\"So, was it the Kushtaka?\" I asked.\n\nGrandpa shrugged, \"whether it was or not, they still never found the other two privates from my platoon. They dredged the waterfront, they searched the woods, but they never found a trace of Private Marsh or Private Dreigh, and Private Jameson was never in his right mind ever again.\"\n\nGrandpa watched the taillights disappear down the driveway, looking to the woods as if searching for the thing that had scared those kids.\n\n\"Remember that, kiddo. Only some people who go into the woods come out again. Some never come out, some come back broken, but some go in again and again and never feel more than a momentary sting.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to warn me about,\" but he cut me off with the sound of his bottle as it sailed off and shattered against a nearby tree. The motion was smooth, practiced, and filled with zero malice. Grandpa threw the bottles into the woods because he always had, and when he turned back to smile at me, I knew he wasn't mad.\n\n\"I'm telling you that it's okay if you want to see her. It's okay if you want to do more than see her, but don't forget what she is. Glimmer can't help what she is. No more than you can be held responsible for your humanity, but don't forget that there are things in her world that hate you because God gave you a soul and a choice. I can't prove that none of them have a soul, but I know they hold such things against us. I won't tell you not to see her, but I will tell you to be careful, boy. Be careful, and be prepared.\"\n\nHe left me to think about it then, and I heard the tv come to life as he took his recliner again.\n\nIt seemed life was only going to get tougher from here."

        "selftext": "I used to work in a motorcycle shop.\n \nOne day last year, a man brought in a fire red 1997 Suzuki TL1000S. It was in great condition, but he claimed something was wrong with the wiring. I told him I would have a look, but since I was in the middle of working on another customer’s bike, it would have to sit in the garage for a couple of days.\n \nThe man seemed glad to be leaving it and turned around and left. Now, this particular bike has a little bit of a bad reputation. So, I figured, like many other overly confident riders, he’d bought himself a bike that was too much for him.\n \nThe next morning, I walked into the shop and the headlight was on. Nothing was near the bike, and nothing had disturbed it. The key was in the ignition but wasn’t turned on, so that wasn’t causing the light to illuminate. As soon as I cycled the ignition, the light went out.\n \nThen I headed towards my workstation and started preparing for the day. After a long day, I was heading home when I noticed the light was on again. At this point, I figured it must really have an electrical problem, so I looked it over, traced all the wiring, wiggled everything that was wiggleable, and couldn't find any faults. \n\nThis time I took the key out and put it on the rack and headed home. The next morning, I arrived to see the shop covered in smoke, as if one of the bikes in the shop had been running. I quickly opened all the garage bays and started checking each vehicle. When I finally got to the TL1000, I could tell it had been running.\n \nI asked the owner of the shop, who had just walked in behind me, if he had started the bike, and he said no, that he had just gotten there. I asked him if he was messing with me, but he didn’t answer me. I told him that I’d be working on the bike today and would hopefully find the problem.\n \nLater that day, I finally got around to working on the bike. It was in such great condition that I couldn’t help but admire it. Not one thing was wrong with it. I called the owner and told him it was ready and he came, picked it up, and that was the end of it. Until the bike came back.\n \nIt had been months and I had pretty much forgotten about the bike until one day a different guy came in with it. He spoke to the shop owner, claiming it had some kind of mechanical issue. A little while later, I walked into work and it was parked right next to my workstation, so I figured the boss must have placed it there. I was getting ready for the day when he walked by and said, “Cool, you found the bike outside. I was just about to ask you to go get it and check it out.”\n \nI told him I didn’t put it there, and he said neither did he. He told me a different guy had brought it in, but he was positive it was the same bike we’d looked at a few months back. He shrugged and said the old owner must have wised up and sold it.\n \nAfter looking it over for a while, again, I could not find anything wrong with the beautiful bike. Once more, I couldn’t help but admire it. After a bit of time, I called the owner and asked if the previous owner might have any ideas about what was wrong with it. The man told me the previous owner was his brother and that he had died in a crash on that bike.\n \nI looked over at the bike with a smirk on my face. It was in great condition. I told him the bike didn’t have a scratch on it, so there was no way his unfortunate brother could have wiped out on this particular bike. I told him it was fine, so he could pick it up whenever he was ready. The man kept insisting the bike had issues and asked me to test drive it.\n \nNow, we didn’t normally test ride bikes unless the owner gave us permission. I enthusiastically said yes and got my gear ready. I hopped on the bike and headed down the road. I was taking it easy at first, but it wasn’t long before I was opening up the throttle and letting it roar. I loved every minute of it. Normally, a guy like me wouldn’t be able to afford a bike like this.\n \nBefore I knew what was happening, it was like the bike took control of itself and was heading down the highway at triple-digit speed. I didn’t even fight for control of the bike. I thought maybe that’s what happened to the original owner. I let it take the lead and it was amazing. After a couple of hours together, I finally brought it back to the shop with the intention of buying it off the owner at an affordable price.\n \nI called him back and told him the bike seemed fine, but could have hidden problems that could be costly later on, and that I would buy it off him. He refused and said he was on his way to pick it up. When he arrived, I begged him to sell it to me. I told him the bike wanted to be with me. He angrily said no, hopped on the bike, and rode away. I yelled for him to stop. He ignored me. That was the last time I saw that man, but not the last time I saw the bike.\n \nWeeks passed, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The TL was something unspeakable. There was so much adrenaline running all over my body when I rode, it was an incredible sensation. I had to have it. At night, I would have dreams of the original owner crashing on the bike, which were soon replaced by nightmares of the new owner’s death.\n \nThen suddenly, it was back at the shop. Again, with a new owner, but not a scratch on it.  I didn’t even let him get a word in because I already knew why he was there. “Came to sell the bike?” I said.\n \nHe replied, “No. It just has some problems I want checked out.”\n \n“Of course it does,” I said.\n \nA bike like that is bound to have constant problems. Fast bikes need fast riders to take control of them, otherwise, the bike might not want to be with you and you’ll end up like the two previous owners. He looked at me in confusion.\n \nBy the end of our conversation, he had pretty much given up on riding and was glad to sell me the bike at a price of my choosing. My boss was so mad at me for what I’d done, he fired me on the spot. Not only did I make a fellow rider quit, but I also chased away a client while profiting off of him. I didn’t care. I had to have it. And now it was all mine. I hopped on the bike and rode away.\n\n I never went back to that shop.\n\n[X](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EzDu0qILEuo)"

        "selftext": "\tHe was running, panting, calling out for anyone. \n\"Help! Help me, please! Anybody! Help me!\" He kept running, scrambling through the streets of the small town. The lights were off at every house, he took a turn, a right turn which appeared to be a bike trail. Liam looked behind him in hopes that the woman following was still there. The woman that followed had no eyes, but he was somehow able to face every direction Liam headed, she never hesitated, she never even took a breath. Is she dead? He thought. Is she a ghost from my past? but who could she be? He slammed down the past, tripping and scarping one hand and used the other to propel him back to his feet. Still whimpering, he rubbed off some of the blood from his hand onto his jeans, his flannel shirt also getting stained by the adrenaline filled blood. He wasn't bleeding rapidly, but even a little was too much, for maybe she could smell his blood, how else would she be tracking him so well? Liam continued down the pass, he skimmed the sign as he sped through. \"MACKENZIE ESTATE: DO NOT TRESPASS\" A sign, potentially a good sign, he thought, his mind drifted to the possibility of it being a terrible sign. A dreadful sign. The last sign. He ran, he managed to catch a breathe as he stopped to look at the great Mansion-like building ahead. He felt a familiar feeling as he ran up the stairs on the lit hill from the porch lights. Twenty Five steps later he reached the thick, heavy, double door, he didn't have time to see the details as he opened one, he didn't have time to realize his name was carved in the other. He slowed to a job, he knew she only walked, he had time now. Liam looked around the house for anywhere he could hide. He found a closet, two feet deep in what appeared to be a childs' room. The closet shudders shook as he struggled to close them fully, he sat to rest for a second, to regain his stamina, and consciousness. Liam took out his phone for a light, he then noticed the walls were littered with words. \"YOU LEAVE ME.\" A knock on the other side of the closet wall caused him to freeze, it came from the hallway. It has to be her, he thought. His hands caressed a box, a familiar box, a box he's known all his life. Liam opened it quickly as the knocks from the other side continued. Inside he found a single picture. \"It's me?\" He said aloud. Liam noticed many things that instant. It's not a question, on the wall, it's a statement, \"YOU LEAVE ME.\" meant I left her, but who is she? He wondered. This box, it's from when I was only six, that was fifteen years ago, he thought to himself. The knocking has stopped, it had stopped a while ago, he noticed. This is it. The end. And now I know where I am. The eyeless woman opened the closet shudders with un-imaginable speed. \"Hello Mother, I'm home.\" Liam said. THE END"

Things were going great until I asked where he was living. He admitted that he actually didn't live anywhere and had been couch surfing for three months. \nI cancelled our plans for trees and faked an illness.\nI ended up texting him and explaining why I bailed and he called me shallow and materialistic...\nI tried to encourage him to look for work and a place to live and he said, \"You're just like everyone else, fuck off!\" \n\nSecond guy from the internets. He looked nothing like his picture which was fine. I originally tried to rebook the night as I didn't have enough money to pay my own way, he said he would pay for me because he was looking forward to meeting me.\n\nThe entire time he talks about his mum. I try to ask him questions that inevitably result in the questioner asking the same thing back...NOPE more stories about mother dearest. \nI think, that's okay I'm sure he's just nervous as we walk towards the counter to pay the cashier asks if its together or separate. He turns to me asks if I'm going to pay half, I look at him rather annoyed and mumble, \"You know I haven't got any money.\" He looked at me as though he had no idea what I was talking about and paid for both our meals.\n\nI ended up texting my housemate to pick me up so I could avoid enduring the walk to the train station and the train trip together. He texted me not even a minute after walking away, saying how he had such a nice time getting to know me and couldn't wait to tell his mum about me and asked if I could see him tomorrow. \nI played that like a bro and just never texted back. \n\n\nReddit share with me the worst of your first date nightmares!"

Do you just jiggle around until eventually they slip in, like a turd wriggling back inside an arsehole?\n\nAnyway, today, he’s eating his ‘elevenses’ as he calls them. He eats, to himself, a WHOLE pack of Jaffa Cakes. One after the other. He just opens up the pack and slides them into his gaping mouth. I felt like I was watching some fetish porn or something, it was fucking disgusting.\n\nAnd, get this. At the end of it, as he was pushing the last Jaffa Cake down his throat with his fingers. He gagged. He just makes a sloppy gulp like he’s giving his hand a nice wet blow job. Then he seals his lips around HIS WHOLE FIST and pulls it out and kisses the tip. SLCHOP! MMWA!\n\nI couldn’t help laughing, “Craig, you are fucking ridiculous mate. You fuck!” I said to him, I had to! Then I pretended to perform fellatio to an air penis. GULP GULP GULP.\n\nHe thought it was pretty funny too, and he joined in “You fucking wanker!” GULP GULP GULP, then he put his whole fist in his mouth and just started fellating his fist and arm, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing!\n\n“Craig you fucking nutter! Everyone come and take a look at Craig, he’s fucking lost it!”\n\nA couple people came over and we watched him fellating his arm for a bit, he was laughing and drooling as he went. He even started doing a little sexy dance for us. I was the one to start throwing money at him.\n\n“Everyone get your fives out for Big Craigy. He’s doing us a special dance!” I said.\n\nHe started tucking the money into his waistband and kept dancing, fellating himself, we were having a pretty good time, all chanting GLUG GLUG BIG CRAIG GOES GLUG GLUG.\n\nThen he bit down. He started chewing on himself. Gnawing away on his arm.\n\n“Knock it off Craig my boy, playtimes over”\n\nHe just kept going though.\n\nHe started to bleed. Blood spurting out everywhere.\n\nPeople were screaming and someone pulled the fire alarm, then everyone started running.\n\nNot me though.\n\nI stayed to watch Craigs performance. He was still dancing, twirling around giving me a bit of ass jiggle now, while he continued to eat his own arm.\n\nOnly, he was crying now. Perhaps he could sense the end was coming. I knew something terrible was happening.\n\n“It’s okay baby. I understand.” I went over to him, petting him on his head. “I’m here baby. You do what you have to do.” I stroked his face “I’m gonna be here.”\n\nI stayed with him the whole time. Right until the end. He made it to his ribs before he bled out, still trying to do that sexy dance, which came out as sad gyrating and squirming on the floor.\n\nWe were together as he departed the world. I sat behind him and wrapped my legs around his body, and watching the sun set out of our office window. We were both scared, but I had to hold it together.\n\n“You see that Craig. It’s setting for you baby.”\n\nRIP Craig."

        "selftext": "Disclaimers: yes I know these are boring but don’t skip. Yes, this never happened to me. It is completely made up and fake, which is why I put fiction. (Yes, I’m not calling people stupid by putting fiction then explaining it but some people are like that sadly.)\n\nThis all began one cold Monday morning. It was like no other. Me, a 13 year old, did my daily life, really. Nothing has changed at all! I woke up to my alarm, got up and out of bed, got dressed, did my makeup and read some books after scrolling on my phone. I do all these things at 5:00 am, because I get up at 4:30. So I guess what I’m saying is, I have NOTHING to do for hours. Why do I not sleep later? My parents don’t let me. I have a lot of siblings. Too many probably. And it isn’t like we all get along, no no no. Arguing daily is all I ever hear. I get along with 3 of my sisters though. Lilly, Poppy and Esmae. We all ignore thre shouting and all have the same daily routines! Sounds weird, and it was. I was just blind to it all. \n\nSo we went to school, came home. Nothing strange. Only one thing happened that day at school. And when I say it was weird, I mean WEIRD. My other sister, who I don’t talk to or get along with, Clara, was staring at me all day. I mean literally. She isn’t in any of my classes and today she pushed the door open and smiled directly at me. Shivers went down my spine, and I was stunned. I don’t mean a normal smile, I mean her smile was along up to her ears, teeth sharp as daggers. Her eyes were no longer shining emerald green, but a bloody shade of red. And they were focused on one single thing. Me. Her head began to tilt, her finger nails growing, and now they were talons. Her hair parted, revealing two up growing horns. Not normal horns, even though they aren’t a normal thing, but hers were made of fire. She took stumbles towards me, and me, frozen in fear, stayed seated. “Go on, run. I’ll even give you a head start, seeing as I’m so much faster than you. I’ll give you 12 hours, seem fair? Or does miss princess need longer to run and find a safe place to cry?” She said, cackling. “Answer me then.” She added, seeing as I was just sitting there, gaping wide at her. “I-uh-I-I-I- do-do-don’t know w-w-what y-y-you m-m-mean” I stammered, so scared my legs were shaking vigorously. I couldn’t run even if I wanted to. I would definitely fall over. What could I do? I didn’t want to die! I was gonna die. I closed my eyes, expecting the worst, when I heard a shriek. Poof. She went up in flames, and was gone. \n\nSo yeah, guess it was a weird day, but whatever. It gets worse.\n\nOver a time period of loads of days, weeks, months even, it began to not just be Clara who was being weird. Sally, Max, even Lilly all began to be weird. But when I told my mother, she looked at me like she’d seen a ghost. “Whatever c-could you mean ch-child? You’re going c-crazy.” She said, dismissing me, then she started running quickly over to my father and they both began whispering. I couldn’t hear anything much, only that they said ‘it has started!’ Or something like that. When I say my life is crazy, I mean INSANE! Nobody ever believes me. I mean, do you? Nope. You don’t. Oh, wait, I never mentioned my name. Thought other people would have by now. My name is Blossom. Blossom Panda. Weird I know. Don’t judge me, I didn’t pick it, did I. \nSo all my siblings began doing these demon things. It was always the same, though. They always were smiling the same, said the same thing, talons were the same, and so were the horns. But they always disappeared in flames, before coming back later normal again, like nothing has happened at all. Gosh, I do sound crazy. Wait! Keep reading! I swear I’m not lying. This did happen. But mother always told me to stay in my room whenever it happened, and to lock the door, which was weird, but I did. Another thing she said was never open the door for my sisters or anyone. NEVER. It was a clear rule.\nBut one day, I screwed up…\n\n\n\nEsmae knocked on my door, begging for help. Confused, I went to open the door, before I remembered I wasn’t able to open the door, or even talk until it had been 5 minutes. So I set a timer. I could tell she waited the whole time, constantly trying to see through the little peek thing in the door. I closed the cover on it. I did NOT want to interact with her till I was sure I could. Finally, the timer blared. I could speak, not open the door. “Hello?” Esmae said, sounding like she was about to give up and leave, when I finally spoke. “I can talk to you now. It’s the 5 min rule.” I said. \n“Yeah, guessed so. That’s why I waited.” She said. “So open the door!”\n“You know I’m not allowed to.” I told her.\n“Blossom don’t be stupid! Look at me. I’m not a demon.”\nI was fooled and looked through the peek hole.\nI opened the cover, and before putting my eye to it a huge talon stabbed through. \n“Fool” she muttered, laughing.\nIt wasn’t just her. All of my siblings were there, demon forms completely visible. My parents were demons too, but they came to talk to me this time, moving all the others back. \n“Honey, open the door. It’s okay. We won’t hurt you.” She said softly. “You can trust me, and you do, don’t you?”\n“Yea, but you told me to never, no matter what I hear. I don’t trust you. Not now, anyways. Monster. Bloody monster you are. Bring me my mother!” I declared through the peek hole.\n“Honey-“ my mother\/monster thing began, but I closed the peek hole before she could finish. The conversation was clearly over. Angry, I went over to my window, and jumped. I floated down against the wind, and landed on a brick sticking out of the fence. And with that, I climbed over and was gone. \n“GET BACK HERE!” Came from behind me.\n*poof*\nI went up in flames, and teleported away…"

        "selftext": "I want to tell you all, you fine ladies and gentlemen of the jury, why I learned to juggle, and to summarize all this in a TD;LR for those of you who will not be joining the *excavation,* let me just say…\n\nJuggling has a certain…*utility…*\n\nHmmm…where should I begin? The image of my most influential *therapist’s* office comes to mind. Small room in the mezzanine of a building tied to St. Joseph’s of Syracuse, NY. Comfy chairs, a desk where he’d take notes occasionally, some simple decorations spread throughout, to include on the yellowish-beige walls that always sat opposite of where I sat, his PhD in *Forensic Psychology* from Harvard.\n\nIt was a…fucked if I know what kind of day it was. My life pretty much consisted of sitting behind my computer screen at my dad's house, often masturbating to a wide variety of pornography, some legal, whilst I predilated in a deranged, delirious fantasy world on large amounts of Benadryl. Sometimes I wrote something, a shitty short story or a specimen of my god-awful primordial poetry. I didn’t have much going for me after my mental breakdown in college that led to my initial schizophrenia diagnosis. To say the least, life was pretty lonely, but let it be known that I was robust at…*networking.*\n\nMy therapist, who, uh, if I remember correctly was named Dennis, was a worldly man, which you could see in his face. His head was topped with a respectably-cut swish of blonde hair that had started to turn gray. Kind smile and eyes that I still saw demons in; reflections of myself of course. Usually wore sweaters, with the exception of the time he wore a very low-cut shirt where he had to have deliberately tuffed it, which I recognize in conjunction with other things he did, as an *experiment.*\n\nFor the record, let's just say that I didn't understand that other people could see me staring…at…y’know…\n\nBut, anyways, the session I wish to begin dazzling you with started by him asking, “So how has your week been?”\n\nAnd I smiled. It was a special day in the life of the man formerly known as Elwood. Normally, I had to play a little deceit, and by that I mean I often added an element of randomness. I did this because, y'know, I didn't know *who* I was talking to in my, uh, *networking strategy,* but even as naively hopeful as I was, I was operating with a significant degree of caution.\n\nI think he picked up on my innate giddiness, but he let me proceed, as always, and I'm just rattling off this and that bullshit that composed an average day back then, and I come to the moment of clarity where I have to say, “and…I learned to juggle!”\n\nAnd a burst of air escapes his nose and sort of just looks inward for a second, being completely aware that, y'know, and, y'know, he just laughs and says, “Gee, did the conversation just take a hard left turn there?”\n\nI laughed with him, because, y'know, I knew what was funny, but, yea, we start talking about how that happened, and I'm sure I didn't tell him the whole story, because, y'know, part of me was still thinking I was hiding my *jokingly* $400\/day Benadryl addiction from him, but I'll relay the truth to you here.\n\nLet it be known, I did not meet these people through my *ingenious* networking strategy. I will go on record that I met the woman whose grandfather was a Russian general who role-played as my *lil sis* for me through Craigslist (have to drop that in somewhere for my defense and future snooker-play), but these college students that reached out to me found me through *Reddit.*\n\nAh, how much you have done for me, Reddit…\n\nNow, at the time, I was well to be found on subs like, y'know, spacedicks and jailbait, oblivious that my history was publicly visible, so I sit in the awareness now, after all the SSS and JSA programming that the XYZ did on me, that the peeps that invited me to their apartment some blocks from the SU campus were, in fact, spooks as I glow now.\n\nThis was obvious, in my judgment built from my present…*awareness,* as they pretty varvently offered up LSD within the first half-hour I was there, whilst we were partaking in much greenery, getting to know each other. And, of course, I snatched that opportunity, having watched a Terence McKenna video or two by this point. \n\nNaturally, this led to, amongst other things, a series of events, which I'm not going to even attempt to relay in any accuracy, because if y’know psychedelia, *you know,* but I will say that, through a series of synchronous, seemingly artificially crafted inputs from all sources that I now colloquially call a “programming session,” as I've had many now, I was left with a **message from God:**\n\n*You can make all your dreams come true*\n\nSo, with that sudden, shall we say, *epiphany,* I sat basking in the synchronicities from the people that, even though they were positively who they made themselves out to be, just as I am doing for you all now, I did not fully trust, like all things. As such, when they started pushing the notion of how easy it would be to start learning to make music, I kinda panicked, and bolted from their place rather abruptly.\n\nI was still tripping though, so when I made it back home, having done nothing but reflect on all that was possible since I departed, I paced for a moment before setting my gaze upon my brother's toybox, where I saw a couple plastic eggs. I picked one up, then the other, and gave them a small toss. And in an instance, I realized…\n\n**I could be a much more *effective* networker…**"

        "selftext": "“No more talk-box, daddy?”\nRonald rolled it back with an imbecilic grin pierced on his face. The whole neighborhood gathered behind him eager for its grand reveal. It was the first television on the block.\n“Go ahead. Turn it on, Jackie.”\nJack, eyes wide with excitement, reached for the dials. Anticipation deafened the room as a warm hum slowly buzzed the ground. The curved glass emitted an expanding beam of light, swallowing the shadows as apparitions began to dance into view. A grainy reality sit before them. The figures moved across this dimension, struggling to fill the darkness around them. Jack rests his fingers on the warm static. His breath hitches. The hairs on his arms slowly sway as his fingers glued deeper to the screen.\n“Don’t touch!” His father’s voice broke the trance. The warmth lingered through his bones as he looked back to see his father’s stupefied grin.\nThe room warped, making the tv the only light in the room. Grainy shadows danced along the walls as the figures on the screen came to a blurry pause.\nRonald’s smirk quickly dropped as he pushed Jack aside to try and fix the dials. The images remained.\n“Hey, Ron,” a neighbor’s voice trembled, breaking the mounting tension in the room. “Why’s that on the screen?”\nRonald turned his head sharply, scanning the sea of confused, fearful faces behind him. Who had spoken? The light from the television cast eerie shadows across the room, making it harder to tell who was who.\n“Is this some kind of joke?” the voice asked again, more frantic now.\nRonald opened his mouth to reply, but before he could, another voice rang out, cutting through the quiet like a knife.\n“Ron, turn this shit off!”\nA wave of murmurs rippled through the crowd. The neighbors’ faces twisted with growing unease, their eyes locked on Ronald. He stood, his knees wobbling slightly as the room’s attention bore down on him. The air seemed to thicken, making it harder to breathe.\n“It’s just the — “ he began, but he couldn’t finish. His throat felt tight, and the words stuck there like something heavy lodged in his chest.\nThen, from the back of the room, another voice spat venomously, “Now I know why we never associate with you people.”\nRonald froze. His eyes widened as he whipped his head back and forth, trying to figure out who had said it. The faces around him became blurry, shifting in the dim light. It was as if the room itself was closing in, the walls creeping closer, the crowd swelling like a thick fog. He could barely make out their expressions anymore, but their eyes — those cold, accusing eyes — pierced through the haze.\nRonald’s heart pounded in his chest. He turned back to the television, hoping for some explanation, some sign that this was all just a terrible malfunction, but instead, his gaze fell on Jackie. His son stood trembling in front of the set, clutching his teddy bear so tightly his knuckles had turned white. The boy’s wide eyes were locked on the screen, unmoving, unblinking.\nSuddenly, a face in the crowd lunged toward Ronald, knocking him to the floor. He fell hard, gasping for breath as he looked up in terror.\n“She was my child!” the figure screamed, its voice guttural, inhuman. The face above him was familiar yet horrifyingly wrong. His neighbor, the man who had always smiled and waved on his morning walks, now had no face at all. His eyes were gone, replaced by two gaping, black sockets. His skin was a smeared, blurry mess, as though someone had taken an eraser to his features.\nThe faceless man stood still, hovering over Ronald like a specter. His hollow sockets stared down at him, a void that seemed to pull everything into it. The darkness inside those empty eyes swirled, churning like a storm, and Ronald felt it — an invisible force tugging at him, pulling him closer.\n“No… no!” Ronald gasped, scrambling to his feet. He waved his hand frantically in front of the man’s face, hoping, praying for any kind of reaction. But there was nothing. The man didn’t flinch, didn’t blink. He just stood there, his faceless head tilted slightly toward Ronald, like some sick parody of curiosity.\nRonald slowly stepped back, horrified, his gaze remained locked at the mans black sockets. Something was in there. Living, controlling and seeing the madness unfold.\nThe room began to tilt, making it harder to grasp reality. The walls were breathing. Slowly inhaling and exhaling all the air from Ronald’s lungs.\n“Ronald! Turn it off!” Another voice shrieked, drowning in the hum of the television.\nThe apparitions on the screen inched closer. Their distorted, hollow figures almost breaking through the glass. The murmurs turned to screams, bringing reality to a grainy suffocation. Ronald’s head throbbed. He couldn’t keep up with the barrage of voices — inhuman whispers clawing at his mind, each one pulling his attention in a different direction. His senses were overloaded, a cacophony of fear that made it impossible to focus.\nThe faceless man-once his neighbor, a friend-crouch before Ronald. His empty sockets looking deeper and deeper into Ronald’s soul. Testing his strength. Every ounce of him wanted to give in. The rest of the room followed suite and crouched before Ronald. The only sound in the room was the soft hum of the tubes.\nA cold and heavy hand brushed Ronald’s shoulder.\n“Ronald.”\nHis throat ceased as the vibration of the voice froze his body.\n“Ronald.”\nHis skull rattled at the sound. Like nails dragging along glass. The voice came from somewhere deeper than the constraints of reality.\n“What do you fear?”\nThe heavy hand gripped Ronald’s shoulder tighter. Claws pierced his skin, scratching bone.\n“What do you fear, Ronald?”\nHis body began sliding backwards towards the television. His eyes are the only thing that can move. His body remain paralyzed, forced to just witness.\n“Tell me.”\nThe claws break further into his shoulder. Splintering his collar bone.\n“I-I…”\nHis lips, dry and crusted, tried to separate to speak.\n“I can’t…”\nHis lips bleed from the forced pull.\nHis knees grow cold and wet as the smell of fresh lake water makes its way through his nostrils. His eyes look down to see the dark waters of forgotten memories slowly rising.\n“Tell me.”\nThe claws broke deeper into his body, almost severing his arm off.\nA grainy figure manifests from the murky and cold waters a little ways out from where he stands. The breath of the creature clouds the skin of his neck, forcing Ronald to look closer.\n“Ronnie! Help!” The figures voice is hauntingly familiar.\n“What do you fear, Ronnie?”\nThe grainy figure begins to swim closer, its screams progressively getting louder and louder.\n“Help me Ronnie! Call for help!”\nThe figures face fades in close enough for Ronald to see. Bloated, peeling and emotionless. Her eyes remain nothing more than empty sockets.\nHis heart gives out as tears stream through muffled sobbing. His knees collapse to the overwhelming weight of the fear.\n“Your fear is mine.”\n"

        "selftext": "\"Nothing could go wrong, right? It was just a dare!\"\n\nThose were the words Luna recalled as she along with her friend, Jack blacked out in the presence of a tall creature with large pink eyes, and a cold smile.\n\nIt all began when the two friends were wandering the woods and mistook the pink eyes for lights and ran towards them to check it out, only to get too close and fall unconscious in front of some creature.\n\nAll because they wanted to show the other kids that they weren't scared of the woods. Luna was reluctant and wanted Jack to just skip the dare and do something else...but Jack was tired as being seen as weak, and since taking a partner out in the woods was part of the rules, he took Luna with him, they were going to stay in the woods for 10 minutes until they saw the large pink lights and just HAD to check it out....\n\nNothing could've gone wrong.....Right?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLuna: An average teenage girl who lives in an apartment with her mother, grandmother, grandfather, and little sister, Amanda. She has a secret crush on a boy named David. However, none of this will matter in a moment. Jack: A teen who is currently in high school and likes to make jokes about the younger ones around him. He can be very sarcastic and tends to not take anything seriously. He's Luna's best friend and right hand man, the two never do anything separate.\n\nThe day before Halloween she's invited by Jack black, to go trick or treating. Luna of course agreed to go and went with him.\n\nOn Halloween night, The two of them lost a bet against the school bully and were dared to run into the woods at night (despite the rules against such because a curfew and whatnot.) little do Luna and Jack know, running into the woods would be their biggest mistake yet.\n\nAfter losing the bet, they decided to skip the dare and head home, but there was no way they could back out without looking like wimps, so after much arguing, the two reluctantly followed the path deeper into the woods. It was too dark to see anything , and Luna and Jack very quickly wandered off of the path, getting lost in the woods pretty quickly. They hear a strange sound in the distance, it sounded like distorted wailing.\n\nLuna and Jack, now a little unsettled, continue deeper into the woods, albeit unwillingly. After 30 minutes, Luna looks up to see a pair of large pink lights. She nudges Jack and he looks up and shudders. The lights starts to come closer to the pair of kids and they begin to panic as the lights approach, they both look behind them and see nothing, so they turn back to each other and decide to follow the lights. As the lights grow larger in the distance, it becomes clear from the size that they're coming straight towards the duo. Then Luna realized that those were not lights, they were eyes...LARGE EYES. Then she looked closer and she saw a large robotic alien attached to those eyes. Luna pushes Jack's shoulders, signaling him to run, Jack gets the message and starts to run fast, Luna following behind. The two run fast, dodging tree roots and rocks, to no avail, the creature follows behind in quick pursuit, closing the gap between them fast. As they try to flee, the creature begins to open its chest wide and emits a foul, putrid stench.\n\n\"Run! Run while you still can!\"\n\nThe pair turns and runs as fast as possible, but it's impossible to escape. The creature grabs Luna and Jack, holding them in front of its face.\n\n\"H-Hey! Let us go!\"\n\nThe creature does not listen, instead it opens its chest wider, revealing rows upon rows of teeth, and begins to cram them both into its chest. Closing the folds of skin behind them, the two friends were now trapped inside the giant creature.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe two friends were stuck within the cavity of the creature. Both were covered in saliva and had been pushed down into the creature's stomach. As they sit, the creature opens its mouth and examines each of them. The creature enters a cave and spits them out onto the ground, Luna and Jack cower in fear of the creature.\n\n\"Well....what do we have here? A young human lady...and a young human gentleman...How cute.\" The creature growled in a deep raspy voice.\n\nLuna: Is terrified, and desperately tries to distract the creature by talking.\n\n\"Please don't hurt me!\" Luna said in a frightened tone.\n\nThe creature is intrigued by this, and moves her hair aside, examining her face. \"I'm not going to hurt either of you...I just want to understand you...\"\n\nJack: Feels trapped and panics. He feels he has to fight back despite knowing he will lose.\n\nAs the creature continues to examine them, it notices that their body temperatures are higher than usual, so it removes the clothing of the two to observe them more closely. \"Interesting....the human body is very fascinating...so many things to observe...\" the creature says as it chuckles quietly.\n\nBoth of them feel uncomfortable in their new surroundings, and as the creature begins to feed, they hold their breath in fear. They smell the sour scent of the creature's saliva and begin to gag. The creature then pukes up its chewed up food in front of Luna and Jack, nearly making the two puke from the smell. \"Eat humans...this is for you...\" The creature says assertively.\n\nThey both try to push the food away, but find themselves unable.\n\nLuna: Is able to convince herself that she'll be fine and tries to calm down, as she attempts to eat the food. She gags from the taste of the mush. Jack, warn out and hungry from the chase earlier, gobbles the food down without a second thought.\n\nThe creature feeds them again. This time the food was warm and tasted of meat and spices. Soon, the two realize that the creature isn't going to stop feeding them, which makes them nervous.\n\n\"Why do you keep giving us more and more food?\" Luna says confused. \"Because human....\" The creature says warmly as it licks her face, \"I want you to be well fed for when I finally kill you.\"\n\nLuna and Jack start to panic, and try to escape. But the creature stops them, \"I'm only joking dear, besides, I could let you go, but where will you go? There's nowhere to go for miles. You'd both be all alone...This is your home now humans, inside my body...with me.\"\n\nLuna and Jack are both scared of the creature for good reason, and decide to try and bargain with it. \"We won't tell anyone that you exist. We'll pretend we never met you if you let us go, but please promise you won't capture any other humans.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry dear, I can't let you go...just both of you, stay with me....please.\" The creature begs in a desperate tone.\n\nLuna is a bit less afraid, because she trusts Jack, and knows that he would do anything to protect her. So they decide to stay, even though the creature doesn't give them any choice. \"Okay...We'll stay with you.\" Luna says calmly. \"Yeah...\" Jack says, agreeing with Luna.\n\nThe next morning, the creature brings the two to another room in its cave, filled with countless amounts of the fleshy substance known as 'food'.\n\n\"Here you go. Just eat as much as you need to. You'll need the energy for later..\"\n\nLuna and Jack begin to gorge themselves on the food, ignoring the fact that they're eating out of a creature's intestines. Luna wonders for a moment. \"What are you?\" She asks the creature in curiosity. \"A robot, but also an alien...I'm a mixture of robot parts as well as organic flesh.\" it responds with a smile.\n\nLuna and Jack continue to eat without question, until eventually they become full. The two friends then return to their prior location, to find the pink eyes staring at the two with amusement.\n\n\"Will you be staying here for a while?\"\n\nThe two nod in response.\n\nThe creature then replies, \"Good. Now let's get started shall we?\"\n\nWhile the two friends sleep, the creature begins to feed on them. Cutting them open, sucking the liquid from their organs and veins, and sucking out their blood. Then sewing their skin folds closed once again. The creature wipes the blood from its mouth whilst watching Luna and Jack sleeps.\n\nBoth of them wake up to find the creature standing over them, watching them through its large glowing pink eyes.\n\n\"Feeling better my dears?\" It says whilst happily licking its lips.\n\n\"Yes...\" Luna answers with a nod, feeling a little queasy from the food she ate last night.\n\n\"You must be hungry, here, have some more.\" The creature says as it motions towards the food. Jack and Luna look at each other with apprehension, but finally agree to eat.\n\nLuna looks at the food, which consists of raw human flesh, and gags from the sight. Jack glances at his plate then realizes that he might as well just dig in. \"You're going to eat that?\" Luna says confused. \"Might as well...I don't want to starve.\" Jack says whilst munching on the slop called food.\n\nThe creature watches with amusement as both children continue to eat. After a while, the two are finally finished. After the meal, the creature is pleased with the results of its experimentations and begins to test their strength, stamina, and speed.\n\nThe creature tests Luna's endurance first, pushing her against the wall repeatedly until she passes out. Jack is next, being dragged around by the tentacles attached to the creature's chest and stomach, smashing into trees and rocks. A passing branch knocks Jack unconcious, causing him to fall onto the ground. Luna, meanwhile, has passed out from the sheer force of the torture.\n\nThe creature examines their bodies and finds something interesting. \"Let's see, you're both pretty strong for young humans. And as far as stamina goes, you've got an amazing amount of energy, but sadly your speed isn't that fast.\" The creature observes.\n\nLuna wakes up to find herself tied up, along with Jack. Both of them look up at the creature, who's staring down at them with amusement. \"Sleep well, my sweet sweet humans?\" He says in a low whisper.\n\n\"What did you do to us?\" Luna whispers back, fearful.\n\n\"Nothing major, just tied the both of you up for a bit....I'm not letting you leave. Not until I've fully examined what makes humans tick.\"\n\nJack is a little calmer than Luna and tries to talk to the creature, but the creature ignores him and continues to watch the two. It pulls back the skin on one of its arms to show the interior workings of the creature. Upon observation, Luna and Jack notice many tiny tentacles along with gears within the skin of the creature. Luna and Jack look in horror as the creature gets closer to them.\n\n\"...So...how do you feel?\" The creature asks.\n\nLuna: Is shaken from her trance and tries to speak, \"What...are you doing to us?\"\n\nJack: Is a little more calm about the situation and tries to act nonchalant. \"I feel alright...what else do you have planned for us?\"\n\nThe creature's mouth curls into a twisted grin. \"Oh, I have plans...plans for you both.\"\n\nLuna and Jack stare at the creature with fear as it picks up a large rock and prepares to crush them.\n\n\"Stop! Stop! Please don't.\" Luna says throwing her arms up. The creature then stops, impressed with Luna's quick reaction. \"Don't worry, I'll let you off easy. But...you have to do exactly as I say.\" The creature says confidently.\n\n\"What do you want us to do?\"\n\nThe creature's body shudders slightly as it walks over to a nearby tree. \" What I want is to do more experiments with the both of you, all I ask for is a little cooperation...okay my dears?\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Luna says uneasily.\n\n\"Very well...now both of you lick me.\" The creature commands as it places her hand near its elbow.\n\nLuna nervously licks the creature's arm, tasting the salty metallic taste of blood. Jack does the same, also tasting the metallic blood. Luna and Jack were both disgusted when the taste hit their tongues, making them both shiver.\n\n\"Well done, now I want you to come closer and sit on my lap...\" The creature says whilst smirking.\n\nBoth kids feel a surge of adrenaline rush through their veins and quickly obey the creature. \"Now you both know what I want from you. I want you to hug me.\"\n\nJack and Luna hesitate, but suddenly decide to comply as they feel helpless. They wrap their arms around the creature, and are surprised to find warmth radiating from its body. It makes the two feel safe and comfortable, as if it were their mother. The creature feels this too, and is delighted to see that both of them like being hugged. \"I wish to care for the both of you forever....\" The creature says in a loving tone.\n\nThe two friends begin to uncontrollably cry tears of joy, as their fear is gone now that the creature protects them..\n\n\"I love both of you, my dears, now you must sleep...it's time to sleep...\" The creature cooed as Luna and Jack fell into deep slumber.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSometime later, the two are awoken by a strange sound coming from outside the room. They find themselves on a large, velvet bed with fine woodwork for the rails. It was so soft and warm. The duo's attention is turned to the entry of the cave. They notice The creature's huge pink eyes glow menacingly, as if it's angry. \"What's wrong...\" Luna asks, slightly scared.\n\n\"Nothing...I've just grown fond of watching the both of you sleep..\" The creature says gently. \"It makes me happy to see you two so peaceful. Do you mind if I stay here with you for the night...so I can observe you more closely...\"\n\nLuna and Jack are shocked at the creature's request. \"Are you sure?\" Luna asks. \"Yes, no problem. Sleep well.\" The creature replies reassuringly. Luna and Jack are shocked at the creature's request. \"Are you sure?\" Luna asks. \"Yes, no problem. Sleep well.\" The creature replies reassuringly.\n\nThe creature takes off its tattered cloak, revealing a red fleshy body underneath. It lays down on top of the bed next to Luna and Jack. She notices how soft it's skin is while he begins licking her cheek. Jack awakens to the sound of the creature rustling on the bed next to them, but before he could say anything, the creature begins caressing his face. He stops moving instantly when he feels how delicate and tender its touch is. The creature then leans in closer to his face, but Jack recoils back with shock. It was too much for him to handle; he didn't know what else to do besides run away.\n\nHe tries to jump out of the bed as the creature grabs him and violently drags him back onto the bed. His heart is beating rapidly as he feels how cold its body is against his own. He hears the creature whisper into his ear: \"There's nothing to fear. You'll be safe here tonight.\"\n\nJack realizes that he has nowhere to go now, so he decides to accept the creature's offer instead. All this time he had been afraid of it, but he realized there was something familiar about the way it touched his face.\n\nThe creature cuddles against Luna and jack as they sink into slumber once again. \"You're both mine....\" The creature says quietly. \"Goodnight...\""

        "selftext": "My first lucid dream happened two months ago, it didn't last long but it was the most fun I've had in some time considering my boring life. What did I do the first time? Well I did what anyone else would do, I flew over the earth, morphed objects with my mind, and caused in every definition of the word, chaos. I woke up in my bed after what felt like the most amazing time of my life. I look at the small alarm clock on the bed stand next to my full sized bed with nothing but a singular thin blanket covering me in my studio apartment. Rubbing my eyes after seeing the time on the alarm clock as nothing but a blur I finally read the time, \"8:00am.\" \"Time to prepare for work.\" I say to myself, reluctantly peeling myself out of bed, my breath nearly visible in the cool room.\n\nI turn on my television and flip to the local news station, on which a story is being covered about how a vehicle spontaneously burst into flames. Not paying much attention to the news as I only use it to measure traffic I'll run into mindlessly driving to work, I make my breakfast, a jimmy dean breakfast sandwich and a large mug of cheap coffee. I drive myself to work without interruption after eating my breakfast and filling a paper cup up with what's left in the coffee maker and make my way inside the towering building where, 5 days a week, I sit at a desk and mindlessly assist everyday people with the accounts they hold with us.\n\nHalfway through my workday my cubicle neighbor poked his head around the corner of the dividing walls to ask me a question, \"Hey man, did you hear about that car the caught on fire this morning?\" \"Yeah briefly, I didn't pay much attention to it though.\" I replied. He then said something that chilled me to my bone, \"They're saying it was a red SUV and that the mechanics at the owners insurance company can't find what caused the fire.\" My skin went flush and my mouth went dry as his mouth uttered the words, \"red SUV.\" for a few seconds my mind raced with thoughts to myself, \"I was causing explosions in my dream. I blew up a red SUV. They can't be related can they? No, there's no way, that was just a dream, this is reality.\" My coworker noticed the change in my demeanor and asked me, \"are you ok?\" \" \"yeah, I'm fine, it's nothing. that's a bit terrifying though, just having a car catch fire for seemingly no reason.\" I replied.\n\nMy coworker and I got back to work after the brief conversation we had and the workday came to an end quickly while my mind still reeled over the odd relation between my dream and reality. Finding myself at home still obsessing over the consistency between my dream and reality, I showered, at my dinner, watched some television, and laid down still questioning my sanity.\n\nThree weeks later:\n\nI'm not sure what to do anymore, every night since my first lucid dream I've dreamt lucidly. The first week was sunshine and rainbows, pushing the limits with my lucid dreams and experimenting with what I could and could not accomplish in my dreams, but now my dreams are filled with terror. I think it was midway through the second week when I noticed it, only in the corner of my eye, I saw a dark figure looming just out of my full vision during my dreams. The only thing I've been able to make out from my partial sight of this... this creature, is the sinister smile it has plastered on its face throughout my dreams. The crooked sharp, and yellow stained teeth shown through an evil grin painted permanently across the face of the creature would give even the most resilient minds nightmares, but for me, I'm watching the nightmare, aren't I?\n\nThe first week noticing the presence it seemed as though it was observing me, but as of the last few days, it has been causing mayhem. Disasters, explosions, or people dying in grotesque ways without me willing it to happen constantly, I can only assume the entity that obsesses my thoughts is responsible for the maniacal happenings in my lucid dreams. I've come to realize that the events in my dreams bleed into reality, whether it be a car catching fire, or a group of random people in a locked room beaten beyond recognition with no knowledge of how it came to be. The first instance of the entity causing harm in my dream was when it brought down a building. I cried out in terror for the event to stop but I had no control over the situation while the entity forced past my mental will like a tank firing through a brick wall.\n\nThe morning I woke from this dream I watched the news with my full attention, \"Planted bomb kills 35 people in the empire state building, 20 injured and receiving medical care at the local hospital.\" the words of the host rang through my ears, digging into my skull like sharp knives while I felt last night's dinner toy with my throat. My body, too stiff to move, was suddenly awoken by my phone's ringtone, \"Mom\" is what my phone read. I answered the phone, my mother frantically, \"are you ok? you weren't in that explosion were you?\" She asked, her words spewing out so fast I had to take a moment to understand what she said, \"I'm fine, I was home when it happened. You don't have to worry.\" I reassured my mother. We had a brief conversation and then said our goodbyes, I went to work and could barely keep my head straight at my desk, my coworkers could sense my demeanor of helplessness for the day.\n\nI went home dreading falling asleep just to have another dream ending in the death of so many innocent lives, so I kept making coffee, forcing myself awake until 4 days later, I got lazy and allowed myself the luxury of sleep. I become lucid, my dream taking place in a foreign country, the dark figure haunting me just out of my vision. Suddenly, the ground began to rumble, at first it was tame, but it gradually began to feel like the ground was moving like the harsh waves of the ocean. I look around me, buildings falling, the screams of people doomed to the merciless and unempathetic disaster that an earthquake is known for sting my ears. A building comes hurling towards me, I wake up, it's 7:00am, I open the news. \"Magnitude 8.5 earthquake devastates Japan.\" After hearing those words, my ears went rang with a deafening tone.\n\nOne month later:\n\nI hadn't slept in 172 hours, the full appearance of an entity described only as pure evil terrorizing my mind, driving me to accept the insanity that is sleep depravation rather than allowing it dominance over my lucid dreamscape. Eight days earlier the entity revealed its full appearance to me in the most, gruesome, merciless, and catastrophic dream I've experienced to this day. The entity shown itself in full, its inhumanly wide smile revealing its crooked, blood stained teeth, glistening in the light of my dream. Its eyes, oh God its eyes, jet black and with a sinister look of enjoyment as the latest disaster it cause reflected off of its black holes for eyes. It wore a cloak that seemed to bind to its anatomy, covering its head and flowing down into long swirling, almost tentacle like appendages, some of the appendages flowing and whipping in the wind while others tensed and twitched in what appeared to be excitement like a giddy kid on Christmas morning. It let out a laugh as it willed the continent of Africa deep into the earth, quickly being swallowed into the maw that is the oceans jaws. Its laugh echoed and reverberated through my dream and rang in my mind similar to standing next to a large bell as it signaled the ending of a Sunday mass, although this was a sound only possible to be conceived in hell.\n\nWaking from this dream, I already knew what happened, a completely unexpected, seemingly paranormal instance of an entire continent being swallowed up by the earth and covered in the sapphire blue oceans that surrounded what used to be Africa. Turning the news on that morning, the entire world risen in panic, a collective and planetary shared feeling of terror that united every human into solving the mysterious and sudden catastrophic events that threatened the lives of every living soul on the earth made my stomach feel like a boulder. I pressed the power button on the television remote, powering the TV off and placing my head in my hands, unsure of how to possibly prevent the disasters from occurring.\n\nA lightbulb went off in my mind, many people have fought off sleep with the use of hard drugs, I then formed in my head a mission to find someone to sell me amphetamines, hopefully as much as I could get my hands on. Surely I thought that an amphetamine induced psychosis was a more than necessary self sacrifice over letting millions of humans die in a night, but what never crossed my mind, was hallucinating the entity in reality. I spent most of my time with my eyes glued shut like a child hiding from the shadows in the dark, the only time I opened my sore and swollen eyelids is to fish for and load the pipe that facilitates my constant race against the body's need and aching desire for sweet, restful sleep, and then, the worst possible thing happened.\n\nI woke up several days later, nearly the entire earth in ruins, I hadn't anticipated overdosing and losing consciousness. The punch line must be that I didn't die from the overdose but fought against death as the entity wreaked havoc through my delirious, lucid dream. I saw the entity do more unspeakable things on those days of sleep, things more heartless and cruel than forcing the oceans to swallow Africa. The first disaster caused humanity to scream so loud that I'm sure you could've heard it from the moon. Suddenly, I see the skies of multiple continents light up as it began to rain droplets of fire down onto the poor, suffering people, the only survivors being those in inflammable shelters. I can only imagine the mental scarring the survivors suffered as they peered out of the windows while the rest of humanity were used as tinder to fuel the entities sick and twisted idea of fun.\n\nThe following disaster took place on my last day of slumber, the sight of which twisted my stomach in knots while simultaneously sinking my heart below my feet. Giant snake like creatures slithered out of the depths of the earth, crushing skyscrapers in their path and devouring any living and breathing creature that dared to exist within their field of view. After seeing the earth in ruins, I was much more careful with my intake of amphetamines, only partaking on the brink of exhaustion, and never doing more than I needed out of panic, which was the mistake I made last time.\n\nFifteen days later:\n\nWell, this is it, my last account of what happened, my mind torn into pieces, doubting I'll every recover from the terror that was forced on me. I lasted two weeks without sleep, preventing the doom of humanity, suffering hallucinations, psychosis, and physical repercussions from being spun out. Finally it came, the pure, endless black that only the beginning phase of sleep can show. I find myself lucid, seeing the entity I wish I could forget entirely, a devilish grin on its face like always, blood dripping down its chin as it stared at me, no, into me, causing my soul to feel like a chunk of dry ice trapped inside me. I watch, no control over the events that I know will follow my loss of consciousness.\n\nThe entity raises a hand, a long, skeletal like arm with grey skin stretching over its bones, long pointed, claw like nails protruding from its fingers. Its hand was pointed directly at the moon, its inhuman smile growing even wider as it thrusts its hand downwards towards the earth. The moon began to close in on the earth, tides obvious from the sky to increase in height as the moon's gravity has an increased effect as it moves steadily towards the earth. With the last of my mental fortitude I try to hold the moon at a standstill, I'm successful for a short time, but it seemed to give even more joy to the entity as I saw it twitch gleefully while it observed my quickly dwindling strength, eventually letting out a shrill laugh as my strength left completely. I was forced to watch as the moon crashed into the earth, shattering the crust like glass, throwing magma out in every direction, the oceans evaporating before my eyes. Flames and explosions engulfed the earth when the entity spoke to me for the first time, \"It's time for you to wake up from your nightmare.\"\n\nI wake up drenched in sweat, and confused as I take in my surroundings. A tube is stuffed into my throat, acting in proxy to my lungs, several IV bags hanging and forcing liquids into me. Doctors flood the room as I look around, they begin removing the tube down my throat as a choke on my own breath, I try to speak, asking, \"Where am I? What's going on?\" My voice too hoars to be understandable. One of the doctors look at me and says, \"rest your voice for now, you've been unconscious for quite a while vice captain.\"\n\nVice captain? I ask myself within my own head before the doctor speaks again, \"Let me refresh your memory. You were abducted by an alien race we call 'the harbingers' you were on the brink of death and we had no choice but to put you into a medically induced coma until your mind was free of their telepathic powers.\" I was sent reeling, my mind broken into pieces remembering a life I never truly lived according to the doctor, while vague memories of my real life slowly replaced the false life that I had lived for thirty plus years. The doctor spoke again, \"As for where you are right now, you are aboard space vessel E-216, also known as, 'The Archangel.' We are currently orbiting the nearest habitable planet to your rescue coordinates known as X-686, and as for you sir, you are the vice captain of this vessel.\"\n\nTo be continued..."

        "selftext": "\n\n\"Bill, the sign says take two.\"\n\n\n\nBill rolled his eyes at Clyde before pouring half the bowl into his bag and holding out the bowl for him to take the rest.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I don't see anyone here to stop me. Come on, Clyde. Live a little.\"\n\n\n\nClyde looked around guiltily and finally took two pieces out of the bowl and tossed them into his bag.\n\n\n\nBill sighed, \"You're such a goody two shoes,\" he said, dumping the rest into his bag.\n\n\n\nClyde looked around, trying to see who was watching, \"But what if someone else comes by and wants candy?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then I guess,\" Bill said as he hefted the sack onto his shoulder, \"they should have come earlier. Come on, it's almost nine and I want to hit a few more houses.\"\n\n\n\nThe two boys tromped down the sidewalk, Bill's eyes roving as he looked for another house with a bowl on the porch. The houses with people handing out candy were nice and all, but the ones with unattended candy bowls, guarded only by a sign and good manners, were the best. The kids were thinning out now, the unagreed-upon hour that Halloween ended approaching, and that would make it more likely that no one would tattle to their mom if they saw him scooping up bowls. His sack was getting heavy, but he knew there was room for a little more.\n\n\n\n\"Bingo,\" Bill said, seeing a house with a bowl on the porch.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, don't,\" Clyde started to say but Bill was up the stairs and on the porch before he could get it all out. The sign said \"Take Two\" but Bill scoffed as he pushed it over and picked up the bowl. He dumped it into the sack, hefting it back onto his shoulder without even asking Clyde if he wanted any. He would probably be a little baby about it, anyway.\n\n\n\n\"Can we go home now?\" asked Clyde, looking around nervously, \"We're going to get in trouble.\"\n\n\n\n\"You worry too much,\" Bill said, grunting a little as he came down the stairs, \"If they leave the bowl on the porch,\" he explained, tightening his grip on the mouth of the full sack, \"then they ain't coming out to supervise when you take it. They get an empty bowl, we get candy, and everyone wins.\"\n\nClyde seemed unsure but Bill put it out of his mind as they started home. It was five blocks home, and it was gonna be a hike with all these sweet treats bouncing on his back. They parted so a group of kids could make their way up the porch steps, and as they made their way up the sidewalk Bill could hear the disappointed noises from the kids behind them. He shook his head, first come first served, and kept right on walking.\n\n\n\nClyde was quiet, twitching nervously as they headed home. Bill hated it when he did that. His little brother was such a goody-goody that he sometimes worried too much. Clyde always gave them away if he saw you do bad stuff, shaking and stammering and letting momma know that Bill had been up to his old tricks again.\n\n\n\nBill stopped suddenly and opened the sack, reaching in for a piece of candy before finding exactly what he was looking for. One of the last couple of houses had these chocolate peanut butter pumpkins, and Bill wanted one badly. There was one peaking just below the surface of the candy mountain that was pressing at the sides of the bag, and Bill had just started unwrapping it when Clyde spoke up.\n\n\n\n\"Bill! Mom hasn't even checked it yet! What if it's poison or something?\"\n\n\n\nBill rolled his eyes as he bit into the chocolate pumpkin and chewed, relishing the taste, \"Don't be such a baby, Clyde. It's in a wrapper. No one's gonna poison candy in a wrapper. I don't need Momma to check my candy, I can do it myself.\"\n\n\n\nHe hefted the sack again, walking a little faster so Clyde would have to keep up, and thinking about maybe digging out another of the pumpkins. They had moved into a less full part of the sidewalk, the kids mostly gone home by now, and that was probably the only reason he heard it. It was a weird sound, like footsteps right behind him, and Billy turned his head suddenly but found nothing behind them.\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Clyde asked, but Bill just shook his head.\n\n\n\n\"Nothin', let's go,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBill started walking faster, but no matter how fast he walked, the sound still followed. It actually quickened as he sped up again, keeping pace with him easily, and a glance behind him showed no one following him. What was this, Bill wondered. Was someone playing a joke on him or...maybe...\n\n\n\nHe shook his head. It was just the idea of Halloween filling his head with nonsense. There was no ghost after him, no spirit hounding his tracks. Maybe he needed a little more candy. Maybe if he just had another piece of Candy he would feel better.\n\n\n\nHe slipped the sack off his shoulder and reached in, but something seemed off. Was the sack emptier than it had been? No, no it couldn't be. He had only taken a single piece out. It just looked that way. There was still so much candy here. It was just his nerves. He took a Kit-Kat out and ate it before pulling the sack back onto his shoulder again.\n\n\n\nAs he started walking, he heard the sound again. Something was following behind him, the *plop plop plop* like worn down shoes as it tailed Bill and Clyde. It was past dark the light from the street lamps providing islands on the sidewalk with widening gulfs of darkness between. Bill felt the hairs on the back of his neck stick up. This couldn't be real, it was impossible. There was no way this could...\n\n\n\n\"Do you hear that?\" Clyde asked, his voice low and scared.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Bill realized that it wasn't just in his head.\n\n\n\nIf Clyde could hear it too, then it had to be real!\n\n\n\n\"Go away!\" Bill shouted, suddenly turning around to confront whatever it was that was following them. He got some strange looks from a couple of kids further up the block, but there was nothing on the sidewalk behind him but a single, brightly wrapped piece of candy. Candy, Bill thought, that would help him settle his nerves. He'd have a Snickers or a Reeses and be better in his mind for sure. He put the bag on the sidewalk, opened the neck, and reached in to get some...\n\n\n\nThe missing candy was obvious this time. Bill had lost about a quarter of his sack somehow and had never even noticed the loss. Was that what the thing was doing? Stealing his candy? But how? How could it be taking candy from his closed bag? It didn't make any sense. He pulled the neck shut without taking anything and threw it back onto his shoulder. It was noticeably lighter now. The weight of it was still there, but it wasn't as heavy as it had been.\n\n\n\n\"Bill? Is something wrong? You look scared.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's go,\" Bill almost gasped out, his teeth chattering as he started walking again.\n\n\n\nRight away came the steps.\n\n\n\n*Pap Pap Pap Pap.*        \n\n\n\nThey were following him, houding him, making him crazy. Why was this happening, he wondered, as the sound chased him. He had just taken some candy. Surely this...whatever it was wasn't haunting him just for treats. That was stupid, it didn't make any sense.\n\n\n\n*Pap pap pap pap*\n\n\n\nHe wanted to run, but what would it do then? His Grandpa had told him on a hunting trip that when you were confronted by a predator, you weren't supposed to run. If you ran it might think you wanted to be chased, and it might get excited. Bill didn't want to be chased. Just then, Bill wanted to be inside his house with the door locked and his blanket over the top of him so whatever monster this was couldn't get him. You were safe under the covers, everyone knew that, and Bill desperately wanted to be safe.\n\n\n\n\"Bill? What,\"\n\n\n\n\"Cross the road,\" he growled at Clyde, and the two of them crossed in the middle of the road, Clyde looking around fitfully as they did so. Jay Walking, Bill thought. How ever would Clyde's record recover from this?\n\n\n\nAnd still, that *pap pap pap* sound followed them across the road.\n\n\n\nThey were about a block from home now, and Bill was starting to feel a little silly about all this.\n\nMaybe he was wrong. Maybe he had just thought he'd seen all that candy gone. There was no way it could actually be gone. He was holding the opening to the bag. He'd put it down and check, and then he'd find the bag still full. That would put his mind at ease.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, why are we stopping?\" Clyde asked, sounding as scared as Bill felt, \"I think we should,\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut up,\" Bill snapped, opening the bag and looking in.\n\n\n\nHis stomach fell, it was worse than he thought. He had been wrong, it wasn't a quarter of the candy. Now, as he looked at the pile of treats inside, it was half of the bag that was now missing. It couldn't be real, there was just no way, but, sure enough, the bag was only half full.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" he moaned, \"No, no, no, no, no, no,\"\n\n\n\nBilly hefted the bag and began to run, Clyde crying for him to wait as he chased after him. He could hear the *pap pap pap* sound behind him and feel the bag getting lighter as he flew along. Clyde was calling his name, trying to get Bill to stop, but Bill was lost to reason. It was taking his candy, it was taking HIS candy! He had to get home, he had to make it to the house before it could get it all. The footsteps were coming faster and faster, chasing him as he rounded the corner and saw the inflatable yard ornaments of home, and knew he was close to the safety of a closed door and the warm lights of his house. The footsteps still chased him, and now he couldn't get two words out of his head as he ran.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the footsteps seemed to whisper to him, and he wondered if the ghost that was chasing him was his own greed.  \n\n\n\n\"Take Two,\" it seemed to say, repeating again and again, and when he finally collapsed on the front porch of his house, panting and shaking, his sack was as slack and empty as it had been when he left.\n\n\n\nWith shaking hands, he opened it, and there he found the proof he had been looking for.\n\n\n\nAt the bottom sat two full-sized chocolate bars, their prize from Mrs. Nesbrook who lived across the street.\n\n\n\nWhen Clyde came puffing up a few minutes later, Bill was crying on the porch, his sack in his lap and his face in his hands.\n\n\n\n\"Bill, Bill what's wrong? Are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no, it's all gone! It took my candy, and it's my own fault. You were right, Clyde. I got greedy. I shouldn't have messed with the rules. Now it's all gone and I,\" but when Clyde started to laugh, it shut him up in a hurry.\n\n\n\nClyde opened his bag and, to Bill's surprise, it was much fuller than it had been.\n\n\n\n\"There's no ghost eating your candy, silly. There's a hole in the bottom of your bag.\"\n\n\n\nBill looked at him in disbelief, \"But...but I heard it. The footsteps,\"\n\n\n\n\"It was the sound of the candy falling out,\" Clyde said, flipping over Bill's bag and showing him the hole in the bottom of his sack. The sack had been at critical mass, Bill supposed, and the candy had made the hole bigger as it bumped around in there as he ran. Bill looked at the hole, dumbfounded, for a moment, and then he started to laugh. He took the candy bars out of the sack and threw the bag away, putting an arm around his brother as the two went inside.\n\n\n\n\"I suppose it serves me right for just taking what I wanted, huh?\" Bill asked, feeling the fear disipate inside him as he began to feel silly instead.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it's okay,\" Clyde said, \"We can share my bag.\"\n\n\n\nThey spent the rest of the evening eating candy and telling spooky stories. \n\n\n\nAs he sat eating candy, Bill decided that, from now on, he would listen when something told him not to take too much.\n\n"

        "selftext": "I, 26 Male woke up early, as I always do, ready to tend to my farm and tenderness my livestock. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a warm golden glow across the fields. It was a peaceful morning, or so I thought. As I made my way to the barn, I couldn't help but notice the neighbors' property, situated about three acres away from mine. The Smithsons had always been a peculiar bunch, but lately, something had changed. They had become increasingly hostile towards me for reasons I couldn't comprehend. It started with petty acts—a few misplaced tools, gates left open, and rude gestures exchanged from across the distance. At first, I dismissed it as mere annoyance, but their behavior escalated, becoming more sinister with each passing day. Their animals would occasionally escape and trample my crops, while my fences were mysteriously vandalized overnight. I confronted them once, hoping to resolve the issue like mature adults. However, the Smithsons met me with cold glares and venomous words. They accused me of encroaching on their land and spreading rumors about me among the townsfolk. Their hostility was unwarranted, leaving me feeling bewildered and hurt. The stress from their relentless harassment began taking a toll on my farm. My animals grew restless, my crops struggled to thrive, and the once peaceful atmosphere was now clouded by an oppressive tension. Every day, I would wake up with a sense of dread, anticipating the next malicious act from the Smithsons. But it was the night when things took a truly disturbing turn. As I lay in bed, trying to find solace in sleep, I would hear strange sounds coming from the direction of the Smithsons' property. Whispers carried by the wind, dark laughter that chilled me to the bone, and sometimes, unexplained lights flickering in the distance. The harassment had crossed the boundaries of the physical world. It was as if the Smithsons were tapping into something beyond comprehension, using dark forces to torment me. Sleep-deprived and desperate, I sought help from the townsfolk, hoping someone would shed light on this inexplicable situation. However, their response was always the same—averted eyes and hushed conversations, as if they were afraid to speak the truth. Left with no other choice, I decided to investigate the paranormal occurrences myself. Armed with a camera and a brave heart, I ventured closer to the Smithsons' property under the cover of darkness. What I discovered shook me to my core. In the depths of the night, the Smithsons performed rituals—a twisted communion with forces unknown. They danced around a flickering bonfire, their faces twisted with maniacal glee. The air crackled with an electric energy, and I could sense an unholy presence enveloping the area. I managed to capture snippets of their dark rituals on camera, proof of their involvement in these supernatural acts. Armed with this evidence, I went to the authorities, who were finally compelled to take action. The Smithsons were exposed, and their property was investigated thoroughly, unearthing a hidden cache of occult paraphernalia. The town breathed a collective sigh of relief, and the Smithsons were swiftly removed from the neighborhood. Life returned to normal, or as normal as it could be after such a harrowing ordeal. The whispers ceased, the threats vanished, and the land once again thrived under my care. But even now, years later, I can't help but cast an apprehensive glance toward their abandoned property. The memories of their sinister acts and the eerie whispers still linger, a chilling reminder of the darkness that can reside within the hearts of those who were once considered neighbors."

When I say they live in houses, I don't mean that they construct and occupy dwellings of their own design. They don't create homes to accommodate a specific lifestyle or purpose. They live in our houses.\n\nBut when I say they live in our houses, I don't mean they live with us, as a pet or fellow tenant. Of course, they do live with us, I just said they live in our houses after all, but they live in the spaces of the house we are not meant to go ourselves. They live in the narrow hollow spaces in the walls, or the dirty crawlspaces under the house. They live in the cracks in the corners and behind the molding that has pulled away from the wall. They live in vents, or in the space between the ceiling and the floor of the story above.\n\nThe scurry about when they think you aren't around. Honestly you never want something in your house that scurries. But they're quick, and they have great vision. They'll usually see you before you see them. And they'll usually watch you from their little hiding places. They'll usually scurry away if you turn on a light, or if they feel your footsteps. They'll usually only watch from their little hiding places, but not always.\n\nSometimes they linger a little bit when a light comes on, observing your face for a few moments before bolting back into the wall. Sometimes they come out while you're still awake and moving around. Sometimes they watch you from their little hiding places, but sometimes they watch you from a little bit closer. Sometimes they get curious and follow you to your bed.\n\nThey have a grotesque shape, rigid but bending to fit whatever opening is available for them. They are small enough to get around but big enough to be seen scurrying across a room. They make sounds, small chittering noises that you can barely hear, unless you remain perfectly silent. At night, I can hear them in the walls. I can hear them in the ceiling. I can hear them in the room with me.\n\nThey live in houses, our houses. They live in the walls and the crawlspace, and we just can't seem to get rid of them. They scurry into the vents and behind the crown molding. They live in our houses and we can't get rid of them. Usually I sleep with the lights on, but tonight there's a storm. Sometimes the power goes out during storms. I can't get rid of them. They live in our houses. All of our houses. Sleep with your lights on."

I slowly approached the sink where once again to my horror the faucet was turned off and the sink bowl was dry as if the faucet handn’t ever been turned on. I quickly backed out of the bathroom where behind me I saw the shadow of a man staring me down, and even though it was a shadow I swear I could feel its eyes looking me down. I looked around to see what could be making the shadow but saw nothing. When I looked back, it was still there looking down on me with its nonexistent eyes I rushed back to my bed and fell asleep in a cold sweat.\n\nThis story is as true as it gets but, I still spent some time writing so I hope you enjoyed!"

I had kept them at first, hiding them so no one would find them, but I burned them now, not wanting them near me.\n\nI picked up my phone to call Daniel, but it went straight to voicemail. I tried my uncle, but Uncle Mike was hoping I had seen him. He said Daniel had been missing for about a week now, and everyone was getting pretty worried. I can hear him calling me as I sit on the floor with my knees against my chest, trying not to hyperventilate, but I know it's useless. That feeling is the closest I can come to drowning, the closest I can come to understanding why Catherine writes these letters.\n\nDaniel, Carter, Clint, Henry, they're all gone now.\n\nI'm the last one that Catherine hasn't got.\n\nWhen we were kids or early teens, we would all go stay at Grandpa's Cabin over the summer. Grandpa was long dead, Grandma too, but the cabin was always called such. My mom and dad would usually come up first to get it ready, and I loved the times before my cousins got there, the times I could just enjoy the cabin. I haven't been back in years, not since we went to look for Clint, but I can still remember the cabin. It was more a lodge than a cabin, and Dad claimed that Grandpa's Dad (our Great-Grandpa) had built it by hand. It was made from the huge old trees in the area, and it had a big area downstairs with four rooms above it. The rooms were easily as big as hotel rooms, the Motel 6 kind, and they held our family and the families of my cousins easily. \n\nDad had a brother, Uncle Mike, and a Sister, Aunt Claire, and both of them had two kids.\n\nCatherine was the only girl in the family, other than Aunt Claire, and the youngest. This meant she tried extra hard to keep up with her older cousins and it often led her into trouble. The time she fell out a tree and broke her arm, the time she'd bruised her legs and butt jumping her bike over a fifteen-foot drop, the time she'd nearly drowned at Carffer's Pond, were all times she was trying to keep up with us. We were merciless too, giving her no quarter, and it must have been miserable for her.\n\nWe loved to hike and swim and spend time in the cabin, but the thing we all looked forward to seeing the most when we came out here was The Blue.\n\nThe Blue was a hole in the woods, more like a pit than anything, with water inside that was perfectly blue, like the stuff inside the jar where the barber keeps his combs. It went thirty feet into the earth, the precipice sheer and easy to stumble into if you weren't paying attention. The water inside was so blue that it hurt your eyes if you looked at it for too long, and it always looked artificial to me. Someone had hung a bridge over it, a rickety thing that swung across on ropes, and my cousins and I thought it was great fun to go and tempt fate by bouncing on it and making it sway.\n\nThinking about it now makes me downright shudder, but all kids think they're immortal.\n\nI was twelve when it happened, but it could have happened before then easily.\n\nWe had been at the cabin a week, swimming and fishing and generally enjoying our time in the woods when Clint said he wanted to go see The Blue today. He said it quietly, because if he had said it any louder, his mom or my mom would have heard and that would have been the end of it. All the adults knew about The Blue and had forbidden us to go anywhere near it. Dad had told us stories about playing on that bridge when he and Uncle Mike were kids, but Aunt Claire had always been too scared to go on that rickety old thing. I think my Dad knew that we were going out to The Blue, probably expected it, and never expressly forbade us to go there, like my mom did. He knew that forbidding it would just make it that much more enticing, and if he let us get it out of our systems, The Blue would become boring all on its own.\n\nI don't think he believed something tragic would happen, but if he had, he might have kept a closer eye on us.\n\nWe told our mothers we were going on a hike, Uncle Mike, Uncle Dale, and my Dad having gone out fishing that morning, and they said that was fine but to be back by lunchtime.\n\nWe had made our way out as quietly as possible, thinking ourselves clever for not letting Catherine hear us making plans, but no sooner had we jumped off the back porch than here she came with a “Wait for me!”Clint grumbled that we should just run off without her, but that was when my Mom poked her head out and told us not to forget Cat. Catherine seemed pretty pleased with herself as she followed us out of the yard, and as we hiked towards The Blue, she realized where we were going.\n\n“We can't go there,” She said, looking scandalous, “Mommy said it was off limits.”\n\n“Well Mommy isn't here,” said Daniel, “So if you don't want to come, then turn around and go back.”\n\nCatherine seemed to think about it but must have decided it was too far to walk back on her own. We were about two miles into the woods, and despite her desire to follow us everywhere, Catherine was kind of a scaredy-cat. She didn't like being by herself, and it usually led to her getting hurt when she tried to follow us into dangerous situations. She still followed us, but suddenly she was a safe distance away as we made our way toward The Blue.\n\nWhen the trees parted and the edges of the pit opened up, we knew we had arrived.\n\n“There it is,” Clint breathed, the lip coming into view not long afterward, “So cool.”\n\nWe had seen it dozens of times but it was always awe-inspiring.\n\nThe hole was like something punched by a meteor, the edges jagged and uneven. Maybe there was a meteor at the bottom, maybe it’s what made the water so blue, but we had never seen it, well, not yet. We were only really interested in the bridge that day and cared nothing for the natural beauty. We spent the first few minutes just leaning over the edge and spitting into the water below. We couldn’t see it when it hit, but we knew it had.\n\nIf the side had crumbled we’d have all gone in and then this story might be very different.\n\n“Let’s go on the bridge,” one of them said.\n\nI think it was Clint but it could have been any of them. It was definitely Carter who agreed, but we all wanted to go. The bridge was what we lived for, the thrill we came back for, and the second my hands touched the ropes of that swinging death trap, I felt the adrenaline begin to pump within me.\n\nThe bridge was in disrepair from the first time we found it, and it had only gotten worse over the years. It was missing a few boards, the ropes frayed and peeling, and we should have known it was only a matter of time before there was a problem. When we got to the bridge, all of us crowding onto it as we usually did, Henry moved to the front and began swinging it from side to side. The ropes creaked as we all laughed and held on. Henry was quite a bit larger than most of us, and when he rocked the bridge, he really rocked the bridge. It swayed wide over the gap, and we all laughed and joked as we swayed along with it.\n\nWe had been cheating death for a couple of minutes when we realized that someone was missing.\n\nWe looked back towards the lip of the pit and saw Catherine hunkered in the woods. She was miserable, not liking the sight of us trying to throw ourselves into The Blue, and didn’t seem to want any part of it. We joked and picked at her, but I wish now that I had seen the fear in her eyes and thought better of what we were doing.\n\nI should have been a better big brother on that day.\n\n“Come on, Cat,” Clint said.\n\n“No way,” Catherine said, grabbing one of the trees like we might try to pull her onto the bridge.\n\n“Don’t be a scaredy-cat,” Clint sing-songed, repeating the phrase scaredy-cat again and again as the rest of us picked it up.\n\nI didn’t pick it up till last, but I chanted it right along with the rest of them.\n\nCatherine was clearly on the verge of tears, but she still had her pride. She stomped over to the bridge, as indignant as anyone could be at six, but as she came to the edge, she started to look unsure again. Her hands shook if she reached for the ropes, and when Henry stepped out of the way, she walked hesitantly onto the rickety boards of the bridge. Henry closed off her retreat, and she stepped closer to our group as she tried her best not to cry.\n\n“All right, Henry, let’s get some big swings this time.” Clint trumpeted.\n\nHenry seemed all too willing to oblige, and soon the bridge was rocking farther than I had ever seen it rock before. It was swinging over The Blue like a pendulum, and even I was afraid that we might go in. It was pivoting back and forth, the ropes groaning like a ship's mast in a high wind, and I wondered for a moment what it would be like to fall into that blue water. You could only really tread water for so long before you went under, and I wondered how long that would be. Would anyone get back with help before I drowned?\n\nI didn’t see it when Catherine fell off the bridge, but when Henry yelled out a moment later, I looked over and saw her when she hit The Blue. She didn’t splash, the water just staying put, and she came up thrashing as she tried to get her head above the crystal blue surface. The water must’ve been thick because she was really struggling to make any headway in it. She was calling for help with big, gasping breaths. The bridge had stopped moving, all five of us looking down into the chasm and knowing that we were in trouble. We had been playing where we shouldn't, we had been being stupid, and now someone had gotten hurt. \n\n“We've gotta get help,” Daniel yelled, and his words were like a starter pistol.\n\nI ran for the cabin to try and get help, Daniel and Carter coming with me. I prayed Catherine could tread water while we ran the twenty or so minutes back to the cabin, but I knew that Catherine wasn’t a strong swimmer. I didn’t expect she would still be treading water by the time we came back, but I prayed to God that she would be. Mom, Aunt Clair, and Aunt Liz were at the table when we ran in, drinking tea and laughing, but they jumped up when we told them what had happened. Mom came running, grabbing a rope and running along behind us, as we went back. My dad and uncles still weren’t back from fishing, but Aunt Liz said she would call emergency services to hopefully get someone down here. The run back took a little longer, all of us winded from the sprint to the cabin, but Catherine had only been in the water forty-five minutes by the time we got back. That wasn't so long, I thought. She could still be fine.\n\nIt was forty-five minutes too long, though.\n\nClint said she had gone under about five minutes after we left and she hadn’t come back up since. My mom tied the rope off to a tree, but it was too short to make it down to The Blue. She went back for another rope, my Aunt staying with us, and by the time she got back, she had emergency services in tow. They brought longer ropes and divers, and soon they were in The Blue trying to find her. The divers who went in said The Blue was miles deep, and the water was like trying to swim in Jell-O. They went as deep as they dared, but they never found Catherine. My Dad and Uncles came back from fishing to find my mother inconsolable and Catherine presumed dead. They didn’t have the heart to punish us for what happened, and all of us said it had been a terrible accident. We left out the part where we had been rocking the bridge, and they decided that Catherine must’ve just lost her balance and fallen in. They shouted a little that they had told us to stay away from The Blue, but they could see how shaken up we were by what had happened.\n\nThey thought we had been punished sufficiently, but it appeared that something else disagreed.\n\nWe never went back to Grandpa‘s cabin again. It held bad memories for all three of us, and I don’t think any of Dad's siblings went back either. None of my cousins went there willingly again. It held terrible memories for all of us, and I think that we knew something dark was waiting for us to come back.\n\nThe first letter showed up two weeks after Catherine’s funeral.\n\nThe two weeks after we buried my sister were a really bad time for me. I was sad about what had happened to Catherine, but I was also unbelievably riddled with guilt over it. I felt that I had every right to be guilty, I had played a part in what had happened, but I didn’t think I had been the biggest part. Looking back, my cousins were really the ones who had pushed her to get on the bridge, but I hadn’t stood up and tried to protect her. I had failed in my duties as a big brother, and she had paid the price.\n\nMy parents had been talking about back-to-school shopping, something they seemed unwilling to do, and my mother was trying to guilt my father into getting it done. They were both distraught over the loss of Catherine, but my mother had always been a bit of a realist when it came to things. My sister was dead, but I would still have to start school whether I wanted to or not and I would need things to begin school with. While they argued about it, Mom told me to go get the mail and see if the circular had come yet. I think she wanted coupons out of it, but I can’t really remember.\n\nI would find it hard to remember much about that day when I looked back, except for the letter.\n\nI went out to the mailbox and found that there was a circular in there. There were also two bills, a couple of condolence cards, and a letter in a strange envelope. The envelope felt moist, the paper, seeming damp and moldy, and I didn’t like touching it. I started to sandwich it between the condolence cards, and that’s when I noticed it had my name on it.\n\nFrom Catherine Mansley to Justin Mansley\n\nI felt the other pieces of mail slip through my fingers when I read the name. It couldn’t be. Catherine was dead, dragged into The Blue by whatever lay below, and there was no way this letter was from her. I thought it might be a trick from one of my cousins, but they had all seemed as Guilty about what happened to Catherine as I was. Clint hid it behind a constant stream of humor, but he still clearly felt like we needed to hide what they had done. Like me, he realized that we would get in trouble if they knew that we had been goofing around and I didn’t think he would be stupid enough to try to pull something like this.\n\nI opened the strange envelope. I didn’t want to. I wanted to throw it away, but I had to know what was inside. Even at twelve, I knew there was no way this could be from Catherine. Dead people did not send letters to the living, but I still had to know what was going on here.\n\nThe letter was brief.\n\nAll of Catherine’s letters have been brief.\n\n*It’s your fault, you should be the one in The Blue.*\n\nI just stood there for a moment, looking at the letter. I started to rip it up, thinking again that this was a cruel joke, but something stopped me. It isn’t something I can really explain, but tearing that paper felt like tearing the page out of the Bible. It just felt fundamentally wrong, and I ended up stuffing it into my pocket instead as I collected up the mail that I dropped on the pavement. I couldn’t destroy it, but I didn’t want my parents to find it either. What would they say if they saw it? Would they know what I had done? I couldn’t risk that. I was in enough turmoil over my sister’s death without my parents blaming me for it.\n\nI came in and dropped off the mail, sneaking back up to my room as I hid the letter in a box of baseball cards under my bed.\n\nIt wouldn’t be the only one soon enough.\n\nOver the next two months, I got two more letters, each on the same day of the month. After the second one, coming about two weeks after school started, I started checking the mail every day to make sure the letter didn’t get picked up by my parents. I hid them in the same box, each of them reading similar to the one before it.\n\n*I’m lonely.*\n\n*I miss you.*\n\n*It’s your fault.*\n\n*Come to The Blue.*\n\n*Come to The Blue.*\n\n*Come to The Blue.*\n\nIt was October, the leaves already a vibrant orange in the front yard, when Clint called me after I received my third letter.\n\n“Are you doing this?” he asked, sounding scared and angry.\n\nIt sounded like he was shaking something in the background, paper or something, and I asked him what he was talking about.\n\n“These letters. Carter and I have each gotten three. If this is you, you need to stop. We all feel bad about what happened to Catherine, me especially, but this is going to get us in trouble. If one of our parents found those letters then we could be in serious trouble for what we did. Your sister is gone man, and I’m sorry for it, but this isn’t gonna bring her back.“\n\nI knew what he was talking about without having to be told. I told him I had been receiving them too, and that I bet Henry and Daniel had been getting them as well. I still didn’t think they were from Catherine, there was no way for dead people to write you letters, but somebody clearly knew what we had done in the woods. Clint said that was impossible. We had been the only ones in the woods that day, or at least the only ones around The Blue when Catherine had fallen in. He said it had to be one of us, and before he hung up he said he was going to call Daniel and see if it was one of them playing a bad joke.\n\nHe called me back twenty minutes later and said they were just as freaked out as he was.\n\n“He says he’s been dreaming about The Blue, and he knows that Henry has too. Henry is talking about The Blue a lot these days and Daniel is scared that he’s going to tell somebody what really happened.\"\n\nI hadn’t thought of that either, but I suppose by then I thought it might be what we deserved.\n\nThe letters kept coming on the same day every month, and I realized that it was the same day that Catherine had gone into The Blue. We all received our letters on the anniversary of her fall, and as Christmas came around we all started to worry about Henry. Henry had always been a big boy, looking like a high schooler even though he was a year younger than Daniel, but when he came to our house for Christmas, he looked like he had lost about thirty pounds. It also looks like he might’ve been pulling out his hair. He was twitchy, quiet, and nothing like the boisterous boy had been a few months ago. Daniel told us that when he talked, it was about The Blue. He said he dreamed about it, drew pictures of it, and in the pictures, Catherine was floating in it. Henry and Clint had been the last ones to see her alive in all that blue, but in the pictures, she was waving at them from the water.\n\n“He says that in his dreams, she comes out of The Blue and tries to get him to jump in. She told him that it’s nice down there, that it’s cool and wonderful, and that he would really enjoy it if you were to join her. He keeps talking about joining her, but I don’t know how we would. Dad told Mom that we were never going back to the cabin, not after what had happened. They’re all really afraid that one of us will fall off that bridge if they went back.\" Daniel told us as we sat at the kid's table in the den.\n\nHenry sat at the table with us, but he did little more than move his fork around in his mashed potatoes, not really eating anything.\n\nA couple of months later, my aunt and uncle put Henry in a psychiatric facility. Dad told us he was sick, but Daniel said he'd started having night terrors and he'd almost completely stopped eating. He couldn't go to school, he wouldn't play, and it was like he'd just shut down completely. Daniel was afraid to sleep in the same room with him, and he really hoped that whatever this place was they had taken Henry to, they would fix him.\n\nA month after that, Henry broke out of that facility and was never seen again.\n\nNo one was quite sure how he had gotten out without being seen, but Henry was gone. \n\nEverything in the room was exactly the way it had been the night before, including the restraints that were still buckled in the same way they had been when the orderly had put him to bed. The police thought for sure they would find him walking along the road or something, maybe in the woods around the place, but they never did. Uncle Mike and Aunt Liz were devastated, but the four of us were pretty sure we knew where Henry was. They would never find him, just like they’d never found Catherine. We were all pretty sure that he was in The Blue. The facility they put him in was about thirty miles from Grandpa‘s cabin, but we were still certain that’s where he was.\n\nWhen I got my letter that month all my questions were answered.\n\n*Henry came to join me in The Blue. You should all come and see him. He’s much better now.*\n\nDaniel and Clint called me later that day, and I told them I had gotten the same news.\n\n“What are we gonna do?” Clint asked.\n\nI didn't have an answer.\n\nCarter went next, though it took him two years to do it.\n\nCarter was about two years younger than Clint, the youngest of the cousins besides Catherine, and he held out only because he and Clint were so close. I don’t think Clint‘s parents ever had any inkling of what was going on with their son, but by Thanksgiving, he was looking the same way Henry had. He was barely eating, and only then because Clint coaxed him. Clint had changed since that summer when we lost Catherine. He had softened a little, and I think he had realized that life was a little more fleeting than he had believed. He said Carter wasn’t sleeping, was having nightmares about The Blue, and told Clint that Henry was in the dreams too. Carter was smarter than the rest of us, not that this was saying much, but I think it helped him put off the bad feelings and get through it for a while. Unlike Henry, Carter just looked tired all the time, and when he came to my fourteenth birthday that year, the bags under his eyes looked like bruises.\n\n“It's not as bad as it looks,” he told me with a faint smile, “My parents sent me to a doctor who got me some meds that help. Well, not really help, but they let me sleep. They make it harder to get out of the dreams, though.”\n\nI asked him about the dreams, and despite Clint telling me not to make him think about them, Carter said he didn't mind. Daniel and I sat close, like students listening to a lecture, and Carter reeled a bit as he thought about it, not seeming sure where to begin.\n\n“I'm standing on the bridge. It's nighttime, it's always nighttime in the dreams, and I'm looking down into The Blue. It's,” he blinked really fast for a few seconds and shook his head before going on, “It's glowing in the dreams. It's always glowing. As I stand and look down, Catherine and Henry come up out of the water and wave at me. They tell me to jump. They tell me to join them. They tell me how great it is down there. As they tell me, I kind of want to jump. I,” his eyes shut for a count of five before he jerked awake with a start, “I want to go to them. There are no dreams in The Blue, no nightmares or letters or anything. It's just peaceful.”\n\nHe leaned over onto Clint and started snoring, and Clint accepted his weight gratefully.\n\nCarter nearly made it to my fifteenth birthday party, and a lot of that was due to Clint.\n\nThis whole thing brought us all closer together, and we called each other often. Daniel actually came to live with us for a while, his parents having trouble coping with Henry's disappearance. Aunt Liz was eventually put into the same facility Henry escaped from after she tried to overdose on sleeping pills, and Uncle Mike soon moved in with us too. He and Daniel looked sad most of the time, but I think they enjoyed having us close.\n\nDaniel had started having the dreams a lot more often, but he was fifteen and starting high school, and he had other things to occupy his mind. If there was anyone who could have used our help, it was Clint. Clint had started high school too, he and Daniel were a year older than me, but he missed a lot of days while he tried to take care of Carter. Carter was losing his mind at an alarming rate, and Clint confided that he had started strapping him into the bed at night.\n\n“I've caught him sleepwalking to the front door, and he fights me when I try to get him back to bed. I don't know how my mom and dad haven't noticed yet, but I may have to tell them soon. He's like a zombie, and I don't know how he makes it through school every day.”\n\nA week before my fifteenth birthday, Aunt Claire called us to tell us that Carter and Clint had gone missing. \n\n“They both disappeared in the middle of the night.” she said tearfully, “And I just don't know what to do. The police have no idea, but I was hoping that maybe they had gone to your house for some reason and they were safe.”\n\nMy mom said they hadn't, but she and Dad said they would help her look for them.\n\n“Clint's bike is gone too. I told Dale that Indian Scout was a bad idea, but he swore Clint was responsible and that he wouldn't just up and leave without telling us.”\n\nDaniel and I were eavesdropping, and he said we both knew where they were. \n\nAfter my parents left to join the search party, we piled into Daniel's Jeep and went to Grandpa's cabin, as little as we wanted to. Uncle Mike had left him the Jeep when he got his driver's license, but this would be the longest trip we had made in it. Grandpa's cabin was about two hours from my house, and despite having left a note, I was sure my mother would be worried sick. The drive seemed to take forever, but when we pulled up in front of the cabin and found Clint's motorcycle out front, we knew what we would find.\n\nIt was dark when we got to The Blue, and Clint was kneeling on the ground as if he were praying. \n\nThe dirt beneath his forehead had turned to mud, and he didn't even look up when we approached. \n\n“I didn't catch him in time.” Clint said through tears, “I didn't wake up until the sun was nearly up, and by then it was too late. He beat me here by minutes, though I don't know how. I tried to catch him, but he was already standing on the edge when I arrived. I begged him to come back, but he just pitched over and went into The Blue. He was right,” he said, pointing, “It glows at night.”\n\nI hadn't even noticed, but as I looked up, I could see it now. The Blue was glowing like the iridescent moss you sometimes found in caves, and as I looked down, I thought I saw three figures swimming within it. They were looking up at me, but I leaned away before they could entice me over.\n\n“Clint,” Daniel said, but he didn't respond, “Clint, we need to go.”\n\n“Go?” Clint asked, not seeming sure of what he was talking about.\n\n“Yeah, we need to go. It's too late for Carter, but your mother is worried sick about you. Aunt Claire thinks you and your brother have been kidnapped, maybe even that the same person got you who got Henry. Let's go back,” he coaxed, “Let's go back before something happens.”\n\n“Something already happened,” Clint said, his voice husky, “Carter's gone, Henry's gone, and I'm tired of living with these dreams every night. They aren't going to stop until we all go in, and I'm tired of fighting it.”\n\n“What are you,” Daniel started, but Clint had stood and sprinted for the lip of the drop before we could stop him. Daniel made a grab for him but missed him completely. We both stepped after him, trying to catch him, but he was over the edge before we could even process what had happened. He didn't splash when he went in, just like Catherine hadn't, and Daniel and I stood there breathing heavily as we watched the still surface of The Blue.\n\nWhen he didn't surface, we walked back to the cabin with only the moon to guide us and called our parents.\n\nAs emergency services came out to dive into The Blue again, Daniel and I just sat there in shock.\n\n“We've got to get some distance from this,” Daniel said, “Maybe if we go where she can't find us, the dreams will stop and we can avoid the same fate that the others did.”\n\nI asked him if he believed that, and all he could say was it was worth a shot.\n\nThey sold the cabin after that. My Aunt Claire and Uncle Dale had lost both of their children in one night, and they took it pretty hard. Daniel and I helped each other through the next few years, but when Daniel graduated and said he was taking a job overseas, I could tell that the dreams were starting to get to him. I had kept my grades up, using the sleepless nights to study, and was eligible for early graduation. I had been accepted into a college three states away, something that broke my mother's heart, and Daniel wished me luck. \n\nFor the next three years, we just kind of maintained. The dreams got better with distance, and soon I stopped having them all together. Daniel told me the same and built a life for himself in South America. After three years, I almost forgot about the dreams and The Blue, just choking it up to something remembered wrong from childhood, and as I got closer and closer to graduating, I couldn't wait to start my new life.\n\nThen, Aunt Liz had died, and Uncle Mike had begged Daniel to come back.\n\nAunt Liz had died of a stroke in her bed, having left the facility years ago, and Uncle Mike was a mess. He had never really gotten over the loss of Henry, and he begged Daniel to come back and help him. Daniel had agreed to come back to help with the funeral preparations but then said he had to go back. He invited Uncle Mike to go back with him, saying he could stay with him in South America, but he doubted he would.\n\n“It's only for a couple of weeks, a month tops. I'll be fine,” he assured me.\n\nNow he was gone too.\n\nAs I sit here on the floor, typing this out, I can hear something I haven't in three years.\n\nThe Blue is calling again, Catherine is calling again, and I don't know how long I can hold out.\n\nSooner or later, I'll go join the rest of them.\n\nSooner or later, I'll return to The Blue.\n\nThe old guilt is still there, it's always been there, and I was a fool to think I could run from it.\n\nI should have saved myself the trouble and jumped the night Clint went in.\n\nNow I'm the last, and it's only a matter of time before Catherine gets me too."

        "selftext": "Investigation into the Duerius Case became my problem. I was unprepared, unqualified and too inexperienced for it, but that didn’t prevent the troubles from becoming my own. I had no choice but to accept the task of discovering the truth. \n\nI opened the file and noted that very little was established about the Duerius Case. There was a description of the mother and her child, a hospital report on the child’s toxicology, a copy of the note from the child’s teacher, signed by the school nurse and an official complaint from the social worker that had looked into the matter. I felt the first moment of creepiness before I made my first move. \n\nI picked up the phone on my desk and called the case worker. After the formalities I was told why there was an investigation: \n\n“It is my professional opinion that it is an actual incident of factitious disorder imposed on another.” The social worker explained. I pondered the meaning of the words for a moment before I responded: \n\n“Munchausen syndrome by proxy? Is that what you are describing? Are you implying that the mother is actually poisoning her kid?” I asked. I felt cold, despite the warmth of my office. \n\n“It is what I think. I’ve never seen such a thing before. It was a comment by the doctor that made me realize it is what must be occurring.” The voice of the case worker was serious and grave. \n\n“I understand. What did the doctor say, exactly?” I inquired. Making such an inquiry of someone is my specialty, as a special inquiries investigator. \n\n“The doctor said that the toxicology indicated a tolerance to the drug. That the symptoms have decreased and the dose increased over a considerable amount of time.” The case worker repeated the doctor’s concern. \n\n“Under what circumstances did the doctor make such a comment to you?” I asked without warning. The person I was speaking to hesitated and then revealed: \n\n“I was confided in by someone I am acquainted with, the doctor is a close friend. I believe the doctor and I made the case on behalf of the child.” The confession came. \n\n“You have no other connection to the Duerius case? There is no actual reason for a social worker to be involved.” I probed. \n\n“No. But it is the only conclusion. You have to investigate.” The social worker insisted. I thought for a couple of seconds before I said: \n\n“I can only proceed with this investigation if I am presented with evidence of an actual crime. Unfortunately, without the testimony of the doctor, I can do nothing.” I imposed. I knew that the social worker would give me the doctor’s name and number and so I waited until they decided that was their only option: \n\n“Then you will have to talk to the doctor.” The social worker concluded. \n\nI received the name and number of the doctor and called until I got through. \n\n“I was told by a mutual friend that you have useful information regarding the Duerius toxicology. I presume you were present and had concerns, prior to the results? Is that what made you ask a friend for help?” I asked. \n\n“It is. The toxicology report was inconclusive, but I have seen such a thing before. The results were consistent with a drug addiction, increased usage, tolerance and withdrawals. It is what I deal with all the time.” The doctor explained carefully. \n\n“I am afraid I don’t comprehend why you didn’t contact the police. What drug are we talking about?” I asked. \n\n“There was no actual evidence of any drug. Just the symptoms. The school had sent the child to the emergency room without parental consent. The parent, the mother, she couldn’t be reached. She only came and got her child later. She wanted no further treatment and she was angry that her child was in the hospital.” The doctor attempted to explain to me why they had done nothing except tell a social worker to make an official complaint. There was suspicion of child abuse. \n\n“That’s fine. Thanks for your time.” I told the doctor. \n\n“You will look into it though?” The doctor asked, concerned. \n\n“As long as there is evidence of a crime. This toxicology report, you said yourself, there’s no actual evidence of any drug.” I reminded the doctor. \n\n“Yes but...” The doctor protested. \n\n“What?” I asked, after the hesitation. \n\n“Please look into it. I am sure there is something wrong.” The doctor implored me. \n\n“I will do what I can.” I stated. There wasn’t anything I could do, at least nothing I could do in official capacity. I waited until the call was over and then I hung up. \n\nThen I called the school. The school nurse was available to speak to me over the phone and I had to remind them that I had a signature on the teacher’s note. \n\n“I don’t want to comment on it. The vice super intendant has told me that the school isn’t pressing charges and that the information is confidential. I can’t help you.” The school nurse sounded worried about themself, more than the case. \n\n“Can you tell me why you sent the child to the emergency room? I understand that you were unable to contact the parent prior to your decision.” I tried every access point to get them to speak. “Perhaps you can tell me how you felt about having to make such a decision?” \n\n“I felt scared.” The school nurse admitted reluctantly. \n\n“Why?” I asked. “Didn’t you feel confident that you were doing the right thing?” \n\n“No, I knew something was wrong.” The school nurse continued. \n\n“What made you so sure?” I asked. \n\n“I don’t think I am supposed to tell you.” I was told. I heard such words in almost every investigation. It always meant I was getting somewhere. \n\n“You don’t have to tell me.” I said, easing up with the quickness of my speech. Then I smiled a little bit and added casually: “But you do have the freedom to say anything you want. If you just want to say a few words, without answering my questions, I won’t put anything on the record.” \n\n“I was afraid that the child was getting worse. They had come into my office several times before, having strange symptoms. It was like the kid was doped, or something. I administered a drug test and it was inconclusive. The day I made the call, it was overwhelmingly obvious. I just didn’t know what else to do.” The school nurse said a few words off the record. I wasn’t satisfied. \n\n“I do have one more question, not regarding anything you just said.” I decided. \n\n“Okay, but I am not supposed to tell you anything.” The school nurse worried. \n\n“You can tell me whether or not you tried to call the parent.” I pointed out. “You don’t have to say why you might have skipped that step. Had you called her in the past?” \n\n“I never got through before, I always had to leave a message. The mother would get the recording and then she would come and get her kid. That day I only made one call.” The school nurse revealed to me with honesty. \n\n“Interesting.” I couldn’t help but say. I appreciated candor, it was like getting to take a breath of fresh air outside. \n\nI wasn’t able to reach the teacher, as the teacher had gotten ill and hadn’t come to school in over a week. I had to call the super intendant’s office and the information about the teacher was denied. I used the database I had access to and found out that there was a missing person report filed by the teacher’s neighbor. I called the local police department and was told they had not opened up an investigation yet. The police gave me the teacher’s phone number from the report. \n\nI called and got no answer. When I was unable to make contact with the teacher, I went to my supervisor and explained that there was a missing person report on a potential witness to an official complaint I was checking into. I told my supervisor that I felt suspicion that the case probably represented a crime, although I had not found any actual evidence. I was dispatched to visit the residence of my possible witness, under the circumstance that they seemed to be missing. \n\nThe flight I had to catch was early the next morning and I slept in my car in the parking garage of the airport. When I arrived, I accepted the rental and drove to the home of the school teacher. I got out and looked around. \n\nThe autumn leaves rustled all around me and there was a strange chill in the air that penetrated my warm clothes and made me shudder in anticipation of finding something unsettling. I had developed an instinct for knowing when I was actually following a criminal’s trail. I had never felt my instinct so strongly before that day. \n\nI looked around and noticed that the middle of the day had left the neighborhood more vacant than at night. Children were at school, people were at work, running errands or completely off guard. It was the most witching of hours, in broad daylight, except it was dark under hazy gray clouds. The cold air had everyone who was left indoors. Nobody was looking outside, they all had things to occupy them inside their homes. \n\nI walked with impunity up to the mailbox and confirmed that the mail was not being collected. I took that as enough proof for my own satisfaction that something was wrong. I went up to the front door and rang the bell and knocked and waited and repeated. There was no response. \n\nI tried the front door and found it locked. My next step was to walk around the house and examine all the entryways. There was no sign of any forced entry, but the back door was unlocked. I opened the door and called with my voice into the house. There was no response. \n\nI got out my cell phone and called the house and listened inside while it rang. There was no movement inside and nobody answered. I felt a kind of slow dread building up inside of me. \n\nEntering the house was my decision, despite the fact that it was a serious risk and that I was doing so without a warrant or permission. I could smell death from where I stood and I knew I would find a corpse. I went in and located the dead teacher. \n\nMy horror began, as I had never seen a homicide before. Not except at already established crime scenes, the body covered or in photographs. I drew my weapon from its holster and had it in one hand while my other hand covered my mouth with a handkerchief. \n\nShe was tied to the bedposts with items from around her house: a power cord, a curtain tassel, a dog leash and a belt. There was a head injury that had bled, leaving a trail to her body. Someone had hit her with a decorative vase. Whoever had attacked her had come unprepared, I presumed. \n\nThe front door was locked and had blood on it and so did the back door. The killer had tried to wash their hands in the bathroom. They had knocked her unconscious before tying her up. Then they had left her there, possibly alive. She had died where they had left her. I guessed that the head injury had resulted in her death. \n\nI called the police and explained to them what I was doing there, trying to contact her. I lied and said that I thought I had heard her respond to my voice from the back door, but that I was mistaken. The police questioned me no further and I waited while their forensics made a crime scene. \n\nWhile I sat there, I spotted a neighbor with a dog, watching the police. I got out of my car and walked over to them and asked them if they had filed a missing person report. I was told what I expected to hear, that the neighbor had indeed done so and that the dog had escaped from the open back door and wandered away. \n\n“You closed the back door?” I asked. The neighbor admitted that they had gone around the house and discovered the back door wide open. It was obviously how the dog had gotten out. I told them to keep the dog, for the teacher was deceased. \n\n“Was it murder?” I was asked by the neighbor. I gave no indication except to ask: \n\n“What makes you think that?” I asked. \n\n“There was a person I saw go in the front door. A woman, she looked suspicious, or at least I thought so.” The neighbor tried to explain. \n\n“You felt it was suspicious?” I asked. \n\n“It was just a feeling.”  \n\nI acquired a description, although vague. There was one detail that mattered: she was dropped off by someone who had left her there. I thanked the neighbor for cooperating and insisted that the dog be continuously cared for. They agreed to keep the dog and then I went and called my supervisor. \n\nWhen I explained that a visitor was dropped off and that my possible witness was dead: I was given the go ahead on pursuing the case as an active criminal investigation. I could only proceed further on the condition that I could establish a connection between the Duerius family and the teacher. I acknowledged the direction of the investigation. \n\nPaperwork was done on the case, back at the bureau, and I went to the police department and formally gained access to the forensics of the crime scene. There was a suspect warranted for an arrest, based on the fingerprints. It was not surprising to me that Mrs. Duerius was implicated. \n\nThe police arrested her on suspicion of murder. Before they took her, however, she had sent her child to stay with someone else. The police used her phone record to narrow down the possible accomplice to just one person she had exchanged calls with recently. I acquired the information on the person who had dropped her off and picked her up from the murder scene, although the police were slow to make any further arrests. \n\nWhen I was given access to Mrs. Duerius, I presented myself as a special investigator. \n\n“Do you know what I am doing here?” I asked her warmly. She shook her head and refused to speak. I offered her a clue: “It has to do with the school. I am investigating their response to your family’s privacy. It is illegal for them to disclose unqualified presumptions to social workers.” \n\n“They wouldn’t stay out of my business.” Mrs. Duerius said with anger. \n\n“I understand. Is that why you went to see your child’s teacher? To reason with her?” I asked. \n\nShe nodded. \n\n“I take it she wasn’t reasonable. She threatened you, told you it was her concern for her student?” I wondered. \n\n“I didn’t mean for it to happen.” Mrs. Duerius told me. \n\n“I believe you. But you couldn’t call for help, you were in too much trouble for accidentally hurting her.” I speculated. \n\n“I am trying to protect me family. She wanted to have my kid taken away.” Mrs. Duerius told me. \n\n“You did what any mother would do to protect her child.” I told her. “I plan to tell the prosecution that you only wanted to do the right thing. She is dead, but you didn’t mean it.” \n\nMrs. Duerius looked at me and stared, trying to determine if I could be trusted or not. I just stood there and waited for her to familiarize herself with my presence. Eventually she decided I was easier to talk to than the police, while I patiently waited and then, as she spoke, I just listened. \n\n“I just want to know if my child is safe.” She began. She hesitated, unsure if she should tell me more. I made no change in my expression nor did I ask her for more information. She slowly relaxed her guard and confided in me: “My brother took me there and came and got me. I sent my kid with him.” \n\nI nodded. I already knew what she was telling me, or at least it is what I had presumed. When I didn’t seem surprised or worried about interfering, she felt like she needed to explain herself anyway and said: \n\n“Going to talk to the teacher was his idea. He is really good with our kid, even though he has a problem. It’s really not his fault, none of it. Ever since my husband died, he’s become the only person I can rely on.” \n\nI wanted to ask for every kind of clarification. Instead, I just agreed with her by letting her tell me whatever she felt like saying. When someone wanted to explain themselves, it was because they felt like they were being listened to. Mrs. Duerius had a long story to tell and she would only tell it if she didn’t feel like divulging the details would compromise her, the brother or the kid. I asked with sympathy: \n\n“How were you able to get along when your husband died?” \n\n“It was hard. He died during a mugging. Someone killed him for his wallet. He never knew about what had happened between me and my brother. At least he never knew that.” Mrs. Duerius told me. \n\n“You mean your kid was also his?” I asked. She frowned and refused to answer. “It’s okay, a paternity test will be done during this investigation. I am just wondering if what happened wasn’t your brother’s fault?” \n\n“It was an accident.” Mrs. Duerius excused the incident she had in mind. I struggled not to squirm in my chair in the interrogation room. I felt very uncomfortable trying to add the new pieces to the puzzle. \n\n“Your husband never knew.” I confirmed. “And he was murdered by a stranger.” \n\n“Yes.” Mrs. Duerius agreed. She seemed to believe what she was saying. I nodded. \n\n“Is there anything else you want to tell me about your brother?” I asked. Then I added: “If he has some kind of problem, special considerations could be made for him. I think the police will arrest him for his connection to the teacher’s death.” \n\n“He does have a problem.” Mrs. Duerius added in his defense. She hesitated to say more and I just sat while she carefully chose her words. Then she elaborated for me: “He uses a medicine to deal with the nightmares he has always had. It makes him dream while he is awake, sometimes. He doesn’t always know what he is doing.” \n\n“What medicine?” I asked. “The hospital ran tests on your kid and found nothing. Could your kid have used the medicine?” \n\nMrs. Duerius started crying. She wanted to tell me everything. She felt like I understood her and sympathized with her. \n\n“Yes.” She sighed. When she was ready, she finally admitted everything. I sat calmly while I was filled with horror. Her kid had the same unbearable nightmares as her brother and she had started to administer the medicine that he used. It was not any drug that was known to science. They had a rare flower that had existed in their family for generations. They made the drug themselves and it was the only thing that kept the awfulness away. The nightmares were of something real and terrifying, something that could enter the world through the eyes of someone seeing it in nightmares. She couldn’t describe the monster and she could see that I couldn’t accept that what she was telling me was true. \n\nThe interview was over, she wanted to say no more about it. \n\nI looked into the police file for the murder of Mr. Duerius. I suspected it was no random killing, during a mugging. I believed she had no suspicions toward her brother. Neither the wallet, nor the murder weapon were discovered. He was killed by being stabbed twenty-eight times. Someone had made sure he died. No suspects were ever questioned or arrested. \n\nGetting him arrested took some time, a warrant had to be approved. He was under suspicion for the murder of Mr. Duerius. I arranged for the social worker to take the kid and also got a court order for a paternity test, which would serve as evidence in the form of motivation, if the results confirmed Mrs. Duerius’ statement to me. While I waited for the slow gears of justice to turn, I was confronted by nightmares of my own. \n\nI slept in a hotel room while I waited. I had taken some of the unknown drug into custodial evidence, from Mrs. Duerius’ home. When I fell asleep staring at the jar of ink: I dreamed of the monstrous things she had described. Utter horror gripped me and I awoke holding the jar. Something had overcome me and I had sampled the drug without realizing what I had done. \n\nAwareness of some tangible presence felt like fear of the dark. I was panicked and paralyzed by the nearby thing. I believed it had come from my eyes as I saw it, that it had come for me, finding me in my room alone. Terror gripped me as I found and held my firearm. \n\n“Who is there?” I asked. I slowly set the jar on the floor. \n\nI heard a low growling and smelled something like burnt carpet. I blinked in the darkness and could make out some shapeless shade, hulking there. It extended itself upwards and outwards towards me, reaching the ceiling corner and reaching for me. I fired two shots into it as I was overcome by fear. \n\nThe bullets hit something and it hissed and retracted. It squirted a glowing ichor onto the floor and then struck the window. When the glass shattered it slithered through to the outside. I just stood there panting for breath, unable to believe what I had encountered. Their nightmare thing was real, it had come to me as she had said. How I had taken a sip from the jar I could not remember. \n\nI staggered with shock into the bathroom and saw that it had left a dark stain on my lips. The sudden recollection of sitting in my bed and lifting it to my lips came to me. I had not chosen to drink it; something had compelled me to and I had fallen asleep and nearly forgotten what I had done. \n\nAs my breathing steadied, I accepted the horror and terror I had experienced. Whatever it was, there was surely an explanation for it. Despite my fear I went and took a sample of what it had bled when I shot it. I had to explain to the police that I was attacked in my hotel room. I did not surrender the substance because I did not believe the police would handle it any better than I had. They would not believe me that some unexplained nightmare thing had made me imbibe the medicine and dream it into existence. \n\nMr. Duerius’ killer turned out to be his brother-in-law. Forensic evidence implicated him and confronted with the motive: he confessed. I reported back to the bureau most of the details. My supervisor was worried that I wasn’t telling them everything. I had one last thing to do. \n\nI arrived, trembling, at the place where they had grown the black petalled flower, a lotus growing upon a compost of dead animals. I was afraid of whatever had gotten loose, worried that it was still at-large. I waited for it, despite my fears. As time went on, I became impatient. I set about to destroy the crop, the lab where they made it into the medicine and the artwork crafted and hoarded privately by generations of Duerius ancestors. \n\nShaking with dread, at the extremes to which I was going, I poured gasoline on all of it. Then, feeling watched from the night, I set fire to it. As it burned, I hoped the horrors would never return. When I left I realized I had acted rashly, but I was in the grip of morbid fear. Leaving to go home helped me to let go of me dread. \n\nI returned to my offices with the evidence of the creature’s existence: the sample of its blood. Analysis of the liquid matched nothing except the jar of inky medicine I had kept. Neither substance matched anything else, chemical or biological. I had reached a dead end."

        "selftext": "i almost got me, my brother, my friend kidnapped and possibly killed on the dark Web. hi my name is jake and I had this friend let's call him Yuki me and yuki were very close since we play call of duty all the time and one time while we were playing he asked me and my brother if we wanted to see something cool and we said yeah let's see it and he showed us an eyeball, a real eyeball not a fake one we were shocked and we asked where did you get this from and he started to open his VPN and showed us this website and he said this is the dark Web, it took a lot of time for it to load since the Internet at my place was crappy and after it loaded there was dozens of things I couldn't even imagine a human can do, there were execution links, torture links, selling organs links, and the links you wouldn't find these things on Google chrome or anywhere you search since these links are called onions, we started to go on a livestream of a guy getting his head decapitated and suddenly my brother didn't think twice and he took borrowed my friends computer and he commented on the live stream despite the warning of my friend \"you guys are monsters, stop this or I'm calling the cops\" and that decision was life altering, literally life altering since a lot of guys commented oh this guy next and the killer looked at the screen and said you three are next pointing to us, I think he can see us because the camera on the side was red and it means that it was on, my friend quickly covered it with ducktape we left the Web. After 30 minutes my friend my brother and I were pretty scared and were thinking to involve our parents here, and we got an email saying look at the window. and quick note that we my mom and dad went to hawaii for vacation and after my brother looking at the window he quickly got down as the window got shot by a shot gun and holy crap we were scared and at that point all that we could do is find a hiding spot, luckily for us we had a secret bunker at the basement that wouldn't be seen easily, the bunker contained a fan and snacks but we were too scared to even open the fan because he might hear us, we decided to leave our phones at the room so we couldn't be possibly traced. we never got out and we never took our hands of our mouths since they were searching the whole house and after i think it was 7:09 AM they left because they've been searching all night for us but the scary part was when the killer searched the basement before they left and was right on top of our bunker and we were scared for shit and my brother cried and after 10 minutes of searching the basement they left, after that we called the police and reported everything to them, luckily they were able to track the killer by the ip address of the onion link they posted on the Web and confesscated our phones, laptops, any device on the house and was restored so they can't track us anymore and they were arrested but after that day it gave me nightmares for 4 months and we moved to Dubai after 7 months after the incident I thought to myself what would've happened if we were found by the men, would our head would be cut off or we would receive much worse than the men tortured in the video."

        "selftext": "I’ve always been a little cautious about what I share online. I keep my profiles private, delete old posts, and only accept friend requests from people I genuinely know. So when a new friend request popped up one rainy Friday night, I glanced at it, fully prepared to ignore it.\n\nBut then I saw the name.\n\nDanielle.\n\nIt didn’t even register right away. I think my brain skipped a beat. I clicked the request, and her face came up—her *exact* face, smiling at me from her high school senior photo. I felt something icy creep up my spine. Danielle, my cousin, the cousin who had disappeared seventeen years ago. Danielle, who was officially declared dead nearly a decade ago. That Danielle.\n\nMy first instinct was to assume it was a scam. People create fake profiles all the time, and maybe some stranger had used her picture to friend random people. But why would anyone go to the trouble of creating a fake profile of a small-town girl who went missing years ago? Her disappearance hadn’t even been widely covered; just a handful of local papers, the kind of thing that fades into obscurity as the years pass.\n\nI sat there, staring at her profile photo. The longer I looked, the worse I felt. It was the same photo her mother kept on the wall in their living room—the one with her hair swept to one side, that crooked smile that always made her look like she was up to something. Danielle’s freckles were still visible even in the grainy profile pic, a detail only someone who knew her would remember.\n\nI don’t know what made me do it, but I accepted the request. My hands were shaking as I clicked it, feeling like I’d just invited something into my life that I couldn’t take back. Immediately, I got a message notification.\n\nHey, Josh! Long time no see :)\n\nI stared at the screen. The message felt so casual, so *normal*, that it was disturbing. I could practically hear her voice in my head, bright and cheerful like it used to be. My fingers trembled as I typed back.\n\nWho is this?\n\nThe typing bubbles appeared immediately, as though the sender had been waiting for my response. I waited, each second stretching out endlessly until the reply appeared.\n\nCome on, it’s me, Dani. I missed you!\n\nNo one had called her \"Dani\" since she disappeared. That nickname was something only a few people used: me, my mom, maybe her old friends back home. Reading it felt like someone had reached into my chest and squeezed my heart. It was impossible, and yet…\n\nI didn’t know what to say. Part of me wanted to block the account, delete the message, and pretend this never happened. But another part of me, some deep, morbid curiosity, couldn’t let it go. I typed back slowly, each letter feeling heavier than the last.\n\nDanielle’s dead.\n\nMy breath was shallow as I waited for the reply, unsure if I even *wanted* one. The typing bubbles returned almost instantly, and my pulse quickened. This was someone’s sick joke, and I was falling for it.\n\nWhat do you mean, dead? I’ve just been… away. Come meet me, and I’ll explain everything.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. Meet her? Who would *want* to meet someone pretending to be a long-lost relative, especially someone pretending to be Danielle? But curiosity—painful, aching curiosity—tugged at me. Where was this person going with this?\n\nWhere?\n\nThe answer came faster than I expected:\n\nThe place where we found that old journal.\n\nAnd that’s when the memories rushed back. I hadn’t thought about that cabin in years. It was this crumbling shack on my grandparents’ property, just a mile or so into the woods. Danielle had found it one summer when we were kids, and it became our secret hideaway. We’d spent hours digging through the junk left behind, looking for “treasures.” Danielle loved the place, always convincing me to go back even when it creeped me out. One day, she found an old, rotting leather journal in a drawer. She spent days reading through it, obsessed with its strange, cryptic writing, even as the pages crumbled in her hands.\n\nBut nobody else knew about the cabin. Nobody except me, and Danielle.\n\nThe room felt colder, the hum of my laptop loud in the silence. I wanted to dismiss it as a coincidence or a twisted prank, but deep down, I knew that no one could fake this. I didn’t sleep at all that night, the message burning a hole in my mind. I found myself remembering things I hadn’t thought about in years: the way Danielle had looked back at me that last day I saw her, the half-smile she gave me before driving away.\n\nIn the morning, I made up my mind. I was going to the cabin.\n\nThe drive to my grandparents' old property was hauntingly familiar, the same cracked roads, dense woods on either side. They’d sold the place years ago, but the new owners hadn’t done much with the land, so I didn’t think anyone would notice me there. By the time I reached the path leading to the cabin, the sun was beginning to set, casting the trees in a rusty, orange glow.\n\nI could hardly breathe as I made my way through the woods. Every step felt like a countdown, each crunch of the leaves beneath my feet drawing me closer to something I didn’t fully understand. When I finally saw the cabin, it looked just as decrepit as I remembered, almost swallowed by ivy and twisted branches. I hadn’t been there in years, but I’d never forgotten it.\n\nThe door was already open. I took a shaky breath and stepped inside.\n\nThe smell hit me first, a familiar mix of mildew and rot that seemed to cling to every surface. The cabin was exactly how I remembered it, like some haunted snapshot of my childhood memories. Dust motes floated through the air, catching the last light of day filtering through the cracks in the walls.\n\nAnd then I saw her.\n\nDanielle was standing in the back corner of the room, half-hidden in shadow. She was exactly the same. Her auburn hair was tangled, her clothes looked faded and worn, like she’d stepped out of some forgotten time capsule. Her face was pale, but unmistakably hers—frozen at twenty, just as she’d been the last time I saw her.\n\nI opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. She watched me, her eyes soft and sad, her expression almost… expectant.\n\n“Danielle?” I whispered, my voice barely audible.\n\nShe smiled, that same crooked smile I’d missed for so long. “Hey, Josh.”\n\nI took a step back, instinctively, as if to shield myself. But she didn’t move. She just kept watching me, her gaze steady, unwavering.\n\n“You—you’re not real,” I stammered. “Danielle’s dead. You can’t be here.”\n\nHer face softened, almost like she pitied me. “Why would you think that? I’m right here.”\n\nHer words didn’t make sense. She *wasn’t* right here. This wasn’t her, it *couldn’t* be her. But something deep inside me wanted so desperately to believe it, to believe that she’d somehow come back to me, that she hadn’t really been gone.\n\n“Where have you been?” I finally managed, my voice shaky.\n\nShe tilted her head, as if the question confused her. “I was just… away. But I came back for you, Josh. I missed you.”\n\nThe emptiness in her eyes chilled me. There was no warmth, no life, just… absence. Like a doll with Danielle’s face, her movements stiff and unnatural.\n\n“I don’t understand,” I whispered, taking another step back. “You… disappeared. You never came home. They found your car, but—”\n\n“I was always here,” she said, cutting me off. Her voice was calm, almost eerie in its detachment. “But you weren’t looking in the right place.”\n\nI felt like I was slipping, like reality was splintering around me. Nothing made sense, but she was standing right there, as real as I was.\n\n“Why are you here?” I asked, barely able to hold her gaze. “Why now?”\n\nHer smile faded, and for the first time, I saw something close to sadness in her eyes. “I didn’t want you to forget me. I only exist because you remember me, Josh.”\n\nThe room felt colder, the shadows lengthening as her words settled into my bones. She took a step closer, her hand reaching out, and I instinctively backed away.\n\n“You promised, remember?” she whispered, her voice so soft it was barely audible. “You said you’d never leave me alone. You said we’d always be together.”\n\nI remembered that promise. We’d been young, and I’d said it in the way kids do, not realizing the weight of the words. But she had remembered. Somehow, she had held me to it.\n\n“You have to let go,” I said, my voice breaking. “You have to move on.”\n\nHer face twisted, her expression darkening. “I don’t *want* to move on. I don’t exist anywhere else, Josh. I exist *because of you.*”\n\nThe desperation in her voice was like a physical force, pressing against me, trapping me. Her hand reached out again, and this time I couldn’t move. Her fingers were cold, like ice, as they wrapped around my wrist, and I felt a pull, like she was trying to drag me somewhere I didn’t want to go.\n\n“I came back for you,” she whispered, her voice a twisted echo. “You promised. Don’t leave me alone.”\n\nI wrenched my arm free, stumbling backward, my heart racing. I turned and ran out of the cabin, my feet pounding against the ground as I bolted through the woods, the shadows closing in around me. I didn’t stop until I reached my car, gasping for breath, my hands shaking so badly I could barely get the key into the ignition.\n\nAs I drove away, I looked back once, catching a glimpse of her standing in the doorway, her figure swallowed by darkness. She watched me leave, her expression unreadable, and I felt a pang of guilt, like I was abandoning her all over again.\n\nWhen I finally got home, I was exhausted, yet too wired to sleep. I felt her presence in every shadow of my room, lingering just out of sight. I kept expecting to see her face if I looked into the mirror too long, or worse, to feel her icy touch again. I deleted her friend request, blocked the account, and went so far as to deactivate my entire Facebook profile, thinking that maybe, somehow, this would sever whatever strange connection I’d felt with her that night.\n\nBut nothing changed.\n\nThe next few days passed in a blur, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. At night, I’d wake up to creaking sounds around the house, or I’d catch faint whiffs of her favorite perfume—the faint, lavender scent Danielle always wore. It filled my head like a memory that wasn’t supposed to be there.\n\nAnd then, a few nights later, I noticed my phone vibrating in the dark. I squinted at the screen, barely able to make out the time—it was 3:17 a.m.—and a message notification appeared.\n\nI didn’t recognize the number, but when I opened the message, my stomach lurched.\n\nWhy did you leave? You promised you wouldn’t leave me alone.\n\nI stared at the screen, my heart hammering in my chest. I double-checked that I’d blocked her account. It wasn’t possible; I’d cut off all contact, deleted everything, even her number from my phone all those years ago. This number wasn’t in my contacts. But the messages kept coming.\n\nDon’t you remember our promise, Josh? You said we’d always be together. You said you’d be back.\n\nI didn’t reply. I didn’t dare. I turned my phone off, hoping it would stop, but the next morning, when I turned it back on, the messages were there, waiting for me.\n\nThe next night, they came through again. The same words, over and over, filling up my screen:\n\nWhy did you leave me?\n\nThe messages grew more desperate, more accusing, each one digging deeper under my skin. I deleted them, blocked the number, even changed my phone number. I couldn’t stand it, couldn’t understand how this was happening. But no matter what I did, each night, they found a way back.\n\nOne night, I was sitting alone, trying to distract myself, when a memory surfaced—something I hadn’t thought about in years. The last time I saw Danielle, just before she got in her car, she’d pulled me into a hug and whispered, “We’ll always be together, right?”\n\nI’d laughed it off back then. I was only twelve, but I remembered how serious she’d looked, the way her eyes had searched mine, as if she was waiting for an answer. I’d just nodded, grinning, and said, “Of course, Dani.”\n\nNow, it felt like those words were etched into my skin.\n\nI tried telling myself it was all in my head, that I was imagining things, but the messages kept coming. They would appear from random numbers, even after I’d blocked them all. Sometimes I’d hear her voice in the dead silence of the night, just a faint whisper, like the sound of her laughter drifting on the wind. It was real enough that I’d bolt up in bed, my heart racing, my skin crawling.\n\nFinally, I decided to talk to my mom. I didn’t tell her everything, just that I’d had some “weird messages” and that they were bringing up memories I’d tried to bury. She listened, her face tight with worry, and then, in the quietest voice, she said, “I still dream about her, too.”\n\nHer words hit me like a punch to the gut. She paused, wringing her hands, staring down at them like she was ashamed.\n\n“I know it sounds crazy,” she murmured, “but some nights, it feels like she’s here. I’ve even heard her voice a few times, calling out. I thought… I thought it was just grief.”\n\nI didn’t tell her about the messages, didn’t tell her about the night at the cabin. She wouldn’t believe me—or worse, she *would*. I just nodded, feeling a chill creep over me.\n\nWe sat in silence for a long while, the quiet stretching between us. Finally, I left, feeling heavier than ever. I went home, locked the doors, and sat awake, my ears tuned to every creak and whisper.\n\nThat night, just as I was drifting off, my phone buzzed again. It was a new message from an unknown number.\n\nCome back, Josh.\n\nSomething snapped in me, some buried instinct that had been fighting this for days. I turned my phone off, threw it across the room, and pulled the covers over my head like I was a kid again, scared of the dark.\n\nI thought I could ignore her, but I was wrong.\n\nThe next morning, there was a message waiting for me, the screen lit up before I’d even picked it up.\n\nI’ll be waiting.\n\nIt was the last message I received, but it’s haunted me every night since. I moved away, tried to start fresh, but no matter where I go, I still feel her. In the shadows, in the corners of my mind, her memory clings to me like a weight I can’t escape.\n\nSometimes, when the nights are quiet, I hear her whispering.\n\nAnd every now and then, when I least expect it, my phone will buzz with a notification from an unknown number—no message, just the reminder that she’s still there, waiting.\n\nAnd I know, deep down, that one day, I’ll have to go back."

        "selftext": "I stood alone on the deck of the research vessel \"Nautilus,\" gazing out at the vast, unending Pacific Ocean. \n\nThe horizon stretched endlessly in every direction, a seemingly infinite expanse of deep blue that reflected the sky's shifting moods. \n\nThe gentle sway of the ship beneath my feet was a minor comfort against the storm of emotions churning within me. Excitement, anticipation, and a whisper of fear mingled together, creating a sensation I had never quite felt before. \n\nMy heart raced in rhythm with the waves, each beat a reminder of the monumental journey I was about to undertake.\n\nToday was the day I had dreamed of for years—a chance to dive into the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans. As a marine biologist, this moment was the culmination of my life's work and preparation. \n\nThe countless hours spent studying, the rigorous training, and the meticulous planning had all led to this singular point in time. I would be descending over 36,000 feet into a world that remained mostly unknown to humanity, a place where the pressure is so immense that it crushes almost everything in its grasp, and the darkness is so absolute that even the faintest light struggles to penetrate.\n\nThis dive was more than just a scientific expedition; it was an exploration into the very heart of the Earth's mysteries. \n\nWhat secrets did the Mariana Trench hold? \n\nWhat lifeforms had adapted to survive in such an extreme environment, where the laws of nature seemed to be rewritten? \n\nThese questions had haunted my thoughts for as long as I could remember, driving me forward even when the challenges seemed insurmountable.\n\nThe ocean breeze tousled my hair as I stood there, lost in contemplation. \n\nI knew that the descent would not be easy. \n\nThe journey into the unknown was fraught with risks, from the immense pressures that could crush the submersible to the unpredictable nature of the deep-sea environment. \n\nBut these dangers only fueled my determination. \n\nThe fear was real, but it was tempered by the thrill of discovery, the knowledge that I was on the brink of witnessing something no one else had ever seen.\n\nAs I took a deep breath, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. The fear, the anticipation, the excitement—they were all part of the experience, a reminder that I was about to step into a world few had ever dared to explore. \n\nThe dive into the Mariana Trench was not just a journey into the depths of the ocean; it was a journey into the depths of my own resolve, my own desire to push the boundaries of what we know about our planet. \n\nAnd as the preparations for the dive continued around me, I knew that I was ready to face whatever awaited me in the darkness below.\n\nMy training had been grueling. I had spent months preparing for this mission, including mastering emergency protocols and learning to operate the intricate systems of the submersible alone. \n\nI endured countless hours in a hyperbaric chamber, acclimating my body to the crushing pressures of the deep sea. \n\nPhysical conditioning, mental fortitude exercises, and meticulous simulations had all led to this moment. \n\nDespite the training, a part of me remained apprehensive. \n\nThe immense pressure down there could be fatal, and the isolation was profound. But the allure of discovering new species and contributing to our understanding of Earth's final frontier made every risk worth it.\n\nThe submersible, \"Deep Explorer\", was an work of engineering, designed for a solo journey into the abyss. \n\nIts sleek, elongated teardrop shape was built to endure the enormous pressures of the deep sea. The titanium hull was reinforced with layers of composite materials, and it was equipped with high-definition cameras, robotic arms for collecting samples, and a suite of scientific instruments. The interior was compact, designed to accommodate me and the essential equipment. With just enough space to operate the controls and conduct my research, it was both a marvel of engineering and a tight squeeze.\n\nAs I donned my thermal gear, designed to protect me from the freezing temperatures of the deep, a rush of adrenaline surged through me. \n\nThe crew worked with practiced precision, performing last-minute checks and securing the submersible. With a final nod to the team, I climbed into the submersible and sealed the hatch behind me. The cabin lit up with the soft glow of the control panels, and a low hum filled the space as the systems activated.\n\nWith a final nod to the team, I climbed into the submersible and sealed the hatch behind me, the sound of the outer world muffling into silence. \n\nThe cabin lit up with the soft glow of the control panels, each light representing a different system coming online. The low hum of the engines filled the space, a steady reminder of the power and technology that would carry me into the depths. \n\nI adjusted my seat, double-checked the instrument readouts, and took a deep breath, trying to quell the mixture of excitement and anxiety bubbling inside me.\n\nThe final command was given, and the \"Deep Explorer\" was lowered into the water. \n\nThe transition from air to water was seamless, the submersible gliding smoothly beneath the surface. As the surface above quickly receded, I felt a growing sense of claustrophobia take hold.. The once-bright sky faded from view, replaced by the inky blackness of the ocean's depths.\n\nInitially, the descent was through the epipelagic zone, where sunlight still penetrated, casting the water in hues of blue and green. Fish darted around the submersible, their scales catching the light in flashes of silver. The water was alive with motion, teeming with life in a vibrant aquatic dance. But soon, the sunlight began to weaken, the bright rays filtering down in delicate, shimmering beams that grew fainter with every passing meter.\n\nAs I continued downward, the mesopelagic zone—the twilight zone—enveloped me. Here, the light was dim and eerie, a perpetual dusk where the outlines of creatures became shadowy, and bioluminescence began to dominate the scene. The submersible's lights revealed schools of fish with glowing bodies and eyes like lanterns, creatures adapted to the eternal twilight of this realm. The temperature dropped noticeably, and the pressure began to increase, causing the hull to creak softly.\n\nFurther down, I entered the bathypelagic zone—the midnight zone. All traces of natural light were gone, replaced by an all-consuming darkness that pressed in from every direction. The submersible's floodlights cut through the blackness, revealing strange, ghostly creatures that seemed more alien than earthly. Giant squid, translucent jellyfish, and other bizarre life forms drifted by, their movements slow and deliberate, as if conserving energy in the cold, oxygen-starved waters.\n\nFinally, the abyssal zone came into view. \n\nThe darkness here was absolute, a void that seemed to swallow the light entirely. The pressure was immense, almost crushing, a force that could obliterate any vessel not specifically designed to withstand it. The water was near freezing, a hostile environment where only the hardiest of life forms could survive. It was in this foreboding realm that the \"Deep Explorer\" would continue its journey, deeper still, into the unknown.\n\n«Entering the abyssal zone,» I murmured to myself, trying to steady my nerves. «All systems normal.»\n\nMy heart pounded as I descended further into the Mariana Trench. \n\nThe pressure outside was immense, and the depth was overwhelming. The trench itself is a colossal underwater canyon stretching over 1,550 miles long and 45 miles wide, plunging nearly seven miles deep. Here, the pressure is over a thousand times greater than at sea level, and the temperature hovers just above freezing. It's a realm of perpetual darkness, where only the most resilient creatures can survive.\n\nAs the \"Deep Explorer\" continued its journey, the world above seemed a distant memory. \n\nEach moment brought me closer to the profound, unknown depths of the Mariana Trench. Alone in the submersible, I felt like an intruder in this alien world, yet the thrill of discovery pushed me forward. This was my dream realized, and the mysteries of the deep awaited.\n\nThe descent continued, and as I passed the abyssal zone, the darkness deepened, and the pressure increased. I had been alone in the Deep Explorer for hours, the only sounds were the steady hum of the submersible's systems and my own breathing, amplified by the tight confines of the cabin. \n\nI focused on maintaining calm, though my heartbeat was a steady drumbeat against the silence.\n\nPhysically, the pressure was starting to make its presence known. I could feel a slight, almost imperceptible tension in my chest, a reminder of the 1,000 times atmospheric pressure pressing down on me. My muscles ached from the prolonged stillness, and the cold was penetrating, despite the thermal gear. The temperature inside the submersible was regulated, but the cold seeped through in subtle ways. Every now and then, I shifted in my seat, trying to alleviate the stiffness, but the confined space left little room for movement.\n\nMentally, the isolation was the greatest challenge. The darkness outside was complete, a vast, impenetrable void that seemed to stretch on forever. My only connection to the world outside was the faint glow of the submersible's instruments and the occasional flicker of bioluminescent creatures passing by. I forced myself to focus on the task at hand, the scientific mission that had driven me to undertake this expedition.\n\nAs I descended further, a brief crackle of static over the comms signaled the inevitable—the connection to the surface was lost. \n\nI had anticipated this moment, knowing that the extreme depth and crushing pressure would eventually sever the fragile link. The electromagnetic signals that enabled communication struggled to penetrate the dense layers of water and rock. \n\nThe deeper I went, the more the signal deteriorated, until finally, it could no longer reach the surface.\n\nThis was no cause for alarm, though; it was an expected consequence of venturing into one of the most remote and hostile environments on Earth. The Deep Explorer was equipped with advanced autonomous systems designed to handle such isolation. It could record data, navigate, and operate its instruments without external input, relying on its pre-programmed directives and my manual control.\n\nYet, despite the advanced technology, the loss of connection was a stark reminder of how truly alone I was. There was no longer a tether to the world above—no way to call for help, no reassurance from the crew. I was entirely on my own in this pitch-black void, relying solely on the integrity of the submersible and my own skills to complete the mission and return safely to the surface.\n\nThe Deep Explorer was holding up well. Designed to withstand the immense pressures of the hadal zone. \n\nThe control panels were alive with data, and the floodlights cast a stark contrast against the encroaching darkness. The sub's robust titanium hull, reinforced with layers of advanced composites, ensured that I remained safe.\n\nPassing through the hadal zone was like entering another world entirely. The hadal zone is characterized by extreme pressure, near-freezing temperatures, and complete darkness. The submersible's advanced sonar systems painted a picture of the surrounding terrain, revealing towering underwater mountains and deep ravines. It was a landscape of harsh beauty, sculpted by forces beyond human comprehension.\n\nAs I approached the ocean floor, the anticipation was palpable. \n\nMy eyes were fixed on the monitors, eagerly awaiting the first glimpses of the trench's floor. The pressure outside was immense, but the submersible's integrity was holding strong. I had prepared for this, but the reality of reaching the deepest part of the ocean was both thrilling and daunting.\n\nFinally, the submersible touched down on the floor of the Mariana Trench, ending what had felt like an eternal descent into the abyss.\n\nThe descent was complete.\n\nAs I settled onto the floor of the Mariana Trench, the enormity of the moment began to sink in. The darkness was absolute, an almost tactile presence pressing in from every direction. The only source of illumination was the submersible's floodlights, slicing through the murk to reveal the barren, alien landscape that stretched out before me.\n\nA profound sense of solitude enveloped me, more intense than anything I had ever experienced. \n\nIt was as if I had journeyed to the edge of the world, where no light from the sun could reach, and no other human had dared to venture. The silence was deafening, broken only by the occasional creak of the submersible's hull adjusting to the immense pressure. In that moment, I realized just how isolated I truly was—miles beneath the surface, with nothing but the cold, crushing deep surrounding me. The weight of the ocean pressed down not just on the submersible but on my very soul, a reminder that I was a lone explorer in a place few had ever seen.\n\nThe landscape was otherworldly, a stark contrast to the vibrant marine environments I had explored in the past. \n\nThe seabed was a mix of fine sediment and jagged rock formations, sculpted by the unimaginable pressures of the deep. Towering pillars of basalt rose from the floor, their surfaces encrusted with strange, translucent creatures that pulsed with an eerie bioluminescence. \n\nThe terrain was dotted with hydrothermal vents, spewing superheated water and minerals into the frigid water, creating plumes that shimmered in the floodlights. Around these vents, life thrived in ways that defied the harsh conditions—tube worms, shrimp, and other exotic organisms that seemed more at home in a science fiction novel than on Earth.\n\nI took a deep breath, reminding myself of the extensive training that had prepared me for this moment. \n\nThe robotic arms of the Deep Explorer were nimble and precise, allowing me to collect sediment and biological samples with ease. The seabed around me was a surreal landscape of alien formations and strange, glowing organisms. The samples I gathered felt like a triumph—each one a key to unlocking the secrets of this remote part of the ocean.\n\nFor a while, everything seemed to proceed normally. The bioluminescent creatures danced in the submersible's floodlights, their ethereal glow providing a mesmerizing view of the trench's ecosystem. I carefully maneuvered the submersible to capture these creatures and collect sediment samples from the ocean floor. The data was consistent, the samples were intact, and the mission was going according to plan.\n\nThen, something changed.\n\nI noticed a shift in the behavior of the creatures around me. The once-active bioluminescent jellyfish and deep-sea fish suddenly vanished into the darkness. \n\nAn uneasy stillness settled over the trench floor. My pulse quickened as I scanned the area, trying to understand the sudden change.\n\nI strained to see beyond the reach of the submersible's lights, but the darkness was impenetrable. \n\nThe floodlights illuminated only a small, controlled area, leaving the vast majority of the trench cloaked in shadows. \n\nThat's when I saw it—movement in the darkness. \n\nIt was elusive, just beyond the light's reach, but unmistakable. The sand on the ocean floor began to shift, disturbed by something unseen. And then, the legs emerged—long, segmented, crab-like appendages that seemed to belong to a creature far larger than anything I had anticipated.\n\nAs I adjusted the controls, the submersible's lights swept across the area, and I caught more glimpses of these legs moving through the sand. \n\nThe sounds of scraping and shifting sediment grew louder, and I realized that multiple creatures were moving around me. The legs moved with an eerie grace, and every so often, I would catch a fleeting view of one of these beings passing through the gloom.\n\nOne of the creatures drew closer, coming within the periphery of the submersible's lights. It was still too far for a detailed view, but it was clear that this was no ordinary crab. The appendages were enormous—much larger than the so-called \"Big Daddy,\" the largest crab known to science. \n\nMy heart raced with a mix of fear and excitement. Could I have discovered a new, colossal species of crab?\n\nDetermined to document my findings, I activated the submersible's high-definition cameras and focused them on the area of activity. The images on the monitor were grainy and unclear, but they captured the shadowy forms and the massive legs moving through the sand. \n\nThe idea of having found the largest crab ever recorded filled me with excitement.\n\nBut as the creature drew closer, a sense of unease began to overshadow  that initial thrill. The movement was not just large—it was deliberate and methodical, as if the creatures were deliberately surrounding me. \n\nMy training had prepared me for many scenarios, but I had never anticipated encountering a potential swarm of massive, unknown creatures.\n\nThe submersible's instruments began to register fluctuations, and the sediment around me seemed to churn more violently. I noticed that the creatures were not just moving—they were converging, as if drawn to the submersible's presence. \n\nThe sense of being watched grew stronger, and a chill ran down my spine despite the warmth inside the cabin.\n\nBut then, silence descended like a heavy curtain, and the darkness around me seemed to swallow even the faint glow of the submersible's instruments. I waited, my senses heightened, searching for any sign of the giant crabs, but nothing moved, no sound, no glimpse. \n\nThe sand around remained still, as if the aquatic life had been repelled.\n\nThen, a subtle sound emerged from the side of the submersible, a sort of light tapping, as if something was exploring the metal walls with curiosity. I quickly turned, my eyes fixed on the metal surfaces that formed the cabin's shield. \n\nWhat could be on the other side? \n\nThe ensuing silence seemed to challenge me to find out.\n\nSuddenly, a loud bang shook the submersible. \n\nThe window glass rattled and I nearly jumped out of my seat, my heart pounding. With instinctive speed, I whipped around to face the source of the noise, my eyes locking onto the main viewing port.\n\nTo my horror, I saw that something had slammed into the thick glass, leaving a web of crackling marks etched across its surface. The jagged lines spread like fractures in ice, distorting the murky darkness outside\n\nA cold sweat broke out across my skin as the terrifying reality sank in—if that glass hadn't held, the submersible would have imploded under the crushing pressure of the deep. In the blink of an eye, I would have been obliterated, killed in less than a second, with no chance to even comprehend what had happened. \n\nThe pressure down here was so immense that the slightest breach would have meant instant death, my body crushed and flattened like an empty can underfoot.\n\nI forced myself to steady my breathing, trying to make sense of the chaos outside. Through the murky darkness, I could see shadows moving with a disturbing, unnatural grace. My mind raced as I tried to identify the source of the threat. \n\nI stared in horror, my voice barely a whisper as the words escaped me: «What in God's name are those things?»\n\nThe creatures I had initially thought were crabs revealed their true nature as they drew closer. \n\nThey were not mere crustaceans; they were towering, nightmarish humanoids with multiple legs that moved more like giant, predatory spiders than crabs. \n\nTheir bodies were elongated and gaunt, standing at an unsettling height that made them all the more menacing. Draped in nearly translucent, sickly skin that glowed with a ghastly, otherworldly light, they looked like twisted remnants of some forgotten world. Their torsos and waists were unnaturally thin, while their long, spindly arms extended forward like elongated, skeletal claws, ready to ensnare anything that crossed their path.\n\nAs the creatures drew closer, I noticed another unsettling aspect of their appearance. From their spindly arms and along their gaunt backs sprouted membranous appendages, resembling the delicate fronds of deep-sea algae. \n\nThese appendages undulated and drifted with their movements, almost as if they were alive, giving the impression that the creatures were part of the ocean itself. The algae-like strands were thin and sinewy, some stretching long and flowing like tattered banners in the current, while others clung to their bodies like decayed fins. \n\nThe effect was eerie, as if these beings had adapted perfectly to their dark, aquatic environment, merging with the deep-sea flora to become one with the abyssal world around them.\n\nThese appendages added to their grotesque appearance, making them seem even more alien and otherworldly. It was as if the creatures had evolved to blend into their surroundings, their bodies designed to navigate and hunt in the inky darkness of the trench. \n\nThe sight of these algae-like membranes, shifting and pulsating with each movement, made them appear almost spectral—ghosts of the deep, haunting the dark waters with their unnerving presence.\n\nSome of these horrifying beings were wielding crude, menacing spears, crafted from what appeared to be bone or a dark, coral-like material. The spears were jagged and barbed, adding to the grotesque aura of the creatures. \n\nTheir heads were shrouded in darkness, but I could make out a pair of eerie, pulsating orbs where their eyes should be, casting a malevolent, greenish glow that seemed to pierce through the gloom.\n\nAs they drew nearer, the creatures began to emit low, guttural sounds—an eerie mixture of clicks, hisses, and what almost sounded like a distorted, unnatural whisper. It was a chilling noise that seemed to resonate within the submersible, making the very air vibrate with an otherworldly hum. \n\nAt first, I assumed these sounds were just mindless animalistic noises, a natural consequence of whatever twisted physiology these beings possessed. But as I listened more closely, I began to realize there was a rhythm to the sounds, an almost deliberate cadence that suggested they were not just noises, but a form of communication. \n\nThe clicks were sharp and rapid, like the tapping of claws on glass, while the hisses came in slow, deliberate bursts. The whispers were the most disturbing of all—soft, breathy sounds that almost seemed to form words, though in a language I couldn't begin to understand.\n\nThe noise sent a shiver down my spine, heightening the sense of dread that had taken hold of me. \n\nIt was as if the creatures were communicating, coordinating their movements, or perhaps even discussing me, the intruder in their world. \n\nThe thought that they might possess some form of intelligence, that they were not just mindless predators but beings with a purpose, filled me with a new kind of terror.\n\nAs I observed them, it became evident that the loud bang I had heard moments earlier was the result of one of these spears striking the glass of the submersible. The sight of the menacing creatures and the damage to the glass intensified my fear, underscoring the growing danger they represented.\n\nThe creatures advanced slowly, their spider-like legs moving with a deliberate, almost predatory grace. \n\nThey pointed their crude, jagged spears directly at me, their eerie, pulsating eyes glinting with malevolent intent.  \n\nAs they closed in, a low, guttural sound emanated from deep within their throats—a noise so alien and foreboding that it resonated through the walls of the submersible, making the very air seem to vibrate with dread\n\nPanic surged through me, and for a moment, I was utterly lost. \n\nThe realization that I was completely alone, with no way to call for help, hit me like a wave of icy water. The communication link with the surface had been severed as expected upon reaching these depths, but the finality of it now felt crushing. \n\nI had always believed I was prepared for anything this expedition might throw at me, even death if it came to that. Yet now, face-to-face with these monstrous beings, I realized how desperately unready I was. \n\nMy mind raced, but no solutions presented themselves, only the terrifying certainty that there was nothing I could do to stop them.\n\nMy entire body was gripped by a paralyzing fear. \n\nThe submersible, designed for scientific exploration and equipped with only basic instrumentation, was utterly defenseless against such a threat. \n\nMy hands shook uncontrollably, and in my panic, I accidentally brushed against the control panel.\n\nTo my surprise, the robotic arm of the submersible jerked into motion. The sudden movement caused the creatures to flinch and scatter, retreating into the dark waters from which they had emerged. \n\nAs they backed away, the eerie sounds they had been emitting shifted, becoming more frantic, the rhythm faster and more chaotic. It was as if they were warning each other, or perhaps expressing fear for the first time. \n\nThe quick reaction of the robotic arm had inadvertently frightened them, giving me a precious moment of reprieve.\n\nSeizing this unexpected opportunity, I scrambled to initiate the emergency ascent. My fingers fumbled with the controls as I engaged the ascent protocol, the submersible's engines groaning to life with a deep, resonant hum. The submersible shuddered and began its rapid climb towards the surface. \n\nEach second felt like an eternity as I watched the dark, foreboding depths recede behind me.\n\nThe terror of the encounter was still fresh, lingering in the back of my mind like a shadow that refused to dissipate. \n\nMy thoughts spiraled uncontrollably as I imagined the countless ways the situation could have ended if the robotic arm hadn't jerked to life at that critical moment. \n\nI could vividly picture the glass shattering under the relentless assault of those monstrous beings, the submersible imploding under the crushing pressure of the deep, and my body being torn apart in an instant—an unrecognizable fragment lost to the abyss. \n\nAs the submersible accelerated upward, every creak and groan of the hull seemed amplified, each one a reminder of how perilously close I had come to disaster. \n\nMy heart pounded in my chest, and with every passing second, I found myself glancing back into the dark void, fearing that the creatures might regroup, their malevolent eyes locked onto me, and launch a final, relentless pursuit. \n\nThe rush to safety was a desperate, frantic bid to outrun the nightmare that had emerged from the depths, a horror so profound that even the vastness of the ocean seemed small in comparison.\n\nYet, amidst the overwhelming fear, another thought gnawed at me—an unsettling realization that I had encountered something more than just terrifying monsters. \n\nThese beings, grotesque as they were, had exhibited signs of intelligence. \n\nThe way they wielded their weapons, their coordinated movements, and even the eerie sounds they emitted suggested a level of awareness, a society perhaps, hidden in the deepest reaches of the Mariana Trench.\n\nWhen we think of intelligent life beyond our own, our minds always travel to distant galaxies, to the farthest reaches of the cosmos where we imagine encountering beings from other worlds. We never consider that such life might exist right here on Earth, lurking in the unexplored depths of our own planet. \n\nThe idea that intelligence could evolve in the crushing darkness of the ocean's abyss, so close yet so alien to us, was terrifying. \n\nIt shattered the comfortable illusion that Earth was fully known and understood, forcing me to confront the possibility that we are not as alone as we believe.\n\nAs the submersible continued its ascent, the questions persisted, haunting me as much as the encounter itself. \n\nWhat else lurked down there, in the depths we had barely begun to explore? \n\nAnd had I just witnessed a glimpse of something humanity was never meant to find? \n\nThe darkness of the ocean's depths might hide more than just ancient secrets; it might conceal a new, horrifying reality we are not prepared to face."

        "selftext": "Not sure if I should put this here but it’s a pretty messed up story, my elementary had a school cop who would come in and teach us basic stuff, don’t do drugs, gun safety etc. He even told us story’s of different cases he’s been on, and one of them was about him getting a call to a hotel about someone refusing to leave. He goes in and owner runs up to him complaining about some fat guy who won’t leave the shower room, they walk over and the guy is unconscious under some running water, he turns it off and has to drag him out, but gets this weird soap all over his arms, and asks the owner to help him drag the guy, but the owner gets grossed out and refuses. Not even halfway of him dragging the guys body, he looks down and realizes what’s on his arms isn’t some weird soap, it’s actually the guys skin falling off. After taking the man to the hospital, it turns out he was working out in the hotel gym and went to the shower room, by the moment he made it he passed out and hit the handle of the one of the showers setting it to the hottest setting. His body was basically boiling and cooking alive like a lobster and his skin fell off in clumps because of that. The cop ended up having to be in the court room as the guy sued the owner, and he was covered in bandages from head to toe like a mummy. "

        "selftext": " \n\n“Daddy! I lost a tooth.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe lisped a bit as he said it, and as I held my hand out I saw that his hand had a tooth in it. It was one of the front ones, and I congratulated him on losing it so cleanly. I wondered if he had pulled it out himself, but I put that out of my mind. Brandon didn’t even pull his own splinters out, and I really couldn’t see him yanking out his own teeth. He was six, six and one month as he liked to say, and this was the first tooth he had lost. He was late in that respect, many of his friends had already started losing baby teeth, but he was giddy as he brought this one to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Now the tooth fairy will come and take it away!” he said, skipping off to continue playing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAh yes, I had forgotten that part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrandon had become obsessed with the Tooth Fairy after his friend Nina had lost her tooth. He thought of her as the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio, and he was very excited that she would come through his window and leave money for his teeth. He had asked what she did with all those teeth, where she got all the money, and a thousand other things. I was a pretty creative person, and I had come up with all kinds of stories about what she did with them, where she got the money, how she came in without making a sound, and on and on and on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was kind of glad that he had finally lost a tooth because I was starting to run out of material and thought if he experienced it he might lose interest in it.\n\nWe put it under his pillow that night and I assured him that it would be gone in the morning and there would be money there when he got up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, of course, I fell asleep waiting for my wife to get home and woke up to find her sleeping beside me and the sun beginning to peek over the horizon. \n\nI went quickly, but quietly, and thanked my lucky stars that Brandon was a sound sleeper. He hadn’t woken up yet, and I took the dollar I was going to put under there out of my pocket and prepared to make the swap. To my surprise, however, the tooth was already gone. No one had left money, but the tooth had disappeared. I looked around, thinking it had slipped out, but it was just gone. I left the dollar anyway, not wanting him to be disappointed, and went back to my room to get a little more shut-eye before the alarm went off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe never made it to the alarm, because Brandon came in waving the dollar and saying the Tooth Fairy had come.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Look what the tooth fairy left me. He said it was all for me.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told him that was awesome but internally I raised an eyebrow. He? The tooth fairy had always been a woman any other time he’d talked about her. Maybe, I thought, Brandon had just had a dream or something last night. He put the money in his piggy bank and I figured we could maybe put this behind us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo days later, as I put him to bed, I put my hand beneath his pillow and felt something strange.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took my hand out and found another tooth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What’s this?” I ask him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Oh, I lost another tooth,” Brandon said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo excitement, no hope that the tooth fairy would come. Just a matter-of-fact tone. I guess that was what I wanted, his obsession with the tooth fairy had ended when he had finally lost a tooth. He’d gone from being absolutely excited to absolutely unphased, and that stopped me for a moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me you had another loose tooth, buddy?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I, uh, don’t know. It just kind of happened.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put the tooth back under his pillow, telling him to make sure to say something next time, and then I kissed him good night and put him to bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to put money under his pillow a little later, though, the tooth wasn’t there. Instead, there was a coin. I took a look at it, thinking it was a half dollar, but realizing I was wrong almost at once. At first, I thought it was one of those weird chocolate coins you sometimes get for Christmas. Turning it, I realized it was just extremely grubby. It was heavy, like it was made out of brass or copper, and the surface looked dirty like it had been at the bottom of a well for quite some time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to take it with me, something in me wanting to keep it away from my son, but I put it back instead. It wasn’t mine, after all, and by the look of it, it was probably something that he treasured. It had been back under his pillow for less than a few seconds before his hand went searching for it. His fingers took hold of it almost greedily as he clutched it, and I decided to take the dollar back with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrandon changed a bit after that night, but it's only in retrospect that I see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe became very secretive, not my little buddy like he used to be. Brandon didn’t want to play video games in the living room with me anymore. He didn’t want to read stories at bedtime anymore. He spent a lot of time in his room, and he just seemed to be closing off. His mother laughed at me when I told her I was feeling a little hurt by it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“He’s just being a kid,” she said, “Kids go through phases sometimes. Don’t take it so personally. In a couple of months, he’ll probably be back to his usual self again.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hoped he would, but it was hard to ignore the physical changes that were going on as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only was Brandon quieter, but it seemed like he had grown. He hadn’t gained a foot in a single week, but sometimes it seemed his fingers were abnormally long, his arms were strangely jointed, and his face was oddly stretched. He would look at me sometimes, look at me like he was thinking about doing something that he knew would make me angry. I didn’t like it, but he never did it right out in the open. Like I said, Brandon never came to sit with me or play video games, but I would sometimes catch him peeking at me from the hallway, or from under the table in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was creepy, but I figured it was just little kid behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA month after Brandon lost his first tooth, I found another one in his backpack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, not just one. I found five hidden in the front pocket of his backpack after he left it on the kitchen table when he went to the bathroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe had become pretty protective of the backpack, putting it in his room or keeping it close to him at all times, and I started getting suspicious of what might be in there. I didn't think it was drugs or anything, he was six, but I thought it might be something weird or dangerous. What if he had a snake or something in there? So when he suddenly ran off to go to the bathroom, I knew this was my chance to have a look. I needed to sign his folder for school anyway, so I took out the folder and looked over the day's report before taking a peek in the pockets. The teeth were just sitting there, bumping together when I poked at them, but they didn’t really look like human teeth. These looked more like animal teeth, and they were too strange to have come out of my son's mouth. They might’ve been from a cat or a dog, I suppose, maybe a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI zipped the backpack and turned around, looking like I’d been caught doing something I shouldn’t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Nothing, just signing your folder.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrandon looked at me with a great deal of distrust, taking the backpack and going to his room without putting his back to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told his mother about the teeth when she came home from work, but she brushed it off again, saying that little kids often collected strange things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“My brothers collected animal skeletons they found out in the woods,” she said dismissively and she got ready for bed, “Thank goodness it’s just teeth and not a whole skull.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI let it go, but it was hard not to see what was going on. Brandon started looking like he wasn’t sleeping well. He had huge bags under his eyes, and he was fidgety anytime he was made to sit still, like at dinner or for homework. He would get short and agitated, muttering to himself in a way I couldn’t understand. I listened carefully once when we were doing math homework, and it sounded like he was talking in a different language. He looked up when he saw me noticing, squinting at me with that look of distrust, and it broke my heart to see him like that. Brandon had always been my little buddy, and this sudden change in him was painful to watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks later, I got a call from the school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey needed to speak to me about something important. Brandon had been in a fight, a fight where he had knocked more than a few of the kids' teeth out. I came down right away, afraid that Brandon was hurt, but when I saw him sitting in the principal's office he looked none the worse for wear. He had a bruise on his cheek, and his hands looked like he beat them against the wall, but he didn’t seem injured or in distress at all. Quite the contrary, Brandon looked happier than I had ever seen him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took a seat next to him in the office, waiting to see what they had thought was so important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“We called you in not because Brandon has been fighting, but because of other rumors going around about him in class.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Rumors?” I asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Yes, sir. The student he fought with said Brandon has been making strange deals with other students.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShook my head, not quite understanding, “What kind of deals?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“They say he has been buying people's teeth.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shuddered, thinking about the teeth in the bag that I saw not long ago. I looked down at Brandon, questioning him with my eyes as to whether or not this was true. He looked back at me without hesitation, pretty much letting me know that it was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“He’s been trading his lunch for them. He’s been trading other things for them, too, like toys and other small things. He has allegedly traded over twenty students for their teeth across three grades. Today, the student in question had taken the trade but refused to give him any teeth. Your son responded by beating the teeth out of his mouth.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked back at Brandon, asking what he was thinking? He didn’t bother to answer, just clinched his fist in his lap and looked at the floor. I think that was when it really hit me how much he had changed. The bags under his eyes were dark and deep, and his fingers were long enough that I couldn’t see how anyone didn’t notice. Each finger seemed twice as long as it should be, and as he clinched, I could see a fourth knuckle on each of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“The reason we called you in, sir, is to get those teeth back.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned and looked at the principal, “What do you mean?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe looked a little green as he wiped his forehead with a napkin, “We believe your son has the missing teeth, but he won’t tell us where they are and he won’t give them back to us. We can’t seem to find them, and the mother is hopeful that the dentist can put them back in if they’re not too badly damaged. If nothing else, they want them back so they can take them to the dentist and make sure the teeth are baby teeth and not permanent. Brandon hasn’t said a word about where he put them, and we are deeply troubled by this behavior.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked at Brandon and asked him where the teeth were?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe shook his head, not saying a word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked him again, and when he shook his head this time, I heard something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething nearly indistinguishable, but altogether unsettling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething was rattling in his mouth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“We can sit here until you decide to give us those teeth, but you’re not leaving until we get them back. I don’t know what’s gotten into you, but,”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea that we wouldn’t be leaving seemed to decide him. He bent slowly over the principal desk, making eye contact with the older man the whole time as he opened his mouth. Three teeth fell out as he pushed his tongue out, and none of them appeared to be his. The teeth clattered onto the desk like old dice, and more than one of them had the root hanging from them. As he sat back up I had the sneaking suspicion that he was holding out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe principal, however, seemed more than okay with what he had gotten back. He told us to go, saying that Brandon was suspended for two weeks, and I collected up my son as we headed for the door. The principal managed not to vomit before we got out of his office, but it was a near thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe talked the entire way home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I talked, and Brandon just sat there and said nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told him I didn’t know what all this was about, but that he needed to stop. This wasn’t him, this wasn’t like him, and he needed to tell me what was going on so that I could help. I was his dad, I wanted to help him, but I couldn’t help him if he didn’t talk to me. The whole time, he just sat there and stared at me. Most kids who are being chastised look out the window or look at their feet, but he stared directly at me in brazen defiance. His fingers kept flexing, and I saw him put a hand to his pocket more than once. I wanted to tell him to turn them out, to give me the tooth from that kid that he had kept, but something in me didn’t dare. I was loath to admit it, but I was a little bit afraid of my son at that moment. He looked nothing like the boy that I had known for almost seven years. My grandma used to tell stories about babies taken by fairies, and the changlings that they left behind. This reminded me of those stories. The kid in front of me was so fundamentally different from the one I knew that it was almost like I was talking to a different person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we pulled up in the yard, I told him he was grounded. No tablet, no TV, no dessert. Brandon didn’t seem to care, he just walked inside and went to his room. His tablet was still on the charger, and his TV remote had been left on the door to his room. I didn’t know what he was doing in there, but it clearly wasn’t playing. He was way too quiet, and when his mother called to tell me she was working a double, I almost cried. I didn’t want to be here alone with him more than I had to be, and that made me feel even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn’t come out for dinner, and when I went to bring him his plate a little while later, I heard muffled voices as he spoke to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I tried to get the teeth, but they caught me.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t know who he was talking to, kind of thought he might be talking to himself, but when a gruff voice responded I felt my stomach drop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“You’ll just have to do better next time.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe voice was unlike anything I had ever heard. It was deep and watery, like something from the bottom of a well, and it spoke in a way that made its mouth sound strangely full. It was devoid of any kind of kindness or charity, the sounds you sometimes hear when people speak to children. It was an authoritarian invoice, the teacher, and they were not pleased with my son.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I’m grounded, they suspended me from school. I’m not going to be able to get you any teeth for at least two weeks.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Your father has teeth,” it said matter-of-factly, “Your mother has teeth too.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen he answered, he didn’t sound afraid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen he answered, it was with cold assuredness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“They won’t just give them to me. They don’t understand what I’m doing.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat was he doing? That’s what I wanted to know. I gripped the doorknob, hoping they wouldn’t hear me, and that was when the voice said something that made my blood run cold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Then do not ask for them. Take them, like you did from the boy today.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened the door in one fluid motion, and my son looked up guilty as I walked into his room\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Who are you talking to?\" I asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“No one,” he said much too quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I heard someone,” I said, “I heard someone in here talking to you, and I wanted to know who it was, and where they went.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was a lie. I didn’t think I wanted to know who they were. What I wanted was for them to never come back again. The person had sounded like some kind of demonic fairy from a kid's story, and I was afraid of what I would see if he did come back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“It’s nothing,” Brandon said much too quickly again, “I was doing voices.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to him for a little while longer, but I got nothing. He wouldn’t talk to me, he wouldn’t tell me anything, and eventually I just left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should’ve left it at that, I should have just left it alone, but I had to try one more time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was late, about ten thirty which was pretty late for us, and I decided to try a peace offering. I felt pretty certain he was still awake, I had heard something moving around in there, and so I cut some of the pie I had made to go with dinner and walked to his room. I was going to offer him the pie and see if maybe we could talk. I just wanted to know what it was that had made him change so much. Most of all, I just wanted my son back. It killed me to have him act like this, but as the door came open, I got more answers than I had bargained for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was standing over his bed with its arm going under his pillow, and in the darkness of his room, I realized it had to be what he'd been talking to. The pie fell to the ground, but I had a death grip on the plate, and I realized I had sprained my thumb once I was in any state to feel it. I didn’t speak, I could barely breathe and as the thing turned to look at me I realized my fairy theory might not be too far off. It was grubby looking, like something that’s been living in a ditch. Its features were completely covered in something dark that had the texture of earth, except for the two large lamp-like eyes that protrude from its face like bubble lights. It was tall, something I realized as it took its full height. It had been crouching before, putting something under my son’s pillow, and it had to stoop so as not to bang its head on the ceiling, which is about nine feet from the floor. From its back, four insect like wings protruded. They weren't large enough to carry it, but they were large enough to be noticeable. Its hands and arms, the fingers multi-jointed, were far from delicate looking as it wiggled them ceaselessly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI expected it to charge me, I expected it to attack me, but instead, it raised one huge finger to its face and made a shush sound.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Shhhh, you’ll wake the baby,” it whispered, and its mouth sounded like it was trying to swallow something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen it smiled, and I saw not a double but a triple row of teeth inside its mouth. There’s no order to them, molars next to canines next to bicuspid next to what appear to be fangs and shark teeth. Its mouth is such a mishmash of teeth that it’s impossible not to feel a little woozy when you look at it. It pulled its lips down, somehow containing all those teeth, and before my very eyes, it vanished.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy son was pretty upset when I grabbed him up and carried him out of the house.\n\nI put him in the car, and we waited till his mother got off work before taking him to a nearby motel. I told her what I had seen, as best as I could, and I think she believes there might be something going on now. My son is furious, saying he needs to get back home so that he can do his job, but he won’t say what that is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I think he’s been collecting teeth for whatever that thing was.\n\nWhen I went back to get us some clothes and check the house, I looked under his pillow and found another of those strange coins. There’s a box under his bed, and inside it’s equal parts teeth and coins. There are around twenty of them, and they’re sitting next to teeth of every shape and every size. Most of them are animal teeth, but some of them are definitely human teeth. I’ve taken the entire box with me, but the phone call I got from my wife before I left the house was what really worried me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe called to tell me that our son had locked himself in the bathroom, and she was afraid he was hurting himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“There’s a weird squelching sound, followed by him yelling and crying.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe had locked himself in the bathroom, but I went and got the manager to unlock it for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we found there will stay with me for a very long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe’re at the hospital now, my wife is in the ER room with him while I sit in the waiting room and wait for updates. The protocol states only one parent can go in at a time, and my son doesn’t want me to go in there. He can’t speak very well, but he made that very clear to my wife. I gave him space, not wanting to exacerbate his condition any more than I had to. I’ve got the box on my lap as I sit out here, and I’m not really sure what to do with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInside are the eight teeth he managed to pull out of his own head before we got him restrained.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever this creature is, it must get its due, and my son was apparently intent on giving it that due.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe'll probably end up having to take him to a mental facility, but I know he isn’t crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw that thing, too, and I know it will find him no matter where we take him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo be very careful when you tell your kids about the tooth fairy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat comes to collect their teeth might be something far worse than even you could imagine."

The ache came and went like the waves of the ocean. An ocean of molten lava, that is.\n\nExpanding and retracting.\n\nI was in a void of pure darkness. My brain; the poor rattled thing, it begged me to stay asleep, but the repeated concussive blows traveling from underneath my eye wouldn’t let me stay asleep.\n\nMy entire body screamed at me to wake up, screamed at me to open my eyes and face the music.

Necrosis born because of the buildup of a byproduct of flawed human design; lactic acid.\n\nThe aching of my form finally pried my eyes open…\n\nEverything seemed so… dark and foreign… alien, almost… Strange features were dancing around my tunneled field of vision. The fabric of reality was melting right before my eyes. Different shades of gray and black flowed into each other.\n\nA mixture of bizarre goo shaping my perception.\n\nWithout a warning, another flash of light exploded right behind my eyes. A volcanic eruption inside my head. The pain was unbearable. I could feel an icepick digging into the back of my skull. Everything started spinning to the sound of a million flies buzzing somewhere in the distance.\n\nThe digestive track began working backwards, and I felt the esophageal muscles spasming. My heart burned, my brain was falling part inside the cranium and everything else was torn to pieces.\n\nIn an attempt to ease the suffering, I shifted my head backwards.\n\nMy blood ran cold, the sensations of pins and needles traveling against my skin overtook every other feeling in that moment. The drumming of my heartbeat grew louder by the moment.\n\nI was hanging by one hang from the window bars of a fourth store building…\n\nMy left hand was barely holding on anymore. It began shaking from the strain. Fear kept my other muscles locked in place. Fighting through it was harder than I could ever imagine. The mere act of pulling my right arm upward was excruciating. The bones were broken and covered in blood.\n\nI didn’t want to die…\n\nWith every ounce of remaining strength, I pushed my mangled arm upward before grabbing onto the window bars. The cold breeze barely grazing my skin felt like smoldering knives were being shoved into my flesh.\n\nNearly lost my grip.\n\nSwinging to the side, I slammed myself into the wall and thought I was going to die from the pain. Wasn’t much of an impact. Hand slipped from exhaustion.\n\nFear, mortal fear. Survival instincts took over and forced my abused form to claw at the window ledge with all of its might. I kept falling into those four stores in my head, over and over and over as my body pulled itself into an unfamiliar apartment.\n\nFinding myself lying on steady ground didn’t make the imaginary cycle of demise leave my mind. Only made it worse, more graphic, more detailed. I wasn’t falling to my death anymore.\n\nI was being ripped in half.\n\nBeheaded.\n\nCompressed into a pile of human waste matter.\n\nObliterated by projectiles.\n\nElectrified into dust.\n\nMy throat slit.\n\nMy limbs cut off.\n\nMy face peeled off.\n\nBleeding out.\n\nSkull caved in.\n\nCrawling alone in an unfamiliar place. Crawling in a pool of blood. Surrounded by corpses.\n\nMutilated corpses, unidentifiable human remains, pieces of meat.\n\nRiddled with bullets, cut open, bones exposed, organs harvested, hanging from entrails, splattered on a wall, spine extracted, bones mixed with the wood in the fireplace.\n\nThe stench of death was violating me as I crawled through the corridors of hell. It forced its way down my throat, threatening to choke me as I crossed a bodiless head with a heart in its mouth.\n\nI screamed myself hoarse with fear.\n\nA lightning bolt flashed outside.\n\nDarkness…\n\nEverything stood still…\n\nAnother lightning bolt flashed, illuminating the room.\n\nA flayed figure was right next to me.\n\nA bloody hand reached for my face.\n\nThere was a murmur…\n\nThunder cracked directly above me…\n\nA muffled cry for help...\n\nRaspy and low...\n\nI could feel it grabbing me, its wet fingers digging into my leg…\n\nA lightning bolt exploded right in front of my eyes… and silence…\n\nDarkness\n\nThere was nothing but darkness…\n\nAn empty void…\n\nThe light came back on as suddenly as it vanished.\n\nI was in a pristine apartment… Dizzy with stress and blood loss. My blood staining some fancy-looking rag. Everything was so slow and unfocused. My ears ringing, my body aching, my right arm barely hanging on by a thread of muscle. A layer of red covering my right eye. Breathing hurt. Everything hurt.\n\nDeath was near….\n\nDeath came as a high pitched cackling.\n\nMy gaze shifted, pushing through volley after volley of stingers coursing through my neck.\n\nIt just sat there…\n\nChewing on a piece of meat…\n\nA Hyena-muzzled naked man…\n\nThe unnatural shape of this thing. A grotesque and malignant amalgamation of features. Impure, senseless and leprous design.\n\nNothing but pure invasive and unrelenting horror.\n\nEvery fiber in my body moved while my brain remained fixated on the indescribable picture burned into recollection.\n\nI ran, I don’t know how I far I ran. I have no idea how I got out of there and I don’t know where I ended up collapsing. When I woke up, I was at the hospital.\n\nMy injuries were consistent with a bear mauling. I pretended to have lost my memory, not wanting to remember. I wish I couldn’t remember that thing. Unfortunately, that’s the only thing I seem to remember these days…\n\nEvery now and again, it invades my mind and everything else becomes blurry and distant.\n\nEvery now and again, I can see it standing right across the room from me.\n\nSimply staring, and smiling its blood-stained smile.\n\nCackling that hideous high-pitched laughter.\n\nEvery time I see it, it’s getting closer….\n\nI can already feel its fetid breath on the back of my neck…"
