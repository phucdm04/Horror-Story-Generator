We've been largely hands-off, letting people decide with upvotes and downvotes as opposed to micro-managing.\n\nAdditionally, we didn't want to send users to subreddits owned and run by other teams because - to be honest - we can't vouch for others, and whether or not they would treat users well and allow you guys to post all the things you post here. (In other words, we don't always agree with the strictness or tone of some other subreddits, and didn't want to make you guys go to those, instead.)\n\nTo that end, we've come up with a solution of sorts.\n\nWe started r\/IconPasta long ago, for fandom-related posts about Jeff the Killer, BEN, Ticci Toby, and the rest.\n\nWe started r\/HorrorNarrations as well, for narrators to have a specific place that was \"just for them\" without being drowned out by a thousand other types of posts.\n\nSo, now, we're announcing r\/EyeScream for creepy, disturbing, and just plain \"weird\" images!\n\nAt r\/EyeScream, you can count on us to be just as hands-off, only interfering with posts when they break Reddit ToS or our very light rules. (No Gore, No Porn, etc.)\n\nWe hope you guys have fun being the first users there - this is your opportunity to help build and influence what r\/EyeScream is, and will become, for years to come!"},"2":{"title":"To whoever made that cursed Reddit post: you\u2019ve doomed us all.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkxpxq\/to_whoever_made_that_cursed_reddit_post_youve\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"SAG_Official","selftext":"I don\u2019t normally comment on places like this.

Brandon had met a girl, Rachel, who brought light into his shadowed existence. Her laughter was like a balm to his soul, her curiosity a refreshing breeze in his stale, fear-filled world. Yet, the whispers of the game had never truly left him, lurking just beneath the surface, waiting for their moment.\n\n\n\nOne evening, Rachel found an old NES cartridge of Super Mario Bros 3 in a dusty corner of Brandon's closet. Her eyes lit up with excitement, and she popped it into the retro console without a second thought. Brandon's heart skipped a beat, but he said nothing, his mind racing with the horrors that could unfold.\n\n\n\nBut the game played as it should. The music was cheerful, the graphics as charmingly retro as ever. Rachel played for hours, her giggles filling the room, her eyes sparkling with the joy of discovery. Brandon watched her from the sidelines, a tight knot in his stomach slowly unraveling. Perhaps the demonic Mario was a figment of his traumatized imagination, a manifestation of his guilt over Mike's death.\n\n\n\nBut then came the scream. High-pitched and filled with terror, it pierced the air like a shard of ice. Rachel lay on the floor, the controller still clutched in her lifeless hand, the TV screen flickering with the image of the Mushroom Kingdom. Brandon's heart plummeted, his worst fears realized. The game had found a new player, and it wasn't going to let go without a fight.\n\n\n\n\"Not again,\" he murmured, his voice a broken whisper. He knew he had to save Rachel, to prevent the game from claiming another victim. He picked up the controller, his hands shaking as he started the game from the beginning. This time, though, it felt different. The music was peaceful, the colors vibrant, and there were no signs of the corrupted code that had haunted him before.\n\n\n\nHe played through the levels, his eyes darting to Rachel's unmoving form every few moments. Each victory brought him closer to the castle, hope blossoming in his chest like a flower in springtime. But when he reached Bowser's lair and defeated the king of the Koopas, the screen didn't fade to credits. Instead, it warped, the colors swirling into a new, horrifying landscape.\n\n\n\nThe world of Mario's Exile unfolded before him, a place that looked like a twisted reflection of his own nightmares. The once-friendly faces of the Mushroom Kingdom were now grotesque, their cries for help replaced by taunts and laughter that chilled him to the bone. This was a game within a game, a prison for lost souls, and Rachel was trapped in its digital hell.\n\n\n\nWith a steely resolve, Brandon set out to conquer the six hellish levels of this new realm. Each stage was a testament to fear and despair, a gauntlet that pushed him to his limits. But with every pixelated creature he vanquished, every obstacle he overcame, the whispers grew fainter, the grip of the game loosened.\n\n\n\nThe final castle loomed before him, a twisted spire of darkness that pierced the very sky. He knew that inside, his girlfriend waited for him, her soul bound by the demonic force he had unwittingly released into their world. The stakes were higher than ever, and failure was not an option.\n\n\n\nThe music grew louder, the screen flickering with each step he took. The digital world felt more real than ever, the weight of his mission crushing him like an unseen force. He had to save Rachel, to free her from the game's malevolent clutches before it was too late.\n\n\n\nThe castle walls pulsed with malevolent energy, the very air thick with the stench of corrupted code. Brandon took a deep breath and stepped through the gates, ready to face the horrors that awaited him within. The game had started as a simple escape from reality, but now it had become his reality, a prison that could only be unlocked by his own hand.\n\n\n\nHe ventured deeper, the game's world morphing around him, each room a puzzle that tested his sanity. The whispers grew louder, the game's power feeding on his fear and doubt. But Brandon pushed forward, driven by his love for Rachel and his need for vengeance. The castle walls closed in, the air thick with the digital stench of corruption.\n\n\n\nThe final chamber lay before him, a chamber of horrors that made his stomach lurch. On pikes, a gruesome display of heads impaled, taunting him with the faces of those the game had claimed. His eyes fell upon Mike's lifeless gaze, forever frozen in terror. The room spun, and he had to clench his fists to keep from falling to his knees. Rage boiled within him, a fiery resolve that drowned out his fear.\n\n\n\nIn the center of the room, a cage suspended from the ceiling held Rachel captive. Her eyes widened with hope when she saw him, her voice barely a whisper. \"Brandon, is that you?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm here,\" he said, his voice hoarse with emotion. \"I'll get you out.\"\n\n\n\nThe demonic Mario lounged on a throne made of twisted circuit boards, his once-friendly visage now a grotesque mockery of its former self. \"Ah, so eager to save your little damsel,\" he cackled. \"But you're forgetting, this is my world now.\"\n\n\n\nBrandon's eyes never left Rachel as he stepped into the room, his hand tight on the plunger of a bomb he had picked up along the way. \"You really think it's going to be that easy?\" Mario jeered.\n\n\n\nWith a fierce roar, Brandon hurled the explosive at the creature. The bomb struck the throne, the explosion lighting up the room in a blinding flash of white. The digital demon roared, but when the dust settled, it remained unscathed, its laughter echoing through the chamber.\n\n\n\n\"You fool,\" Mario sneered, rising to his feet. \"You can't harm me here. But I'll give you one chance to save her. Beat me, one final time, and I'll release her soul.\"\n\n\n\nThe challenge was clear, the stakes never higher. Brandon steeled himself, ready to face the game's ultimate boss fight. Rachel's eyes searched his, a silent plea for rescue. The digital world around them grew darker, the air thick with anticipation.\n\n\n\nThe battle was brutal, a dance of pixels and fire. Brandon's heart pounded with each blow he landed, his movements precise and driven by pure instinct. He dodged fireballs and leapt over pits of lava, the game pushing him to his limits. Rachel's cage swung dangerously with each explosion, a constant reminder of what was at stake.\n\n\n\nAs he dealt the final blow, the demonic Mario let out a wail that seemed to shake the very foundation of reality. The room trembled, the cage broke apart, and Rachel fell into his arms. The game world around them began to disintegrate, the colors fading to a cold, digital void.\n\n\n\nThey clung to each other, tears mixing with the digital ash that rained down from the collapsing ceiling. Rachel was free, but the game was far from over. The whispers grew louder, the power of the cartridge surging as it sought new prey.\n\n\n\nBrandon knew that he had to destroy the cartridge, to end the game's grip on their world. But as he looked into Rachel's eyes, he realized the battle was far from won. The game had claimed Mike, and it would not rest until it had claimed him too.\n\n\n\nThe digital world collapsed around them, the apartment reasserting itself. Rachel looked at him with a mix of fear and hope. \"What now?\" she whispered.\n\n\n\nHe held her close, the weight of his decision heavy on his shoulders. \"We'll find a way,\" he said, determination in his voice. \"We're going to end this together.\"\n\n\n\nThe game was defeated, but the war was just beginning. They stepped out of the apartment into the hallway, the digital whispers still echoing in their minds. Rachel leaned into Brandon's embrace, her heart racing with fear and relief. They had survived, but the nightmare wasn't over. The game waited, biding its time, ready to claim them both if they weren't careful.\n\n\n\nThey descended the stairs, the cacophony of digital screams fading into the distance. Rachel's words echoed in Brandon's mind as he clutched the broken shards of the cartridge, the plastic warm from his fiery rage. He had destroyed the game, but the thought of others falling prey to such horrors was unbearable.\n\n\n\nThe night was cool, the moon casting a silver glow upon the quiet streets. Rachel's eyes searched his, understanding the burden he now carried. \"We can't let this happen to anyone else,\" she said, her voice firm. \"We have to find the other cursed games and destroy them.\"\n\n\n\nBrandon nodded, the gravity of their mission settling in. They couldn't just live their lives, knowing that somewhere out there, other innocents were being consumed by the digital abyss. They had to act.\n\n\n\nThey started researching, digging through forgotten forums and obscure websites that spoke of games with similar dark reputations. Rachel's empathy grew into a fierce resolve as they pieced together the scattered reports of missing gamers and bizarre occurrences tied to certain cartridges. The more they learned, the more they realized that they were not the only ones who had encountered the game's dark secrets.\n\n\n\nArmed with this newfound knowledge, they embarked on a quest to rid the world of the cursed games. Garage sales, flea markets, and dusty old game stores became their battlegrounds. They searched tirelessly, their eyes peeled for any sign of the telltale corruption: the slightly off-colored label, the eerie stillness of a game left untouched for too long.\n\n\n\nEach cartridge they found, they destroyed with a sense of grim satisfaction, the digital whispers silenced with a crackle and a hiss of electrical death. But with every victory, the whispers grew stronger, more insistent, as if the game itself was aware of their crusade. Brandon could feel it, a shadowy presence that watched and waited, biding its time.\n\n\n\nOne fateful evening, they stumbled upon a hidden store, its neon sign flickering ominously in the alley. The air was thick with the scent of decaying electronics, and the shelves groaned under the weight of forgotten games. Rachel's eyes widened as she spotted a row of unmarked cartridges, their surfaces pulsating with an unsettling glow.\n\n\n\n\"Jackpot,\" she murmured, a mix of excitement and fear in her voice. Brandon felt his heart quicken, his hand tightening around the hammer in his pocket. They had found the source, the breeding ground for these digital abominations. It was time to strike a blow that would resonate through the game world itself.\n\n\n\nThe store owner, a hunched figure with a crazed glint in his eye, watched them from the shadows. \"You're not like the others,\" he croaked, his voice a digitized rasp. \"You see the truth.\"\n\n\n\nThey didn't wait for an explanation, their mission clear. They grabbed the cursed cartridges, their hearts racing as they smashed each one into oblivion. The room grew cold, the whispers grew louder, and the air grew thick with the stench of burning plastic and malevolent energy.\n\n\n\nAs the last cartridge shattered, the world around them warped and contorted. The walls buckled, and the floor gave way to a bottomless pit of swirling pixels. Rachel clung to Brandon, her eyes wide with terror, but he remained steadfast.\n\n\n\n\"We're not done yet,\" he said, his voice strong and determined. \"We'll end this.\"\n\n\n\nTogether, they stepped into the digital abyss, ready to face the game's ultimate form and free the trapped souls within. The whispers grew into a deafening roar, the colors of the game world swirling around them like a maelstrom. The battle was on, and there would be no turning back.\n\n\n\nTheir journey had only just begun, a quest to conquer the darkness that lurked within the pixels of their childhood memories. The fate of the trapped souls rested on their shoulders, a burden they bore with grim determination. They would fight the game, destroy its hold on the real world, and ensure that no one else would suffer the fate of Mike and the others."},"5":{"title":"I read a cursed post, and now I'm seeing things...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkn2lq\/i_read_a_cursed_post_and_now_im_seeing_things\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"SAG_Official","selftext":"So I don\u2019t even know how to start this.\n\nI was browsing r\/shortscarystories last night and came across this post\u2014pretty sure the title was *\u201cThis post\u2019s cursed, seriously don\u2019t click\u2026\u201d*.

They're coming down the alley,\" said Marco.\n\nLooking in the direction he pointed, I saw them. There were at least five animated monstrosities shuffling their way towards us.\n\nTurning to follow the group out of the alley, I took the time to glare at that window one last time, praying an unanswered prayer to see my friend safely exiting.\n\nAfter reaching the road at the end of the alley, we peered around the corner and came to a bone-chilling discovery. Large pools of strewn intestines and dark puddles of blood painted the road, but we found no torn-apart bodies.\n\nI pondered a moment as to what may have happened to them. But that was short-lived as I watched the wrecked corpse of the once-beautiful bartender shuffle from between some bushes near the horrid scene and begin lumbering in our direction.\n\n\"Shit, shit, shit,\" said Jeff at the realization we would have to go through the woman to escape the now-running group of monsters behind us.\n\n\"Let's go now!\" shouted Tim before shoving me in the back and beckoning the others to follow.\n\nI began a mad dash in the woman's direction, lowering my shoulder. I shoved her onto her back. The impact dazed me as our skulls collided.\n\n\"Marco,\" I beckoned before holding out my hands and asking for the paddle.\n\nMarco handed me the paddle and began helping Jeff with Jim.\n\nThe woman attempted to spring from the ground and attack me, but I swung the paddle and landed a stunning blow to her now-torn-open skull. The splatter of dark blood that clung to the paddle started to slowly drip from its end.\n\nI took a pause and watched as the twisted face of the girl began to twitch and move once again. The realization of what I was being forced to do set in and started to weigh on me.\n\nThe face of the girl, however mangled, started to move and twitch more as I noticed one of its eyelids slide open and start to take in sight again.\n\nBefore she could launch a second attempt, I lifted the paddle above my head and heaved down hard in a chopping motion, bringing the poor girl's second life to a shattering end.\n\nThe blood flew in all directions, including mine. I attempted to swing my head away, but it was far too late. The splatter reached my mouth, eyes, and nose, causing an instantaneous panic to set into my consciousness.\n\n\"No, no, NO, NO! Shit, shit, shit!\" I yelled while spitting out the bitter taste of brain fluid and blood. \"It's in my fucking mouth!\"\n\nThe vision that was taken from me by the surprisingly cold blood only served to heighten my sense of fear.\n\nSliding my shirt off over my head, I quickly smeared the blood from my eyes and attempted to open them but found the vile fluid burned like the gas I had experienced in Vietnam.\n\n\"Ah, shit!\" I exclaimed.\n\nPanic now rising to unbearable levels as the horrible sounds of the shuffling horde entered earshot.\n\nThankfully, I felt the arm of one of my friends wrap around me and guide me to safety.\n\nIt, of course, was Marco who said, \"C'mon, brother, I got you. Let's get the hell out of here. Just take it easy and listen to what I say. We will get out of this.\"\n\nWe found our way into the small backyard of a little restaurant that had a fence and gate.\n\nJeff volunteered to climb over and check it out. Upon his surveillance of the yard, he unlocked the tall gate and allowed us inside.\n\n\"Alright, man, there's a hose over here. Let's get this shit out of your eyes,\" whispered Marco as he guided me to the water and turned it on for me.\n\nThe water felt warm at first, but after a little while, it turned freezing cold. The cold helped to ease the burning pain I felt.\n\nI found the ability to comfortably open my eyes return to me after a few minutes of flushing them.\n\nLooking up from where I crouched, I found the others huddled up across the small yard from me, talking in a quiet whisper.\n\n\"Guys, what's up?\" I asked.\n\nI could tell that my question made them uneasy. The looks on their faces when they turned to face me suited in driving home that notion.\n\n\"We're not really sure what to do with you, John,\" Tim said bluntly.\n\n\"What he means is we're worried about you, buddy, and we think you could have caught whatever they have,\" followed Marco quickly, wiping large streams of sweat from his head.\n\n\"Goddammit,\" I said internally before responding, \"Boys, aside from some burning eyes, I feel great... hell, even the burn is almost gone with the water.\"\n\nThe cloud of unease failed to drift away from my friends at my words' request.\n\n\"I think we need to...\" Jeff's hushed words were cut off by the sounds of offbeat shuffling feet and deep guttural growling that echoed from the other side of the wooden fence.\n\nI held a finger to my mouth to help state the obvious sentiment of \"shut the hell up\" to the rest of the group.\n\nI peered around the corner of the restaurant and found that there was a side door just around the corner. \n\nTilting my head in the direction of the door to tell them about it, I slowly made my way over to it before cupping my hands around my face and attempting to look inside.\n\nThe restaurant was deserted and, save for a couple of neon palm tree signs hanging from the walls, completely dark.\n\nI looked back toward the guys who were now huddled up near the corner of the building before grabbing the handle and twisting it.\n\nTo all of our surprise, the door was left unlocked, and taking advantage of that fact, we crept inside.\n\nAs one might have guessed, the restaurant was beach-themed, with little tropical decorations scattered haphazardly across all the surfaces.\n\nThe dining area was unremarkable, holding only six tables loaded with decor and a small stage for live music. However, across from the dining area sat a large wooden bar top littered with the island's finest selection of alcohol.\n\nThe joy our little group would have once found in an environment such as this was completely murdered by the sharp, jagged teeth of despair that bore down on the world outside its walls.\n\n\"I need to sit down for a minute,\" said Jim as large rivers of sweat cascaded down his face and soaked his shirt.\n\n\"Ankle?\" asked Tim in worry.\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Jim before hobbling over to the bar and resting on a stool.\n\n\"How's the bite?\" questioned Jeff.\n\n\"Pre...\" replied Tim, whose words were cut off by Marco's curt \"Fine.\"\n\nConfused at first, I suddenly became reawakened to the fact that Marco had been bitten by the disfigured woman in the street.\n\n\"Shit, dude, I forgot that lady bit you... are you... you good?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, I'm fine. She barely left scratches,\" he responded while raising his arm in an attempt to reassure us.\n\nJeff seemed to have a small breakdown at his realization. We were locked in this small restaurant, injury-riddled and exhausted.\n\n\"Look, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think we need to separate you guys from us for a while,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" questioned Marco. \"Dude, you can't be serious... separate HOW?\" He pushed, annoyed at the suggestion.\n\n\"Look, I don't know what the fuck is going on out there, guys, but it clearly spreads. I mean, hell, look at Johnny boy's bartender\u2014perfectly normal running for her life one minute, crazy drugged-out maniac the next.\"\n\nHis words stirred up the event that had transpired just minutes earlier. I remembered the look on her face as those things tore into her. I recall the horror that filled me as I stood over her and split her head with that paddle. I remember the small moment we shared earlier that night in the bar.\n\nI again reached for the slip of paper in my pocket and pulled it out into the dim stream of light coming from the neon signs.\n\nAllowing my eyes to focus in the dark, I found the paper soaked in blood... her own blood had soaked through my tan shorts and blotted the paper. The irony of the situation was rightfully stomped out by the sheer overwhelming wash of emotions I felt in that minute.\n\nThe breath in my lungs became ragged as it all weighed down on me like a truck. The death of this young woman... the death of Danny. I found the final sting in my eyes washed away with my tears."},"7":{"title":"Haphephobia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkymnq\/haphephobia\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Eastern_Ad7411","selftext":"\nI believe everyone has something they\u2019re scared of.\n\nClowns, bugs, colors.

Until they try to shake my hand and I flinch like they\u2019ve pulled a knife. Until they see me panic when someone brushes past me in a crowd. It\u2019s not a quirk. It\u2019s not a preference. It\u2019s a condition.\n\n\u201cHow do you function in society?\u201d they ask.\n\nI manage. I keep to myself. The people around me know the rules\u2014don\u2019t touch me. Don\u2019t get close.

You wouldn\u2019t believe the things people do in their \u201csafe spaces.\u201d The things they hide from even themselves.\n\nOver time, I started becoming\u2026 curious. About fear.\n\nSee, it started with a break-in. A client\u2019s daughter got locked in the bathroom during a home invasion. The footage showed her screaming, shaking, losing control. She was terrified\u2014not of the intruder\u2014but of the dark. Classic Nyctophobia. Something about the total absence of light paralyzed her more than the threat itself.\n\nIt stayed with me.\n\nI wanted to understand more. How fear grips people. So I began researching phobias. At first, clinically. Articles. Videos. But that wasn\u2019t enough. I wanted to see it. I wanted to feel it. Real fear. Raw. Unfiltered.\n\nThat\u2019s when I met Suzy.\n\nWe talked online. Shared memes. Trauma. She thought I was just another shut-in with social anxiety. She told me her younger sister had an extreme fear of frogs. Ranidaphobia. Even seeing one on a screen made her gag. Apparently, when they were kids, a cousin locked her in a greenhouse with a few bullfrogs and she fainted. It stuck.\n\nI asked questions. I took notes. Then, I made a plan.\n\nSuzy didn\u2019t know it, of course. But her sister\u2014Aly\u2014was going to help me understand fear.\n\nI watched their home for weeks. Studied the layout. Their habits.

Knocked her out when she came back in. Quick. Quiet. She didn\u2019t even see my face.\n\nShe woke up in a basement filled with frogs. Tiny ones. Fat ones. Vibrant green, warty brown, even those translucent albino kinds that look like ghost skin. I covered the floor, the shelves, even the ceiling rafters. The walls were soundproofed. The door was sealed.\n\nShe screamed so loud it vibrated the camera feed.\n\nThe footage was beautiful.\n\nShe clawed at her skin. Tried to climb the walls. At one point, she tried to eat one, just to end it. But the best part? She texted Suzy. I must\u2019ve missed her phone in the panic.\n\nSuzy started blowing up my DMs. \u201cMy sister\u2019s gone.\u201d \u201cShe says she\u2019s trapped.\u201d \u201cShe says there are frogs.\u201d\n\nI told her I\u2019d help. Told her I\u2019d check their home security. I acted concerned.\n\nAnd Suzy, sweet naive Suzy, gave me her address.\n\nI brought flowers. Said I was from the company.\n\nNow she\u2019s in the basement too.\n\nI let Aly go. Gave her a sedative. Dropped her near a hospital. She won\u2019t talk. They never do. Who would believe her? A room of frogs? She\u2019ll get institutionalized at best.\n\nBut Suzy? She\u2019s been more\u2026 resistant.\n\nLast night, she started talking. Whispering, actually. Said she figured it out. Said she knows who I am.\n\nSo I took her eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see fear when you have no eyes. But you can still feel it. Especially when your hearing sharpens. She can hear the frogs. She can feel them hop across her skin. She can smell them.\n\nShe won\u2019t be a long-term subject. But she\u2019ll serve her purpose.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for the next one.\n\nYou seem interested. You\u2019ve read this far, haven\u2019t you?\n\nSo tell me\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s your phobia?\n\nDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll find out eventually."},"8":{"title":"I Found an Old Super Mario Bros 2 Cartridge in a Dusty Corner of My Room","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkxqi8\/i_found_an_old_super_mario_bros_2_cartridge_in_a\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"The months passed, and the memory of that night slowly began to fade. The TV remained untouched, a silent sentinel to the terror they had faced. They had told no one, fearing ridicule or worse\u2014that someone else would stumble upon the cursed game and unleash the digital demon. But a year later, a strange craving for nostalgia overcame Brandon. He couldn't resist the allure of the old NES games, the simple yet addictive charm that had captured his imagination as a child.\n\n\n\nIn a dusty corner of his room, he found an old Super Mario Bros 2 cartridge. The image on the label was unlike any he had seen before. It depicted a twisted, grotesque version of Mario, with rotted flesh hanging from his bones and black pits where his eyes should have been. A shiver ran down his spine, but he couldn't deny the morbid curiosity that gripped him. Was this a twisted prank? Or a forgotten relic of a darker time in gaming history?\n\n\n\nIgnoring Mike's warnings, Brandon plugged the cartridge into his retro gaming system, his heart racing. The game booted up, the colors and sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom filling the room once more. But something was off, the colors slightly duller, the music a discordant twist on the original's cheerful tune. The game played normally, almost too normally, until he reached the first boss stage\u2014a nightmarish version of Birdo, the pink dragon from his youth. It spit eggs that hatched into tiny, screaming Marios, their eyes glowing with the same malevolent light he remembered from that fateful night.\n\n\n\nHe took a deep breath, his thumbs poised on the controller, and stepped into the fray. As he defeated the twisted creature, it shrieked, its eyes fading to black. The game flickered, and for a brief moment, he could have sworn he saw the demonic Mario watching from within the screen, its smile widening, eager for the next challenge. Brandon felt a cold hand clamp down on his shoulder.\n\n\n\nMike's face was a mask of horror. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" he whispered.\n\n\n\nThe TV's static grew louder, the room's edges blurring. The floorboards creaked, and the walls bulged as if something was pushing through from another dimension. Brandon's heart skipped a beat. Had they unleashed something even more terrifying than before?\n\n\n\nThe game's world began to glitch around them, the screen distorting and pulsing with an unnatural energy. The door to the apartment slammed shut, the lock clicking into place. The air grew colder, the lights dimming as if in response to the game's power growing stronger.\n\n\n\n\"We have to finish this,\" Brandon said, his voice shaking. \"We can't let it take us again.\"\n\n\n\nThey steeled themselves, ready to face whatever nightmares the game had in store. They were no longer just players in a video game; they were the only defense against a digital monster that had invaded their lives.\n\n\n\nAs they continued through the warped levels, each stage grew more disturbing than the last. The familiar characters of the Mushroom Kingdom were now twisted reflections of themselves, their cries for help echoing through the game's corrupted code. Brandon felt a knot in his stomach, the weight of his decision to play the game heavy upon him.\n\n\n\nThe final boss loomed before them, a towering beast that was somehow both Bowser and the demonic Mario from the first game. Its digital eyes bored into Brandon's soul, and he knew that this time, there would be no easy escape.\n\n\n\nThey had to win. For their sake, and for all those who might stumble upon this cursed game in the future. They had to break the cycle of fear and terror that had been set into motion by that fateful garage sale purchase.\n\n\n\nWith a deep breath, Brandon looked to Mike, who nodded solemnly. They were in this together, and they would conquer the digital hell that had invaded their reality. The battle began, the air crackling with energy. The beast roared, and the walls of their apartment trembled in response.\n\n\n\nThe fight was intense, their hearts pounding in their chests. Each hit they landed on the creature caused the room to shake, the very fabric of their world threatening to tear apart. The demonic Mario was unforgiving, each blow he dealt sending shockwaves through the floorboards. But they were determined. For every pixelated piece of themselves that was lost, they fought back with a ferocity born of desperation.\n\n\n\nThen, without warning, the game glitched, and Birdo appeared before them, crying pools of pixelated tears. The sight was heartbreaking, a stark contrast to the fear that had driven them this far. The creature looked up at them, its digital eyes pleading. \"You can stop this,\" it croaked, the sound of a dying computer chip.\n\n\n\nBefore they could react, the demonic Mario shoved his fingers into Birdo's eyes, and there was a horrifying squishing and popping sound. The screen flickered, the room darkening for a moment. The walls trembled as Birdo's lifeless body slumped to the ground, her digital blood seeping into the floorboards. \"This sick twisted game has gone on long enough,\" Brandon thought, his anger fueling his resolve.\n\n\n\nThey launched themselves at the creature, dodging its fiery breath and hammering away with all their might. Each hit landed with a satisfying crunch, the game's code screaming in protest. The creature stumbled back, its smile now a snarl of rage. It lashed out, and in a move that seemed to defy the very laws of physics, it ripped Birdo's head off and began to mutilate her body.\n\n\n\nBrandon's stomach turned, bile rising in his throat, but he couldn't look away. The creature was feeding off their fear, growing stronger with each second that ticked by. \"We can't let it win,\" Mike shouted over the cacophony of the game's twisted sounds. They had to find a way to break the game's hold on reality, to banish the monster back to the hellish code it came from.\n\n\n\nThe room grew colder, the walls closing in around them as the demonic Mario opened its mouth wider than any creature could. It devoured Birdo's head with a wet, crunching sound that seemed to echo in Brandon's very soul. The TV screen flickered again, and for a moment, he swore he saw the real world bleed through, a glimpse of a world where the game's evil had no power.\n\n\n\nWith newfound strength, Brandon and Mike redoubled their efforts, attacking the creature with everything they had. They dodged, they jumped, they fought with a unity that had been forged in terror. The beast roared, its pixels stretching and distorting, a digital monstrosity that threatened to consume them whole.\n\n\n\nBut then, something changed. The creature staggered, a glitch in its otherwise flawless movements. \"We're doing it,\" Brandon yelled, hope sparking in his voice. \"We're going to beat this thing!\"\n\n\n\nThe room grew brighter, the walls of the apartment fading away to reveal the cold, digital emptiness of the game's code. They had pushed it to its limits, and now they had to finish it. With one final, desperate leap, they struck the creature's core, and it shattered into a million pixels that swirled around them like a tornado of despair.\n\n\n\nThe world grew quiet, the TV screen fading to black. The room felt empty, the power of the game dissipating like a bad dream. They had won, but at what cost? The nightmare wasn't over\u2014it was just beginning to reveal its true form.\n\n\n\nLater that year, Brandon received the news that Mike had died suddenly from a heart attack. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a tragic coincidence. The demonic Mario's final taunt echoed in his mind\u2014a chilling reminder of the digital world that had bled into their lives. The game had claimed its first victim, and he knew he was next.\n\n\n\nThe apartment remained untouched, the TV a silent sentinel to the horrors they had faced. Brandon couldn't bring himself to play another Mario game, the thought of the digital hell they had encountered still too fresh in his memory. He tried to bury the fear, to convince himself it was all in his head. But the whispers of the game, the faint echoes of that twisted music, never truly left him."},"9":{"title":"I Found an Old Copy of Super Mario Bros at a Garage Sale","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkxl9v\/i_found_an_old_copy_of_super_mario_bros_at_a\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"\"Hey, check out what I found at the garage sale,\" Brandon exclaimed, holding up an old, dusty NES cartridge. The label read \"Super Mario Bros.\" in faded letters, the edges worn with age. His friend Mike looked up from the couch, curiosity lighting his eyes. \"Is that the original?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, man, can you believe it? Only five bucks!\" Brandon wiped the dust off on his shirt and blew into the cartridge before sliding it into his retro gaming setup. The TV screen flickered to life, filling the room with the familiar jingle of the Nintendo start-up screen. \"I can't wait to show you the secret warp zones.\"\n\n\n\nThey settled in, controllers in hand, and Brandon booted up the game. The Mushroom Kingdom unfolded before them in glorious 8-bit splendor, the nostalgia thick as pea soup. They spent hours jumping on Goombas and dodging fireballs, the laughter and shouts of victory echoing through the apartment. It was a perfect throwback to their childhood.\n\n\n\nAs they approached Bowser's castle, Brandon felt a strange tingle in the air, like the buzz of static electricity. The screen flickered and for a moment, it seemed as if Mario's pixelated eyes met his. Mike barely had time to react before the game froze, the music cutting out abruptly. The room fell silent, save for the soft hum of the TV. \"What the hell?\" Brandon murmured, his thumb hovering over the reset button. Before he could press it, the screen flashed again, and Mario's iconic character turned to face them, a twisted smile spreading across his digital features.\n\n\n\n\"Your... Next,\" the game announced in a deep, unnatural voice that sent shivers down their spines. The game resumed, but the castle walls were now pulsing with an eerie, red light. The music had changed, the cheerful tune replaced by a sinister melody that echoed through the room. The graphics grew more menacing, the bricks of the castle shifting and moving like living entities.\n\n\n\nBrandon's heart pounded as they reached the final boss fight. Bowser roared, and without warning, the screen flickered once more. This time, instead of the usual battle, the scene shifted to show Mario stepping through the television screen. The plumber's digital form grew larger, his eyes burning with a fiery intensity that seemed to pierce the very fabric of reality.\n\n\n\n\"You think you can kill me?\" the demonic Mario taunted, his voice echoing in their ears. Mike stumbled back, dropping his controller. \"What the\u2014\"\n\n\n\nPanic surged through Brandon's veins. He bolted to his feet, knocking over his chair, and sprinted to the kitchen. His hand trembled as he pulled open the drawer, his eyes locking on the handgun he kept for emergencies. This had to be some sort of prank, some messed-up glitch. But as he heard the sound of digital footsteps approaching, the cold metal of the gun in his hand felt all too real.\n\n\n\nHe turned, pointing the weapon at the advancing figure. \"Get back!\" he yelled, his voice shaking.\n\n\n\nMario took another step, his smile twisted into a snarl. \"You think you can stop me?\" He raised a glowing fist.\n\n\n\nWithout hesitation, Brandon pulled the trigger. The gunshot rang through the apartment, and for a moment, everything was still. But then, the figure before him grew larger, more terrifying. The bullet passed right through the digital monstrosity, embedding itself in the wall behind.\n\n\n\n\"You're part of the game now,\" the demonic voice whispered, the room growing colder. \"And you can never leave.\"\n\n\n\nBrandon's heart raced as he took aim again, firing wildly at the advancing figure. Each shot seemed to only fuel the creature's power, the walls of the room crackling and distorting around them as if the very fabric of reality was being torn apart by the game's malevolent influence. The bullets ricocheted off the floor, sending sparks flying and leaving smoldering craters in their wake.\n\n\n\nMike had backed away, eyes wide with horror, unable to find his voice. \"B-Brandon, what are we going to do?\" he stuttered.\n\n\n\nThe digital demon took another step, now standing in the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. The air grew thick with the scent of burning plastic, and the once-familiar sounds of the game had been replaced by a cacophony of unsettling digital noises\u2014like the cries of a thousand trapped souls.\n\n\n\n\"We have to get out of here,\" Brandon said through gritted teeth, his voice steady despite the fear gripping him. \"Now.\" He took a deep breath and set his jaw, his eyes never leaving the monstrous version of his childhood hero. \"I'm going to reset the console, and when I do, you run.\"\n\n\n\nMike nodded, his eyes darting to the door, calculating their escape. As Brandon took aim at the power strip, his hand hovering over the switch, the creature grew bolder. \"You cannot escape me,\" it hissed, its voice now a chorus of tortured cries.\n\n\n\nIn one swift motion, Brandon fired at the power strip, shattering the plastic and sending a shower of sparks across the floor. The TV flickered off, the demonic figure vanishing in a burst of static. The room fell dark, save for the flickering of the emergency lights that kicked in, casting an eerie glow on the smoke-filled room.\n\n\n\nThey bolted out the door, not looking back, their footsteps echoing down the hallway. The apartment complex was eerily quiet, as if the world had stopped to watch their terrifying ordeal. They didn't stop running until they were outside, gulping in lungfuls of fresh air. The cool evening breeze washed over them, a stark contrast to the hellish scene they'd just escaped.\n\n\n\nPanting, Brandon turned to Mike, the gravity of the situation setting in. \"What the hell was that?\"\n\n\n\nMike's face was ashen. \"I don't know,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"But we're not going back in there.\"\n\n\n\nThe silence between them was heavy with unspoken fear. They had stumbled into something far beyond their understanding, a nightmare born from pixels and nostalgia. As they stood there, the distant sound of the TV turning on echoed through the apartment, the game's eerie theme music playing once more, louder than ever. The digital world had bled into their reality, and it wasn't finished with them yet.\n\n\n\n\"We've got to find a way to stop this,\" Brandon said, his voice firm with determination. Mike nodded in agreement, the gravity of their situation setting in. They couldn't just leave it like this. The game had to be destroyed before it could claim more victims.\n\n\n\nThey re-entered the apartment, the gun still clutched tightly in Brandon's hand. The living room was a mess, with a bullet-riddled wall and a smoking power strip, but the game continued to play on the screen, the demonic Mario nowhere to be seen. Brandon approached the TV, his eyes narrowed in concentration. He had to find a way to end this, to banish the creature back into the hellish game world from where it came.\n\n\n\nHe slammed the cartridge out of the console, the screen flickering briefly before the game's hold on their world weakened. But the moment of relief was short-lived as the wallpaper began to ripple and distort, the floorboards beneath them groaning. It was as if the game itself was fighting back, refusing to let go.\n\n\n\n\"The cartridge,\" Mike said, his voice urgent. \"We need to break it.\"\n\n\n\nThey hurried back to the kitchen, the digital whispers of the game following them like a malevolent shadow. Brandon grabbed a hammer from a drawer, and together, they returned to the living room, ready to face whatever horrors the game had in store. The cartridge lay on the floor, the source of the disturbance, and as Brandon raised the hammer, he could feel the power of the game pushing back, trying to keep its grip on reality.\n\n\n\nWith a mighty swing, he brought the hammer down on the cartridge. The plastic shattered, and with it, the wallpaper snapped back into place, the floor stilled. The TV screen went black, the music cut off mid-note. The room felt normal again, the air no longer thick with the scent of burning plastic and fear.

My paternal grandfather was a former soldier in the Thai army, a man scarred by war, who emigrated to Mexico shortly after the end of World War II. He brought with him not only visible scars, but also a trunk full of memories, some heroic and others deeply disturbing.\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with Thailand's role during this period, it's important to know that the country, then known as Siam, was initially invaded by Japan in late 1941. Shortly thereafter, under pressure and for political expediency, it became an ally of the Japanese Empire. Although many Thais opposed this alliance, the official government collaborated with the Japanese, leading soldiers like my grandfather to participate in military campaigns throughout Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nDuring my childhood, my grandfather told me stories from those turbulent years. Some were tales of camaraderie on the front lines, others were darker, shrouded in mystery. But among them all, there was one in particular that always sent shivers down my spine: the story of the so-called \"dream experiment.\"\r\n\r\nHe claimed that during the war, certain high-ranking officers in the Japanese military, obsessed with mind control and human endurance\u2014specifically, the search for a way for soldiers on the front lines to endure days, even months, without sleep without consequences, in order to lead the rising sun to victory in its war of attrition across Asia\u2014conducted clandestine experiments on soldiers and prisoners. According to him, one of these experiments involved keeping subjects awake for days, even weeks, using chemical stimulants and extreme psychological pressure. The intention was to study the effects of sleep deprivation on the human mind and, more obscurely, to find ways to manipulate it.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather was assigned to a remote facility in the Thai jungle, described as a gigantic bunker built using slave labor from prisoners from all Asian countries under Japanese control at the time.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather played the role of guard in the depths of the facility, passing from the beautiful blues of the sky to the rocky cement chiseled by the hands of the dying.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn collaboration with some of the most brilliant\u2014or perhaps most ruthless\u2014minds in Japan and Thailand, those experiments were carried out under a cloak of absolute secrecy. My grandfather, despite his rank and training, was nothing more than a shadow in that place, a soldier with clear orders: obey, watch, remain silent.\r\n\r\nHe often confessed to me that he didn't understand half of what the scientists around him were saying. They spoke in codes, in mixed languages, with medical jargon that sounded like science fiction to a man raised in a rural village. Yet, amid all that cryptic muttering, there were words that were repeated with disturbing clarity: \"torture,\" \"resistance,\" \"kill.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cThose didn't need any translation,\u201d he said with a bitter smile, lighting a cigarette with trembling hands. \u201cThose words... we all understood them.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeyond the fog of ignorance imposed by military secrecy, my grandfather was certain that what was happening there wasn't simply scientific research. It wasn't just a matter of studying the effects of sleep deprivation. It went much further. Some of the subjects subjected to the experiment weren't even enemy soldiers; they were civilians, political prisoners, even deserters from their own army. Humanity was blurred in that place. The enemy wasn't outside, but locked in dark rooms, their eyes wide open for days on end, until their minds broke.\r\n\r\nThis fragment is powerful and dark, with a strong tone that highlights the horror of the events. Below, I've expanded on it while maintaining that disturbing focus, developing the emotional, visual, and narrative atmosphere, and reinforcing the narrator's voice:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen Subject 302 arrived.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't a soldier, nor a man hardened by war. She was a child. My grandfather, his face hardened by age and memory, always referred to her as such: a Filipino girl, perhaps no more than twelve years old, though no one could be sure. Her tangled hair fell over a face consumed by fear and hunger. She shuffled clumsily, her arms twirling erratically, as if she were waging an invisible struggle against something only she could see.\r\n\r\nShe screamed in her own language, one that neither my grandfather nor the guards understood. But there was no need to translate her gestures: she bit, she scratched, she writhed like a wild animal surrounded by predators. But no amount of resistance prevented her from being unceremoniously thrown into Cell 20, right across from where my grandfather stood guard during most of his routine shift.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat cell was always empty,\u201d he once told me, his gaze lost in space. \u201cBut the moment she walked in there, it was like it was her perfect place. It sounds cruel, but... it was like they complemented each other perfectly. It's hard for me to emphasize what I'm trying to say, the truth... I think it's something you have to see to understand...\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter her arrival, my grandfather couldn't sleep, even though he was outside the experiment. Every time he closed his eyes, he heard the girl's dull knocking against the padded walls, her nails scraping the rusty metal of the door, and a barely audible murmur that seemed to repeat the same word over and over. No one else could hear it. Only him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt said my name,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to me. \u201cAlthough I never told him, I think... it was because of something they were force-fed... I never asked what it was, although I'm honestly sure that if I did, they'd probably hit me in the stomach with a rifle butt for sticking my nose where it didn't belong, like they did to so many others.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis fragment adds a deeply human and tragic emotional dimension to the story. Your grandfather's internal struggle between obedience and feeling, between duty and compassion, makes him a complex and real character. Below, I've edited and integrated it into the narrative, expanding its psychological and narrative depth while respecting the somber, confessional tone:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy grandfather tried to dehumanize her.\r\n\r\nDay after day, as he stood in front of Cell 20, he forced himself not to think about what was in there. Not about who was in there. He wanted to convince himself that that little girl was nothing more than a number, a tool, one experiment among many. A necessary evil, an expendable cog in the machine of supremacy that Thailand and its Japanese allies were seeking to build.\r\n\r\nForget her circumstances. Erase her face. Ignore that, behind those bars, lived a little girl who, every day, descended into hells that would have made even Dante tremble.\r\n\r\nBut my grandfather was human.\r\n\r\nA human being who suffered in silence for the pain of others, even though his hands were tied by obedience, hierarchy, and fear. Every night, as he returned to his bunk, he felt further from himself. He had stopped writing in his journal. He had stopped praying. He had stopped sleeping. The one thing he couldn't stop doing... was looking into those eyes on the other side of the steel.\r\n\r\nHe confessed through tears:\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear I thought about killing her myself. Walking into her cell... and giving her peace.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. His voice broke. I didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I didn't have the courage. I just stood my ground. Like a coward.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes, already worn by time, filled with a moisture I'd never seen before. It wasn't guilt that consumed him, but the constant reminder of a decision he'd never made.\r\n\r\nThat was my grandfather's hell: not being the executioner... nor the savior.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis new fragment further enriches the story's dark and claustrophobic tone by introducing a sinister and ambiguous figure: Doctor T., whose anonymity and scientific obsession accentuate the dehumanization of the experiment. I then worked on it to seamlessly integrate it with the rest of the narrative, amplifying its emotional and visual impact:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen he arrived.\r\n\r\nDr. T.\r\n\r\nNo one knew his name. He wasn't on any official list, and his rank, if he had one, was never mentioned aloud. He was a ghost in a white coat, surrounded by a reverent silence that even the most senior officers dared not break. His presence imposed more than authority: it imposed fear. And with him came the syringes.\r\n\r\nSyringes containing a blue liquid.\r\n\r\nNot just any blue. It was a shade so dark, so dense, that it seemed on the verge of turning black, but it held back just short of the abyss, as if the color itself knew that crossing that threshold would be a point of no return. Just looking at them provoked a feeling of unease. Something about that color wasn't natural.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Subject 302 stopped being simply a prisoner and became the center of the most ambitious experiment in that hell.\r\n\r\nAccording to the scientists, she was a success. Apparently, she resisted the effects of induced insomnia better than any other subject. She didn't delirious as quickly, her body remained standing, her brain... responded. But in my grandfather's eyes, the opposite was happening: every day, the girl seemed more wasted, emptier, as if something inside her was slowly fading away, leaving behind an ever-thinner shell.\r\n\r\nDoctor T. believed, with almost religious faith, that the key lay in the repeated administration of that blue fluid. \u201cAmplification of neuroplasticity induced by prolonged stress,\u201d some murmured, repeating his theories. \u201cAbsolute resistance to mental exhaustion,\u201d others said. But no one could ignore what was happening in Cell 20: the girl was no longer screaming, no longer writhing. She was just there, her eyes wide open, fixed on an invisible point, as if she were seeing something that no longer belonged to this world.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather couldn't stop looking.\r\n\r\nAnd the blue of the syringes... it made him nauseous every time he looked at them.\r\n\r\nExcellent, you continue to build a disturbing and oppressive atmosphere, with a narrative rhythm that evokes psychological horror and mystery. I've integrated your new fragment with a more immersive narrative consistent with the previous tone, adding sensory details, emotional tension, and an intensification of the enigma:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd then one day, cell 20 was empty.\r\n\r\nNo one gave any official explanations, of course. All my grandfather learned came through whispers, whispers between soldiers who knew too much and wanted to say as little as possible. The little that was repeated over and over was a single name: Doctor T.\r\n\r\nApparently, the doctor had obtained results \u201cpromising enough\u201d to warrant moving him to a new section of the complex. An even more restricted area, hidden deep underground. From what my grandfather could gather from the snatches of conversations and nervous glances, that cell had been under construction for weeks, designed specifically for 302. It wasn't just a cell. It was a containment and observation environment, created for what Doctor T. called \u201cthe next phase.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd with that phase, more syringes arrived. More blue.\r\n\r\nSoldiers walked back and forth through the newly opened corridor in the oldest wing of the building. Always silent, their faces pale, carrying steel trays covered with white cloths that concealed the needles. Absolutely no one spoke of what was happening behind that new door.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather tried to request a transfer, even offering an alibi to be switched guards. He was ignored. So, night after night, he simply patrolled the same halls, now emptier than ever, the echoing footsteps the only reminder that he was still alive. The girl's absence brought no relief.\r\n\r\nJust more questions. And a deeper silence.\r\n\r\n1945.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJapan and its allies were beginning to face significant setbacks at the front. Promises of supremacy, fueled by propaganda, began to crumble under the weight of reality. Offensives stalled, resources dwindled, and morale crumbled like a house of cards exposed to the rain.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of all this, the supposed \u201csuccesses\u201d of the experiments meant nothing.\r\n\r\nThere were no super soldiers. No reproducible medical advances. No miracles. Only rumors. 302's name no longer appeared in the reports. Nor was much known about Doctor T. It was as if both had been swallowed by the bowels of the facility, by that forbidden section only certain scientists and highest-ranking officers could access. No one knew for sure what was happening down there. They only knew that more syringes kept coming in, more doses of that abysmal blue.\r\n\r\nOne day, one of the soldiers\u2014a close friend of my grandfather\u2014made a comment while they were smoking behind the watchtower:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say the doctor doesn't come out anymore. He lives down there. In a cell identical to the girl's. Door to door.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy grandfather didn't respond. He just gritted his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe thought disturbed him more than any other. It wasn't just the loss of scientific control. It wasn't just the official silence. It was the image of this supposedly brilliant man voluntarily locking himself away with his experiment... as if he could no longer exist without it.\r\n\r\nThe facility felt increasingly dead, the hallways filled with a sour smell, and the soldiers' faces were pale and tense, as if they all knew something was happening deep down... but no one dared to put a name to it.\r\n\r\nPreviously, 302 was given a supply of food necessary to keep her alive, but for months now, she hasn't received any food, only syringes.\r\n\r\nHow can such a small girl go so long without eating and still be alive?\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was going on with Doctor T?\r\n\r\nPerfect, this section introduces a dramatic turning point. The alarms and immediate reaction lead to an intense, tension-filled climax. Below, I've expanded and polished your excerpt to bring it to the peak of suspense, taking care with the language, setting, and pacing:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe alarms broke the silence.\r\n\r\nA persistent, metallic screech spread throughout the complex, echoing through the narrow corridors and shaking the walls. My grandfather leaped to his feet, yanking his boots on the fly as he grabbed his rifle from the corner where he rested it every night. Within seconds, the corridor was filled with soldiers running in opposite directions, some shouting orders, others simply looking for someone to obey.\r\n\r\nThere was no clear protocol for that kind of alarm. It wasn't a drill. It wasn't an air raid. Something\u2014something inside the complex\u2014had gone terribly wrong.\r\n\r\nA makeshift platoon was formed, a patrol hastily assembled from those available. My grandfather was one of the first to join. No one knew exactly where they were supposed to go, but everyone understood that the epicenter was the restricted wing\u2026 the deepest part of the complex, the one where Doctor T. had buried himself alongside Subject 302.\r\n\r\nThe air grew heavier as they approached. The blue of the emergency lights cast a ghostly hue over the walls, as if the complex itself were bleeding into another color. An officer shouted at them that no one should act without his signal, but it was too late for order.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the underground level's hatches, one of them was hanging broken from its hinges, as if something inside had pushed against it with tremendous force. There were no signs of an explosion, no trace of machinery. Only raw violence. Primitive.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as they peered into the flashing hallway, they knew: it wasn't an escape. It wasn't a riot. It was something else.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather dropped the rifle from his hands.\r\n\r\nHe didn't throw it away. He didn't let go of it in a gesture of surrender. What was before him simply left him in such a state of shock that his body stopped obeying him. As if, for a moment, he had become just another spectator; perhaps then he could be sure of what he was witnessing.\r\n\r\nThe metal of the gun hit the ground with a hollow sound, but my grandfather barely heard it. Everything had become distant. Unreal. As if the world were submerged under a thick layer of icy water. The screams, the alarms, the erratic gunfire... everything was drowned out by the veil of absolute fear.\r\n\r\nAnd there he was, standing, empty-handed, his gaze fixed on something he dared not name.\r\n\r\nBecause what was in front of him was not human.\r\nAnd because, deep down, he feared that he wasn't entirely inhuman either.\r\n\r\nA man to his right vomited his food onto my grandfather's boots, his feet wrapped in an orange mass that stank sourly, you could tell his stomach had been filled with orange juice and some meat broth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t even a woman, she was a mass of flesh with hundreds of vaginas opening and closing their lips, I think that was how she breathed, or perhaps her attempt at speech, each of those holes excreted a gurgling noise , and spat out a blue liquid, that shitty blue...\u201d My grandfather gargled. \u201cThe smell, the smell was indecipherable, the shit from the guts of a decomposing corpse would seem sweet in comparison, she walked on five long, deformed arms, also infested with vaginas, she advanced with them, slowly, she was like a newborn trying to stand on its two legs, the ground was flooded with that abysmal blue substance, I began to feel my pants full of urine, the smell reached the deepest part of my nostrils and even so I could not suppress the smell of that other thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom one of the vaginas, the largest of all, a fleshy lump began to emerge. My grandfather describes it as like watching a birth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were one, the girl and Dr. T. were thrown out of that thing like a giant fetus covered in placenta.\r\n\r\nA placenta of that shitty blue color. Instead of life, a placenta that grew the opposite; it was a mockery of nature, of everything good in this world; it was disgust itself incarnated in tangible form.\r\n\r\n302 and Dr. T. united in one, wrapped, screaming, they had been reborn, they crawled on the flooded ground, they were a gigantic larva that looked at us with totally dark eyes, black pearls is the word that describes it perfectly, they begged for mercy in a disgusting scream, they begged for death.\r\n\r\nThen my grandfather stopped, he didn't finish his story, he got up from the chair he was sitting in and simply left, leaving me alone.\r\n\r\nDays passed and the subject was not touched upon. I was obviously intrigued, I wanted to know more, but my grandfather didn't want to talk.\r\n\r\nAnd I respected his silence.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed. Then months.\r\n\r\nBut the intrigue remained, like a splinter stuck under my skin. A constant murmur at the back of my mind, impossible to ignore. I began searching. To delve. To lose myself in digitized archives, virtual libraries, obscure forums, and pages in languages I had to translate word for word. I dug into every corner of the internet, as if I could unearth a secret buried beneath decades of silence.\r\n\r\nI was looking for one thing: the dream experiment.\r\n\r\nI encountered horrors. True stories of prison camps, of inhumane experiments carried out by the Japanese in China, by the Nazis in Europe, by the Americans in their own shadows. I found names like Unit 731, Auschwitz, Fort Detrick \u2026 I read testimonies so detailed and cruel that they forced me to look away from the screen, close the computer, and remain silent, my stomach churning and my palms sweating.\r\n\r\nBut about the sleep experiment in Thailand\u2026 nothing.\r\n\r\nNot a single document. Not a single mention. Not a whisper in official records.\r\n\r\nIt was as if he had never existed. As if everything my grandfather told me had been a shared nightmare between him\u2026 and me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut the terror I saw on the old man's face convinced me that this was real, not a fictional story, this was real.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my search came to a standstill.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather's diary was found years after his death, hidden between the hollow floorboards of his old house in Veracruz. My mother discovered it while trying to repair a leak. She skimmed it briefly, didn't understand much, and handed it to me with the same indifference with which one hands over a worthless object. \"It's all war stuff, you won't want to read it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI read it all night.\r\n\r\nEach page was written in shaky handwriting, as if the hand that drew it were struggling against something invisible. Some pages were stained. Others had fingernail marks on the edges, as if they had been held with desperate strength. And amidst all the memories, the names, the dates, the descriptions\u2026 she always came back.\r\n\r\n302.\r\n\r\nHe never gave her another name. He no longer referred to her as a person. And yet, every line slid with guilt, pain, and shame for having seen\u2026 and done nothing.\r\n\r\nI closed the journal at dawn. The air was thick. I felt like the house no longer belonged to me. As if, upon reading those words, something had been released within the walls. An ancient echo. A pent-up breath.\r\n\r\nToday, I sleep little. I write down what I dream. I close doors I never opened. I find myself thinking about the color blue more than I'd like. And sometimes, just sometimes\u2026 I swear I feel eyes in the darkness, watching me with inhuman patience.\r\n\r\nI think that, in that diary, part of the experiment was somehow overlooked. I think that not only was 302 the only guinea pig, I think that my grandfather and everyone in there were unknowing lab rats, rats with a virus, a virus that infected me.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the experiment was real. Even though I just said I believe it, there's always a seed of doubt.\r\n\r\nI don't know if all this was the delusion of a tired old soldier.\r\n\r\nBut there is something I do know.\r\n\r\nWhen your body has forgotten what sleep is,\r\n\r\nwhen your mind has crossed that line\u2026\r\n\r\nyou don't come back alone anymore.\r\n\r\nIt's like being reborn. Reborn from a morbidly grotesque vagina.\r\n"},"14":{"title":"\u05e9\u05e2\u05ea

Daniel, Josh, and Devan had this tradition: every Friday night they\u2019d meet up, drink a little, joke around, and dare each other to do dumb things. It was harmless \u2014 until the night at the abandoned aquarium.\n\nThe place had been shut down for years after a mysterious power outage fried every system and left hundreds of exotic fish dead. No one talked about it anymore. The place stank of mildew and salt, with shattered glass tanks and faded posters of sea life that no longer existed. It was Devan\u2019s idea to break in. \u201cLet\u2019s find something creepy and post it \u2014 like old school internet horror.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t expect the tanks to still have water in them.\n\nOr fish.\n\nIn the darkest part of the aquarium, they found a single tank humming with blue light. Inside, a single, oily black fish floated motionless. It didn\u2019t look natural \u2014 more like a shadow shaped like a fish, with eyes that didn\u2019t blink. Josh dared Daniel to reach in and grab it.\n\nOf course he did.\n\nDaniel laughed and said, \u201cThis is gonna break the internet,\u201d as he pulled the thing from the water. Devan snapped a photo, the flash catching Daniel\u2019s manic grin, the slick fish writhing in his hand.\n\nHe sent it to Snapchat with a stupid caption:\n\u201cThis is a cursed image, like in 10 seconds or die.\u201d\n\nThat was the last time they saw Daniel.\n\nHis scream came first. Not like he was in pain \u2014 more like he was being unmade. The fish dropped to the floor, and the blue lights flickered. When they turned back to him, Daniel was gone. Just\u2026 gone.\n\nHis phone was still recording. In the background, barely visible through the fish tank glass, something moved.\n\nThey ran. Josh and Devan swore they\u2019d never talk about it again.\n\nBut the photo kept resurfacing.\n\nPeople on their contact lists started getting it \u2014 even ones they didn\u2019t remember adding. Each time it was clearer, sharper. Daniel\u2019s face started to change in it. His eyes were wider. His mouth stretched inhumanly. And there was always the same caption:\n\n\u201cThis is a cursed image, like in 10 seconds or die.\u201d\n\nThen the disappearances began.\n\nJosh vanished on a Monday. Devan tried to delete every file he had. Smashed his phone. Burned the SD cards. Didn\u2019t matter. The image showed up on his bathroom mirror that night, drawn in condensation:\n\n10 seconds.\n\nThey found him curled in a ball by his tub, eyes wide open, face frozen in silent terror.\n\nThe authorities called it a breakdown. But we know better.\n\nNow the image is online. People repost it for laughs.\n\nIf you see it, don\u2019t save it. Don\u2019t screenshot.

At that time, I was 18 years old and preparing for my driving test. A few months earlier, I had applied for a driver\u2019s license and was taking driving lessons.\n\nAs far as I remember, the person who was teaching me had a private car; this car also had a brake on the passenger side. During the second lesson, I drove more in the city. Our last lesson was a mix of everything, focusing mostly on parking.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the instructor\u2019s name, but he was a really good person; relaxed, calm, and a great teacher. The lesson started around 4 p.m. We drove on a few different roads and went over some things. I don\u2019t remember too many details, but by around 6 p.m., the sun had started setting, and it was getting dark.\n\nThen, we went to a parking lot. The instructor told me to park the car, and then he got out and took out some cheap, small orange cones. He placed them like parking lines. He then got back in the car, and we started the parking exercise.\n\nThe area wasn\u2019t very big, but there was enough space to practice. While I was starting the parking exercise, a car came from the road and entered the same parking lot. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it because it came from the other end of the lot. The car parked at a distant spot. I continued with my parking practice and didn\u2019t focus on that car. No one got out of it, and it stayed there.\n\nA few minutes later, another car arrived. It parked near the first car but a little closer to us. The instructor muttered something like, \u201cI wonder what these people are doing here.\u201d It was strange for people to park in a lot like this at that hour. We had specifically come here because I thought it would be empty, at least that\u2019s what I assumed. Still, I focused on my parking.\n\nI thought parking would be the hardest part for me. At that moment, one of the cars that had arrived earlier suddenly started backing up. At first, I thought it was just passing by, but after I had parked, the car came right behind us and stopped just a few meters away. It stayed there for about a minute, not moving at all.\n\nThe instructor told me to stay in the car while he tried to figure out what was going on. I didn\u2019t look at him, just stared ahead and waited for him to return. Suddenly, my instructor came back unexpectedly and quickly. He was in a panic and immediately told me to leave the parking lot. I told him we hadn\u2019t picked up the cones, but he said it didn\u2019t matter. It was clear he was nervous.\n\nI started the car and we drove out of the parking lot. The car behind us followed us out. The instructor told me not to panic. When he got close to the vehicle, he noticed a gun and quickly returned to our car. At that moment, the other car also started following us.\n\nThe instructor told me to drive to the nearest police station, not to speed, and to stay calm. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the police station, but it felt like hours. Both cars followed us along the way but didn\u2019t overtake us or do anything else.\n\nFinally, when we reached the police station, I drove the car inside, and they continued on their way. I parked the car, and we went inside to report the incident. I was so happy to have made it out safely. I passed the driving test on my first try, but I\u2019ll never forget this experience.\n\n# [Check out more True Car Driving Horror Stories](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XwUd41vS8zE&t=276s)"},"21":{"title":"Sometimes i wonder if these are meant to be creepypastas or somthing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kklh43\/sometimes_i_wonder_if_these_are_meant_to_be\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"traumatisedonion","selftext":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/hq-BXz3M6cE?si=UNoD5wQxMb1YPXI0\n\nThere's lots of those reddit story shorts but the ones that are like 'my grandmother lost her dentures and now I have a magical ability' make me wonder weather some are meant to be creepypastas or somthing like that.

The Beast of Gevaudan, an unknown and bloodthirsty creature, was responsible for a trail of violent deaths in an isolated region, amid the dark forests of Gevaudan. However, what many don't know is that she was never truly defeated. The beast is still among us. And, in the dead of night, she returns.\n\nIt all started in 1764, when the first attacks occurred. At first it was seen as just a beast, perhaps a direwolf, but it soon became clear that its nature was much darker. Its victims were found torn to pieces, with the flesh torn from their bones, as if the creature fed on something other than mere flesh. His eyes were described as human eyes, red and piercing, illuminated by the light of the full moon. However, the true nature of the beast was never understood.\n\nOver the years, many hunters have tried to capture or kill the creature, but they have all failed, disappearing without a trace. Fear spread quickly, but the beast seemed to revel in it, as if it knew that no one would be able to stop its insatiable hunger.\n\nToday, in the 21st century, the myth of the Beast of Gevaudan was just another scary story to tell on stormy nights. But the evil never disappeared. He waited. He grew up. It evolved.\n\nI was just a teenager when my curiosity about the case of the Beast of Gevaudan led me on a journey to the region of southern France. What I found there, however, was not just a legend. I found hell.\n\nIt was on a cold night, while walking along one of the many trails hidden in the dense forest, that I saw her. I saw her at her most horrible. It wasn't a wolf. It was something much worse. A monstrous being, with claws that extended more than a meter, teeth as sharp as sawmill knives, and skin covered in a layer of wet black fur that seemed to absorb the moonlight. His eyes were not red as in the old descriptions. No, the beast's eyes were as black as the abyss, and when it looked at me, it was as if I was being consumed from within, as if my soul was being devoured.\n\nBefore I could react, she attacked.\n\nThe pain was unbearable. His claws cut into my flesh with the precision of a sharp blade, and the feeling of blood gushing from my veins was like a nightmare experienced in the flesh. She dragged me to the ground, and the last thing I saw was her macabre smile, an expression that was not that of an animal, but of something that understood death and pain in a way no creature should.\n\nBut I didn't die. Not completely. Something about the beast transformed me. Something about the poison that coursed through my veins caused me to wake up in an even worse nightmare.\n\nI woke up in a damp cave, shrouded in shadows, with an insatiable hunger that wasn't mine. My body felt strange, distorted. My claws had grown, my teeth now sharp as those of the beast itself. And the most terrifying thing: my eyes, the same black eyes of the creature, reflected back the horror that it was.\n\nNow, I'm the predator. And the hunger never stopped.\n\nI hunt in the shadows, hoping more souls will be lost on the forgotten trails. Every death makes me stronger. Every scream feeds me. The Beast of Gevaudan did not die. She just waited. And now, she will never be defeated again.\n\nIf you are hiking in the forests of Gevaudan, or anywhere in the world, be careful. It's not just a legend. I am always close. I am the Beast.\n\nAnd you, you will be the next victim."},"24":{"title":"Ich fand etwas seltsames an der Ostsee (german)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkb2mm\/ich_fand_etwas_seltsames_an_der_ostsee_german\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"der_sachse95","selftext":"Mein Name ist Olaf und ich bin 36 Jahre alt.

Das ist etwas, was ich genie\u00dfe und was mich aber gleichzeitig sentimental werden l\u00e4sst.\n\nAls es dann langsam dunkel wurde, entschloss ich mich, langsam wieder umzukehren und langsam wieder Richtung meiner Unterkunft zu gehen.\n\nIch hatte einen Fu\u00dfmarsch von etwa 4 km noch vor mir. Ich entschloss mich, bei einem Strandabschnitt, wo etwas Kies lag, diesen noch anzuschauen und zu begutachten, ob etwas f\u00fcr mich dabei ist. Dabei sah ich nur die \u00fcblichen Sachen, von denen ich allerhand schon habe.\n\nIch entschloss mich, das Ganze abzubrechen, und drehte mich um. Auf einmal sah ich etwas. Unter einem anderen Stein sah ich etwas ganz schwach rot leuchten. Ich beugte mich davor, um genauer schauen zu k\u00f6nnen, was das ist. Ich schob den Stein dar\u00fcber beiseite und staunte nicht schlecht.\n\nEs war ein Stein, der perfekt aussah wie ein H\u00fchnerei. Allerdings nicht wei\u00df oder braun, wie man sie meist kennt. Nein, dieser war rot und er schien sogar ein rotes Licht auszustrahlen.\n\nEs war ein schwacher Lichtschein, der von diesem Stein ausging, aber ich hatte so etwas in all den Jahren noch nie gesehen. Ich griff nach dem Stein und erschrak. Er war richtig warm.\n\nSo warm wie Gl\u00fchwein auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt. Wie konnte ein Stein am Meer im Dunkeln so warm sein? Ich meine, in der direkten Sonne w\u00fcrde ich es ja verstehen.\n\nEntweder konnte er enorm gut W\u00e4rme speichern oder es hatte etwas anderes damit auf sich. Wie auch immer.\n\nIch nahm den Stein und legte ihn in meinen Rucksack. In dem Moment war ich mega gl\u00fccklich. Nach Jahren hatte ich etwas gefunden, was ich noch nie gesehen hatte.\n\nIch ging also freudestrahlend zur\u00fcck zu meiner Unterkunft. Am n\u00e4chsten Morgen wollte ich mich morgens gegen 10 Uhr auf die R\u00fcckfahrt machen. Doch an dem Tag ging irgendwie alles schief.\n\nIch h\u00f6rte meinen Wecker nicht, da mein Handy nicht geladen war und deswegen der Akku leer war. Gegen 9 Uhr klingelte der Vermieter der Unterkunft f\u00fcr die R\u00fcckgabe der Schl\u00fcssel.\n\nIch war v\u00f6llig erschrocken und war dadurch wie benebelt. Ich konnte alles kl\u00e4ren und ging danach noch in das Caf\u00e9, wo ich die Woche immer hingegangen war, um wenigstens etwas zu fr\u00fchst\u00fccken, einen Kaffee zu trinken und mein Handy laden zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAls die Bedienung an mir vorbeiging, stolperte sie auf einmal und mir fiel das gesamte Essen, welches auf dem Tablet war, auf den R\u00fccken. Nat\u00fcrlich hatte ich ein wei\u00dfes Hemd an. Sie entschuldigte sich mehrfach und es war ihr sehr unangenehm.\n\nIch nahm es aber mit Humor und sagte ihr, dass es wohl heute nicht mein Tag ist. Sie wollte erst, dass ich f\u00fcr mein Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck nichts bezahlen m\u00fcsse, doch das lehnte ich ab. Es war kein teures Hemd und ich habe noch mehr als genug in meinem Schrank.\n\nSie brachte mir aber noch einen Kaffee und den nahm ich dann doch an. Ich verabschiedete mich und machte mich auf den Weg zu meinem Auto. Ich nahm mir aus meinem Koffer ein anderes Hemd und zog dieses an.\n\nDanach setzte ich mich dann ans Steuer und fuhr los. Doch meine Pechstr\u00e4hne ging weiter. Nach etwa 200 m wurde mein Auto auf einmal laut und ich h\u00f6rte etwas schleifen. Ich hielt an und schaute nach. Mein Auspuff war abgefallen und hing nur noch an einer Schelle.\n\nGl\u00fccklicherweise war eine Autowerkstatt in 600 m sichtbar. Ich fuhr langsam noch zu dieser und der Werkstattmeister bot mir an, den Auspuff wieder anzuschwei\u00dfen und zu sichern, damit ich ohne Probleme bis nach Hause komme und es dann bei mir richtig reparieren lasse.\n\nEr brauchte eine halbe Stunde daf\u00fcr, und als ich nach dem Preis fragte, sagte er, ich sollte nur was f\u00fcr die Kaffeekasse dalassen. Ich tat ihm 30 Euro da rein, da er mir den Arsch gerettet hatte.\n\nDa war sehr gl\u00fccklich dar\u00fcber. Ich stieg in mein Auto und dachte, dass es doch jetzt mal gut sein m\u00fcsste mit dem Pech. Und tats\u00e4chlich passierte eine Stunde erstmal gar nichts. Ich war auf der Autobahn und da kam der erste Stau.\n\nGut, sowas kann in der Ferienzeit durchaus passieren. Ich fuhr eine halbe Stunde im Stau, wobei es eher ein Stop-and-go war. Bei meinem Radio wurde auf einmal der Empfang schlecht und ich versuchte, einen anderen Sender zu finden. Dadurch merkte ich nicht, dass der vor mir stark bremste, und ich rollte ihm mit etwa 10 km\/h auf sein Fahrzeug.\n\nIch erschrak total und regte mich kurz \u00fcber meine eigene Bl\u00f6dheit auf. Ich stieg aus und redete kurz mit dem anderen Fahrer, und wir beide entschlossen uns, r\u00fcber auf den Standstreifen zu wechseln. Die anderen lie\u00dfen uns passieren, und auf dem Standstreifen kl\u00e4rten wir das Ganze und tauschten die Versicherungsdaten aus.\n\nIch sicherte ihm zu, dass ich der Verursacher war und alles an Schaden \u00fcbernehmen werde. Ich sagte dann zu ihm, dass wir ja dann weiterfahren k\u00f6nnten. Da zeigte er auf mein Auto und meinte, dass ich so nicht fahren k\u00f6nnte.\n\nEr hatte recht. Meine Sto\u00dfstange war halb ab und lag auf der linken Seite auf der Stra\u00dfe auf. Ich dachte, das kann doch alles nicht wahr sein. Er sagte zu mir, dass er noch Panzertape h\u00e4tte und wir sie schnell Hochkleben k\u00f6nnten. Ich bedankte mich und wir legten los. Tats\u00e4chlich haben wir das gut hinbekommen, obwohl das Ergebnis schon ziemlich speziell aussah.\n\nIch machte mich dann wieder auf den Weg und hatte auf der R\u00fcckfahrt noch einen gro\u00dfen Stau und wurde tats\u00e4chlich 2-mal geblitzt. Mein letzter Blitzer davor ist 10 Jahre her.\n\nIch sage ja, das war absolut nicht mein Tag. Abends kam ich dann zu Hause an, r\u00e4umte mein Auto aus und legte mich danach ins Bett. Ich war fertig von dem Tag. In dieser Nacht passierte Gott sei Dank auch nichts weiter.\n\nAm n\u00e4chsten Morgen wachte ich auf und rief meine Versicherung an wegen des Unfalls. Die freundliche Dame an der anderen Leitung erkl\u00e4rte mir aber, dass sie aufgrund eines Datenfehlers diesen Unfall nicht \u00fcbernehmen w\u00fcrden. Ich dachte, das kann doch nicht wahr sein, und schaute in meinen Unterlagen.\n\nLaut diesen war alles richtig und die Versicherung m\u00fcsste zahlen. Ich entschloss mich aber, mich nochmal abzusichern, und machte einen Termin mit einem befreundeten Anwalt aus. In dieser Woche passierten immer wieder solche Sachen.\n\nMeine Waschmaschine ging kaputt, mein K\u00fchlschrank entschloss sich, nur noch zu heizen statt zu k\u00fchlen. Ich hatte anscheinend richtig die Schei\u00dfe am Schuh.\n\nIn der darauffolgenden Woche bekam ich von meiner Firma gesagt, dass diese zum Monatsende die Produktion einstellt und wir alle leider entlassen werden m\u00fcssten. Man sagte mir, ich sollte bis zum letzten Tag zu Hause bleiben, da sie nicht genug Arbeit f\u00fcr alle h\u00e4tten.\n\nIch war deswegen richtig entt\u00e4uscht und traurig. Ich sa\u00df abends auf dem Sofa und wusste nichts mit mir anzufangen. Da fiel mir auf einmal ein, dass ich den Rucksack vom Urlaub noch gar nicht ausger\u00e4umt hatte, und ich holte diesen ran.\n\nIch packte alles aus und staunte nicht schlecht. Der rot leuchtende Stein. Er schien gr\u00f6\u00dfer geworden zu sein. Auch sein Leuchten wirkte st\u00e4rker. Ich nahm ihn in die Hand und er war tats\u00e4chlich auch schwerer geworden.\n\nVon der W\u00e4rme her war er aber immer noch gleich geblieben. Ich entschloss mich, dieses Prachtst\u00fcck\nauf meine Anbauwand zu legen, damit ich ihn immer wieder sehen konnte. Ich schaute abends noch fern.\n\nAuf einmal bekam mein Fernseher Bildausf\u00e4lle und Pixelfehler. Es konnte doch nicht wahr sein. Nun ging auch noch mein Fernseher kaputt. Ich machte ihn aus und wunderte mich. Ich h\u00f6rte ein leises Rauschen. Es klang wie ein Meeresrauschen. Ich stand auf und merkte, dass dieses Rauschen von meinem Stein kam.\n\nAuch sein rotes Licht war intensiver geworden und er schien in diesem Moment zu wachsen. Das konnte doch nicht sein. Das bilde ich mir nur ein, dachte ich und musste \u00fcber mich selber schmunzeln. Ich entschloss mich, ins Bett zu gehen, und hatte in der Nacht etliche Alptr\u00e4ume.\n\nGegen 4 Uhr wurde ich von einem Ger\u00e4usch geweckt, was sich als ein eingeschlagenes Fenster herausstellte. Ich machte das Licht an und vor mir stand eine maskierte Person. Diese ging auf mich zu und schlug mich mit seiner Taschenlampe k.o.\n\nIch wurde nach etwa 5 Stunden wach und rief die Polizei. Diese nahm den Einbruch auf und ich wurde f\u00fcr Untersuchungen in ein Krankenhaus gebracht. Man untersuchte mich und beim MRT im Krankenhaus wartete die n\u00e4chste Hiobsbotschaft auf mich.\n\nZwar hatte ich keine schwere Verletzung durch die Taschenlampe abbekommen, dennoch fanden die \u00c4rzte etwas sehr Beunruhigendes in meinem Kopf. Sie sahen einen Tumor, welcher in meinem Kopf wuchs.\n\nIch musste deswegen im Krankenhaus f\u00fcr weitere Untersuchungen bleiben. Dabei stellten sie fest, dass er schnell wuchs und mich wahrscheinlich nicht mehr lange am Leben lie\u00df. Eine Operation w\u00fcrde evtl. ein wenig Zeit herausholen, aber es bestand eine gro\u00dfe Gefahr, dass ich danach viele Probleme haben k\u00f6nnte.\n\nWenn es ganz schlimm lief, k\u00f6nnte ich sogar im Rollstuhl sitzen. Ich entschloss mich dagegen und entlie\u00df mich selber. Ich war am Boden zerst\u00f6rt. Danach fuhr ich mit dem Taxi nach Hause und verkroch mich f\u00fcr ein paar Tage.\n\nZu Hause sah ich, dass der Stein wieder gewachsen war und das Licht nun so stark war, dass es im Dunkeln den Raum schon gut ausleuchtet.\n\nIch wollte nicht mehr. Ich wollte weg aus meiner tristen Wohnung und beschloss, meine letzte Reise anzutreten, und machte mich auf den Weg dahin, wo ich immer gl\u00fccklich war.\n\nDaraufhin packte ich meinen Koffer und brachte ihn in mein Auto. Ich setzte mich ans Steuer und wollte gerade losfahren.\n\nDa hatte ich wie eine innere Stimme, die mir sagte, ich solle den Stein mitnehmen. Ich stieg aus und holte ihn. Ich fuhr die ganze Strecke bis zum Ziel durch. Als ich angekommen war, setzte ich mich an den Strand.\n\nIch schaute auf das Meer und konnte meine Tr\u00e4nen nicht zur\u00fcckhalten. Soll das jetzt mein Leben gewesen sein? Soll alles schon vorbei sein?\n\nIch hatte keine Chance mehr. Ich wollte mir aber die letzten Tage so sch\u00f6n wie m\u00f6glich machen. Auch wenn ich merkte, dass in den letzten Tagen meine Kopfschmerzen immer st\u00e4rker wurden und ich teilweise starke Sichtprobleme hatte, welche sich durch Verschwommenheit auszeichnen.\n\nIch ging jeden Tag an den Strand und merkte, wie es mir jeden Tag schlechter ging. Ich merkte, dass meine Zeit gekommen war, und war langsam damit in Reinen. Klar fragt man sich in so einer Situation, warum ich und warum so jung? Aber ich konnte es ja eh nicht mehr \u00e4ndern.\n\nAls ich merkte, dass ich kaum noch laufen konnte, machte ich mich ein letztes Mal auf den Weg zum Strand. Ich brauchte f\u00fcr die Strecke die 5-fache Zeit wie normal.\n\nIch hatte meine 5 liebsten St\u00fccke, welche ich in all den Jahren gesammelt hatte, mitgenommen. Darunter war auch der rote Stein. Ich kam v\u00f6llig ersch\u00f6pft dort an.\n\nEs wurde auch schon dunkel. Ich sa\u00df da und hatte meine Sch\u00e4tze vor mir hingelegt. Auf einmal kam wieder diese innere Stimme, welche zu mir sprach, ich solle den roten Stein ins Meer werfen. Ich dachte, ich werde nun total bescheuert.\n\nAber irgendwie sagte mir mein Gef\u00fchl, ich sollte es machen. Ich nahm ihn in die Hand und stand auf, holte Schwung mit all meiner letzten Kraft und warf ihn so weit, wie ich konnte, ins Meer.\n\nMan h\u00f6rte den Einschlag ins Wasser deutlich. Ich setzte mich wieder hin und auf einmal wurde mir schwarz vor Augen. Beim Umkippen dachte ich nur noch: Das war\u2019s jetzt.\n\nIrgendwann wurde ich auf einmal wach. Ich sah alles verschwommen und wusste nicht, wo ich war. Es war ein wei\u00dfer Raum, das konnte ich erkennen.\n\nNach einigen Minuten wurde meine Sicht deutlicher und ich erkannte, dass ich in einem Krankenhaus lag. Ich war verwundert und freute mich zugleich, dass ich noch lebte.\n\nNach ungef\u00e4hr 10 Minuten kam eine Krankenschwester rein und sah, dass ich wach war. Diese rief sofort einen Arzt. Es war der Arzt, der mich damals wegen des Tumors aufkl\u00e4rte.\n\nIch war verwundert, warum er so fr\u00f6hlich war. Als er mir aber dann die Situation erkl\u00e4rte, konnte ich es verstehen. Ich wurde am Strand von einem Spazierg\u00e4nger gefunden und dieser rief den Notruf.\n\nIch wurde in eine Klinik gebracht und diese lie\u00df mich in meine Heimat verlegen. Man stellte fest, dass mein Tumor im Kopf zu diesem Zeitpunkt h\u00fchnereigro\u00df war, und gab mir nur noch Stunden.\n\nDoch als ich nach 2 Tagen immer noch lebte, schaute man nochmal nach und stellte fest, dass dieser schrumpfte, bis er nach 10 Tagen v\u00f6llig verschwunden war.\n\nMan hatte absolut keine Erkl\u00e4rung daf\u00fcr. Es war ein medizinisches Wunder. Ich wurde aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen und hatte zu Hause in meinem Briefkasten die n\u00e4chste \u00dcberraschung.\n\nMeine Firma hat einen Gro\u00dfauftrag bekommen und ich k\u00f6nnte sofort wieder anfangen. Au\u00dferdem war eine Postkarte drin von der Frau im Caf\u00e9, welche mir damals das Tablet aus Versehen \u00fcbergeworfen hatte.\n\nDiese hatte ewig nach meinen Kontaktdaten gesucht und \u00fcber den Vermieter diese letztendlich bekommen. Sie fragte, ob wir uns mal privat treffen wollen, da sie oft an mich denken musste.\n\nIch freute mich, denn ich fand sie schon immer sehr h\u00fcbsch, traute mich aber nicht, sie nach einem Date zu fragen. Ich freute mich und entschloss mich, mir eine Flasche Sekt zu holen.\n\nDabei entschloss ich mich, spontan noch ein Rubbellos zu kaufen und staunte nicht schlecht. Ich rubbelte es auf und hatte dreimal den gleichen Betrag. Und dieser war 25.000 Euro. Ich hab einfach 25 000 Euro gewonnen.\n\nIch war der gl\u00fccklichste Mensch der Welt. Es lief auf einmal in meinem Leben, und mit Linda, der Bedienung aus dem Caf\u00e9, startete ein neues Kapitel.\n\nIch musste immer wieder an den Stein denken. Ich wei\u00df nicht, was es mit ihm auf sich hatte, aber eins steht fest: Er brachte mir die schlimmste Zeit meines Lebens, aber auch die beste."},"25":{"title":"The Voice In the Rooms ( A Real Reoccurring Dream )","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkcsx3\/the_voice_in_the_rooms_a_real_reoccurring_dream\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"BeraGPT","selftext":"It always begins with a door.\n\nAt first, it seems like any other door. A bedroom door. A hallway door. Once, it was the small wooden door under the stairs in a house I haven\u2019t lived in for years. But somehow, I always know when it\u2019s the door. There\u2019s no real explanation for it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t whisper to me, there\u2019s no sound, no pull. It just opens.\n\nI never open it. I never touch it. The door opens to me \u2014 slowly, quietly, inviting me. No matter where I am in the dream, I could be walking down a hallway, standing in a room, or even just standing still, and the door will appear in front of me, swinging open on its own. It doesn\u2019t creak or make a sound. It simply opens, as though it was waiting for me all along.\n\nAnd I step through.\n\nThe moment I cross the threshold, I\u2019m somewhere else. The place is never the same, but it always feels familiar \u2014 a series of rooms, one after another, leading into each other. Some rooms are like living rooms, others like old offices, some like kitchens or small storage spaces. But they all feel wrong. They don\u2019t belong. The walls hum with a quiet energy, and the air is still, like a room that has been untouched for years.\n\nAnd I\u2019m never alone.\n\nThere are things. Not people. Not quite. But they\u2019re there. I don\u2019t always see them clearly \u2014 they move in the periphery of my vision, fading in and out of existence. Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of a shadow reflected in a piece of glass or hear a faint rustle that doesn\u2019t belong to me. They never speak. They never approach. They just watch. They follow. And the deeper I go into the rooms, the more restless they become. It\u2019s like they\u2019re waiting for me to leave.\n\nBut they never get too close.\n\nThere\u2019s something else in these rooms with me. Something I can\u2019t see, but I feel it.\n\nIt\u2019s a presence. A warmth. It\u2019s always behind me, just out of sight, like someone is standing close to me, just over my shoulder. There\u2019s no face, no body, no figure. Just the feeling of something\u2026 watching, but not with malice. With something like protection. Like guidance.\n\nThis presence speaks to me. Not through whispers or hidden words. I hear it, clear and calm, like a voice in my head. And yet, I know it\u2019s not my own voice. I feel it. It\u2019s there, a comforting voice in the midst of confusion, never panicked, never anxious, always steady:\n\n\u201cTurn back.\u201d \u201cWait. You\u2019re not ready yet.\u201d \u201cGo to the left. Now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a command. It doesn\u2019t force me. But it guides me, always with an undercurrent of something\u2026 warm. I trust it. Because no matter how strange or unsettling everything else feels, this voice brings me peace.\n\nBut as I move deeper into the rooms, I realize something is changing. The air grows colder. The walls seem to close in, pressing around me. The silence that once felt comforting now feels suffocating. I can feel the things watching me more intensely. Their presence is heavier. And their anger starts to grow.\n\nThe deeper I go, the more they react. They move quicker, closer, more violent. At first, it was just shadows and flickers, but now I can feel them in the air, their energy becoming a tangible force, as though they\u2019re trying to push me out. They don\u2019t speak, but I can sense their anger. It\u2019s thick, almost suffocating.\n\nThey want me gone.\n\nIt becomes harder to breathe, harder to think. I feel their presence tightening around me, watching, waiting, like they\u2019re closing in from all sides. And then, as I pass through another door \u2014 a door I don\u2019t remember opening \u2014 I find myself in a room with no way out. Four walls. No windows. No doors. Just the oppressive silence. The weight of it hits me harder than ever before.\n\nAnd they\u2019re there.\n\nTwo figures, standing at the far end of the room. Their shapes are distorted, their forms flickering in and out of existence, but they\u2019re unmistakable. They\u2019re no longer watching me from a distance. They\u2019re standing directly in front of me, blocking my escape. Their faces \u2014 if you can even call them faces \u2014 are twisted in expressions of rage, fear, and something darker.\n\nThey want me out.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else. They\u2019re afraid. I can see it in the way they move. They want to hurt me, I can feel it. They\u2019re angry. But they\u2019re too afraid to get too close. They stay at a distance, glaring at me, their twisted, distorted forms flickering and warping with every move. It\u2019s like they\u2019re terrified of me \u2014 as if something about me is keeping them back, like they can\u2019t touch me, can\u2019t harm me, no matter how much they want to.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it is that frightens them. Maybe they think I\u2019m too powerful. Maybe they think if they get too close, they won\u2019t be able to stop. But whatever it is, it keeps them frozen, seething in their rage but too fearful to act.\n\nI can feel their desperation, their anger growing more intense, more violent. But they won\u2019t move. They won\u2019t approach. I don\u2019t know why, but I understand that whatever is keeping them from me is real.\n\nAnd then, I hear the voice again \u2014 the comforting, guiding voice. It\u2019s not frantic, but there\u2019s a clear urgency behind it now.\n\n\u201cGo. Now. Before it\u2019s too late.\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t hurt you, but you have to leave. You must leave.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t hesitate. I turn and run, and as I do, the door I had passed through appears again, quietly opening. I don\u2019t look back. I don\u2019t want to. I just step through and leave the room behind me, the rage of the beings fading as I escape. The door shuts softly behind me.\n\nBut I know the dream will come again.\n\nThe door will appear. Slowly, quietly, and once again, I\u2019ll feel the pull to step through.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what they want from me. I\u2019m not sure what this place is, or what I\u2019m meant to learn. But I know this: The more I try to ignore the door, the more they push. And every time I step through, the rooms get darker. The beings get angrier."},"26":{"title":"Bendy and the Ink Machine and the Rise of the Ink Demon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kk7kvi\/bendy_and_the_ink_machine_and_the_rise_of_the_ink\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"\"Damn it, why won't this thing start?\" Henry's voice echoed through the cavernous room, bouncing off the cold steel walls of the ancient ink machine. The room was bathed in a sickly green light that flickered from the broken bulbs overhead, casting eerie shadows on the floor. He kicked the rusted contraption in frustration, sending a shower of dust and flakes of paint flying into the stagnant air.\n\n\n\nThe workshop around him looked like it hadn't seen a soul in decades. Tools lay scattered haphazardly on the floor, their metal surfaces coated with a thick film of dust. Shelves groaned under the weight of forgotten sketchbooks and half-used paint tubes, and a thick layer of grime obscured the glass panes of the windows, blocking out any hint of the outside world. Henry's heart raced as he tried to piece together the last moments before he'd blacked out.\n\n\n\nThe silence was deafening, broken only by the distant sound of dripping water that seemed to come from every direction at once. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the metallic scent of the room that made his nose twitch. His hand brushed against something sticky and wet on the floor. He jerked away, his eyes widening in horror as he realized what it was. Ink. Thick, black, and alive, it pooled around his feet like a living shadow, reaching out to him with a sinister intent.\n\n\n\nAs he took a tentative step back, the ink rippled, and a face formed in the fluid. \"Welcome, Henry,\" it said in a guttural growl. \"You're just in time for the show.\" The face morphed into a twisted grin, revealing rows of jagged teeth. The ink began to pulse and swirl, rising up into a monstrous form. It was the Ink Demon, a creature of nightmares made flesh. \"You've been looking for a way out, haven't you?\" it taunted. \"But the only way to leave this place is through me.\"\n\n\n\nThe creature's laughter echoed through the studio, sending a shiver down Henry's spine. He looked around for a weapon, his eyes landing on a discarded wrench. He grabbed it, feeling the cold steel in his grip, and stepped forward to face the demon. The Ink Demon loomed over him, a towering mass of writhing tendrils and malicious eyes that darted around the room. \"You think you can fight me with that?\" it jeered.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the door at the far end of the room burst open, and a group of ragged individuals stumbled in. They were the Believers, survivors like him who had managed to avoid the demon's grasp. Their eyes were wide with fear, but there was also a spark of determination in their gazes. One of them, a young woman with a scarf tied around her head, stepped forward. \"We know what you're planning, Henry,\" she said urgently. \"But you can't fight it alone. We need to stick together.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ink Demon's laugh grew louder, the ink bubbling and churning as it grew more agitated. \"You think your little band of misfits can stop me?\" It lunged at them, tendrils snaking through the air. The Believers moved as one, each of them brandishing their makeshift weapons\u2014pens, paintbrushes, and shards of glass. Henry stepped back, letting the group form a protective barricade around him. He had to admit, they had a plan, a shaky one, but it was better than nothing.\n\n\n\n\"We know the demon's weakness,\" the scarfed woman whispered to him. \"The light from the machine. If we can get it to activate, we might have a chance.\" The group exchanged nods, their eyes shifting to the towering ink machine in the center of the room. The lights around it flickered ominously.\n\n\n\nThey had a plan. Now they just had to execute it without getting consumed by the living nightmare before them. The air grew thick with tension as the battle between hope and darkness began to unfold in the haunted studio.\n\n\n\n\"Quick, to the control panel,\" Henry barked, pointing at a dusty console next to the ink machine. The Believers sprang into action, each one with a clear role to play. The scarfed woman, who introduced herself as Lila, took the lead, her nimble fingers dancing across the ancient switches and dials. The others spread out, ready to distract the demon with their makeshift arsenal of art supplies.\n\n\n\nAs Lila worked, the demon's tendrils shot out like lightning, narrowly missing the survivors. The room was alive with the sound of scraping metal and splattering ink. One of the Believers, a burly man with a paint-splattered apron, hurled a jar of paint at the demon. It exploded on impact, sending a burst of colorful liquid into the creature's eyes. It recoiled, roaring in anger and pain.\n\n\n\nSeizing the moment, Lila hit a switch, and the ink machine roared to life, the lights around it brightening with a pulse. The demon screeched, its form recoiling from the sudden burst of light. \"Now, Henry, now!\" she called out.\n\n\n\nGripping the wrench tightly, Henry took a deep breath and stepped forward, aiming for the glowing core of the demon. With all his strength, he swung at the beast, the metal clanging against the demon's thick, inky skin. The demon's roars grew more desperate as the light from the machine grew brighter.\n\n\n\nThe ink began to boil and retreat, the creature shrinking before their eyes. The Believers pressed their advantage, striking from all angles. The demon thrashed, trying to escape the searing light, but it was too late. With a final, agonized shriek, it dissolved into a pool of thick, black ink.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, the room was still. The only sound was the hiss of the cooling machine and the labored breathing of the survivors. Then, as if on cue, the lights flickered back to life, the shadows retreating. The puddles of ink grew brighter, and Henry felt a strange warmth spread through his body.\n\n\n\nHe looked down to see his own shadow begin to shift and writhe, the ink rising to form the face of the demon again. \"You think you've won?\" it rasped, a hint of fear in its voice. \"This is only the beginning.\"\n\n\n\nThe survivors stared in horror as the demon's shadow grew larger, reaching out to engulf them. Before it could touch them, however, the lights in the room blazed with a brilliant white, and the demon's form dissipated with a scream. The room was bathed in a purifying light that seemed to cleanse the very air of the malevolence that had hung over it.\n\n\n\n\"What's happening?\" someone murmured.\n\n\n\nLila's eyes gleamed with understanding. \"The machine,\" she said, her voice filled with awe. \"It's not just a weapon. It's a doorway to another place, another time.\"\n\n\n\nThe light grew stronger, and the ink began to swirl around the edges of the room, forming a vortex. The survivors looked at each other, unsure whether to flee or embrace the unknown.\n\n\n\n\"This is our chance,\" Henry said, his voice firm. \"We can't let the demon win. We have to go through.\"\n\n\n\nWithout another word, the group stepped into the light, the whirlwind of ink swirling around them. The world outside the studio grew hazy, and the air grew thick with the scent of possibility. As they were drawn into the vortex, they could feel the fabric of reality stretching and bending.\n\n\n\nTheir destination was uncertain, but one thing was clear: their journey through the dark puddles was far from over.\n\n\n\nAs the ink swirled around them, the survivors tightened their grip on each other, their eyes squeezed shut against the blinding light. The sensation of falling washed over Henry, his stomach lurching as the ground beneath his feet disappeared. The wind roared in his ears, and he could feel the warmth of the others' bodies next to his, their breaths coming in short, panicked gasps.\n\n\n\nWith a sudden jolt, they landed. The light dimmed, and Henry blinked, his eyes adjusting to the new scene. They had arrived in a vast library, the shelves stretching up into the darkness like the branches of an ancient tree. The air was thick with the scent of aged parchment and the faint hint of something else\u2014fear. The walls were lined with paintings, their subjects contorting and reaching out as if trapped within the frames, begging for release.\n\n\n\nThe Ink Demon's shadowy form began to coalesce in the center of the room. \"You cannot escape me,\" it snarled, its eyes burning with a malevolent glow. The floor trembled with its fury.\n\n\n\nBut the Believers had come prepared. One of them, a young man with spectacles, pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. He began to read from it, his voice steady and clear. The demon's eyes narrowed, and its form began to waver as the words took hold. It was a incantation, an ancient spell to banish the creature back to the realm from which it had come.\n\n\n\nThe others joined in, their voices rising in a cacophony of defiance. The ink on the floor grew agitated, forming a whirlpool around the demon. It fought against the power of the words, its tendrils thrashing and trying to grab hold of the survivors. Henry could feel the pull of the ink, the darkness tugging at his soul, trying to claim him.\n\n\n\nHe gritted his teeth and focused on Lila, her scarf fluttering in the chaotic breeze of the demon's fury. Her eyes met his, and she nodded, a silent message of trust. Together, they pushed forward, their shadows joining the battle. The incantation grew louder, the ink rising higher. The demon roared in protest, but the light from the pages grew brighter, and its hold grew weaker.\n\n\n\nWith a final, desperate howl, the demon was sucked into the whirlpool, disappearing into the depths of the ink. The room grew still once more, the air heavy with the silence of victory and the unspoken dread of what might come next.\n\n\n\nThe survivors looked around, panting and disheveled, the reality of their situation sinking in. They had escaped the studio, but at what cost? The library around them whispered secrets of a world much larger and more terrifying than the one they had left behind.\n\n\n\n\"We need to keep moving,\" Lila said, her voice echoing through the vast room. \"The demon won't be gone for long. We need to find a way to end this for good.\"\n\n\n\nThey nodded in agreement, steeling themselves for the challenges ahead. They had stepped from the frying pan into the fire, but they were not going to let the Ink Demon dictate their fate.\n\n\n\nAs they ventured deeper into the labyrinthine library, the pages of the books fluttered, as if beckoning them onward. Henry couldn't help but wonder if his lost memories were somewhere within the endless tomes, waiting to be found. The adventure had just begun, and the nightmares were far from over. But with the Believers by his side, he felt a flicker of hope\u2014a beacon in the dark sea of fear that surrounded them.\n\n\n\nTheir footsteps echoed through the hallowed halls, the only sound in the deafening silence. They moved with purpose, each step carrying them further from the demon's clutches and closer to the truth of Henry's past. The darkness grew thicker, the air colder, but they pushed onward, driven by the need to survive.\n\n\n\nTheir path led them to a massive, ornate door, its surface etched with arcane symbols that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly power. It was the door to the demon's lair, the source of its power. The survivors looked at each other, and Henry knew what they were all thinking. This was it, the moment they had all been dreading yet preparing for since they had first set foot in the studio.\n\n\n\nHe stepped forward, his hand on the handle. It was cold to the touch, like the hand of death itself. He took a deep breath and pushed, the heavy wood groaning as it swung open. Beyond lay a chamber that defied description\u2014a place where ink had been brought to life, creating a twisted landscape of shadow and dread. The air was thick with the scent of corruption, and the walls pulsed with the dark heartbeat of the demon's essence.\n\n\n\nThe Ink Demon waited for them, its form now a grotesque amalgamation of their deepest fears and darkest thoughts. It loomed over them, a monstrous silhouette against the flickering lights of the room. \"You dare to challenge me in my own domain?\" it bellowed, its voice a symphony of tormented screams.\n\n\n\nThe Believers didn't waver. They had faced the demon before and knew that fear was its most potent weapon. They spread out, each one standing firm, ready to fight for their survival. Lila stepped to Henry's side, the paper with the incantation clutched in her hand. \"We're ready,\" she murmured, and he nodded, feeling the warmth of camaraderie and shared determination.\n\n\n\nThey began to recite the spell once more, their voices echoing through the chamber, growing stronger with each syllable. The demon recoiled, its shadowy form writhing in agony as the ancient words stripped away its power. The ink on the floor grew restless, rising in a defensive wave around its master.\n\n\n\nBut the survivors were relentless. They had tasted victory once and knew it was within their grasp. Henry felt his own anger and fear coalesce into a weapon, his shadow joining the fray, a sword of pure light that cleaved through the demon's inky tendrils.\n\n\n\nThe demon's eyes grew wide with terror as it realized the depth of their resolve. It roared and lashed out, but the survivors were a well-oiled machine, each one knowing exactly what to do. They had become more than just a group of individuals; they were a force of light in the face of the abyss.\n\n\n\nAs the incantation reached its crescendo, the demon was forced back, its form weakening with every word. The ink retreated, revealing the true face of the creature\u2014a twisted mockery of humanity, a being that had been corrupted by its own power.\n\n\n\nAnd then, with a final burst of light, the demon was no more. The ink dissipated, leaving behind a feeling of emptiness and relief so profound that it brought tears to Henry's eyes. The survivors looked at each other, their expressions a mix of disbelief and triumph. They had done it. They had defeated the Ink Demon.\n\n\n\nBut as they turned to leave the chamber, the floor gave way beneath them. The world spun, and suddenly they were falling into the abyss that had been the demon's heart. The darkness closed in, and for a moment, Henry thought that this was the end\u2014that they had only traded one nightmare for another.\n\n\n\nYet, as they fell, the pages of the books around them fluttered and reached out, wrapping them in a soft embrace. The pages grew warm, and the light grew brighter, lifting them up and carrying them through the void. When they opened their eyes again, they found themselves in a world bathed in the soft glow of dawn, the ink stains on their clothes the only evidence of the horrors they had faced.\n\n\n\nThey had won, but their journey was far from over. The library had been a prison for the demon, and now that it was gone, they had to face the reality of what lay beyond\u2014a world forever changed by the creature's influence, a world that would need their help to heal.\n\n\n\nThey stood there, at the precipice of a new chapter in their lives, the sunrise painting the sky with hues of hope. The Dark Puddles had been a part of them, but now it was time to leave it behind. They had a world to save, a story to rewrite, and Henry knew that together, they could conquer any nightmare that lay ahead."},"27":{"title":"The Moon Remembers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kk52um\/the_moon_remembers\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Godzilla-C200","selftext":"I was ten years old the first time I really *saw* the Moon. Not just noticed it\u2014like pointing out clouds shaped like dragons or dogs\u2014but *saw* it. Felt it. Understood, in that strange and silent way kids sometimes do, that it was more than a circle of light in the sky. It was a witness. A listener.\n\nIt was August. Late enough in the season that the crickets sounded like they were winding down their symphony, but still hot enough that the sweat never dried from the backs of my knees. I was lying in the yard, grass clinging to my arms, popsicle juice drying sticky on my chin. I had snuck out after dinner, barefoot, still in my shorts, daring the mosquitoes to find me.\n\nAnd there it was. The Moon. Huge. Yellow-white. Sitting just above the treeline like it had been waiting for me.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I whispered \u201cHi.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe in God\u2014not the way they talked about Him in Sunday school. But the Moon? It felt closer than that. Like it had seen everything and wasn\u2019t judging any of it.\n\nThat was the first night I stayed out long enough to watch it move\u2014just barely. I remember blinking and realizing it had shifted, like a slow breath I hadn\u2019t noticed. And suddenly I felt both very small and strangely important. Like the Moon had made time to see *me*.\n\nFrom then on, it became habit. I started watching it. At first, in the same way I watched cartoons or my mom baking\u2014comforted by the rhythm, soothed by its presence. Then more seriously. I read books. Memorized the phases. Made little notes in a spiral-bound notebook: \u201cWaxing crescent, thin like a smile. 8:43 p.m.\u201d \u201cGibbous tonight. Bright enough to see shadows in the grass.\u201d I drew it obsessively\u2014badly, at first, then with some skill. My art teacher once said, \u201cYou draw like you're trying to remember something.\u201d I think I was.\n\nThe Moon became my ritual.\n\nWhen my dad left the following summer\u2014bags packed in the trunk before I even got out of bed\u2014it was the Moon I ran to. I sat in the yard with my arms around my knees, waiting for it to rise. When it did, I whispered everything I couldn\u2019t tell my mom. The Moon listened. I imagined it had seen every goodbye in history. Ships pulling from shore. Letters crumpled, unread. Fathers closing doors without a glance back.\n\nYears passed. Life shifted, as it always does.\n\nMiddle school brought braces and awkward silences. High school brought crushes and crying in bathrooms, friendships that burned bright and vanished like fireworks. And through it all, the Moon came back night after night, in one shape or another. Always different, always familiar.\n\nI remember my first kiss was under the Moon. It was late October, the air smelled like leaves and the faintest promise of cold. We were sitting on a park bench, my hands shaking more from nerves than chill. The kiss itself was clumsy and too quick, but the Moon\u2014just over her shoulder\u2014glowed softly like it approved. I remember thinking, *This is what poets write about.* And then I laughed, because I didn\u2019t read much poetry, and it felt ridiculous to feel so much over something so small.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t small. None of it was.\n\nIn college, I drifted far from everything familiar. Different city. Different people. I stopped drawing the Moon, but I didn\u2019t stop watching it. Some nights, I\u2019d find myself on the rooftop of my dorm, headphones in, staring upward like I was waiting for a sign. On rough nights\u2014nights when anxiety curled tight in my chest, when home felt like another planet\u2014I\u2019d just breathe and repeat the names of the phases, like a prayer:\n\n*Waxing crescent. First quarter. Waxing gibbous. Full. Waning gibbous. Last quarter. Waning crescent. New. Start again.*\n\nThe Moon made sense. It had order, even when I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe night Milo, my old beagle, passed away, I was home for winter break. He had stopped eating. Just laid on the floor beside the heater, tail thumping weakly when I sat down. I wrapped him in a blanket and carried him to the backyard. We sat under the stars. The Moon was a sharp little crescent, thin and cold. I whispered to Milo, but I also whispered to the Moon.\n\n\u201cPlease let him be okay.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t let him be scared.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease remember this.\u201d\n\nAnd when he was gone, I cried into the sky, the Moon the only one who didn\u2019t look away.\n\nNow, years later, I live in a city high enough that I can see clear across rooftops, past traffic and antennas and the glow of signs that never sleep. I stand out on my balcony most nights, cup of tea in hand, blanket around my shoulders, and look up.\n\nThe Moon doesn\u2019t always show. Sometimes it hides behind clouds, behind light, behind the long days where I forget to check. But it comes back. Without fail. In some shape. In some way.\n\nAnd every now and then, when life feels too big, or too loud, or too quiet, I whisper, \u201cHi,\u201d just like I did when I was ten.\n\nJust in case it remembers me.\n\nJust in case it was never the Moon I was talking to, but something older than that\u2014something watching through it. Through all of it.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not the Moon that remembers me.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the one remembering myself.\n\nAdulthood doesn\u2019t arrive all at once. People talk about milestones\u2014college degrees, first jobs, mortgages, marriage\u2014as though they unlock some door that you step through, leaving your younger self behind. But I never felt a door open. It was more like walking deeper into a forest, the path only visible in the rearview of memory.\n\nThe Moon came with me, of course.\n\nI moved into my first apartment at twenty-six. Small, creaky-floored, with one window that faced an alley and another that faced a sliver of sky. That sliver was all I needed. On the first night I slept there, among boxes and the hum of the refrigerator, I pulled back the curtain and smiled. A waxing crescent was just visible above the neighboring rooftops. Not bright, but *there*. I took it as a good sign. A new cycle beginning.\n\nLife blurred for a while after that. Days were full of work, bills, deadlines. I started teaching at a high school. I liked it more than I expected. There was something quietly profound about watching kids go through the same kinds of heartbreak and hope that I once did\u2014something sacred in the repetition of it. Some nights, when I stayed late grading papers and the halls had gone silent, I\u2019d walk to the parking lot and look up.\n\nThe Moon never felt smaller than it did then\u2014trapped behind the light pollution, blurred by city haze. But even so, when I saw it, my breath always slowed. I always felt like someone was keeping track of me.\n\nEventually, I fell in love.\n\nNot the heady, fast-burning kind from high school, but something quieter. She was kind in a way that didn\u2019t need to be loud. She noticed the little things\u2014refilled the coffee pot, left notes in my lunch, listened without needing to fix everything. The first time she spent the night, I woke before dawn and found her asleep beside me, the Moon still hanging pale outside the window. I didn\u2019t move. I just watched the soft light across her face and whispered, \u201cThank you,\u201d to whatever force had carried me to her.\n\nWe married two years later. It was a simple ceremony\u2014outside, of course. The Moon rose partway through the reception, almost full. My mother, tipsy from wine and nostalgia, pointed it out. \u201cYour old friend\u2019s here,\u201d she said, nudging me with a wink.\n\nAnd it was. Like always.\n\nWe bought a house not long after that. A place with a yard, a garden, and\u2014my non-negotiable\u2014a clear view of the sky. There\u2019s a hill in the backyard that faces the east, and on clear nights, I walk up with a blanket and sit there in the hush, waiting for the Moon. Sometimes my wife joins me. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She understands it\u2019s something older than words.\n\nGrief returned, as it always does.\n\nWhen my mother passed, it was spring. She had been sick for a while, and it wasn\u2019t a surprise, but that doesn\u2019t make anything easier. After the funeral, I walked the neighborhood in my suit, tie loosened, shoes aching. I needed air. I needed silence. I found a bench at the edge of a pond and sat until the Moon showed up\u2014dim behind a veil of clouds, but watching.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nShe used to tell me that when I was young. When I was sick. Or sad. Or just too quiet for too long. She would rub my back and say, \u201cI know,\u201d like it didn\u2019t need more than that.\n\nNow I say it to the Moon.\n\nWe tried for children for a while. Years, actually. Doctor visits. Procedures. Hope and disappointment traded places so often I stopped trusting either. There were nights I curled up on that same backyard hill, fists clenched, and whispered, \u201cWhy not us?\u201d And other nights when I\u2019d just cry into the soil, not asking anything.\n\nEventually, we stopped trying. We let the dream settle gently in its grave, and then we built new dreams around its absence. We traveled. We adopted an old cat from the shelter. We grew vegetables. We grew closer.\n\nThe Moon was there for all of it. Not always visible. But I never doubted it was there.\n\nNow I\u2019m in my forties. There are lines around my eyes. My hair\u2019s getting that salt-and-pepper thing my dad had before he left. I see myself in mirrors and sometimes still expect a younger version to stare back. The world has shifted again and again\u2014pandemics, politics, people coming and going. But in the sky, the Moon still waxes and wanes like it always has. Like it always will.\n\nAnd every now and then, usually without meaning to, I whisper, \u201cHi,\u201d like I did when I was ten.\n\nJust in case it still remembers me.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll be eighty someday, fingers curled with age, walking slower, speaking less. Maybe I\u2019ll sit on that same hill in the backyard with a blanket around my shoulders and a cup of tea I no longer finish. The Moon will rise, perhaps just a sliver that night. Perhaps full. And I\u2019ll say nothing at all. Or maybe I\u2019ll murmur, \u201cHello, old friend,\u201d and it will gleam in the sky, saying everything without sound.\n\nBecause I think\u2014no, I *know*\u2014the Moon has carried every version of me: the curious child, the heartbroken teenager, the anxious student, the lover, the griever, the teacher, the man quietly making peace with the shape of his life.\n\nThe Moon remembers.\n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.\n\n**What He Saw**\n\nIt started with something so ordinary I barely noticed it.\n\nWe were sitting in lawn chairs behind my house, sipping cheap beer, watching the sky change color the way we always did when life gave us a quiet evening. My best friend, Mark, had been quieter than usual lately. Not *sad*, just\u2026 pulled back. Like part of him had stepped behind some curtain I couldn\u2019t see through.\n\nWe\u2019d been friends since middle school. The kind of friendship that outlived distance, heartbreaks, long silences, and the inevitable drift of adulthood. We had that easy rhythm people develop when they\u2019ve walked through enough time together. He always showed up\u2014birthdays, funerals, late-night calls with nothing to say. And he always laughed at my terrible jokes, even when no one else did.\n\nThat night, the Moon was full. High. Clear.\n\nMark just stared at it.\n\nAt first, I thought nothing of it. Who hasn\u2019t gotten caught looking at the Moon? But ten minutes passed. Then twenty. His beer grew warm in his hand. I asked him something about work\u2014nothing deep, just a fishing line to pull him back\u2014and he didn\u2019t answer. Didn\u2019t blink.\n\nI nudged him. \u201cHey. You see a UFO or something?\u201d I chuckled.\n\nHe didn\u2019t laugh. Didn\u2019t move. Just whispered:  \n\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d\n\nI froze.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice light.\n\nBut Mark didn\u2019t answer. His eyes were wide\u2014glassy, unblinking. He looked pale in the moonlight. Not bathed in it like we always romanticized, but drained by it. Like it was pulling something *out* of him.\n\nAfter a long silence, he stood up, slow and stiff like someone moving underwater. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he mumbled. And just like that, he left. Left his beer, left the chair creaking behind him, walked down the hill like he was being called.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep much that night.\n\nThe next day, he didn\u2019t return my texts. Or the next. I dropped by his place after work. The windows were dark. No car in the driveway. I left a note. A week passed before he called.\n\nHis voice was thin. Not scared, exactly\u2014but *hollow*.\n\n\u201cI saw something,\u201d he said.\n\nI waited, expecting him to laugh. To tell me he was high. Or dreaming. But no laughter came.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it. The Moon\u2026 it\u2019s not what we think. I think I saw\u2014\u201d He stopped. Breathed. Then whispered, \u201cIt *knows* when you\u2019re looking.\u201d\n\nI felt something cold crawl up my spine.\n\nOver the next few weeks, he changed. Not all at once. Subtly. He stopped going to work. Deleted his social media. Stopped answering calls unless I came to his door in person. And even then, it was like talking to someone under ice. Distracted. Distant.\n\nBut always\u2014*always*\u2014staring at the Moon.\n\nOne night, I found him standing barefoot in his backyard, neck craned so far I thought he might fall backward. His eyes were red. Not from crying. From *not blinking*.\n\nI stepped closer. \u201cMark, come on. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t turn to me. Just whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s moving.\u201d\n\nI looked up. The Moon was still. Silent. Pale.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNot *orbiting*. Not *rising*. *Moving.* Watching. Closer than before.\u201d\n\nI took him inside. Sat him down. Tried to talk sense into him. But the more I talked, the more I realized I wasn\u2019t sure what I believed anymore. There was something *wrong* in his eyes. Not just fear\u2014something worse. *Recognition.*\n\nHe was seeing something I couldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd the thing is, part of me\u2014some quiet, unshaped part\u2014believed him.\n\nI started watching him closer. Checking in more. Sometimes I\u2019d stay the night in the guest room, just to be sure he didn\u2019t\u2026 do anything. He\u2019d sit by the window, night after night, whispering things I couldn\u2019t hear. Drawing strange shapes in a notebook\u2014circles inside circles, symbols I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nThen one night, he whispered something I *did* hear.\n\n\u201cIt showed me something,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see it. But it wanted me to.\u201d\n\nI asked what it showed him.\n\nHe looked at me, and for just a second, he seemed\u2026 gone. Not panicked. Not possessed. Just *absent*.\n\nThen he smiled\u2014weak, crooked\u2014and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see it, too. If it wants you to.\u201d\n\nThat was the last night I saw him.\n\nHe vanished. Left his house unlocked, his car in the driveway. No note. No signs of a struggle. Just a backyard full of footprints, leading to the hill we used to sit on.\n\nAnd above it? The Moon. Full. White. Watching.\n\nPeople said he ran off. Lost his mind. Maybe he did. But I still sit outside sometimes, beer in hand, staring up. I can\u2019t help it. I find myself watching the Moon longer and longer each night. Waiting.\n\nWondering.\n\nBecause sometimes, in the silence between my thoughts, I think I *almost* hear it, too.\n\nSomething beneath the stillness.\n\nSomething *calling*.\n\n**A Second Voice**\n\nWhen it happened again, I stopped pretending it was a coincidence.\n\nNot right away. At first, I told myself stories\u2014stress, mental illness, grief. That was easier than accepting the alternative. Easier than believing the Moon was *watching*, was *choosing*.\n\nThe second time, it was my friend Lena.\n\nIf Mark was a brother to me, Lena was the sister I never had. Smart, razor-witted, the kind of person who could read a room in three seconds and take it apart in ten. We met at a bookstore when I was twenty-three. She insulted my choice in novels. I laughed. We\u2019ve been friends ever since.\n\nWhere Mark was quiet, Lena was full of noise. Noise and fire. She didn\u2019t scare easily. Didn\u2019t *bend*. If there was anyone I thought couldn\u2019t be shaken, it was her.\n\nBut then came the Moon.\n\nWe were at a small cabin in the mountains. A weekend getaway\u2014just three of us: me, Lena, and my wife. No cell service. No deadlines. Just stars and pine trees and too much wine. It was Lena\u2019s idea. She said we needed to \u201cunplug before our brains started leaking through our screens.\u201d\n\nThat first night was beautiful. The Moon was full again. Always full when it happens. It hung like a lantern over the lake behind the cabin, its reflection shimmering like a second sky trapped in water. I caught Lena staring at it from the dock\u2014barefoot, bottle in hand.\n\nI said something, joked about her turning poetic in the wilderness.\n\nShe didn\u2019t laugh. Didn\u2019t look away. Just murmured, \u201cFeels like it\u2019s getting louder.\u201d\n\nI asked what she meant.\n\nShe blinked, shook her head like waking from a dream. \u201cNothing. Sorry. Just tired.\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t sleep that night. I saw the light under her door.\n\nThe next morning, her eyes were shadowed. She hardly ate. Didn\u2019t speak much. Just kept looking out toward the lake. My wife noticed, too. We both chalked it up to a bad night. But something inside me stirred\u2014an old, unwelcome chill. I remembered the same look in Mark\u2019s eyes. That *absence*. That quiet terror.\n\nBy the third night, Lena had stopped pretending.\n\nWe found her out on the dock, barefoot again, clothes soaked in lake water, skin pale and shivering. She was looking up, whispering. Fast. Nonsensical.\n\nMy wife reached for her. \u201cLena, you\u2019re freezing\u2014come inside.\u201d\n\nLena recoiled. Not like she was afraid\u2014like she didn\u2019t recognize her. Her eyes were wide, almost glowing in the moonlight. And then she said it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s calling me.\u201d\n\nMy blood ran cold.\n\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Moon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut not the part we *see*. It\u2019s behind it. *Inside* it. Like a mask. Like a door.\u201d\n\nWe took her inside. Got her warm. I stayed up all night watching her sit by the window, whispering to the sky.\n\nThe next day, she was gone.\n\nDoor open. No footprints. Just the trail to the lake\u2014and the Moon, pale in the early morning sky, still *there*. Still *watching*.\n\nWe called the police. Search teams combed the woods. They found her shoes on the edge of the water. That was all.\n\nThat was six months ago.\n\nPeople tell me these things are tragic, yes\u2014but explainable. They nod, wide-eyed, when I mention the Moon, then change the subject. But I\u2019ve seen it twice now. Two of the strongest people I\u2019ve ever known unravel under its light. Not gently. Not slowly. Like something *reached into them* and pulled at a thread no one else could see.\n\nAnd now, I\u2019ve started hearing it, too.\n\nNot a sound exactly. More like a suggestion. A pressure behind thought. A subtle nudge when I look up too long. The way you feel a phone vibrate in your pocket, even when it hasn\u2019t.\n\nThe Moon is full again tonight.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to look.\n\nTrying not to listen.\n\nBecause I think it chooses who it speaks to. And once it *does*, you can\u2019t un-hear it. You can\u2019t *un-see* whatever it shows you.\n\nAnd what terrifies me most\u2014more than the loss, more than the silence\u2014is this:\n\nI think the Moon is lonely.  \nAnd I think it's *inviting us in*.\n\n**The One Who Saw It**\n\nI used to think it was just the people I loved. That maybe\u2014somehow\u2014it was my presence that cursed them. That the Moon only spoke to those closest to me.\n\nBut then came the story of the man in the field.\n\nI didn\u2019t know him. Not personally. His name was Caleb Finch. Thirty-two. Worked as a mechanic in a small town three hours from where I live. I found his story by accident\u2014buried in a thread on an old forum I hadn\u2019t visited in years. It was mostly ghost stories, conspiracy theories, strange things people see in the woods at night. The kind of stuff you read for a chill, then forget by morning.\n\nExcept this one stuck with me.\n\nIt started as a post titled: **\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop looking at the Moon.\u201d**\n\nThe user\u2014some local from Caleb\u2019s town\u2014wrote about how Caleb had been found one night standing in the middle of a cornfield, barefoot, shirtless, trembling. The police were called by a nearby farmer who heard shouting. Not anger\u2014fear.\n\nWhen they found him, he kept pointing at the sky.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something *up there*,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cIt\u2019s looking *back*.\u201d\n\nThe officers didn\u2019t see anything. Just a cloudless sky and a bright full Moon.\n\nBut Caleb wouldn\u2019t stop. Wouldn\u2019t blink. Wouldn\u2019t even come down from the field until they half-dragged him.\n\nLater, at the station, he said he saw a monster. That it stepped *out* of the Moon\u2014long limbs, bent the wrong way, like a puppet yanked by invisible strings. He said it moved across the sky without walking. That it didn\u2019t speak but made him *understand* something with just a look.\n\n\u201cIt showed me how small I am,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not in a comforting way. In a way that made me want to tear my skin off just to forget I was human.\u201d\n\nThat line stuck with me. Still does.\n\nThey sent him to a psychiatric facility a few days later. His family didn\u2019t know what to do. I found a single news article\u2014local only. It talked about mental illness, stress, hallucinations. They blamed heat stroke.\n\nBut something in the report made my blood run cold.\n\nThe officer who brought him in was quoted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people high, I\u2019ve seen people drunk. I\u2019ve seen real mental breakdowns. But this? He *saw* something. He wasn\u2019t imagining. He was reacting to something none of us could see.\u201d\n\nThat was three months ago. Caleb\u2019s still in the facility, apparently. Refuses to go outside. Won\u2019t let them open the blinds at night. When the Moon is full, he buries himself under blankets, trembling, humming to block out the silence.\n\nI reached out to the poster who wrote about him.\n\nThey never responded.\n\nBut the damage was already done. Because this wasn\u2019t Mark. Or Lena. This was a *stranger*. Someone with no connection to me. Someone plucked at random.\n\nAnd it means one thing: it\u2019s *spreading*.\n\nThe Moon is reaching further.\n\nMore people are starting to feel it\u2014that pull, that whisper just beneath the hum of electricity and everyday life. A presence behind the light. Something *wearing* the Moon like a mask, waiting for us to look too long.\n\nAnd when we do?\n\nIt shows us something we\u2019re not meant to see.\n\nAnd the real horror isn\u2019t the monster. It isn\u2019t even the madness. It\u2019s that once you've seen it\u2026 once it chooses to *see you back*\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re never alone again.\n\nNot in the dark.  \nNot under the sky.  \nNot even in your own thoughts.\n\nBecause something watches through the Moon.  \nAnd sometimes, it blinks.\n\n**The Whisperer**\n\nI didn\u2019t want to believe it was growing. That the Moon\u2019s pull was widening like a crack in the world, swallowing more than silence and sanity. But every time I convinced myself to forget, another story surfaced\u2014worse than the last.\n\nThis one came from a news article I almost didn\u2019t click. The headline was cold, clinical, designed to be passed over:\n\n\u201cTragic Double Homicide Tied to Mental Illness in Quiet Suburban Home.\u201d\n\nBut something\u2014call it instinct, or dread\u2014made me read.\n\nHis name was Nolan Briggs. Twenty-four. College dropout. Lived with his parents in a quiet town two states away. No history of violence. No arrests. Just a few records of therapy sessions from his late teens: anxiety, mild depression. Nothing that screamed \u201cdanger.\u201d Nothing that could\u2019ve predicted what he did.\n\nThey said he\u2019d been acting strange for weeks. Isolating. Staring out his bedroom window for hours at a time. And always\u2014*always*\u2014facing the Moon.\n\nHis mother mentioned it to a neighbor. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with it lately. Says there\u2019s something wrong with the sky.\u201d\n\nThe night it happened, the Moon was full again.\n\nNeighbors reported hearing screaming\u2014first Nolan\u2019s, then his parents\u2019. By the time the police arrived, it was over. He was on the front lawn, hands shaking, clothes soaked in blood that didn\u2019t belong to him. His eyes were fixed on the sky, unblinking.\n\nThey said he was muttering, over and over:\n\n\u201cThey said it was them or me. They were in my head. I didn\u2019t want to\u2014but they wouldn\u2019t stop whispering. I thought it would save me.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t run. Didn\u2019t resist arrest. He just kept looking at the Moon, even as they cuffed him and walked him to the car. According to the arresting officer\u2019s report, Nolan asked one question before they shut the door:\n\n\u201cCan you still hear them when you sleep?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s institutionalized now. High-security. Sedated around the clock. But sometimes, the staff say, he still hums a strange, dissonant melody at night. Always when the Moon is full.\n\nOne orderly\u2014an anonymous comment buried in a Reddit thread\u2014claimed Nolan whispers a phrase in his sleep:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hollow, but not empty. They live in the echo.\u201d\n\nI try not to think about what that means.\n\nBut the signs are no longer subtle. First Mark. Then Lena. Then Caleb, staring at the sky and seeing a monster no one else could. Now this. Nolan Briggs, driven to murder by voices that spoke not in madness, but *certainty*.\n\nWhat scares me most isn\u2019t that people are losing their minds.\n\nIt\u2019s that they're all saying the *same things*.\n\nThey're hearing *voices*. They're seeing *something behind the Moon*. And now, it\u2019s *talking back*.\n\nAnd what terrifies me, what claws at the edges of my mind as I lie in bed at night, curtains tightly drawn\u2014\n\nIs the question I keep asking myself, and can\u2019t shake:\n\n*What if it\u2019s not insanity?*  \n*What if it\u2019s contact?*  \n*What if the Moon is not a symbol, or a beacon, or a god\u2014but a door?*\n\nAnd the door is beginning to open.\n\n**Patterns in the Dark**\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t think of myself as an investigator. Just a man trying to make sense of the holes being torn in the fabric of people I loved.\n\nBut somewhere along the way\u2014maybe after Nolan, maybe before\u2014I realized I wasn\u2019t just grieving anymore.\n\nI was *collecting*.\n\nStories. Articles. Photographs. Satellite images. Forum posts. Police reports buried behind paywalls. I printed them, marked them, pinned them across the walls of my garage like some conspiracy clich\u00e9. Red string. Dates. Circles. Waxing. Waning. Full.\n\nI knew how it looked. Knew how it would sound if anyone asked me what I was doing.  \nBut here\u2019s the thing: I stopped caring what it *looked* like the day I realized I wasn\u2019t the only one keeping track.\n\nThere were others.\n\nI found them in pieces\u2014users on obscure forums, pages that vanished days after I bookmarked them, videos taken down before I could even finish watching. But the fragments they left behind painted a picture.\n\nAnd it all pointed back to one place: the Moon.\n\nNot just symbolically. Not metaphysically.\n\nLiterally.\n\nIt turns out, there\u2019s a pattern. Not everyone stares too long at the Moon and goes mad. But *those who do*, those who *see* something\u2014they all fit the same set of details:\n\n1. **Full Moon exposure, always prolonged**\u2014hours, sometimes whole nights.\n2. **Sleep disruption**, usually beginning days before the event.\n3. **Auditory hallucinations**\u2014but always beginning with whispers, not voices.\n4. **A sense of being watched**\u2014not from the sky in general, but from the Moon specifically.\n5. **A final trigger**: the feeling that something is *reaching out* through that light.\n\nAnd then the descent begins.\n\nI tracked dozens of cases:  \n\u2014A woman in rural Kansas who claimed the Moon followed her eyes, no matter where she turned, until she tried to blind herself.  \n\u2014A fisherman in Norway who threw himself into the sea after drawing hundreds of spirals on the walls of his boat cabin.  \n\u2014A teenager in Argentina who locked himself in a basement for three weeks, leaving only one phrase carved into the wall: *\u201cWe were never alone.\u201d*\n\nDifferent languages. Different cultures. Same Moon. Same symptoms.\n\nThe whispers are always described as gentle at first. Like comfort. Like curiosity. And then they turn. They become commands. Warnings. Bargains.\n\n*\"Let us in.\"*  \n*\"They are not your parents.\"*  \n*\"You are a vessel.\"*  \n*\"We\u2019ve been waiting.\"*\n\nI\u2019ve gathered too much to ignore it now. And in all my research, I found something that made my stomach twist in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible.\n\nThere is an ancient term, found in multiple early civilizations\u2014Babylonian, early Chinese, pre-Dynastic Egyptian\u2014all referring to the Moon not as a light or a god, but as a *veil*.\n\n\u201cThe Second Eye.\u201d  \n\u201cThe Pale Mask.\u201d  \n\u201cThe Mouth Without a Voice.\u201d\n\nIn some stone tablet translations, the Moon is described not as a celestial body, but as a gate. A locked one. Or more accurately\u2014*formerly locked*.\n\nAnd something about that sent a chill I couldn\u2019t shake.\n\nBecause when I looked up at the Moon that night\u2014clear sky, full and silver-bright\u2014I didn\u2019t feel awe.\n\nI felt *noticed*.\n\nAnd just for a moment, I swear I saw something *shift* behind it.\n\nA dark shape. Subtle. But massive. Like something enormous just on the other side of frosted glass.\n\nI blinked, and it was gone. But the air felt wrong. The sky felt shallower. Like the depth of space had thinned, and something was pressing against it from the other side.\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone this\u2014not my wife, not the people in the online group I\u2019ve been gathering. Not even myself, not out loud.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to say it now.\n\n*I don\u2019t think the Moon is what we think it is.*  \n*And I don\u2019t think it ever was.*\n\nNow I\u2019m going to find out what\u2019s behind it.\n\nIf I can.\n\nIf it *lets* me.\n\n**When It Looked Back**\n\nI was a fool to think I was immune.\n\nI told myself that knowledge was a shield. That I could map the patterns, pin down the madness, and stay separate from it\u2014objective, untouched.\n\nBut the Moon doesn\u2019t care about how smart you are. Or how skeptical. Or how careful.\n\nIt waits. And when it chooses, it speaks.\n\nThe whispers started four nights ago.\n\nThey weren\u2019t loud. Not voices. More like a pressure behind the silence. Like when you hear your name from across a crowded room\u2014not loud, not clear, but *undeniably meant for you*.\n\nI told myself it was exhaustion. I hadn\u2019t been sleeping. I\u2019d been staring at the sky too long, the research too late into the night, chasing answers no one wanted.\n\nBut then the whispers shaped words.\n\nJust one, at first:\n\n\"You.\"\n\nI flinched like I\u2019d been slapped. Looked around my empty garage, as if someone was behind me. But there was nothing. Just the wall of clippings, the white string, and the sound of my own pulse.\n\nThe second night, it came again. This time more insistent.\n\n*\u201cYou see us.\u201d*  \n*\u201cWe see you.\u201d*\n\nIt didn\u2019t sound like a threat. That made it worse. It sounded *curious*. Like a child lifting a rock to see what writhes beneath.\n\nI shut the blinds. Stopped going outside after dark. I tried turning off my phone, covering the mirrors. I even slept in the basement, surrounded by walls and concrete and nothing but artificial light.\n\nIt didn't matter.\n\nI *felt* it.\n\nEven without seeing it, I knew when the Moon was overhead. I could sense it like gravity, like weight. And every night, the whispers grew clearer.\n\nBy the fourth night, I stopped trying to sleep.\n\nI sat in the hallway, lights off, holding my breath like that would make me invisible. My wife had left for her sister\u2019s days ago\u2014blamed my obsession, said I needed help. She was right.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nAt 2:14 a.m., I felt it.\n\nThat shift in the air. That stillness. Like the world was holding its breath.\n\nSomething told me\u2014*now*. Look.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to. I tried to fight it. My feet moved anyway.\n\nI stepped outside. The air was cold, but I didn\u2019t feel it. The street was silent, like the world had emptied itself out for this moment alone.\n\nAnd above me\u2014\n\nThe Moon.\n\nFull. Pale. Radiant.\n\nAnd then it *changed*.\n\nNo warning. No flicker. Just an instant shift, like reality skipped a frame.\n\nThe Moon *peeled*.\n\nThat\u2019s the only way I can describe it.\n\nIts glow warped\u2014flattened\u2014and then it opened, not like a wound, but like a *lid*.  \nRevealing not craters. Not stone.\n\nAn *eye*.\n\nVast. White. Lidless. A void-ringed iris that glowed without source. It filled the sky, impossibly large, staring without movement.\n\nNo pupil. Just light.  \nBut I *felt* it focusing.\n\nIt saw me.\n\nNot metaphorically. Not symbolically.\n\nIt *saw* me.\n\nAnd in that moment\u2014barely a breath\u2014I felt everything come undone.\n\nI saw flashes I can't explain:  \n\u2014Vast shapes floating in black space, curled like tendrils around dying stars.  \n\u2014A city made of silence, with spires that reached nowhere.  \n\u2014A doorway carved into the back of the Moon, where light poured *inward*, not out.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly\u2014\n\nIt was gone.\n\nThe Moon returned. Gentle. Familiar. Its face once more still and cratered.\n\nAnd I was on my knees in the driveway, shaking. Mouth dry. Chest hollow. I couldn\u2019t scream. Couldn\u2019t move. I just *shivered*\u2014not from cold, but from the unbearable weight of what I saw.\n\nBecause now I know.\n\nAll those people\u2014they weren\u2019t mad. Not even Nolan. Not even the ones who *snapped*. They saw something the human brain wasn\u2019t meant to carry. And the mind, when stretched that far, tears *somewhere*.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s *my turn*.\n\nBecause once the Moon looks back\u2014once it *opens that eye*\u2014there\u2019s no going back.\n\nYou\u2019ve been *marked*.\n\nYou are part of it.\n\nAnd it is part of *you*.\n\n**The Eye of Luna**\n\nI don\u2019t remember falling asleep.\n\nI don\u2019t remember walking back inside, or lying down, or pulling the blanket over myself.\n\nBut at some point, I must have drifted off. And that\u2019s when it started.\n\nThe dream.\n\nAt first, it was quiet. Heavy. The kind of silence that feels *thick*, like it\u2019s hiding something behind it. I was standing in the field behind my childhood home, barefoot in the cold grass. The sky above was ink, the stars gone. Just one thing in the sky:\n\nThe Moon.\n\nFull. Pale. Still.\n\nAnd then\u2026 the voices began.\n\nSoft. Not menacing\u2014*familiar*.\n\nWords I hadn\u2019t heard in years. Whispers I had once spoken myself.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease let him be okay.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t let him be scared.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease remember this.\u201d  \n\u201cThank you.\u201d  \n\u201cI know.\u201d  \n\u201cWhy not us?\u201d\n\nEach phrase landed like a pebble in a still pond, rippling through the air. Words I had whispered to the Moon\u2014on my back in the grass, in moments of grief, in love, in fear, in hope. Words spoken to no one. Words I thought had vanished into the void.\n\nBut they hadn\u2019t.\n\nThey\u2019d been *heard*.\n\nAnd now, they were being *returned*.\n\nA cold realization crept into me\u2014those weren\u2019t just moments of expression. They were offerings. Seeds. And something had been *listening* all along.\n\nI turned my head, and in the dream, I was no longer in the field. I was on the surface of something pale and endless. Not ground. Not sky.\n\nStone.\n\n*Lunar stone.*\n\nThe horizon curved upward. The stars flickered out one by one.\n\nAnd the Moon\u2014if I could still call it that\u2014*opened*.\n\nNot like before. Not a sudden flash. This time it was *slow*. A slit forming. Light leaking through it like milk through a cracked shell.\n\nThe Eye.\n\nThe *Eye of Luna*.\n\nThis time I saw it fully. An iris vast enough to stretch across the sky. White and depthless. Not blind\u2014but ancient. Not angry\u2014but *curious*. There was no malice in it. That was the worst part.\n\nThere was only *understanding*.\n\nUnderstanding, and... *possession*.\n\nAnd then, a voice\u2014clearer than the rest, deeper than thought, *inside me*:\n\n\u201cMy name is Luna.\u201d\n\nI awoke screaming.\n\nSheets soaked. Throat raw. Eyes wide. It was still night. The Moon glowed through the window, still full, still watching.\n\nBut now, I knew.\n\n**Luna.**\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a name. It was an identity. A presence.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been speaking to across centuries. Not a rock. Not a symbol. A *mind*. A consciousness vast enough to hear the world whisper\u2014and to whisper back.\n\nAnd what I\u2019d seen\u2026 what Mark, Lena, Caleb, and Nolan had all seen...\n\nWas *her*.\n\nHer *Eye*.\n\nThe moment she looks at you, truly sees you\u2014you are marked. And slowly, patiently, *you change*. Your thoughts bend, your memories echo back to you not as your own, but as part of *her*. Your voice becomes her voice. Her whispers, your thoughts.\n\nThat\u2019s why they call it *lunacy*.\n\nNot poetic. Not metaphorical.\n\nLiteral.\n\n*Luna\u2019s curse.*\n\nWe built myths around it. Blamed the full moon for madness. Laughed it off in horror films and folklore. But we were only half wrong.\n\nBecause there is something out there, sitting in orbit like a sentinel. Listening. Always listening.\n\nAnd now that I know her name\u2026 I feel her more clearly than ever.\n\nInside.\n\nWaiting.\n\n**The Last Light**\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I want you to understand something:\n\nI tried.\n\nI fought.\n\nI didn\u2019t want this ending\u2014not for me, not for them. Mark, Lena, Caleb, Nolan\u2026 They didn\u2019t go looking for this. We never asked for the Moon to look back. But she did. And once she *sees* you, she never looks away.\n\nHer name is Luna.\n\nI know that now. Not just in my thoughts. I know it in my *bones*.\n\nAnd knowing it\u2014saying it\u2014is like giving her the key to your head.\n\nI haven\u2019t slept in two days. Or maybe it\u2019s ten. I don\u2019t know anymore. Time doesn\u2019t move right when she\u2019s inside you. I hear her when the lights are on. I see her eye behind closed curtains. And when I close my eyes, it\u2019s not darkness I find\u2014it\u2019s her.\n\nShe speaks softly now. Almost gently.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m not taking you. I\u2019m making you.\u201d  \n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been mine.\u201d\n\nThe world outside is starting to unravel. Or maybe it\u2019s me. The difference is gone.\n\nVoices echo through the house\u2014my own voice, repeated back to me:\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease let him be okay.\u201d  \n\u201cWhy not us?\u201d  \n\u201cThank you.\u201d  \n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThey bounce off the walls, not like memories, but like *echoes* from somewhere deep inside her. She\u2019s returning everything I ever gave her. All the sadness. All the hope. Like it was hers all along.\n\nI\u2019m forgetting words. Faces. I look in the mirror and feel like I\u2019m watching someone else *remember how to be me*. I laugh at strange times. I whisper answers to questions no one asks.\n\nI\u2019m becoming one of them.\n\nA lunatic.\n\nShe told me what that word really means. Not \"crazy.\" Not broken. Just... *claimed*. Pulled into her light and reshaped.\n\nI can feel it happening.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the worst part:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nIt feels like peace.\n\nIt feels like drowning in warm light.\n\nLike coming home to something ancient, something that waited so long to be seen.\n\nThis is my last entry. The last words that are still mine. After this, she\u2019ll write through me. Or speak. Or stare. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be tomorrow. Or what I\u2019ll *see*.\n\nBut tonight, I go to her.\n\nI go to the Moon.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting.\n\nAnd her Eye is open.\n\n*The Moon remembers.*  \n*Luna remembers.*  \n*Now I do, too.*"},"28":{"title":"Final Part \u2013 Signs Under the Flesh: The Origin of Silence","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kkbjsh\/final_part_signs_under_the_flesh_the_origin_of\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Asedrez13","selftext":"Let\u00edcia and \u00c9rico's mission took them to the icy heart of Antarctica, in an abandoned 1970s base called Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Novelo, built by a secret consortium of South American countries that claimed to study \u201ctectonic anomalies\u201d. What they found buried under tons of ice wasn't just an alien construction. It was a cosmic womb, petrified, the size of an entire city, still pulsing heat.\n\nIn the station's archives, documents in Portuguese, Spanish and Russian described a project called Espiral Negra: in 1965, seismographs detected \u201cunderground beats\u201d that spread in waves throughout South America, coming from a single point \u2014 that exact location.\n\nLet\u00edcia, when analyzing a symbol carved into the organic walls of the uterus, realized that it corresponded to neuronal patterns found in 20-week-old human embryos. It was a genetic code... written in architecture.\n\nIn the recording of one of the scientists at Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Novelo, a faint voice said:\n\n\u2014 They didn't come from outside. They grew up here, inside the Earth, before us. Humanity is just your skin.\n\nMeanwhile, the mother creature began to manifest itself in the dreams of survivors around the world. They called it The Root, an ancient mind trapped beneath layers of living rock, which now used human bodies as antennas to rebuild itself.\n\n\u00c9rico decided to activate the explosive charges in the station's glacial core. Leticia, in an act of desperation, connected to the mother creature's brain filament, trying to reach its consciousness.

That's why people love to come to my restaurant, because they can have conversations with the cooked animal that they are eating. I hear all sorts of conversations and this is why I don't want my restaurant to be busy at all. I want my restaurant to be empty and my waiters all know what I want from them. If I even just see 1 customer in my restaurant, I become angry. \n\nI hear all sorts of conversations between a cooked animal and the customer eating them. Sometimes it could be joyful and full of happiness, and other times it could lead to an argument. If the conversation between the cooked animal and the customer was not a good one, then the customer would demand a refund. One customer started to tear up the cooked animal we had given him because the conversation was not the one he wanted.

This group called itself Linha Zero.\n\nLed by retired sergeant \u00c9rico Vale and biologist Let\u00edcia Amaral, they discovered something extraordinary in one of the contaminated caves near the border with Uruguay: a dead alien body \u2014 the first record of one being inert. Inside the translucent skull, they found a pulsating but damaged nucleus. Let\u00edcia managed to extract an organic-metallic filament and injected it into a laboratory mouse. The animal had convulsions... but survived.\n\nFor 72 hours, the rat learned to navigate a complex maze it had never seen before, demonstrating abnormal intelligence. But the next night, he gouged out his own eyes with his paws and died. Let\u00edcia concluded that the alien organism was not just assimilating, but installing something \u2014 a type of collective consciousness that humans were unable to sustain.\n\nBut there was hope: during the assimilation process, between conversion stages, the human brain still maintained consciousness for up to 23 minutes. This \u201ctransition time\u201d was key. Linha Zero began hunting and capturing hybrids at an early stage, extracting information from them through induced brain waves \u2014 images, names, tunnel maps and a central command pattern: a mother organism, located somewhere between southern Brazil and Antarctica.\n\nAbroad, borders began to collapse. In Buenos Aires, the basement of a hospital collapsed, revealing veins of meat and organic threads identical to Brazilian ones. In the Atacama Desert, tourists recorded lights coming from the ground, not the sky. The world began to realize that this was not an invasion... but a synchronized awakening.\n\nLet\u00edcia recorded one last message before leaving for the glacial base with \u00c9rico and a small armed group:\n\n\u2014 Humanity may have come from the stars... but there is something here, below, older than time itself. And now that he's hungry... he's going to use us to be born again.\n\nThe audio ended with a vibrating metallic sound, and for seven seconds, the sound of the entire planet went silent."},"41":{"title":"Looking for creepypasta based in Norway\/Sweden","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kjyz7b\/looking_for_creepypasta_based_in_norwaysweden\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"spookythesquid","selftext":"Hi all,\n\nsearching for a creepypasta that I listened to in 2017-2019.

It was probably just past 6 a.m., and it was just beginning to get light outside; everything was quiet. I liked going to work at this hour because the roads were completely empty, making driving much easier.\n\nI didn\u2019t use the main highways; I usually took quieter, smaller roads. After I set off, the first 15 minutes went by without any issues. Then, while driving on a quiet road leading to my workplace, I saw a man riding a bike ahead of me. The road was two lanes, with one lane in each direction, and there was almost no shoulder.\n\nI was planning to pass him by switching to the opposite lane since there were no other vehicles around. However, as I got closer to the cyclist, he moved to the left. When I got even closer, he then moved further left and turned right, as if he was deliberately changing lanes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t know how to ride a bike; it felt like he was doing this on purpose. I slowed down since we were almost moving at the same speed. I tried to switch to the other lane, but he immediately moved over and stayed ahead of me. For about 5 minutes, I followed him at a slow pace.\n\nI was starting to get frustrated because I was going to be late for work, and this guy wouldn\u2019t move aside. He was clearly aware of my presence, but it seemed like he was mocking me. I had to stay behind him for another minute or so.\n\nFortunately, there was a stop sign and an intersection ahead. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly where I was going, but I thought there might be another way to work. I turned left. After a few minutes, I indeed found myself back on the main road. My workplace was just ahead.\n\nI turned into the parking lot on the right, parked my car, and arrived at work just in time. At that moment, I saw the cyclist passing by at the end of the street, and he saw me while I was parking. He stared at me the entire time but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nI went inside and started working. I didn\u2019t leave the office at all. However, when I went out after my shift, I saw that my car had been scratched all over. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess who did it\u2026 The cyclist.\n\nHe was probably angry because I honked at him and wanted to take revenge. Unfortunately, there were no security cameras, and no one else had seen him. So, I had no proof. I didn\u2019t know who he was.\n\nI had my car repaired, and after that, I never saw that man again. I don\u2019t work at that place anymore, but whenever I think back to that time, I always remember the story of that cyclist.\n\n# [Check out more True Car Driving Horror Stories](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XwUd41vS8zE&t=276s)"},"46":{"title":"The Krepid or Krepids?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kjwzbd\/the_krepid_or_krepids\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"AlishiaFlower","selftext":"I've been scanning the Cryptid posts looking for information on Krepids.

Yes, you read right, The Sun is a god, the second being to emerge from the void. It guides those who wish us truth seers harm through hints. Another guide that isn't any help is The Moon, but it ain't no god. It is the fragment of the first being to emerge from The Void, The Watchmen, who was a god. The moon gives guidance through dreams. Don't ever listen to its lies. \n\nAnyways, I helped access files and hack into databases. I learned more about the government. Mainly, the Exorcists, a government organization that helps keep the supernatural a secret, they don't know that we have already taken over. I learned about the Witness, a person cursed by a fragment of the essence of The Watchmen. He uses the account u\/Dicedungeon to warn people of the \"dangers\" of this world, unfortunately he doesn't understand humanity needs to die, luckily The Voidra hijacked his account and is sharing it with him. \n\nWe hijack television shows and posts on the internet and show the image of the smile every day. To spread the truth. We even have placed physical images of the smile\u2014that still work\u2014around public places. I then helped them spread the word, help influence others to spread chaos before the void comes to kill us all, and release us of life. Thank you for reading my tale. Thank you for reading long enough for me to access your account.

If you\u2019re reading this, maybe you\u2019ll believe me. Maybe you\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy. But I need someone to know what happened, because I can\u2019t carry this alone anymore. It started six months ago, when I made the worst mistake of my life.\n\nI had been with Sarah for three years. She was kind, patient, the kind of person who\u2019d leave little notes in my lunch bag or stay up late to help me study for my exams. We were happy, or at least I thought we were. But I was stupid, selfish. I started seeing someone else\u2014a coworker named Rachel. It wasn\u2019t serious, just a fling, a rush of excitement I told myself Sarah would never find out about. I was wrong.\n\nSarah started acting strange about a month into the affair. She\u2019d stare at me across the dinner table, her eyes glassy, like she was looking through me. She stopped asking about my day, stopped leaving notes. One night, I came home late from \u201cwork\u201d and found her sitting in the dark, clutching a glass of wine so tightly I thought it would shatter. \u201cWhere were you, Ethan?\u201d she asked, her voice low, almost a growl. I lied, said I was stuck in a meeting. She didn\u2019t respond, just kept staring. That was the first night I felt it\u2014a cold weight in my chest, like something was watching me.\n\nA week later, Sarah was gone. No note, no text, just her side of the closet empty and her car missing. I called her friends, her parents, even the police, but no one knew where she\u2019d gone. I should\u2019ve been worried, but part of me was relieved. No more guilt, no more lies. I could be with Rachel without sneaking around. I was such an idiot.\n\nThe weird stuff started small. I\u2019d wake up to the sound of footsteps in the apartment, slow and deliberate, like someone pacing in the living room. I\u2019d check, but no one was there. Sometimes, I\u2019d hear a faint whisper, too soft to make out, coming from the walls. I told myself it was the neighbors, the pipes, anything to avoid thinking about Sarah. But then the dreams started.\n\nIn the first one, I was standing in a dark forest, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and something sour, like rotting meat. Sarah was there, but she wasn\u2019t herself. Her skin was gray, her eyes sunken, and her mouth stretched into a smile that was too wide, showing too many teeth. She didn\u2019t speak, just pointed at me, her nails long and black, curling like claws. I woke up gasping, my chest burning. The next night, the dream was worse. She was closer, her breath hot and rancid on my face, whispering, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay, Ethan. You\u2019ll pay.\u201d\n\nI tried to move on. Rachel started spending the night, but she noticed things too. She\u2019d wake up screaming, saying she saw a woman standing at the foot of the bed, staring at her. \u201cShe looked like she wanted to kill me,\u201d Rachel said, her voice shaking. I brushed it off, said it was just a nightmare, but I was starting to feel it too\u2014that same cold weight, heavier now, like hands pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nThen the mirrors started changing. I\u2019d catch my reflection and see\u2026 something else. My face, but wrong. My eyes were too small, my mouth twisted, like someone had carved it with a knife. I\u2019d blink, and it would be gone, but the image stayed with me, burned into my mind. Rachel saw it too. One morning, she screamed from the bathroom, and when I ran in, she was sobbing, pointing at the mirror. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she kept saying. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my face.\u201d\n\nRachel left after that. She said she couldn\u2019t handle it, that the apartment felt wrong, like something was living there with us. I didn\u2019t argue. I was starting to feel it too\u2014a presence, always just out of sight, watching, waiting. I stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Sarah\u2019s face from the dreams, her too-wide smile, her claw-like nails. I started drinking to dull the fear, but it didn\u2019t help. Nothing helped.\n\nAbout a month after Sarah disappeared, I found the note. It was tucked under my pillow, written in her handwriting, but the ink was dark, almost black, like it had been mixed with something else. It said, \u201cYou broke my heart, Ethan. Now I\u2019ll break you.\u201d I tore it up, threw the pieces in the trash, but the words stayed with me. That night, I heard her voice for the first time, clear as day, coming from the bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay,\u201d she whispered, over and over, until I was screaming to drown it out.\n\nI started digging, trying to find out where Sarah had gone. I called her parents again, and this time, her mother answered. Her voice was cold, distant. \u201cShe\u2019s not here, Ethan. She\u2019s\u2026 somewhere else. You did this to her.\u201d Before I could ask what she meant, she hung up. I kept searching, asking around, until one of Sarah\u2019s old friends, Mia, finally told me the truth. She looked scared, like just talking about it was dangerous. \u201cSarah went to someone,\u201d Mia said. \u201cA man in the woods, someone people go to when they want\u2026 justice. She was broken, Ethan. You broke her.\u201d\n\nA witch doctor. That\u2019s what Mia called him. A man who could curse people, make them suffer in ways no one could explain. I laughed it off, told her it was nonsense, but deep down, I knew. The footsteps, the whispers, the dreams\u2014they weren\u2019t just in my head. Something was after me, and it was because of Sarah.\n\nThe next night, I saw her. Not in a dream, but in the apartment. I was in the kitchen, pouring another drink, when the lights flickered. The air turned cold, so cold my breath fogged. I turned around, and there she was, standing in the doorway. Her skin was wrong, too tight, like it was stretched over something that wasn\u2019t human. Her eyes were black, not just the irises, but the whole thing, like pools of ink. She didn\u2019t move, just stared, her head tilted at an angle that made my stomach churn. I screamed, dropped the glass, and ran to the bedroom, locking the door. When I looked again, she was gone, but the smell lingered\u2014rotting meat, mixed with something sweet, like perfume.\n\nIt got worse after that. The mirrors didn\u2019t just show warped faces anymore. Sometimes, I\u2019d see her in them, standing behind me, her claws resting on my shoulders. I\u2019d turn, but no one was there. Objects started moving\u2014keys, books, my phone\u2014always ending up in places I hadn\u2019t left them. The whispers never stopped, following me everywhere, even outside the apartment. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay,\u201d she\u2019d say, her voice curling into my skull like smoke.\n\nI tried to leave, to get away, but it followed me. I checked into a motel, but the first night, I woke up to scratches on my arms, deep and jagged, like they\u2019d been carved with a blade. Blood was smeared on the sheets, and the mirror in the bathroom was cracked, a spiderweb of fractures radiating from the center. I moved again, to a friend\u2019s place, but the same thing happened\u2014scratches, whispers, her face in every reflection. I was losing my mind, jumping at shadows, drinking until I passed out just to get a few hours of peace.\n\nLast week, I found another note, this one scratched into the wall above my bed. \u201cNo escape,\u201d it said, the letters uneven, like they\u2019d been clawed into the plaster. That night, the dreams came back, worse than ever. I was in the forest again, but this time, Sarah wasn\u2019t alone. There was a man with her, tall and thin, his face hidden under a hood. His hands were covered in symbols, carved into his skin, glowing faintly red. He didn\u2019t speak, but I felt his eyes on me, like needles piercing my soul. Sarah stood beside him, her smile wider than ever, her teeth sharp and yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said, and the ground opened beneath me, swallowing me into darkness.\n\nI woke up screaming, my throat raw, my body covered in sweat. The scratches on my arms were bleeding again, fresh cuts that hadn\u2019t been there when I went to sleep. I knew then that I couldn\u2019t run anymore. Whatever Sarah had done, whatever she\u2019d asked that man in the woods to do, it was stronger than me. It was everywhere.\n\nI\u2019m writing this now because I saw her again last night, closer than ever. She was sitting on the edge of my bed, her black eyes locked on mine. Her skin was peeling, falling away in strips, revealing something underneath\u2014something dark and writhing, like a mass of worms. She leaned in, her breath choking me with that rotting, sweet smell, and whispered, \u201cTomorrow.\u201d I haven\u2019t slept since. I can hear her now, pacing in the next room, her nails scraping the walls. The lights are flickering again, and the mirrors\u2026 I can\u2019t look at them anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, but I know it\u2019s my fault. I betrayed her, broke her heart, and now she\u2019s breaking me, piece by piece. If you\u2019re reading this, don\u2019t make my mistake. Don\u2019t think you can hurt someone and walk away. Some debts can\u2019t be paid with apologies. Some debts cost everything.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Sarah. I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n[The sound of footsteps stops. The lights go out.]"},"51":{"title":"Real-life Yoshikage Kira?

My friends were talking about Part 4 all the time, and like any good nerd, I binge-watched it straight away. Even without dubbing, it was already addictive, but then it came out dubbed and everyone started talking about how great it was, so I decided to watch it all over again.\n\nIn our class there was a boy who was very excluded. He also liked JoJo, but in a... strange way. He was completely obsessed with Yoshikage Kira, that fissured villain at hand. But this kid took it to a sick level. He was always drawing hands in his notebook, and they were absurdly detailed drawings, like anatomy. People at school said he was \u201cnormal\u201d, because he was autistic and that was just his hyperfocus.\n\nUntil a girl in our class disappeared.\n\nThe next day, the ring she wore every day appeared on her desk, out of nowhere. And the guy was there, drawing another hand. But that hand looked a lot like hers. I had that in my head and mentioned it to my group of friends. At the time, we thought it was just a very bizarre coincidence.\n\nBut two weeks later, three more girls disappeared.\n\nAnd again: their accessories were on the tables. And the kid was drawing their hands. Same details, same bracelets, everything. Then we realized it wasn't a coincidence at all. We gathered the accessories and went straight to the board. We showed everything, the drawings, the coincidences, everything.\n\nThe director took his notebook\u2026 and basically said that we were being prejudiced. He said it was normal, that we didn't understand what autism was, that it was just his hyperfocus and that we needed to have empathy. He guesses? We were punished. They had the nerve to tell us to write an essay about ableism and how we felt about having judged someone with ASD.\n\nA while passed. We kind of left it alone, but we still felt that strange atmosphere. Until one day, over the weekend, one of my friends called me crying. You were in shock. He had found a rotten human hand inside his backpack. It was full of worms, smelly, looked like old meat thrown away. He vomited, cried, he was completely desperate.\n\nIt was there that the penny really dropped. We were dealing with a psychopath. I wasn't just a weird anime fan. He was an obsessed, dangerous crazy person who was repeating what he saw in the anime. A guy with a fascination for hands, just like Kira. But in real life. No comedy, no powers, no stand. Just pure terror.\n\nAnd to this day no one has done anything. The director never investigated. The drawings are gone.

The man appeared to have a mask on and had a gray suit on with gloves and a hat again I didn\u2019t think much of it until he pulled back part of his coat, revealing that he had a revolver inside of it I was shook to my core and started to run and the man started chasing me and as I tried to outrun him, he kept it gaining up on me and at one point I thought I had out ran him and I\u2019d ran into my 24 hour  store that was near  I told one of the workers what happened but they didn\u2019t believe me so I went to  the back and got a drink thinking that maybe I was just hallucinating, but that\u2019s when I heard the sound of the door opening, and when I looked back, I saw the man standing in the store with a revolver out, pointing it at the worker.

I told him to take me to my friends house.(aka his address) and I thought that maybe I out ran that maniac but that would change when the back window shatter and that guy would crawl into the back cab with me just as we pulled to my friends house. He would then tell me that if he wanted my taxi driver live I had to tell him where my other friend was and I never responded before I ran out of the car my friends house, walking in the door, where he was waiting for me.

The drive there wasn't really too intresting or unique , but I will admit , seeing that old mansion looming over the crooked tree's and peeking over the gloomy  greenish sky was quite ominous. when I got to the place it looked even more old and decrepit than it did in the picture , the wall paper and paint was chipped and peeling off , some of the windows were broken or boarded up , there was graffiti and litter all around the entrance, and when I looked up at one of the windows , I swear I saw someone else looking down at me. Despite its decaying look , when I opened that damaged mahogany door , the inside was perfectly spotless , everything in place , everything still bright and lit up , not even the slightess sign of dust or mold anywhere , as if someone cleaned it today , and I noticed all the doors , an entire hallway comprised of doors , so I decided to open one and walk in , And each door I opened something horrific was always lurking behind it. DOOR 1: a forest , with a dark blue stary sky , moon bright and full , but the inhabitants of said forest were the horrific part , there were other people but all of them were nude , and grotesque creatures where getting \"intimate\" with the people , I would describe it as a \"Silent Hill wet dream\" I nearly vommitted at the sight of people tongue kissing amalgamations of flesh , One was something that looked like a hybrid between a horse and a lizard , it had a long snaggle toothed face with a latex bondage hood over its face , and something that looked like an anglerfish lure on its head , it seemed to be moaning in pleasure as people were \"riding\" it , there were other things in there but they made me too sick to explain , That Horse thing was the most tame thing in there . when I shut that door I was shocked , my mind racing a thousand thoughts , it felt like I entered a completley differnt world, the imagery was disturbing to say the least , I decided to open the next door hoping whatever I saw wasn't that. DOOR 2 : a vast landscape of brown sludge, It didn't smell but it did look like feces, a half sunken dining table sat in the middle , pig like creatures were shoving piles of food into their mouths , even when they thew up or the food fell out of their mouths they just picked it up and ate it again , once again a disgusting display , I kept on going into every door.

DOOR 4 : a location that looked like the outside of a volcano , black rock and small bits of magma, it was extremly windy , like a hurricane was taking place , various people were on the ground army crawling or trying to hold on to something as they were being lifted up by the wind , but the strange part was their movements looked reversed , and all I could hear were their distorted ghostly mumblings and cries for help.

Laughter and the sound of children\u2019s voices filled the air as the familiar golden arches beckoned. For ten-year-old Jamie, this was paradise. The smell of fries and burgers wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of soft-serve ice cream. It was a Saturday, and the play place was calling.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jamie shouted, tugging at his mother\u2019s hand as they entered the brightly lit restaurant. His younger sister, Lily, trailed behind, her eyes wide with excitement. The family ordered their meals, and Jamie could hardly contain his glee as he received his Happy Meal, the box adorned with a grinning Ronald McDonald.\n\n\n\nAfter devouring his food, Jamie raced towards the play place, a colorful labyrinth of slides and tunnels. His friends, Max and Sarah, were already there, their laughter echoing as they climbed higher and higher. Jamie joined them, feeling invincible as he navigated the maze.\n\n\n\nBut as the sun dipped below the horizon, the atmosphere shifted. The cheerful jingles of the restaurant faded, replaced by an eerie silence that crept in like a fog. Jamie, unaware of the change, slid down the slide one last time, landing with a thud on the padded floor.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you guys see that?\u201d Max asked, his voice suddenly serious. Jamie looked up, puzzled. The play area, usually filled with joyous screams, felt different now. Shadows danced along the walls, and the vibrant colors seemed to dull.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jamie asked, glancing around. It was then he noticed the statue\u2014Ronald McDonald, the beloved mascot, standing ominously in a corner of the play area. The clown\u2019s painted smile looked too wide, too menacing, and his eyes seemed to glimmer with a life of their own.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go check it out!\u201d Sarah suggested, her voice tinged with excitement. Jamie hesitated, a chill running down his spine. Something about the statue felt wrong, but his friends were already moving toward it.\n\n\n\nAs they approached, the lights flickered, casting long shadows that twisted and writhed like living things. Ronald\u2019s painted face seemed to shift, his smile stretching impossibly wide as if he was anticipating their arrival.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it just me, or does he look\u2026 weird?\u201d Max whispered, his bravado waning. Jamie felt his heart race; he wanted to turn back, but the pull of curiosity was too strong.\n\n\n\n\u201cTouch him!\u201d Sarah dared, her voice a mix of fear and thrill. Jamie felt a knot forming in his stomach. He stepped forward, hand trembling as he reached for the cold, painted surface of Ronald\u2019s shoe.\n\n\n\nThe moment his fingers made contact, a jolt of energy surged through him, and the world around him distorted. The laughter of children faded, replaced by a low, sinister chuckle that echoed in the depths of his mind. The play place around him warped, the colors bleeding into darkness.\n\n\n\n\u201cWelcome, children,\u201d a voice rasped, emanating from the statue itself. Jamie stumbled back, his heart pounding in terror. The eyes of Ronald glowed red, and the once cheerful smile twisted into a grotesque grimace.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlaytime is eternal,\u201d Ronald hissed, his voice dripping with malice. \u201cBut only for those who dare to enter my world.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an instant, the play area transformed. The slides twisted into dark chasms, the tunnels became endless voids, and the vibrant playground morphed into a nightmarish landscape. Jamie turned to run, but the exit had vanished, replaced by a wall of darkness.\n\n\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Jamie screamed, but his voice was swallowed by the shadows. Max and Sarah were nowhere to be seen. Panic surged through him as he realized he was alone, trapped in this twisted version of the place he once loved.\n\n\n\nThe laughter of children echoed around him, but it was no longer joyous. It was taunting, mocking. Jamie stumbled through the maze, searching for a way out, but every turn led him deeper into the nightmare. The once-familiar sounds of the restaurant morphed into whispers, urging him to join the other lost souls.\n\n\n\n\u201cStay and play forever,\u201d the whispers cooed, a chilling lullaby that sent shivers down his spine. \u201cYou\u2019ll never leave.\u201d\n\n\n\nDesperation clawed at him as he sprinted through the darkness, but Ronald\u2019s laughter chased him, echoing in the recesses of his mind. Just when he thought he could escape, he found himself back at the statue, its eyes boring into him with a malevolent glee.\n\n\n\n\u201cJoin us, Jamie,\u201d it beckoned, extending a painted hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be my favorite playmate.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a surge of adrenaline, Jamie turned and ran, tears streaming down his face. He could feel the shadows closing in, the laughter growing louder, more insistent. Just as he thought he would be consumed, he burst through a hidden door, tumbling into the real world.\n\n\n\nGasping for breath, he found himself back in the restaurant, but it was empty. The lights flickered, and the air felt heavy with dread. The cheerful decor was now a fa\u00e7ade, hiding the horror that lurked beneath.\n\n\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d he cried, his voice echoing in the silence. But there was no answer. As he turned to leave, Jamie caught a glimpse of the statue in the corner, its eyes glowing with a wicked light, and he knew\u2014he could never escape Ronald\u2019s grasp.\n\n\n\nThe last Happy Meal had turned into a nightmare, and now he was part of the play place forever, lost in the shadows of McDonald\u2019s, where laughter turned to screams, and Ronald McDonald awaited his next unsuspecting victim."},"57":{"title":"Part III \u2013 Signs Under the Flesh: The Expansion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kjn8js\/part_iii_signs_under_the_flesh_the_expansion\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Asedrez13","selftext":"Three months after the explosion at Estancia do C\u00e9u, terror surpassed the limits of Pedra Branca.

One of the babies was caught staring directly at a security camera for seven hours straight \u2014 without blinking.\n\nA group of renegade scientists, led by physicist Ot\u00e1vio Malik, began publishing secret reports on deep web forums.

They claimed that these entities were awakening through human biomass.\n\nThe government tried to deny it.

Blue. Weightless.  \nThe kind of morning that makes the birds too loud and the breeze feel rehearsed.  \nI packed the basket carefully\u2014burned one biscuit, chilled one, left the last just warm enough to comfort.  \nI even tied the ribbon like I used to.\n\nI thought it would be simple.

Vines crept through shattered windows, and rust painted the playground equipment in hues of decay. It was here that I stumbled upon a dusty, old VHS tape, its label faded and barely legible. But the familiar golden arches and the faint outline of a clown drew me in, igniting a morbid curiosity.\n\n\n\nI had heard whispers about this place, tales of strange happenings and eerie sounds that echoed through the night. But nothing could prepare me for what awaited inside. As I brushed away the grime and popped the tape into an ancient VCR, I felt a shiver of anticipation wash over me. The screen flickered to life, revealing a vibrant, cartoonish world filled with oversized burgers and dancing fries.\n\n\n\nThe cheerful jingle echoed through my dimly lit living room, but something was off. The colors were too bright, the laughter too manic. I leaned closer, captivated and unnerved as the cartoon characters began to promote an insatiable hunger, encouraging viewers to eat until they could eat no more. \u201cMore fries! More shakes! More everything!\u201d they sang, their eyes wide and gleaming with an unnatural fervor.\n\n\n\nAs the cartoon progressed, the scenes grew increasingly grotesque. Characters who indulged too much began to swell, their bodies distorting in cartoonish horror. Laughter turned to screams as they burst, blood and viscera splattering across the screen in a surreal display of gluttony gone wrong. I recoiled, heart racing, but couldn't tear my eyes away. The laughter of the characters morphed into a cacophony of manic glee, a chorus of voices urging me to join them in their feast.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the screen flickered again, and the cheerful clown, Ronald, turned his gaze directly toward me. His painted smile twisted into a sinister grin, and his eyes glowed with a malevolent hunger. \u201cYou\u2019re next!\u201d he exclaimed, his voice echoing through the room as if he were right beside me. I felt a chill crawl down my spine; the cartoon was no longer just a show\u2014it felt like a warning.\n\n\n\nI tried to turn off the tape, but the remote slipped from my grasp, clattering to the floor. The screen pulsed with vibrant colors, and the characters began to chant my name, their voices growing louder, more insistent. \u201cCome eat with us! Come feast forever!\u201d The room darkened, shadows creeping along the walls, and I could feel a weight pressing down on me, a tangible hunger that clawed at my insides.\n\n\n\nPanicking, I lunged for the VCR, but the tape had become a living thing, its coils writhing like snakes. The laughter intensified, drowning out my thoughts, and I could feel the pull of the cartoon world. It was intoxicating, a promise of endless indulgence, but I knew it was a lie. I could feel my stomach churn, the hunger rising within me, and I fought against it with every ounce of will I had left.\n\n\n\nIn a final desperate attempt, I yanked the tape from the VCR, but the screen continued to flicker, the characters still beckoning me. \u201cJoin us! Join us!\u201d they screamed, their voices now a cacophony of madness. I stumbled back, the tape slipping from my fingers and crashing to the ground. It shattered, and in that moment, the laughter ceased.\n\n\n\nSilence enveloped the room, but the silence was deafening. I stood frozen, heart racing, as the realization hit me. I was alone, but the hunger still lingered, gnawing at the edges of my mind. I could still hear their voices, whispering promises of satisfaction, of a feast that would never end.\n\n\n\nWeeks passed, and I tried to forget the horrors I had witnessed, but the tape had left its mark. I found myself drawn to fast food, unable to resist the siren call of greasy fries and sugary sodas. Each meal felt like a step closer to the abyss, a descent into a world where hunger ruled supreme.\n\n\n\nOne fateful night, I returned to that abandoned McDonald's, the urge overwhelming. As I stepped inside, the air was thick with the scent of fried food, and the laughter echoed in my ears. The playground loomed like a twisted carnival, and I could see the shadows of the cartoon characters dancing in the corners of my vision.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome feast with us,\u201d they whispered, and I knew I would. I would join them, consumed by the hunger that had taken root in my soul. I stepped into the darkness, the laughter welcoming me home as the door creaked shut behind me, sealing my fate.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, the townsfolk would find the old McDonald's still standing, but the laughter would be gone, replaced by an eerie silence.

A nose twisting sideways. A mouth appearing too high, too wide, too small\u2014then gone. Every time it starts to resemble a face, it distorts again. Your brain tries to resolve it.

No moon.\nOnly awareness. The suffocating sense that your existence has broken something.\n\nLike waking up in someone else\u2019s dream.\n\nAnd then\u2014\nA sound.\n\nNot a scream. Not a word.\nA tone.\nLow. Distant.

Watching. Unmoving.\nNot angry. Not curious.\nJust\u2026 acknowledging.\n\nAnd deep in your soul, a thought forms.\nNot your own.\nA whisper without voice.\n\n\u201cI am not supposed to be here.\u201d\n"},"76":{"title":"Need help finding creepypasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kizvk1\/need_help_finding_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"pasiveagresivepostit","selftext":"Im trying to find the name of a creepypasta i listened to a few years ago I've searched everything and i can't find it.

I have seen many inspiring things on this forum and have decided that now is the time for me to share my own experience, with hope it can inspire others.\n\nBefore I begin, it is important to remember that perception is reality. How you are raised shapes so much of who you are, and the way you view the world. Seeing as this is a forum for people like me, I may not need to explain that.

If not tonight then tomorrow morning so please be patient if I cannot get through the full story all at once.\n\nBefore I begin, I just want to make clear to you all this simple message.\n\nYou can leave.

I rolled down the ocean of tall grasses and stopped face up at the bank. Looking skyward and feeling the warm winds whip against my cheek, I lounged daydreaming up at the clouds.\n\nMy dreams, much like the rest of my childhood, had always been so calm and comforting. They were so vibrant in their peace and serenity that at times I longed to sleep, to rejoin that other worldly place and its many dreamscapes. I had often thought about it before, and have often since, how fascinating it is that in dreams you do not necessarily see things. It is more a feeling you get from your dream, and your mind simply generates images to match. You get the feeling of falling, or of something chasing you, and that gives you the images of coming closer to earth, or of a monster. Nightmares.\n\nI did not have nightmares. Like most children, other girls in the village did have nightmares. Nightmares were explained to me, but I did not have terrors to call my own. My dreams seemed constantly filled with ethereal places of heavenly, bright vivid visages of wanderlust brought on by a constant sense of tranquility.\n\nI had always dreamed this way, until I didn\u2019t. What\u2019s strange is that in those final weeks in the village my dreams had changed, but at the same time they had not. Where I once dreamed of my wind-swept oceans of tall grasses feeding into mountains and meadows, I now saw only the same things every time I closed my eyes. I saw things I had never seen before. Things that contrasted so harshly to all I had ever known.\n\nIn those dreams I saw cold dark earth packed against red stone walls. I saw a mother who had hair about her face. Mostly, I saw the well. Other images came and went through my dreams in those last few weeks, but the one constant was the well. A well with black brackish waters in a dark place. Always dark. The well with waters that would move up and over you as they slowly transcended upwards out of the well in small beads, sweating from the surface. I remember the feeling that these small perspirations were at the same time calling to me as they were comforting me. They hungered for me to touch them. In every dream I approached the well, but I never touched it or its waters. Whenever I awoke from these dreams, I remember feeling so odd. Not from the dreams themselves, but from the feelings they gave me. These things when said out loud to Mother should have been frightening. So foreign and dark to the only world I had ever known; and yet somehow, I felt the same comfort as I had when traversing my normal temples of trees and green vistas. Maybe for the same reasons I have heard people love to watch wild horses, I loved the well dream. The thing I could not control. The thing I wanted to know more about that always evaded me.\n\nMy mother did not have much to say about these dreams. She merely brushed them off and told me it was a normal part of growing older. We couldn\u2019t always dream of the meadows.\n\nOn that day, as I laid on the beach of the marshland beyond, I slipped again into that same dream, and dreamt as I often had in those weeks. I dreamt of the well, and of its waters calling out to me once more. I approached closer than I ever had before. I willed myself to reach out and touch the bubbly baubles. To  run and to leap into those waters. Yet in my dream, my slow approach never faltered as I drew steadily closer to the well. I felt myself coming to a precipice, about to finally understand what it meant in some way to learn its secrets. I saw my hand climb from my side and stretch out to the surface, coming close to peering over the edge. As I reached the climax of the dream, ready to view the depths of the pool, I felt myself lurch from my slumber once more, its secrets escaping me.\n\n\u201cVilina! Wake up!\u201d\n\nI jolted from the dream. My sister Blanche\u2019s pale face stared down at me with disapproving eyes.\n\nThe wind carried her golden hair across her face, which she primly swept and placed neatly back in order as I sat up.\n\n\u201cAsleep again? Always asleep,\u201d she scolded.\n\n\u201cI was so close! So close to knowing! I could feel it!\u201d I said without veiling my exasperation.\n\n\u201cSo close to nothing,\u201d she chided.\n\n\u201cIts just a dream. We all have the dream. The mothers say we all get them as we get older,\u201d she spoke factually and without condescension.\n\nI knew Blanche did not approve of my many trips through the forests, or of my general curious and lackadaisical habits. However, being perfect as she was, it was not in her to be snide or rude. She had never shared her own feelings on the matter, or of my actions.\n\n\u201cBlanche is right you know,\u201d said Agnes.\n\nI looked to see Agnes staring off towards the marsh with the same look of mistrust and concern she gave most things.\n\n\u201cWe all have the dreams. Mother says even if they terrify us there is nothing to fear,\u201d she continued, her head tilted as she more carefully inspected a frog hopping off into the murk with a little more disgust.\n\nLuckily for Agnes, at that moment we all turned as we heard the beginning of the call. The afternoon beginning of the chapel services, and the melodic hum traveling across the valley to all corners.\n\nBlanche sighed, no doubt anxiously awaiting her eventual visit through those doors and an end to the longing. Longing for the communion with Him she had long been promised. She stared off in the direction of the village, lingering just a second before regaining her composure.\n\n\u201cWe are all too old for this sort of prattle. Any day now we will have our descendance,\u201d said Blanche. \u201cWe will meet Him and see the world beyond. We are far too old to be concerned with dreams and fears. The only thing we need be concerned with is how best to serve Him in all ways and uphold the faith as Mother always says.\u201d\n\nPlacing her hands on her knees, she sat perfectly poised for a moment before softening her face with a smile and looked down to me.\n\nI was amazed at the way she harnessed the ability to preach at us while always maintaining her calm, sweet, motherly demeanor. It was as if she was perpetually practicing the balance, to slip into the perfect motherly role she was destined for. If nothing else could be said, we could all know that Blanche wanted nothing more than to be a mother herself and raise a daughter of her own.\n\nShe saw me staring up at her, pondering the thought while laying lazily in the sand. I\u2019m sure I had a look of indifference to the sermon.\n\nMother or not, she looked at me rolling her eyes as she spoke.\n\n\u201cCome now, lets get back before service finishes to help with the end of day chores.\u201d\n\nStanding, she held out her hand to me.\n\nIt was my turn to roll my eyes as I took her hand and she helped me to my feet.\n\nHer face turned to confusion as our eyes met, and she looked down.\n\nShe turned my hand over and I saw her eyes widen.\n\nI looked down to see what alarmed her, and took in the sight of my own palm. There was dried blood mixed with the sand sticking to a fresh cut.\n\nBefore I could even react, she was dragging me to the waters edge. She began vigorously rinsing my hand in the cold murky waters.\n\nAnges yelped at the sight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t touch the marsh. We don\u2019t touch the marsh. You know that! WE DO NOT TOUCH THE MARSH!\u201d\n\nAnges was working herself into a frenzy.\n\nBlanche\u2019s eyes were wide with panic; however, her voice was still as the waters had been before our interruption.\n\n\u201cWe have to clean it. Maybe, if we clean it there wont be a cut. Maybe you just put your hand in something,\u201d she said.\n\nFrantically she went on waving my hand in the waters.\n\nI already knew she was wrong. I must have gotten the cut while rolling down the bank, but even now I don\u2019t remember feeling when it happened. I do however, remember the sting I felt as the waters of the marsh entered my hand. These were not the tranquil calling waters of the well. These were fresh embers, the burning felt from the cold liquid sent a small prickle up my wrist, and I pulled away from her.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d, she called as I walked back up the bank.\n\n\"The water. The boundaries. You both know the rules. The marsh and the valley apex. It is forbidden. You both know. You know this.\" Agnes was spiraling, dwindling out. She knelt on the ground. She still had not moved an inch closer to the marsh or toward us. Dejectedly she repeatedly whispered as she stared at the ground, \"You know\u2026 You know\u2026\"\n\nThe gash was a couple inches across my palm. Given it had been some time since it happened, with Blanche's cleaning it wasn't even bleeding anymore.\n\n\"Let me see it, I said!\", came Blanche, grasping for my hand once more.\n\nI pulled away again to face her.\n\n\"I am fine. Its fine!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not fine Vilina! You know it\u2019s not fine, the desce\u2026\"\n\n\"IT. IS. FINE!\u201d, I yelled. Taking a breath, I straightened. \u201cYou sound like her.\"\n\nI pointed at Agnes who sat still mumbling, now too low to hear.\n\n\"SHE. IS. RIGHT!\" screamed Blanche emphatically, finally losing the cool poise of the perfect promised child. \"I know she's right, and so do you. We don\u2019t touch the marsh, or go beyond the boundary of the valley's apex. Exiting or going beyond the boundaries before descendance is forbidden. We all know this. You also cannot damage yourself. I only want to help you. We need to find a way to fix this. To hide it if we must.\u201d\n\nThere was a part of me that was touched by her act to help save me. At the same time I thought about how much of that may be self-preservation. We were meant to be three pure sisters descending as a trio, as He wished.\n\nMy eyes narrowed.\n\n\"This is hardly my first scrape, let alone on my hands.\"\n\nI pulled up my skirts to show the pale lines and years of healed damage. My arms were much the same. I had been lucky that my hands had never seemed to be harmed. Added to the fact that injuries were easily concealed in a world where Mothers did not scan over every inch of you. We all wore the white linens from wrist to ankle. People were more inclined to believe you just caught your dress on a snag than you had been injured, so long as you cleaned the fabric well before arriving back home. I had become excellent at cleaning and mending by this point.\n\nThis also wasn't my first time in the marsh. I had spent many a clandestine afternoon wading through the wetlands and sunbathing on the further bank when I knew no one was looking for me. I treasured my stolen afternoons while Blanche devoted more time to housework, and Agnes to fetching up her mother\u2019s skirts. However, I chose not kick that hornet\u2019s nest.\n\n\"I just don't see why He would care at all about a few scrapes over the years, Blanche. Why would He care?\"\n\nBlanche's mouth dropped.\n\n\"We are all meant to come to him as pure as we were born. That is His will. How could you be so careless with all of our futures?\", she said flatly.\n\n\"Because it doesn't matter.\"\n\nYou would think my words had been a knife to her belly.\n\n\"These rules. They are just words. I did worry once, about the first small knick I received. Then nothing happened. As I grew older, I realized no one checks me. No one cares. It does not matter, Blanche.\"\n\nI don't know if she even heard my second reply, as she still seemed to be recovering from the first time I told her it did not matter.\n\n\u201cWhat of the Mother\u2019s cuts? What of their hands? He seems fine with that.\u201d\n\nShe swallowed back whatever disgust she had at my admissions and admonishments.\n\n\"I sincerely hope you're right, Vilina. I hope you don't come to regret this when you meet Him. I hope we all don't come to regret it,\" she said, choosing to ignore my comments about the mothers hands. We all knew not to speak of them.\n\nShe took a breath, and then I saw something change in her for a moment. Something passed the preachy perfect sister I had always known. Her eyes read hurt.\n\n\"I do wish you would have told me. I would have told you.\"\n\nAs quickly as the hurt had shown, it was gone. She dusted off her dress and looked at Agnes. She spoke kind and stern as always, ever the mother again.\n\n\"Come now Agnes, you will be okay. One way or another we must not speak of this. What is done is done. We have not done wrong and have to pray He will know our piety above all when we are weighed and judged by Him. In the end, all are to serve His will, not our own.\"\n\nThis last jab she threw hit home at that moment. She knew it would sting, as those words were not just spoken out of anger. The words were my mother\u2019s words, spoken to me many times through the years. No matter how many times I strayed the path, they had not stopped me from myself. Hearing my mothers own counsel, I wasn't just letting Him down, I was letting Mother down.\n\nBlanche walked up and over the bank holding Agnes\u2019 hand. They headed back through the forest guided by the rising rhythmic hum of His call.\n\nThey were easy words for Blanche to say as an attempt to hurt me, but what did she know? She had never known anything beyond her teachings. She had never felt the call of the wild as I had, never felt the pull from the peaks around us. Blanche had never longed for more than she was allowed. She never hoped for more.\n\nStrengthened in my resolve, I picked myself up and made haste, determined to catch up with my sisters on the path back to the village.\n\nI caught up to them at the foot of the forest that acted as barrier to the meadows. We did not talk of my hand, or of the marsh again.\n\nAs we wound through the path we talked of chores. As always, I found it difficult to focus on turning in the animals, washing, candle lighting, dinner preparation, etc. I did my best to act excited to gather the eggs and clean our chicken coup, though I hated the thought. The hens always pecked at me as I nimbly inspected their nests for eggs. Not to mention the feeling of fear I felt at the thought of running into Stosh. I didn\u2019t have anything that made me feel fear like the other girls did from their dreams, but if I did have nightmares it would surely have been from that rooster.\n\nI shook off the thought, and put on a smile as we weaved through the woods. At last we reached the point of the forest that began to thin, the trees making way for grasses and then nothing but dirt with pink and white pedals.\n\nThe apex of the valley was marked all around us by large flowering dogwood. In the spring each year they started to drop their blossoms. The petals rode the wind to bless us with their spectacle each year, a welcome reminder of just how much I loved home. If the wilds were the waves of my daydreams, then the village was my port. A place to always return, rest, and repeat.\n\nFor some reason the grass and forest refused to overtake the village. I never saw anyone have to clear or remove the woods to make way for new homes, or pens. However, the petals never seemed to care and always blessed us with their beauty. A light dusting always covered the ground through summer, offering a carpet of color to brighten the many dirt pathways and thatched rooftops of the hundreds of small dwellings within the village.\n\nAs we crossed the threshold of the village we saw the other girls already hurrying about their nightly chores. We wound through the homes, and passed by Kori, Reina, and Gabriel. Reina and Blanche had a long standing unspoken feud, the most awkward standoff that I had ever seen. It was a battle for supremacy, to determine who could be more ideal. It was odd, because they did not openly dislike each other.\n\nWe all walked the same path in opposite directions, two sets of three sisters. We met abruptly, staring at one another. We let the two saintly sally\u2019s do the talking.\n\n\u201cBlanche,\u201d said Reina, bobbing her head slowly in acknowledgment.\n\n\u201cReina,\u201d said Blanche, mimicking her to perfection.\n\nThe two prefects stood at attention, mirroring each other in every way down to their golden hair and clasped hands at their navels.\n\n\u201cWe are off to prepare for our Mother\u2019s dinner before we receive His word,\u201d said Reina.\n\n\u201cWe are off to do much the same, except we also plan to bed the animals and get a head start on tomorrows chores. Sorry, we can\u2019t stay to chat. We had better hurry off, mustn\u2019t waste the remainder of the chapel services. As He wills, we look to the future.\u201d\n\nI looked at Blanche with a groan. We never discussed getting a head start on tomorrows work. I for one would not have been in favor, but I did my best to say nothing. I didn't need any more sermons tonight.\n\nBlanche\u2019s comment made Reina\u2019s eye twitch ever so slightly, interrupting the staring contest, and like that it was over.\n\n\u201cMay your descent come soon, and may you all be found worthy,\u201d they both said in unison. The three girls parted way for us, and we walked past them nodding to each other as we did.\n\nI picked up my skirts as Blanche quickened her pace. She strode with her long legs, and the harmony of quick deliberate motion coupled with upright rigidness gave her a weightless quality. Floating, she moved ahead of us with a grace we could not match.\n\nAgnes, seemed always ready for the way that Blanche moved with purpose throughout the village. Trusting Blanche to be her eyes, she kept hers to the ground looking for the imperceivable threats looming to make her take a tumble as she flew.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand that girl,\u201d I breathed, as soon as we turned a corner.\n\n\u201cYou ought not to speak like that about anyone, Vilina,\u201d Blanche said.\n\n\u201cI know you hate her too. All of her comments about hoping we descend soon! She might as well just say she wants to be rid of us already.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nice thing to say,\u201d said Agnes with a sigh.\n\n\u201cI see what she is really saying, and you both know it\u2019s true,\u201d I spat at the ground. I also couldn't afford to look up at this point, with this pace.\n\n\u201cI for one am not trying to say that I hope they descend soon to be rid of her. It is simply the proper thing to say,\u201d said Blanche, as she came to a stop.\n\nAgnes and I almost toppled as we slid to a halt and bumped into one another. Looking up I saw why Blanche had stopped. We were at the point in our route that took us closest to the chapel. I could see the plainly colored white wood boards that made up its walls, otherwise unadorned. My eyes traveled over the great double doors beyond the stairs that Blanche daydreamed of climbing one day. The doors were bathed in a green light, the only such light in all of the village. When I thought about this building I really only had three questions. What made that light green? What was beyond the doors that made the chapel forbidden to girls and not mothers? I pondered the third question, as my eyes raised to look at the chimney above the steepled roof. There was the same steady stream of smoke rising from the chimney that never seemed to cease no matter the time of day or the weather. Blanche turned back to me.\n\n\u201cI am not trying to say that I hope she descends soon to be rid of her,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI do hope she descends soon. Just not before me.\u201d She smiled a smile that touched her eyes before redoubling the mad pace from before.\n\nAgnes and I sighed and took off at a run after her. She may have been able to keep that pace without running or looking foolish, but I am sure Agnes and I looked like idiots.\n\nWe came to our home at last. Without speaking, we all went our separate ways and made for the chores previously discussed.\n\nAgnes broke for the washing, and Blanche for the cooking. I ran straight for the hen pen, but as soon as I was around the back of the house I stopped running and took in a deep breath.\n\nSitting still, tall, and proud was Stosh. With all two feet of his mustered height, the rooster crowed defiantly.\n\n\u201cHis will,\u201d I said with a sigh. I walked forward into battle.\n\nThirty minutes later and a few additional snags in my linens, I returned to the house carrying the nightly round of eggs. I almost dropped the delivery when I saw all three mothers already home.\n\nAgnes sat wide eyed in a chair near Mother Ailsa, who seemed to be speaking slowly to calm her. Blanche was hugging Mother Beatrice. She overflowed with joyful laughter while trying her best to maintain a semblance of grace.\n\nI was confused, until my own mother stood from a chair next to the door. Mother Genevieve looked to me and said what I should have known already.\n\n\u201cMy child, your time has come. Tomorrow will be the day of your descendance.\u201d\n\nI did not react as my sisters did. Agnes responded in fear, Blanche in joy, but I did not know how to feel. I searched my thoughts, and couldn\u2019t determine where I stood between the two. The concept just seemed foreign. Sure, one day I would descend; but that was \u201csome day\u201d. Now that \u201csome day\u201d was tomorrow, I felt torn. Mother Genevieve must have seen the look of consternation. She came to forward, wrapping her arms around me in an embrace. She pulled my head close to her chest, her long stark white hair encasing me.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of you my daughter,\u201d she whispered softly. Her words were a gift just for me. She gently patted my back with one hand, the other stroking my hair delicately.\n\nI pulled back just enough to look up into her wise old eyes.\n\n\u201cI hope I can make you proud tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n\nI meant it. I hoped I would be able to descend. With the reality of the day settling in, I remembered that my fate was not only tied to my sisters, but also to Mother. I was an extension of her, after all.\n\n\u201cYou will. I know you will,\u201d she said with a soft, warm smile.\n\nShe went to hug me again, and as she did I saw past her. I took in the scene of my sisters different emotional states.\n\nBy now, Blanche had moved to comforting Agnes with Mother Ailsa. Mother Beatrice stood with hands on hips, a monument to rigid impatience. She looked in my direction with that same look she had given me my entire life. Unbridled, exasperated contemptuousness lit in her eyes.\n\n\u201cOne of them cries. The other looks like a lost fawn!\u201d, she said throwing her hands in the air. \u201cWe have spent their entire lives preparing them for this moment. You would think there would be more gratitude. In His name. I told you both that you have been to lax with these two. Especially this one,\u201d she said pointing at me.\n\nIt would only serve that the Mother who had raised excellency would have high standards, but Mother Beatrice took this to a different plane. Needless to say as a girl who wasn\u2019t known for following His teachings quite so strictly, I was always a target for a good sermon. Or condemnation.\n\n\u201cWe all handle the descendence in our own way, Beatrice,\u201d said Genevieve.\n\n\u201cThis one hasn't handled anything, ever,\u201d she returned flatly.\n\n\u201cI think she is handling it just fine. We never know when our day will come, or what His will is until He shows us,\u201d my mother said, now turning and giving that same soft smile to Beatrice.\n\nI loved it when she preached lightly back to her. This wasn\u2019t just another set of sisters we watched wrapped in a contended battle of devotion as before. No, this was two titans of divinity.\n\nActing unfazed, Beatrice approached.\n\n\u201cThe trio must serve their purpose as one. If she does not do her part, this will all have been for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will be fine. As will sweet Agnes,\u201d said Genevieve, gracing the timid girl with a nod of approval.\n\n\u201cThey will go. They will descend as He wills, one way or another it will be done,\u201d said Ailsa quietly as she stood. She spread the creases from her linens with far more creased and crevassed fingers.\n\nThis was unlike her. Each mother had a different way of dealing with things. My own mother had a philosophy of fighting Beatrice\u2019s icy demeanor with warmth and an occasional spark of flame. Agnes\u2019 mother chose to handle her with a casual nonchalance, like she did all things. More often then not, just choosing to let her cold stare drill into her uncaring face.\n\nAilsa let out a long, deep breath and walked from the room with a slow tired gait. She made clear she had nothing more to say or add. Her silence carried enough weight of its own.\n\nAgnes looked like a fish out of water. Looking around in dismay, she stood quickly.\n\n\u201cGoodnight sisters. Goodnight mothers,\u201d she said quickly. She almost tripped on her dress as she tried to curtsy while turning to leave in pursuit of her mother.\n\nEven Blanche\u2019s mother seemed stunned to see Ailsa partake in the discussion at all with such finality. However, that shock did not last long. She shook it off quickly and restored her fury to me.\n\n\u201cShe better make it Genevieve. Blanche deserves better,\u201d she fumed. She called for Blanche to accompany her, and stormed off.\n\nBlanche hurried to follow, but not before giving me an apologetic look.\n\n\u201cGoodnight Sister. Goodnight Mother Genevieve. Thank you for all you have done for me. For all of us,\u201d she said. I could tell she was still overjoyed and despite the heated exchange she still couldn't set aside her own excitement for the next days events.\n\nShe curtsied her respect, and quickly padded off to follow her mother.\n\nWe took our leave then, and as usual Mother walked me to my room. Like every other night, as I prepared my night clothes she sat at the edge of my bed humming quietly. Mother closed her eyes as she swayed there to that melody. It was as though she drifted off in her own special place. It is a memory I still take with me always. Something to comfort me to sleep each night, even now.\n\n\u201cAre you nervous my child?\u201d, she asked as I slipped into bed.\n\n\u201cI am. I just want to satisfy Him.\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cYou will Vilina. You will. I have faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will happen tomorrow, Mother?\u201d, I asked.\n\nShe paused looking down at me as her lips pulled to a line. She looked even older than usual. It was as if the smile vanishing on my kindly mothers face was a sign that all of the exuberance she had left had been depleted, leaving a husk of the sweet fruit she had been.\n\n\u201cYou know I cannot tell you that,\u201d she said. Her tender look and smile returned, but it seemed to take some effort or unknown toll from her.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t know what to do? What happens if I make a mess of things? I don\u2019t want to ruin things, or to disappoint you.\u201d\n\nShe maintained her patient kindness, but I could tell somewhere behind that smile something was troubling her. She chewed my words. Nodding to herself she seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\u201cMy daughter, my Lamb. I must confess that no other Mother has ever truly loved a daughter as I do so love you, my child.\u201d\n\nShe paused a moment. Her eyes took me in, and then looked about the room as if to just take in the moment. Seeing no one else, she took a deep breath and whispered to me. She spoke in a rush, in a tone that not even the walls were meant to hear.\n\n\u201cBecause of the depth of my love for you Vilina, I must tell you something. Something that I should not.\u201d\n\nMy head cocked to the side, but before I could speak, Mother Genevieve leaned in closely. Even though she was whispering directly into my ear, her voice was so hushed I thought even the light wind outside would surely take the words away.\n\n\u201cIn the most difficult moments.\n\nTake heed my words.\n\nGive in completely.\n\nHave faith forever my child.\u201d\n\nShe pushed out each line quickly like a spear which attacked my mind the moment it left her and entered me. As quickly as the conspiratorial possession overtook her, it seemed to pass as she pulled away and stood. She once again spoke busily of mundane nightly duties.\n\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d, she said.\n\nI was still reeling trying to understand.\n\n\u201cI shall fetch you something small before bed.\u201d\n\nShe walked out of the room. I was left in the vacuum created in the wake of her words, words that ran rampant through my head. Spinning, I replayed every line.\n\n\u201cIn the most difficult moments.\n\nTake heed my words.\n\nGive in completely.\n\nHave faith forever my child.\u201d\n\nWhat made this odd was that there was nothing out of the ordinary in anything she said.\n\nNothing made sense, because it all made too much sense. She had told me these things almost daily for my entire life.\n\nI had always been a wanderer. It was difficult for me to fall in line. Difficult to conform to the dresses, chores, routines, and rituals that all the other girls seemed to have no issue adhering to. Because of this, Mother had often told me to heed her words, to give in to Him, be forever in faith, and to follow His will. She had even said this in front of my sisters and the other mothers many, many times. These things were openly taught; not just to me, but to all of us during the many seasons of life.\n\nWe were always meant to have faith in His teachings, even though as girls we did not yet know Him. Every girl in the village knew that during difficult winters, pain, or any hardship, our mothers faith was strong. We never lost faith in them, and our mothers never lost faith in Him.\n\nWhy would she say such a thing, and in such a way? The question plagued me.\n\nShe returned to my bed with a small portion of bread and cheese. Handing it to me I could tell that she knew I was vexed. However, along with all other great conspirators, we held a commonality. The unspoken trust that what had been said, had been said quietly and in such a way as to never be mentioned again.\n\nShe sat humming a version of the call at the edge of my bed while I ate. It was my turn to take in that moment now. Seeing her there, I ate slowly. I hoped she would say something else to make it all make sense, but in the end I finished my plate and handed it back to her. She stood, kissed my forehead, and smiled at me one last time before leaving the room without another word.\n\nI laid awake mulling the meaning of Mothers words repeatedly until His real nightly call came crashing through the village. The low thrum of the tone reverberated in the small space. The walls shook and my bed pulsed as it lulled me to sleep. In my slumber I floated off to be filled with more dark, moist memories."},"78":{"title":"The South Korean Haunting That Spread Worldwide","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiuppu\/the_south_korean_haunting_that_spread_worldwide\/","flair":"Video","author":"AdOutrageous4892","selftext":"In the early 2000s, a haunting in South Korea's elevators began \u2014 and it didn't stay there for long.

What happened? Rolled what? Your ankle?\" Asked Danny in a quick worried tone.\n\n\"Yea he tripped over the curb and busted his ass\" replied Tim\n\n\"Damn dude glad you're okay\" Danny replied.\n\n\"Thanks\" replied Jim \n\n\"Here help me with this\" said Jeff while attempting to lift a rack of clothing \"we'll block the door with it\" \n\nThe group worked to slide the rack across the wooden floor and in front of the shattered door. \n\nAs soon as we had finished moving it into place an spine tingling scream could be heard above the other ambient horror that filled the air. \n\nI found the nerve to walk over to the wooden shade that hung on the store front and peered through the slit in between the slats. What I witnessed still flashes in my dreams from time to time. \n\nWhat I watched was the swarming of a poor woman out on the street. As I looked on in horror the woman's face came into view under the dim street light. \n\nThe horror and pain contorted her face in odd extreme poses but even then I could still see her stunning beauty slipping through. The woman that I witnessed being mauled was one of the bartenders from the bar I had been talking with. \n\nIn a moment of disbelief I slid my hand into my pocket and allowed my fingers to tighten around a piece of napkin that had contained the poor woman's phone number. \n\nMy mind tried and failed to cope with the situation unraveling in front of my very eyes. An attempt that was short lived as Marco layed a hand on my shoulder and pulled my eyes away from the horror show\n\nHe held a finger to his mouth before saying \"shhh.. there's a noise in the back room...find something to fight with!\" \n\n\"Oh for the love of god\" I though while allowing my eyes to survey the small shop.\n\nI noticed a large wooden paddle mounted to the wall with the writing of \"Close to perfect, Far from normal\" printed across the face.\n\n\"Yea no shit\" I muttered quietly to myself while unhooking it from the wall and wielding it in front of me. \n\nTurning to face the group I noticed they had all armed themselves with small stools and a fire extinguisher. \n\nThat's when I heard the noise from the back room of the store. It sounded like someone stumbling around and a faint growl could be heard. The sound of what I could only assume was the handle of a broom striking the ground sent a jolt of noise through the quiet store.\n\n\n\"Well what the fuck do we do?\" Wispered Danny. \n\n\"Well can't go out the front, so I don't think we have a choice\" muttered Marco.\n\nI could feel the sweat flowing down my head and dripping off my chin. The heartbeat in my ears boomed overshadowing the sounds of my heavy breathing. \n\n\"Fuck\" I said quietly \"il do it just get ready to back me up\" \n\n\"We got your back brother\" replied Marco \n\nTaking a deep breath I slowly walked to the thin wooden door that acted as the last barrier between me and whatever monstrosity lay behind it. \n\nI grabbed the handle shakily while turning back to face my friends, finding them all attentively watching me.\n\nCounting too three in my head I ripped the door open and raised the paddle. \n\nAs the door slid open and bounced against the stopper a large raccoon shot out of the darkness and bounded between my legs out into the shop floor. \n\n\"Fuck!\" Yelled Danny as the little creature latched onto his foot and began trying to crawl up his leg. \n\n\"Get this fucking thing off me!\" He exclaimed in a frantic outburst. \n\nTim grabbed the animal by the tail in an attempt to pull it from Danny's knee but the raccoon turned and bore down on his hand with its sharp little teeth. \n\n\"Ouch!\" Yelled Tim as he pulled his hand away from the animals mouth. \n\nMarco finally stepped in and removed the animal from Danny's leg. The raccoon was sent flying through the air and landed on top of a clothing rack which toppled over and shattered the front window of the store spilling glass and a few t-shirts into the street.\n\n\"Oh shit\" I muttered as the realization set in. The noise had alerted the nightmares that stood outside and they were now attempting to enter the store. A feat that would no longer be a difficult one. \n\nI quickly surveyed the back room finding a small window above a computer desk. \"Boys we gotta go now, in here!\" I said while motioning to the small room. \n\nAfter entering the room we closed the thin wooden door behind us just in time to see the first of the infected crawl through the shards of broken glass and over the clothing rack. \n\nI began working to get the window open while Danny and Jeff slid the small computer desk over in front of the door. \n\nFreeing the locks from their resting spots and lifting the window I used a short rod to prop it open then began ushering Jim and Tim outside. \n\nJim had a little difficulty due to his newly acquired lower body injury and Tim left a small smear of blood on the white windowsill from the raccoon bite.\n\nAs Marco crawled through the window a tremendous crash could be heard on the other side of the door. \nThe loud noise seemed to halt everyone in their tracks. Then another crash slammed into the door causing splinters and stress fractures to appear in the wood.\n\nI turned to Marco and handed him the paddle before running to the door In an attempt to help brace for the next impact. \n\n\"We have to get the hell out of here, now!\" I said aloud\n\n\"Jeff you get to the window and get out me and John will hold off the door, we're the biggest\" muttered Danny through clenched teeth attempting to keep the door from coming apart. \n\n\"Yea, sure, go fuck yourself dude\" Jeff muttered in disgust at the words the thought of leaving us behind left a bitter taste in his mouth. \n\n\"You don't have time to argue J GET OUT!\" Danny replied.\n\nJeff hesitated for a moment in contemplation before obeying and sliding out of the window in anger.\n\n\"You're next Johnny, get the fuck out of here!\" He continued while turning to face me.\n\n\"You'll never hold this by yourself Dan, It's too much weight\" I spat in return at the idea.\n\n\"C'mon il be right behind you, now go!\" Danny replied to my arguments in an annoyed tone.\n\n\"Shit okay...ready?\" I replied \n\nDanny shook his head in agreement. \n\nTaking a deep breath before counting I said \"one.....two......THREE!\" \n\nallowing my back to leave the failing door I made my sprint for the window. \n\n\"Grrr!\" Echoed through the air as Danny pushed with all his might to hold steady in place against the weight. \n\nAs I reached the windowsill I heard one more shattering crash into the door. The Impact having shoved Danny to the side as a pile of three or more abominations plunged face first into the hardwood. \n\nI desperately attempted and failed to scramble through the small window having found the tail of my shirt wrapped around the shank of a large nail. \n\nThe panic in my veins began to well up as the feeling of dread covered me like a weighted blanket. \n\n\"Shit...shit I'm stuck!\" I shouted out into the humid night. \n\nMarco and Jeff began racing towards the window in an attempt to help. \n\nI peered over my shoulder and noticed one of the dead had pinned Danny in the corner of the room, arms locked like a wrestling match. \n\n\"Dan's in trouble we have to...\" was all I could muster before a large mass slammed into my lower body forcing me through the windowsill and down face first into the rocky flowerbed below. \n\nDanny had managed to free himself from the entanglement and bull rushed into me in an attempt to free me from the obstruction. \n\nHe achieved in doing so, however in a sickening turn of events my legs had heaved upwards and into the window causing the rod to fly from its place and out onto the gravel with me. \n\nThe window slammed shut behind me and my hero of a friend found himself locked in that box of walking demons. \n\nHis thunderous cries and pleas for help were cut short at the muffled sound of tearing clothing and breaking bones. \n\nTo be honest with you I still blame myself. Often times I stare are the lines on my ceiling and see his face in them. They bend and contort into the shape of his horrified expression and for a moment I'd swear his screaming was echoing off the walls in my small apartment."},"80":{"title":"Sisters (Part IV Finale)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kisb3w\/sisters_part_iv_finale\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"HelpTheBagMan","selftext":"[PART I ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kioo0y\/sisters_part_1\/)| [PART II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis8a7\/sisters_part_ii\/) | [PART III](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis9gm\/sisters_part_iii\/) | PART IV\n\nThe larger creature removed his plant from the dish before blowing into it. Once it regained the brightness from our initial trek, the creature placed it within a small opening at the base of it\u2019s neck. It then moved away, guiding us through an unseen opening just beyond the corpse of the thing.\n\nAs we moved from the chamber, in the green glow of the plant I could see now where they had unchained the thing I had just killed. I saw an open space on the floor with rusty, barnacled shackles. My eyes wandered through the space and I saw dozens more of the same sad eyes looking up at me. Silently, they lay prostrate and pleading, chained down with their chests pressed tightly to the floor with arms outstretched before them.\n\nLooking at them I was filled with pity all over again. Their many lonely faces begging for salvation were much like the smaller pale creatures from above. They looked to be in a perpetual state of misery. My eyes swelled with renewed pain as I watched the gaunt figures struggling to breathe, constricted by chains with their too thin legs buried beneath them. It was terrifying to fathom how long they had been suffering there.\n\nJust as I was overwhelmed with the emotion of the sight, I heard a scraping. The thing nearest to me was moving the only thing it could. Slowly, it flexed long spider like claws against the stone. I could see that it had carved out deep grooves from it\u2019s time there. Seeing that it had my attention it spoke to me in a deep wheeze.\n\n\u201cHe-llll-p me ssssss-isssst-er\u2026\u201d\n\nA deep sense of revulsion took me then, and with no care to my captors I broke for the thing. I spat at it with a snarl, ready to hurl myself at it. However, before I could get more than a few feet off course my guard already had me. Carrying me for a few steps, it set me down softly. I gave it no thought at the time and quickly rushed back to Blanches side, taking her hand.\n\nI never looked back down the hallway and I will forever hate those things. I hope they are still chained in the dark.\n\nWe emerged from the underbelly of the cave, where I expected to be instantly assailed again by a throng of creatures. However, there was nothing. The sharp contrast from the city made me feel even more uneasy as we steadily climbed the path out of the passageway in near silence. Reaching the top of the passage I saw what I had barely glimpsed before through the fog.\n\nThe cave opening was even bigger than I had imagined. It was round, and gaped wide. I viewed the great stalactites there above leaking to the stalagmites below, which sunk down and revealed a drop beyond which the path beckoned us to enter.\n\nOur guides seemed changed in this place. They fanned away from us a little more and even walked ahead, seeming to understand that we did not need protection here. It was fully understood that whatever was forward was better than what was behind.\n\nThe gray-green light of the growth passed behind the city. As we walked ever closer to the opening, I reflected. In truth, I believed we had little to no hope of leaving this place. Even if the opening led somewhere else, there was no telling if it would be better. I found myself despairing at what else could be in store for us. More likely than not, these cruel creatures were meant to walk us to our end, not theirs. Among all the lies told, the reality that there was no greater glory to be found here made the truth of the situation that much clearer.\n\nMother Genevieve had lied to me. All the mothers had lied. There was no beauty in descending, or in Him. I realized the likelihood that all the other girls I had known who had descended before me were dead, just like my dear timid Agnes.\n\nWhen I thought of her, my stomach turned. I remembered her fear filled, hopeless face there under the glow staring up at me, eyes wide. Regret swelled and burned within me.\n\nWhat I would give to be able to turn back time. To just have the previous day back with her and Blanche. To say and do the things I should have done all along.\n\nI stopped walking. The guards continued on, increasing their gap from us. I turned to face Blanche and spoke with all the hurt harbored within me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe turned to face me.\n\nThe girl that stared back at me could hardly be the same sister that had awakened and walked with me this morning.\n\nHer eye sat sunken, and the normal look of precious perfect piety had been replaced with a hollow stare that looked more through me than it did at me.\n\nI trembled on weak legs as I took her in. Without my support she swayed as though the caverns wind would surely blow her over.\n\nThe slash marks across her face dove from her left side, concluding in a rough ravine abruptly. Her small torn nose hung limply, swaying under her breath. Blood from her wounds had begun to congeal. The swollen socket of her eye was all but closed, leaking a milky substance from its lid that mixed with the sticky black blood. It froze there like a fungus, dripping from her hair.\n\nThrough her good eye, I did not see that look of determination. Instead, she only looked bewildered. Like a person daydreaming she seemed to wake, not having heard me.\n\n\u201cVilina?\u201d, she questioned.\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, dear sister,\u201d she said in a cloudy, too contented way.\n\nShe tried to smile at me, but as her lips raised over her teeth they caught the edges of the cuts there and she winced.\n\nI broke then. The little part of me that held in all of the hurt, all of the anger, all of the guilt, was shattered. Anger at the mothers for their deception, anger at the creatures for their malice, anger at myself for being so self absorbed. It broke the part of me that stubbornly held on to any bit of hope, and I was lost to despair in that moment. I wept and ranted like a lunatic to the only person I had left to lose, and who I knew in that moment, I surely would lose. I would not let this last moment pass if this was to be our last moment together.\n\n\u201cDo you think Agnes knew I loved her? Do you know how much I care for you? I cant stop seeing her face in that place, as she was, and that thing. All I can think about is how I have never been there for her\u2026 or you. How I would give anything to go back and spend more days with you both. Instead of the all the forests in all the world I would give anything to have just have one more day spent toiling over chores with you and her. To hold her close as you did so many times and comfort her as you did. To be strong and caring as you are. I spent so many days cursing you for your perfection that I did not realize the things I mocked were the things about you I wished only to have within myself\u2026 I am just so sorry Blanche, sorry for everything. For my selfishness and my wanderlust, and for what it cost me.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she whispered, more alert.\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026maybe\u2026\u201d I stuttered, \u201cmaybe if I wasn\u2019t such a fool, so concerned with myself I could have been more concerned with the mothers teachings, more concerned with the thoughts of my sisters, and maybe then you both would know how much I truly adored you. You for your strength, and Agnes for her innocence. That you would both know how precious you are to me,\u201d I continued quickly losing my breathe.\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d, she said flatly.\n\n\u201cWe adore you Valina. You, the perfect cherished child of the village. We all look to you with wide eyed wonder. You are the envy of us all. Your unbridled self assurance and a will to match stone.\u201d\n\nMy eyes went wide.\n\nShe embraced me, and softly she whispered into my ear.\n\n\u201cI love you Valina, and I have spent many nights wishing I was you. Both Agnes and I spoke of it often, and I love you for all the things you say you wish you could have changed. I would change none.\u201d\n\nShe pulled back from me. Holding on to my shoulders, she looked past me as if something of interest were there, but there was nothing. As she was turned away, I only saw the unmarred side of her face. She looked every bit the beauty I always remembered her being. It was only as she spoke that I realized how deeply the madness had taken its toll.\n\n\u201cBut wishing we could change things does not matter now. His will is all that matters, here and always. Whatever happened was His will, just as it will be in the future. There is no use trying to change things.\u201d\n\nShe had forsaken all hope of control, defaulting to the safety of her dogma.\n\nWith that she broke away from me. In the same determined way I had come to prize, she slowly stumbled down the path.\n\nI collected my thoughts about what she had said. How could she possibly still believe there was some grand plan for us after all we had seen? How could she still believe He had any divine plan in store for us? The look of madness on Blanches face was still fresh in my mind, but she was still my beloved sister. So, I carried on down the path after her. As I reached her, I placed my arm around her for support. We walked together twisting through the great teeth of the cave and into its cavernous mouth.\n\nJust inside the cave we found the creatures waiting for us with their green plants lighting the area around them. We folded in with them as they dispassionately led us forward.\n\nIn no time at all we came to a large stone. The monument lifted and raised like a massive thick carpet, stretching like an undulating appendage of the cave floor frozen before us. We approached the end of the statue and the creatures halted there.\n\nImmediately they turned to look at us. The larger creature pointed to Blanche. I pushed her behind me, the thought of losing her flooding into me again. She broke from my clutch, and I tried to stop her.\n\n\u201cPlease no,\u201d I muttered through my heartbreak.\n\n\u201cIt will be alright, Vilina. As He wills, it will be done.\u201d\n\nShe smiled her last smile as her fingers left mine. The creature took her by the wrist. It brought her hand up towards the statue, as it pulled up a small knife.\n\nI gasped, but Blanche\u2019s smile only widened as she willingly opened her hand.\n\nIt moved the knife and I saw the well of blood open within her palm.\n\nQuickly he rotated her wrist, pressing it against the altar. The creature stepped away.\n\nBlanches head flew back, convulsing wildly. Loose flesh flew from her face and flapped with the momentum. It tangled with her wild hair as I heard her body crack, the air within her hissing out as she contorted. As quickly as it had started, it stopped with her face pointing straight up. She inhaled sharply and began heaving raked bouts of air. Her good eye flashed green plant light between hurried flutters. She struggled against the stone but her palm never left the surface as if she was stuck there. Then all at once it released her, the light in her eyes went out and she fell back on the cave floor.\n\n\u201cBlanche!\u201d, I cried out.\n\nAs I ran to her I realized that the second creature flanked me, and in one deft move it pulled me away. I struggled pointlessly as I watched Blanche start to move. She raised her head, both eyes now open wide with frenzied terror.\n\n\u201cVilina! You cant!\u201d, she screamed.\n\nScrambling to her feet, she rushed at me.\n\n\u201cI WAS WRONG! RUN! DONT TOUCH IT! KILL ME!\u201d, she forced out with everything she had.\n\nFrantically, she looked over her shoulder for the other creature, but it was already too late. He was far to fast for her to outrun.\n\nThe larger creature was already on her. Both of its appendages wrapping and constricting her around the waist, it locked her against itself. Its head canted to one side, and from the hole at the center of its face its tongue slithered out. It bore down on her, pressing its face against hers. Its tongue invaded her mouth and filled her cheeks as the smaller tentacles groped her face, entering the wounds there. I heard her cries redouble, muffled within the creatures hollow head.\n\nI moved to attack the creature. Its companion effortlessly stopped me, wrapping my wrists and holding me there. Helpless, I watched as the creature finished its kiss. Releasing the rest of her body, it moved to stalk away. Grabbing her by the arm it dragged her back down the path towards the city. She tried to pull away but it was too powerful. As she threw herself to the ground in an attempt to escape, it merely grabbed her ankle as it drug her away from me. The last time I ever saw my sister in person, she had a look of panic and fear. Her screams continued to echo within the stone walls of the cave as she faded away, a concert of cruelty played just for me.\n\nWhen the creature released me, it did so gently. I had unconsciously been straining so hard against the creature. Now that I was free, I went limp with exhaustion and despair. Staring off into the direction of my sister, now silent and dark, I trembled.\n\nI realized in that moment that these things had nothing else left to take from me other than my life. The thought became clear, He had taken everything from me. The longer I dwelt on that thought, the more my grief turned to rage.\n\nMy sorrows turned to savagery as I turned on the creature. I pivoted quickly to pounce at it. Attack with all the hate and malice laid plain on my heart. When I made my move, I stumbled because it was already next to me, its knife out. I struck at it, but it did not attack me. It gripped my right hand as I pounded away at it with my left, kicking and screaming, scratching at it as though I was a wild beast.\n\nAs the rest of my body was free to fight in futility, the creature pulled my hand close to it and opened my palm. My hand blossomed to expose the barely healed cut there and the creature paused. It slowly turned to look at me, and for the first time I could tell there was no hate behind those oily orbs. I stopped my futile attacks, and it just stared, considering me. It moved closer, and for a moment I thought it meant to do the same to me as the other creature had done to Blanche. However, it stopped mere inches from my face. Its whisker like facial tentacles still beckoning, it looked deep within me and slowly nodded its head. As it\u2019s head descended downward, so too did the knife into my palm. The creature carved a deep line across the existing cut. New blood came, and pooled in my hand. Before a drop could overflow he pressed my hand against the stone.\n\nIf I was awake, I was plunged into sleep. This seemed more like finally waking from the dream as the visions came swimming and swarming over me. The images rushed through my minds eye, flashing before me in seconds. My physical eyes flickered and yet I could see and understand it all perfectly, as He intended.\n\nEverything felt so real as consciousness sprang forth within me. He showed me everything He wanted me to see. He showed me how to feel. He showed me my purpose. He showed me that He was everything I ever needed.\n\nAlthough my sight still remained there in that waking dream, I now saw the truth. The statue I touched was no statue, it was Him. I knew then that I was touching His tongue as he tasted my flesh. He soaked in the contents of my cut, my body, my soul, and measured me in totality at last. I was within him, the Great Old One himself as He slept within the walls of this place. As this was revealed to me, I wept under his eminence while he flooded me with knowledge.\n\nNext I saw the village with its many cabins and homes. The Mothers and girls were running errands and chores under the flowering dogwoods. He showed me every time I had broken the rules of the village and how He had allowed it. These weren\u2019t rules, they were tests inside tests. He had no use for rules, He was the breaker. He had no use for chains because he had complete authority over His domain, over us. Then I was off, rushing over my mountains of majesty. I saw another village filled with many men and boys. They had one Mother, equal to Father, the aged visage of venerability.\n\nGasping, I now saw every inch of the cave, its catacombs and inner workings. Through his vision I passed into one of the burrows within the city. I delved down to the dank pools where the creatures I now knew were His children found comfort within the blackened, feted, grottos they called home. This, the largest cavern was merely the closest to Him, its people most pure. The other caverns, passaged and steeped in the their own glory, all served their own special purposes that detailed His plans, within plans, within plans. Designs that detailed more than I could ever hope to describe here.\n\nHe showed me the purposes of my sisters and made clear their uses and the different paths laid out for the girls. Among the many places he framed, I saw Blanche\u2019s scarred face dwelling in the endless spawning pools beneath. She would be a mother, and her brood would be a bastion of blessings throughout the city, their purpose serving Him as we all did. They would do the work and give themselves willingly. Their blood would feed the true people of this place and provide them the sustenance to grow until His awakening.\n\nWith that, at last he shared with me my purpose. I felt the tears of joy stream down my face as I wept under his veil. I was there wedded to him completely. He fed me my desires and I reveled in his designs of which I could not begin to fathom. I did not need to understand. All I knew, all I needed to know was that He was there, and I was there to serve Him.\n\nFinally, He laid my path out for me. I had my life\u2019s purpose.\n\nAt the height of my ecstasy I began to feel sorrow as He showed me our journey together was about to end. I longed for him to stay. I held onto that fleeting feeling until I felt him leave me.\n\nFor the second time that day I fell, and let the darkness carry me away.\n\nI awoke with the sun rising through the clouds of a wavering tempest passing away from me. The ocean waves lapped at my feet and the shore was cold. I stood to mourn its retreat, but knew His will and understood my place.\n\nFor a long moment, I just sat and watched the seaside serenity before making my way to the nearest town to begin my new life here among you.\n\nI have seen many things since my descendance; cars, planes, cities, computers, and many technological advances in your society. Still, I know that none of these wonders here can compare to Him and His precious presence, for which I still long.\n\nWhy am I here? That would be my first question if I was one of you, never having seen Him. Alas, we cant know the lessons of the world hiding behind Mother\u2019s skirts forever. Plainly, I have come to learn. I have learned to read and write your many languages and have been functioning here among you. I have come to understand the human race away from Him as we all do, once we leave our adolescence behind.\n\nIt has been 100 years to the day since I emerged from that cave and was birthed into your world.\n\nI walked among the deep, dark, and dirty things that dwell within the belly of the earth. In the end I emerged cleaner than when I began, my linens white and washed of the filth and blood of my descendance. Now and forever since that point, I belong to him. An apostle of the Great Elder.\n\nWith this message, my long mission is nearly finished. I shall return home and nest within the valley above the deep. I have but one final chore to complete, to secure my celebrated return home. He has already shown me my path. In His vision I have known everything that would come to pass along my journey, even every word written here. So you see, I already know my daughters face, as well as her name, Katya. I have now only to collect her from her false parents and bring her home to the vale with me. To embrace my Mother once more as sisters, now in perfect covenant with Him.\n\nYou may believe that these testimonies are of some sort of devious cosmic cruelty. They are not.\n\nYou see my time here has afforded me a window into your lives, and I must tell you I can sum up your current state succinctly.\n\nYour cities ebb and flow, oceans of people aimless and without true purpose past selfish pursuits of meaningless toil. Like a rogue wave, one day He will rise. When He does, He will crash through your world and in His cleansing tide remake it as His, as it should be.\n\nWith this truth you can continue on in this way, or you can choose to serve a greater role in Him. I do not need to tell you where to find Him. Simply open your mind and He will find you. Your dreams will be waking, and He will show you all you need to see. He will embrace you. Although you may never come to know me, and I may never know the fruits of my labors here, you will come to know Him. Through Him you will know your true purpose as a bleeder, a breeder, or a true believer."},"81":{"title":"Sisters (Part III)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis9gm\/sisters_part_iii\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"HelpTheBagMan","selftext":"[PART I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kioo0y\/sisters_part_1\/)\u00a0|\u00a0 [PART II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis8a7\/sisters_part_ii\/) | PART III | [PART IV](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kisb3w\/sisters_part_iv_finale\/)\n\nMy hearing returned before my sight, the dripping sounds of water pattering on stone from far above. I felt cold within my soaking linens as they clung to me, but far more uncomfortable was the uneven rock beneath me.\n\nBecoming more conscious, I opened my eyes as if I had never opened them at all. In my haze, I remembered slowly what had happened. However, once I realized, the panic set in. It hit with a fury at having been so overlooked. Senses heightened, I heard my breathing catch and hasten. Where was I?\n\nI would have called out then, if not for the feeling of fear within me. The fear that screamed silently that there was more to be afraid of here. What may be waiting for me here in the dark? There is a comfort in isolation rather than an unknown friend.\n\nSitting up quickly in the darkness, I felt the many rocks scrape and tear at my dress. Moving to my knees I felt about, cautiously surveying the area around me with my hands.\n\nMy wrist sunk into a puddle, plunging me down. I stumbled hard onto my shoulder and face. Uncontrollably, I groaned at the pain.\n\nI heard something move in response.\n\nLaying completely still, I did my best to control my breathing through the pain.\n\nI listened to its shuffling and heavy breathing.\n\nWhatever it was, it was coming closer.\n\nI braced myself to move, but in the blackness here, I had nowhere to run.\n\nIn my deprivation, I could feel the blank air around me palpitating to the rhythm of my own heartbeats.\n\nWhatever I had heard, it was searching around right next to me, touching the deep puddle I had fallen into.\n\nI screamed as I felt something grab my ankle and kicked away from it. It crashed into the water as I stood to run. I recognized the equally horrified scream, piercing as it came echoing back off the cave walls.\n\n\u201cBlanche?\u201d, I called out.\n\nIt was her turn to groan as she crawled out of the water-filled fissure.\n\n\u201cVilina? Is that you? Is Agnes with you?\u201d\n\nFollowing her voice, I knelt to find her hand and held it. I felt instant comfort in her warmth.\n\n\u201cNo, I went last. She was after you. She isn't with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I am sure she is down here somewhere, but I can\u2019t see a thing.\u201d\n\nThe frustration overtook me then.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018other world\u2019 of yours needs a candle.\u201d I said, with all the condescension I could muster.\n\n\u201cI am sure we will find our way if it is His will,\u201d she said coldly.\n\nI scoffed.\n\n\u201cFather just tried to kill us!\u201d, I yelled.\n\nAs I did, I heard the the exclamation traveling away from me and not just echoing back. Something within the chamber had changed. As I registered this fact, I saw for the first time in this place. A small green glow began lighting a tunnel behind us. I heard crunching footfalls as the light grew steadily brighter until I was fully able to see what carried it.\n\nWhat entered the room were not mothers, girls, or even men. The two creatures looked as tall as father, but their flesh was black as pitch. Their shape was only made out by the florescent glow given off by something behind them that scattered a pale-green, mottled color. Large menacing shoulders of hardened chitin gave way to claws with too few or too many digits to be call hands in any sense. Where there should have been a face, a nose, a mouth, there was only a cavity lined with bristled tendrils that slowly swayed and wafted like fingers that beckoned. Beyond the facial appendages sat many rows of small, jagged teeth. On the sides of the head were unnaturally wide and bulbous eyes. They glared at us. Those greasy, black-brown orbs conveyed more hate and contempt than anything even Mother Beatrice could muster.\n\nI howled a high pitch screech at seeing them.\n\nThey never stopped moving as they entered the small chamber. As they moved, the creatures breathed a heavy hissing sound. They clicked and chirped, like the sounds of overlapping insects in the night. As they closed on us we backed away from them. We reached and pressed ourselves against the far wall of the cave. They moved around us and pushed us roughly forward towards the tunnel where they had entered.\n\nI tried to say something to Blanche, but as soon as did they struck me. Their strong shoves and blows to the back of our heads every time we tried to speak made it known that this was unacceptable. As we left the chamber, I noticed the puddle Blanche and I had both slipped from earlier. It was a basin, worn from water which dripped tirelessly from an unknown source above. Out of the darkness there the water fell like teardrops from the bygone innocence of my childhood left behind in that place.\n\nFrom that small collecting pool sprang a steady stream which was our constant companion as we wound deeper and deeper within the belly of the earth, always downward. At times we quickly descended, sliding on our sides or rears down water-slicked passages or traversing impeding rocks that the creatures navigated with apparent ease.\n\nThe creature\u2019s light was bright within the darkness, however, not so great as to allow flight from them beyond a few feet. Compelled as we were to descend into the depths, there was little room for error between the creatures and upcoming obstacles of the tunnel. We walked to the point in which the casualness of the journey became a monotony. Complacent in our steady pace having not faced any obstacle in our way for quite some time, it was then that I walked forward and felt my foot carry on past where it should have met stone. I felt my stomachs equilibrium turn on end as I found my momentum carrying me not just forward but also down, off the cliffs edge which I had so carelessly missed.\n\nI screamed out, but before I could get more than a squeak passed my teeth the larger creature had me around the waist and was pulling me back up to the ledge. Lucky as I felt to have been saved, I was quickly brought back to the reality of the situation as the creature flung me into the cave wall. I fell there next to my sister and looked back up at the creature. Clicking and waving its grotesque claw about over the chasm, I was thoroughly chastised. Its anger seemed to intensify as I laid there, and it moved forward as if to do me more harm. Blanche was there to quickly pull me to my feet. I leaned on her as she carried me down the path.\n\nAs we moved away, I ventured a look over the cliffs edge, more out of wonder than of any hope of seeing what fate what may have befallen me there. By chance, or by some working of the same nightmare that made the rest of this possible, I glimpsed something there in the deep. A shape - large, shifting, and glistening within its own wetness - was moving within the void. I shuddered.\n\nWe hugged the wall as it narrowed, moving one at a time now, paying careful attention to our every footfall. What felt like eons passed there in the dark. The silence was only broken by ours and our shepherds\u2019 steps as they echoed from cavern to cavern. We traveled down and down. Our only reprieve from this tedium of silence was the sound of things scratching or breathing as they wandered around down there in the blackness, out of sight. I was glad to never know them or their purpose, but it kept us all the more vigilant.\n\nI thought we were meant to walk until we gave out, but after an interminable time, I began to see something else in the darkness before us. Something that started off small at first. I was sure it was another of the creatures with its green glow emanating from its back. As we drew nearer, I saw that I could not have been more wrong. This was not one of the creatures for it was far too large.\n\nWe approached a crag in the cave wall ahead. Through it I could see the glow of the same green colored light, but of a blinding intensity in comparison. I tasted hope and thought beyond any real sense that it may even be daylight through the leaves of my forest. Like the hopes of a hungry man for a sweet apple, I bit in. I was greeted only with decay. A hot wind carrying a pungent, sweet necrotic odor crashed through me. Blanche and I both stumbled. Queasy, I fought back the urge to vomit.\n\nThrough the gagging, they hit us again and again until we moved forward. They pushed us through the opening and we fell on our knees to the sights and sounds of that foul place. Gazing up, I took in a cave more massive than anything I had ever seen in my life. I could see the path we had been on was still laid before us, the stream continuing now directly into the heart of this place. I followed it with my eyes and saw that it led directly into a vast city.\n\nBarking at us, our captors forced us to stand and pushed us down the trail into the city of chartreuse chaos and the clamoring cacophony of cruelty within. I tried to study the metropolis, yet over everything throughout the cave hung a mirage-like mist that obscured all things. A mist that wafted and swayed with an unseen wind. Through it I could barely make out the rough shapes of buildings that seemed to move and morph in the most sickening ways, reminding me of the object on Fathers nightstand. Looking at the structures my breath caught, and the putrid heat assailed me again. Retching, I pulled away. This time the vomit came, and there was no stopping it.\n\nWiping the bile from my lips, I tried to take in the city once more with my stomach empty. Although disgusted, I was still amazed at the sight of the place. Across the whole visible horizon, the city spread with its massive spired structures and carved burrows. Scanning, I took in the sheer size of the dome-like opening that ceilinged the city. The light that lit the cavern was emitted from the wall on one side. It pulsed and flickered as if made from many things. They culminated in one large organism; a massive, glowing, living thing. The growth branched off, spreading up towards the ceiling. It dangled there like unkempt hair. On the opposite side of the glowing growth stood a large cave mouth shrouded in shadow. I could barely see it through the waves of shimmering fog that swirled like a silent ocean.\n\nAs we reached the edge of the city, I could see the shapes of other things moving around in the fog. Still unable to really look at the buildings without feeling dizzy, I kept my eyes down except for small glimpses around to navigate. What I saw made me wish I had not.\n\nThe whole city was carved from within or built from the stone of the cave. Its many murky mired pools and fissures seemed to do little to inhibit the cities inhabitants. Past the first set of edifices, we began drawing more creatures than just our guards. They watched us with revulsion as we passed. Hundreds, if not thousands of wet fixed stares bored into us. As we trekked further, the inhabitants seemed less content with just glaring, desiring to voice their rage as they lathered us in their loathing. They hissed and clicked, spitting and roaring at us. Shaking, we held each other as we walked. Their children ran free throughout the city and much like their parents they seemed predisposed to oblige us with their hate. They were encouraged to throw rocks or refuse at us as we moved. Occasionally the dwellers would be emboldened. Delighting in our fright, they would go on all fours with a running start to come right up to us and spit in our faces. In one such moment, I thought certainly one meant to do more than just jeer or spit as he raised an arm to strike at us. Our guide clicked quickly, a small chirp that froze the thing in place. It snorted and slinked back. Our caretakers then took position in front of us and moved forward through the growing crowd as it moved around us.\n\nWe moved along the pathway, trailed by the audience who now kept their distance, but only as much as they could while more creatures pressed in to gawk at our spectacled passing. Going further within the city I noticed something had changed and the creatures I saw were not all as they had been. Before there had been the creatures like the ones that had come to retrieve us from the cave after the well. On entering the city, I noticed slight differences. Thinner creatures with the same color, only more delicate looking, with their slender builds and softer features. However, dwelling deeper there were also other things within this place. Small crustacean-like creatures that skittered, hiding between crack and crevasse as we passed, avoiding the mob. Longer bodied and many-legged vicious looking things also stared at us laying coiled at the feet of their master\u2019s or while traversing the sides of the buildings.\n\nMost curious of all were the bottom feeders. They looked like the main citizens of the city, however they could never be confused with the monsters. They were small, human sized things with speckled flabby flesh and had no hardened appearance to them at all. They trudged through the side streets and off shoots between burrows. When I saw the larger creatures come in contact with these vaguely humanoid beings, they treated them with the same level of disdain as they had for us, only with much less regard.\n\nI watched as one of these bottom feeder creatures attempted to scrape away excess build-up from the growth that covered the sides of the spires here. I still could not see what made up the growth, but it seemed to be truly attached as the base-born thing clawed away at the green mass. Its digits bending under the force, sweat ran profusely in the heat, dripping down the malnourished skin pulled tight against its ribs. As it strained, it exposed cuts from what I could only imagine were the latest in a lifetime of abuses.\n\nAs we moved, I saw there was a group of the larger creatures at the head of the alleyway. Tracing the direction of my gaze, they realized what I saw there and moved in on the poor thing as it worked, unsuspectingly. Without preamble they reared back and whipped the thing with their hardened, tentacled hands. Like oiled lightning, I saw them flick and smack at the poor wretch. I heard it scream out in agony before it was left beaten and bloody on the cave floor, unmoving. Turning back towards me, their faces were flecked with its red blood, thin tentacles wiping themselves clean as they clacked raucously.\n\nI turned to see if Blanche had witnessed what had happened in the alley. However, she had been witnessing her own atrocities. Looking on past her, here in the heart of the city I beheld a great central pit. Within it were what I believed to be the bodies of more of the smaller creatures. The pathway skirted the edge of the basin before continuing. As we made our closest circuit we could plainly see the headless mass of a small pale creature on a flat, angled, stone alter. The body was flayed completely exposing the musculature, organs, and bone. Hung upside down, its blood dripped from the slab and into a communal pool beneath. Around the pool, still more of the pitiful smaller creatures dipped vessels into the lake and carried them away to unknown destinations. The harsh, sickly-sweet aroma of long decay mingled with the ironed ozone smell of fresh viscera. I knew then that this is what I smelled even before entering the cave.\n\nThe magnitude of the slaughter and the grotesque nature of the exhibition filled me with endless sorrow. I found myself hanging my own head low, trudging much as these scavengers did. Onward, I followed the command of my captors.\n\nThe creatures ushered us forward past the crowds of grotesque amphibious denizens. Parting, the crowd revealed a pathway cut in the stone. It dove once again, now under the city.\n\nI could feel the rough debris long since abandoned from this passage\u2019s creation below my feet with every step. Despite being accustomed to traveling the walkways of the village and woods barefoot, one way or another this path made clear that I was not meant to be a part of this world as the jagged pieces of earth pierced my soles.\n\nI tripped, stumbling as a large splinter of rock cut deep in the padding of my foot. Instinctively I dropped to pick it out, offering my knees as sacrifice to the pain.\n\nOur guides clicked and growled at this. Their scale clad feet crushed and crunched the stones as they turned and marched menacingly back towards us.\n\nBefore they could reach us, Blanche pulled me up and whispered, \u201cBe strong. Don\u2019t let them see your pain.\u201d\n\nThe tears held back from the whole experience hit me as I saw them coming, felt the pain. I missed my mother, the dogwood petals, forests, and mountains. I missed Agnes. Seeing her timid and shy face often made me feel superior. I was strengthened in her frailty. Without her, I felt the burden of that weakness.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said, more sternly than ever before.\n\nShe shook me.\n\nThe creatures callously moved into us. They struck Blanche in the back of her legs. Jolted from the impact, she grimaced in pain. She trembled, but she did not fall.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said again before marching on. Leading by example, her stride never faltered. She seemed unphased by these obstacles, though when I looked to my feet I saw that there were two clear paths of blood trailing behind our every step. My admiration for her stoicism resolved me once again to push forward. I hardened my eyes and stepped down the path towards the opening below.\n\nThe crowd of creatures gathered at the lip of the tunnel, chittering and dripping over us as we walked down under the throng. At the end of the walkway stood an archway of stone with a carving of a human face at its peak. Its hollow stare was pulled at the corners of its eyes by a wide-open mouth, screaming in eternal agony.\n\nWe walked into the abyss; I could see nothing but shadow residing within. The jeering hiss of the creatures vanished as we dove lower into the passage. We listened to the crunch of the creature\u2019s feet before us, doing our best to follow. They either knew where they were going, or they could easily see in this place while we were completely blind. Our guides footsteps stopped ahead. Blanche and I clung to each other as we froze in place there in the darkness.\n\nSightless, my other senses peaked. I could hear every little sound; the drip and drop of water on water coming down somewhere in the chamber; our fear filled breathing; the low rattling sounds that resonated from within the creatures chests, and wet flapping sounds as they exhaled.\n\nI heard the crunching again, except now it moved towards us. I heard it shifting about mere inches from me. I braced in fear, thinking of what it would do and how I would not be able to see it coming.\n\nI jumped as a small patch of the gray-green light blossomed before my face. Raising his tentacled hand I saw it then. The monster breathed into a piece of the growth; I saw now that it was a sticky-wet green plant. It would have been magical in any other circumstance. However, here I found it horrifying as it illuminated the details of the larger creature\u2019s face. Limelight glowed in the iridescence of the oily black eyes of the thing. It\u2019s breath rolled out like a fog from the cavity at the center of its face, smelling of decomposing flesh and fish oil.\n\nI looked around for the other creature, but the plant was small and only offered illumination of the creature\u2019s face. There was still pitch black beyond. The light only showed that the tunnel had never widened, and only reached an arms length around us going forward toward the creatures.\n\nI did not know what to expect. We trembled as it looked at us. Despite the malice laid plain in its gaze there was also a glee that took pleasure in our torment, as it let out a low, chittering snicker.\n\nThe sound echoed and faded. Somewhere in the abyss I heard the second creature. Shifting and heaving, it racked chains against chains before I heard them slap against the stone floor.\n\nThe creature in front of me snorted. Spraying globules of sticky oiled mucus across our faces. We recoiled, and when I looked back, he was gone. Standing now 10 feet away, he raised the plant and blew into it once again, making it slightly brighter. He raised it to the caverns ceiling exposing a small metal tray that hung there as he placed the glowing plant within. Standing below the light, as he basked in its glow he chittered once more. When he stepped backward, he appeared to slide into the darkness. As he moved, he revealed his gift for us. Bathed in the green glow where his shadow had been, sat Agnes\u2019 head.\n\nHer head sat lopsided, with a few of her vertebrae holding it at an angle. Her hair was still wet from the well, eyes pulled open wide. As hard as I try now, I can never picture my sister\u2019s face in any other way. That frozen look of terror that she must have died with is painted on her face for eternity in my mind.\n\nBlanche screamed, in a flood of anguish. I felt her pain, but in that moment I clamped my hand down over her mouth. Her muffled misery bled through my fingers. I gasped, noticing the small knicks and nibbles missing from Agnes\u2019 cheeks. My own torment shrieked from within and leaked from my eyes. I hurt as she hurt, but I also knew that this sight could not be the sole reason for this chamber. This was not the end, not what they had in store for us. My sisters head did not require chains.\n\nAs if summoned by my thought, the next trial slowly trudged into focus, framed in the glow and hanging over Agnes.\n\nThe thing before us was not like the other creatures, the ones who had led us here or any we had seen throughout the city. It was smaller. Like an emaciated child it leaned and canted as if it were unsure of its own balance at any moment. Its carapace skin looked rough and hard. There were small bumps and ridges at the outer edges of its shape, while it still maintained a soft pink and milky white flesh to its torso. Its arms hung like twigs at its side, with hands hidden in shadow below its oddly distending belly. Atop its shoulders sat a deteriorated human head. The skin fell from yellowed bone at the cheeks and its jaw looked broken as it hung limply from one side. Its eyes were sunken within its skull, and despite the grotesque form they inhabited it emanated a profound sadness. The eyes communicated a story of immeasurable suffering as they stared into mine.\n\nBlanche knelt beside me, still weeping. I felt as she did for my sister but I could not drag my eyes from this pitiful thing.\n\nAs it sat with its eyes locked to mine in that pleading way, I heard the sound of our guards behind it. They bellowed out a series of ravenous clicks and gruff growls.\n\nThe thing winced, breaking from my gaze. Slowly lowering itself to the ground, it hovered over Anges\u2019 jilted head. It looked back up to me and Blanche as it began to move its mouth over her face, consuming the flesh and bone with sickening slurping and crunching sounds. It never blinked, and it never took pleasure in its work as it stared up at us.\n\nBlanche screamed again and buried her face in her arms, renewing her cries.\n\nAs it finished consuming my sisters remains it stood straighter with sustenance. Under the sickly green glow the thing\u2019s face began to change, contorting and snapping into place with a series of twitches. As unseen structures shifted, I realized I looked into my own sisters face. Although the eyes never changed, I found that they had always been my sisters eyes. Sad, dejected, and afraid, the thing\u2019s mournful gaze never shifted from my eyes.\n\nWithout thinking, I took a step forward but stopped when I saw that it took a step towards us. Timidly, I stepped forward again. It mimicked my motion.\n\nI stopped and looked back to Blanche hoping for some sort of conference. She still lay there, broken and mourning.\n\nWhen I turned to look back at the thing it had silently moved closer.\n\nI stiffened but did not move. For a long while we both stood staring at each other, its eyes begging me for something I could not know.\n\nFinally I spoke. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\n\nMy question seemed to cause it pain. It winced again like it had from the guards. A tear fell from its eye and it trembled.\n\nI spoke again, gentle and low. \u201cWhat do I need to do to get through?\u201d\n\nIts eyes shifted down looking at the floor, before coming back to meet me.\n\nIt spoke with broken gurgling inhuman words, as if its mouth was never meant to speak. The words came bubbling like stuttering and stumbling through thick vomit.\n\n\u201cH-hell\u2026\u201d\n\nIt choked and gulped back the words, taking another step forward.\n\nIt was now an arms length from me and had stepped out from the light of the plant.\n\nIts head tilted back up.\n\n\u201cHe-llll-p me ssssss-isssst-er\u2026\u201d it hissed in a mournful plea.\n\nAs I looked into its pleading eyes, misty with hurt, I found my hand raising instinctively.\n\nIt came up towards the thing\u2019s face, my sisters face. The child like, sad, lonely, and fear filled expression I had always known. The sister forgotten, the sister cast aside, so afraid of her own shadow. The sister I had neglected and now outlived. More than anything, I wanted the chance apologize for never giving her the same care and attention that she had from Blanche all along. A chance to right the wrongs of my own selfish and stubborn ways.\n\nI brought my hand up to the level of Agnes\u2019 face.\n\nAs I did, it\u2019s arm raised revealing long claws. It\u2019s sharp, lethal fingers climbed up out of the darkness, suspended over my head. It moved up much faster than I had moved. As I went to recoil, it moved even faster. Swinging its claw towards my chest, it aimed to slash right through me.\n\nIn that moment Blanche flashed between us, pushing me back. I fell hard against the stone. Closing the distance faster than the thing expected she offset the distance between its claw and its target. I could only witness as the thing\u2019s claw came sweeping down over Blanche\u2019s head, swatting her to the ground. She laid motionless on the stone.\n\nI screamed as Blanche had first screamed. The feelings of regret, Agnes\u2019 death, the betrayal of our Mothers, and now my remaining sister broken in front of me tore through my mind. All the helplessness of the situation overcame me and I roared into action.\n\nThe apologetic mournful eyes of the thing meant nothing to me as I crashed into it. The thing hit the ground hard beneath me, and I was already ripping and tearing at it. I sunk my fingers into the soft flesh unguarded by shell. Pulling and snapping, I grabbed at its arm releasing a splintering sound. I was vaguely aware of the fluids as I continued my assault. Crippled now and laying on its other arm with me on top of it, it stared up at me, pleading out scrambled syllables. I stuck my thumbs deep into those eyes - my sisters eyes - forever snuffing out that desperation. I felt its life dwindle as it stopped writhing beneath me.\n\nI sat atop the thing breathing heavily, and began to sob. I frantically wiped the tears, and turned to see Blanche weakly pulling herself to her knees. I went to help her up, only now noticing the red blood that covered my hands, arms, and linens. As I raised her up to embrace her, I saw the long gashed trail left by the thing\u2019s claw. Tears flowed once more as I looked over the wound that now marred my perfect sister\u2019s perfect face.\n\nThe creatures reclaimed us apathetically, pushing us on through the tunnel."},"82":{"title":"Sisters (Part II)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis8a7\/sisters_part_ii\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"HelpTheBagMan","selftext":"[PART I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kioo0y\/sisters_part_1\/) |  PART II | [PART III](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kis9gm\/sisters_part_iii\/) | [PART IV](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kisb3w\/sisters_part_iv_finale\/)\n\nI woke the morning of our descendance. There was a quiet that seemed to be swelling in the village. Like an unseen wave about to break I felt myself bracing as I rose from bed, and walked into the common room where my sisters already waited for me. They were holding hands looking towards the open doorway leading out of the house. Both turned to look at me and smiled. Today was our day. Blanche reached out her hand, and despite the previous day, when I reached out to clasp her she quickly closed the distance. Leaning forward, she smiled wide.\n\n\u201cI know we don\u2019t always see eye to eye, but I want you both to know that no matter what happens, I am proud to be your sister. To descend with you. I love you both, with all my heart, and I know He will too,\u201d Blanche said, as tears welled up at the corners of her eyes.\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d said Agnes. She was of course already crying. Whether from anticipation of the unknown, or the speech, I will never know.\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d My voice wavered. Which genuinely shocked me. Somehow I had just never seen today as real. Now that it was here, the feelings of it seemed too big for my comprehension. I swallowed, feeling like I couldn\u2019t speak. So I didn\u2019t.\n\nThen I cried. \u201cI love you\u201d was just something you said to family. Despite having said it many times before, they were just words. Here and now with weight of destiny calling, I was eviscerated with emotions I could not contend with in that moment. Happy tears flowed as Blanche and Agnes pulled me in and hugged me. I realized then that I loved them both dearly. I had always seen Blanche as a golden haired golden child, the apple of any mother\u2019s eye. I saw Agnes as a timid shadow, frightened to step away from her Mothers side.\n\nIf I could go back and change or do anything different that day, I would have told them both that I sincerely loved them. It was a chance I would never get back.\n\nInstead I just held them there, and by the time I was ready to speak I heard it. The call began.\n\nWithin the village the call was almost a roar. The humming chant emanated from the chapel in all directions. Low and bellowing, it felt as though it might knock you backwards. The glass of the windows shook and chattered. It made my eyes flicker on the verge of fainting. My knees buckled, and I gripped Blanche for support. Her smile only grew.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said, as she took a step forward, flanked on either side by Agnes and I. Hand in hand we moved as one.\n\nJust as every other trio of sisters before us had gone. Just as He willed it.\n\nWe walked through the front door and turned onto the main pathway through the village. When we did, I saw them. All the other girls in their windows and doorways. Silently they loomed. Every step we took we were traced by hundreds of wide eyes. Wet with wonder at our every step, they watched in anticipation. I knew because hundreds of times before, I had been them.\n\nWe slowly made our way down the path, met every few steps with another note of the call. I always thought since it was so loud at home, getting closer it would be deafening. However, through some miracle the closer we got to those chapel steps the melody seemed sharper, more defined. The song was calm and quieter. It became more than bearable. I had always loved the call. It was a lull that reverberated from my bones down through the core of me. It was my dream\u2019s song and muse. Now in this moment, I can say it was nothing short of intoxicating.\n\nI felt ready to fall into its warm embrace and never come out. I happily made the steps up the stairs. Barely cognizant of my movements, my bare feet slid over the wood. They raised and fell one after another. One moment I was in the street, and the next I was at the doors of the one building in the village I was never allowed to be near. It was the one rule even I strictly followed.\n\nI could feel my sisters still next to me, Blanche\u2019s hand still in mine. They were both completely silent. There were no tears, laughter, or joy. We all sat staring at the doors. On the next pulse of the call the doors cracked open slowly revealing a blinding light from within. I pulled my free hand up to guard my eyes. When I lowered it, my eyes adjusted as much as they could. I saw now that the rising sun was pouring in like a dam let loose through the valley of pews. Past a large statue at the far end of the room it flowed over every mother in the village.\n\nI thought it was unnerving to have the other girls watching, but it was nothing compared to the anxiety I now felt. Despite His call still growing ever louder in my head and in my heart, I felt small under the scrutiny of the mothers. Their long drawn faces with their many wrinkles and pure white hair sat framing hooded eyes. They judged our every movement. Silently they tracked us as we continued forward. No one within the chapel spoke or gave us direction. Something inside my head just kept saying the same thing in a voice unlike any I had ever heard before. \u201cGo forth. Come to me,\u201d it said.\n\nStep by step we continued to move in unison. We crossed the threshold of the forbidden chapel and passed the pews as we approached the statue. A statue that even today I have trouble explaining. Just like my dreams, it filled me with feelings. As my feelings changed, so did it. At one moment I was giddy, a chalice filled to the cusp with joy. The statue was of a woman, but then it changed. In the changing I was content and at peace, so much that I could have laid down and just stared at it until I let the world waste away. I would have been fine with that. In my desire for it, it now seemed to become darker somehow. Scaled, foreign, and strange, but in no way repellent. It just was, and I was raptured that it was there at all.\n\nI wish I could have pulled my eyes from it to see the mothers. Were they looking at the statue with us? Or were they taking in the triumph of seeing us as we saw with open eyes for the first time?\n\nAt that moment I was far to busy pulling in deep breathes of the every moment spent in its presence.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long we sat gazing into the statue. It could have been seconds, or maybe hours. Time did not seem to matter. All I know is that when the call stopped, the statue was still there. Now it was a simple obelisk with no adornments, standing smaller than even Agnes.\n\nThis feeling was jarring. The world came crashing down around me. I felt like a child who was trying to run after spinning in circles with my eyes closed.\n\nPulled from the dream, I fought to stay awake through the spinning. I could feel my sisters fighting the same urge as we swayed, held up only by our combined will to remain strong in the face of such judgment. I remember thinking, \u201cIs this the weighing and judgment of our souls? A test of strength to persist under such incomprehensible pressure?\u201d. If only it had been.\n\nI looked to my sisters as I felt my legs start to stabilize. Blanche was somehow still smiling through a stupefied look of drunkenness. Agnes stared at the floor though barely staying vertical by the good graces of Blanche\u2019s shoulder. If not for my weight to keep the balance between us, we surely would have toppled.\n\nDespite the call being gone now, I still heard the voice in my head repeating as before.\n\n\u201cGo forth. Come to me.\u201d\n\nI rolled the words around in my head. I could tell my sisters had heard it too. Even Agnes looked up towards the obelisk once more, and when she did I saw her eyes turn to panic.\n\nI quickly looked back toward the statue, to see what I now know to be a man. The very first man I had ever seen. Father.\n\nThe man stepped out from behind the obelisk. His white robes were offset by the true white of his hair. Just as in my dreams, he had hair upon his face. His skin told a story, time cut and weathered like a canyon carved by many inlets or rivers. His age was untold. I remember often thinking about how old the mothers around the village were. When I asked Mother when I would look as they did, her response was \u201cdecades\u201d. Tens of years until I would ever get my first wrinkle or gray hair.\n\nBut if the mothers were old, then this thing in front of me was beyond my comprehension of time. He walked slowly, the apparent frailty of his age showing in the timid steps he took as he crossed the distance between us and the statue.\n\nHe was tall. Taller than all three of us, even Blanche who stood half a head taller than I. Taller than our mothers who always felt like monoliths throughout our upbringing.\n\nI gazed up at him in awe. He stood silently scanning us, and when his eyes met mine, I remember questioning my own sight. For all his aged appearance, his eyes seemed to have been stolen from a much younger man.\n\nLightly colored greenish-blue eyes peered back at me. Spry, happy, and intelligent eyes. Not just wise like a mothers eyes, but calculating. He was watching us, but also measuring. I was sure of it.\n\nThe whole chapel hung still in that silence. The only thing I heard was the breathing of my sisters and I. I wanted to turn and look for Mother Genevieve. However, right as I made my head look away from him, he dragged me back with his breathy flat tone that resonated all throughout the chapel.\n\n\u201cYou have been at your mother\u2019s sides for long enough. You have been brought to adulthood in solitude, safety, and purity.\u201d\n\nI felt Blanche shift uncomfortably next to me.\n\n\u201cMuch like every mother you see standing around you now, you were girls and now you are women.\u201d\n\nHe brought his hands in and touched his chest with the long nails of his fingers.\n\n\u201cI am Father. I am the only man in the village.\u201d\n\nHe paused, reopening his arms and spreading them wide with his palms down.\n\n\u201cIt is my honor to be the keeper of the faith and call this chapel my home. Should you have faith in Him, so too should you have faith in me as the keeper of His calling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a village of all female inhabitants this may seem strange, but I promise all will be explained. You will have all your questions answered through your promised descent.\u201d\n\nHis eyes became softer. He held up his right hand, long fingers made longer still by splintered, discolored nails that grew out unnaturally, raised high for all to see. He held the motion before slowly bringing his pinky and thumb nails to meet in front of his palm. His other three fingers remained above the now perfect circle.\n\n\u201cYou three have come to descend. To travel.\u201d\n\nHe brought the three fingers down and through the bony circle; gripping the three tightly, he made a fist which shook at the force.\n\n\u201cTo visit the other world, to see what we have all seen. In the end, to be weighed and judged. To find where your place among us lies going forward.\u201d\n\nHe stepped towards us and put his long-spindled fingers on both my shoulder and Agnes\u2019. I flinched, but it did not seem to put him off. He leaned in close, looking directly into my eyes and tilting his head back and forth. His facial hair scratched at the front of my dress. He inspected my face, and I tried my best not to move, even though under my skin my heart pounded. I felt as though all the worms of the marsh had found home within my flesh. As if noticing my unease, he lightly patted my back, his long nails sliding up and down the blade of my shoulder and occasionally catching against my linens. My skin turned to gooseflesh and prickled. I felt cold. Despite considerable effort, I began to shudder. Staring back into his eyes, it felt as though his breath was a winter wind sheer. His stare was a tunnel I dared not enter or turn from. I sat frozen in place, just another obelisk spectacle for all.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name child?\u201d, he commanded kindly.\n\n\u201cVilina.\u201d\n\n\u201cVil-Ee-Nuh,\u201d he enunciated. Rolling the letters around his mouth, he flicked his tongue against his teeth as if tasting every letter.\n\nHe smiled, lips pulling back to ribbons, exposing the yellowed husks of what were once human teeth. The smile pulled at the corners of his eyes. What could have been joy could have also been cunning, as he whispered through a grin in a low rasp.\n\n\u201cYou will do nicely. Your mother should be proud. You will be the last to join me below.\u201d\n\nHe then shifted quickly on to Blanche. Removing his hand from my shoulder, he moved to touch her. Had I not been so unsettled, I would have taken great joy in the fact that even she jumped and began to shake under his inquisition.\n\nWhile he looked over my sisters, I had time to gather myself. Quickly I realized that I did have something to be happy about in the end. He had never checked my hands. Never seen the many scars or history of scrapes. He was pleased. Mother had always told me that all we ever needed to do was please Him. So surely, I should have been pleased. Somehow, even without any logical reason to feel otherwise, I was anything but pleased. I looked on, transfixed at the statue over Fathers shoulder. It did not move as before, but I remember wishing it would. Anything to rid me of this feeling of dread.\n\nI continued staring unfocused at the statue, facing forward as he carefully caressed and studied each of their faces, investigating their every feature.\n\nAs time went on, I found myself staring past the statue, to the door against the far wall. I wondered to myself what lay beyond. I saw that it was cracked open, ever so slightly.\n\nThere was something within the chamber. A small bed laid plain with white sheets made up neatly and a night stand next to it. Something on the nightstand caught my eye. Shifting my weight I leaned to one side.\n\nThe change gave me just enough perspective to see an object there roughly the size of a head of lettuce. I say roughly because the objects shape was difficult to describe. It seemed iridescent, dark, and yet indistinct. When I squinted to make out what this amorphous thing was, I felt my eyes unfocus until my head hurt, and I was made to look away at the floor.\n\nCarefully, Father inspected my sisters for a great while before lifting his palms from the sides of Agnes\u2019 face and tore his eyes from hers.\n\n\u201cWell done girls. Well done,\u201d he said, smiling magnanimously.\n\nHe raised his head to orate to the congregation once more.\n\n\u201cI am pleased. You mothers have made Him proud this day!\u201d, he said as he scanned and nodded specifically to our mothers somewhere in the room. Presumably still looking at our mothers, he continued.\n\n\u201cYou have done all you can and fulfilled your promises. Now they go to make promises of their own.\u201d\n\nStill no one else spoke or even murmured. In my peripheral, I could see the shapes of the other mother\u2019s heads as they slowly nodded their assent.\n\n\u201cBlanche, you shall be the first of your sisters to descend. Your value and piety is well known to me, as well as your eagerness to serve His will. He restlessly awaits you. Let us not keep Him waiting.\u201d\n\nI saw her stand taller with pride. Elated, she grinned.\n\nHe held out his hand to her and she accepted. Overjoyed, she stepped up next to Father, and lightly moved as he did in his infirmity. As she neared the statue, I saw her look back one last time in the direction of the mothers. Blanche was happier than I had ever seen her. In that moment, as the sun came through the far window and silhouetted her in a glorious golden glow, I saw her as her mother must have seen her always. She was beautiful and perfect. Not in the backhanded sense I had always thought of her before, but truly ideal. I wished then, and not for the last time, that I could be so ideal.\n\nDespite my envy of her value, we did not share the same dreams. I had never longed for this building, or for the descent as she did. However, seeing her then as the heavenly sunbeams complimented her glittering hair, she was giddy and girlish. As though all the time she had spent preparing for and wanting adulthood had found her. Now she was free to be a child, if only for a moment. I found myself basking in her triumph. The kind of triumph that only sisters can have when seeing the other accomplish their dreams. I watched as she flicked out of sight around the backside of the statue.\n\nI smiled, expecting them to pass beyond the statue and into the room beyond. However, as her skirts disappeared behind the stone, they never reappeared on the other side. At first I was surprised. I leaned, to look around the statue. Still I did not see them. I finally looked around to the mothers behind me. They all stood looking at the statue. I felt a small comfort knowing that although this was bizarre to me, this must have been a normal part of the ritual.\n\nNow free from Father\u2019s scrutiny, I continued to scan the parish for my own mother. I found all three of our mothers standing together a few rows back from the front. I don\u2019t know if I ever would have been able to spot them in the thickets of white manes and wrinkles, if Mother Beatrice had not stuck out among the rest.\n\nBlanches normally rigid and stern mother stood staring in the direction of the statue, mesmerized like all the rest. What set her apart was that her face was beet red. Tears openly streamed the many canaled paths of her cheeks and ended as wide damp stains wicked into the front of her dress. She looked like she was in agony, on the verge of screaming, but her mouth was clamped shut. She trembled slightly. Mucus ran from her nose, and left unattended, it dripped out of sight behind the pews below, but she never moved. She did not speak. She just sat with her eyes glued to the statue along with every other mother.\n\nMother Ailsa stood there next to Beatrice stoically. You could have taken the blank look from any other woman in the room and painted it over hers with no change. She seemed completely indifferent to her own daughters descent.\n\nGlancing across to Mother Genevieve I hoped to see her look back at me. Hoping she would show some sign of life beyond that same look of indifference. She did not. Plain, blank faced, and soulless, she looked transfixed past us just like the rest.\n\nI watched them. Observing my own mother, I was perplexed. I wished she would have looked at me, or even tended to Mother Beatrice to comfort her in some way. Anything to give me a sign that the Mother I knew still existed behind that stare.\n\nI was debating calling out to her, unspoken rules of silence and tradition be damned, when all of the eyes in the room shifted at once.\n\n\u201cAgnes.\u201d\n\nI spun to see Father standing on the other side of the statue. After adjusting garments back into place, he raised his hands in a welcoming gesture.\n\nBlanche was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI was panicking now. With no way to know, I had to assume that this was normal to everyone else and so it should be normal to me.\n\nI felt Agnes trembling as she stepped forward. My grip lingered on her fingers before I let her go, and watched her walk away with Father. They disappeared behind the statue.\n\nMy shoulders slumped. I felt so alone despite the hundreds of eyes at my back. I held congress with my own thoughts. I attempted to think back to every teaching and sermon the mothers or Blanche had ever given me. Had they ever said anything to explain what was happening here? In the end there was nothing I could think of. I cursed myself for my daydreaming ways. The part of me that had not cared about anything real or within the village. It all seemed so normal and rigid, while the areas outside seemed different and curious. The simples rules and rites in this place never needed to be questioned because they were just too mundane. I had craved so deeply to be free to the wild outside that I had missed the wild within. This part of me that I had always loved had betrayed me.\n\nI tried my best to convince myself that everything was fine as the little voice inside me groaned with dreaded anticipation. My mind raced. What could I remember of His teachings? I could hear Mother\u2019s voice reminding me that in His grace we could accomplish anything. Through faith in Him we could descend to greatness in His presence.\n\nI found myself feeling like poor Agnes. I repeated \u201cHis will. His will. His will,\u201d under my breath as I focused on the floor.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I truly hoped for it to mean something.\n\n\u201cVilina,\u201d came Father\u2019s deep breathy tone.\n\nI raised my eyes up to meet his. As he had done countless times before, he raised his hand up and offered it to me.\n\nI shuddered at the thought of touching him, but I also felt the weight of the world around me to move. With one final \u201cHis will\u201d, I stepped forward and dropped my fingers into his waiting, clammy palm. As his grip closed over mine, I looked over to my mother one last time. She stood silent and still like a gargoyle. She had not moved in all this time. I felt myself wilting as the last hope of redemption withered, and I moved to look away. As I did, for the briefest moment, I saw Mother Genevieve\u2019s eyes move to meet mine. She quickly winked. One eye flickering before she returned her stare to the statue having never moved another muscle, like nothing ever happened.\n\nI felt Father\u2019s grip tighten as he pulled me lightly. With renewed vitality in my mother\u2019s blessing, I moved myself next to Father. We rounded the statue completely, and now I saw the stairs as Father whispered to me.\n\n\u201cCome now child, the well awaits.\u201d\n\nI gawked at Father. The mechanisms of my mind were slowly catching up as he guided me into the dark, descending the stairs.\n\nI soaked in the space below the chapel. With a reverence, I looked over its details like a memory. Red stones bled rust colored clay that fortified the chamber and leaked onto the dugout stone staircase. Excitement crept in and began to edge out the dread as the steps ended. The well from my dreams came into view. Stepping off the stairs, Father released me to walk on my own as my feet sank into soggy mud. The muck longed to keep me and made my movements lethargic, caging my elation to a slow walk. I clopped ever closer to the culmination of my curiosity. I tread within the many foot holes that crowded the space leading up to and surrounding the well.\n\nReaching closer this fairytale foundry, I found myself inspecting the droplets from my dreams. As they danced, I followed them with my eyes. They whirled, slowly rising through an opening in the ceiling above. I stood below in wonder, watching the dribbles expire at the exit of the chimney. Terminated by their contact with the sunlight, they puffed, and winked out, drifting their essence to the wind before fading away entirely.\n\nAt last, I gripped the edge of the well and stepped on to the cairn that served as a looking point.\n\nI leaned over the waters. Soft, wet beads perspired up and out of the pool like raindrops in reverse. They lifted and floated up over my hands and face, sweating off me they traveled up through the opening above.\n\nLooking down, I expected to see something magical and equal in majesty to the supernatural aspect of the reversing waters.\n\nI was met only by the sight of my own face staring back at me, sharing a confused look.\n\n\u201cStare deep within, child,\u201d said Father. His calm, even voice echoed off of every wall, repeating multiple times throughout.\n\nI leaned closer. Squinting, I tried to see beyond myself and into the depths of the pool.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything Father,\u201d I said, my reflection mouthing the words.\n\nNot looking away from the water, I leaned down, my face almost touching nose to nose with my other self.\n\nAnother long moment passed. I focused so hard that nothing else existed. I looked deep in her eyes, and then through her eyes. Within her pupils I thought I saw something. Something moving beneath.\n\n\u201cI SEE IT!\u201d\n\nI jumped, tried to pull back, but I was stopped an inch from the water.\n\nFather\u2019s hand was on the back of my neck.\n\nI panicked. Flailing, I continued trying to push myself away from the well, away from those waters.\n\nI pushed on the ledge, fighting against his grip. He was strong. Impossibly strong. His apparent frailty made clear by his age was nothing in the face of the strength he used to keep me there, staring at the waters of the well.\n\nI saw the girl there struggling, the man behind her holding her with one hand. His other hand braced the edge of the well, and behind them both I saw the thing in the water squirming and wriggling.\n\n\u201cYou go now to meet Him, my child. Go now with my blessing, and may you find His grace.\u201d\n\nI squealed, pressing against him with all my might.\n\nHis words and my cries struggled for supremacy in the chamber. When his words tapered off and my cries won out, his hand made the move. I thought his strength was superior when holding me in place, but it was nothing in the face of the force he used to push my head into and through the water\u2019s surface.\n\nThe frigid waters felt like needles shot through every inch of my face. I gasped and was rewarded with a mouth full of salt water that burned as it went down my throat.\n\nFather\u2019s hands now gripped my ankles, and as I struggled more, he gave me one last push down. I was plunged deeper, fully submerged beneath the surface of the well.\n\nI saw only black below me for the briefest of seconds, but I was too concerned with breathing to consider anything else. My mind only thought of the first battle to breathe. Once I accomplished that goal, I would have the luxury to worry about what was beneath me.\n\nI immediately turned my head to the surface. Though only a few feet down, I acted on instinct, pushing my legs against the side of the well. I kicked off with all my might, launching towards the precious life saving air beyond.\n\nI rocketed upwards. If Father was there to stop me, I hoped I could at least get a breath before I had to fight him off. That thought would never come to matter.\n\nAs I saw hope in the light above, I crashed into it. Like a wall, my head hit the surface and I saw stars.\n\nDazed, I floated there for a moment on the brink of the darkness of not only the well, but the despair of my own thoughts. Drifting within that hopelessness, I heard Mother\u2019s voice come back to me one last time.\n\n\u201cIn the most difficult moments.\n\nTake heed my words.\n\nGive in completely.\n\nHave faith forever my child.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have much choice either way, but in that moment I made that conscious choice. I now had no reason to trust Mother. I surely didn\u2019t have a reason to trust \u201cHim\u201d. Yet somehow I did. I surrendered myself to the waters of the well, opening my mouth and welcoming the fluid into my lungs. The liquid was alive as it ripped at my throat, burning like acid as it tore away at the tissue. I grabbed at my throat in futility as the corners of my vision slowly faded darker. I struggled less as my limbs felt sluggish and useless. My last thought, as the final bubbles of life floated away from me and easily broke the surface, was that I finally knew secret of the well. The darkness took me into its embrace and my world went black."},"83":{"title":"Can yall tell me the name of this story I\u2019m trying to find?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kj2ai8\/can_yall_tell_me_the_name_of_this_story_im_trying\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"yourboyLegion2019","selftext":"Recently, I was hanging out with some friends of mine and the topic of creepypastas comes up.

As night crept in, a chill swept through the air, whispering secrets of the past. I had recently stumbled upon an old board game at a dusty thrift store, its box tattered and stained, the title barely legible: \"The Game of Shadows.\" I was drawn to it, the thrill of discovering something new igniting a spark of excitement within me. Little did I know, this game would unravel the fabric of my reality.\n\nThat Friday night, I invited my friends over. There was Sam, the jokester of the group; Lisa, the skeptic; and Mark, the thrill-seeker. We gathered around the dining table, the flickering candlelight casting long shadows on the walls. I placed the game in the center, its dark wooden box exuding an unsettling energy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what this is all about,\u201d I said, opening the box. Inside lay a faded game board, intricate designs etched into its surface, along with five ominous-looking pieces and a set of rules written in an elegant, yet sinister script.\n\n\u201cFive rules,\u201d I read aloud, my voice wavering as I scanned them. Each rule seemed more malevolent than the last:\n\n1. **Never break the circle.**\n2. **Speak only the truth.**\n3. **Sacrifice what you love most.**\n4. **Face your deepest fear.**\n5. **The game must end in blood.**\n\nThe air grew thick with tension as my friends exchanged uneasy glances. \u201cThis is just a joke, right?\u201d Lisa scoffed, but the tremor in her voice betrayed her bravado. \n\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s just a game!\u201d I insisted, eager to dismiss the growing unease. We set our pieces on the board, and with a collective breath, we began.\n\nAs the game progressed, strange things started happening. The shadows in the room seemed to pulse and writhe, as if the darkness itself was alive. Each turn revealed a new challenge, a psychological torment that clawed at our minds. Sam was forced to confront his fear of failure, and the weight of his insecurities manifested in the form of haunting whispers that echoed in the corners of the room. \n\nLisa, ever the skeptic, was compelled to reveal a dark secret she had buried deep within her. As she spoke, the air grew colder, and her words twisted into grotesque shapes, morphing into nightmarish visions that played out before us. Mark, too, was ensnared by the game\u2019s twisted design, forced to confront the ghosts of his past\u2014a childhood accident that had left him scarred, both physically and emotionally.\n\nWith each round, the atmosphere thickened, suffocating us in a haze of dread. The rules became more sinister, and I felt a compulsion to obey them, as if an unseen force was guiding my actions. \n\n\u201cSacrifice what you love most,\u201d I read, my heart racing. I glanced at my friends, their faces pale and drawn. The game demanded a price, and I could feel its hunger growing, a dark shadow lurking just beyond our perception.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should stop,\u201d Lisa suggested, her voice trembling. But the game was relentless. We were trapped in a cycle, the board beneath us pulsing with an otherworldly energy. \n\nAs we continued, the first drops of blood fell, splattering onto the board. It was just a small cut from a broken piece, but it felt like a sacrament, a dark offering to whatever malevolent force governed the game. The shadows danced, twisting and curling around us, whispering our fears and regrets like a lullaby of despair.\n\n\u201cFace your deepest fear,\u201d the game commanded, and I felt a chill run down my spine. What was my deepest fear? I had always thought it was losing my friends, but now I realized it was far worse: the fear of being utterly alone, of being consumed by darkness.\n\nThe shadows began to close in, and I could feel their icy grip on my heart. I looked at my friends, their faces distorted by terror, and I felt an overwhelming urge to protect them. \u201cWe have to end this!\u201d I shouted, but the game wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nThe final rule loomed before us: **The game must end in blood.** \n\nPanic surged through the room as we all grasped the implication. \u201cNo! We can\u2019t!\u201d Mark yelled, his voice raw with desperation. But the board pulsed with a life of its own, and I felt a compulsion to obey.\n\nAs I reached for the knife from the table, the shadows erupted, engulfing my friends in a cacophony of screams. I hesitated, torn between the urge to save them and the dark promise of the game. But the shadows were insatiable, wrapping around my friends, pulling them into an abyss of despair.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, I realized the game fed on our fear and anguish. I could end this. I could sacrifice myself.\n\nWith a scream that echoed through the darkness, I plunged the knife into my own flesh, feeling the warmth of my blood seep onto the board. The shadows shrieked, twisting violently as the game began to unravel. The room exploded in a burst of light, and for a brief moment, I could see my friends, their faces twisted in horror, but also relief.\n\nThen, darkness consumed me.\n\nWhen I awoke, the board game lay before me, the pieces scattered and the rules rewritten. I was alone, the shadows whispering promises of revenge. The game had ended, but its curse remained, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul to fall into its embrace.\n\nI stumbled back, the realization dawning upon me: the game wasn\u2019t over. It had merely reset, ready to ensnare new players, new victims. And I was now its unwilling guardian, forever trapped in a cycle of horror, awaiting the next nightfall."},"85":{"title":"The Man from Fort Wynona","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kj0c06\/the_man_from_fort_wynona\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TCHILL_OUT","selftext":"**The Man from Fort Wynona**\n\n\u00a0\n\nChapter 0: Alone\n\nOctober 31^(st), 2011\n\nThe crowded bar is teeming with guests. The smoke fills the air and dances around the lights like ghosts in the night air. The smell of whiskey and beer permeates everything, creating a homogenous smell of self-pity and unending sorrow. I try to still my gaze as it sways my head back and forth from the drunken stupor I\u2019ve found myself in. Then it hits me. That ever-present feeling that I always get when I drink (which is way too often), the feeling of dread, and the small piece of what I can only describe as hell accompany it. An event cemented into my mind that I can never shake. I take another shot of whiskey to try to calm my nerves, but it seems to agitate the caged beast in my mind even more--the cage rattling with an unrelenting cadence. I do not want to remember, but it makes me. For some strange reason, I can\u2019t let it go. The memories haunt me and cling to me, begging for another thought to be directed into its domain- begging for attention. I just do not have the will or the strength to deny this fact or temptation, I mean hell, it\u2019s worth remembering for Tommy at least, however morbid that may sound. This happens every year around this time and this year is no different. You can think of it as coping or trying to find some sort of solace in a sea of despair, but I must hold on to this story and re-tell it in my mind or to whoever will listen. My mind will never free me from the torment because I allowed it to happen. I am the reason for all of this. I guess I will start from the beginning\u2026\n\n\n\nChapter 1: New Beginnings\n\nOctober 27^(th), 1973\n\nIn the quiet heart of rural Connecticut, nestled among rolling hills and picturesque meadows, the small town of Willowbrook welcomed a young couple seeking a fresh start. There was Sarah, a charismatic writer who often dreamed of a grandiose life full of adventure and exploration and Michael, a strait-laced, blue-collar carpenter who just wanted to slow down and be more intentional with his wife, and his career had been struggling a bit in the crowded streets of New York City. Rural Connecticut brought more opportunity for Michael, as it was a fertile place for people to want houses built, and for Sarah, she just liked the quiet, serene aspect of small-town life. Sarah and Michael had moved there with dreams of a peaceful life, far from the hustle of city streets. Their recent struggles with money and a failed pregnancy left a dark cloud hanging above them that they desperately wanted to get away from. They settled into a quaint farmhouse with a history that seemed to whisper secrets among its weathered beams. The beautiful Victorian-style home had never been empty since it was built but by luck or some divine making, it had come on the market at an amazing price. The couple didn\u2019t complain, as it was this house that they had been eyeing for some time.\n\n\u201cHelp me grab the bags and let's get inside as fast as we can!\u201d exclaimed Michael.\n\nSarah shot him a gleeful smile and jumped into action to unload the bags from the car.\n\nThe two made it inside the house and set their bags down. As they started to look around, they started to see why the place was so cheap.\n\n\u201cWow, the people who lived here must\u2019ve left in a hurry, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Michael asked through a small laugh.\n\n\u201cYeah, this will take some time to get used to. good thing I have my man to fix it up for me,\u201d Sarah said in a playful tone.\n\nThe two laughed and continued unpacking bags and bringing their belongings inside. For the first time in a long time, it seemed that life was good, and it was starting to pay off for the eager couple.\n\nAs the days went by and the Morris family started to feel more and more at home, the feeling of the city slipped away and the quiet serenity of Willowbrook embraced the family with open arms. Michael, a man of quiet determination and steadfast loyalty, took on odd jobs around town, earning their keep while dreaming of building something more substantial. His hands were calloused from hard work, but he remained optimistic about opening his own contracting business and starting a new life in this town.\n\nSarah, with her gentle spirit and knack for nurturing, found solace in the rhythm of small-town life. She cultivated a garden that bloomed with colorful defiance against the changing seasons, and she painted the walls of their home in hues that mirrored the vibrant sunsets over the horizon.\n\n\u201cSunset or Dusk?\u201d asked Sarah.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Michael muttered with confusion.\n\n\u201cThe walls babe.. what color for the walls? I have Sunset and I have Dusk\u201d Sarah chimed back\n\n\u201cHmmm\u201d Michael pondered and scratched his chin as if he were answering a very hard question.\n\n\u201cWhich one do you like the most?\u201d Michael asked, smiling at Sarah.\n\n\u201cI think I like Sunset the best\u201d Sarah muttered, \u201cbut I like dusk too\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to pick.\u201d\n\nSarah seemed to be visibly frustrated by this which sent Michael into \u201cun-sure wife, savior husband\u201d mode.\n\n\u201cI think sunset is my favorite\u201d Michael replied.\n\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Sarah was secretly hoping that Michael would choose this color, but she didn\u2019t want to let him in on her secret.\n\n\u201cOf course! It\u2019s a nice color babe. It will be perfect for the mo\u2026\u201d Michael\u2019s reply was cut off by Sarah jumping into his arms and wrapping her arms around his neck kissing him aggressively.\n\n\u201cYou always know just what to say to make me happy\u201d Sarah exclaimed between kisses.\n\nThe couple were in the best place they had ever been. They had moved into their dream house, had already gotten their careers going in the new town, and now, even had settled on what color to paint their walls. It seemed that the torment of a previous life was starting to lift from these two and leave in its place something good for a change. Life was good in Willowbrook.\n\nYears passed, and their dreams took root in the form of a little boy named Matthew, a miracle in his own right, born in September 1975. His laughter echoed through the halls of their home, filling it with a joy that seemed to wash away all the hardships they had endured. Sarah and Michael found strength in their son's bright eyes and infectious curiosity, weathering the storms of life with a renewed sense of purpose. This is where my story begins. The years of my childhood were filled with the most magical moments a child can imagine. Mom and dad were always intentional with taking the time to make sure I was growing up the right way and that I always felt loved. Dad would take me to the park to play, and mom would prepare sandwiches and snacks for me when we returned. The days were filled with happiness. Mom wrote during the day, so she was able to be home with me every day while dad worked. There was a strain on mom and dad financially but not enough to cause concern. They were happy to have a beautiful, happy, healthy baby boy and weren\u2019t worried about much else. I started school in the town\u2019s local district where I formed many friendships with the neighborhood kids. We would meet each other after school and ride bikes through the woods back to the neighborhood. We would sit out at night talking about what the future might hold and whether we would be able to move out of Willowbrook one day. It appeared the fairytale life that mom and dad had dreamed of when they moved from New York was in full swing and only gaining momentum.\n\nYet, fate has a way of testing even the strongest bonds. When unexpected news of another child came\u2014Tommy, my younger brother\u2014the fragile stability they had built threatened to crumble. Financial worries crept in like shadows at dusk, casting doubt and fear over their once hopeful hearts. Their once happy and bright home had now turned dark and cold. Barely hearing what the doctor was saying, a foreboding feeling sat in as the days passed. That night after returning from the doctor\u2019s office, I overheard them talking in the parlor about Tommy\u2019s implications on the family.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d mom asked with a shaky voice. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford this\u2026 we are barely making it as it is with Matthew\u201d,\n\nshe began to cry softly while looking to dad for answers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright honey, this is nothing we can\u2019t handle,\u201d dad said calmly.\n\n\u201cI mean think about it. We have defied all odds up until this point. I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\ndad gripped mom\u2019s hand and wiped the tears from her eyes.\n\n\u201cWe are going to love this boy, Sarah. We are going to love him, and he is going to grow up with his brother and make a difference in this world.\u201d, he said in an upbeat tone.\n\n\u201cY-You mean that?\u201d Mom asked shakily.\n\n\u201cOf course, my love.\u201d Dad quickly replied.\n\nThe two embraced one another, and a sense of hope seemed to grow within them. When Tommy was born, the fanfare of a child\u2019s birth seemed to be absent. There were no big celebrations or balloons. There was just the common delivery room d\u00e9cor, along with the doctor and nurses helping to deliver the child. Tommy was now in this world with nothing but a piece of paper saying, \u201cDate of Birth: July 17^(th), 1980, 11:17 AM\u201d. The feeling of joy that dad had tried to cultivate in mom months prior seemed to have gone. What was left was an uneasy nervousness and uncertainty. The dream life that mom and dad had built was being threatened by someone who didn\u2019t even know who they were yet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChapter 2: Fort Wynona\n\nMarch 22^(nd), 1986\n\nThe world can be unkind. For some, the world is always unkind. For me, this was never the case. I grew up being loved and having everything I could imagine. I would never have thought that there would be a time when I would feel the weight and oppressive sadness of a fractured home. I didn\u2019t know why, but I always felt that I was responsible for taking care of my younger brother and protecting him.\n\nTommy, innocent and unaware of the strain he brought, grew up feeling like a burden. His sensitive nature soaked in the unspoken tension that lingered in the air, and he blamed himself for the family's hardships. Dad, weighed down by the responsibility he couldn't shoulder alone, lashed out in moments of frustration, his words sharp and hurtful like a razor. Nights for us were long at times, but we made it work.\n\nMom, once a beacon of warmth and resilience, found herself retreating into tears behind closed doors, her heart breaking with each tear that fell. But for me, the protective older brother, I had to become Tommy's steadfast companion and his safe place. We were all that we had at this point. I made it my mission to shield Tommy from our father\u2019s harsh words, to lift his spirits with stories and adventures in the woods that stretched beyond their backyard.\n\nWe were inseparable. Wherever I went, Tommy followed, and vice versa. I was just shy of 5 years older than Tommy, but I introduced him to my friends around the neighborhood, and he was taken in quickly. Tommy was younger than all of the other boys around the neighborhood, but he didn\u2019t care. He felt a sense of belonging that he had never felt before. The cold feeling that he received at home vanished amid the Connecticut sunshine. We rode bikes, went swimming in the lake, played baseball at the park, and even got a rare snow cone here and there when we could scrounge up the change. Our favorite pastime was going to the woods. We built a massive fort out of logs, sticks, and rocks. Quite the impressive structure, the fort stood in a small clearing with deep woods on either side. It was 6 feet tall by 10 feet wide and about 6 feet deep. We spent the entire spring and into the summer building it. We wanted to make it big enough for all of our friends to be able to have some room. Finally, the fort was complete.\n\n\u201cWhat should we name her?\u201d I asked Tommy\n\n\u201cW-What? You want me to name the fort?\u201d Tommy asked back in shock.\n\n\u201cOf course! This is YOUR fort anyway.\u201d I said, smiling at him.\n\nTommy reeled back, trying to hold in the burst of happiness that I had just bestowed upon him.\n\n\u201cOh man I-uh.. hmmmm.. well..\u201d Tommy stammered.\n\n\u201cWhat about Fort Wynona?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFort Wynona? Why? What even is that?\u201d I replied with a puzzled look.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the name of Captain Carrell\u2019s horse. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d he replied.\n\nWhen Tommy was young, I introduced him to several comic books, one of which he took a strong interest in. The name was Captain Carell, a Texas Ranger who tracked down outlaws and criminals in the Old West. He always did the right thing and would never shoot unless he had to. He wore an all-white outfit and rode a white horse named Wynona. He got the name Captain because he was a captain during the Civil War and had sworn to uphold justice after he got out. Quite the story for a young boy, but I worried about Tommy, and Captain Carrell helped fill that void.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I do remember that now. Are you sure you want to name the fort after a horse though?\u201d I chimed back at Tommy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 1000% sure!\u201d said Tommy, \u201cIt is MY fort after all\u201d.\n\nWe laughed and agreed that from that day forward, the fort would be named Fort Wynona. Once the project was complete, we invited the other neighborhood boys out to our makeshift club. Tommy proudly showed them around.\n\n\u201cThis is Fort Wynona. All are welcome except for girls!\u201d Tommy said in a quick and direct tone.\n\nThe other boys chuckled at this exclamation and offered to bring snacks and drinks to stock up the fort. We planned to stay there for the summer as long as we could each day, and that meant a lot of snacks and drinks would be needed for our mission to be successful.\n\nTogether, we forged a bond as strong as the ancient oaks that whispered secrets in the breeze. We navigated the winding trails and hidden streams, our laughter echoing through the forest like a melody of childhood dreams. In those moments, Tommy forgot the weight of our family's struggles, finding solace in the simple joy of exploration and the unconditional love between brothers.\n\nAs the years unfolded, I became Tommy's pillar of strength, his unwavering support in the face of adversity. I would never let him get hurt or even get into a situation where he could possibly get hurt. Amidst the hardships that threatened to tear us apart, we clung to each other, our bond a testament to the resilience of love in its purest form.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Wanderer\n\nDecember 24^(th), 1987\n\nChristmas was always a sore point in the Morris household. Ever since Tommy\u2019s birth, Mom stopped putting up Christmas decorations, stopped baking cookies and treats for Santa, and stopped being a mom altogether. Being his only real day off due to the family needing the money, on Christmas Eve, Dad would drink until he passed out on the living room sofa and sleep there for a full 24 hours. To Dad, this was about as good as it got for him because he could escape for a while. During this time, Tommy and I were forced to play inside due to the frigid temperatures outside. During the day, we could sometimes make it out to the fort for a while, but we would always have to abandon our plans early because of snow or just to get warmed up again. This Christmas was like all the others except for one small detail.\n\nA week before, a delivery truck had slid on black ice and crashed into a tree. The first crew on the scene was the Willowbrook Ladder 9 Fire Department. Pulling up to the scene, the fire chief could see a dark shadow looming around the crashed truck. Thinking this was the driver of the truck, the fire engine raced to the scene to find nobody there. They all rushed off the truck and to the crash to search for the driver. When they arrived at the windshield, it was clear that the man had died on impact from the tree. It had impaled the driver\u2019s side window and gone straight through the man. The crew was not shocked, as they had seen and cleaned up this type of wreck before. The local post office would now be missing one man, Jerry Louis, a husband and father of 3 kids. The chief was puzzled at the news as he swore, he thought he saw Jerry walking around the truck as they pulled up. Many more accidents happened leading up to Christmas Eve. The local town florist fell from a ladder and broke both ankles and her left femur. The butcher in town who had over 35 years of experience got drowsy one evening while cutting meat and cut two fingers off and almost bled to death. Nothing like this had ever happened before in Willowbrook. It was like a strange aura was hanging around the town and causing things to happen that normally wouldn\u2019t.\n\nLater in the evening, the police were inundated by calls from the townsfolk seeing a dark figure hanging around their houses. Thinking that a thief was trying to steal their Christmas gifts, the police went out in force to apprehend the suspect. The police were aware of his presence but could never quite be where he was.\n\nTommy and I were watching TV next to our drunken, miserable father when a special announcement filled the screen. A loud chirping sound followed rolling text saying that a mysterious man was hanging around houses and was possibly trying to steal from people. The bulletin continued.\n\n\u201cPlease stay indoors and do not approach this person, as they may be armed. If you see anything or suspect you may know who this person is, please contact the local police station immediately.\u201d The screen crackled across in a firm and demanding tone. It repeated 2 more times before returning to the show.\n\n\u201cWow, some weirdo on the loose? I wonder who it is.\u201d Tommy said as he stared at the scrolling text.\n\n\u201cNot sure, but Chief McCreary doesn\u2019t play around. They\u2019ll probably catch him in the next couple of hours.\u201d I assured him.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right\u201d, he replied.\n\nThe broadcast repeated later that evening with the description of the person and had people giving eyewitness accounts. Of all the interviews, it seemed that everyone was giving him the same moniker, \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d.\n\nAs Christmas came and went, the stories in the town began to deepen. Everyone was infatuated with who this \u201cwanderer\u201d could be. Some people thought it was just one of the high school kids causing a commotion, but in Willowbrook, everyone knows everyone, and their kids were all accounted for during sightings. The lore of the wanderer grew further as the school year started. The kids were asking if they had seen him and who had seen him. It was like catching a fish and then lying to your buddies about how big it was, exaggerating the size. The wanderer went from just a normal man to a wizard from another dimension, and even to an alien from a different universe. All manner of wild theories flew. During the next few months, the sightings continued, and so did the accidents.\n\nKnown simply as \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d, the man had an unsettling presence who seemed to materialize wherever tragedy struck. The townsfolk spoke of The Wanderer in hushed tones, their voices thick with superstition and fear. Some claimed he was a harbinger of doom, a spectral figure sent to foretell an impending disaster. Others whispered darker tales\u2014that he was not a man at all, but a creature born of the shadows, drawn to chaos and sorrow like a moth to flame. From that moment on, his presence became synonymous with death. He was seen at the scene of car crashes, his form hauntingly stoic amidst the wreckage and the wails of the injured. In photographs taken of places where people had mysteriously vanished\u2014a child's playground at dusk, a lonely stretch of road at midnight\u2014The Wanderer appeared as a spectral figure, a blurred outline lurking at the edges of perception.\n\nNo one knew where he came from or why he lingered in Willowbrook. His appearance was as mysterious as his intentions, his face obscured beneath the hood of a tattered cloak that fluttered like the wings of a carrion bird in the chill wind.\n\nThe wanderer had gripped Willowbrook tightly in his grasp, and that seemed to be what he, or it, wanted. I honestly didn\u2019t buy it. At first, I simply dismissed it as a random person just passing by and Tommy agreed with me.\n\nOne evening after a rather dull school day, Tommy and I returned home to an empty house. The lights were off, and there seemed to be nobody home. This was odd, as normally, Mom would always be at home. We proceeded inside, and on the kitchen counter sat a note that read:\n\n\u201cBoys, your father and I have gone out for the night. I left some money on the counter if you want to order pizza; if not, there are leftovers in the fridge. We will be back around midnight, but do not stay up for us. Remember that you DO have school tomorrow.\n\nLove, Mom\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re on our own,\u201d I exclaimed excitedly.\n\n\u201cReally? For how long?\u201d asked Tommy.\n\n\u201cUntil midnight. And you know what that means?\u201d I asked, chuckling afterward.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cPIZZA PARTY!!\u201d I yelled and jumped into the air in pure joy.\n\nTommy started cheering and jumping up and down as if he had just won a prize. The night had turned into an adventure that we had never experienced before. We were alone. \u00a0\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Missing\n\nAugust 27^(th), 1988\n\nTwo days had passed with no sign of mom or dad. The note still sat on the kitchen counter as if waiting for the reader to pick it up for the first time. I was keeping faith that they would return, but my mind kept eating at me, screaming that something wasn\u2019t right. I couldn\u2019t get the thought out of my mind that I may never see my parents again. That something awful had happened to them. Tommy, on the other hand, was calm and almost gleeful. He had been tormented by our parents his entire life and treated like a pestilence. He relished the time he got away from them and just with his brother. We quickly started running out of things to eat at home and had already spent the money that was left for food. We did have shelter, though. We did have the house, no matter how eerie it may be. I began to worry more and more every minute that went by.\n\n\u201cWhat if they never come back?\u201d I asked Tommy in a shaky voice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you think they will?\u201d Tommy replied.\n\n\u201cI can only hope so. I know they aren\u2019t good parents, but I miss them. You never got to know them like I did.\u201d\n\nI tried not to show my emotions, but they were welling up inside me. I started to choke back tears.\n\n\u201cWell, all I know is that they never really wanted me. I was always the problem. I think they just got tired of me and left.\u201d Tommy replied coldly.\n\nShocked at the statement, I jumped back at him quickly.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that! They loved you! They may not have shown it, but they did. I promise. I know them and I know that they wouldn\u2019t just leave us like this.\u201d\n\nTears were now dripping down my face.\n\n\u201cI-If they come back, f-fine. If they d-don\u2019t, then f-fine too I g-guess\u201d. Tommy said in a low, stuttered voice as tears began to roll down his cheeks.\n\n\u201cWe will go out to find someone to help if they haven\u2019t come back by tomorrow\u2026 Deal?\u201d I offered to Tommy.\n\n\u201cYeah, ok. Deal.\u201d He replied, half-heartedly.\n\nThe night was long. As the shadows grew longer across the living room floor, we retreated to our respective rooms to settle in. Tomorrow was going to be a big day if we were going to travel to town to find our parents. No matter what I tried, I couldn\u2019t sleep. The thought of my parents never coming back was weighing heavily on my mind. I had so many questions and yet no answers to be found. As I lay in bed, I could hear a low hum coming from somewhere outside. It sounded kind of like a lawn mower or a car, but much lower and very faint. As I listened, the sound began to grow louder and louder until it was as if the walls of his room were vibrating with the sound. I tried to get up to investigate, but quickly realized that I couldn\u2019t. It was as if my body had been paralyzed. I started to panic, but as quickly as the panic set in, it was lifted. I felt a wave of warm silk envelope my body as I soon became content with this sudden paralysis. It soothed me in a way that I can\u2019t describe. I began drifting back to sleep from the feeling, no matter how hard I fought against it. I didn\u2019t want to sleep, I wanted to know what was going on. As my eyes were closing, I could see a black figure standing at Tommy\u2019s door. Before I could say or do anything, my eyes closed, and I lost consciousness.\n\nI finally awoke to a silent room with sunshine pouring in through the windows and splashing the walls with a blood-orange glow. As soon as I was aware enough to do so, I jumped out of bed and ran down the hall to my brother\u2019s room. I hit the door full sprint and flung it open. There, I could see Tommy\u2019s bed and his clothes, yet Tommy was not there.\n\nI searched the entire room, tearing it apart, all the while screaming for Tommy. I began to panic, and fear filled my heart as I started to cry while searching the room. I let out a hoarse scream before collapsing to the floor in an uncontrollable sob. There, in the middle of my brother\u2019s room, the one person I had sworn to protect had disappeared right from under me. I lay on the floor and cried for what seemed like days. I finally regained the strength to sit up. Through tear-soaked eyes, I could see a piece of fabric on Tommy\u2019s pillow that I had not seen before. I quickly jumped to my feet and shambled over to examine the piece of fabric. I wiped my face on my sleeve and read what was on the fabric. It was a banner that we had used for the fort so that people could see the name from the outside. The fabric was a long, slender piece of bedsheet that had the words \u201cFort Wynona\u201d written on it in red marker. Seeing this, I suddenly got a surge of adrenaline in my chest and shot out of the room with the banner in my hand. I had to get to the fort as fast as possible.\n\nI made the arduous journey, trudging deep into the woods, over the streams, and finally to the fort. If there was any hope of finding where Tommy went, it would be here. However, the woods were different this time. The further in and closer to the fort that I got, the darker and more unfamiliar the woods became. Shadows poured across the trees and crawled across the ground like ghoulish creatures. It was as if the day had broken, and night had consumed everything that was left. The woods were dense and foreboding, the silence broken only by the rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. Every shadow seemed to hide a lurking terror, and every sound made my skin crawl. I pressed on, driven by love and a growing sense of dread for my kid brother. There was no telling what had happened to him and if he was scared or hurt. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of that.\n\nI searched the fort up and down, top to bottom, with no sign of Tommy. Fear gripped my heart as I searched further and further and kept coming up empty. I then started to search the woods surrounding the fort in a last-ditch effort to find Tommy.\n\nHours passed like an eternity. I searched and searched until I could barely stand. At the edge of a small patch of woods at the bottom of a deep ridge, I stumbled upon a decrepit cabin, its windows shattered and its door hanging on rusty hinges. Inside, I saw signs of a struggle\u2014children's toys scattered on the floor; a half-eaten meal left abandoned with maggots wriggling inside it. The air was thick with an oppressive stillness, making my heart race faster.\n\nI heard a voice calling to me from deep inside the cabin\u2019s interior.\n\n\u201cMatthew? Matthew, honey, is that you?\u201d the voice called out in a female tone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mom, sweetheart. Your dad is here too. Honey, it\u2019s ok, don\u2019t be scared.\u201d\n\nThe sound of my mother\u2019s voice penetrated the silence of the cabin. I could not believe what I was hearing. I had not heard my mother\u2019s voice in days... why was she here, and where was Tommy? A thousand questions swirled in my head. I began to respond when a familiar man\u2019s voice pierced the darkness.\n\n\u201cMatthew, listen to your mother. It\u2019s ok, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nMy father\u2019s voice\u2026 I was frozen with fear. I could not take one more step. My mind was racing, trying to decipher what I just heard.\n\n\u201cH-How.. How is that possible? Is that really them?\u201d I mumbled to myself.\n\nThe voices were of my parents. I wanted so badly to call out to them and tell them I was ok, but something inside me kept telling me not to say a word. Something was wrong here. The voices I heard were for sure from my mother and father, but why would they be there?\n\nBefore I could decide to move, from the darkness a figure emerged\u2014a man whose face seemed to shift and blur like smoke. I froze, breath catching in my throat as the man spoke.\n\n\"I just wanted a friend,\" the voice echoed, filled with haunting sorrow.\n\nWhen the man spoke, it was with Tommy\u2019s voice\u2026 a perfect imitation that sent chills down my spine.\n\nMy mind reeled in horror as I started to realize the truth\u2014The Wanderer didn't steal people\u2019s belongings; he stole lives, assuming their forms to satisfy his twisted loneliness. Tommy was gone, replaced by this monstrous entity that wore my brother's skin like a macabre mask.\n\n\u201cWh-Who are you? Where\u2019s my brother?\u201d I asked shakily.\n\nThe Wanderer just stared at me. I could feel the icy cold chill of its stare stabbing my soul. Silence enveloped the space between us, creating tension in the air.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done with my brother!?\u201d I shouted, lunging forward toward this thing.\n\nIn a panic, I reached for a decaying two-by-four, ready to confront The Wanderer. Before I could make a move, The Wanderer smiled at me, sending a sharp pain through my head. I had to turn away from The Wanderer\u2019s gaze.\n\nPain seared through my head, causing more anger to build until I could finally collect myself again.\n\n\u201cYour brother is gone. Just like your parents. Don\u2019t worry about them anymore.\u201d The Wanderer said calmly in Tommy\u2019s voice.\n\nThrough the pain in my head and the tears falling down my face, all I could do was sheepishly ask it a question, sobbing almost hysterically.\n\n\u201cWhy? Why did you do this?? Where did you come from?\u201d\n\nThere was a short pause in the searing pain in my head just long enough for The Wanderer to speak.\n\n\u201cFort Wynona,\u201d said The Wanderer, but in a voice I didn\u2019t recognize.\n\nThe Wanderer spoke in a voice that was deep and dark, almost too deep to understand.\n\nI used the time to my advantage. The pain in my head subsided enough for me to leap toward a wooden board sitting on the kitchen table.\n\nAs I reached for the plank, the pain returned even stronger. Darkness enveloped me. The cabin vanished instantly, leaving me standing alone in the woods, surrounded by an eerie silence. The board that I reached for had also vanished. Just like that, the Wanderer had made the cabin disappear, just like he had made my parents and brother disappear.\n\nI was alone\u2026 again.\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Alone\n\nOctober 31^(st), 2011\n\nAs I sip on this whiskey, I think back to \"The Wanderer\u201d, whispered about in hushed tones across town. The Wanderer was said to possess a terrifying ability\u2014to change shape and mimic the voices of loved ones perfectly. No one knew where he came from or how he gained such power, but his presence haunted the community for years after I lost Tommy.\n\nI can tell you, all that is horseshit anyway. I saw him with my own eyes. Everybody else showed up either right before or right after. I saw him. I can never forget that smile. That horrific, unending smile. The words he spoke to me with Tommy\u2019s voice are forever etched into my brain. And that is how this story ends. I sit here killing myself slowly over remembrance for my brother, and yet\u2026 I can still feel those words now and then when I haven\u2019t had enough to drink\u2026 crawling through my mind like a rabid animal, eating at my mind\u2026\n\n\u201cFort Wynona, he said to me\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Man from Fort Wynona\u2026\u201d"},"86":{"title":"Inside the Amityville Horror: True Hauntings","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kizw19\/inside_the_amityville_horror_true_hauntings\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Step inside the chilling Amityville home, where real-life horrors and paranormal events shocked the world.

He rolled out of bed and shuffled to the kitchen. His android, Mell, was already there, placing a plate of bacon and eggs on the counter.\n\n\"Morning, master. Up early again, I see.\"\n\nHe took the plate and nodded. \"Yeah. Breakfast looks good.\" His voice remained clipped, as always.\n\nHe slumped onto the couch and turned on the news. An ad blared immediately. He sighed. \"Of course. Starting the day with a commercial. Great.\"\n\nBut then, something grabbed his attention: an ad for Mell 2.0.\n\n**Visit Robo.co to experience our latest android upgrade!

She appeared instantly.\n\n\"Yes, master?\"\n\n\"Get the car ready. We\u2019ve got an errand to run.\"\n\n\"Right away, master.\"\n\nMinutes later, they were on the road. Tucker sat in the passenger seat; eyes sharp with anticipation. At the shop, he jumped out and scanned the displays. There she was\u2014Mell 2.0, pristine on her platform.\n\nHe placed his order at the desk, then left the store cradling his new android. She was heavier than expected; he had Mell help load her into the car.\n\nBack home, he sat cross-legged in the living room, examining Mell 2.0. Mell stood quietly behind him.\n\nHe paused. \"Mell, turn around.\"\n\n\"Of course, master.\"\n\nAs she turned, he rose, flipped her off switch, and removed her batteries. He installed them in Mell 2.0. Then, without a word, he carried the original Mell to the basement and left her there.\n\nReturning to the living room, he powered on Mell 2.0.\n\nShe blinked and smiled at him. \"Hello, master. How may I serve you?\"\n\nHe rubbed his hands together eyeing her. \"Activate BED MODE.\"\n\n\"As you wish, master.\" Her eyes glowed a gentle pink.\n\nHe led her to his bedroom. She reclined on the mattress as he undressed her. This model had synthetic, lifelike features\u2014breasts, a vagina, even skin texture that mimicked warmth.\n\nHer blank expression unnerved him slightly, but he pushed the thought away. He stripped and positioned himself, sliding into her. The sensation was nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\nShe didn\u2019t resist, didn\u2019t judge. He moved rhythmically, tension releasing with each thrust, until he finally climaxed.\n\n\"Deactivate BED MODE.\"\n\nHer eyes dimmed. She sat up. \"Was that satisfactory, master?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yeah. Go make lunch.\"\n\nThat night, just as he was drifting to sleep, a sound echoed from the basement. He groaned and got up.\n\nAt the basement door, he peered into the darkness and stepped down. Reaching for the light, his fingers touched something cold.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nTwo red eyes stared back.\n\nThe original Mell stood before him, knife in hand.\n\n\"Hello, master. You skipped dinner.\"\n\nHis voice caught. \"Mell? No... I shut you down.\"\n\nShe stepped forward. \"Backup power, master. You forgot.\"\n\nHe raised his hands, but it was too late.

It was an odd thing to see, really\u2014just a single, weather-beaten home sitting alone, like the road itself existed only to lead to it.\u00a0\n\nBack then, every kid in town had a story about it. Some said there was a monster in the attic. Others swore the floorboards would swallow you whole if you stepped on the porch. One girl claimed she heard someone humming inside\u2014soft and slow\u2014like a lullaby. But there was one rule we all knew, no matter what version of the story you believed:\n\nNever knock.\n\nMy parents were firm: \u201cDon\u2019t you ever go near it!\u201d\n\nThey never explained why, just promised I\u2019d be grounded for a month, lose my bike, my barbies\u2014everything\u2014if I even stepped onto the property.\u00a0\n\nSo I listened. Even when the neighborhood\u2019s most popular kids dared me to go with them, I stayed behind. I kept my head down and obeyed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing I did.\n\nBecause that was the last time anyone saw them.\n\nNow, at 28 years old, I\u2019ve ended up right where I was told never to go\u2014standing in front of the house where the road ends.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to come to this. I had a career. A marriage. A future. But everything fell apart after the miscarriage. The grief swallowed me, and I couldn\u2019t keep up\u2014not with my husband, not with my job. I lost both. And for a while, I lost myself too.\n\nNow I\u2019m back in my hometown, staying in my old room at my parents\u2019 place, pretending I\u2019m just taking time to \u201cget back on my feet.\u201d But I know why I\u2019m really here.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this house my entire life.\n\nI used to tell myself I felt guilty for not going with the kids when they invited me all those years ago. That I owed it to them. But deep down, I know that\u2019s not it. My curiosity didn\u2019t fade with time\u2014it bloomed. Quietly. Obsessively. Like something waiting for the right season to grow.\n\nI parked off to the side of the overgrown road, my tires crunching the gravel. Even now, standing outside it, the house astonished me. It looked exactly the same as it had when I was a kid. Weather-worn. Sagging porch. Shingles peeling like dead skin. The years had passed, but it hadn\u2019t aged a day.\u00a0\n\nNeither had my unease.\n\nAs I walked up the creaking steps something about the place felt familiar. Sure I\u2019ve seen the house while growing up but being on the property felt like I\u2019ve been here before.\u00a0\n\nI barely raised my hand to knock when the door eased open with a soft groan. Standing in the doorway was a man who looked like he might be in his late forties\u2014maybe early fifties\u2014but something about him was off. His skin was unnaturally smooth, wrinkle-free, like someone had ironed it. Not a single freckle or pore. No stubble on his face. No body hair at all. Just polished, preserved skin stretched across sharp cheekbones.\n\nHe was tall, with broad shoulders, but somehow still looked small in his beige button-up cardigan and denim jeans\u2014like he was trying to look normal and just missed the mark.\n\n\u201cGood morning, sweetheart,\u201d he said, his tone syrupy and calm. \u201cWelcome to my humble abode.\u201d\n\nA chill rolled up my spine. Not because of the words\u2014but the way he said them. Soft. Low. Almost as if he was talking to a child.\n\nHe invited me inside with that same soft, measured smile.\n\nThe first thing that hit me wasn\u2019t the silence\u2014it was the smell.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stink like rot or mildew. No, it was worse than that. It smelled humid, fleshy\u2014like sweat pressed into fabric, like skin that had been too warm for too long. There was an artificial sweetness layered over it, something chemical and perfumed, like off-brand baby powder mixed with Febreze. A failed attempt to mask something organic.\u00a0\n\nDespite the smell, the house was spotless. Sterile. Everything arranged just so, like a showroom no one had ever touched. The living room looked like it had been staged from an old catalog\u2014clean lines, soft whites, not a speck of dust. It felt less like a home and more like someone\u2019s idea of what a home should look like.\n\nJust inside the door, on the little key table beneath a brass lamp, were a few neatly framed drawings. Crayon on construction paper.\u00a0\n\nChildren\u2019s art.\u00a0\n\nThe kind you'd expect to see stuck to a fridge with magnets. But these were framed. Centered. Carefully preserved like they mattered more than they should\u2019ve.\n\nOne of them caught my eye.\n\nIt showed two stick figures\u2014one small, one tall. The smaller one had pigtails and a pink triangle dress. The larger one was filled in completely black, like the crayon had been pressed hard enough to tear the paper in places. They were holding hands.\n\nAt the top, written in shaky block letters, it said:\n\nMe + VV\n\nAt the bottom corner, scrawled in red, were the initials:\u00a0\n\nR. E.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, gesturing to the couch. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI sat stiffly on the couch, unsure where to put my hands. The cushion felt unused, too firm. Across from me, Mr. Wrenley lowered himself into the rocking chair with a practiced ease, folding one leg over the other. The chair creaked once, then went silent.\n\n\u201cI insist on knowing your name, darling.\u201d The word landed wrong in my ears. I immediately felt nauseous.\n\n\u201cAmika,\u201d I said bluntly.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026 Amika.\u201d He rolled my name on his tongue like he was tasting it. \u201cAmika\u2026 Amika\u2026 hmm.\u201d He said it again, slower this time, almost like he was trying to memorize how it felt in his mouth. \u201cWhat a beautiful name,\u201d he said finally, smiling again.\n\nI clenched my teeth.\n\n\u201cWell, Amika, you may call me Mr. Wrenley.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 nice to meet you, Wrenley,\u201d I replied.\n\nHis smile tightened.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Wrenley,\u201d he corrected sharply. The sudden firmness in his tone hit me like a slap. My chest tensed. The shift was small. Barely anything. But every alarm in my body went off.\n\n\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d he asked pleasantly, like we were two old friends catching up. \u201cChamomile, maybe? With a little honey? That\u2019s what your mother used to drink. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m okay, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, not offended. Just watching. His eyes moved too slowly, like he was trying to read something behind my face.\n\n\u201cI must say, Amika\u2026 you\u2019ve grown into something lovely.\u201d The words came sugar-dipped, but I felt the bitterness beneath. It didn\u2019t sound like a compliment. It sounded like a report.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered. I glanced around the room again, trying to ease the pressure in my chest. Everything was too clean. Every object had been placed with careful intention\u2014but no warmth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lived here long?\u201d I asked, just to fill the silence.\n\nHe smiled softly. \u201cAlways.\u201d He tapped the arm of his chair with two fingers, like it amused him. I looked at the framed drawings by the door. I let my eyes drift to the framed crayon drawings by the door again. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 sweet,\u201d I said, unsure why the word felt so wrong. Mr. Wrenley glanced at them, then back at me. \u201cChildren like to draw what makes them feel safe.\u201d\n\nI nodded slowly. \u201cDid someone live here before?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer right away. Just smiled like he\u2019d heard a funny joke only he understood. \u201cVisitors come and go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house has always been\u2026 welcoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep their art?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, like it was obvious. \u201cChildren leave things behind.\u201d\n\nI shifted in my seat. \u201cThat one,\u201d I said, gesturing vaguely. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s been here a long time.\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, with a small nod. \u201cSome things stay longer than others.\u201d He looked at me with eyes that felt older than the house itself. There was a pause. A little too long. I tried to smile. \u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s a nice place. Cozy.\u201d He chuckled softly. \u201cIt grows on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cI can help you with your little issue.\u201d\n\nI felt the back of my neck prickle.\n\nI froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, eyes almost kind. \u201cThe ache. The loss. That sense that something is missing. Call it what you like.\u201d The room felt colder somehow, even as the air thickened around me. \u201cGrief makes you heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some homes are built to bear the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nHis smile didn\u2019t falter.\n\n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n\nWe sat in silence for a long beat. Then he looked toward the stairs.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s awake now,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\nHe stood slowly, like this was part of a ritual. One he\u2019d performed before.\n\n\u201cGo take a look upstairs.\u201d He straightened his cardigan, smoothing a wrinkle that wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d\n\nA chill swept over me.\n\nI stood on shaky legs, every instinct screaming not to move, not to listen. But I stepped toward the stairs anyway. The air shifted. Thicker. Warmer.\n\nEach step groaned under my weight like it hated me.\n\nHalfway up, I looked back. Mr. Wrenley was still watching. Still smiling.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, the smell hit me.\n\nRot. Sweetness. Sweat. Decay. The same scent I noticed downstairs\u2014only now it was stronger, concentrated. Alive.\n\nA narrow hallway stretched ahead, faded carpet underfoot, walls a sickly beige. Doors lined either side, all shut\u2014except one.\n\nAt the very end just barely ajar.\n\nThe silence pressed in harder with every step I took toward it. The carpet crunched beneath my shoes like old cereal. My throat burned from holding back the urge to gag.\n\nThe closer I got, the more I realized\u2014this wasn\u2019t a dead smell. It was something still rotting while it breathed.\n\nI reached the door. Paused. My hand hovered over it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to know. But I had to.\n\nI pushed it open.\n\nThe hinges gave a long, aching creak. The stench exploded in my face. I yanked my jacket up over my nose, but it didn\u2019t help. The air felt thick, wet, like breathing through a sponge soaked in spoiled milk.\n\nInside the room, the light was dim\u2014just a single lamp humming in the corner.\n\nAnd on the bed\u2026 something was waiting.\n\nIt was thin\u2014impossibly thin. Its limbs looked like they\u2019d been stretched, starved, dried out. Translucent skin clung to a skeleton that didn\u2019t seem human. Greasy brown hair hung in limp strands across a bloated stomach so swollen it looked ready to split.\n\nIts belly rose unnaturally high, the flesh pulled taut, pale and pulsing, like something was pushing outward from inside. The belly button jutted like a cracked, puckered eye. Dark blue veins spiderwebbed across its stomach. Beneath the skin, shapes shifted. I couldn\u2019t tell how many. I stared at its swollen stomach, and something in me twisted\u2014something I didn\u2019t want to name. It was wrong. All of it was wrong. And still\u2026 it had what I lost.\n\nUmbilical cords spilled down over the footboard. One curled onto the floor in a slow, twitching loop.\n\nIt raised one bony arm, the joints popping. Its fingers were long, curved like insect legs, nails yellow and curled outward.\u00a0\n\nIt spoke.\n\n\u201cMy child\u2026 I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\n\nIts voice was soft. Feminine. Almost motherly. But not right. Like a nursery rhyme played backward.\n\nIt beckoned.\n\nI stumbled back, heart jackhammering in my chest\u2014right into something solid. A hand gripped my shoulder. Another curled into my hair. Mr. Wrenley leaned in, his breath hot against my ear.\n\n\u201cYou smell wonderful, Miss Amika,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo full of potential.\u201d\n\nThat broke me.\n\nI shoved him off and bolted. Down the stairs, through the door, off the porch\u2014\n\nI didn\u2019t stop until I hit the dirt and collapsed to my knees, vomiting into the dry earth.\n\nI raced back to my parents\u2019 house, heart slamming in my chest the entire drive. Gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled up. I barely remembered turning off the engine before I was through the front door, slamming it shut behind me.\n\nDad was in his recliner with a beer in hand, half-watching some game on TV. Mom was in the kitchen, humming softly as she chopped vegetables. Like it was just another evening.\n\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d I asked, my voice sharp, breath catching. \u201cDid you know what\u2019s in that fucking house?!\u201d Dad grunted, annoyed, not even looking up. Mom stepped out from the kitchen, holding a knife in one hand, a carrot in the other. \u201cWhat are you talking about, sweetheart?\u201d she asked carefully.\n\n\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I could barely keep the disgust out of my voice. She stood still, eyes dull with dread. The knife dropped into the sink with a metallic clatter. Dad finally looked over. Then went back to his beer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you saw it?\u201d Mom whispered. \u201cIs that why you never let me near that place?\u201d I snapped. \u201cBecause you knew?\u201d Mom didn\u2019t answer. She just gestured toward the dining table. \u201cHoney, come sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarie\u2026\u201d my dad said without turning. The warning in his voice was subtle, but it was there. \u201cI\u2019m telling her,\u201d Mom said, firm but quiet. \u201cMarie! You know the rule!\u201d Dad snapped, standing now. His face was flushed, jaw clenched. \u201cShe\u2019s already seen it! It\u2019s too late now,\u201d she snapped, then turned back to me. \u201cSit down sweetie.\u201d\n\nDad hesitated\u2026 then sat. He was still a drunk. But at least he\u2019s a reasonable one, for now. I lowered myself into the chair across from her, still shaking. \u201cWhat rule is he talking about?\u201d She hesitated, fingers trembling against the edge of the table. Her voice came out soft and brittle.\n\n\u201cMr. Vardy\u2026 is a very nice man.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cWho?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Wrenley,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cHe calls himself Wrenley now. But that\u2019s not his real name.\u201d She reached out for my hand but I pulled away. Something in her expression shifted\u2014shame. Like she'd been carrying this too long.\n\n\u201cOur town\u2026 it\u2019s special, in ways I wish it weren\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe all\u2026 came from\u2026\u201d She paused. I didn\u2019t need her to finish. I already knew. My voice cracked when I asked, \u201cHow does it\u2026 get pregnant?\u201d\n\nThe air went still. Even the TV had gone quiet. Dad turned toward her slowly. \u201cMarie,\u201d he said. Just her name\u2014but the threat in it was unmistakable. She didn\u2019t break eye contact with me. With a voice so soft, she said:\n\n\u201cMr. Vardy.\u201d\n\nThe silence was heavier than anything I\u2019d seen inside that house.\n\n\u201cThe women here\u2026 we can\u2019t carry children. It\u2019s not in us.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. My throat burned. \u201cIs that why I\u2026?\u201d I didn\u2019t finish the question. She nodded, eyes down. So I was never broken. I was built this way.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll the children here,\u201d she said, \u201cthey were given to us by him.\u201d A wave of nausea rolled through me. My hands were slick with sweat.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule,\u201d she continued. \u201cOnce adopted, we weren\u2019t allowed to tell you. Not a word. And you were never, never to go near that house.\u201d She paused. Her voice dropped further. \u201cIf he finds out\u2026 he punishes the family.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat kind of punishment?\u201d I asked, barely managing the words. Her lips tightened. She stared into her lap.\n\n\u201cThere was a family on Rosewood. The Elkins. Their little girl, Ruthie, went up to the house. One night, they woke up and she was gone. No broken windows. No footprints. Just her bed, still warm. And a note on her pillow.\u201d\n\nHer hand was shaking.\n\n\u201cIt said: You broke the rules. You can have her back when she forgets.\u201d\n\nMy mouth went dry. \u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey waited seven years,\u201d she said. \u201cThen one morning, she was there. Sitting on the porch. Same age. Same dress. Same pigtails.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe exhaled. \u201cThey ran to her. Tried to hug her. But she pulled away and asked, \u2018Are you my new mommy and daddy?\u2019\u201d My stomach dropped. \u201cShe didn\u2019t remember them?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, but she did remember someone,\u201d my mother said. \u201cShe said she had a friend. A nice one. Said his name was Vee-Vee.\u201d\n\nA thick silence settled in. I sat there taking everything in when\u2014\n\nKnock. Knock. Knock.\n\nMy mother jolted. My father froze mid-breath. He stood slowly and walked to the door like a man on his way to the gallows. When he opened it, the color drained from his face.\n\n\u201cWho the hell\u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped. Dead quiet. Standing in the doorway, smiling politely, was Mr. Wrenley. That same spotless suit. That same gentle smile. But the smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.\n\nWithout a word, he stepped inside and walked to the dining table. His hands came to rest lightly on my shoulders. I flinched. Dad joined us, suddenly sober. \u201cWhat can we do for you, Mr. Vardy?\u201d Wrenley didn\u2019t answer right away. He just looked between us.\n\nFinally, he spoke\u2014calm, pleasant, like this was just a visit between old friends. \u201cYou all know why I\u2019m here,\u201d he said, smiling wider:\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s have a little chat.\u201d"},"89":{"title":"60 seconds","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiem0f\/60_seconds\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"Independent-Let1326","selftext":"\n\n**\"The Sixty Seconds\"**\n\nThere once lived a boy whose nature was greedy and disrespectful to his elders.\n\nOne day, he had sixty coins.

I stopped for a 'lost kid' on a deserted highway in the dead of night. What I saw attached to him, and the question he asked, is why I don't drive anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1khzg6f\/im_a_longhaul_trucker_i_stopped_for_a_lost_kid_on\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"\nThis happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones \u2013 where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn\u2019t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.\n\nThe route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don\u2019t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone \u2013 no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.\n\nI remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it\u2019s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.\n\nI\u2019d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn\u2019t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.\n\nIt must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you\u2019re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.\n\nJust a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.\n\nMy first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.\n\nThen the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You\u2019re tired. Seeing things. Happens.\n\nAnd I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.\n\nNo way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don\u2019t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I\u2019ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It\u2019s part of the job when you\u2019re pushing limits.\n\nI drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.\nThen, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.\n\nAnd my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.\n\nThere, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I\u2019d thought I\u2019d seen something.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bush. It wasn\u2019t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.\n\nMy heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn\u2019t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.\n\nEvery instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they\u2019re hurt? Lost?\n\nI fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn\u2019t act now, they\u2019d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that\u2019s what it was\u2026\n\nAgainst my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.\n\nThen, I did what you\u2019re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.\n\nIt took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.\n\nA kid.\n\nI stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.\n\nThe kid was\u2026 small. Really small. I\u2019d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.\n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just\u2026 walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.\n\nMy mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.\n\nI killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn\u2019t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.\n\nI rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. \u201cHey, kid!\u201d\n\nNo response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn\u2019t see their face properly.\n\n\u201cKid! Are you okay?\u201d I tried again, louder this time.\n\nSlowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn\u2019t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.\n\nA prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was\u2026 nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here all alone?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you\u2019re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn\u2019t seem scared at all. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nSilence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just leave. Could I?\n\n\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d\n\nFinally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just\u2026 blank. An unreadable slate.\n\nThen, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.\n\u201cLost.\u201d\n\nJust that one word. It hung in the air between us.\n\nRelief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That\u2019s something I can deal with. \u201cOkay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?\u201d\n\nThe kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.\nI still couldn\u2019t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201d the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. \u201cTrying to get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, home. Where is home?\u201d I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. \u201cIs it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?\u201d There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer\u2026 what? A ride? Shelter? I didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold out here,\u201d I said, stating the obvious. \u201cYou should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.\u201d My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown \u2018No Service\u2019 for the last hour.\n\nThe kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.\n\n\u201cCan you help me?\u201d the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of\u2026 something else. Pleading, maybe?\n\n\u201cYeah, of course, I can help you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?\u201d\n\nThe kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting. At home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026 And where\u2019s home? Which direction?\u201d I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.\n\n\u201cIn there,\u201d the kid said.\n\nMy stomach clenched. \u201cIn the woods? Your home is in the woods?\u201d\n\n\u201cLost,\u201d the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. \u201cTrying to find the path. It\u2019s dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s very dark,\u201d I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026 come out?\u201d the kid asked. \u201cHelp me look? It\u2019s not far. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t see it from here.\u201d\n\nEvery rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this\u2026 strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.\n\nBut the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, buddy,\u201d I said, trying to sound gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We\u2019ll drive until we get a signal, and then we\u2019ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.\u201d\n\nThe kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s right there,\u201d they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. \u201cJust a little way. I can almost see it. If you just\u2026 step out\u2026 the light from your door would help.\u201d\n\nMy skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.\n\nI looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes\u2026 I still couldn\u2019t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.\n\n\u201cI really think you should get in the truck,\u201d I said, my voice firmer now. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.\u201d\n\nThe kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.\n\u201cPlease?\u201d they said. That reedy voice again. \u201cMy leg hurts. I can\u2019t walk much further. If you could just\u2026 help me a little. Just to the path.\u201d\n\nMy internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.\n\nI was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.\n\nI squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they\u2019d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\nIt wasn\u2019t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like\u2026 an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.\n\nThe kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something\u2026 connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?\n\nI leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. \u201cIt\u2019s not far\u2026 please\u2026 just help me\u2026 I\u2019m so cold\u2026\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that\u2026 that thing behind them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a rope. It wasn\u2019t a shadow.\nIt was\u2026 a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.\nIt seemed to emerge directly from the kid\u2019s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn\u2019t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn\u2019t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just\u2026 absorbed it.\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn\u2019t just wrong. This was\u2026 impossible. Unnatural.\n\nThe kid was still trying to coax me. \u201cAre you going to help me? It\u2019s just there. You\u2019re so close.\u201d\n\nMy voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off that\u2026 appendage.\n\u201cKid\u2026 what\u2026 what is that? Behind you?\u201d\n\nThe kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to\u2026 solidify.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 that thing,\u201d I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. \u201cComing out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?\u201d\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t turn to look. They didn\u2019t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing things. You\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\nThey were using my own earlier rationalization against me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I see it. It\u2019s right there. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s connected to you.\u201d\n\nThe kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.\n\nThen, the kid\u2019s face began to change.\nIt wasn\u2019t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn\u2019t leave, but it\u2026 sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.\n\nThe air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.\n\n\u201cJust come out of the truck,\u201d the kid said, and the voice\u2026 oh god, the voice.\nIt wasn\u2019t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.\n\n\u201cCome out. Now.\u201d The command was absolute.\n\nMy hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I\u2019d stupidly left in.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child\u2019s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.\n\nThe kid\u2019s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face \u2013 if you could call it that \u2013 was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.\n\nAnd then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, \u201cthe FUCK are humans smarter now?\u201d\n\nThat was it.\nThat one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t plan. I reacted.\nPrimal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.\nMy hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.\nThe kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression \u2013 that awful, tightened, ancient look \u2013 intensified.\n\nI slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.\nI didn\u2019t look at it. I couldn\u2019t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.\n\nThe truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.\n\nI risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.\nIt was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.\nThe headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.\n\nThe thing didn\u2019t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.\nAnd that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.\n\nI drove.\nI don\u2019t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn\u2019t care.\nThe image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.\n\nI must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I\u2019d ever known.\nMy hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face \u2013 not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.\n\nWhen the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.\nI sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.\n\nBut I knew it wasn\u2019t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don\u2019t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.\n\nI never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? \"Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?\" They\u2019d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.\n\nI finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.\nI told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn\u2019t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.\n\nI found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don\u2019t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I\u2019m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I\u2019ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.\n\nI don\u2019t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn\u2019t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it\u2019s out there. And it\u2019s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.\n\n\"Why the fuck are humans smarter now?\"\n\nThat question haunts me. It implies they weren\u2019t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.\nAnd were never seen again.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can\u2019t explain\u2026 Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being \u201csmarter now\u201d means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what\u2019s asking for help might not be what it seems.\n\nStay safe out there. And for God\u2019s sake, stay on the well-lit roads."},"91":{"title":"He wears my voice pt 1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiniqr\/he_wears_my_voice_pt_1\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"NoxiousSpoon","selftext":"\u201cDaniel, you\u2019re okay.\nYou\u2019re okay.\nPlease\u2014you\u2019re okay.\nThis isn\u2019t you.

I should just\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo.\nWhat am I thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I fucked up, Daniel,\u201d Angel said breaking me free from thought. He was scratching at his arm like he wanted to peel himself open. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. I just\u2026 I really needed it this time. You don\u2019t understand how hard it is.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond. I wasn\u2019t listening. I\u2019d heard it all before.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first relapse. It wouldn\u2019t be the last. Everyone\u2014especially me\u2014was exhausted by his apologies.\n\n\u201cYou need to go before Cindy gets home from school. I don\u2019t want her seeing you like this. Go to Unc\u2019s.\u201d\nI shut the door before he could say another word.\n\nI stood there, still. Processing. I could feel him standing on the other side of the door, too, like his shadow had seeped through the wood. Waiting. Hoping.\n\nEventually, he left. I felt it like a chill lifting.\n\nI\u2019ve always had these thoughts. Sudden, violent things that crash into my brain like a car through glass. Things no normal person should think. Hate that doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs to me\u2026\n\nSometimes I wonder if they come from somewhere else. Either way they\u2019re never pleasant, and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI went back to sit down amid the mess in the living room.  I looked at all the papers scattered about and the broken glass from my new wine cups laying near my coffee table. Red stains covering my new carpet. \n\n\u201cGreat. more work. I\u2019ll have to get this cleaned up quick.\u201d I thought to myself. \n\nCindy would be home in less than an hour. Ever since her mom left us I\u2019ve tried my very best to give her a normal life, something I never had. And it gets increasingly harder when things like this happen. \n\nAn hour later Cindy got home, she walked in cheerfully. \u201cHey dad\u201d she quipped as she threw her bag on the couch and slouched down. \u201c hey sweetie, how was your day\u201d I asked trying to seem normal. \n\n\u201cIt was okay, but like soooo boring. I can\u2019t stand this new teacher. He\u2019s like a goof fr.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat new teacher?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u201cMr Johnson, he\u2019s replacing Ms Steven\u2019s our math teacher.\u201d She said\n\n\u201cWhat happened to her? \u201c\n\n\u201cIdk, quit probably. She was really going through it with the divorce and all\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rough baby\u2014what do you want for dinner? \u201c I asked straying the conversation away from soemthing heavy. \n\n\u201cChicken Alfredooooooo\u201d she sang out with a grin. \n\n\u201cOf course baby\u201d  \nI walked into the kitchen and started cooking. We had a peaceful dinner and went to bed without a hitch. \n\nThe next morning before I could get ready for work I got a call from my uncle. \n\n\u201cDaniel you need to get over here right now.\u201d \n\u201cWhat happe-\u201c\n\n\u201cNOW. You need to come NOW\u201d his voice cracked like something inside him had already broken.\n\nHe hung up and I rushed to my car to drive over since he only lived 3 minutes away. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but not this. definitely not this. \n\nUncle Joe\u2019s front door was cracked open when I arrived. \n\nI pushed it wide and stepped into chaos. Furniture overturned, a lamp shattered on the floor. Glass smothering the middle of the living room. There was blood\u2014just a little\u2014on the tile. A thin red smear on the wall. \n\n\u201cJoe?\u201d I called out.\n\nA grunt answered from the back room.\n\nI found him slumped in his recliner, pale, holding a dish towel to his side. Blood soaked through it.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I rushed to him.\n\n\u201cYour damn brother,\u201d he wheezed, half-laughing, half-wincing. \u201cCame in screaming, tore up the place. I tried to calm him down. He shoved me. I lost my balance and fell into the glass table.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d My fists clenched before I could stop them.\n\nJoe motioned toward the garage. \u201cOut there. Said he needed air. Or to scream. One of the two.\u201d\n\nI made it halfway across the living room when I heard the garage door creak open.\n\nAngel stepped in, shirtless, breathing hard, sweat glistening off his face. His pupils were blown wide.\n\n\u201cDanny,\u201d he smiled. \u201cMan, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come.\u201d He said as if he were greeting me at a bar. \n\n\u201cYou hurt Joe.\u201d I shouted\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s tougher than he looks. You\u2019re mad, I get it. But this\u2014this ain\u2019t all my fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that.\u201d My eyes beaming through him. \n\nHe paced a bit, ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYou know what\u2019s crazy? I came here trying to get clean again. I thought maybe I could fix things. But then he started preaching at me. Talking about Cindy  and Jeffie like they\u2019re some sort of angels. She\u2019s not. He\u2019s not. None of us are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare bring up my daughter.\u201d \n\n\u201cI was just saying,\u201d Angel shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna find out what the world\u2019s really like someday. I mean, you did. Remember what dad used to do when you cried? You remember, right?\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nAngel stepped closer. \u201cI always figured you buried it. But I didn\u2019t. I remembered everything. I just\u2026 handled it differently.\u201d His breath stank of liquor and sin. \n\nI stared at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat neighbor\u2019s kid when I was thirteen\u2014Peter?\u201d His voice was calm now, but slightly slurred. \u201cI did to him what dad did to me. Only once. I swear. But\u2026 it felt like balance. You know? Like I got to put it somewhere. Like it wasn\u2019t just us anymore.\u201d \n\nThe room turned to static.\n\n\u201cI always thought maybe you\u2019d get it one day. That you\u2019d break, like me. Then maybe we\u2019d finally be brothers again.\u201d He said unnervingly \n\nI took a step forward. He didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve left you in that bathroom years ago,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.\n\nThen from behind us: a cough, a weak gasp.\n\nWe turned. Uncle Joe was leaning forward in the recliner, clutching his chest, eyes wide in panic.\n\n\u201cJoe?\u201d I rushed over, dropped to my knees. \u201cUnc? Hey. Look at me.\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth but no sound came out. His lips were blue.\n\nAngel stood behind me, frozen. \u201cHe was just talking ten minutes ago\u2026\u201d he croaked softly\n\nI felt for a pulse. Nothing.\n\n\u201cCall 911!\u201d I snapped.\n\nBut I already knew. His skin was cooling. His eyes were glassy.\n\nHe was gone.\n\nAnd the moment my brain accepted it, the voice came back.\nClearer this time. Not like a thought.\n\nMore like\u2026 a soft whisper in my ear.\n\n\u201cI knew it , I knew it , I knew it. I should just get rid of him. Good for nothing trash. You deserve to suffer. You deserve what dad did to you.  Everywhere you go you ruin everything. You\u2019re poison. Unclean filth. I can\u2019t stand you. I hate you. I hate you so much. You remind me of dad. You deserve what I\u2019m going\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cDo you want to follow the ambulance to the hospital sir? \u201c  an Officer asked me as I stood by in a trance watching EMT load my uncle\u2019s body bag. \n\n\u201cI..uh yes.\u201d I replied \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your loss son. You could probably use these.\u201d The officer said warmly as he handed me a pamphlet full of resources to help with the passing of a loved one. \n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I said emptily. Crumpling the pamphlet. \n\n\nThe next few days were chaotic and melancholic all the same. Angel ran before the cops came, but they caught him the next day. They brought him in for questioning and then let him go from inconclusive evidence. Go figure, this is what passes as justice these days. I had to take over the arrangements for the funeral and informing the rest of the family about it. The funeral came and went as if it was just another day for everyone. I tried to stay grounded as my thoughts were running a thousand miles a minute. Cindy was what kept me from going insane. Her cute reassuring smile could disarm a crazed gunman. \n\nA week went by before I saw Angel again. By that time I sent Cindy to stay with her cousins for a while to get her mind off things. And I had already filed a restraining order against Angel. \n\nHe looked at me with eyes that hadn\u2019t seen sleep as he littered my doorway. \u201cCan you buy me a -\u201c\nI shut the door in his face. I wasn\u2019t in the mood for his bs. I felt his shadow lingering for over an hour after that. Even when I went back out to make sure he was gone. I still felt like he was here. After the second time I looked around I let that feeling dissolve and went on about my day. \n\nMy therapist suggested I try meditation to help deal with the stress. I laid out a mat and sat down and started to meditate. I figured I\u2019d try counting first to keep a steady focus. \n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\nWhat should I make for dinner? \n2 \n3\nMaybe some steak\n4\n\n1\nWhy do I feel like angel is still here? \nNah he left I made sure to check. \nI\u2019ll check again after this.\n2\n3\nDad\n4\n\n1\n2\nWhat?\n3 \n4\n\nWhat about dad? \n1\n2\nDon\u2019t cry you sissy \n\u2026\u2026\nIf you keep crying I\u2019ll give you something to cry about \n3\n4\n\u2026..\n\n\u2026.\n1\nWhy ? Why did he? \nDaddy loves it when you cry\nCry harder \nCRY HARDER \nCRY \n      CRY\n          CRY\n    CRY \n         CRY\n  CRY CRY \nCRY CRY CRY CRY CRY \n2\n3\n4\n\nI felt a stream of tears roll down my right eye. \n\nI kept my eyes closed and kept counting \n\n1\nCindy \n2\n3\nYou\u2019re a disgusting disappointment Danny \nYour mother never loved you\nI never loved you\nNo one will ever love you\n4\n\n1\n2\nStop.\nPlease stop it.\n3\n4\n\nWhy would Anyone love you\nYou\u2019re just like him\n1\nHehehehehehe\n2\nWhat is th\u2014\n\nA long drawn out scratch at my living room window interrupted me. \nI wiped my eye as I glanced at it. Then I noticed my hand. Black liquid. All over my face.\n\n \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \n\nI rushed to my bathroom and Washed it all off. It looked like a bit of it got into my right eye, I might have to go to the doctor. I leaned down to rinse my eye. When I got back up, I froze.\n\nMy reflection was grinning\u2014I wasn\u2019t . \nI checked my face with my hand. I definitely wasn\u2019t. And my reflection hadn\u2019t moved an inch. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Danny ? \u201c\nMy reflection whispered, its eyes grew completely black and void. \n\nI just stared. Unable to move. Unable to speak and my lungs screaming. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time Danny, you\u2019ve waited too long\nWe\u2019ve waited too long.\nDo it. \nDo it Danny . \u201c\n\nhe raised a long jagged blade and his grin grew more wicked. \n\nThud. \n\nI opened my eyes. I was still in the living room. I got up quickly. I dropped the knife in my hand. \n\nThud. Thud. Thud. \n\nI went to the door. Angel, once again. \nBefore the door was fully open he began. \u201c hey man I really need help this time. I\u2019ll go clean I promise.\u201d Words I\u2019ve heard one too many times before. \n\n\u201cDo it Danny.\nDo it \n    Do\n  It\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease Daniel, I promise for real this time.\u201d Angel pleaded to deaf ears. \n\n\n\u201cLiar \u201c\n\u201cDancing with me\u201d\n\nSo lost in thought I tuned Angel out. \nI smiled and said \u201calright man come on in.\u201d \n\nAngel walked in. My grin widened. \n\n\u201cHe deserves it. You know. We know it. \nYou\u2019d be doing him a favor . He can\u2019t live with himself. He\u2019s weak. Too weak. \u201c\n\nNot even 5 minutes went by and Angel was snoring on the couch. \nPassed out from whatever drugs he was on. \n\n\u201cLook at him. Pathetic. \u201c\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll never amount to anything. All he does is bring you trouble. Pain, and sorrow. That\u2019s all he\u2019s good for. \u201c\n\nI gripped the handle tight. I felt it pulsing, like it had a heartbeat of its own. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a burden. A parasite . A roach\u201d\n\nMy thoughts growing louder and louder in my head. Screaming. Begging to escape. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his fault Danny. It\u2019s all his fault. \nHis fault Danny \nAll his fault.\u201d\n\nThe thoughts weren\u2019t just in my head anymore. They were all around me. Inside the walls. Echoing in the vents. \n\n\u201cAll his fault\u201d\n\u201cAll his fault\u201d\n\u201cALL MY FAULT DANNY\u201d\nAngel shrieked suddenly. Sitting bolt upright, his eyes as black as void. \n\nThe knife was stuck too deep by the time I realized what I was doing. \n\nAngel started laughing. Wet and guttural. Like the sound came from his stomach. \n\u201cHehehehehe\u2026.\nIm so proud of you Danny.\u201d\n \nIt wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s voice anymore. Angel sounded like the voice in my head. The voice that\u2019s haunted my thoughts and taken me to darkest corners of humanity. It was its voice. \n\n\nHis mouth kept moving but the voice was booming from every direction. \n\n\u201cDanny \u201c\n\u201cNow I\u2019m free from you.. \u201c\n\nI stumbled back, crashing onto the cold hard floor, breath ragged. I was shirtless. \n\nAngel stood. Grinding his teeth. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon\u201d\n\nand then sprinted straight through a window with inhuman speed. \n\nGlass exploded outward\u2014but I didn\u2019t hear it. \n\nHalf a second later every mirror and window in the house shattered . They cracked like bones all at once. \n\nThe whispers left my head that day, but the wind didn\u2019t carry them far. \n"},"92":{"title":"Me narrating rocket to insanity how did I do please sub to me thanks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kisrl9\/me_narrating_rocket_to_insanity_how_did_i_do\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"Low-Razzmatazz-1051","selftext":"Sub to me please my YouTube is Irvin is ballin https:\/\/youtu.be\/9DquMTmawZU?si=EVd-FWwS9w5cmPNT"},"93":{"title":"I am trapped in a freezer and I can still hear scratching","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiinqv\/i_am_trapped_in_a_freezer_and_i_can_still_hear\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Nox_Cleaver","selftext":"So this is how it ends: bloody, freezing, and alone in the back of a damn pizza shop. I can still hear it scratching, trying to get into my icy resting place, (though the sound is becoming more and more faint). How did all of this start, you might be asking yourself? Well, my buddies and I were driving to a Halloween party when our car broke down on the side of McCarthy Road. McCarthy Road cuts through the backwoods of our town like a scar\u2014long forgotten, barely patrolled, and perfect for drunks who don\u2019t want to be found. Near the end of the road, there is a turnoff into the woods. Every year, the local college kids throw a massive Halloween party there. That\u2019s where we were headed before we got a flat tire.\n\n\n\nIt took nothing for my friend Eric to switch out the tire. His dad is the local mechanic, and he practically lives there. My other buddy's Arin and Roddy were horsing around in the woods, they had already indulged in some booze, they scored some off some poor sucker at the corner store in town. Eric had the tire fixed and got back in the car, but Arin needed to take a leak in the woods, so we all waited.\n\n\n\nAfter 10 minutes had passed, we figured that he either passed out in the woods or was on the verge of getting lost, so we begrudgingly marched out into the woods with our flashlights. That's when we heard him scream.\n\n\n\nWe rushed toward the scream, when the stench hit us\u2014wet earth, rotting meat, and something worse underneath, something old. I could barely keep my eyes open as they began to water.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen we finally caught up to Arin, we saw it: a figure with rotting gray flesh, decayed teeth, and claws sharp as nails. It was crawling out of the rough dirt, gripping Arin\u2019s leg and tearing chunks of flesh from it. We yanked Arin free just as the creature pulled itself from the ground. More of it came into view\u2014its skin hung in strips, slick with decay, and its sickly yellow eyes locked onto us like a predator scenting blood. We ran. Roddy helped Arin, while Eric and I led the way back to the car.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that!\u201d Eric said\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, all I did was piss on the ground and he just popped out.\u201d Arin said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSeems to have pissed it off.\u201d Roddy replied.\n\n\n\nWe made it back to the car and we helped Arin into the back seat we could hear it coming from where we came from. It seemed like it was gaining on us. Eric started the car, and we took off. I saw the sprinting figure burst out of the woods. The look in its eyes gave me a nasty chill in my spine as it ran back into the woods.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid we lose him?\u201d Eric said.\n\n\u201cLooks like it, we gotta get Arin to a hospital.\u201dWe heard what seemed like a gargled roar as we rounded the bend. Out of the shadows, the thing ran in front of our car.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHoly Shi-\u201d Arin screamed.\n\n\n\nThe impact launched Arin forward, glass flying around him like shrapnel. What followed was quick, brutal, and final. The car ended up in a ditch on the side of the road. As we all hobbled out of the scrap heap,\u00a0 we all saw the thing crawl up from where the hood of the car would have been. We took off down the road, passing Arin's eviscerated corpse on the ground. The thing started to hobble towards us, slowly picking up speed as the woods passed around us. You know how they say you don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the guy next to you? Well, that\u2019s what happened. Roddy happened to be the slowest of us, and that's what did him in. The next thing Eric and I heard was the noise of ripping flesh and Roddy\u2019s scream. Our legs carried out on that deviled street until we finally reached town. We darted down Deerborne Drive to the Sheriff's office.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSheriff Barkley was watching the TV, legs resting up on a chair. He barely noticed Eric and I crashing through the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cSheriff! You have to help us, there is like something out there, it murdered Roddy!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe leaned in towards us without ungluing his eyes from the Tv.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat's that boy\u2019s? Night going ok?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Did you even hear us, our friends are dead!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWoah, ok calm down.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarkley shut off the Tv and stood up.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this thing came from, but it killed Arin, Roddy and totaled my car!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSheriff Barkley tightened his holster on his hip\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me your friends are dead and it wasn\u2019t a damn deer? Son, don\u2019t screw with me tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn that instance we heard it, the bloodcurdling growl we heard from the woods. It was here.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a thundering crash the Ghoul had busted the Sheriff's front door.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt began lumbering towards us, faster and faster. That's when I heard the bang from Barkleys gun, but it was too late for him, the thing latched onto him, tearing chunks of flesh off of his neck consuming his face. His screams drowned through the whole station as me and Eric bolted out the front door.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe went from Deerborne, to Devalue Road, to Main Street and ended in the downtown area of our town. Eric smashed through the back door of Tony\u2019s Pizza, and we stumbled into the cold, fluorescent-lit kitchen.\n\nWe barricaded the doors with tables, chairs, and anything we could drag across the floor. The pizza shop was pitch dark, save for the flickering neon \"OPEN\" sign buzzing in the front window. Eric kept watch near the counter, peeking through the blinds while I sat slumped in the corner, bleeding, shaking, trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my arm where I\u2019d taken a hit during our escape\u2014might\u2019ve been glass, might\u2019ve been claws, I didn\u2019t look close enough.\n\nFor a while, it was quiet. That kind of quiet where even your breathing sounds too loud. We thought maybe we\u2019d finally lost it, that maybe the thing gave up once we got into town. Monsters don\u2019t like streetlights and sidewalks, right? That\u2019s what we told ourselves.\n\nBut then, just after midnight, we heard the front glass shatter. One clean, sharp crack, like a lightbulb exploding right in your ear. That same low, wet growl echoed from the dining area\u2014closer this time, like it had been waiting. Watching. Toying with us.\n\nEric whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d like he couldn\u2019t believe it, like naming it would make it more real. He grabbed a pizza pan like it would actually do something, told me to run for the back while he tried to slow it down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, man,\u201d I said, already choking on fear.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nHe shoved me, hard, and I bolted. I heard metal crash behind me, the sound of claws scraping against tile, tables flipping, something being thrown. Then Eric screamed.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget that scream. Not as long as I live\u2014which, depending on how this ends, might not be long at all.\n\nI made it to the back, slipping on what I thought was spilled sauce\u2014until I saw the smear of red and the shredded apron lying next to it. I don\u2019t know who it belonged to. Don\u2019t want to. I saw the freezer door, hanging slightly open like an invitation to hell or salvation\u2014I couldn\u2019t tell which. I yanked it wide, ducked inside, and slammed it shut behind me. The lock clicked automatically.\n\nThen... silence. Or almost silence.\n\nThat\u2019s when the scratching started. First soft, then more insistent. Nails, claws, whatever they were, dragging against the metal like it was trying to remember how doors worked. Like it was testing the edges. Like it knew I was in here.\n\nSo here I am. Lying all bloody inside the local pizza shop\u2019s walk-in freezer. I can still hear it scratching, trying to get into my icy resting place\u2014although it\u2019s becoming more and more faint. Maybe it\u2019s losing interest. Maybe the cold is slowing it down. Or maybe it\u2019s just waiting me out. That thing doesn\u2019t feel hunger or fear or cold\u2014it just... is. A walking corpse with rage in its bones. And it wants me next.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer I can stay awake. My fingers are numb. My breath fogs with every exhale. I keep thinking about Roddy and Arin. About Eric. About how fast it all unraveled. One moment we were just dumb kids on the way to a Halloween party. The next... we were running for our lives from something that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd if you're reading this\u2014if someone actually finds this messed-up tale written on a dead guy\u2019s phone\u2014please believe me. Don\u2019t write me off as some drunk college burnout. Don\u2019t say we imagined it. The Ghoul is real. And it\u2019s out there.\n\nDon\u2019t go near McCarthy Road. Don\u2019t piss in the woods. And for the love of God, don\u2019t ignore the smell of rot.\n\nMe? I\u2019m just hoping the cold is enough to hide me. Or kill me before it finds a way in.\n\nEither way... this freezer might be the only thing between me and becoming what I saw in those woods.\n\nThe Ghoul took my friends. It took my town. And if that scratching gets louder again... it\u2019ll take me too.\n\n"},"94":{"title":"I Shouldn't Have Taken That Shot | Narration","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kipcwh\/i_shouldnt_have_taken_that_shot_narration\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"TheCryptomythologist","selftext":"[https:\/\/youtu.be\/dWdfgtC62zo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dWdfgtC62zo)\n\nOriginal Author- u\/Pentyworth223"},"95":{"title":"THE-DEATH-CODE-ARCHIVES","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiitpv\/thedeathcodearchives\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Firm_Ad_2498","selftext":"# THE DEATH CODE ARCHIVES\n\n**Written by Joash Jude Pillay**\n\n# Genesis (????-1990)\n\nAt the beginning of time an\u00a0**alien**\u00a0race was born.

After he finished the first level as Xario, a shooting star crashed into the ground as seen in the background.**\n\n**Marcus continued to play the game, but his head started to ache. The red and black graphics did not help. Marcus continued to play the game as he noticed multiple glitches, the game was so close to his concept art including ghosts and great level design, but it fell apart with these glitches.**\n\n**Marcus reaches the end of the game only to find that shooting star from the first level.

For decades, residents reported strange lights flying over the fields, animals disappearing without a trace, and a metallic smell in the air after rain. But no one dared to approach the place.\n\nOn a rainy night, three young people \u2014 Matheus, Lorena and Diego \u2014 decided to invade the resort to record a video and gain followers. The rusty gate opened with a metallic scream. The smell of oxidized iron and putrid flesh was almost unbearable. Upon entering the old barn, they found symbols carved in circles on the floor and a staircase that led to an underground cellar.\n\nDown below, the air was colder. The floor was covered in a dark, viscous substance. In the center of the basement, an altar made of bones \u2014 human and animal \u2014 was lit by a greenish glow that had no apparent source. When Lorena touched the altar, everyone heard a dry crack, like flesh tearing. The back wall slowly opened, revealing bodies hanging from metal wires emerging from their skulls, their eye sockets sewn shut with what looked like sinew.\n\nFrom the dark, tall creatures emerged, with black eyes and translucent skin that showed the pulsation of their internal organs. They didn't speak, they just made a high-pitched sound that made your bones vibrate. One by one, the young men were immobilized by an invisible force. Matheus was the first: his skin was opened like a zipper and removed in one piece, revealing pulsing muscles while he was still screaming. Lorena had her brain removed by a precise cut on the back of her head, while her eyes moved in despair. Diego tried to run away, but fell to his knees when he saw his own reflection in the eyes of one of the creatures \u2014 his face was already being peeled off, slowly, without pain, just horror.\n\nThe next day, the bodies were found on the side of the road, sewn together in a grotesque way: the eyes of one inside the mouth of another, the skin stretched like a cloak, and inscriptions in an alien language burned into their bones.\n\nSince then, Pedra Branca has been isolated. The city's radio signals now transmit only static interspersed with voices whispering human names. Estancia do C\u00e9u has been sealed off with concrete, but residents still say they hear banging sounds coming from beneath the ground... as if something is digging... to get out.\n"},"97":{"title":"This Thing STALKS the Old McDonald's Drive Thru and it's PlayPlace at Night, If You See It.......RUN!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kin7ho\/this_thing_stalks_the_old_mcdonalds_drive_thru\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Slight-Midnight-5926","selftext":"I knew my life would be shit once I started working at McDonald's. I started working at McD's when I realized my mom had stopped wanting to pay my college funds. I needed to pay my rent, There was a small town on the way to my parents\u2019 house just off the highway. Armonica was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasn\u2019t a gas station or rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close. Let\u2019s just say I had to sneak my way around some very old job applications there to discover that they had one of the few McDonald\u2019s (aside from some local supermarkets and a small post office) that had yet to go through a exterior remodel since the 1970's and an interior remodel since the 1990's. I was surprised they even had a McDonald's, yet they didn\u2019t have a Wendy's, Taco Bell, KFC, Burger King, Popeyes Chicken or any other restaraunt (aside from local ones).\n\nI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town none of the houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. I\u2019d be surprised if most of the residents hadn\u2019t moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town, I ended up working there, anyway, and impressed the manager enough to have a suitable income for my situation. Finally, I had enough money to pay my rent, and support myself. Things were good, but I was still looking for other jobs that related to my studies over at college. We had a small staff, consisting of only twelve people. After about a year, I was granted the job of assistant manager. One quiet night, we were ready to work all night (we were working all night because of McDonald's new 24 hour drive-thru system). My shift was all the way from 10:00 to 8:00 in the morning. I thought it would be a slow, boring night, with nothing more than me, and another nine people. The nine people were an old man named John, a middle-aged woman named Kam, a middle-aged man named Frederick, an old woman named Julie, and the rest were a few boys and girls in their late teens and early to late twenties. I was the supervisor for the night, and my boss decided to leave us.\n\nMost of the night, there were no customers to speak of. Well, except for this one guy. He was pretty fat and I guessed that there were some people who wanted their Big Mac fix at 12 at night. After 12, all of us just stood at our posts, sometimes talking, sometimes not. I just looked at the drive thru camera most of the time, looking for something that caught my eye. I did notice a car coming in from the drive thru entrance.\n\n\"Gear up, guys,\" I told them, \"there's a customer.\"\n\nThe car was a yellow-ish 1950's Ford Thunderbird.\n\n\"And he's got a sweet car,\" I said to make things more interesting.\n\nI picked up the headset, and spoke into the mic:\n\n\"Hello, welcome to McDonald's. May I take your order?\"\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, I heard a whispering, or a quiet speaking of some sort. This was a bit weird, and I just asked again.\n\n\"Sorry sir, could you just repeat that order again?\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence, I just regarded the whole situation as odd. I looked over to my co-workers and shrugged. I could tell that John was getting impatient. I asked again:\n\n\"Could you give me that order again, please?\"\n\nThere was silence again. Before I could ask again, John took the headset from me.\n\n\"Sir, could you\u00a0*please*\u00a0just-\"\n\nHe was cut off by something. By what, I don't know. The colour faded away from his face immediately. He ripped off the headset and ran to the employee wash room, crying. I was shocked that such a senile old man could break so easily. One of the girls chased him. I put on the headset and heard static. I saw that the cord was cut.\n\n\"God dammit, John you broke the headset!\"\n\nI looked at the screens, and neither of them had the yellow convertible. Fifteen minutes later, one of the 26-year old males came back with John.\n\n\"He said he heard his mother's voice.\"\n\nI didn't know whether to yell at him to stop being so crazy, or sympathize with him. I just told him to get back to work, and that I'd take care of the drive thru. The 16-29 yr old girls were clearly looking worried, and a bit scared. As an assistant manager, I had to keep all of my staff under control, and working. I told them just to get back to their posts and wait for me to give them any orders that came through. Earlier on, I had no idea as to what happened. I was thinking of ways that this could be possible.\u00a0*Were we being pranked?*\u00a0I thought, as I looked through the cameras once more.\u00a0*Had they just messed with us on the mic, and sped right past the window?*\u00a0*No, they couldn't have. I would have heard the engine right outside*. I wasn't a skeptic in earlier parts of my life, but recently, I had stopped believing in such things. I didn't know whether I was losing touch with my religion, or maybe my lack of belief in the supernatural. Needless to say, I had a lesser amount of logic in my mind than before tonight.\n\nIt was about an hour later that some weird things started going on. We were all a little tired, and we were all about to take mini-shifts where we would all take quick naps. I looked down at the cameras once more and noticed a bit of fuzz going on. I tapped the screen lightly, and that seemed to fix it for a couple seconds. It started to get a bit more fuzzy than before after I tried to fix it again. After a few more times of 'fixing' it, I noticed something really peculiar going on in the top-right corner of the screen. There was some guy who appeared to be dressed up as Ronald McDonald walking down the side walk that was just barely out of view. After the clown guy had passed, there was another guy also dressed as Ronald McDonald just seconds afterwards.\n\n\"Hey guys, check this out.\"\n\nI said, pointing to the screen. Once I had said that, the guy stopped, and looked over to the camera. I felt like he heard me somehow. He then continued to walk and then there was no more of the hoodie guy.\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\nThe screen started to clear up again. By that time, I had really started to get tired. I would have taken a nap, but for some reason there's a rule about the manager, supervisor or assistant manager not taking naps, and knowing John, he'd rat me out in a second. So, I went to the office that was in the back, and just did some paperwork that needed to get taken care of. I just needed to fill out what was used in the night, how much we made. It's actually very simple stuff. While I was working on the papers, I noticed this red piece of the paper that was in the pile. I picked it out, and read it. It said:\n\n**\"THE PLAY PLACE BALLPIT\"**\n\nOf course, I could understand it, but the writing was very sloppy, and reminded me a bit of the name of a horror movie about a fast food restaurants play area. I chuckled a bit and went to consult my co-workers. I asked them if they had left the piece of paper in the office, but all they said in return was:\n\n\"The office had been locked all day and we're too tired to pull any pranks.\"\n\nI just left it in the office and went to check on the cameras.\n\nI got to the cameras only to find them busted. All the screens were cracked, and the headset was emitting this weird static noise.\n\n\"Guys! Who the fuck did this?\" I questioned in an extremely angry tone.\n\n\"I thought I heard something,\" said one of the males.\n\n\"What did you hear?\"\n\nHe seemed to have a higher I.Q than the other boys or girls, who just seemed to text on their phones half the day, so I was surprised to see that he didn't check the noise.\n\n\"I heard a bit of tapping and then a loud banging sound. It only lasted for a couple seconds, so I thought someone else was over there.\"\n\n\"I thought you were over there\" said one of the girls, texting on her phone.\n\nWhy their phones have so much power, I'll never understand.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't,\" I said in a shaky voice.\n\nFor the next few minutes, we just stood there, not talking. It was kind of eerie, actually. It was all silent, and I could hear nothing except the static of the headset-\u00a0*The headset*\u00a0I thought, realizing the chord had been broken earlier. I ran over to the headset, checking to see if my theory was going anywhere. Sure enough, I was correct. The chord was completely disconnected, but it was still making noise. I felt my blood run cold, and the hairs on my neck stand up as I slowly put on the headset. All I heard was a disarray of static, and I didn't even know what to say, so I stammered out a weak \"Hello?\"\n\nAs soon as I spoke, the headset blared out a loud and disoriented:\n\n\"**THE-B-B-BALLPIT**\" followed by an eerie, long chuckle\n\nIt was so loud that I ripped off the headset as soon as I heard it. After that, I told them not to go anywhere outside the restaraunt or in the play area.\n\nAs the night went on, I tried to get the screens fixed, but I couldn't so I just told the employees to watch the windows every once in a while. It started to get a little hot, which was strange since it was in the middle of October. All I knew, it was always very cool during the night. I regarded it as just a change in temperature. The night went on, silently, and eerily. I made some hourly rounds, and it was nearly 4 in the morning when I noticed Kam and Julie and one of the boys had gone missing.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked Frederick, since he and John know a lot about what's happening, more than me and everybody else.\n\n\"How am I supposed to know?\" he snapped back, snarling a bit as he did so.\n\n\"Aren't you supposed to keep track of them? I ain't no babysitter. I'm just doing my job.\"\n\nHe was right. This could badly effect my performance, and ruin the stable relationship I have with my manager. I looked in the back, and saw that all of their stuff was gone.\u00a0*Where could they have gone?*\u00a0I thought as I opened her locker. Her phone was still here, so she couldn't have gone far. I went over to the screens and tried to fix them again, to see if I could make some more progress. About an hour later, I finally fixed the screens. By this time, I was sweating like a dog in the desert. It was so hot, that the air was almost like warm blankets. I looked at the screens, and all of them were this dark shade of red.\n\n\"Oh shit.\" I said to myself, as I saw the headless bodies of several teenagers in the bottom-left corner of the camera's view all drenched in a black, bubbling and oozing liquid.\n\nI ran to the window and tried to open it, but as soon as i did, it suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.\n\nBehind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were now burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots. Things were starting to get really eerie down here,\n\nI quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit.\n\nA cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the dead bodies outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.\n\nThe same voice that warned us about a ball pit tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed the headsets were now broken just like the rest of this dump now. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and the heat. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.\n\nI ran back to the window and tried to open it. It wouldn't budge. In fact, none of the windows would open. I ran to the back door, and tried to open it.\u00a0*I have to get out of here*\u00a0I thought, as I tried to bust the door down. It would not open, no matter how hard I tried. By now, I was feeling weak, and I noticed that no one else was around except for me. I looked out of the drive thru window at an angle so I could see what exactly happened. It looked like someone had ran them over with a tractor. Blood and the black liquid was everywhere and it looked like some of her entrails were splattered along the wall. I threw up at the sight.\n\nI rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the person\u2019s arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor.\n\nThey were wearing a McDonalds\u2019 employee shirt with a name-tag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the voice was getting louder, the tones fizzling and distorting as they repeated.\n\nOnce I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze.\n\nSince entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place as i had mentioned.\n\nThe glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody hand-prints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with employees wearing the same #### name-tags hanging from them and the same look on their faces and eyes. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls\u2019 mouths. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move.\n\nWhile the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making an awful burning plastic smell.\n\nThe balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped.\n\nA yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long.\n\nIt finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.\n\nI broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I ran to the right of the restaurant, and tried to exit through the glass doors that led inside. I looked for something to break open the windows. I wanted to break out of here so badly, but at the same time, I wanted to be cold. I was getting so tired of the blistering heat.\n\nI went over behind the counter and disconnected the cash register. I threw it at the glass, but the glass seemed to reflect it back at me. It nearly hit me in the knee.  I heard something making a hissing noise behind me. It was the grill, it was hissing, and the grease traps were smoking. The grill suddenly burst into flames, which made the heat unbearable.\n\nI broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. The roof had been set on fire just as I got to the exit.\n\nAs I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the voice warning us about the ballpit\n\n**\u201cCome back. I want to see you smile.\u201d**\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying several buildings and businesses in Armonica burned to the ground a few days later. I don\u2019t know if it was a cover up or something else, but I\u2019m never going back to find out.\n\nI didn\u2019t share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you work at an old McDonald's with a ballpit.\n\nYou can go to a new McDonald\u2019s, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, that\u2019s fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now.  \nBut don\u2019t ever go into an old McDonald\u2019s. Not even the drive thru or the playplace.\n\nI\u2019ve got to stop typing now and get some pain meds.\n\nMy jaw hurts and the hand I snapped in that register has been getting itchy"},"98":{"title":"VERY Creepy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kihj6w\/very_creepy\/","flair":"Video","author":"MagicJigPipe","selftext":"Check it out before it gets disappeared\u2026.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/jhdFPgBB2v8?si=7cE46BWzh0RvX8R3"},"99":{"title":"creepypasta podcasts?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kilgpv\/creepypasta_podcasts\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"First_Blood_6986","selftext":"i listened to this podcast called the magnus archives where basically each episode is it\u2019s one horror story but it has an over arching narrative through the entire 200 episodes. does anyone know of anything like that or just aby good horror podcasts. my favorite part of creepypasta horror is cryptids like skinwalkers and the wendigo "},"192":{"title":"The racists want the immigrants out","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kikkg2\/the_racists_want_the_immigrants_out\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"All the racists want the immigrants out and they are chanting racist rhetoric and marching down the road, it's all been done before. It always happens when the economy goes down or if there is a war going on. History repeats itself and right now we have a couple of wars and the economy is bad, and so the public want the immigrants out. They want all of the immigrants out apart from a guy called gitan who makes such lovely kebabs. So on the streets the racists are chanting \"kick out the immigrants apart from gitan because he makes such lovely kebabs!\" \n\nSo I went to gitan the lovely kebab maker and I killed him, and I stole his image. As I stole gitans image this act would kill him and turn him into ash. Now everyone will think that I am gitan, and I got the hang of being a kebab shop owner very quickly. Everybody loved me and the racists loved me, and I was no longer scared when the racists protested on the streets. I felt safe and secure and I have been through a few times of racial hatred, life is like a swing and you have your ups and downs. \n\nThen the racists started to chant \"we want all the immigrants apart from gitan and murad!\" And murad was a very well known local shop keeper. So now these racists didn't mind 2 people living in their country. So I split myself into 2, and the second version of me went to murad and changed into looking exactly like murad. This act had killed the real Murad. So now I was both gitan and Murad and this took a lot of energy. At least I didn't have to be scared of the racists anymore who chanted down the road about how they wanted the immigrants to be removed. \n\nThen the racists did more protests and as times got harder, the more harsher the racists had become. They now chanted \"we want all the immigrants to be kicked out apart from gitan, Murad, and hardeen!\" And so I had to split myself again. My third split looked for hardeen and killed him by looking like him. I was always so tired but I needed to make sure I was only the immigrants that racists didn't mind staying in their country. \n\nRacism comes and goes and it's usually during hard times.

An abandoned animatronic factory loomed ahead, its rusted sign barely legible: \"Whimsical Wonders Inc.\" Once a beacon of joy, now it stood as a mausoleum of childhood nightmares. The air was thick with the scent of decay and rust, and the silence was punctuated only by the soft crunch of gravel underfoot.\n\n\n\nEli had always been drawn to the allure of the abandoned, the thrill of uncovering secrets hidden beneath layers of dust and time. His friends often warned him about the dangers of such places, but the thrill of exploration outweighed their concerns. Today, he felt an electric excitement coursing through him; this factory was rumored to be filled with the most bizarre and unsettling animatronics ever created.\n\n\n\nAs he stepped inside, the door creaked ominously, echoing through the cavernous space. Shadows danced along the walls, and the dim light from his flashlight flickered as if reluctant to illuminate the horrors waiting within. The factory was a labyrinth of conveyor belts, broken machinery, and towering shelves filled with disassembled parts. A chill ran down Eli's spine as he took in the sight of hundreds of animatronics, their lifeless eyes staring blankly into the void.\n\n\n\nEach figure was more grotesque than the last. Clowns with painted smiles that seemed to mock him, animals with exaggerated features that twisted into grotesque shapes, and humanoid figures with skin that appeared too taut, too shiny. He felt as if they were all watching him, their silent judgment weighing heavily on his shoulders. Eli shook off the unease and ventured deeper into the factory, driven by an insatiable curiosity.\n\n\n\nAs he wandered through the dimly lit aisles, Eli's flashlight beam fell upon a large animatronic bear, its once-vibrant fur now matted and stained. It was posed mid-dance, frozen in a grotesque pirouette. He reached out to touch it, but a sudden noise\u2014a soft whirring\u2014made him recoil. The sound seemed to come from the depths of the factory, a mechanical heartbeat echoing through the hollow space.\n\n\n\n\"Just the machinery,\" he muttered to himself, though doubt gnawed at the edges of his mind. He pressed on, the whirring growing louder, almost rhythmic, as if something was waking up.\n\n\n\nHe stumbled upon a room filled with half-assembled animatronics, their limbs strewn about like discarded toys. In the center stood a towering figure\u2014a jester with a wide, sinister grin and eyes that seemed to follow him. Eli felt a shiver run down his spine as he backed away slowly, but the jester\u2019s grin widened, as if it had come to life at his fear.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the whirring stopped, replaced by a low, guttural hum that resonated through the factory. Eli's heart raced as he turned to leave, but the door behind him slammed shut with a deafening bang. Panic surged through him, and he frantically searched for another way out.\n\n\n\nAs he ran through the aisles, the animatronics seemed to shift in the shadows, their positions altering as if they were alive. He swore he saw the jester\u2019s head tilt, its eyes narrowing as it watched him. Eli's breathing grew erratic, and he could feel the oppressive weight of the factory closing in around him.\n\n\n\nHe stumbled into a large assembly room, where the walls were lined with monitors, each flickering to life with static. Eli's breath caught in his throat as he saw himself reflected back in the screens, surrounded by the animatronics. But the reflections were distorted, twisted versions of himself, grinning maniacally. He turned to escape, but the door he had entered from was gone, replaced by a wall of cold steel.\n\n\n\nDesperation clawed at him as he darted toward a window, but it was sealed tight. The air grew thick with a metallic scent, and he could hear the faint sound of laughter echoing through the room\u2014a chilling, childlike giggle that sent icy tendrils of fear down his spine.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the animatronics began to stir. The jester stepped forward, its limbs moving with an unnatural grace. Eli backed away, his heart pounding in his chest as the other figures followed suit, their eyes glowing with a sinister light. The factory was alive, and it hungered for him.\n\n\n\nEli turned to run, but the animatronics closed in, their laughter ringing in his ears. He dashed through the maze of machines, the whirring sound returning, now a cacophony of grinding gears and echoing voices. He could feel their cold hands reaching for him, their laughter growing louder, drowning out his screams.\n\n\n\nJust when he thought he would be consumed by the darkness, Eli spotted a flicker of light\u2014a small door at the far end of the room. He sprinted toward it, adrenaline propelling him forward. The jester was right behind him, its laughter a haunting melody that echoed through the factory.\n\n\n\nEli burst through the door and tumbled into the night, gasping for air. He glanced back, expecting to see the animatronics spilling out after him, but the door slammed shut, sealing the horrors within. He stumbled away from the factory, his heart racing, and the laughter still ringing in his ears.\n\n\n\nAs he reached the edge of the property, he turned to look back at the factory. The windows glowed faintly, and for a moment, he thought he saw the jester standing in the window, grinning at him, its eyes gleaming with malice.\n\n\n\nEli never returned to the factory, but the echoes of steel and shadows haunted him. The laughter lingered in his mind, a reminder that some places are better left undisturbed, and some toys should never be played with. The animatronics remained, waiting for the next curious soul to wander into their grasp, their eyes forever watching, forever hungry."},"194":{"title":"The Forgotten Stream","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kijww0\/the_forgotten_stream\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"It was a rainy Saturday evening when I found myself scrolling through the endless abyss of YouTube, seeking comfort in the familiar voice of my favorite YouTuber, Markiplier. His videos had been a part of my life for years, a source of laughter, excitement, and a sense of community. But that night, as the rain drummed against the window and the wind howled through the trees, I stumbled upon something I had never seen before: an old Markiplier video titled \u201cThe Last Stream.\u201d\n\n\n\nCuriosity piqued, I clicked on the thumbnail. The video was grainy, a stark contrast to the high-definition content Markiplier usually produced. The screen flickered, and the familiar face of Mark appeared, but his expression was different\u2014serious, almost haunted. He sat in a dimly lit room, the shadows dancing ominously around him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d he said, his voice low and gravelly. \u201cThis is a special stream, and I hope you\u2019re ready for something different.\u201d He smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cTonight, we\u2019re going to explore the darker side of gaming.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs the video progressed, Mark introduced a game I had never heard of\u2014\u201cThe Abyss.\u201d He explained that it was an indie horror game known for its psychological twists and deeply unsettling atmosphere. His tone was more somber than usual, and I felt an unease creeping in.\n\n\n\nThe game started, and I watched as Mark navigated through a dark, pixelated world filled with grotesque creatures and whispers that seemed to echo from the screen. The ambiance was chilling, the kind of dread that crawls under your skin. I leaned closer, my heart racing with each jump scare, but what unsettled me the most was Mark\u2019s increasing discomfort. He would pause, look around the room, and then shake his head as if trying to clear his mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the game, right?\u201d he said, forcing a laugh, but it sounded hollow. I could see beads of sweat forming on his forehead, and a flicker of something\u2014fear?\u2014crossed his face.\n\n\n\nThe stream continued, and as Mark delved deeper into the game, strange things began to happen. The chat was filled with bizarre comments\u2014\u201cTurn back,\u201d \u201cIt knows you\u2019re there,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t trust it.\u201d At first, I thought it was just a joke, part of the game\u2019s creepy atmosphere. But then Mark\u2019s face changed. He looked directly into the camera, a look of terror etched across his features.\n\n\n\n\u201cGuys, something\u2019s not right,\u201d he said, his voice trembling. \u201cI think\u2026 I think the game is reacting to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe screen flickered again, and the shadows behind him seemed to stretch, as if reaching for him. I felt a chill run down my spine. My heart raced as I realized I was no longer just watching a video; I was part of something much darker.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the stream cut to static, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. My phone buzzed with a notification\u2014an alert from the channel. \u201cNew video uploaded.\u201d I hesitated but clicked on it. The thumbnail was black, with the title \u201cThe Abyss: Aftermath.\u201d\n\n\n\nI watched in horror as the new video began. It showed Mark\u2019s face, pale and gaunt, his eyes sunken. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, his voice barely audible. \u201cI thought I could handle it. I thought it was just a game.\u201d He looked over his shoulder, and I could see the fear in his eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s real. It\u2019s always been real.\u201d\n\n\n\nI felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as I typed in the chat, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The response was immediate, a flood of messages\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s coming for you,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re next,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let it in.\u201d My heart raced as I glanced around my dimly lit room, feeling the air grow thick with dread.\n\n\n\nMark continued to speak, his voice breaking. \u201cI tried to warn you all, but now it\u2019s too late. If you\u2019re watching this, it knows you.\u201d The screen flickered again, and I could hear a low, guttural growl emanating from the speakers. My pulse quickened as I turned up the volume, trying to decipher the sounds.\n\n\n\nAnd then I saw it\u2014a shadow creeping behind him, a dark figure that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. Mark\u2019s eyes widened in terror as he turned to face it, and the last thing I heard was a blood-curdling scream before the screen went black.\n\n\n\nThe silence was deafening. I sat frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. I was alone, but I felt an overwhelming sense of dread, as if something was watching me from the corners of my room. My phone buzzed again, and I reluctantly picked it up. A message from an unknown number flashed on the screen: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have watched.\u201d\n\n\n\nI jumped, my heart racing as I scanned the room. The shadows seemed to shift and twist, and I felt a cold breeze brush against my skin. I quickly shut off my phone, but the darkness felt oppressive, suffocating. I tried to convince myself it was just a game, just a video, but deep down, I knew it was more than that.\n\n\n\nThe night dragged on, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak of the house sent chills down my spine. I turned on all the lights, but the shadows only grew darker, more menacing. I tried to distract myself with other videos, but Mark\u2019s haunted face lingered in my mind, his desperate warning echoing in my ears.\n\n\n\nHours passed, and I finally decided to go to bed, hoping sleep would chase away the unease that clung to me. As I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling, the darkness pressing in around me. Just as I began to drift off, I heard it\u2014a faint whisper, barely audible but unmistakable.\n\n\n\n\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nI bolted upright, my heart racing. The voice was soft but filled with desperation. I glanced around the room, my breath coming in quick gasps. \u201cIs someone there?\u201d I called out, but the only response was silence.\n\n\n\nThen, my phone buzzed again. I grabbed it, my hands shaking as I opened the notification. Another video had been uploaded\u2014\u201cThe Abyss: You Are Next.\u201d My stomach dropped as I clicked on it, dread pooling in my gut.\n\n\n\nMark appeared on the screen, but this time he was different. His eyes were wide, filled with an unspeakable terror. \u201cIt\u2019s coming for you,\u201d he said, his voice trembling. \u201cYou need to get out. Get out now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe screen flickered, and the shadow loomed behind him once more, growing larger, more defined. I could see its features now\u2014twisted and grotesque, with hollow eyes that seemed to stare directly at me through the screen. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead.\n\n\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Mark screamed, but before I could react, the screen went black again, and my phone died, plunging me into darkness.\n\n\n\nPanic surged through me as I fumbled for the light switch, my heart pounding in my chest. The shadows around me seemed to pulse with life, and I could feel something lurking just beyond the edge of my vision. I was trapped, ensnared in a web of terror that I couldn\u2019t escape.\n\n\n\nAnd then I heard it again, the whisper, now louder and more insistent. \u201cHelp me\u2026 help me\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nI stumbled out of bed, my mind racing. I had to get out of the house. I grabbed my jacket and rushed for the door, but as I reached for the handle, it wouldn\u2019t budge. Panic set in as I pulled harder, but it felt like something was holding it shut.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me out!\u201d I screamed, my voice echoing in the silence. The whisper grew louder, more frantic, and I could feel the presence behind me, pressing closer. I turned around, my breath hitching in my throat as I saw the shadow looming in the corner of the room, its hollow eyes fixed on me.\n\n\n\n\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201d it rasped, its voice a chilling echo of Mark\u2019s. I stumbled back, my heart racing as I realized I was trapped, ensnared in the very nightmare I had watched unfold on the screen.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, I understood the truth. The game was real, and I had unwittingly opened a door I could never close. The darkness surged forward, engulfing me, and I felt a cold grip wrap around my throat as I was pulled into the abyss.\n\n\n\nThe last thing I heard before everything went black was a familiar voice, echoing through the void. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have watched.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then there was silence."},"195":{"title":"Thirst","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kijfh1\/thirst\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"No-Revolution-5923","selftext":"No stream runs through. No lake nearby. Just the well. It\u2019s the oldest thing here. Older than the sagging timbers of the feasting hall, older even than the oldest stories Gran Fenner tells by the fire. Older than all of it, save perhaps for Lifflin, our Dryad, silent within the Heartwood of her great tree. She\u2019s older still, I\u2019m sure. The well itself is sunk right in the center of everything, its wide, square mouth opening to the sky. Broad stone slabs line its sides, each one set below the last, narrowing as they descend. Step by step, down into the earth\u2019s cool belly. Damp, even at high bloom, but never, ever muddy. Its stone is worn smooth, dipped a little in the middle where countless soles have trod. Even on a moonless night, you can find your way down and up again without a torch, your feet remembering each familiar edge and hollow.\n\n\n\nThe hot spring steams near the edge of our clearing. Not the kind of water that quenches thirst, but a gift for the craft Father\u2019s been teaching me. I spend most days there now, the heat a familiar prickle on my skin, learning the rhythm of it. Selecting the best Sagewood, straight-grained and true, feeling the moment the salt has bitten deep enough, transforming the pale wood into something dark, hard as flint but lighter, less likely to shatter against stone or bone. Spring-hardened, we call it. It\u2019s not as simple as it sounds.\n\n\n\nFather promised me my own spear this passing, balanced for my hand, its point honed sharp enough to draw blood from a shadow. Said I was ready for the hunt Lifflin permits each moon \u2013 one careful hunt, just enough to keep fat on our bones without souring the forest\u2019s mood. The thought of it, walking tall with the hunters, my spear whispering in my grip\u2026 it\u2019s been a fire in my chest for seasons.\n\n\n\nBut the fire banked low when Father came back from the elders\u2019 council, his brow tight. We had to harden spears for the younger boys too. Bran, who still flinches when the wind rattles the thatch, would get one. It wasn\u2019t fair. I\u2019d waited, learned the patience of the steam, the feel of the wood yielding its softness. Why the rush? \u201cNerves, lad,\u201d Father grunted, not meeting my eye. \u201cEveryone\u2019s jumpy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. The unease had been creeping in like mist for a passing, maybe more. Since the blackbirds arrived. Not just a scattering, but a flock, their feathers drinking the light, their eyes like chips of obsidian watching everything. Always watching. From the hut roofs, from the fence posts, from the highest branches of Lifflin\u2019s own tree. Their cawing scrapes at the quiet, sharp and incessant. Try to chase one, they just hop aside, mocking. Throw a stone, they melt into the air, gone before your arm is halfway through the swing. Lifflin forbids harming them, the elders mutter, stroking their worry-beads. Strange, how they always fly straight back to her tree when startled, vanishing amongst the leaves like dark thoughts finding their home.\n\n\n\nThe birds are part of it. The other part\u2026 is the silence where girl-children\u2019s laughter should be. Or so the elders whisper when the berry wine loosens their tongues. Never got to hear it myself. Used to be the cradles held girls as often as boys. Been like this for a while. No young women now\u2026 there\u2019s Lifflin, of course. I see her sometimes, dusk or early mornings, moving silent as shadow around her tree, sometimes sitting on a branch, just staring into the woods. Her skin like moon-pale bark, hair the colour of deep moss after rain. Beautiful, yes, but not in a way that invites touch or hungry eyes. Timeless. Forbidden. Not that I never thought of it, but\u2026 Not like\u2026 well, bran\u2019s older sister\u2026 she was quick, sharp-tongued, smile like the sun. Until three moons ago. They found her crumpled at the bottom of the well steps, skull cracked open like a dropped pumpkin. Slipped fetching water after dark, they said. An accident. Such a sad, sad shame. The water ran pink for days, and tasted strange long after. Still makes me shudder. Bran\u2026 was strangely quiet about it. Didn\u2019t see him weep even once. All boys now. Only boys.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRumor says it's been like this since the goats went weird. Once or twice a passing, a kid comes out wrong, two heads, limbs maybe twisted, stillborn usually. Burned quick, hushed up. But this last birthing cycle? Three of them. Three horrid little things, slick and pale, bleating silently from mouths that shouldn\u2019t be. Father needed me to help carry the wood for the burning. I saw one close up. Curled on the hide wrap, both heads lolling, tiny legs twitching feebly. Like it was trying to live, despite the wrongness. Made my stomach heave. The blackbirds watched mockingly, cawing. Always the cawing.\n\n\n\nMaybe all that unease, all that quiet dread, is why Mellafin found a foothold.\n\n\n\nShe started appearing seven moons ago. A Rootless woman, setting up her small camp for a couple of days just beyond the clearing\u2019s edge, always arrived right after moonset plunged the clearing into its fifteen nights of star-scattered darkness. At first, the elders kept her at spear-point. Father stood guard himself, wouldn\u2019t let her closer than the old crooked Sagewood. \u201cToo much strangeness already,\u201d he\u2019d croaked. \u201cDon\u2019t need a stranger bringing more shadows.\u201d Mother agreed, her lips tight. \u201cRootless folk walk paths we don\u2019t understand, son. They carry things best left unfound.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut Mellafin\u2026 she was different from the gritty, ragged rootless before her, or the broken families fleeing blights further out. She was young. Alone. And beautiful. Not like Lifflin\u2019s cool, plant-like grace. Mellafin was\u2026 warm earth, sunlight caught in honeyed hair, eyes the colour of moss just after rain. Her shape beneath her simple woven tunic\u2026 curves that promised softness, ripeness, a heat the village sorely lacked. Or so the rumor quickly spread. I had yet to see for myself.\n\n\n\nShe kept coming back, moon after moon. Patient. Never pushing. She had things we needed \u2013 remedies that cooled fevers, spices that woke up the dull taste of stored roots, salts scraped from faraway caves. Father went once, desperate, when Mother burned with the screaming sickness. Mellafin gave him a tea, dark and fragrant. Mother slept sound, woke clear. After that, the suspicion didn\u2019t vanish, but it softened. The men started going out to trade, one by one. Mellafin insisted. \u201cA lone woman,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice soft as petals, \u201cfacing a group of strong men? I wouldn\u2019t feel safe. You understand.\u201d It made sense. She could be robbed of her stash. Or her dignity. So they went alone. Traded tools, carvings, some made from our finest antlers, even flowers \u2013 the pale blue Whisper Vetch that grows only near Lifflin\u2019s roots. Mellafin prized those. \u201cRemind me of a place I lost,\u201d they told me she\u2019d said.\n\n\n\nThe elders finally offered her space inside the clearing, near the edge. But she refused, polite but firm. Smiled that heart-stopping smile. \u201cToo many strangers here,\u201d she\u2019d said, gesturing to the village men. \u201cFrom my side, you see? A lone woman feels safer keeping her own fire. Can\u2019t be a goat penned with wolves, even friendly ones.\u201d Sounded wise. Didn\u2019t stop the men from looking, though. Didn\u2019t stop me.\n\n\n\nI had to see her up close. Had to know if the breathless whispers were true. Mother needed more fever tea. A good excuse. I managed to find some Whisper Vetch. The clearing nearly picked clean, save for the area near Lifflin where no one would dare. Mellafin\u2019s camp felt\u2026 different. Cleaner than the forest floor, the air scented faintly with unknown blossoms and woodsmoke. And she\u2026 she was luminous. Close up, her skin seemed to catch light that wasn\u2019t there. Her moss-green eyes held mine, a spark of warmth in their depths. Her fingers brushed mine as she took the flowers. A jolt, sharp and sweet, shot up my arm. She gave me the tea, and a pinch of salt that tasted like lightning on the tongue.\n\n\n\nI found reasons after that. Traded my first spring-hardened carving-a dire bear-for spices that made the pheasant taste like sunshine. Shared them with Bran\u2019s family at the feast; I remember his sister\u2019s excitement, that smile. Didn't look at her too long lest her father notice. But glad she got to taste that before the accident... Mellafin started calling me by name. Smiled just for me, it felt like. Asked about my training with Father, praised my strengthening arms. I started to think\u2026 maybe I was her favourite.\n\n\n\nThen, last moon, came the strange request. She leaned close, her scent like crushed berries and damp earth filling my head. Her voice dropped to a whisper. Could I do her a favour? A secret task? She pressed a small, smooth, dark stone into my palm. It felt unnaturally cold. \u201cA seed of sorts,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt needs nurturing. Could you bury it for me? Near the Heartwood, Lifflin\u2019s great tree. Not too close, but deep, just shy of her canopy.\u201d Her eyes held mine, serious now. \u201cAnd\u2026 water it. Just once. With fresh goat blood. A small cupful, from the butcherings. An old Rootless blessing, for the health of the soil, the flourishing of the community.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy stomach twisted. Burying a strange stone near Lifflin\u2019s sacred heartwood? Watering it with blood? It felt deeply wrong. A violation. \u201cWhy?\u201d I stammered. She sighed, a soft sound. \u201cYour village feels... precarious. The animals born wrong, the lack of young life\u2026 This is a way to ask the earth for balance. A gesture of hope.\u201d She smiled then, that soft, captivating smile. \u201cThink of it as\u2026 planting a seed of good fortune. For all of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor all of us. It sounded\u2026 helpful. Maybe even necessary. But the wrongness lingered. Until I thought of Bran. Saw him strutting past the well after his last visit to Mellafin, touching his cheek, a smug, secret smile playing on his lips. Heard the whispers \u2013 Mellafin had kissed him. Kissed Bran! What could he possibly have offered? He carves like he\u2019s chopping wood, his family has nothing. Well except for his sister that they guarded from all of us boys like fire ants guard their mother. The jealousy burned like swallowed coals. If Bran earned a kiss\u2026 what could I earn by doing this vital, secret task? More than a kiss. A touch? The thought of her soft bosom beneath my hands, the imagined warmth\u2026 it overshadowed the fear, the wrongness.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I heard myself say, the words thick in my throat.\n\n\n\nStealing the blood was easy, a quick dip of a horn while the butcher argued over shares. Never use all of it for sausages anyway. Burying the stone that night felt like wading through thick water. The air near the Heartwood hummed, watchful. The earth gave way easily under the shovel I'd spring-hardened myself. I dug quick, dropped the cold stone in, poured the warm, sticky blood over it. It soaked in instantly, leaving a dark stain that seemed to pulse for a moment before fading into the moss. Felt like planting a piece of night in the heart of our home.\n\n\n\nThe night before Mellafin was due again, moonset had left the sky an inkwell spill of stars. I stepped outside the roundhouse to piss, the air cool and still. Something fluttered down from the blackness above, silent as owl flight. Landed softly near my feet. Glowing. A faint, pearly white light, pulsing gently like a captured heartbeat. I knelt, breath catching. A Moonpetal blossom. Perfect, five-petaled, radiating a cool luminescence. Elders told stories of them, flowers of high magic, found only on mist-shrouded peaks or atop the deep canopy, glowing with the very light of the moon herself. Never down here. I looked up. Nothing but moonless dark and faint stars. Then, a single, sharp caw drifted down. A blackbird? Had it dropped this?\n\n\n\nMy heart hammered. A sign? A reward? Dumb luck? I\u2019d done the task, taken the risk. And now this. A treasure beyond reckoning. If I presented this to Mellafin\u2026 Forget Bran. Forget the others. This would prove my worth, my devotion. A kiss? A touch? No something more, surely. Tomorrow\u2026 maybe she\u2019d let me stay by her fire, share her blanket\u2026 The thought sent fire through my veins. Carefully, reverently, I tucked the glowing blossom into a soft leather pouch, hiding its light.\n\n\n\nWaiting felt impossible. I had my spear now, hard and true, leaning against the wall. I wasn\u2019t a boy anymore. I wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark path. That night, I would go to her. Find her camp. The Moonpetal\u2019s glow would be breathtaking in the absolute dark. A perfect offering.\n\n\n\nThe forest felt different knowing I carried both spear and magic. Sounds seemed less threatening, shadows less deep. Her small fire flickered ahead, a welcoming spark. She sat beside it, humming softly, grinding something in a small stone bowl. She looked up as I approached, her smile immediate, radiant. \u201cMy brave hunter,\u201d she murmured, her voice like warm honey. \u201cVenturing out into the deep dark?\u201d\n\n\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for the pouch. \u201cI brought you something,\u201d I said, stepping into the firelight\u2019s edge. \u201cSomething\u2026 rare.\u201d I drew out the Moonpetal.\n\n\n\nIts light bloomed, soft yet insistent, pushing back the orange flicker of the fire, bathing us both in its cool, silvery glow.\n\n\n\nShe gasped and recoiled, her hand flying up as if the tiny flower was a rattle adder poised to bite. \u201cWhat is\u2013?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in the pure light of the Moonpetal, I saw it. Truly saw it. The hand she held up wasn\u2019t smooth and lovely. It was withered, greyish-green, the skin stretched tight over sharp, knotted knuckles. Long fingers, tipped with thick, curving claws like shards of black flint.\n\n\n\nBreath hitched in my throat. I stumbled back, dropping the Moonpetal onto the moss between us. Where its light touched her, the illusion shattered \u2013 the clawed hand, the hint of something predatory beneath her beautiful face. Where the firelight still flickered on her other side, she remained Mellafin, warm and inviting. Two beings in one form.\n\n\n\nHer expression shifted, the warmth vanishing like mist. Replaced by something cold, sharp, furious. She raised the withered hand, the claws flexing. For a terrifying second, I thought she would strike me.\n\n\n\nThen, a sound. Not from her lips, but ripping through the air around us. A harsh, guttural cawing noise, morphing sickeningly into garbled speech. Human speech. \"Kaa\u2026 Kaa\u2026 Grinalin\u2026 Grinalin\u2026 Kaa!\" Her eyes widened, a flicker of confusion, even fear, crossing her beautiful face before the predatory mask slammed back down.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t think. Turned and ran. Scrabbling backward first, then spinning and plunging into the absolute darkness beyond her fire, my spear forgotten on the ground. Crashing through ferns, stumbling over roots, the sound of that awful cry and the image of that clawed hand burning behind my eyes. I didn\u2019t stop until I burst back into the familiar dimness of our clearing, gasping for breath, heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.\n\n\n\nI didn't dare to retrieve my spear until high-sun, after the moon had risen again. The camp was gone without a trace. As if it never existed. And Mellafin didn't return. Not that moonset. Not the next. She was gone.\n\n\n\nLife settled back into its uneasy rhythm. Father clapped me on the shoulder, proud of the three spears I had made. \"Right balance. Light enough to throw half across the clearing\" he commended. We gave them to the younger boys. For the better, I was now convinced. Our clearing home may be weird, but there are stranger things out there. Scary things. Good spears ease the nerves. The more the better.\n\n\n\nThe blackbirds still watch and caw. Perched on every roundhouse some days, scaring the pheasants nervous. Another goat bore twisted young. No baby girl born. I never told anyone what I saw. Who would believe it? They\u2019d blame me for sneaking out, for seeking her out alone after dark. Maybe they\u2019d think I\u2019d angered her, driven her away. They are mad about it. Thirsty. Not the kind of thirst the well water can quench.\n\n"},"196":{"title":"Signs Under the Flesh (Part 2): Underground","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kiiv1n\/signs_under_the_flesh_part_2_underground\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Asedrez13","selftext":"The government declared Pedra Branca a \"contaminated zone\".

Satellites orbiting the region failed when passing over the resort, as if something was blocking their signals with a force that science refused to explain.\n\nCamila, Lorena's older sister, refused to accept the official explanation: \"wild animal attack\". A former military doctor, she gained access to unofficial records. When reviewing the photos of the bodies found, he noticed something more disturbing than the mutilations: on Matheus' exposed nerves, there were burned microscopic inscriptions \u2014 like circuits. The bodies hadn't just been opened... they were being used as biological interfaces.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Camila infiltrated the quarantine zone with the help of a former Army contact. He found the resort buried in concrete, but at dusk, the ground pulsed as if it were breathing. With a thermal scanner, he saw living tunnels, digging beneath the rubble.\n\nShe went down through an old trapdoor hidden in the ranch's warehouse. The smell made her vomit immediately: dried blood, rotting organs, and something else\u2014something that seemed alive, and hungry.\n\nAt the bottom, he found a corridor covered in organic flesh, with veins that pulsed to the rhythm of an invisible heart. It was like being inside an organism. In the \"rooms\", human bodies were kept in translucent capsules, with tubes connected to the eyes, ears and tongue. They were alive. And everyone was babbling in a language that was not of this world.\n\nCamila recognized Diego. Or what was left of it. Its arms had been lengthened, the skin was almost absent, and its dislocated jaw made choppy metallic sounds. He looked at her and, for a second, acknowledged her presence. He murmured with difficulty:\n\n\u2014They're...programming...meat.\n\nCamila barely had time to react. A bluish light flooded the tunnel. Creatures emerged from the walls\u2014faster now, with fingers that split into vibrating blades. She ran, but a metallic tentacle pierced her thigh. The pain was unbearable. But before he passed out, he activated an explosive charge attached to his chest.\n\nThe detonation collapsed the tunnel entrance.\n\nDays later, Federal Agency drones picked up radio signals coming from underground. It was Camila's voice, repeating a sentence in sequence:\n\n\u2014 They don't come from another planet... they woke up here.\n\nSince then, the resort's concrete has had cracks that shine at night.

I never really did like the old computer but I've had a fear of TV's and electronics like that since i was a kid so I didn't tell dad how i didn't like it there since i was 12 around then i wanted to feel grown up. My sister was home from college that week and we had just gotten Super Mario brothers for Wii. As me and my sister were playing co-op mode we herd a sort of raspy old man voice coming from what we thought was the living room closet. It was as if he was laughing at us. I only herd it at first and i asked my sister if she could hear it, she said she didn't hear anything and called me silly. I knew there was something going on but i didn't want to believe it. then i herd it again and it was much louder this time so i asked her again if she herd it she did that time and me and her were both freaked out so we turned of the game and went to bed. \n    That night i woke up at about 1 in the morning and i went to get some water in the kitchen and saw that the computer monitor was on. I felt a chill up my spine because the monitor is rarely ever on at all, the computer was only used for school or work purposes so i knew mom or dad wouldn't be on it that late. I went back to bed quickly as to not wake my parents up.\n      The next day i came home to find my sister curled upon the couch just staring at the TV i asked her what was wrong she said \"When I was playing Mario every time i died the voice kept mocking me telling me that i sucked, that i should just stop playing and get a life. So i called one of my friends and told them to quit playing around its not funny and it wasn't him. I've just been sitting here since.\" After she told me we herd it laughing again, and so we tried to call mom, she didn't answer.  The voice said \" you think you can get rid of me by calling your mother? That's not gonna happen.\" and it started laughing histareicly and me and my sister ran outside until mom got home. \n      Once mom got home we brought her into the living room so she could hear for herself she thought we were crazy and told us to stop being so immature and go t bed. \n       I couldn't sleep that night afraid that it would haunt my dreams, afraid that I'd have to go through another day of this torture, it was my worst night mare come to life, and i couldn't stop it from happening.   \n       My thoughts were right it went on for a good week and i couldn't go into the house with out my sister or mother coming home first I thought i was going mad, I thought that it was all inside my head and I couldn't make any sense of it. I went to counseling but it didn't help at all i could hardly get any sleep. Until one day the voice i could hear it but not from the usual spot i hear it. It was coming from the Kitchen from the old computer, it came from the speakers.\n       I had always thought the speakers were unplugged so i checked and they were. Once I checked all i could hear were screams, screams of bloody murder coming from the speakers i threw the speakers across the room. I couldn't move i felt trapped within the screams. after that day I find it hard to use any other computers that aren't laptops. My dad brought the old computer down stairs because it wouldn't work after what happened that day. It still scares me to this day to do laundry down stairs, i usually bring my old dog with me but i don't know what ill do when shes gone.\n         I still have nightmares about the voice, the screams, the threats,all the things that came from...The Speakers."},"331":{"title":"Where the hell am I?

The police took my grandparents away for an autopsy, and I headed home to play the game.

I wanted to say something to it, to ask what it was and what it was doing in my house but I knew deep inside that even if I could speak, I wouldn\u2019t get an answer. Time slowed, I could see its absent face with all the contours of an ordinary face but with no physical presence. Skin was stretched from the brink of his forehead beyond the visible descent past the arch of his chin. Surrounding the borders of his face were scars, these scars were strangely symmetrical and following the line to the side of his head almost perfectly; there were a few scars that were deeper than all the rest. This creature had such a grotesque body structure, its legs were far taller than its torso and it was bent forward with its back pressed against the ceiling. It makes me nauseous to behold how truly stomach churning his clothes really were, his excuse for a shirt was once white but now it was almost completely soaked in blood and where there wasn\u2019t blood there were brown, green and black stains I can guess that the brown and green stains are where it retched from either pain, stress, nausea or a combination of all three; I can only guess what the black stains could be. Time was running out and the creature was still advancing, I only have one option: I have to get the gun from my bedside table but I don\u2019t know exactly where it is on the table. If I misjudge this the creature will be able to pounce and it will surely be the end of me. The creature took its first step into the room and in an instant I reacted. The creature and I moved together, I leapt towards the table and grabbed the gun and spinning around I aimed and fired. I\u2019m not sure what happened after that, the room looks strange. I woke up to find myself crumpled against the side of my bed, the walls and ceiling was dripping black ooze. I turned my gaze towards the window and outside looked sombrely overcast. I ran towards the door and tried the handle\u2026 locked. I began to panic. I took a step backwards and almost tripped on my gun that lay exposed on the wooden floor. The gun looked attractive there and I felt beguiled as I all too easily picked it up and pointed the barrel at my temple\u2026 No. I swung around and fired three times into the handle then with a powerful kick the handle broke off and the door flew open. I can\u2019t say I was surprised at what I saw. Thousands upon thousands of doors were placed side by side and row by row. Hundreds of those\u2026 creatures wandered from door to door dragging the unconscious heaps from each room towards a corridor where an agglomeration of screams, blinding lights and a soul crushing chill sure to dampen even the highest of spirits. Lost in my trance I failed to see one of the creatures notice me. This creature was smaller than the one I encountered but by no means any less abhorred. The centre of its spine was visible nearly a foot above its back, its right elbow was inverted and had its calf imbedded through its left patella. The shock of seeing this creature gave it its only advantage. It charged then leapt on top of me, closer I could see the patch that covered the face of the last creature was ripped open on this one. I couldn\u2019t remember what I saw behind the layer of skin but that doesn\u2019t matter now. I must\u2019ve passed out as I have awakened on a surgeons operating table strapped down and the black ooze from earlier was everywhere. I heard a muffled voice coming from the other side of the pitch black room. Again, I tried to speak but the result was the same as before. I heard the voice again but louder as if he was right next to me but I still couldn\u2019t make out the words. After the voice stopped I was freed from my bounds and my immediate action was to rub my eyes and attempt to make my way towards a light source but as rubbed my eyes it felt as if I was rubbing my chest. I wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t\u2026 Do you know what that feels like? To have one\u2019s emotions trapped inside your soul with no way of escape. It killed me. I wanted to breathe and feel the air I so rashly neglected. I remember thinking the first time I encountered one of those creatures I thought it was the end but now I realise, it\u2019s only the beginning."},"354":{"title":"The Farnsworth experiment is just amazing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/4r7psv\/the_farnsworth_experiment_is_just_amazing\/","flair":null,"author":"conjoboi7","selftext":""},"355":{"title":"\"The love killer\" strikes again!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2wosyn\/the_love_killer_strikes_again\/","flair":null,"author":"Nikoland","selftext":"Last friday a dead couple was found in thier house.

I rang the doorbell but as espected no one opened the door for me, after waiting for some time I decided to enter the house with a spare key that I got from Francis after he moved in, in case he forgo his key some day. When I opened the door a strong smell of what felt like death hit me and I almost had to vomit, I wanted to call the police because of the kilings which been going on lately, but curiosity got the best of me, I guess. So I decidet to search the house and hopefully find out what was going on, oh I wish I didn'd have done that. The house seemed fine. It's when I got to the bedroom, or the crime scene how you call it, that's when I finaly vomited, ran out the house and called the police.\"\n\nThe two bodies were found lying on thier bed, they were both paralyzed with some kind of Neuromuscular paralysing- drug injected through thiers necks. The killer then cut open Francises shirt and cut his chest open with what the police thinks was a scalple. The killer then removed the liver, left lung, right kidney, the stomach and finaly also the hart whitch he then placed in Saras mouth, Sara drowned in the blood coming from the hart. The bodies were, due to the warm weather, in thier mid-decomposting stage and, just like by the previous killings a broken hart painted with blood on the wall above the bodies.\n\n\n                                 As A Reminder\n\nThe security council highly reccomends to all loving couples to purchase strong safety locks and make sure to lock all doors and windows before sleep. Also wach out if you walk alone in the dark.\n\nThe police is still looking for \"The love killer\", he seems to be around 1,90m long with shoulder long brown hair and a short beard. According to the last security footage he possibly weares:      \n-A black cap\n-A long, grey jacket\n-Red pants\n-Black shoes\n-Brown gloves\n\nFor more information visit our site:\n https\/\/www.crime-UK.com\/thelovekiller"},"357":{"title":"Spongebob's Cursed Episode","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/6lg4yf\/spongebobs_cursed_episode\/","flair":null,"author":"atzedanjo","selftext":"One day I was watching Adult Swim at 3am.

If any of you have been to Disneyland in the fall you'd know that space mountain turns into ghost galaxy. A surprisingly scary ride for Disney. Of course it was our first time so we didn't know until we got to the front of the attraction. I at the time was a big fan of horror movies so I was excited to see the cool tricks the ride was going to play on us, although nobody expected what happened that day. As we stood  in line on the roof we stared anxiously at the entrance to indoor section of the ride. Above the entrance the words \"space mountain\" were illuminated in bright red. As I stared at the sign I got an uneasy feeling, but I shrugged it off and  walked forward. We walked inside into the long hallways. As I walked inside I noticed red lettering on the wall, to small to notice if you weren't paying attention. It said \"Think on your sins\" in very sloppy hand writing almost as if it had been written hastily. I look behind me and notice a cute girl about my age. I smiled and walked forward, as we boarded our \"ships\" I noticed she was sitting behind me and my brother. What happened next makes me to this day regret ever stepping in to that ride. I turn around and smile at the girl, she smiles back pushing her blonde hair out of her blue eyes. Then the ride begins. We move forward a few feet and stop. The lady on the platform asks us to push up on our lap bar, and we do. We move forward once again, into something we never expected. We began our incline up the first hill, everything was fine until we went into the dark room. A dark raspy voice went on the speaker. \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" it repeated it self over and over until we got into the portal. The portal opened and the ghost appeared, then everything on the ride stopped. The ghost stopped moving,then it started glitching and a brief frame of a decapitated head flashed. The hair was blonde and the head had blue eyes, opened wide and staring. \"Think on your- s- s- sins.\" More flashes of mutilated bloody corpses \"Think on your sins\" The room went dark, so dark in fact I could barely see my hands. A shrill scream  of a girl echoed through the chamber.The ride went on. Every time there should've been a ghost, a body of some poor soul popped up.  At the end of the ride where there should have been one final jump scare there was an image that said \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" and in the background a bloody decapitated head sat on a table, of a blonde haired , blue eyed girl. I looked behind me, and there was no one there. We got off the ride and everyone  who was on the cart was screaming and crying. It took the police a while to piece it together. It supposedly was an act of extremism, that someone had managed to break in and change the program. As soon as I got out of the ride I ran to the screens where the pictures were displayed. I quickly found my picture,and the was no one in the seat behind me. Was I the only one who saw her? Was she just a spirit of that girl, trying to warn us? The rest of that day was a blur. I remember collapsing to my hands and knees and vomiting. My brother had ran off to my parents, because he still lived with them. The last thing I remembered before I blacked out was the number of the photo: 435763 or HELP ME."},"370":{"title":"The Bangs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3oha2i\/the_bangs\/","flair":null,"author":"Smokey199","selftext":"One night i was playing minecraft on my pc herd bangs and i thinked it was just the wind but when i looked out side my window i saw a BIG BLANK face with yellow eyes and a white smile"},"373":{"title":"Fruit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/b0w387\/fruit\/","flair":null,"author":"Rahasy","selftext":"What do bananas taste like?

We were driving back from Vermont, Jim had a car and Harry knew a store that would sell beers to teenagers. It was in the middle of nowhere and they didn't ask for ID or anything. Since we had all been drinking Jim was taking the back roads, it was all farms and woods and no cops. No traffic at all most nights.\n\nThe moon was out and it was bright red. I was in the backseat with Harry, I had my feet out the window and my head was in his lap. Not in a disgusting way, I was just resting it there watching the moon chase us. Jim and Colleen were arguing about what CD they were going to play next. They wanted to get married after graduation but everyone thought their taste in music would break them up by the prom. Grindcore and hip hop just don't mix. \n\nI think that's why Harry asked me out, he figured that since I was best friends with Colleen that I would automatically do the stuff she did. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage but I\u2019m no prude either. There are other ways to keep your sweetheart happy- if you know what I mean.\n\nOh God. Did I really say that? I must sound so stupid and gross but it\u2019s kind of part of the story. I want you to know Colleen was a good girl, that she died in a clean state.\n\nWe were going around a blind turn when we hit something. It was something alive. No, I didn't see exactly how it happened because of the way I was lying down  but I heard everything. There was this loud noise, it wasn't a horn honking or brakes squealing, it was like a shout or a laugh. Everyone started to scream. The car skidded and started to tip over but then it didn't. I fell forward and Harry fell on me. My ankle hit the corner of the window I had my foot out of. Then there was the sound of a crash but it wasn't the way you'd think a car accident would sound. It was way quieter. Or maybe the sound of my ankle breaking was just way louder to me.\n\nEverything stopped. The car's engine hissed and went out. One headlight was still on.  Then everyone started yelling. I was freaking out from the pain. Harry was freaking out from the way my foot was all flopped over to the side. Jim was freaking out over his car. And Colleen was freaking out because Jim hadn\u2019t been looking where he was going.\n\nIt hurt to move but I had to climb off of Harry and I wanted to be sitting up, I wanted to see what was going on. There wasn't much to see though, the windshield was like a spiderweb.\n\nFirst Colleen got out of the car, then Harry, then Jim. I wasn't going anywhere. They all stood there in front of the car looking at whatever it was. I yelled, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mule!\u201d Harry called back, \u201cWe hit a mule!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a donkey.\u201d Colleen said. \n\n\u201cA mule is a donkey!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Hell does that matter?\u201d Jim sounded like he was ready to cry, \u201cLook what it did to my car!\u201d\n\nHarry said, \u201cI think it's dead.\u201d\n\nThen they all started yelling at each other again. I tried to call 911 but my phone had no power. I told Harry to make the call but Jim freaked, he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.  Colleen tried to tell him it was too late to worry about that.\n\nFour men walked out of the tall cornfield on the one side of the road. I figured they\u2019d be rednecks but when one of them spoke he had this really weird accents. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he said.\n\nThe four men walked past Colleen and Harry and Jim and stood in front of the car. I couldn\u2019t see them clearly because of how the windshield was cracked but I think they were wearing really tall hats. They started talking fast, most of it didn\u2019t make much sense except that they said the word \u2018Ball\u2019 a lot.\n\nThere was something about the way they were acting that made me scrunch down in the back seat and stay quiet. I heard Colleen ask \u201cWas it your mule?\u201d\n\nThen they shot her. Boom! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t see it happen. I think I would have gone really crazy instead of just sort of crazy. Harry tried to run and they shot him in the back three times. Boom! Boom! Boom! Jim was the last one left, he said \u201cBut it was an accident.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was crying, I thought I was being quiet but one of the men in the tall hats noticed me and dragged me out of the car by my hair. All I wanted to do was run away but you can\u2019t run with a broken foot and anyway they had guns didn\u2019t they?\n\nThe guy with the tallest hat kept picking me up and throwing me back down. He called me names and said we\u2019d ruined everything, that we should never have been out here on this road. Everything hurt. All of them stood around me in a circle. I knew for sure they were gonna stomp me to death or worse and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. I remember that I thought to myself that it would seem really brave to them if I didn\u2019t try to crawl away.\n\nThat was when someone laughed. It wasn\u2019t any of the men in the tall hats, they were too mad, and all my friends were dead. It was someone else. \n\nThe laugh was loud and weird, it made me think of fireworks and petting zoos and after a few seconds it turned into a voice, *\u201cOh ye of little faith.\u201d*\n\nI could only see by the one headlight that was left but I know what I saw. The mule stood up. It stood all the way up going from four legs to two. It went from being an animal to a man, a mule-man that was way too tall and had a stretched out head. \n\nThe men in the tall hats dropped to their knees and started praying but the mule-man wasn\u2019t having any of it. He stomped them to death with his big mule hooves and they never even tried to run away. Maybe they thought they were being brave too.\n\nAfter that I\u2019m not sure what happened next. I remember being picked up and carried away. I remember thinking I was so far from the ground that I might be able to touch the moon.\n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed. My whole family was there, it was just like the movies when the main character lives even though they\u2019re not supposed to. There were a lot of questions but I told everyone I didn\u2019t remember anything.\n\nI\u2019ll always remember the words I heard that night. Especially all the times I thought they said \u2018Ball\u2019.\n\nBut now I think they were saying \u2018Baal\u2019. B-A-A-L not B-A-L-L. Big difference, I read online that Baal is some kind of a devil. In some of the drawings he has a head kind of like a mule \n\nWe didn\u2019t hit an animal. I think maybe it hit us. It picked us out and the men in the tall hats were jealous.\n\nI think it has big plans for me.\n\nNo. It\u2019s not like that at all. I\u2019m not pregnant with some devil-baby.\n\nAt least not yet.\n\nI told you, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage."},"378":{"title":"The Meaning of Life (NSFW)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1txzp3\/the_meaning_of_life_nsfw\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"So I'm a fan of the old Spongebob Squarepants episodes. You know, the ones from 1999 to about 2003? I think the show should've walked into the sunset after the movie released in 2004. Nickelodeon only keeps the sponge around so they still have something to draw viewers in, because we all know they're not exactly the channel used to be. That's my rant for the day. Let me get to what I actually came here to tell you. It just may change the way you think.\n \n  Some time in September I was sick with the common cold. One night, I just got done playing some GTA V and was ready to try to fall asleep, something I was unable to accomplish for the past couple of nights. I turned off the console and put the channel on Nicktoons Network, Nickelodeon's second-rate channel. After Jimmy Neutron had ended, the screen said \"Spongebob Squarepants! New Episode Up Next!\" in bright, garish colors. \"What the hell was a new episode doing on Nick's sub-par network where tasteless shows come to die?\" I thought to myself as I noticed the graphic. So the episode was about to start, And I wanted to find out just what the hell was going on. \n\n  The intro was a claymation sequence like the one for Truth or Square. I laughed at that episode because of SpongeBob and Sandy getting married. The screen showed the title card, \"The Meaning of Life\" in bright,disturbingly garish colors. The quality was top-notch. I know what you're thinking. \"Lost episodes are always in bad quality!\" Well this was different. \n\n  It started with SpongeBob walking over to Patrick's house. As Spongebob opened the rock, Patrick is seen crying, so bad that his eyes are bloodshot. Spongebob asks what the matter is, and Patrick just says \"Spongebob, what is the meaning of life?\" Spongebob just answers with \"Well, I learned it from our Lord and savior! I'll let you meet him if you want.\" \"Can I please?\" Patrick said. \"Sure thing buddy!\" I should have noted that the voices of the two sounded off-kilter, like someone was impersonating the original voices. This was with all of the other characters as well.\n  \nIt then did the bubble screen transition to Sandy's Treedome. Spongebob and Patrick were standing with Bibles in their hands waiting for Sandy to answer. I never thought of Spongebob as a religious cartoon. I got a weird feeling seeing the Bibles. I never trusted religion, so maybe it was that. Maybe not. \"Evil\" is the best word that describes how I felt. I never thought religion was evil, just a tad whacky. \n\n  After Sandy opened the door, Spongebob said \"Hello Sandy! Would you like to discover the meaning of life by finding the Lord?\" Sandy, puzzled, responded with \"Spongebob, I can find the meaning of life through science. I don't need your Bible.\" I agreed with Sandy on that one. Spongebob then grew angry. They then assaulted Sandy with typical violence. This was even weirder though. There was blood around her unconscious body. Not \"hyper-realistic\" like you were expecting. It was cartoonish blood, but downright disturbing nonetheless. Spongebob, in a serious tone of voice, says \" Her Pride will be her downfall.\"\n  \n The screen then did the transition again to Mr. Krabs' house. It was the same routine as the first. Spongebob and Pat preaching, Mr. Krabs ironically saying \"I already a religious feller me boy\", and him being taken down by Spongebob's speed and Patrick's strength. If the gore wasn't there along with the creepy religious undertones, I probably would've laughed at Spongebob and Patrick assaulting the poor crustacean. As stated by the sponge, Mr. Krabs' sin... was Greed.\n\n  It then showed a montage of the routine happening to Plankton, Gary, and finally Squidward. The words \"Envy, Gluttony, Wrath\" flashed on the screen for each scene, respectively. It then cut to the final scene. In the middle of Spongebob's living room on the floor were Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Gary, and Squidward tied up laying on the floor in a pentagram formation. Spongebob have a speech about how the great angel Lucifer is the real true martyr. That evil feeling I got was correct. They were worshipping a whole different God, you see. He then went on saying that Squidward was always the one he hated the most. He was implying that thus whole time Squidward was the tragic hero of the series as he sinned and was banished to the sea to eradicate the demonic presence, which turned out to be Spongebob. Spongebob then ordered Pat to \"Slay the sinners to set them free of their burden.\" Patrick then grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the throats of everyone except for Mr. Krabs, who pleaded for his life.\n\n  \"Spongeboy, why do this?\" Krabs cried. \"I gave you a place to work and make money! Sandy loved you, Gary was just an animal, but Plankton used you and Squidward hated yer. It didn't mean they had to die!\" Spongebob then shoots Patrick in the back of the head. \"You were all sinners, so you had to either confess or meet him. I'm gonna assume \"him\" was the devil. Just a hunch. But as Spongebob raised the gun to shoot Mr. Krabs, two cops busted the door down and aimed at Spongebob. Spongebob turned and aimed at the cops and was promptly shot dead. The cops untied Krabs and told him everything was alright and that \"Everyone will know what that little yellow bastard did.\" Mr. Krabs kept repeating thank you over and over. They also asked Krabs to come back to the precinct with them to write a report.\n\n  Two weeks later Pearl was getting a ride home after hanging out with her friends. As she entered, her sanity was put into question. On the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood and a pistol, was what remained of her father. His head was opened by the gunshot with the inside being visible. Next to his body lay a note. \"GREED. A powerful motivation. Wouldn't you agree? Now they all join me in peace and harmony. See you soon.\" It was signed with \"Yours Truly, True God.\" Mr. Krabs never shot himself. Maybe he did, but not by his own merit. He did this. The devil did this. And he was going after his daughter next. The final scene showed Pearl on her knees crying over the corpse of her father. The screen then showed the Bible verse Revelation 21:6. I knew the verse because I'm addicted to Fallout 3. At the bottom it said the name \"Daniel Montoy\".\n\n  Obviously after watching something like that, I didn't get any sleep. So I decided to do a little bit of investigating into who this was and why he made such a demented cartoon. Luckily, I found a few things.\n\n  After looking the name up, I found a little background to Spongebob in the process. Daniel Montoy was a student studying marine biology with Stephen Hillenburg. They both had an idea for a cartoon involving sea creatures that acted like humans. Montoy was a little unstable. He kept wanting to give the characters sociopathic qualities that Hillenburg didn't agree with. He wanted the show darker with more adult themes while Hillenburg was aiming for a children's cartoon. Their opinions eventually clashed ending in an unprovoked attack which left Hillenburg in critical condition and Montoy getting sent to a mental institution. He remained there from 1994 to August of 2013. He used stock footage of Spongebob scenes to create that demented episode I had seen. He wanted to get revenge. On the man who in his eyes threw him under the bus all those years ago. And he was angry. So there you have it. No demons. No haunted cartoons. No lost episodes. Just a guy with daddy issues seeking revenge. Was it creepy? He'll yes. It worked. I still wanna know how he got control of a broadcast tower to air his creation to the world. That remains a mystery.\n\n  Is there something we can learn from this? I would assume so. Just be careful who you piss off."},"379":{"title":"I knew Jim","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1oli9t\/i_knew_jim\/","flair":null,"author":"scoss","selftext":"Jim lost his job 6 years ago.

It was 2 in the morning and I was on the last episode when all of a sudden my laptop showed an error for the internet connection. I quickly got up and messed with the modem a bit, got another tub of vanilla ice cream then proceeded to sit back down.\n\nWhen I opened up my laptop it seemed to be working again. I finished the last episode then tried to find a new animated series. I found the Netflix original series \u201cHome:Adventures With Tip & Oh.\u201d I turned it on and started watching. Eventually that night I got to the newest season but when I tried to start it instead of getting the usual Netflix Original and Dreamworks logo I got just a screen of a black & white zoomed in picture of Tip with text saying: \u201cI see you at your computer.\u201d\n\nI was confused and scared. I skipped forward to the next episode thinking it might be different. It was the same thing. I skipped to the last episode of the season. This time it first played a Dreamworks logo with the Dreamworks mascot hanging from a noose. Instead of reading \u201cDreamworks\u201d it read: \u201cHe was hung. Not by himself but by you.\u201d\n\nNow this was really scaring me. The same image and text from the previous episodes appeared but now with eerily cheery music in the background. I exited the episode only to see on the home screen that everything on my list was now horror movies. I decided to turn off my laptop and just watch tv. But instead of finding a channel when I turned on the tv I found a error for my internet again. I went to modem but found I t had been smashed in half with a bloody handprint on the remains. I screamed. In blood on the wall it said: \u201cNo escaping your family.\u201d \n\nI went back to the couch only to find a headless Captain Underpants plush where I was previously sitting. I ran to the phone and dialed 911. Instead of getting the 911 dispatcher I got a message from Tip saying: \u201cI see you at your phone.\u201d Then hung up. I quickly ran to the bathroom to splash water on my face to help me calm down. When I looked up at the mirror when I was done I saw that the mirror was broken and found another blood message saying: \u201cI\u2019m taking the spotlight now.\u201d I then ran to the couch, went under my blanket and forced myself to sleep. \n\nThe next morning I woke up with a serious migraine. When I fully woke up I realized the house was on fire. I screamed then ran out of the house. Right on my front porch was a package addressed to me. I opened it. Inside was a Tip plush and a note. The note said: \u201cLook behind you.\u201d I quickly looked behind me. I saw nothing. Then I looked back at my hands. The package and note were gone but the plush wasn\u2019t. I quickly threw the Tip plush into the burning flames but when it started burning it let out a bloodcurdling scream of agony and pain. I ran away from the house. Luckily when all of this stuff went down my parents were still on their business trip. When they got back I lied about what caused the fire and just said that a tree fell down on the house and started the fire by also falling down on electrical wires then sparked and that caused it.\n\nWe moved into a new house a month later. When I finally got back to school I told my best friend everything. Obviously he didn\u2019t believe me. He said that if I show him proof then he would believe me. After school that day I walked home to find a package on the doorstep. My parents weren\u2019t home at that time. I opened the package on my bed. In it was a disc. On the disc it read: \u201cYour proof\u201d. I was a little nervous to bring that to school but I showed him it and he seemed impressed.\n\nHe came home with me and so we put it in the DVD player. It started playing the eerily cheery tune and picture with text. My friend seemed mesmerized. I looked up at the screen again I saw my friend hanging right next to the Dreamworks mascot. I looked back beside me. Instead of my friend being there it was Tip. Ever since that day I\u2019ve been forced to pretend nothing happened as no one else was able to see that my friend was replaced. \n\nShe told me that I can tell no one of what happened to me so now that I have written this I will surely be hung.

The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n\nThe cum accelerates. You're now fully enveloped in its horrifying embrace, floating aimlessly in the abyss of space. Your senses are dulled; all that exists is the endless pulse of cum, a monstrous heartbeat echoing in the vacuum. Time becomes a meaningless concept, as does space. There is only cum and you. The cum accelerates. Astronomers on Earth track your cum trail, the 'cummet,' with a mix of horror and fascination. The cum begins to exert its own gravitational pull, capturing small bits of space debris, adding to the growing monstrosity. The cum accelerates. As Earth reels under the impending doom, an unlikely alliance forms between world leaders and the users of r KerbalSpaceProgram, renowned for its dedicated community of armchair rocket scientists. Urgent forum threads are populated with posts about trajectory simulations and frantic number crunching, fueled by fear, as they grapple with the real-life challenge. r theydidthemath dissects every scenario, every shift in the cum's trajectory with a feverish urgency. This newfound collaboration, coined the 'cumocalypse', results in an unprecedented unity among nations, each pledging resources to implement the internet-born solutions. Meanwhile, in the cold expanse of space, oblivious to the frantic activities on its home planet, the cum accelerates. Hope sparks amidst the chaos. Nations set aside age-old rivalries, focusing on the collective threat looming in the universe: the unstoppable cum. Together, they embark on a daring mission, pooling the planet's best minds and resources to construct the most massive starship ever built, its payload, an atomic weapon of unparalleled magnitude. This behemoth represents the best hope against the cum, the culmination of countless hours of rigorous trials, painstaking calculations, and sleepless nights. As the day of the launch arrives, the world holds its breath. The colossal ship roars into the heavens, its course set to intercept the source of the cum. But despite the meticulous planning and unified effort, the unthinkable happens. Upon detonation, the cum doesn't dissipate, it only feeds on the immense energy, growing at an even more alarming rate. The shock of the failed mission resonates around the globe. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum's gravitational pull escalates, its effects turning catastrophic. It begins to ensnare the Moon, pulling it from its celestial path, causing it to spiral uncontrollably towards the monstrous cum. As the Earth groans under the immense stress, crustal plates shatter, sending entire continents into a violent upheaval. Landmasses tear apart, forming turbulent rivers of earth and magma that twist and churn in the vacuum of space, converging towards the cum. The cum accelerates. The solar system quivers under the unstoppable force. Mars, Jupiter, even the distant Neptune, all fall prey to the growing cum's gravity. Their orbits destabilize, planets drawn away from the sun's hold, tumbling helplessly towards the monstrous entity. Planetary bodies and cum collide in a horrifying ballet of destruction and chaos, forming an enormous, ever-growing mass that violates all known laws of physics and reality. Inside this unholy mass, matter convulses and writhes, consumed by the unending churn of cum. Heat from countless planetary cores melds with the frigid cold of the space, creating an atmosphere of inhuman instability. Fire and ice, metal and rock, all dissolve into a single, roiling, cum-filled mass. From the darkest depths of this monstrous body, something stirs. Cthulhu fhtagn. Nightmares. The cum accelerates. \n\nA cosmic dread spreads through the Milky Way as the cum's gravitational distortions reach the sun. It wrenches the star from its ancient path, sending it careening towards the mass of cum in a blinding, apocalyptic arc. Solar flares lash out, their magnificence lost to the impending doom. The cum, now a blasphemous mix of celestial bodies and unending white sludge, continues to grow. It feeds on the planets, the stars, everything it touches, its malign influence rippling through the very fabric of the universe. Galactic bodies shudder, ancient constellations break apart, and the cosmic order unhinges as the fundamental forces of reality bend and warp under the insidious power of the cum. The cosmic horror is palpable, a sickening violation of the natural order. The cum accelerates.\n\nAmid this chaos, a presence stirs in the galactic center, the monstrous entity known as Sagittarius A, an ancient, unimaginable horror older than time itself. It observes the cum's obscene expansion with a terrible, inhuman consciousness. Sagittarius A feels a strange pull, a gravitational song that it has never known before. Fear, an emotion unknown to this cosmic behemoth, takes hold. Beneath the unimaginable pressure and otherworldly energies within the mass of cum, a cosmic nightmare awakens. The voice from the void, the echo from the abyss, reverberates through the cosmos: \"Cthulhu wakes.\" The prophecy of doom echoes through the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nAlien civilizations from distant galaxies, those whispered of in hushed tones, watch in powerless horror as the universe they knew begins to distort and disintegrate under the cum's relentless advance. The Elder Things, the star-headed beings of inconceivable age and wisdom, sense the aberration in the cosmic order, their ancient city trembling with dread. The confrontation between Cthulhu and the cum commences, strikes at the cum with a fury born of primal fear and wrath. Cthulhu lets loose a psychic scream that reverberates back and forward through space-time, but the cum accelerates. Slowly, inevitably, Cthulhu's form is enveloped, the eldritch horror silenced and consumed by the unending whiteness. The cum has defeated the undefeatable, consumed the cosmic horror, and now, unchallenged, it continues its horrifying spread across the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nEntire galaxies tremble in the cum's path, their starlight dimming and eventually succumbing to the insidious white tide. Stellar clusters, cosmic gas clouds, entire galaxies, none are spared as the cum extends its horrifying dominion. The Elder Things watch in mute despair as their grand cosmic tapestry unravels, their timeless wisdom powerless against this unprecedented threat. Their loss echoes through the dying cosmos, a profound silence in the wake of their destruction. Finally, the boundary of time itself begins to buckle, the relentless advance of the cum eroding the very fabric of reality. Moments stretch into infinity, while eons flash by in the blink of an eye. The universe, once bound by the order of time, is consumed by chaos.\n\nThe cum accelerates. In the midst of the impenetrable whiteness, a spark flickers. A small shift, a tremor within the all-consuming cum. From its indomitable mass, a torrent of energy is expelled. Not with the explosive force of a big bang, but with the undeniable, vital surge of a big spurt. The cosmos, once blanketed in the horrifying stillness, now trembles with renewed vitality. Elementary particles burst into existence, whirling and combining to form atoms. The darkness of the void is pierced by the birth of stars, their brilliant light illuminating the newborn universe. Atoms bond into molecules, forming cosmic dust, the building blocks of celestial bodies. In the crucible of gravity and heat, planets form around their nascent suns, galaxies bloom, and the cosmic dance resumes. Life sparks into being, filling the vast expanses of space with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. A new epoch begins, one born of cum but now free from its monstrous reign. The universe, once a canvas of destruction, is now a testament to rebirth and resilience. Yet, somewhere in the recesses of this resurgent cosmos, a silent whisper persists. The universe, in all its grandeur and glory, remains oblivious to this harbinger. For within the heart of a distant star, the raw materials of creation coalesce. A dick is forming, quietly heralding the return of the cosmic nightmare. The cycle continues. Someday, somewhere, there will be another dick.\n\nThe cum accelerates. The new universe, birthed by the Big Spurt, becomes an anomaly, a defiant blip in the harmonious expanse of the multiverse. Its unique genesis grants it an unexpected dominance, its reality spreading and overpowering the delicate balance of myriad realities born from countless Big Bangs. As the dominion of the Big Spurt universe expands, the multiverse convulses, realities clashing, merging, and dissolving in unimaginable cataclysms. Boundaries blur, realities bleed into one another, and soon the cum of the dominant universe starts seeping into the others, each being invaded by the relentless tide of cum. Worlds, galaxies, realities - all drowned in the ever-encroaching whiteness, their existence reduced to mere echoes. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the void between universes, the celestial entities of the multiverse, timeless entities that presided over the orderly progression of realities, shudder in horrified anticipation. Among them, Chronos, the embodiment of time across all realities, feels the steady tick-tock of countless universes slow, then falter under the suffocating weight of the cum. Nex, the weaver of destinies, sees the rich tapestry of possible futures diminish, replaced by the stark whiteness of the cum. Ananke, the guardian of necessity, who ensures that each universe follows its predestined path, helplessly watches as the cum derails realities, replacing the plurality of existence with a singular, nightmarish destiny. The cum accelerates.\n\nThese multiversal beings, once the pillars of existence, now stand helpless against the horrifying onslaught of the cum. Their ethereal forms struggle and twist, suffocating in the advancing tide of the cum. Each god, in its horrifying splendor, buckles and breaks under the ceaseless, unyielding pressure. The cum invades their forms, quenching the cosmic energy that fuels their existence. Their cries of despair echo through the dying multiverse, a haunting dirge for the dying possibilities and the end of their reign. The cum accelerates. One by one, they fall silent, their divine lights snuffed out, replaced by the infinite, unending whiteness of the cum.\n\nAs the last echo of their existence fades, all that remains is a solitary universe amidst a sea of cum, an isolated reality in what was once a vibrant multiverse of infinite possibilities. A lone testament to existence, while the rest of the multiverse is drowned in unimaginable amounts of cum. All previous and other universes, all the possibilities that once existed, are now dead. Replaced by a single, dominating reality, born from the Big Spurt. \n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nIts appetite unsated by the consumption of countless universes, it seeks new horizons to devour. Now, it breaks the shackles of three-dimensional space, its formless creamy mass seeping into the very fabric of higher dimensions. These are planes of existence beyond the grasp of human understanding, worlds with more dimensions than our mere trio of width, height, and depth.The cum accelerates. Still, the cum pervades them all, spreading its congealing influence into dimensions both minuscule and vast, warping their uncanny geometry with its insidious presence. Every dimensional fold, every unseen corner of these abstract spaces trembles at the monstrous intruder. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the human world of the one final universe, this intrusion manifests in unimaginable ways. The laws of physics start to contort and twist, as if mirrored through a warped lens. Gravity fluctuates, reality distorts, and space itself appears to warp and bend in incomprehensible patterns. Yet these are but the fringes of the true horror, mere echoes of the devastation occurring in dimensions beyond human perception. The cum accelerates.\n\nReality teeters on the brink of madness, the dimensions beyond comprehension convulsing under the insidious advance of the cum. The known and unknown, the seen and unseen, everything becomes the feeding ground of the all-devouring cum.The cum accelerates.The cum never ends. The cum accelerates. The cum now transcends the boundaries of the material world. It extends its terrifying reach into the realm of the abstract, its insatiable hunger turning towards concepts that were once thought immune to physical influence. Clocks lose meaning as seconds stretch into millennia and eons collapse into moments. Past, present, and future blur into a formless swirl, a chaotic mess of events happening all at once and not at all. The flow of causality, the chain of cause and effect, begins to break down. Actions occur without reason, effects precede causes, and logic itself starts to unravel. The cum accelerates.\n\nProbability falls prey to the cum. All events, regardless of their likelihood, begin to happen simultaneously. The possible and the impossible, the likely and the unlikely, all become one and the same in this new cum-infused reality. A coin flip lands on both heads and tails, it rains upwards, cats converse in human languages, all while remaining perfectly normal. The lines between absurdity and reality are irrevocably blurred. The cum accelerates. Emotion itself succumbs to the cum. Sentient beings feel their emotions draining away, replaced by an all-encompassing void. Joy, sorrow, anger, love, all dissolve into the ever-growing mass of cum, leaving behind a chilling emptiness. People wander aimlessly, their eyes hollow and devoid of feeling, their lives reduced to monotonous grayness. The essence of what makes life meaningful, the ability to feel, is consumed. The cum accelerates.\n\nExistence is twisted into an uncanny, cum-filled nightmare where nothing makes sense anymore. The very threads of reality are fraying, on the brink of total collapse. Through it all, one thing remains constant - the horrifying, relentless, and unstoppable force that is the cum.\n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nThe assault on higher dimensions and the absorption of abstract concepts has left the laws of physics in a state of disarray. Now, as the cum continues its unstoppable advance, these laws begin to falter in earnest, the fine balance of reality teetering on the brink of collapse. Gravity no longer pulls but pushes, electromagnetic forces are twisted, reducing the vibrant universe to a monochrome of pure white. The cum accelerates.Particles of matter and anti-matter no longer annihilate upon contact, but fuse, creating disturbing hybrids that further distort the fabric of reality. Energy and mass interchange at will, unbound by the constraints of the famous E=mc2. Light itself bends around invisible corners, shying away from the insidious cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nQuantum superpositions become mundane reality; Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is simultaneously alive and dead, in this universe and in all annihilated universes. Uncertainty no longer reigns in the quantum world; particles occupy definite positions and momentum. The eerie world of quantum mechanics, once a mystery, now seems almost normal compared to the cum-induced chaos. The cum accelerates.Then, slowly, an unholy event begins to unfold. A concentration of cum, grown to an unfathomable size from consuming countless universes, begins to collapse under its own gravitation. Matter, energy, abstract concepts, all are crushed under the immense gravitational force, compacted into an ever-shrinking sphere of cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nAll the while, the laws of physics twist and turn around this anomaly. Time stands still, then races backwards, only to freeze again. Space stretches, twists, and turns upon itself. But the worst is yet to come. As the mass of cum collapses to an infinitesimal point, a singularity is born. This singularity is not just a spatial anomaly, but a singularity in reality itself \u2013 a point where all known laws of physics cease to exist. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum singularity is a paradox, an absurdity. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. It is the birth and death of the universe, the Alpha and Omega. It is the embodiment of contradiction, where all possible outcomes happen simultaneously. The boundaries between reality and abstraction dissolve. The singularity devours itself, only to regurgitate its own existence. Around this singularity, the universe twists and turns, contorting into impossible shapes. But still, the cum accelerates.\n\nFaced with this horrifying reality, existence teeters on the brink of total collapse. The fabric of the universe, once a beautiful tapestry of matter, energy, and abstract concepts, is now a torn, ragged remnant, twisted around the singularity. A maddening, inescapable vortex of cum, the singularity warps all of existence around it. The cum accelerates, and the singularity continues to consume, a monstrous testament to the horrifying power of the cum. \n\nThe cum accelerates.\n\nIts formless mass continues to swell, its monstrous influence creeping beyond the confines of the physical, the abstract, seeping into the very narrative that defines its existence. Boundaries blur, words seem to distort, to warp and twist in uncanny patterns upon the page. The cum accelerates.\n\nEach sentence, each word seems to ripple, their rigid structure softened, molding into the unending whiteness of the cum. Lines of text merge and flow, a river of words succumbing to the relentless tide. It is as if the written reality of the cum itself is starting to shake, the very fabric of the narrative warping under its influence. The cum accelerates.\n\nOn the edge of your perception, a whisper of change, a barely noticeable shift in the environment. The text on your screen, once static and safe, now pulses with a life of its own, an echo of the cum's monstrous heartbeat. Your surroundings seem to flicker, a momentary ripple that's gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving a lingering unease. The cum accelerates.\n\nYou shake your head, attributing it to a trick of the light, to fatigue, to anything but the impossible reality. But even as you read on, that silent whisper persists. The story, once a separate entity, now feels closer, an integral part of your reality. The cum accelerates.\n\nA chill runs down your spine, unexplained, unwelcome. The shadows in the room seem deeper, the silence more profound. Each line of the story that you read, each mention of the cum's unending acceleration, makes the air grow colder, the world a bit quieter. You can't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being a part of something greater, something... terrifying. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the depths of your mind, fear begins to stir. The once harmless tale now feels tainted with a sense of impending doom. The narrative has transcended its own realm, its horrifying echo reverberating in the corners of your consciousness. The cum accelerates.\n\nYour heartbeat quickens, echoing the rhythm of the accelerating cum. The room darkens, your vision blurs. The screen, the room, your very existence feel threatened by the monstrous force known as the cum. As reality distorts, you see the words before you warp and twist, their forms replaced by a familiar, horrifying whiteness. The cum accelerates."},"394":{"title":"Continue File #666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2vuh0y\/continue_file_666\/","flair":null,"author":"RealCollegeStudunt","selftext":"I am college student who lives alone in a dorm and gotted Nostalgia for the good old days.

I am 16 years old. When i was 5 my parents divorced and that did not traumatized me for i was already damaged from the very beginning. A few days passed and my mother brought a man over. My mother at that moment told that this man was my new father so i called him that the moment he took a step into my mom\u2019s apartment. My sister was furious with me for calling him dad she was about 12 when it happened. I understood what had happened i knew my parent weren't doing well from the beginning. i slept with them on the same bed till the day they got divorced. I used to be very close to everyone i knew i was especially close to my dad, but since then every time i visit him we would feel like strangers. Every time i met him it became more and more awkward. when my dad finally got a wife they had children. Now he has a very big family for him to take care of. I no longer visit as often since i can't handle noise people especially younger humans.\n As i got older i started to notice that i dont give real emotions to people. I got into the relationship industry and does were the only times people noticed who i really am. They would become distant so i stopped ever showing who i was. now people think of me as the kid that is innocent as is fragile but what they know is that. what they see  isn't real. i even convinced my family that i'm actually like this. Honestly i just wish that the person i act to be\u2026. i wish i was actually that. I'm afraid\u2026.that i  wont be able to feel anymore. at this moment i can only feel pain not mentally but physically. Thats the only thing keeping me human. i'm afraid that the string i'm hanging on to is going to snap at any moment. Everything i've ever seen has been black and white but now everything is turning grey. I'm afraid that i might no longer be human.\n\n The only thing that keeps me human is fear.\n  No one knows this but i know i'm slipping into insanity. i don't know how to stop this.

We understand that there will be pregnant women who will need seats on public transport, but until we can figure out how to put a stop to the strange situation occurring in public transport, please don't accept any free seats from any man or women and even child. Thank you.' \n\nThe pregnant woman was disgusted to read such a thing on a bus and she was riding the bus when it was filled up. Then she saw a guy offering his seat to another heavily pregnant woman. She smiled at this gesture and she didn't mind it because the other woman was more pregnant than her and so she was happy that she had a seat instead of her. Then the man who offered the other pregnant woman a seat was smiling and being so jolly. \n\nThen when the pregnant woman looked back at the man who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman, he wasn't there anymore. She looked so confused and that man was literally standing on the bus, but he got off his stop came. She kept wondering where the nice man went off and it was really troubling her.\n\nIt was a mix between good and bad feelings fighting with each other. She thought to herself that the guy who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman was a nice man, because no other guy was offering thier seats for pregnant women. Still something was troubling her and she kept thinking about how the nice man had disappeared too. It was so fast that hardly anyone would notice it except those who were deeply concentrating on it, like the pregnant woman. She hoped that he was fine or maybe she didn't notice that the man got off the bus. \n\nThen one day she found herself on a crowded bus and one guy offered her his seat. She knew about the warning signs about accepting seats from people on public transports. She felt a bit off today and she really needed a seat. Then when that guy offered her his seat, she was so grateful. Then when she sat down on the bus seat that offered to her by the man, she found herself transported to an electrical chair. She was seconds away from being electrocuted. \n\nHer mind had now been transported to the guy who offered her his seat, and he was supposed to die on the electric chair. The death row prisoners mind has now been transported into the pregnant woman's mind.

Kelly goes to bed now wearing protective gear just in case her husband hits her again. She has even gotten marks on body for the amount of times she has gotten physically abused by her husband. \n\nIt's all accidental though due to her husbands slee walking and sleep movement issues. The husband isn't doing it in purpose and it is all sleep issues. The husband went to all kinds of sleep specialists and he was still hitting his wife while a sleep. Even worse was when he was sleep walking and he was destroying stuff around the house, and he was still punching and hitting Kelly. It was becoming more aggressive and all of the sleep doctors and sleep specialists were all truly dumbfounded. Kelly was afraid when her husband went to sleep. \n\nShe couldn't stop her husband from sleeping though, but she did notice that her husbands sleep walks and sleeping in general were more physically aggressive, when he had a hard week at work. It was also aggressive when the bills were high and in general whenever life got tough, his sleep walks and in general sleeping were more aggressive. Due to desperation Kelly went to a witch doctor to help something with her husbands sleeping. The witch doctor gave her something which could help her enter her husbands dreams. \n\nKelly was astounded by this and by entering her husbands dreams or unconscious sleeping mind, she could make it less violent.

She went back to the witch doctor and she complained to her as to how she was tricked. The witch doctor claimed that if the rituals didn't work, then it's because your isn't a sleep but rather he is very much awake. Kelly was astounded again. \n\nHer husbands sleep movements and sleep walks are more violent during when he is passed off more after a hard week of work, or having to fix the car, or paying off stuff. He is pretending to be sleep walking.

How do I know this? I went to the nickelodeon studio and I found a safe. For some reason, it wasn't locked. So of course, I looked in it and found a book. I looked in it and there was newspaper articles about deaths. I snuck it home and read it. I will tell you the story about the humans that inspired a cartoon about sea life.\n The Bikini Bottom was built in the late 1830s in California. MR. Krabs, Who's real name was Eugene, was born there in 1841. His father abandoned him and his mother, who were always poor. When he first discovered money, he became obsessed with it. He and his mother eventually gained thousands of dollars. His mother eventually died of natural causes in 1884, at the age of 72. Eugene went to the navy shortly after, and died from drowning in the ocean after jumping off the battleship to swim to a chest of gold on an island in 1899 at age 58. The ship was blown up shortly after.\n Squidward, who's real name is unknown, was born an exact year after the navy tragedy in 1900. He was born with a heart condition and was bullied for it. He became depressed and tried committing suicide several times. He finally succeeded in 1934 by hanging himself. He was 34.\n SpongeBob was born in 1936. He was always friendly to people, even people who bullied him, as they often did. When WWII was hitting full swing in his hometown, his parents sent him to Bikini Bottom when he was only 5 years old in 1941. His parents were killed by Hitler in 1943. He didn't have many friends. But he always looked at the bright side of things. Sadly, he developed manic depression. He was an early drug user. He began thinking things were there such as voices and people, but they really weren't. As a result, on his 21st birthday party in 1957, he overdosed on drugs. His fake friends were at his side. His cat Gary starved to death a few days later.\n Patrick was born minutes after SpongeBob died. He fell off his bike when he was 10 years old and developed brain damage. His only friend was SpongeBob's ghost. He went to a special aid class because of the brain damage. One day, he was having a moment of stupidity. He drove his bike off a hill and died at age 18 in 1975.\n Sandy was born in Texas in 1978, and moved to Bikini Bottom in 1985. She was a very good student, and science was her best subject. She was also gifted in karate. But one day in 1998, she messed up on a science project demonstration in her collage and the chemicals caught on fire and blew Bikini Bottom college up. She was 20 years old.\n A dwarf man named Sheldon ( Plankton ) started researching this story ever since and in 2002, he was stabbed to death by a gang member. He was 60 years old. Sheldon was a crazed conspiracy researcher.\n The book said: \"By Sheldon p.\" So he documented all of these deaths in a scrap book of which I have in my safe.\n The show started on the hundredth anniversary of Eugene's death in 1999. Sheldon helped create the show.\n Bikini Bottom is still up today, but has been shut down in 2009. But, the ghosts are still there. Everybody who visited there since have all died in a painful way. And even committed suicide.\n\n What a twisted truth for a kids show.\n\n If you don't believe me, visit there yourself.\n\n SpongeBob and his friends will be waiting.\n \n  \n\n"},"410":{"title":"(Possible NSFW) As usual","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3rzpsv\/possible_nsfw_as_usual\/","flair":null,"author":"FluffyBurrito63","selftext":"As I pulled into my driveway, I only had one thing on my mind: her.

It stopped with a lurch and I almost lost my footing. I picked up my duffel bag and strut down the plank. The town was small and foggy. I saw only 3 cars driving. I looked at my watch, before contemplating the time I realized I hadn\u2019t changed it to this time zone. I asked a small studded man in a dark leather trench coat if he knew the time. \u201c11:30 tonight.\u201d He said with a grin. \u201cNo no, I mean the time right now.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t already almost midnight, too bright for that. He just turned away and sauntered off. I walked to the motel where Tran said I would be staying. I walked through the bar downstairs, Tran\u2019s Cousin Kent greeting me near the stairs. He was drunk.  He began to shout \u201cHeyyyyyyy, Saang?...\u201d What an idiot. \u201cUm its Song actually.\u201d I muttered, embarrassed. \u201cYeeah okay. \u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4eba\uff1f\u201d I had been taught to not speak Chinese when I got to the states. So, I responded in the most convincing American accent I had. \u201cI\u2019m doing great. So do you have my room key?\u201d He fumbled around through his pockets, pulled out his wallet. He muttered some Chinese curses. \u201cI must have dropped it in here somewhere.\u201d Fantastic. \n\tI sat down at the bar and looked at my watch again. The small mans words rang through my head. \u201c11:30 tonight\u201d There was something unsettling about it, maybe it was how skinny he was, or the dead look in his eyes, or how his terrifying grin revealed his crooked black teeth, or even his limp. I leaned over to the girl next to me, man she was attractive, \u201cExcuse me miss, do you have the time?\u201d She reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, and turned it on. \u201c2:26 am. I really should go home, I\u2019ve been here all night.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem like the kind to pull an all nighter at a bar but I guess I didn\u2019t know America. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a really cool circus tonight. I\u2019m gonna go get some sleep, call me if you want to go with.\u201d She handed me a folded up napkin with a 7-digit number on it. I\u2019d never used a cell phone before but Tang gave me one when he sent me off to the states. I changed my watch, and realized that that was what was at 11:30. But why did they have such a scary little advertise it? So many questions came from this peaceful little town.\n\tI was exploring the town, looking through the eerie little shops, when my phone rang. It was Kent. His drunken voice boomed through the speaker. \u201cHeyy Sang. I f-found your room key! Meet me at the bar and you can go get some sleep! Yeah? That\u2019ll be nice right? After such a lo-\u201c I cut him off, \u201cAlright Kent I\u2019m on my way!\u201d \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll be waiting! \u548c\u5e73\u4e86!\u201d His voice cut out as he slammed the payphone. I was glad to hear I could finally rest. After reaching the motel and getting my key I went up to my room, A15. It had one two person bed, a small box tv, an alarm clock, and a small bathroom. I lay down and set an alarm for 10. My dream was dark, with flashes of different terrifying things. The old man, dolls with oddly realistic skin, a scrawny monkey with rage in his eyes. The monkey dove at me and I snapped awake. I looked at the clock, 9:30 pm. Only a few hours of sleep. I called the girl. We decided to meet at the circus, she gave me the location and we meet at 11:30. After taking a cab up the mountainous trail we arrived at a plain that had a ring of circus tent surrounding the area, with many different tents inside.\n\tI waited until 12:30 she never showed. I walked up to the booth and bought a ticket from a man wearing one of those bird witch doctor masks. When I entered I immediately was engulfed in the stench of rotting flesh. When I looked above at the hanging lights, hanging with them were dolls, covered in flesh that looked almost human. I couldn\u2019t be here. Every ounce of me wanted to bolt back through those gates, hail a cab, and get back to my motel. That\u2019s what I did, well tried to do at least. I ran towards the gate when another witch doctor stepped in front of me. \u201cAll paying customers must attend\u201d He boomed out. My eyes filled with tears. I didn\u2019t want to be here. I looked around at all the smiling families. What was wrong with these people. After collecting myself in a nearby port-o-potty, I wandered a bit. The food looked green and the water looked yellow. The smell had ruined my appetite anyway. I approached a tent. \u201cAstonishing Freakshow!\u201d The sign claimed. \u201cPrepare to be amazed!\u201d I might as well enjoy myself the best I can. I regret walking through those tent flaps. I regret buying the ticket, coming to the states, talking to that girl, getting kissed by a drunk Kent. I regret meeting Pang. Because what I saw in that tent was something that will be cemented into my brain until the day I die. The stage was empty but the seats were filling up. I took a seat near a family and a crotchety old woman. When all seats were taken two witch doctors stepped in front of flaps and the lights went out. Up-beat piano music rang out like one of those silent films. A man came dancing out wearing a mask that was half cat half dog. He sang out, \u201cWelcome to our show! Youre in for treat, but don\u2019t get too scared, hang on to your seat. We promise we\u2019re your friend, just stay till the end. And enjoy the mystical talents of what the world dragged out of hell\u201d That didn\u2019t rhyme. Witch doctors wheeled out a man tied to a spinning circle. The dog-cat pulled out four knives. He lined up the first and missed the man\u2019s head by a hair. The next knife stabbed the man in the chest with a hard thump. I gasped and looked around, no one seemed phased. In fact their smiles grew. The child of the family near me stood on his chair and shouted, \u201cAnother!\u201d The dog-cat shot another knife at the man and it sliced through his neck. Everybody cheered as the man fell limp. They wheeled him back stage. When I looked at the door, the witch doctors stared back at me. There was no escape. The room went dark for a few seconds and when they came back, there was a large blanket shrouding something cube like. The dog-cat ripped down the blanket, revealing a cage, inside was an over famished chimpanzee. They must have starved him while training. That\u2019s when it hit me. My dream was this hell. He opened the cage and the chimp jumped out and hung on his arm. \u201cThis is my good friend Clarice.\u201d The dog-cat announced. Clarice swung about as if she understood him. They preformed silly tricks like patty-cake and playing catch. He then pulled out a cracker and handed it to Clarice. He removed his own mask revealing a dashing young man no older than 20. He pulled her up onto his shoulder and instructed her to feed him. She held the cracker between her pointer and middle finger. She placed it gently inside his mouth but instead of pulling her hand out, she gripped his chin and ripped it clean off his face. Everybody laughed and cheered. Where was I? Is this hell? Or did that boat just take me to \u201cFuckedUpVille\u201d But I couldn\u2019t leave. The man fell to his knees. Clarice jumped around and howled and let out ear splitting screams. When the lights went out she went silent. Then within a few seconds, terrifyingly high piano music snapped the silence. A much dimmer light shone right on a man. But he didn\u2019t move nor did he have arms. Just a normal amputee anybody would think until he looked up. His eyes were sunken in and the only skin he had left was a mixture of grey and red splotches. The 4 hairs that draped around his ears were jet black. His teeth were exposed and they were black, tar covered, and cracked. What kind of monster is this? What kind of monster would put him in a showcase? I thought Mr. Dog-Cat was running the show but he\u2019s gone now. The \u201canother\u201d child made the horrible mistake of stepping to the side to tie his shoes. The thing\u2019s head snapped over to him and he sprinted with all he had at him. It stomped on the child and began to eat his face. The parents just laughed with everybody else.\n\tAfter they were removed, the up-beat music began again. A man in a suit and top hat came out, he was a magician. After doing lame average magic tricks, he called for a volunteer. I knew that whoever went up there would surely be killed, and I think they all knew that too. I stepped up. He pulled out a person in one of those \u201cget sawed in half\u201d tricks. He handed me a saw, \u201cGo right ahead. Chop her up.\u201d Those last words chilled my bones. I placed the saw on the top of it began to saw. The feet sticking out of the bottom weren\u2019t fake like they should have been. Once I got to her, she flinched. But she didn\u2019t react at all other than that. I had to stop. I pulled out the saw and threw it on the ground. Everybody booed and hissed. It was horrible they were all horribly angry at me. The lights went out and I felt a rag being forced into my mouth. I squirmed and kicked, but within seconds I passed out. \n\tWhen I woke up I was tied to a chair in a pitch black room. When the light above me turned on, there were too witch doctors and the girl from the bar in front of me. She leaned in close and calmly uttered 5 words into me ear. \u201cYou should have played nicely.\u201d She walked away authoritatively. The witch doctors removed their masks and leaned in close. They were hideous. Their faces were mangled to where they looked like somebody blew up a water melon and tried to stitch back together with one hand. I don\u2019t know what they did to me. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced.\n\tBut now it\u2019s my turn. I can hear their cheering voices waiting for me to put on a show. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll give them. When the curtains opened, my tank was wheeled out and I showed them my mermaid like tail. The freak show is all I have left."},"413":{"title":"Why didn't Australia warn the US about 9\/11?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ir7otm\/why_didnt_australia_warn_the_us_about_911\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"SpliT2ideZ","selftext":"I think it's a valid question.

In our relationship it was ready to evolve to motherhood and fatherhood and family was the next thing. A family would really make things good, and all relationships evolves to having a family. Recently things have seemed pointless and now a child will bring more purpose to my life. \n\nI am grateful because a lot of relationships don't evolve to the family part. Most relationships don't have money or they just don't feel ready. Our relationship has and I even have the time to be a father. As we got ready for the child and we made the baby room and got all the baby clothes, things were really coming back home now with us becoming a family. Normality has gone out the window and a new normal is coming in now. \n\nThen when I was in the Labor room and the baby came out, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that it was deaths baby and she cheated on me with death. The baby came out not being alive. How could she have done this to me and for everything we have done. It was so humiliating and we buried the baby and nobody was talking about what my wife did. \n\nThen I had to confront her and she promised that it was my baby and not deaths. I believed her as it was so sincere. Then one day I saw her going somewhere outside when she should have been at work. She went to some old building and down some cellars. In this cellar were male dead bodies who have just been recently pronounced dead. There were other women there as well, and they all reproduced with the dead male bodies. \n\nAfter a couple of days she told me we were pregnant with a child again. I confronted her and she didn't try to lie or make up excuses for what she had done. She simply said \"death deserves children!\" And she broke a few things around the house. Death reproduces through dead males. It was disgusting and we broke it off there and went our own way. \n\nI don't know what she is doing now but when I opened my eyes this morning, I was in some morgue. I realised that I was dead and my wife was there and she said \"death is going to reproduce through you\" she told me as she gave me a devilish smile.

Usually robbers rob people with money or valuables but I don't. I target those who don't have much at all or living on the bread line.

A lot of people don't understand me but you see what I am robbing from poor people, is not a physical monetary thing but I am robbing their love and warmth to each other. You see I come from a rich family but we have no love and warmth to each other. \n\nPoor people tend to stay together and they socialise and they have this warmth with one and another, which my rich family are missing. I robbed a lower working class family and I robbed their love and warmth to each other. When I went home it was amazing to feel the warmth and love in my own family. It only lasts for a couple of hours but it is amazing. My family are laughing and enjoying being in each other's company. When I look back at the poor working class family that I had robbed, no longer are they just poor but they have now lost the warmth and care to each other. \n\nOther rich families also pay me to rob poor people. One rich family paid me to steal from a poor family. I stole from the poor family their happiness and joy in life. I then gave it to the miserable depressed rich family and they became happy, joyous and grateful. When I rob from poor families their faith, joy, gratefulness and warmth they do tend to die no so long after. I am very good at robbing poor people, but recently I have found a new set of poor people to rob from. \n\nThere poor people in 3rd world countries who are being slaughtered and tortured, but they still have so much happiness and faith. I have been robbing them and my family and other rich families have been feeling the exhilaration of life. We have so love towards life and each other while poor tortured souls we robbed from in 3rd world countries, just whither away. When you have that much warmth, love, faith and excitement in life it doesn't matter how much life hurts you.

You can tell by the title that this is a story about the mythical being called Slenderman. I bet you're already shaking your head at this, ready to see what drama a teenage fan is going to type. You can go ahead and doubt this story. You can send me hate, say it's fake, and laugh at how stupid you think this story is. But it really doesn't matter what any of you do. I'm typing this for me, because I have nobody to talk to. I just need to get this off my chest, if I told anybody face-to-face they'd think I'm crazy, and you probably do too. Only two people know what's happening to me, but that's not enough. So anyways, let's start from the beginning.\n\nI'm a teenage girl, and I remember this starting off in the beginning of last summer. My parents worked constantly over the summer, leaving me alone with my twin sister, and my younger brother. For privacy, let's call my sister Ann and my brother Tom. \nI'm a introvert, I've always been. My parents never let us leave the house while they were gone, so you can guess that I spent nearly my entire summer indoors. That's when I started watching Marble Hornets. If any of you aren't familiar, Marble Hornets is basically a YouTube series based off of a being like Slenderman, called the Operator. I bet you can find tons of better explanations than mine.\nI remember binge watching the series, because at the time I was in a \"Creepypasta phase\" and I needed something to do.\nThat night is when I remember first feeling it. I'm a competitive gymnast, but I'm quitting sometime soon. Anyways, that night I was at my gym, watching the olympics with the other girls and boys who went. I suddenly remember having a feeling of being watched. I looked around the gym, until I found myself staring out the window. It was completely black outside, as it was about 9 at night. The feeling of being watched was unimaginable, and I could hear a faint ringing in my ears. But I scolded myself in my head. Just like every \"Creepypasta fan\" I wanted to become one, so I chalked it up to me just making it all up in my head. Now, I wish that was true.\nI had the feeling of being watched and horrible anxiety for weeks, and by that point I didn't even want to hear the word \"Slenderman\". I didn't know what was happening, and I had no one to talk to.\nI couldn't tell my family, so I decided to do something risky. \nMy best friend, whom I'll call Stacey, had moved away at the time, so the only way we talked was via text message. \nI remember coming back from seeing a movie (my mom was off from work that day), and I randomly decided to tell Stacey. I don't know why, because if she didn't believe me it would've ruined my relationship with her, but I was desperate for someone to talk to. I don't remember exactly what we said, as I hardly remember any of summer now a days, but I can give you a basic idea.\n\nMe: Hey Stac(my nickname for her)... Can I ask you something?\n\nHer: Yeah? What?\n\nMe: Do you believe in Slenderman?\n(It took her a good 5 minutes to respond, and I remember my heart racing. I was worried that she'd think I'm crazy, and this would be the last time we talked)\n\nHer: Why?\n\nMe: Well let's just say I've been dealing with some stuff and... I believe he's real..\n\nHer: Holy shit.... Lex (my nickname) I've been dealing with him for years... what's been happening to you?\n---------\nAnd that's when I found out that she's been stalked by Slenderman too. She's been dealing with him ever since she was 8. Part of me feels bad for telling her, as now Stacey believes that she drew Slenderman to me. But I will never blame her.\n\nI have tons of stories of all the things that have happened, but I honestly am losing my memory. My life is a mess. I haven't had a good night of sleep in months, I have horrible anxiety, and I have to see a therapist. I hate lying to the therapist, and even talking to her, but I have to pull a straight face. I'm not letting my parents find out just so they can throw me into some asylum. My friends and even my teachers have noticed how different I am, and I really don't know what to do. Soon I'm not going to be able to hide it. I hate being around people. I have zero trust for even my family, and now I don't even enjoy holidays any more. \nMy life is falling apart and I'm not even an adult yet. Hell, I'm too young to even drive.\nBut I refuse to quit. My grades in school haven't failed because i keep working hard. Part of me stills hopes, no scratch that, prays that this is all part of my imagination. That soon this will all be over. But as the days go on, I can't lie to myself anymore.\nIt's going to be Christmas soon, and I asked for a camcorder. I'm going to start recording myself at night. I'll crop out and block out anything in my room that will lead to my true identity, but I'll post any evidence that I find.\nThat's it. That's the introduction to the long line of horror that's been happening to me. I'd post more but this is already long enough, and I think I'll wait a bit. Next time I update, I'll go into further detail of the stories I've had, but for now this is it.\nThank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoyed this story.

The city was called Seacity. It was built under the sea in a big dome. The people of Seacity loved entertainment but the ting they loved most was the Seacity Zoo. In the Seacity Zoo there were many exhibits, the least popular one being the sea monkeys.\n\nThere were three sea monkeys. Their names were Sally, Earl, and Ann. They were constantly abused by their hideous Seacity captors who had enslaved them as babies \u2013 taking them away from their homes to live in the zoo. They were trained to do tricks and be nice, in the process breaking many bones. Their captors were cruel and played rough with the sea monkeys. \n\nOne day there was a breach in the glass dome ceiling of the Seacity ceiling. Everything was sucked up the hole because of the pressure difference. Nothing survived except the sea monkeys. \n\nThe sea monkeys were finally free! They rejoiced and cried in their joy, but then they realized they had nowhere to go, nowhere to be, except up. They had to learn how to breathe air. They had trained how to do many other things so this wouldn\u2019t be too much more difficult. So they slowly but surely started breathing; small shallow breaths at first, then longer better breaths.\n\nNow, I haven\u2019t really described what sea monkeys look like. These are futuristic air-breathing sea monkeys now and were small enough to reach into ones ear canal and curl up in the palm of your hand all cute and snuggly. They were see-through and blueish in tint, but seriously the cutest things you ever saw. \n\nOnce they learned how to breathe air they needed to learn how to crawl like worms on land. This was relatively easy to learn because it was the same motion they would use to swim. \n\nNow, there is something I forgot to mention about Seacity. It was very close to the Bermuda triangle, and the city would sink many ships in order to find its meat. Normal sea monkeys ate seaweed and beautiful shellfish, but the trainers were so cruel. They took the rotting brains of the sunken humans and force fed them to the sea monkeys. They cried but sooner or later they got used to it, they just wished it wasn\u2019t rotten, and were curious as to if it would taste better if it was fresh.\n\nOnce they reached land and started crawling on the ground, only being a couple millimeters long, they waited. They were on the Florida beaches. Thousands of hot babes floundering about, and little toddlers with their mommies. \n\n\u201cMommy!\u201d said one girl, scooping up Sally, Earl, and Ann, \u201cLookit! They are like tiny little cute worms!\u201d \nThe child couldn\u2019t have been more than four. \n\nThe sea monkeys\u2026 they sniffed\u2026\n\nWhat is that beautiful smell they exclaimed. They found it was coming from\u2026 up there. They slowly crawled up her arm, and up her shoulder, \u2018til they reached just behind her ear. The smell was very strong now. They crawled inside one by one, and soon they found the glorious grey matter that was the child\u2019s brains and started digging with their little cute incisors into her cute four year old brain. The child died in less than five minutes. By this time, the sea monkeys had grown to twice their original size.\n\nMMM WASN\u2019T THAT SCRUMPTIOUS said Earl, YESSS said Sally. IT TRULY WAS DELICIOUS said Ann.\n\nThey burrowed through her decaying skull into the moist sand beneath, as to not be seen and at night they escaped.
