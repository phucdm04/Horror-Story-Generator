And truthfully, I don’t think I ever will.\n\nSix years ago, I died in the stupidest way possible.\n\nThere’s a lake of sorts located in the outskirts of my town. The day that I died was a particularly chilly day, so the lake was frozen solid. My two best friends (who I now refuse to talk to) dared me to walk across the frozen lake. Doing so would result in them paying me a hefty amount of forty dollars. I was twelve at the time, so you know damn well that I didn’t think twice about this.\n\nSo, there I was right after school. Walking across the frozen lake. Truth be told, it didn’t seem like a bad idea at the time. Walking on the ice felt like walking on concrete. Then again, my friends were cheering me on the whole time, so I really couldn’t hear the cracks that came from the ice.\n\nYou can imagine how mortified I was when the ice collapsed.\n\nMy heart stopped due to the sudden drop in temperature. And in that moment, the world faded away into the brightest shade of white. Just pure white. I tried holding my hands up to my face, but I couldn’t do so at all. In fact, I wasn’t even inside my body at all. As the spiritual people say, all that was left of me was a big ball of light known as ‘my soul’.\n\n“You’re here early.” A voice muttered.\n\nWho this voice belonged to, I’ll never know. Was it God? Eh, I doubt it. Was it an angel? Mmm, maybe. But irregardless, this voice was deep and commanding, echoing throughout the entire void. It came from everywhere yet nowhere at the same time.\n\n“Who are you?” I gasped.\n\n“Oh, I really shouldn’t say,” The Voice spoke. “See, you’re here about a few decades early. But that’s okay. That’s fine. Because fourteen minutes and twenty one seconds from now, a cocky ER doctor will bring you back to life. Your mother will hold you in her arms, and your father will cry for the first time in over fifteen years. Your friends will visit you in the hospital, but you won’t really want them there. No! You’ll just curse them out for three minutes straight. You won’t go back to school until next Wednesday, and when you do go back, your biology teacher will give you a very nice box of chocolates. Very nice indeed.”\n\nThe Voice spoke as if these events had already occurred.\n\n“How do you know all of this?” I asked.\n\n“Because I planned all of it,” The Voice answered. “I planned for you to wear Nike sneakers today, and I planned for you to grow an interest in The Olympics. You’re a very good athlete right now, so I can already see that that decision has paid off very well.”\n\n“So, you planned out every part of my life?” I stuttered.\n\n“Even the parts that you don’t think about.” The voice answered.\n\n“So you planned out every argument that I’ve had with my mom?” I asked, horrified.\n\n“And I planned out every insult that you called her.” The Voice answered.\n\n“And you also planned out who I would be friends with?” I asked, angrily.\n\n“Yep.”\n\n‘Shocked’ is a very subtle way of describing how I felt. But as The Voice continued to speak, I couldn’t help but think of just one more question.\n\n“Well,” I said. “If I’m not going to die today, then what’s going to happen when I actually die?”\n\n“Oh, when you *actually* die?” The Voice asked. “Well, the answer is actually quite simple. You’ll be reincarnated as yourself, born in the same year and everything, and I’ll just change another decision of yours. Maybe instead of planning for you to grow an interest in The Olympics, I’ll have you grow an interest in Charles Dickens. Or maybe I’ll have you grow an interest in The Titanic. Or maybe I won’t even change that. Maybe I’ll change where you sat on your first day of Kindergarten. Or maybe I’ll change what bus route you use to go to work.”\n\nBus routes? Charles Dickens? Kindergarten? Seriously?\n\n“Why does that even matter?” I asked.\n\n“Because it all impacts your future.” The Voice bellowed. “In your previous life, you chose to oversleep on a Sunday morning, which caused you to miss a flight that ended up crashing into the ocean. In the life before that, you woke up right on time. And in the life before that, you never even had to go on any flight, because I chose for you to have aerophobia.”\n\n“Every decision counts.” The Voice concluded.\n\nAnd the shade of bright white faded away, allowing me to watch my father as he uncontrollably cried.\n\n"},"3":{"title":"They said my little brother must have drowned in the cave.  The uncertainty always ate at me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh0mc7\/they_said_my_little_brother_must_have_drowned_in\/","flair":null,"author":"Kinkajou_Incarnate","selftext":"There was a story about it in the paper.  People at church offered their condolences, kids at school that I never talked to would give me sideways glances. When a five year old gets washed into a cave, and there is a two-week search, it tends to get attention.\n\nI never wanted condolences.  I wanted closure.  Even if he was dead, I needed to see his body.  The thought that he could have died down there, alone and in the dark, was unacceptable to me.\n\nWhen they stopped searching after two weeks, my only thought was that it would take someone longer than that to starve to death.  There was plenty of water down there; if he had been washed into an inaccessible part of the cave, then he could still be alive.  My dad had to physically keep me from trying to go back into the cave myself, to tell me that it was over, that he was gone.  In my heart, I didn’t believe he was dead.\n\nI was sixteen at the time, a junior in high school.  Kieran had been an oops baby, eleven years younger than me.  He was the sweetest kid, even though he was insane.  At age four, he’d broken a leg and an arm falling about thirty feet out of a tree he had managed to climb.  He was always running around climbing and jumping off of things, yelling and laughing.\n\nHe probably had ADHD in retrospect, but at the time he annoyed the shit out of me.  I would try to do homework, and he would basically whirlwind into my room like the tasmanian devil from the cartoons, jumping on the bed and tackling me.  He wanted a big brother, but the age gap made it hard for us to bond.  Any of my spare time after marching band and homework was spent trying (unsuccessfully) to get a girlfriend, and I didn’t treat him the way I should have.\n\nTwo years later, after a lot of therapy, I’ve stopped blaming myself as much.  I know that it was natural to act the way I did, to feel the way I did.  That even if he annoyed me, it didn’t mean I didn’t love him, deeply.  I know that I did.  I know that I still do.\n\nWhen I went to UT for college, I met a couple people who were into spelunking.  They didn’t know about my brother, and I never told them.  I couldn’t bring myself to tell my parents, knowing what they would think.  But I picked it up fast, with a conviction that I knew was illogical.  I wanted to find his body, or find him.\n\nIt was denial, I knew that much.  But I had nightmares about him, nightmares that he was in that cave, in the dark screaming my name, but I couldn’t find him.  After nearly three years, they never stopped.  My therapist had a whole bunch of thoughts on the matter, as did my parents.  But I knew what would give me peace, in a way that nothing else could: finding his body.\n\nPartway through my freshman year, an opportunity presented itself.  Kieran had fallen into a creek that went underground.  Since then, we had had record drought, and the creek was nearly dry.  More than two years before, the team had explored everything they could, but the path of the water was not navigable.  It was a tunnel completely filled with a fast current, too dangerous to try and send anyone down even with scuba gear.\n\nI needed to see what it looked like now.  I should have told someone I was doing it, even just my friends that taught me caving.  Instead, I drove back to my parents neighborhood, took a dirt road into the forest, parked my car, and went back to the cave.\n\nFor anyone not from that part of the country, it’s all limestone.  Water eats through it easily, and there are caves everywhere.  Most of them aren’t as deep as this particular, but it’s normal if you have a few acres of land to have a cave on it.  This particular one was in a gully a couple hundred yards from the house I grew up in.\n\nGetting my gear out of the trunk, I walked through the familiar hickory and maples, feet crunching on the dry leaves, down the rocky hill to the creek.\n\nThe mouth of the cave was small, only about two feet high and three feet wide.  I could still picture the yellow tape, the police officers directing volunteer search parties day and night. Standing there in the quiet forest, I stared at that black opening, as I had so many times.  Even though the cave was significant, they’d already explored everything they could, mapped it thoroughly.\n\nThe water didn’t even go over the top of the rocks in the bottom of it as I crawled through without getting wet, besides a little mud.  I had the cave maps they made memorized, but still carried a laminated copy.  Following the weak trickle of water, I crawled a little ways, until the ceiling got high enough to walk if you kept your head down.  All I had to do was follow the water about one hundred feet, then see if the tunnel was clear.  That was the only way his body could be.\n\nIt smelled earthy, with decaying leaves in the weak flow.  Looking back over my shoulder, I turned a bend and saw the last bit of reflected sunlight fade out of existence, leaving only my headlamp.  Watching my step on the slick muddy rock, a little salamander wriggled out of the way through the silty water.\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest as I made my way deeper into the earth, seeing how little water there was.  Every inch of the cave had been checked, except for where I was headed.  If the passage was clear, I would be the first person to ever go into that part of the cave.  Well, the second.\n\nThe black hole was shaped like an oval, a little over a foot tall and about two feet wide.  One to two inches of water ran down the bottom of it.  A knot formed in my throat, half feeling like I would cry and half feeling like I was scared.  I knew that I should get someone else, but I couldn’t stand thinking about what they would say.  They would say there was no point, that the body would be washed too deep or buried, and that it could be too dangerous, and to let a professional do it.\n\nInstead of getting help, I began to drill.  The rock was all limestone, and it didn’t take too long to get two secure bolts drilled to anchor my rope.  I put on my harness, and got onto my stomach.  It’s hard to tell just how steep slopes are in a cave, but the water gave me a good idea.  I would be squeezing through this hole, and essentially repelling down.\n\nLooking in with my headlamp, it seemed like the top was a narrow point, and that it might open up.  I’d never done anything this tight and steep with water in it, but something pushed me into that black opening, where I could hear water falling far below: night after night of dreaming Kieran was down there alone, screaming, terrified.\n\nIt was a tight squeeze, tighter than I liked.  To repel, I had to have my face down toward the water, and turn my head so that I could breathe.  I inched down, struggling to use the equipment in the tight space.  Progress was painfully slow, as I had to try and turn myself onto my left hip to reach the ATC scraping into the rock on my stomach.\n\nGetting out wouldn’t be any easier.\n\nThe rock pressed in on me, harder and harder as the angle got steeper and steeper.  I was essentially in a tiny tube with a waterfall, going more and more vertical.  My problem was that the tube was not equally wide in all places; it was carved by water, and would get narrower or wider on whims that I couldn’t predict.  I’d heard horror stories of Nutty Putty cave, where the caver got stuck in a vertical shaft like this one, and it didn’t help.\n\nI was coming up on the narrowest part yet, but it looked like it would open up below that.  I’d taken my helmet off, so that I could squeeze through better.  In the tight space with the water splashing my face and running through my shirt and pants, I began to feel fear.\n\nNot fear like you feel standing near a ledge; that’s a manageable type of fear you can step back from.  Not a fear that you feel in the pitch black, unsure of what’s around you; you can just find a light.\n\nThis was a fear beyond that.  A fear that each foot of vertical rock builds incrementally inside of you, as you know your escape becomes harder and harder.  A fear that each pound of pressure as the rock smashes into your chest so that you can’t breathe increases.  A fear that right here, right now, if you panic, you will die.\n\nI promised myself that my parents wouldn’t lose two sons to this cave.  That if it got any tighter, any steeper, I would turn around.\n\nJust before my will broke, my chest scraped through a tight spot, and the tunnel began to open.  I almost dropped by helmet down the shaft, but managed to put it back on.  From the sound of the water falling, I could tell I was entering a large chamber.\n\nShining my light around, there was a domed ceiling with a few small stalactites.  A huge, murky pool of water was below me, and I couldn’t see how deep it was.  Large rocks were piled around the edges, and it seemed like the water was shallower on the other side.  I repelled down, until my feet hit the water.  They just kept going down, and down, until I was chest deep and stopped feeding rope.  There was no way to know how deep the pool was, but I knew I would have to swim.\n\nThe rope was my lifeline, and I couldn’t leave it.  I did an awkward sidestroke, pulling with one arm and trying to feed out rope with the other underwater.  I’d never tried it before, and I wouldn’t recommend it.  It sort of felt like I was going to drown, the weight of my clothes and shoes and the rope making it nearly impossible.  Eventually, I made it thirty or so feet away from the waterfall, and felt my boots start to sink into silty mud.\n\nDrenched and breathing hard, I found a rock to sit on.  I felt as if I might throw up from the exertion, now that the adrenaline was wearing off.\n\nA new sort of dread filled me as I looked around.\n\nThis wasn’t a small cave system, and I could hear the water going even deeper.  I couldn’t be sure, but it looked like there were other tunnels, made by other water sources meeting up with this one.  Should I follow the main current, as that was likely where Kieran’s body would have gone?  Or should I try to thoroughly map every tunnel I could find, branching off of this chamber?\n\nThe memory of his loss was fresh in my mind, but it had been almost three years.  What would I be looking for, what would be left of his body?  Scraps of clothing or bones.  Regardless of what my dreams told me, what else could there be?\n\nI had decided to take a few minutes to rest, to gather my thoughts.  Rushing things wouldn’t help.  The sound of water was a white noise, and I began to look around more calmly.  I noticed a pale little fish swimming in the murky pool in front of me.\n\nAll I can remember was a loud cracking sound.\n\nThank God I was wearing my helmet, or I would have been dead.  It’s strange how when you get hit on the head, you can lose your sight and sense of balance, but still hear things.  I was shocked, but knew that I must have a concussion.  There’s no way for me to know if I was unconscious for a second, or a minute, but I tried to scramble back to my feet in a panic.\n\nA rock had struck me, from above.  It must have come off of the steep side of the chamber, from a hidden ledge.  My leg was hurt, I could tell that much.  There was a sharp, pulsing pain on my calf that I’d never felt; it was bad.  I kicked my leg by reflex, only realizing consciously what my instincts had already figured out, only seeing the impossible as my dazed head turned around, and a scream escaped my mouth.\n\nHe was eating me.\n\nThe emaciated boy was pale as death, bloody teeth digging into my leg.  Blind eyes were wide open, deep in their sockets, above sunken cheeks.  Over and over he bit me, with a hunger I could never understand.  His arms were smaller than my wrists, his collar bones sticking from his chest.  I grabbed his shoulder, and threw him off of me in terror.  He couldn’t have weighed thirty pounds.\n\nFor a second I saw him stand, my blood dripping from his mouth and over the ribs of his chest, before he ran into the darkness.\n\n“Kieran!”\n\nI screamed his name at the top of my lungs, went to chase him.  Still confused from the head trauma, I was yanked backwards by the rope still attached to my harness.  I frantically unlocked the carabiner, and ran the way he had gone, ignoring the pain in my leg.  Drops of black blood lead me to a low, narrow tunnel.\n\nIn my headlamp, I saw his little feet disappearing around a corner.  The crack he had squeezed through was impossibly small, I could never fit into it.\n\n“Kieran, it’s me!  It’s Chris!  It’s me!”\n\nI began sobbing.  Why couldn’t I have grabbed him?  If I’d just grabbed one of those tiny arms I could have hugged him, told him I loved him, brought him back to the sun.\n\n“Mom and Dad love you, they miss you.  I miss you!”  I yelled over the sound of the waterfall.\n\nI kept saying anything I could think of.  I said that I had food; tried to wrinkle the wrapper of a granola bar as loudly as I could.  Told him that he could go home, screamed until I collapsed on the wet rock.\n\nIn my mind, the last almost three years had been hard; what were they for him, alone in the dark, eating anything that swam or crawled he could get his hands on?  He was only five at the time, and would be almost eight now.  Would he be insane?  Remember who I was, or even who he himself was?\n\nLooking down, a trickle of blood went into the main pool, dying it a dark color at the edge.  I was bleeding, a lot.  If I didn’t stop it, I wouldn’t make the climb back up, and no one would know that either of us was down here.\n\nWrapping the leg as tightly as I could, it kept bleeding.  I didn’t really have the tools to make a proper tourniquet, but tightened the knot as hard as I could, until I screamed.  Before I went, I left the granola bar unwrapped at the base of the crack Kieran had gone through, along with a spare headlamp turned on to the lowest setting.  I screamed that I would be back, promised him, before eventually turning back to the pool.\n\nI pulled myself along the rope to the base of the waterfall.  Painfully, I made my way back up it, and somehow squeezed through the crack.  I barely remember, to be honest, just the suffering of it, and wanting to give up.\n\nI didn’t give up though.  Half for myself, and half for Kieran.\n\nAt the mouth of the cave, I collapsed.  Seeing the sun brought me to my senses just a little.  I called my mom, and she answered.  I told her I was at the cave, out back, that I was hurt.  That I had found Kieran.  I told her to call an ambulance.\n\nThe leg is okay.  I will be able to use it just fine, even though the scar will never heal.  There was too much tissue missing.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctors agreed that the injury on my leg was from being bitten, probably by a child based on the tooth marks.  That fact alone was the only reason I could convince anyone that he was still down there, still alive.  It seemed impossible, but he must have been eating the fish, or anything else he could find.\n\nThey sent down a search party, but no one can fit into a lot of the tunnels he might have gone down.\n\nMy parents are a wreck, understandably.  Even three days later, my dad is hysterical and my mom is just quiet.  They wanted to go down, to try and talk to him, but there’s no way they would make the climb.  I barely did.\n\nThe rescue teams couldn’t find him, and the tunnel is completely impassable to anyone other than a starved child.  No one has seen him, but they put food in the crack I last saw him in, and when they came back the next day, it was gone.\n\nI never gave up on him, and I still haven’t.  Right now the plan is to leave as much food as we can, and hope that the rain forecast tomorrow isn’t enough to fill the cave.\n\n  \n[…more](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/patrickmullensauthor\/s\/qEF252JtVs)"},"4":{"title":"My neighbor hasn’t aged a day in the 15 years I’ve lived here — and now he’s started leaving me notes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khcq4j\/my_neighbor_hasnt_aged_a_day_in_the_15_years_ive\/","flair":"Series","author":"OriginsOfEvil666","selftext":"My neighbor hasn’t aged a day in the 15 years I’ve lived here — and now he’s started leaving me notes\n\nI moved into this street when I was 22. Fresh out of university, excited and broke, I found a small two-bed rental that let me cobble together a life with cheap pizza and late-night coding sprints. Nobody really talked about the guy across the road—he was quiet, curtains always drawn, lawn trimmed to perfection. I assumed he worked weird hours and just kept to himself.\n\nFast forward to now: I’m 37, with a receding hairline, an achy back, and a half-empty bottle of anti-wrinkle cream on my dresser. My friends joke I’ve aged like milk. Yet every time I cross the street to grab my mail, I catch his reflection in his window: same hair, same posture, same bored expression. No gray. No wrinkles. No sign he’s even turned a single birthday candle.\n\nLast week, I finally noticed his lawn was exactly the same height as it was when I moved in—all fifteen years of clippings gone. It was too consistent to be a coincidence. The street sweeper never caught him working, and I never saw a lawnmower. He just… existed, day in, day out, untouched by time.\n\nI tried to shrug it off. Probably some weird glitch in my head. But Thursday night, I came back from a late dinner with friends and saw something stuck to my front door: a small, pale yellow sticky note. Scripted in neat block letters:\n\n> “You’re starting to notice. Don’t.”\n\nNo signature. No duck tape—just slapped on like someone was in a hurry. I stared at it for a full minute before ripping it off and tossing it in my bin. My heart thumped so loud I was sure the neighbors heard.\n\nSaturday morning, I peeked through my blinds before heading out. His curtains were half-open. I thought about marching across and demanding answers, but every time I tried, something pulled me back. That afternoon, I was at my desk when my phone lit up with a notification: another note, this time stuck to my car windshield.\n\n> “You’ll want to ignore this. But you can’t. That’s how it starts.”\n\nThe handwriting was the same—no flourish, no personality. Just instructions. My palms sweated. It wasn’t a prank; I don’t know anyone who’d go to this trouble. I rubbed my eyes and wondered if my brain had finally had enough sleep deprivation from late-night work.\n\nToday—I’ve barely eaten. I noticed his porch light flicked on at noon. I stared at it for ten minutes, convinced it would turn off, but it stayed lit. When I finally looked away, I saw him standing at his window, watching me. Not waving. Not talking on the phone. Just… watching, like he’d been waiting for me to catch him in the act.\n\nI tried calling a friend to talk it through, but my words came out jumbled. How do you explain your unaging neighbor sending you cryptic threats and staring at you all day? I even checked my ring doorbell footage—nothing. No snow-white hands sticking notes, no silhouette sneaking around. It’s like the universe blinked and rewrote reality around him.\n\nI don’t know what this is, but I can’t sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face pressed against the glass. My phone battery’s dying, and I’m not sure if I should email work tomorrow or just take the day off to figure this out. I’ve never believed in the supernatural or conspiracy theories, but… something is very, very wrong here.\n\nI’ll update soon—provided I survive the night without one more note. If you don’t hear from me, well, maybe time really did catch up with me after all."},"5":{"title":"My high school bestie crossed the line","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh8bvn\/my_high_school_bestie_crossed_the_line\/","flair":null,"author":"pumpkindawg","selftext":"She always questioned why I was wearing make-up.\n\n \n\n“Is it for a boy?”\n\n \n\n“Why are you wearing it today and not yesterday?”\n\n \n\n“Why are you doing it different today?”\n\n \n\nBack in high school I could never catch a break from her. She was my best friend since middle school and there were literally zero boundaries between us in her mind. We had the same classes, sang in chorus together and went to the same church.\n\n \n\nBut even though her questions like these were irksome, it was best to not confront her head-on, which I think I always knew subconsciously, even before knowing what I do now.\n\n \n\nI have a taciturn and deeply non-confrontational personality, so back then I would rather die than to say the truth, which is to say I’d never admit to wanting to look attractive out loud.\n\n \n\nSo I’d pretend that I did my make-up absentmindedly just to end the conversation. We basically did the same song-and-dance every time I wore make-up. I found that it was just easier to lie. Or more often than not, just to not wear it, my looks and self-esteem be damned.\n\n \n\n——\n\n \n\nMore than anything these are the things that I remember about my early high school days. When I think back to all those drawn-out hours with her at school, carpool, chorus events, summer camps, I remember specific things like her questions about my make-up, any changes to my hair, new clothes, etc. And not to sound like a Queen Bee but it also seemed like if I bought anything new, she would too — jewelry, Keds, dresses, ringtones for my cell phone.\n\n \n\nWe had plenty of laughs and good times too, but the feelings that have persisted are the ones of insecurity and exhaustion from avoiding being on her bad side.\n\n \n\nI also remember her being a really tough hang. I couldn’t bring any new friends or acquaintances around. She was loud, talkative and needlessly abrasive to new people. If you looked up “RBF” in a dictionary, you’d see a picture of her being around someone she didn’t know already.\n\n \n\nShe was also an over-sharer, especially with gross body stuff, and an over-communicator. I couldn’t log onto AIM without her already being there, literally at all hours of the night. She called anytime she was driving from one place to another. And I learned that it was better to always answer, even if it was terrible timing.\n\n \n\nOne time, I passive aggressively didn’t answer when she called. After 5 minutes I gave her a call back — she didn’t answer. But she returned my call immediately. I didn’t answer her again and then called her right back.\n\n \n\nGuess what, she didn’t answer but again she called me right back.\n\n \n\nWe did this back and forth a couple more times — it felt obnoxious in the moment and even more so in hindsight. I came to the conclusion that she would never answer when I called, she’d only call me.\n\n \n\nOne time I literally couldn’t bring myself to answer; I was in one of those moods where I couldn’t stomach even a 5-minute conversation. So I text her and said I couldn’t talk and asked what was up. She never text me back and literally didn’t speak to me for an entire week. Apparently, she “was going through something and really needed me that day” but honestly I don’t believe that it was anything out of the ordinary.\n\n \n\nI don’t remember what eventually broke the silence between us after that tiff, but I remember feeling happy that we were on speaking terms again. After less than a day it was like it never happened.\n\n \n\n——\n\n \n\nNow, to the day that changed everything. It was a normal school day in late April; definitely in that post-Spring Break season where the sun is shining and it’s torture to be cooped up in a classroom.\n\n \n\nAnother one of her “quirks” is that she *had* to know what I scored on every test and likewise would tell me what she scored. It was a frustrating expectation of hers. She had a habit of calling herself “an intellectual” — without even a hint of irony, mind you — but in truth she was very, very smart so she usually scored higher than I did.\n\n \n\nBut one time in English I aced a test while she got something worse but respectable, like an 87. She asked what I got as soon as the teacher gave me my test back. I pretended not to hear her and put it facedown on my desk while I rummaged in my backpack.\n\n \n\nIn a flash she stood up, reached across and grabbed my test before I knew what was happening. It was all so aggressive and happened so rapidly that I couldn’t help but shoot her a nasty “what the hell” kind of look.\n\n \n\nI remember us having an uncomfortable beat or two of eye contact and then her looking at my test. After which her face darkened, severely. Whether it was my test result or my honest reaction to her invading my privacy and personal space, I had deeply offended her. What made matters worse is that everyone noticed since it was a sort of violent disruption to a quiet classroom.\n\n \n\nAfter that incident, again I got the silent treatment, but this stretched for more than two weeks. She was not speaking to me in the mornings at carpool, she skipped chorus events and at school it was just strange.\n\n \n\nI would look in her direction and she’d pretend to not notice me. But when I wasn’t looking I could feel her watching me. It was so weird, but I was not in a hurry to mend fences with her.\n\n \n\nOne day after school I got a text from her. This was so many years — and phones — ago so I don’t remember specifics, but it had something to do with a school assignment. There was no apology or warmth, or even an attempt to awkwardly address the situation.\n\n \n\nThe text was so random and I felt like she was fishing for a reaction, so I didn’t answer. I wanted to actually have a conversation, and if she couldn’t handle that then I was also fine just moving on. I wasn’t going to let her dictate how we were going to resolve things.\n\n \n\nLater that night, she sent another a message on AIM  that asked if I saw her text and also if she could come over right then. I logged off immediately so I wouldn’t feel compelled to answer, it was all really weird.\n\n \n\nShe wasn’t at school the next day. I didn’t think too much of it except that it was refreshing to not have to ignore her for a full school day.\n\n \n\nThat afternoon, one of our assistant principals showed up to my Biology classroom and asked for me to accompany him to the principal’s office. My principal began asking me questions about my friend and about her interest in computers, which I didn’t know how to answer. I said that she’s a whiz at AIM but that’s about all I knew.\n\n \n\nTurns out, my friend had made a hit list naming me directly. My principal had printed it out for me to read, and it was some of the most vulgar things I’ve ever read. He explained that she tried using an offshore router in her email to the school the day before, but they were able to easily pinpoint her IP address and alert the actual authorities.\n\n \n\nFrom there my recollection gets blurry, but I remember getting a police escort home from school that day with a helicopter overhead and everything. She was sent to juvenile detention and then eventually to a girls-only mental institution in Florida for a short stint.\n\n \n\nI don’t think she was ever formally convicted, but she was expelled. Her family moved that summer a few towns away and enrolled her at a private school.\n\n \n\nMy principal would check in with me randomly from that point until I graduated a few years later. I think he did that because he wanted to let me know that the administration was thinking about me, but I’m sure he was also angling to see if I received any threats, which I thankfully never did.\n\n \n\nSo many years have passed, and I honestly don’t think about those days too often. They were confusing and frustrating years, and the meeting with the principal and the fallout with my friend happened in quick succession.\n\n \n\nEvery now and again I’ll see her on social media and her name comes up here and there in conversations with family or old friends.\n\n \n\nI’m writing this all to give context:\n\n \n\nShe just messaged me on social media, and I’m not sure what to do."},"6":{"title":"My 5-year-old son started remembering a life that isn’t his.

I know how it’s going to sound. If I hadn’t lived through it, I’d scroll past this too. But if you’ve got kids—especially really young ones—maybe read this before you go to bed tonight. Or don’t. I wish I hadn’t waited.\n\nMy son, Jacob, is five. Smart kid. Sweet. A little obsessed with dinosaurs and drawing, like most boys his age. He’s never had any health issues. Never had night terrors. Until six weeks ago.\n\nIt started small. Stuff that’s easy to shrug off.\n\nHe woke me up one night around 2AM just standing in the hallway, staring into the dark. When I asked what he was doing, he said, “I was listening to the floor.” I laughed it off. Kids say weird things.\n\nBut then he started waking up with weird questions.\nLike, “Where did the basement go?” or “What happened to the boy who used to sleep here?”\n\nWe live in an apartment. There is no basement. And Jacob’s had this room since he was born.\n\nIt got worse.\n\nHe’d cry when I tried to tuck him in and say stuff like “I don’t want to go back in the hole.” Or “He’s watching from the wall crack.”\n\nI cut all screen time. No scary books. Asked his preschool if anything happened there. Nothing. He’s the happiest kid during the day. But every night, around 2:00–3:00 AM, I’d catch him awake. Talking to someone. Whispering. Always smiling.\n\nThen he stopped calling me “Mom.”\n\nHe started calling me Elaine.\n\nThat’s not my name.\n\nI asked him who Elaine was, and he said, “You. Before. When the house was still burning.” He said it like I should know what he meant.\n\nA week later, I found his drawings.\n\nPages of stick figures. All normal except for one: a tall, stretched-out shadow with black arms that touched the ground and a wide hole in its chest. It appeared over and over. Always standing beside a little boy. Jacob called it “The Keeper.”\n\nHe said “The Keeper lives under where the bricks were.” I asked what bricks. He said:\n\n“The bricks they buried me under.”\n\nThat night I barely slept. I did some digging the next day. Turns out our apartment complex was built in the early 90s. Before that? It was a group foster home.\n\nBurned down in 1989.\n\nSeven children died. All under ten. One body was never recovered.\n\nHis name was Eli Matthews.\n\nI found a newspaper article. There was a grainy photo.\n\nJacob looks exactly like him.\n\nSame chin, same freckles, same scar above the eyebrow.\n\nI showed it to my mother without explaining, and she asked me when Jacob took “that old-timey photo.”\n\nThe next night I caught him digging at the floor of his closet with a spoon.\n\nWhen I asked him what he was doing, he looked up and smiled. Not a five-year-old’s smile.\n\n“He’s almost done fixing the hole. Once it’s open, I have to go back.”\n\nI asked who.\n\nHe said, “The Keeper. He promised I’d get my real mom back.”\n\nLast night, I got a phone call at exactly 2:13AM.\n\nNo caller ID. Just static and breathing. Then a voice—low, cracked, like it came from inside a wall:\n\n“Elaine… he was never yours.”\n\nI ran to Jacob’s room.\n\nHe was standing in the corner, facing the wall. Smiling.\n\nHe turned to me and said:\n\n“He found the basement.”\n\nThere is no basement.\n\nThis morning, I checked his closet again.\n\nI noticed the carpet was slightly raised in the corner.\n\nUnderneath it was a wooden trapdoor I swear wasn’t there before.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nI opened it.\n\nThere’s a staircase.\n\nAnd it goes down.\n\nI’m posting this from my phone. I’m taking a flashlight. I’m going in. I don’t know what else to do.\n\nIf you don’t hear from me again—\n\nDon’t let him leave the house.\n\n"},"7":{"title":"They Knocked Like Police, But Their Eyes Were Glowing Red","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh44rn\/they_knocked_like_police_but_their_eyes_were\/","flair":null,"author":"avaldez518","selftext":"I’ve never told this story publicly. Not because I’m afraid people won’t believe me — I already know most won’t. But because the memory has faded over the years. Parts of it feel like fragments now, scattered and half-erased. And the pieces I do remember? They still scare the hell out of me.\n\nBut there’s one part I’ve never forgotten — not in the slightest. The two figures at the door with glowing red eyes.\n\nI was 15 or 16 when it happened. My dad worked late nights, so most evenings it was just me and my mom at home. That night felt normal. We were hanging out, playing video games in the living room. Curtains drawn. Lights dimmed. I remember the way the screen lit up the room — just us, the game, and the hum of quiet comfort.\n\nThen — knock, knock, knock.\n\nNot aggressive. Just a sharp, solid knock. I paused the game, got up, and went to the door.\n\nI looked through the peephole.\n\nNothing. No one.\n\nI stood there for a few seconds, waiting, then figured it was someone at the wrong house or maybe a neighbor’s door I heard through the walls. I sat back down.\n\nMy mom had stepped into the kitchen — I think to check on dinner or maybe clean something up. And then — knock, knock, knock.\n\nSame pattern. But louder this time. And then a voice, clear and firm:\n\n“It’s the police. Please open the door.”\n\nThat stopped me cold.\n\nI got up again, slower this time. Something felt off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I peeked through the peephole again.\n\nThat’s when I saw them.\n\nTwo figures standing on our porch. But they weren’t normal officers. In fact, they didn’t look human at all.\n\nTheir bodies were completely black — not clothing, not shadow, just blackness. Like voids. The porch light should have lit their faces, but it didn’t. There were no facial features. No eyes. No mouths. No badges. No shapes. Nothing.\n\nExcept for the glowing red eyes.\n\nTwo sets, staring straight ahead. Burning through the peephole like they knew I was there.\n\nI felt something twist in my stomach. Panic. I backed away from the door and went to my mom.\n\n“It’s the police,” I said. “But… something’s wrong.”\n\nShe came to the door, called out: “Hello? Who is it?”\n\nAnd again — knock, knock, knock.\n\n“It’s the police.”\n\nSame voice. Same flat, unnatural tone. Like a recording. No emotion. No variation.\n\nShe looked through the peephole.\n\nHer face drained instantly. Her expression shifted in a way I’d never seen before. She turned to me and whispered, “Get down. Now.”\n\nI dropped to the floor.\n\n“What do you want?” she called again, louder this time. Her voice was steady, but I could hear the tension under it.\n\nKnock. Knock. Knock.\n\n“The police. Please open the door.”\n\nShe pressed her body against the door and, as quietly as she could, turned the deadbolt and locked the bottom latch. Then she backed away, grabbed her phone, and started dialing.\n\nMe? I couldn’t help myself. I peeked again.\n\nThey were closer.\n\nTheir glowing red eyes seemed even brighter now, like they were feeding off something. The porch light was gone — not broken, just gone. Replaced by blackness. It felt like they were right there, just a breath away.\n\nI screamed.\n\nMy mom came rushing back, knife in hand, panic in her eyes. “Hide behind the couch,” she said. She was already on the phone with my dad, trying to explain. He didn’t believe her — thought she was overreacting, maybe dreaming. But he said he was on his way.\n\nThen she dialed the actual police.\n\nAnd that’s when the knocking got violent.\n\nBANG. BANG. BANG.\n\n“It’s the police. Please open up.”\n\nShe shouted, “Leave! I have a gun!”\n\nShe didn’t. Just the knife. And me? I grabbed one too, thinking I was being brave. She noticed and shoved it away, telling me to stay down.\n\nIt all gets hazy after that. I remember her looking again. Me trying not to cry. Then… nothing.\n\nThey were gone.\n\nJust like that. No more knocking. No red eyes. No voices. Just silence.\n\nMinutes later, my dad got home. He checked outside. No one. No footprints. No car. Just darkness.\n\nThe real police arrived a while later. We told them what happened. They said no officers were dispatched to our address. Nothing on record. No calls. No activity near our street at all.\n\nTo this day, we don’t know who — or what — those figures were.\n\nAll I know is this: I’ll never forget those eyes. And neither will my mom.\n\nWe don’t talk about it anymore. Not because we don’t believe it happened — but because we do."},"8":{"title":"I record dreams for living","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kherme\/i_record_dreams_for_living\/","flair":null,"author":"Willing_Procedure_34","selftext":"\n\nThree months ago, I got a job offer from a company I’d never heard of.\nNo interview. No background check. Just an email.\n“Dream research assistant needed. Quiet night work. High pay. Must be discreet.”\n\n\n\nI thought it was a scam, but I clicked anyway. I was two months behind on rent and tired of grinding delivery apps and night shifts at a gas station. Two days later, I was standing in a windowless room at the back of a warehouse on the edge of town, reading a non-disclosure agreement that might as well have been written in blood.\n\n“You will not share any details about the work, equipment, or subjects. Any breach will be met with legal and… appropriate consequences.”\n\nI signed it. I shouldn’t have.\n\nThe room I worked in had two chairs, two monitors, and one machine — a dome-shaped thing about the size of a watermelon, covered in metallic wires and nodes. The label read: MIMIR NEURAL SYNC UNIT.\nThey said it could \"interface with REM wave activity\" to let us observe and catalog dream visuals in real time.\nI didn't ask how it worked. I just did what they told me.\n\nEvery night from 11 PM to 5 AM, I came in, put on the headset, and watched people’s dreams play out like grainy, half-finished films.\nMy job was to log what I saw:\nTags. Colors. Symbols. Emotions. Distortions.\nMost of them were forgettable — bizarre, disconnected messes. Like the mind dumping its trash into the subconscious.\n\nI watched a woman relive her wedding as a loop where her groom’s face kept changing into her dead dog.\nA man had a recurring dream about drowning in cereal.\nOne guy just sat in a red chair in an endless desert for six hours.\nI didn’t care. I just tagged and logged. The pay was good. The work was quiet.\n\nUntil shift #27.\n\nThat night, the dream opened with a man walking through a long white hallway. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. He wore a dark hoodie. I couldn’t see his face. His steps echoed. The hallway had doors — each with numbers.\n\nRoom 11.\nRoom 12.\nRoom 13…\n\nHe stopped at Room 16.\nHe opened the door and stepped inside.\nAnd I felt cold.\n\nI wasn’t just watching anymore. It felt like… I was in it. Like my thoughts had shifted into his.\nThe room inside was familiar. Too familiar.\nCracked white walls. A humming mini-fridge. A ceiling fan with a broken blade. A desk with an old laptop and a blue chair.\nMy room. Down to the scratch on the window frame and the photo of me and my sister at the carnival.\nThis was my apartment. The one I lived in right now.\nOn the desk was my journal — the one I kept locked.\nIn the dream, the man opened it.\nOne line was written over and over in shaky block letters:\n\n“They are watching you too.”\n\nI ripped off the headset. Hit the emergency alert button. First time I ever used it.\nNo one came.\n\nThe next day, I demanded answers. I found Dr. Kalder, the lead researcher.\n\n“What the hell was that last dream?” I asked. “That was my apartment. That journal— I’ve never shown anyone that.”\n\nShe didn’t blink.\n“ID# 616-T,” I said. “Who is that?”\n\nShe stared at me for a long time. Then said, calmly: “You were told not to ask questions.”\n\n“But that’s me, isn’t it? I’m the subject. You’ve been watching me.”\n\nA pause. A smile.\n\n“No,” she said. “You’re just the receiver.”\n\nThen she walked away.\n\nAfter that, things got worse.\n\nThe dreams weren’t random anymore. They all started in that hallway. The same man. The same doors.\nRoom 17. Room 18. Room 19...\n\nEvery night, he’d open the next door. And each time, it was another place from my past.\nThe classroom where I wet my pants in first grade.\nThe church basement where I found my uncle passed out drunk.\nMy sister’s old bedroom, the night after the accident.\n\nSometimes he just stood there and stared. Other times, he’d whisper things.\nOnce, he looked directly into the dream feed and said:\n“Why did you lie?”\n\nI stopped sleeping. I’d go home, lie in bed, and feel like I was still being watched.\nThe black van across the street. The flicker of the hallway camera even though no one passed.\n\nI started having dreams outside of the lab — dreams that felt like the ones I saw at work. Same angle. Same man.\nExcept now, I wasn’t sure who was dreaming whom.\n\nThen came shift #42.\n\nThe hallway ended. No more doors.\nThe man stood at the last one: Room 23.\nInside, it was pitch black.\nFor a long time, he just stood there.\nThen he stepped in.\nAnd the feed went dead.\nA message appeared on the screen:\n“MIMIR SYNC TERMINATED: ACCESSING DEEPCORE FILES.”\n\nAnother screen popped up. A split feed. On the left: a live camera view — the break room, where I sat on lunch 20 minutes ago. On the right: an old video, grainy black-and-white footage.\n\nI watched myself… sleeping.\n\nYears younger. Electrodes on my head. Someone whispering to me off camera:\n“You’re going to forget this. It’s better if you forget.”\nI threw off the headset. Ran down the hallway.\nThe door I thought led outside… was gone.\nIn its place: a white hallway.\nWith numbered doors.\n\nRoom 1.\nRoom 2.\nRoom 3…\n\nI don’t know how long I’ve been here now.\nSome nights I think I’ve escaped. I wake up in my bed. The world looks normal.\nUntil I spot the man in the hoodie across the street.\nUntil I turn on my phone and see a recording of my dream from the night before.\nI think the job was never real. I think I never left the lab.\nOr maybe I never applied in the first place.\n\nI just wanted a paycheck.\nWhat I got was a front-row seat to my own breakdown.\nAnd if anyone’s reading this — if this shows up on your feed — ask yourself:\nWhen was the last time you really woke up?\n\nBecause I’m starting to think some of us are still dreaming.\n"},"9":{"title":"The kid ate his dad’s face.

A bad habit this town has with its murder-suicides.\n\nIt’s not enough for somebody to shove a knife through a ribcage and suck back on a 12 gauge anymore. No, now everybody has to be original. \n\n*Unique.* \n\nThey’ve gotta peel off their victim’s face, then scarf it down like skin jerky before slashing their throats. \n\nDo you know how long it takes to bleed out after cutting your carotid artery?\n\nNot long. \n\nThirty seconds, maybe. \n\nA minute if you’re *really* unlucky. \n\nThat’s not a lot of time to stage an arrest. To interrogate a murderer. To figure out why they killed their lover, their parents, their best friend. It’s not much time to parse through the mental quagmire that compels an individual to carve off a face and swallow it whole. \n\nIt just isn’t. \n\nSo I’ve had to make do. \n\nI’ve spent the last month digging through old case files and buried corpses. I’ve studied the local folklore and researched nearby legends. I’ve run a social media scan for sightings of anything supernatural, eerie, or otherwise batshit insane within a thirty mile radius — all to figure out what might be causing these cannibal suicides. \n\nAnd you know what I managed to find?\n\nNothing. \n\nNadda. \n\nZilch. \n\n. . .\n\nUntil tonight. \n\nSee, I’ve had a breakthrough — and it even has a name: \n\n*Jonah*. \n\nSeventeen years old. Bright. Studious. \n\nCaptain of the football team. Head of the debate club. Chair of the student council for human rights and class valedictorian. Not just a good kid, but the kind that universities fight over.\n\nFour days ago, he murdered his father.\n\nTore off the man’s face and chased it down with a glass of ginger ale, then cut his own throat and dropped dead beside him.\n\nOr at least, that was the plan. \n\nUnfortunately, as fantastic as Jonah was at everything else in life, he wasn’t much when it came to suicide. \n\nLacked follow-through, you might say. \n\nThe kid didn’t sever his jugular so much as dramatically nick it. Deep enough to pass out from blood loss, but shallow enough that the paramedics were able to salvage his life.  \n\nAnd that was a mistake. \n\nBecause now he’s all mine. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI’ve never cared much for hospitals.\n\nIt’s a combination of the sterile fluorescents and the way the air smells like chemical warfare, the way everywhere you look it’s either more clutter or abject emptiness. \n\nMaybe that’s why Jonah looks so unnerved when he sees me. \n\nIt’s my expression. \n\nBitter. Repulsed. \n\nBut it's hard not to feel this way. Hospitals make me think of my sister, and my sister makes me think of—\n\n“Who are you?” Jonah croaks.\n\nHis voice sounds like he spent the evening gargling razor blades. He's lying in the bed like a mummy, bandages strangling his throat. \n\nI close the door behind me. Lock it. \n\nHe asks the question again. It sounds even more painful the second time around.\n\nI still don’t answer.\n\nWe haven’t reached that stage in our relationship yet. \n\nInstead, I cross the room, unbutton my jacket, and drape it over the chair by his bed. Then I take a seat. All the while, he's staring at me like I’m a hallucination, like nothing about me makes sense. \n\nUnderstandable.\n\nFrom Jonah's perspective, it's ten in the evening. A stranger just walked into his hospital room wearing a black suit and a scowl, carrying the kind of briefcase that screams bad news. \n\nHe probably thinks I’m here to audit his health insurance. \n\nThat, or snatch his kidneys. \n\nBut I’ve got worse things on my mind. \n\nI open my briefcase, shuffle through a handful of documents before finding my clipboard. The form attached is a standard 34-3A Interrogation Report. Useful when determining an individual’s involvement in supernatural violence. \n\nMy pen clicks. Scribbles Jonah’s name up top. \n\nHe tries to speak again. Only manages to wheeze.\n\nMy pen keeps scratching. I note the size of his pupils, his tangled brown hair, the way the corner of his mouth twitches in tune with his mounting dread. Then I fill in a dozen other fields: boiler-plate bullshit that’s too dull to describe.\n\nAge. \n\nLocation. \n\n“Are you with—”  \n\nJonah winces. It probably feels like throwing up asphalt every time he speaks. \n\nHe pushes through anyway. \n\n“Are you…with the police?”\n\nI pause, look up from my report and meet his eyes. Just to let him know I see him. To let him know I hear him. \n\nThen I go back to the clipboard. \n\nHere’s the secret nobody tells you about conversations: it’s not about what you say, but what you don’t. The only thing more agonizing than being spoken to is being ignored. \n\nAnd right on schedule, Jonah starts to break. \n\nHe lurches up in his bed, stiff and sore. Confused. Hits the call button for his nurse. Once. Twice. Then he starts hammering it; only nobody is coming because I’m good at my job. \n\nLike I said, Jonah’s all mine. \n\nHe tries to shout, but it’s so weak, so hoarse. Barely a rasp. “Nurse! Hello?”\n\nThe boy genius finally realized I’m not supposed to be here.\n\nGood for him. \n\nI scratch out the last of his tombstone data, then clear my throat. \n\nHis gaze swivels to me. “The nurse—”\n\n“Isn't coming,” I tell him, clicking my pen and sliding it into my shirt. “She went home early, so did security. It’s just you and me tonight.”\n\nJonah’s eyes are buzzing, his mind blue-screening as he tries to calculate just who I am and what I’m doing here. “I already told the detectives everything I know,\" he says.\n\n“I’m aware. I’m here to ask you some questions of my own.”\n\n“Why? Who are you exactly?”\n\nI loosen the tie around my collar. “Suffice it to say that I work for an organization that’s taken an interest in your... situation. It’s a private enterprise. Off the books. We call ourselves the Order of Alice.”\n\nHe gives me a blank stare. \"I've never heard of it.\"\n\n\"That's the idea.\"\n\n“So then you’re *not* a cop?” \n\nThe way he says the words is like he wants to believe them but can’t. \n\nI lean forward, cutting my voice to a whisper. “No, kid. I'm an Inquisitor. The guy you call when the monster under your bed needs to be *euthanized*.”\n\nJonah’s heart monitor slows. \n\nI just told the kid that monsters are real; that our whole reality is a carefully constructed sham, and instead of panicking, he’s breathing a sigh of relief. \n\nI’d call that unusual. \n\nA cough rattles from my throat. Wet. Nasty. The kind that sounds like I'm not just spitting up phlegm, but years of my life.  \n\nI could only be so lucky.\n\n“What are you looking for?” Jonah asks, watching me fish in my jacket. \n\nI pull out a pack of cigarettes. Slip one between my lips. “Medicine.”\n\nFor a second, the kid looks like he might tell me you can't smoke in here, like he might try his hand at a lecture. Then he spots the gun at my hip and thinks better of it.\n\nLike I said, a smart cookie.\n\n“You told the cops that you didn’t murder your father,” I mumble, lighting the cigarette. “You said it was someone else—some*thing* else. Correct?\"\n\nHe nods, or as close as he can manage with all the gauze around his neck. “Is that why you’re here… You actually believe me?” \n\nHis voice is two parts hopeful, one part desperate. It probably doesn't feel great to have your whole community think you murdered your father and ate his face.\n\n“Sure,” I tell him. “I believe you.”\n\nHe falls back on his pillows, relieved. “Thank god. Nobody else does. The way the detectives were talking sounded like they were angling for first-degree murder. Life in prison sorta thing.”\n\n“Relax. You’re not going to prison.”\n\n“You think they’ll acquit me?”\n\nI laugh. \n\nNot on purpose—scout’s honor. It’s just that I can’t help myself.\n\n“Hell no. If this state had the death penalty, you’d skip the line three times over.” \n\nAnother drag. \n\nAnother stormcloud. \n\n“Then why did you just tell me that—”\n\n“You won’t end up in prison because by the end of tonight, you won't exist.”\n\nThe implication hangs in the air like a guillotine. \n\nThe kid shrinks. His arms wrap around himself, protective, horrified. He probably thinks I'm talking about the monster coming for reprisals. He'd be half right.\n\n“You're innocent,” I tell him. “Same as all the other murder-suicides. Like you, they were victims: just an audience to their nightmares, no different than my sister.”\n\nHe blinks.\n\nChrist.\n\nThere goes my motormouth.\n\n“What happened to your sister?” he asks. \n\n“Same thing that happened to you, only she didn’t botch the suicide.”\n\nI heave a sigh, ashing my cigarette onto the floor. “That’s why I’m so interested in your case, I guess. I’d like to know the name of the monster that did this to you—that did this to *her*.”\n\nHis eyes unfocus with the sort of detached dread that makes the thousand-yard stare look nearsighted. “I'm sorry,” he whispers. “I can’t… I can't tell you its name.”\n\n“Sure you can.”\n\nHe shakes his head. “No, you don’t understand. All of this started the second I learned that thing’s name. If I speak it. If you hear it, then—”\n\n“It’ll come for me next.”\n\nI lean forward to look him in the eyes. \n\n“I'm counting on it.”\n\nHe recoils, a quiet horror about him. “You make it sound like you *want* to die.”\n\n\"Maybe I do.\"\n\nI crush the smoke on the armrest. Hack another cough. This one's got a bit of blood with the phlegm.\n\nLovely.\n\n\"Or maybe I don’t get a say in the matter.\"\n\n“Is it…?”\n\n\"Leukemia,” I tell him. “Stage 4. Doc figures I’ve got another year in me, assuming I kick the habit. A few months if I don’t. You can do the math on that yourself.”\n\nHis gaze turns downward. “My mother died of leukemia. It's an awful disease.”\n\nIt is, but when it nets me this kind of emotional buy-in, it's at least useful. \n\nI glance at the clock on the wall. It's 10:35 PM.\n\nThat means it's time to pick up the pace. \n\n“Listen, I’m not looking for sympathy, kid. I’m telling you I know the stakes. I’m dead whether I like it or not, so there’s nothing you’re protecting me from.”\n\nJonah shifts in his blankets, like there's something eating him inside. “It's not just about protecting you,” he sputters. “This thing doesn’t just make you kill yourself. It makes you kill—”\n\n“I already know that. What I need from you is its *name*.”\n\nHe sucks back a breath, grimacing. He's having a crisis of conscience, battling his morals. He doesn’t think I know what I’m getting into, that he can save me some suffering if only he keeps his big mouth shut. \n\nBut I don’t have time for heroics. \n\n“Jonah. You have the chance to save *lives* here. To prove your *innocence*. Right now, your father died for nothing. Tell me that name, and I can make his death count for something.”\n\nAnd there it is, the final twist of the knife.\n\nLike most young men, Jonah can’t help but want to do good by his father, to chase that validation even while daddy's buried six feet in the dirt.  \n\nHis eyes find mine. Haunted. Hollow. \"Okay,” he says. \n\nThen his lips start to move, and each syllable sounds sweeter than the last.\n\nHe gives me what I’ve been searching for. The monster that destroyed my family, that stole my sister. \n\nHe gives me the key to unlock the gates of hell, and it’s called:\n\n**“Zipperjaw.”**\n\nI scratch it down on my clipboard in haphazard scrawl, and sure enough, the name vanishes as soon as the ink forms. That’s a bullseye. A bingo. \n\nI smile like a maniac.\n\nCan’t help it. \n\nThirty years. That’s how long I’ve been searching for my sister’s reaper. It’s what led me to join up with the Order of Alice in the first place, but after so many dead ends, I’d all but given up hope.\n\nBut now that I've got one foot in the grave, It's finally shown itself. \n\nHere of all places.\n\nIt’s almost like it lured me, pulled me back for one last dance before I closed my book for good. \n\nMy hand, my whole arm, is shaking. Tremoring.\n\nI’m *afraid.*\n\nHow long has it been since the last time I was truly, honestly *afraid*?\n\n“Oh god,” Jonah mutters, burying his face in his hands. “I shouldn’t have done that.\"\n\nI glance up, my smile fracturing. \n\n\"You seem like a good person,” he says, his voice breaking. “I really shouldn't have done that.”\n\nThe kid’s really gonna turn on the waterworks and ruin the moment here?\n\n“It’s fine,” I tell him. “I already told you, I’m a dead man walking regardless.”\n\nBut Jonah lowers his hands, takes an ugly breath. “You don’t get it,” he says weakly. “Once you know its name, Zipperjaw doesn’t just *kill* you. It finds the person you care most about and forces you to slaughter them. Just like… Just like…”\n\n“It made you kill your father.”\n\nHe looks up at me. Nods. The look in his eyes is so honest-to-god guilty. \n\nHe feels awful. \n\nTerrible. \n\nHe’s probably imagining my kids dying, or my parents, or grandparents, or a childhood friend. He’s probably imagining Zipperjaw forcing me to kill some innocent bystander, just like it forced him to kill his old man, and it’s tearing him up inside. \n\n“I’m a monster,” he whimpers, gripping a fistful of his hair.  \n\n“No, you’re a good kid. If there's a monster here, Jonah, it's me.”\n\nHe blinks through a sheet of tears. He doesn’t understand. Not yet.\n\nBut he will. \n\n“I'm… a difficult person,” I tell him. “Anger. Bitter. Most women are smart enough to avoid me, which means I haven’t got any kids. No spouse. My parents were abusive enough that if my sister hadn’t beaten me to the punch, I’d have probably killed them myself.”\n\nJonah's eyes soften, guilt fading into sympathy and horror. \n\n“I know, I know. I’m trauma dumping. I’ve never really figured out the trick to following social norms—to understanding conversational boundaries.” \n\nI gnaw my lip, fingers dancing on the armrest. \n\n“My therapist calls it sociopathy. Or maybe it was psychopathy? It’s hard to remember. Haven’t got the DSM handy to compare.”\n\nJonah’s eyes start to narrow. Piece by piece, the puzzle is forming in his mind.\n\n“The point I’m trying to make is that I don’t have attachments to things. Not in the way you do. The closest I come to feeling a sense of connection is probably through my work.” \n\nI chuckle, shaking my head. “You might say I’m married to my job.”\n\nJonah swallows. “What are you trying to say?\"\n\n“Zipperjaw killed my sister,” I tell him, an absent smile carving a path across my face. “The only person I ever truly cared about. And now? There’s nothing I cherish more than the thought of ripping it to pieces—and the only way I get to do that is through you, Jonah.”\n\n“That means I need your story. It means I need to know what happened the night you ate your father’s face. I need all of it—every last detail.”\n\nThe heart monitor starts to scream. \n\nJonah tries to lurch from his bed, but I shoot from my seat. Shove him back down. \n\n“Let me go!” he rasps. “Get off!”\n\nLike I said, a smart cookie. \n\nHe’s finally pieced it together, recognizing the nightmare unfolding before him. Only I can’t risk any miscommunication. Not while midnight is just an hour away — and Zipperjaw with it. \n\nI press my finger against his jugular. Not hard. Just hard enough that he stops fighting and starts cooperating. \n\n“You get it now, don't you?”\n\nHe's shaking like cornered livestock. His eyes dart to the clock on the wall: 11:12 PM. \n\n“It's you,” I say quietly, inches from his ear. “Right now, nobody in the entire world is more important to me than you are, Jonah.”\n\nHe tenses. It’s all crashing down on him now — the horror of what he’s done — of what I’ve done *to* him. \n\nIt wasn’t personal. \n\nIt’s just that I need him motivated. Focused. I need a surefire way to push him past his trauma and get to the core of his experience. That means he has to have some skin in the game. \n\n“You asshole,” he spits, voice dripping with betrayal. “You *used* me.”\n\nI reach for my clipboard, slip my pen from my pocket.\n\n“Didn't have much choice—people are dying in this town. They're killing their loved ones. Carving off faces. Just the same way my sister did. And I have to know why, Jonah. I have to know why Zipperjaw does these awful things.”\n\nHe recoils, disgusted. “You actually think your sister would be okay with this? Sacrificing some traumatized *teenager* just to satisfy your stupid revenge fantasy?” \n\nMy eye twitches. \n\nAdelaide.\n\nShe wouldn't think this was stupid. She'd be proud of her big brother…\n\n*Wouldn't she?*\n\nI shake my head, forcing her memory back into its grave. “My sister's dead,” I grunt. “This isn't about what she would want. It's about what I *need*. It's about making Zipperjaw pay for what it took.”\n\n\"You're deranged,” he mutters. “An absolute lunatic.”\n\n\"Maybe. But you know as well as I do what happens at midnight.” My pen clicks. Stabs the clipboard like a knife. “So I'd start talking—or pretty soon you won't have a face to talk with.\"\n\n[MORE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCryptid\/comments\/jba8ww\/story_master_list\/)"},"10":{"title":"I'm never going to the Forest again.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh9yzs\/im_never_going_to_the_forest_again\/","flair":null,"author":"YesAwake311","selftext":"I’d like to start out by saying that this happened a long time ago and the emotions that led me to take the actions I did are long gone. I wouldn’t describe myself as happy, but I’m much better off than I was back then. I know that there is hope, what I was contemplating was a permanent solution, blah blah blah. That’s not what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. I feel that because it’s been so long, I can confidently separate what I was going through from what I saw in the forest that day. I also feel that I have finally arrived at the conclusion that what I saw that night was real.\n\nTo understand what I was doing in the woods, I think you need to understand why I was there. If it wasn’t obvious, I was there to kill myself. I didn’t have a lot going for me back then and losing my job was the final straw. I decided to do it in the state park about 30 minutes from my parents’ house where I lived. I picked that place because I had some interesting memories there growing up. Even as a teenager, I was a loner and that park was a place of solitude for me. I was there nearly every weekend. I say nearly since they shut it down for a month because bodies were found with some unusual markings. After they realized they couldn’t figure out what caused those people to lose their eyes and drop dead, they opened it up again. Some people felt it was a hoax, and honestly it probably was. They never released any more information about the supposed victims so it was really just a big ball of nothing in my opinion. Even the stories and everything surrounding them didn’t stop me from going every weekend. Looking back, I understand it wasn’t great for me and so much solitude in the woods probably didn’t help my mental health. But I couldn’t stop. I loved how the forest felt when I was there. Even on days when I wasn’t planning on going, I’d literally dream about it. I missed the way the trees moved and how it felt to smell that fresh outdoor air. I think that was another reason I felt it was the place to do it. It felt like it was meant to be, you know?\n\nAnyway, in the days leading up to it, I hadn’t gone up there in a while. I was already on thin ice at work and I couldn’t keep missing more days. But when I found out that I was being downsized, the park called me again. It felt like I was going home when I finally got there. No one was going to ask me what my plans were. No one would ask why I’m still working at a restaurant so many years after all of us graduated. No judgemental tones. Just peace. I decided to stop at the closest gas station and bring some wood for a campfire. It was a Tuesday afternoon that I went, so I knew the campsites would be empty. The park itself was mildly popular at its height but ever since the shutdown after the bodies, it never really regained the visitors that were once there. I found the campsite I wanted and sat down. I started a fire and used the remaining light of the day to write out my final notes to my family and friends. Once it got dark, all I had was the light of the fire. It was a crisp autumn day so the fire warmed me up nicely. Once the light started dying down, I figured it was my turn too. I realized that this was my last night on Earth so I decided to take it all in. I wanted to just close my eyes and feel what the forest was telling me. I was expecting to hear the usual crickets, the comforting wind, and maybe even the distant car driving on the freeway. I wanted to smell the burning wood and the familiar scent of the Douglas Fir that surrounded me. You might think that these are details that don’t matter. What was important was that what I expected wasn’t there.\n\nWhat I heard was absolutely nothing.\n\nWhat I smelt was absolutely nothing.\n\nIt’s like I was sitting in my living room and had my headphones on or something. Any other day, I would have been unnerved. But I took this as a sign. Everything was gone and it was my turn to join it. At this point, I knew it was time. I won’t go into what method I used or what my exact plans were. While I’ve been somewhat flippant about this, I’m able to do that after years of therapy and medication. Just know that I was prepping what I needed to finally leave it all behind. The forest was completely dark at this point as well, other than the small fire that was close to puttering out. As I was ironing out the final touches, I heard what ultimately turned this into an experience worth sharing. It was a simple word and in any other context, I wouldn’t have really given it a second thought. But with the silence that had fallen on the woods, the sound cut through so I could hear it as clear as glass.\n\n“Hello.”\n\nIt sounds silly and I’m sure you’re thinking that I imagined it. I know I would if someone told me. But without getting into detail about what I was doing to end it, I’ll just say that I hadn’t even started yet. My mind was clear other than the fact that I had absolute determination on what I was planning to do. But as you might expect, this gave me pause. Thinking back on it, what was most unnerving was how it sounded. It was clearly a male voice but what was off about it was how it sounded. It wasn’t exactly someone saying it to greet me but it was as though it was a statement. Like someone asked it “what is the word that people say to greet each other” and it responded with that. What was more bizarre was that it sounded somewhat robotic. Almost like when you tell Google translate to speak what you’ve typed out. It gave me pause but not enough to stop me from doing what I came here to do. I assumed I imagined it like anyone else would and got on with it. At this point, I’ll have to describe where I’m at because the location of everything becomes important. I’m not the best at describing this sort of thing so bear with me. The fire pit was at the end of a path that went about 50 feet off of the main trail. The landing I was at was also below some steps that were surrounded by a thick level of brush. The fire pit itself was in the middle along with a single bench and room for a small tent. This whole landing was actually on a cliff that overlooked pine trees that were probably 50 to 70 feet high. I loved this area because the spot was not only somewhat hidden but also extremely easy to get to if you knew what you were doing.\n\nAnyway, when I saw the lights coming on the tree line across the cliff, I figured I was losing it. There was absolutely no way someone could climb up there. And I know for a fact it wasn’t just light that was being shined up from the bottom because I would have seen the beam. The lights were green horizontal lines that were touching the tips of the pine trees and were appearing and disappearing. Imagine lines that would appear and disappear on your computer screen but they’re on the trees. I can’t think of any other way to explain it. It was also extremely strange that they weren’t really mapping to the tree tips if that makes sense. You know how if you shine a laser pointer across a few things in your house and you can tell its being projected onto the item because it goes over and under? Well what was strange about these lines was that they were just covering the trees with the completely solid green color. I definitely thought it was my own vision going but no matter what I did like rubbing my eyes, using my water bottle to splash my face, they wouldn’t stop. The lights continued and started to act more erratically. I couldn’t stop staring at them. At the moment, I figured I was just entranced by the unique sight but looking back, I realized I was likely frozen and couldn’t move if I wanted to. While it was happening, I remembered why I was there and what I wanted to do. The deep sense of apathy came over me once more and I suddenly didn’t care about some stupid lights. I’m leaving. Why should I? Once those emotions came back, the lights stopped. Everything else that I was thinking left my head and what remained was one thought:\n\nMove deeper into the forest.\n\nI didn’t realize it at the time but that single thought probably saved my life. Honestly, at the time, I just figured there would be more seclusion. I wasn’t convinced that what I saw wasn’t just a person messing with me or trying to stop what I was doing since it was pretty obvious, though I’m not sure how they could see me. I gathered what I needed, put out the fire and started up the path to the main trail using my phone as a flashlight. I was somewhat aware of the fact that I’d never been here after dark before but given that I was here to die, the black unknown that my light couldn’t see wasn’t as scary to me as it should have been. However, the once welcoming brush that surrounded the rocky steps felt different now. It wasn’t necessarily scary per se, but it did feel wrong. I knew this place backwards after all of my years of coming here, but for some reason, I felt like I was lost. The brush swayed back and forth in what I would assume was the wind, but I could barely hear it. It wasn’t as quiet as it was before, because it felt like the sounds of the forest that I should be hearing were coming in and out, like someone was messing with a volume dial on a speaker. I kept moving and finally reached the main trail. I was vaguely aware of where I needed to go but honestly, with how lost I felt, I was kind of just walking in a random direction. I started looking down at the trail so I was at least ensuring to follow it to the next campsite. The forest noises were really throwing me for a loop and it really was unnerving me that the trees and brush were swaying even though there was no wind. My head was pointed down now and I was still frantically following the path which was illuminated by the light on my phone. \n\nAt this point, I forgot why I was even in the forest. All that was there was just me and my phone light and the blackness between the trees. The combination of the noise modulation and the trees moving felt like I was being digested and being pushed further toward the middle of the woods.\n\nSuddenly, the sounds stopped, even though the forest was still moving. It was quiet again, just like before. The change in noise got me to look up from the path, at which point I heard the voice again, but right in my ear.\n\n“How are you”\n\nI let out a cry and started running away. I wasn’t sure where but I must have gone off the path since I ended up in a clearing, surrounded by a bunch of trees. I regained my composure and shined my flashlight around me to see where I was and where I should go. I saw trees to my north and south and to my east. They were still moving, just much more rapidly than before. I shined it to my west and saw a figure standing there with its back turned toward me.\n\nIt was probably 10 feet away. The trees around it were still swaying but it stood absolutely still. It was clearly a person. It had arms, legs, and something resembling a head. It was then that I registered that it was wearing the same clothes that I was. I think I noticed this because I knew what clothes I wanted to die in and was very intentional about wearing them today. To see them on whatever was in front of me would have been impossible for me to miss. Whatever its head should have been was shaking and twitching as I heard what I could only describe as wheezing. It would have this long, high noise and it would let out a sigh. It was almost rhythmic.\n\nIt was then that I noticed that I couldn’t move.\n\nI knew that in that moment, if it turned around, I would probably die. Not because it would kill me but because I, under no circumstance, should see what is on the other side of that head. It was the most important thing in the world to me at that point. With effort, I closed my eyes, which could still thankfully move and the tears started flowing on their own, along with the sweat that also came. However, even though I was scared out of my wits, I realized I was also ready to go. I remembered why I was here. My loved ones would still find my notes that I had with me and that would be it. The tears stopped and I finally felt at peace. I was ready for whatever this thing would do to me and frankly, I didn’t really care. The moment this realization hit, my knees buckled and I realized I could move. I opened my eyes and it was gone. The sounds of the forest had returned and I realized that I was on the main path again. The trees weren’t moving anymore, or at least not like they were before. I heard the crickets, the small animals running around at night, and even some mosquitoes buzzing here and there. I knew the ordeal was over because I knew where I was again in the forest. It was the familiar place that I grew up with once more. However, given everything that happened, I was done with what the forest had in store for me. Without thinking too much, I ran on the main path and out of the woods.\n\nI haven’t been back since then, even though I still dream about it. Not regularly, but enough to make me want to at least share this with someone. I’ll be honest, I think it's calling me but I know better than to answer. I’m not sure what it was that I saw, but I know that I will never go back there again. Since that experience, I’ve really stepped up and taken care of my mental health a bit more. I would say that it was my mind trying to save me from what I was planning on doing but I’ve had day dreams and hallucinations before and they were never that vivid. Believe me if you want or don’t. I know what I saw and strangely enough, it helped me. I live in a city now, in another state, far away from any trees. The park’s hold on me is much less than before and even though the dreams haven’t stopped, I have too much to live for these days. I hope to never find out what that was or why it happened. But it saved me from myself and for that, I’m honestly grateful."},"11":{"title":"My Reflection Isn't Mine Anymore. It's Practicing. (Part 2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khamtd\/my_reflection_isnt_mine_anymore_its_practicing\/","flair":"Series","author":"GrandLeopard3","selftext":"Living on the couch now. Permanent resident. Day… eleven? Twelve? Time’s gone slurry, viscous, unreliable. Measured in lukewarm instant coffee and my heart trying to beat its way out. Haven't set foot inside the bedroom since the hall mirror… performed its silent, breathless autopsy. Door stays shut, chair wedged tightly under the knob. Pathetic, useless defense. Doesn’t matter anyway. The feeling of being watched is a constant, clammy, suffocating pressure, leaking like toxic gas from every potentially reflective surface. Laptop screen when dark, phone glass between obsessive scrolls, window panes slick with grime, the greasy curve of a spoon in the sink. Caught a sickening ripple, like heat haze but emanating palpable cold, distort the reflection on the chrome kettle yesterday when I walked past quickly, eyes averted. It can use anything. Anywhere it can see me. Any surface holding even a ghost of my image.\n\n\n\nThe exhaustion is a physical illness now, a deep, grinding ache in my bones, a persistent, nauseating buzz behind my eyes. Hands shake so badly I spilled coffee again this morning – ugly brown Rorschach patterns on the worn floorboards. Thoughts feel… slippery, fragmented, like trying to hold wet soap. Keep zoning out, staring blankly at the wall, coming back with a jolt, unsure what I meant to do. Short-term memory feels full of holes. Did I really leave the milk out again? Found it warm, slightly sour. Did I imagine hearing that sharp floorboard creak right behind me washing dishes, spinning around to find nothing? The doubt is a separate, insidious horror, a fifth column whispering maybe it's just you breaking down. Maybe Maya was right.\n\n\n\nBut then the cold numbness flares up unpredictably on my left arm – the exact spot where I felt that impossible icy pressure slide across my skin. Not constant, maybe a few times a day, a phantom chill distinct from the apartment’s damp coldness, making fine hairs stand rigidly on end like static charge. A visceral, physical anchor screaming That was real. This is real. Something touched me.\n\n\n\nTried covering the hallway mirror again. Brown kraft paper, half a roll of duct tape. Felt absurdly like warding off vampires with garlic. Stood with my back pressed hard against the opposite wall, didn’t look as I fumbled awkwardly, breath catching shallowly. Ripped it all down less than an hour later in a fresh wave of suffocating panic. The feeling of focused observation hadn’t lessened; it just felt intensely concentrated behind the paper, pressing outwards palpably, more intense and menacing for being unseen. Utterly pointless. It’s not in the mirror. The mirror is just… porous. A weak spot where it looks through. Or maybe, eventually, pushes through.\n\n\n\nStarted noticing the breathing again. Or maybe hearing it more clearly through the fear-fog. Late at night, city quieted to a low hum, sometimes I hear it clearly. A faint, slow, wet inhalation… followed by a long, sighing exhalation that seems to stir the dust motes, carrying a faint but distinct whiff of that sharp metallic\/ozone smell, maybe with burnt hair underneath now. Makes me gag sometimes. Doesn't seem to come from one specific place, more like… the heating vents? Spaces between crumbling plaster walls? Seems subtly timed with unnatural shifts in temperature, pockets of cold air pulsing faintly with the ‘out-breath’. Like the building itself is harnessed as a lung by something parasitic. Using its decay. Maybe that smell near the fuse box is its… respiration? Waste? God, the thoughts feel contaminated, spiraling.\n\n\n\nSearched online again, compulsively, hopelessly. Gave up 'mirror ghosts'. Too simple. Focused on the address, building history, old maps, local historical society archives – anything about the ground itself. Hours lost scrolling faded scans, eyes aching under the laptop glare. Found fragmented references. This specific area called \"Cinder Marsh\" or morbidly \"Wicklow's Mire\" before the city sprawled over it. Unpopular plot. Swampy ground that 'resisted' early drainage attempts according to a dry 1910 engineering report – mentioned inexplicable equipment failures, tool breakages, persistent worker unease bordering on mutiny. Found that chilling snippet again, scanned local newspaper, 1892 – small family homestead near the marsh edge found abruptly abandoned. Doors banging open, half-eaten meal rotting on the table, occupants vanished without trace. Article quoted a frightened neighbor mentioning the family plagued by \"ill-luck, strange reflections seen in the marsh water even on cloudy days, and deeply unsettling mimicry heard in the calls of the night birds.\" Nothing concrete. Just faint whispers across a century of bad ground. A sense of the place itself being inherently wrong. Predatory?\n\n\n\nThe scraping sound came back last night. Against the living room window, slick with cold rain. Louder this time. Sharper. Definitely not fingernails, not branches. More like… shards of rock, or maybe dry, sharp bone, being dragged deliberately, rhythmically across the glass? Scrrreee… pause… skriiiitch… Set my teeth painfully on edge, vibrated deep in my jawbone. Followed by that faint, wet clicking sound again, seemingly coming right off the shivering glass pane itself. Click… click-click… Like something tasting the barrier. Testing its strength. Lasted almost two minutes, an eternity of frozen listening. Sat rigid on the couch, hands balled into white-knuckled fists, sweat trickling cold down my back, until blessed, heavy, watchful silence fell again.\n\n\n\nObject manipulation feels less random now, more… pointedly intrusive. Came back from the bathroom this morning (rapid, eyes-half-closed ordeal) to find my laptop, left closed on the coffee table, now sitting wide open. Screen dark. But sitting squarely on the center of the keyboard, draped over the 'H' key? A single long, dark strand of human hair. Definitely not mine – mine’s light brown, shedding from stress anyway. Whose was it? Felt like a trophy deliberately left behind. Or a territorial marking. Claiming my space, my tools.\n\n\n\nReflection glitches are rare now, almost nonexistent, because the baseline mimicry is so terrifyingly, flawlessly perfect. But when they happen, they’re more disturbing. Caught my reflection in the microwave door glass waiting for water for yet another cup of awful coffee. Just for a split second, the reflection's eyes flickered sideways, unmistakably, towards the butcher block holding my kitchen knives beside the microwave. Head tilted slightly. Lingered. Like thinking about them. Before snapping back instantly to meet my own startled gaze. It wasn't mirroring me; I was staring straight ahead. It was looking independently. Assessing. At the knives. My stomach plummeted, cold and heavy as lead.\n\n\n\nIt’s learning faster. Interacting more deliberately. Sounds, moved objects, the intimate violation of the hair, the independent, assessing glances… feels like it’s consolidating its presence, pushing outwards from the reflections into the physical space. Into my space. Maybe testing what it can affect. Preparing for something more direct.\n\n\n\nTried the landlord again. Voice shaking, trying desperately to sound rational. Mentioned scraping (\"Maybe rats? Big ones?\"), moved objects (framed carefully as intruder concerns, knowing it sounded insane), cold drafts, electrical smell. He sighed, that world-weary landlord sigh. \"Look,\" he said, patience worn thin, \"it's an old building. Makes noises. Maybe get some thicker curtains? Put out some traps yourself if you really think it's rats. I'll send Gary the handyman again next week if you absolutely insist, but honestly, he won't find anything new.\" Pointless. Utterly, terrifyingly pointless. Nobody is coming. Nobody believes me. I am entirely alone with this.\n\n\n\nThe apartment doesn’t feel like my space anymore. It feels occupied. Infiltrated. Like its territory now, and I’m the increasingly inconvenient, maybe interesting, maybe edible, infestation it's patiently studying. Everything feels subtly contaminated. Light feels wrong, too harsh or too dim. Shadows pool in corners with unnatural, watching depth. That metallic tang seems ever-present, coating the back of my throat, a taste I can't wash away. Am I imagining the intensification? Hyper-vigilance feeding paranoia? Breakdown accelerating?\n\n\n\nOr is it really learning? Adapting? Moving from watching and mimicking to… affecting? Preparing for the next stage?\n\n\n\nThe worst part is the constant, gnawing waiting. Knowing the next escalation is coming. Feeling that heavy, listening silence descend, hearing that chitinous scrape on the glass like claws testing the boundary, catching a reflection that isn't quite right for a horrifying split second before the mask snaps flawlessly back into place… and wondering when it will stop pretending altogether. Wondering when the mask will finally drop for good, and what nightmare I’ll see staring back at me from my own eyes."},"12":{"title":"Have you heard of Gravedigger's fever?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgobr5\/have_you_heard_of_gravediggers_fever\/","flair":null,"author":"Carnaloth","selftext":"I want to tell you a story. I really don’t care if you believe me.  I know that what I’m about to say might sound frightening but please don’t be frightened.  Something wonderful has happened to me, and if you’re reading this, I think it could happen to you too.  Let me tell you about a miracle:\n\n\n\nIt was about a month ago that my grandfather passed on due to complications from his stroke late last year.  He and I were very close and after his stroke I had taken care of my grandmother and him the best I could while still making my way through university.  The day of the funeral service it rained like hell.  The ground of the tiny cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe turned to mush underfoot, and a few unfortunate folks got mud all over their funeral blacks.  The service had been incredibly hard for me and because I had a lot of difficulty crying around my family and friends, I decided to stay back from the burial service so I could get a couple minutes to honestly grieve.  That’s when I saw him.\n\n\n\nThe cemetery’s caretaker stood out in the pouring rain looking underdressed and soaked to the bone.  He stood a respectful distance away from the service, clearly not wanting attention but I could tell he was shivering so I walked over with my black umbrella to give him some relief.\n\n\n\nWhen I got closer the first thing I noticed was that he was young.  Under his thick, blond beard he couldn’t have been more than a year or two older than me.  The second thing I noticed was an odour that hung around him, thick and cool.  It wasn’t a terrible smell, more that he smelled like wet, black earth (even more so than the whole world seemed to smell of it in the rain),  and a sort of cinnamony scent I couldn’t quite place.\n\n\n\n“That’s very kind of you sir” he said in a surprisingly soft voice.\n\n\n\n“It’s just that you… well you looked cold” I stammered out, slightly off balance from the age, the smell, and now the voice.  The caretaker gestured out to the mass of black umbrellas and solemn faces.\n\n\n\n“Who was he to you?” he asked in that soft, almost cautious voice.\n\n\n\n“My Grandfather…  I loved him dearly” I said, the second half of the sentence falling lame even to my own ears.\n\n\n\n“You and all those people out there,” he gestured with a long-nailed hand out to my friends and family. “I’ve worked this plot for a long time; seen all sorts go into the earth.  You can always tell when it was a well-loved one.  Something in the faces of the mourners… I can’t quite explain but it’s there” He picked each word carefully like an artist selecting just the right brush.  As he spoke I caught a whiff of his breath and the smell that hung around him hit me even harder, this time less pleasant and with an underlying rank sweetness.\n\n\n\n“How long have you worked here?” I inquired, eager to change the subject as my roiling emotions threatened to bubble over again.\n\n\n\n“A good long while now, I don’t bother keeping track.  The work’s rewarding and this is a good place.  A calm and quiet place…” his face spoke of a life that hadn’t always been full of calm and quiet places.  I couldn’t disagree with him though, despite the rain or maybe even because of it the cemetery had almost an ethereal stillness and looking over the well-cleaned headstones I could see how this place could be someone’s haven if not mine.   We made a sort of gentle conversation that slowly spun out into silence.  Then we stood for a while, listening to the rain patter on the fabric of the umbrella we shared and watching the service from afar.  It wasn’t until just before I was about to excuse myself to return to the last minutes of the service that he spoke again.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think most people would have shared their umbrella.” he mused without looking away from the mourners and meeting my eyes.\n\n\n\n“Why’s that?” I asked, startled out of my thoughts.\n\n\n\n“They’re uncomfortable with people like me, people who are… proximate to death and decay.  Thank you for being different, and thank you for the conversation.  I think it’s time you get back to your grandfather, they’re about to begin the lowering.” he offered one of his long-nailed hands.  I took it with only the slightest hesitation.  His grip was strong, painfully so.  As he squeezed my hand he leaned in, breath stinking of the grave he said: “Good deeds are rewarded my friend, run along now.”.   The biting grip disappeared as quick as it came on and I did my best to politely excuse myself without appearing shaken.  I didn’t notice until later but those long snaggled fingernails had bitten into the meat of my right hand in two places forming a shallow v-shaped cut. \n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThere was a small reception after at my grandparent’s house.  We told stories about my grandfather, some of which I had never heard until then.  It felt like once the ritual of viewing and funeral and burial were complete, my grandfather had somehow become a real person again if that makes any sense.  I felt closer to him then than I had when I was helping to carry the casket.  The house seemed to hold something of his presence that his cold body couldn’t match.  I never expected a funeral to have snacks but the reception had tons of food, none of which I had much of an appetite for.\n\n\n\nEventually I excused myself, I was exhausted and I had to get ready for school  the next day.  As I left my grandmother insisted I take some of my grandfather’s brandy with me.  She said she wouldn’t drink it anyway and that brandy is good for the constitution.  When I asked her why that was important she said with simple finality “you just look a bit pale that’s all”.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThat night I dreamed of the cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe.  I dreamed of the silent headstones at night, how the place would look lit only by the streetlight spilling over the high wall that surrounded it.  I dreamed that I was late to my grandfather’s funeral, that I was dressed in my blacks and my dress shoes were getting stuck in the sucking, grasping mud and when I finally made it to the grave everybody was long gone.  I had something that I meant to give my grandfather before he was buried, a little silver fork, and so I began to dig with my hands into the filled grave so that I could give him this one last thing and he could give me something that I wanted in return.  As I dug into the soaked earth the smell of the grave filled my nose and my stomach bubbled and stirred uncomfortably.  I excavated my way down, silver fork held in my teeth before my nails scratched on the lid of the coffin.  Suddenly the flash of lamplight came over me and….\n\n\n\nI woke up in a feverish sweat,  my mouth full of a gungey, unclean, sick taste.  My bones ached and I knew immediately that I would not be making it to class today.  I lay a while in my sticky-damp sheets, the dream was still pressed into the forefront of my consciousness.  The pure illogic of it bemused me.  My fevered brain raked over the details of the dream.  Only as I pulled my mind away from the empty, sodden cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe did I realize just how hungry I was.\n\n\n\nIn all the events of yesterday I had completely forgotten to eat.  I hadn’t had any appetite at the reception and once I had got home I had been too preoccupied by my grief and preparations for school.  When I awoke, fevered as I was, I was starving.  \n\n\n\nI peeled myself out of my sheets and walked tenderly through my apartment.  I filled a glass with water and sucked it down to try to soothe my aching head.  It did no good.  When I opened my refrigerator a pungent cacophony of odours hit me in waves.  I slammed the fridge door shut before the smell made me sick.  *Has something gone off in there?*  I wondered to myself.  The worst part was that the horrible smell hadn’t allayed my hunger for more than a few seconds.  I grabbed a piece of bread and started chewing it but the texture suddenly felt all wrong and I hadn’t gotten more than bite down when I had to run to my sick to wretch.  Bent over the sink, quivering with tremors and smelling my own thin vomit, I realized that maybe the best thing I could do for myself was to go back to bed.\n\n\n\nAfter I sent off a few short emails to my professors explaining that I was ill, I decided I would shower off the tacky sweat residue that clung to my skin.  As I reached for my soap in the shower I noticed something strange on my hand.  At first I thought it was an inkstain but when I inspected the v-shaped mark on the bottom of my right hand I realized that the two small cuts the caretaker’s fingernails had made had scabbed over completely black.\n\n\n\nI was immediately worried that the cut had become infected or something but there was no inflammation and when I prodded it gently it didn’t sting any more than your typical scab.  After I finished my shower I opted to dab some polysporin on and around it and go back to my bed.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI took a long while getting back to sleep between the fever and the stomach cramping hunger but when I did my dreams were strange again.  I dreamed of family dinners and the cemetery.  I dreamed of the Caretaker with his shovel.  I dreamed of him filling graves and emptying them.  I dreamed about the sound a shovel makes when it hits the roof of a casket, like the sound of a pirate striking buried treasure.  I dreamed of smelling that damp dirt and cinnamon smell and when I woke late in the evening my fever had grown far worse and my mouth was watering.\n\n\n\nI was getting worse.  I was a pale and shaking mess, completely unable to keep a bite of solid food down.  When I tried a sip of my grandfather’s brandy I nearly spat it out.  A rancid flavour had surpassed even the burn of alcohol in it.  I resolved to drink only water until this flu or fever had passed and I shivered out the rest of the evening on my couch trying to distract myself from the viscous combination of malaise and hunger.  I dozed intermittently but always started awake from strange dreams full of gravedirt.\n\n\n\nForty eight hours after my grandfather’s funeral I decided I was going to go to the emergency room.  The fever was bad, the hunger was worse.  I had wondered if I was well enough to drive but ultimately decided that if this was contagious, it would be best for everyone if I tried to avoid exposing anyone.\n\n\n\nBy the time I had walked out to my car, my heart was racing with effort and a cloud of lightheadedness hung over me.  I sat in my car for a full eight minutes before I felt clear headed enough to start it.  Even as I started to drive, I wondered if I was making a terrible mistake in trying to drive.  My attention kept wandering and I would lose seconds at a time, realizing I had run a yellow light or missed a turn.  My eyes kept straying to brightly lit fast food signs but I knew as soon as the greasy paper bag was passed over to me I wouldn’t be able to take a single bite.  I rolled down my window to get some cool air on my face, that’s when I realized where I was.\n\n\n\nThe smell washed over me and I felt my stomach growl maddeningly.  It took a moment to identify.  It was rich and cool, a simultaneously wet and dry odour.  It was herby with an earthy note and the slightest hint of fruitiness.  I had visions of sweet, cool fruits being pulled from rich, damp earth.  My focus drifted in the tantalising presence of this smell until….\n\n\n\nThe squawk of a car horn behind me snapped me out of my daze.  The light at the intersection of Elk and Siemens had changed to green and I had been idling in front of it for who knows how long.  I goosed the gas pedal, eyes scanning for the source of the delicious smell when I saw it.  The next intersection was Elk and Monroe.  The cemetery gate on the corner stood wide open flanked by stone angels and as I drove towards it the sensations of smell and hunger threatened to overwhelm me matched only by my internal horror.  How could it be?  How could it smell so… right?  There was nothing for me there — only the headstones, the dirt, and, deep within the earth, gently mouldering, fermenting, the many corpses with their pale flesh…\n\n\n\nI pulled away from the thought like it was a fat, black spider discovered walking over my pillow.  *It was the fever, it’s making me delirious,* I reasoned to myself.  I immediately turned off the street that led to the cemetery gates and in a daze drove halfway home before I remembered I had planned to go to the hospital.  I was so desperate to get distance away from those gates and that horrid, wonderful smell that I couldn’t even bring myself to turn back.  Fatigue was washing over me in dark waves and if not for the bone deep horror that gripped me I might have fallen asleep at the wheel.  \n\n\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment I pulled into my stall at a steep angle and stumbled to the elevator, resting my burning head against the cool metal of the elevator door frame as I waited for its arrival.  *I’ll call 911 tomorrow if I’m not better*, I bargained with myself.  When I got into my apartment fever had turned to chills and I hid under the sheets, body quaking and mind reeling.  Even as I lay there, horror mingled with wanting into a primordial stew of feeling.  Red and black fantasies played at the edge of my brain before swallowing me whole as I drifted off to uneasy sleep.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIn those dreams I was a farmer in a field of dark soil and pale stones.  I moved confidently with hoe and shovel, digging and planting deep within the earth.  I pulled a strange and lovely crop from the ground and ate it under the stars.  I was content.  I basked in the night’s breeze and drew in the odour of the land and my harvest mouldering below its surface and I was so at peace.  But it was only a dream.  I awoke.\n\n\n\nThe fever had broken; the hunger had grown.  When my eyes snapped open in the night-black room, I knew where my medicine was.  The world had shrunk into a single point of rough need and I rose from the chill sheets with a blank-minded purpose.  Time slipped, I was in the car.  The blue dashboard clock read 2:55.  I watched the streetlamps float past my car and I rolled down my windows.  I breathed deeply of the night air and I caught the faintest hint of it on the wind.  Time slipped, the car had stopped. I had pulled into the parking lot.  Behind me the intersection lights cast a pale green hue over the scene.  The smell was so thick you could cut it with a knife.  The stone angels seemed to beckon me in with outstretched hands. The gate was open even though the sign said it was closed.   I took the first step on the gravel path.  Time slipped, I was on my knees, a headstone out in front of me.  I must have looked from afar like some midnight mourner but I hadn’t even read the name.  I stared down into the dirt and saw I had already begun ripping up the sod revealing the pregnant soil beneath.  Was there one last ounce of hesitation in me? No, I don't think there was.  I could smell her waiting for me down there, six feet of earth and it still filled my nose like honey.  I began to dig with my hands, desperately scrabbling at the earth.  Pull out great hunks of black earth, dirt forcing itself under my nails, small rocks cutting my palms.  I didn’t care.  I began to weep as I realised I couldn’t possibly do this without a shovel or some tool.  That’s when the light washed over me and my heart froze.\n\n\n\nIt was him.  The caretaker stood with an ancient hurricane lantern in hand, its light casting stark shadows over his face.  In this light he looked far older than I remembered.  I had frozen, dirt in both hands at the sight of him.  I opened my mouth to say… something, and all that came out were thick rivulets of drool.  My mind raced, the smell drove me to dig, my brain drove me to run.  I had almost decided on trying to bludgeon the caretaker and make a run for it when he spoke in that soft voice:\n\n\n\n“You poor boy, you must be starving.” his eyes were solemn as he looked at me.  Could it have been empathy?\n\n\n\n“I–I can explain…” I started, no idea what I was going to say, overwhelmed completely.\n\n\n\n“You don’t have to, just come with me.  Let's set you right.” He said.  There was perhaps the faintest hint of a smile on his face then, perhaps it was just a trick of the guttering lamplight.  I let the dirt fall from my blackened hands and rose from my knee-deep hole in the earth.\n\n\n\n“What’s happening to me?” I asked.  The shame ran back into me like a flood and I began to blubber again, spit and snot mingling around my mouth.\n\n\n\n“There, there my boy.” The caretaker closed the distance between us and held me in his arms for a minute before he looked me in the eyes with utter seriousness. “Something wonderful, I promise.  You’ll be feeling right as rain if you just walk with me now.  You’ve come a very long way but you only have a few more steps.”.  He began to lead me gently down the path.  Gravel crunched underfoot and was the only sound in the silence of the cemetery.  I saw that we were coming to the caretaker’s workshop.  It was a small white building, almost a church in miniature.  From within, unsteady candlelight burned.  \n\n\n\nWe entered to the smell of motor oil and sawdust and above it all, the heavenly odour of the rotted dead.  When we came to the workshop’s back room, the table was already set.  Fine china and small silver forks and wicked sharp knives, set for two.  The centerpiece of the wide table was a long oak coffin, half rotted away.  Candles had been placed at the corners of the coffin and the caretaker bade me sit at one of the set places.  Reaching into his coat pocket he brought out a crowded keychain and carefully selected one.  He slid it into the lock and as I heard the click of it coming open it was all I could do not to leap from my chair and push him aside as the smell of tantalizing rot seemed to double in the room.  He spoke some words then, some I understood and some that I did not.  It was a benediction of sorts, a thanksgiving.  \n\n\n\n“Blessed is the carrion and blessed in he who tasteth the graveyard’s fruit.  We thank the ground for yielding her gifts to us. We thank the stars for sheltering us.  We thank the empty vessel for remembering life, that it may be passed to us.  Blessed are we by dark earth and black heavens, that we shall feast tonight.” He spoke it with whispered ritual cadence.  Then, the small silver knife was in his hands and he was cutting.  I watched as he deftly split rotted flesh from the corpse of a woman.  The meat was dry in places, wet in others; it was speckled with pale purples and reds.  He started with the cheek.  He separated it with a few quick strokes revealing pale jaw and teeth underneath and then he set it on my plate.  “Take. Eat. *Live*.” The three words were in the same ritual cadence and as soon as he spoke I descended on the meat with the desperation of a drowning man.\n\n\n\nIt was like nothing I had ever tasted.  Black, greasy, mealy, and yet sweeter than honeydew.  More intoxicating than wine.  It satisfied the indescribable need that bound itself in tight coils throughout my body.  It was pure relief.  The caretaker placed slice after slice of the prime cuts on my plate and my aching, screaming hunger was finally answered.  When I had eaten my fill, the caretaker set a few pieces on his own plate and then closed and locked the coffin lid.  As I sat in a warm haze of emotion and satiation he broke the silence.\n\n\n\nHe spoke to me of many things that long and deep night.  I will not tell you most of it.  He spoke to me of dark earth, old countries, and ancient laws.  He told me of his life, long and sweet, how he had worked plots like these since he was an apprentice under a master far older than he was even now.  That night he showed me the grandness of what I had become, the beauty and the comfort of it.  He offered me a job.  He offered me a life.  When I asked him why choose me his answer was simple.\n\n\n\n“When we met I told you that good deeds should be rewarded, yes?  I have no greater gift for you than this” he gestured at the dining ware and the candles burning low, “I am in need of an apprentice besides.  I chose you because nobody had shared an umbrella with me in my long years of this work, few have ever shared more than a couple terse words with me. I scrub the headstones clean, keep the plots free of weeds.  In my work I have done nothing but bring closure and comfort and I am made a pariah for it. I have never done harm to the living, have never taken anything that wasn’t willingly surrendered to the earth.  I have lived a graceful but lonely life since I came to this country and I want to share the goodness of it with somebody.  It seemed right that it was you.”.  It did seem right.\n\n\n\nI’ve been working at the cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe for three months now.  I’ve dropped out of university, I’m just too busy.  The hours are good; the company is excellent.  Six days a week in the shade of the cemetery, where the air is sweet and cool.  \n\n\n\nLooking back, I do not know what I was afraid of.  The illness is already a distant memory and the reward was more than enough.  As for the appetites, The Caretaker is right, we don’t take anything that wasn’t given to our cemetery.  We serve in the moment of people’s mourning and are paid our wages under the sheltering night sky.  The Caretaker has been very pleased with my work.  Even with the two of us we’re just so busy, I have no idea how he managed it alone for so long.  The dead keep coming in the gates, carried on the shoulders of their loved ones, and we plant them deep in our soil to ripen.  I think he’ll be hiring again soon, we just need to find the right fit.  Stop by some day if you’re in the area.  We’re on the corner of Elk and Monroe, we’d love to say hello and shake your hand."},"13":{"title":"I Killed My Mom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgv05q\/i_killed_my_mom\/","flair":null,"author":"OneAirport8428","selftext":"\n\nI was 13 when we moved to Ashfield. In the summer of ’97, the bulls won their back-to-back championship, Oasis released their third album, and I thought girls were stupid. I still remember the smell of beer and sausages entering my room through the window. Mom was a big fan of inviting the neighbors for a grill party every Sunday, honestly I hated it. She forced me to play with the neighbors’ children to “socialize “. They were weird. We did not share one common thing. I wore Jordans, they wore church shoes.\n\n \n\n I had one good pal, his name was Jimmy. We were the troublemakers of Ashfield. Why am I telling you all of this? For a specific reason, Jimmy found something in my garden that would change my whole life. What he found taught me a valuable lesson. Even dark desires want to be fulfilled.\n\nMy mom called me to help her to set up the wooden table we had that stood in our garden.\n\n“Mike, stop listening to his rap music crap of yours and help your mother.”\n\nI rolled my eyes, luckily she did not see that or she would have spanked me so hard I would not have been able to sit for 3 days. I loved my mom, but she was tough. It was not easy for her, raising me alone after my dad died in a car crash.\n\n \n\nI entered the garden, wearing baggy shorts and my bulls jersey, she wore her favorite summer dress.\n\n“Mike, I told you many times to stop looking like a thug. Why can’t you dress normally like the other children?”\n\n“The other children are boring.” I went to the kitchen, I grabbed the plates, forks and knives. When I went back to the garden I saw, mom was talking to our Neighbor Mr. Jenkins. I hated his guts, he always smelled cheap after shave and cigarettes. He always flirted with mom, and she did it back. One day I can remember hearing strange sounds from Mom’s bedroom. Jimmy said they had probably sex, I did not believe it.\n\n“Hey Champ, how are you today?”\n\n“Good.”\n\nMy mom slapped the back of my head. She wanted me to be nicer to our neighbor. I did not care.\n\nI never understood why he always called me champ, only my dad called me like this. Maybe this was one of the reasons I hated him so deeply. \n\nI thought my day was ruined but then I heard Jimmy shouting from the other side of our fence.\n\n“Yo, my mom allowed me to take Rex to your party.” Rex was his German shepherd, the best dog in the world. I opened the door for him. We dapped each other up, and I patted Rex.\n\n“Mom, can we and Jimmy go to my room and listen to music?”\n\n“Sure my dear but the dog will not enter the house.”\n\n \n\nAs we entered my room, he pulled something out of his pockets.\n\n“I stole the cigs of my dad, lets try them. They must be good when all the adults are smoking them.”\n\n“I don’t know, my mom is gonna kill me when she finds out I smoked.”\n\n“Come on, don’t be a pussy. Even the lover of your mom is smoking cigs.”\n\nI pushed him hard, “He is not the lover of my mom, dickhead.”\n\n“Whatever, let's smoke one.” He lit the cigarette, he tried it first. I can only remember how bad they tasted. Me and him were probably coughing for five minutes after that. I never touched a cigarette after that. I knew I did something wrong, but the feeling of doing something forbidden was fun. The little rush we got doing stupid things only we knew about made It worth it. We opened the window and sprayed some cologne in my room to hide the smell of the cigs, in hindsight very stupid because every adult would still smell them immediately but we were kids.\n\nRex was barking at something in my garden and it bothered the early guests that arrived. My told Jimmy to come down and to calm down his dog or bring Rex back to his home. We both rushed down, to see what was going on with Rex. He was in the back of the garden, barking at the ground. As we arrived he started to dig a hole. I panicked because my mom would have definitely killed me if she would have seen that.\n\n“Tell Rex to stop or I am going to die.”\n\n“Calm down, let me handle this.” Jimmy always had this calm attitude when things went wrong and I admired him for that but in this moment he pissed me off. First the cigs and now the hole, I felt like he really wanted me to be in trouble. Jimmy calmed down Rex but he was suspiciously quiet. Normally, Jimmy never shuts up. He called me over. I saw a small hole and between the mud and dirt was a little black box, nothing was special about it.\n\n“Why is there a black box buried in your garden?”\n\n“I don’t know, maybe the previous owner buried it.”\n\n“We need to see what’s in there.”\n\nI took the box and tried to open it, but my spaghetti arms were too weak.\n\n“You need a key, dickhead.” was Jimmy’s smart ass response.\n\nI went to my mom with the box, I thought maybe she knew something about it. She was talking to Jenkins, both were really drunk and very touchy. It made me sick to my stomach, I saw a knife laying on the table. My first instinct was to drop the box, grab the knife and cut Jenkins open like a pig.\n\n \n\nBut before I could finish my murderous fantasy, someone grabbed me by my arm and dragged me into the living room. It was Rebecca, but I always called her Becky.\n\n“What do you want from me, Becky?”\n\n“Nothing, but you looked like you wanted to kill someone so I got curious.”\n\n“None of your business.”\n\nShe pointed at the black box that I was still holding in my hands. Becky was like every other girl, simply annoying.\n\n“Again, it’s none of your business. Go to the other girls and play with some Barbies or something.” I always played it cool around girls, Jimmy told me that's what they really like. She came close to me, I could feel her breath. I thought she would kiss me so I closed my eyes. She whispered in my ear.\n\n“Everyone in Ashfield knows your mom is fucking Jenkins.”\n\nI got taught to never punch a girl, mom told me this. It was weird because I saw my dad sometimes slapping my mom but I respected it. At this moment I did not care if she was a girl, I wanted to smash her head in with the box. I opened my eyes but she was gone already.\n\n\n\nLater in the evening, I was laying down in my bed, reading some comics. Jimmy left long ago and only a few people were left at the party. I could not sleep, it was hard to sleep when people were talking loudly and listening to this disgusting country music.\n\nI was thirsty, so I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. When I went past my moms bedroom, I could hear some noises. I opened the door but only a little to get a peak. I saw Jenkins fat back and he was on top of my mom.\n\n“You like when i fuck you like this you dirty whore.”\n\n“ I bet i fuck you better than your husband.”\n\nMy whole body was shaking, Jimmy was right. She was really having sex with Jenkins. Tears formed in my eyes from anger. I stormed into my room. The black box was standing on my desk, looking at me. It was weird, the box was closed the whole day but when I entered my room it was open. I went to the box to see what was inside. It was a picture, a picture of a corpse. A woman's body lying in a bed, she was naked.  I turned the picture around and with red letters it was written.\n\n“Kill her.”\n\nI put the picture back into the box, I thought it was one of Jimmy’s pranks. I laid on my bed but what I saw in my mom’s bedroom did not leave my mind. I cried my eyes out from anger, I wish she and Jenkins would die. I could not take it. I took my backpack and I wanted to run away, I did not know where to go. I simply wanted to leave.\n\n \n\nAgain, the box looked at me, I decided to look at the picture for the last time. I recognized something in the picture, the blankets and pillows next to the corpse looked like the one mom had. It clicked for me, the picture told me to kill my mom. I started to shake from anxiety, my head was spinning. I wanted to vomit, but then I remembered what I saw.\n\n \n\nI went to the kitchen, to get the biggest knife possible. I had the picture on my pockets, I was still unsure but everytime i started to doubt, I remember Jenkins fat back moving up and down. I went back to the bedroom of my mom. Slow and quiet steps, I prayed that Jenkins was still there so I could kill him too. Again I slowly opened the door, he was not there but mom was sleeping. With every step I took closer to my mom, my determination to kill her grew, it was growing witch each step.\n\n \n\nI stood next to her, I carefully removed the blanket, she was laying there naked. Her Breasts fully exposed. I could smell his cheap aftershave on her. I started to stab her, I was in a trance. She screamed but out of reflex I stabbed her in the throat and then she sounded like she was drowing. I stabbed her till my arms gave out. My upper body was covered in her blood. She was a bloody mess. I took the picture out of my pocket, she looked exactly like the woman in the picture. She was the woman in the picture.\n\n \n\nI felt relieved, I did not even process what I did. I cleaned myself up, and went to Jenkins House. I broke into it, and I entered his bedroom. I did not kill him, I placed the knife in his hands and went back home. I called the police, and Jenkins got arrested.\n\n \n\nThat all was 28 Years ago, Jenkins is still in prison. From time to time I look at the picture. After I killed my mom, the red letters disappeared. There was a new message on the back.\n\n“Good job, Champ.”"},"14":{"title":"Marble Veins","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khg1dv\/marble_veins\/","flair":null,"author":"PTVincent","selftext":"I’ll remember that night forever; jet black eyes, ash in my lungs. It still watches me\n\nIt began in second grade, on a morning so normal I almost forgot it. I tied my shoes, slapped together a peanut‑butter‑and‑jelly sandwich, and packed my brand‑new Spider‑Man backpack.\n\nBy the time I boarded the bus to the museum, excitement ran throughout my body like electricity. I bounced out of the cracked leather seat and leaned so far out of the aisle I almost fell. That’s when the old bus driver, Miss Marge, cracked her raspy voice like a whip from the front of the bus: “Sit down!”\n\nI dropped back into my seat. Her deep, sunken eyes and the smoky scent that lingered around her were enough to pause my heartbeat. Luckily, I had Landon beside me. We’d met on the first day of school, where we bonded over Ben 10 and our Pokémon cards. Now, he gave me a teasing grin that told me to behave.\n\n“She scares me,” I whispered to Landon, ducking my head while peering around the seat at Miss Marge’s rigid silhouette. Her knuckles were white as bone as she gripped the dark rubber of the wheel.\n\nWhen we arrived at the museum, we gathered with the teachers and chaperones in front of the museum’s decorated entrance. They started to divide us into groups of three, assigning us the job of looking after one another and keeping each other in check. I was excited when Ms. Landers met my eyes and called my name.\n\n“David, you’re going to be in a group with Landon…” She glanced around, searching for any other students who hadn’t found their pod yet. My heart sank as I realized only one classmate remained unassigned. “…was Jenny.”\n\nTo put it kindly, Jenny was a troublemaker. Last week, she had put gum in a classmate's hair, and they had to cut it out. I’d never willingly spoken to her before, but now I had no choice. Under Ms. Landers watchful gaze, I forced myself forward. My palms began sweating as I approached her, extending my hand, but before I could say a word, she pushed me away, eyes narrowed with irritation.\n\n“I’m not talking to either of you” Jenny hissed before disappearing into the swarm of students. Ms. Landers gave a weary sigh. I could tell she was exhausted from dealing with rowdy kids, and Jenny was just another burden on her shoulders. Leaning down to my level, she spoke gently.\n\n“I’ll talk to her about her behavior,” she said. “Let me know if you have any trouble with her during the tour—I’ll help right away.” I nodded, relieved to know I had backup if things went sideways.\n\nThe tour around the museum was exciting; the halls were decorated and loomed far over our heads, giving the space a sense of grandeur. Landon and I couldn’t help but laugh when we passed the prehistoric human section. The wax figures had broad foreheads, big nostrils, and funny facial expressions as they sat frozen on a log.\n\n“That one looks like Miss Marge,” Landon said, giggling and pointing at the figure that held a rock while examining it. I laughed with him as we pretended to hold spears and act like our early ancestors.\n\nWe passed a closed exhibit as we walked. The hall was dimly lit and cordoned off by velvet ropes, casting eerie shadows over several marble statues positioned throughout the space. Squinting, I thought there was the faintest flicker of movement among the statues, but the distance and darkness made it impossible to tell.\n\nAhead of me, Jenny called out to the tour guide, pointing toward the roped‑off area. “Can we go there next?”\n\nThe tour guide offered her a polite, apologetic smile. “That’s actually a new exhibit still under construction. It’ll be at least another month before it’s ready, I’m afraid.”\n\nJenny didn’t reply. Instead, her expression soured, and she stared beyond the ropes, fixated on whatever had captured her interest in the shadows.\n\nOut of all the exhibits we explored, the dinosaurs captivated me the most. Standing beneath the towering skeleton of a triceratops filled me with wonder. I vividly imagined it alive, its horns sharp and imposing. Then my imagination took another turn, picturing a fierce battle between it and a T. rex.\n\nWhile lost in my daydream, I barely noticed Landon nudging my shoulder. “Hey, have you seen Jenny anywhere? I haven’t seen her for a little while.” I snapped back to reality and took a moment to survey the area. Scanning the faces of the other students, I realized that Landon was right; Jenny was nowhere to be seen.\n\n“Where do you think she went?” I asked, but Landon responded with a shrug and a mumbled, “I dunno.”\n\nFrustrated with the turn of events, I said, “I’m going to go find her before the teacher notices. I don’t want us to get in trouble because we lost her; you just wait here.” With that, I slipped away from the rest of the class and went farther into the museum. I passed paintings, old artifacts, maps, and more, but there was no sight of her. Growing concerned, I broke into a brisk jog, leaving little clacks on the floor as I went.\n\nI slowed when I reached the closed sculpture gallery. I glanced over the sign propped near the front entrance that detailed how the gallery came to be. Many of these statues had recently been unearthed within a Pompeii dig site, which left me remembering the stories our history teacher told us. Men, women, children, and pets had been suffocated under the ash of a volcano that not even their gods could stop. The history made my heart ache and my stomach twist.\n\n Past the sign, a biting cold blew from the darkness emanating from the area, making me want to continue my search somewhere else. However, looking into the dark, I saw Jenny walking through the exhibit and disappearing past my view. A feeling of responsibility drove me to continue.\n\nI gripped the straps of my backpack and pretended to be like Spider-Man as I crawled into the closed‑off area. The smell of cleaning products lingered in the air, but it couldn’t mask the hints of old stone dust. Walking through the darkness, I was distracted by what I saw.\n\nDetailed busts and complete statues made from marble surrounded me from every angle. Some of them were clearly ancient, with brown stains lining the creases of their clothes and the wrinkles of their faces. Others looked newer, as if they had either been polished or cleaned specifically for this exhibit. Yet that wasn’t what scared me.\n\nEach of their expressions were filled with fear and anguish. Wide eyes, open mouths, and silent screams were expertly portrayed. If they hadn’t been made out of stone, I would have expected them to blink and breathe.\n\nThe room grew darker as I walked deeper inside; my footsteps echoed against the floor throughout the quiet darkness. The statues’ stares seemed to fall on me. I didn’t want to spend any longer there than I had to, so I started calling out for my missing group member.\n\n“Jenny, where are you? We need to go back with everyone else, or we’ll get in trouble.” My words were met with silence. “Jenny, come on!”. When I made my way around the corner, I was stunned by what I saw.\n\nJenny was standing in front of a sculpture carved from jet‑black stone. It depicted a nude man, towering at least ten feet tall, with black colored ash surrounding his feet. Rippling muscles stretched beneath his stone skin, veins snaking down his forearms like living tendrils. He looked almost alive.\n\nAs I turned my attention back to Jenny, I noticed she held a stick of chalk she must have stolen from the classroom. Without remorse, she quickly started scribbling along the black leg with the chalk, which left large white streaks. I sprinted over to her and wrestled it out of her hand before she could continue.\n\n“What are you doing? We have to clean that off!” I whispered with the force of a shout as I tried to use the cloth from my shirt to wipe away the graffiti, which only spread the mark as Jenny laughed.\n\n“You’re so annoying it’s just chalk, nobody’s gonna care.” I rolled my eyes and continued to clean the mess she created. As I went, I thought I saw the shadow cast from the statue move ever so slightly, but upon closer inspection, I didn’t notice anything different besides a small cloud of dust falling from its hand.\n\nAfter I finished wiping away as much of the chalk I could, I turned to Jenny and grabbed her by the wrist as I pulled her away from the statues and out of the exhibit. “We need to get back to class before the teacher finds out what you did.” She was quick to scratch my arm and pull away.\n\n“Don’t touch me! I’m not done here!” She yelled as I shushed her, trying to keep the situation under control. That was until I saw the statue she had written on was staring directly at us with a feverish scowl. He looked almost alive as his curled fingers reached toward Jenny. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. Slowly, his hand reached further until it almost caressed her hair.\n\nWithout any control over my body, a scream tore from my throat. Instantly, the statue’s head snapped toward me, its movements unnervingly fluid. Then, without a sound, it stepped back onto its podium, freezing in place once more. But its face had changed, twisted with fury, its eyes burning into mine; it knew I had seen it move. Jenny turned to look behind herself, but hadn’t noticed what I saw and laughed.\n\n“What are you yelling about, scaredy‑cat? Did one of the statues make you pee yourself?” she taunted, but I didn’t fully process what she said. I couldn’t find the strength to move or speak; my eyes stayed latched to the statues. I feared if I looked away, he would move again.\n\n“Hey… are you OK, weirdo?” Jenny continued, her tone gentle. I grabbed her by the wrist and started sprinting with her to the exit as I ignored her protests. As we ran, I looked over my shoulder, and the statue had changed position. With an almost bony finger, he pointed directly at me.\n\nBy the time we made it far enough away from the gallery, we were both out of breath, and Jenny shot me a nasty glare.\n\n“What’s wrong with you? What are you freaking out about?” she spat, but I could tell my actions had scared her a little as well.\n\n“There was a statue… it tried to grab you,” I said, knowing she wouldn’t believe me. In response, Jenny rolled her eyes at me.\n\n“Stop messing with me,” Jenny said, her voice wavering despite her harsh words. She crossed her arms defensively, but I noticed how her eyes kept darting back toward the gallery entrance. “Just… leave me alone, loser.” She started walking back toward the rest of the class, shoulders hunched. I hurried after her, heart still hammering in my chest. Despite our differences, I couldn’t let myself be alone after what I had just seen.\n\nOnce we made it back to the tour, I saw Landon looking around the museum for the two of us, and once we made eye contact the furrow in his brow relaxed. Without anyone noticing, Jenny and I merged back into the group and Landon started to ask questions. “Where did she go, and why are you so red?”\n\nI didn’t know how to respond at first. I wondered if I should tell him about the statue, but I wasn’t even sure if what I saw was real or my imagination. “She was in the statue room; after I found her, we ran back to the group so we wouldn’t get in trouble.” Landon seemed satisfied, and we went back to listening to the tour guide, but I couldn’t focus. Something was watching me.\n\nIt was instinctive; I was prey under the watchful eye of a predator. Yet no matter where I looked, I saw nothing that could be causing this reaction in me. But I could smell it. Old stone and ash assaulted my nose, pungent and sharp in the air.\n\nThe rest of the tour was uneventful, the excitement I had for the trip drained from my body and was filled with dread. The bus ride home was quiet, I barely spoke and Landon noticed. “Are you ok? You look worried.”\n\nI shook my head, offering a flat smile. “I’m ok… just tired.” The conversation ended there. A few minutes passed in silence before I noticed Jenny glancing at me from across the aisle. She shifted in her seat, eyes flicking away when I caught her looking. Then, with exaggerated nonchalance, she patted the empty space beside her. Once, then twice, like she wasn’t sure why she was doing it until I sat next to her.\n\n“Hey, you were just messing with me earlier… right?” I felt bad that she was scared, but I wanted to be honest with her.\n\n“No, I wasn’t lying. The statue tried to grab you after you drew on it. That’s why I grabbed you and ran.”\n\nJenny went silent for a moment and looked out the window as she quietly spoke. “I didn’t think it would…” She fell silent for a moment before continuing. “I’m going to punch you if you’re lying” She paused. “But… thanks.”\n\nWhen I made it home, the sun had started to set. I walked inside and was met with the smell of dinner. My mom worked over the pot while my father cleaned the used dishes. When I walked into the kitchen, they both greeted me happily. “Hey bud, how was the trip?” My dad asked.\n\nI tried my best to skirt around the subject. “It was good… I’m exhausted, though, so I’m going to go to bed.” Mom’s brow arched.\n\n“Aren’t you hungry, Hun? You’ve been out all day.”\n\nI shook my head no. “I ate some snacks my friends had on the bus.” This was enough for my parents to let me go to bed early. I walked quietly up the stair into my room and closed the door. I fell into my bed, and for the first time after seeing the statue, I felt safe. I cradled myself in my blankets and pillows and fell fast asleep.\n\nAs I slowly awoke, I felt that my fingers were half numb and snot ran down from my nose. My room was dark and cold, and I shivered as I sat up and wrapped myself completely in my covers. It took a few minutes to realize my window had been opened, with my curtains blowing softly in the crisp autumn air. The wind carried a faint familiar scent. The smell of ash and stone.\n\nThe cold of my room intensified ten-fold as I became suffocated by the stench. It laid thick in the air, but there was no sign of what caused it. Slowly, I stood up from my bed, still wrapped in my covers. I made my way to the window and I froze. Along the windowsill were smudges — long, pale fingerprints, smooth and ridgeless, as if carved in wax. My stomach twisted. The window was two stories off the ground.\n\nFear left my arms paralyzed at my side. My room was on the second floor of my house, far out of reach of anyone who could have wanted inside. I slammed the window shut and locked it in place while trying to slow my heart.\n\nWatching me at the edge of the forest line, fully exposed in the moonlight, stood the statue. The large chalk stain along his shin stood illuminated by the moon. In front of him was a shallow grave carved from the grass and earth.  His face grew into a vicious smile and, ever so slowly, his hand raised higher until it pointed directly at me through the window.\n\n  \n"},"15":{"title":"I found something in the woods behind my house that I wish I could forget","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgqj09\/i_found_something_in_the_woods_behind_my_house\/","flair":null,"author":"Superb_Tune4135","selftext":"\nI need to tell someone about this. I haven't slept properly in days, and I'm starting to see things in the corners of my vision. Maybe writing it down will help, or maybe one of you will know what to do. I don't know anymore.\n\nMy house sits at the edge of a small town in northern Maine. The backyard extends about fifty feet before it meets the treeline of a dense forest that stretches for miles. I've lived here for three years and have hiked those woods countless times without incident. At least until last week.\n\nI was walking my usual trail last Wednesday afternoon. It was unseasonably warm for May, and I wanted to enjoy the sunshine before the inevitable rain came back. About two miles in, I noticed something odd. The birds had stopped singing. Complete silence. Not even the rustle of leaves in the breeze.\n\nThat's when I saw it—a small clearing off to my right that I'd never noticed before. The grass was dead in a perfect circle, about fifteen feet in diameter. At the center was what looked like a crude stone well, maybe three feet tall.\n\nI approached it cautiously. The stonework looked ancient, covered in a type of moss I'd never seen before—dark purple, almost black. But the strangest thing? The air around it seemed... wrong. Like it was thicker somehow. Each step toward it felt like wading through invisible molasses.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I peered down into the well. It was too dark to see the bottom, but I could make out something reflective about ten feet down. I took out my phone to use as a flashlight, and that's when I heard it—a soft whisper that seemed to come from directly behind me.\n\n\"*Finally...*\"\n\nI spun around, but there was nobody there. Just the silent forest. My heart was hammering in my chest, but curiosity got the better of me. I turned back to the well and shined my light down.\n\nWhat I saw still haunts me. It wasn't water reflecting my light—it was eyes. Dozens of them, blinking independently of each other. Then they all focused on me at once, and the whisper came again, this time from the well:\n\n\"*We've been waiting for you.*\"\n\nI dropped my phone in shock. It clattered down the well, illuminating something pale and spindly starting to climb up toward me. I ran. I ran faster than I've ever run in my life, not stopping until I burst out of the treeline into my backyard.\n\nThat night, my phone rang. My phone that should have been at the bottom of that well. The caller ID showed my own number. I didn't answer.\n\nThe calls have continued every night since then, always at 3:17 AM. Last night, I finally worked up the courage to answer. There was only breathing on the other end, wet and ragged, before a voice—my voice—whispered:\n\n\"*We're coming up now. We found the way to your home.*\"\n\nI looked out my bedroom window toward the woods and saw lights moving between the trees, approaching slowly. They weren't flashlights. They were too small, too numerous, and they blinked.\n\nThis morning, I found wet, moss-covered footprints on my back porch. Purple-black moss, exactly like what was on the well. And there was a message written in the condensation on my kitchen window, visible only from the inside:\n\n\"*Thank you for the invitation.*\"\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't leave—I tried. My car won't start, and whenever I try to walk down the driveway, I get disoriented and somehow end up back at the house. Cell service is gone, and my internet cuts out whenever I try to look up information about the well or send messages about my situation.\n\nThis is my last attempt to reach out. I'm using my neighbor's unsecured WiFi, which somehow still works. If anyone knows what's happening or how to stop it, please help. I can hear something scratching at the basement door now.\n\nWait. I just realized something. The footprints this morning... they were heading *out* of the house, not in.\n\nOh god. I think they're already inside me.\n\nIf you're ever hiking in the woods of northern Maine and find a strange well, run. Don't look inside. Don't listen to the whispers. \n\nAnd if you get a call from your own number at 3:17 AM, whatever you do, don't answer.\n\nUPDATE: The scratching has stopped. Instead, there's a tapping on my bedroom door. Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap-tap. It's been going on for twenty minutes now. I'm going to try to make it to the kitchen for a knife. If I don't update again, tell my family I love them. Though I'm starting to forget what they look like.\n\nUPDATE 2: I looked in the mirror. My eyes are wrong. They're blinking out of sync with each other."},"16":{"title":"The Fall of Yorut","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh3cbq\/the_fall_of_yorut\/","flair":null,"author":"Gold_Firefighter_448","selftext":"When I was a kid, my mother told me stories every night. As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called \"Fork Flyers\", and larger ones known as the \"Sledgestones\", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.\n\n\nTuesday, February 9th, 1994 \n\n\nIt started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. \n\n\n\"Uh, hey man are you okay?\" I asked\n\n\"Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile.\" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. \n\n\"Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink\" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. \n\n\"It's on the house!\" Henry shouted, before adding \"IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE\" \n\n\nHenry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read \"Zero money down? Zero money EVER!\" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. \n\n\nAfter the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy \"kuh\". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. \"Flying Forks\" I thought \"no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'.\" \n\n\nCreatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. \n\n\nDiving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. \n\n\nI could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. \n\n\nI was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. \n\n\nA streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. \n\n\nTuesday February 10th\n\n\nI had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for \"stranger danger\" I had ever seen. \n\n\nWednesday, February 11th\n\n\nI made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say \"TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!\" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. \n\n\nI arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.\n\n\n\"Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing.\" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. \n\n\"Will you come with me?\" I asked timidly, \"I can't find the words.\" \n\nTerrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. \"Fine,\" He said \"but we need to be back before noon.\" \n\n\nWe stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their \"fingers\" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. \n\n\n \"What the fuck?\" \n\n\"...Yeah...\" was all I could offer. \n\n\"Why didn't you say anything when you found it?\" Terrence asked. \n\n\"Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this.\" I replied. \n\n\"That's...fair...\" he said. \"What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?\" \n\n\nI was relieved beyond measure to hear that. \"We.\" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. \n\n\nWe were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. \n\n\"Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now.\" \n\n\nThe small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. \n\n\nWe reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. \n\n\"My mother used to tell me about these things.\" I said. \"In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure.\" I continued, \"the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands.\" \n\n\"Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?\" Terrence Howard posited. \n\nI had been thinking much the same. I was ready to look up information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. \n\n\"I keep a book of old tales in my truck.\" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, \"I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes.\" \n\n\nI laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. \n\n\n\"Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help\" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. \n\n\nThursday, February 12th \n\n\nI filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said \"don't get your hopes up\". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. \n\n\nThe air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. \n\n\n\"What, no more free coffee?\" I asked, unserious. \n\n\"PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today.\" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. \"The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me.\" \n\n\"Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that.\" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. \n\nJohn's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: \"I like money too, yknow!\" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. \n\n\"How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-\" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. \n\n\nThe book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. \n\n\nBereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. \n\n\nShards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. \n\n\nIt seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. \n\nSo of course, shit hit the fan the next day. \n\n\nFriday, February 13th \n\n\nBedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. \n\n\n\"MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE\" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. \n\n\"TERRENCE\" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. \"I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?\"\n\n\n\"Huh?\" Was his initial reply, hastily adding \"Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley.\" \n\n\n\"Dude, I know!\" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. \n\n\nAs we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. \n\n\n\"Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again\" he said. \n\n\n\"I don't see much point in that.\" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. \n\n\n\"Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there.\" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. \n\n\n\"The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?\" I was worried about my friend\/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. \n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-\" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. \n\n\nEverywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over \"the good cart\" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying \"too late\" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. \n\n\nThe formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others did not follow Jonah on his subterranean journey. Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, their skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands upon thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.\n\n\nThat was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave."},"17":{"title":"The Sky Cracked Open pt2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgx91e\/the_sky_cracked_open_pt2\/","flair":null,"author":"FibonaccisUnconstant","selftext":"Link to pt1 https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/iT9sJbQMnU\n\n\nI haven’t left the property since that night.\n\nFood delivery drops at the end of the gravel road. I wait until the driver’s gone, then I collect the bags with gloves on. Cameras cover every inch of my land—thermal, night vision, motion-triggered. Not that they help much. The things that come don’t trip sensors. They just arrive.\n\nThree nights ago, the countdown ended.\n\nIt wasn’t dramatic. No sirens, no booming voice from the sky. Just… silence again. That same dead quiet from before. My clocks all froze at 2:13 AM. Every screen in the house went black—phones, laptop, even my digital watch. I could feel it in my bones—something had shifted.\n\nThen came the scratching.\n\nIt started in the attic. A slow scrape, like claws dragging along the inside of the beams. Not frantic, not random. Purposeful. I grabbed the shotgun from the hall closet, even though I knew it wouldn’t matter. You don’t kill shadows with buckshot.\n\nI crept up the attic ladder. The scratching stopped. The air felt thick, like breathing through syrup. My flashlight flickered. I whispered, “I’m not ready,” just to see if the voice would answer again.\n\nIt did.\n\nBut it wasn’t in my head this time.\n\nFrom behind the insulation came a voice—clear, almost human, but echoing like it was spoken down a long, wet tunnel:\n“Now you are.”\n\nThe insulation bulged. I fired without thinking. The blast blew out a cloud of fiberglass and something else—thick, clear slime that hissed when it hit the floorboards. My eyes burned from it. I fell back down the ladder, coughing and blind.\n\nWhen I could see again, there were prints on the wall. Not footprints. Handprints. Long-fingered, webbed, almost reptilian. They led across the ceiling, down the wall, and out the back door. I hadn’t even heard it open.\n\nThat’s when I knew the game had changed.\n\nThey weren’t just watching anymore. They were inside.\n\nI tried to call someone. No signal. I tried to leave. My truck wouldn’t start. The engine was fine—it just wouldn’t engage. Like something was jamming it at the molecular level. When I popped the hood, the battery was gone. Not stolen. Gone. No signs of removal—just smooth plastic where the connections should’ve been. Like it never existed.\n\nSo I waited.\n\nLast night, they came back. Not one this time. Three.\n\nI didn’t see them arrive. One second the yard was empty, the next they were just there. Standing perfectly still, facing the house. Seven feet tall. Bent like praying mantises. Skin like black velvet stretched over exposed bone. No eyes. No mouth. But I could hear them thinking.\n\nAnd they were thinking about me.\n\nI stepped out onto the porch, shotgun useless in my hands. I didn’t know what they wanted. I just knew hiding was done.\n\nThe tallest one moved first. It floated—not hovered—just… disconnected from gravity. It stopped ten feet from me. And then it spoke.\n\nNot in words. Not even in thoughts. It just opened itself, and I understood.\n\n“You held the key. You tuned the frequency. You brought the beacon.”\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I remembered.\n\nThe cube.\n\nThat wasn’t a memory I had before. But it unfolded in my mind like I’d always known. Years ago, as a kid, I found something in the woods. A small box, humming faintly, half-buried near a dead deer with no eyes. I kept it in a drawer for years until it vanished one night.\n\nI didn’t bring the beacon that night a few weeks ago. I activated it.\n\nThey’ve been coming ever since.\n\nThe being reached toward me. Not threatening—just expectant. Like it was time to finish something.\n\nI don’t remember reaching back. I just remember contact.\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe sky opened.\n\nBut this time, it wasn’t a crack. It was a hole. Circular. Precise. A perfect absence in the sky, revealing stars I’d never seen before, constellations that moved.\n\nFrom it came a sound. Not a scream. Not a roar. A chord. Music in a frequency you don’t hear—you feel. My teeth rattled. My bones ached. And my mind… it expanded.\n\nFor one second, I saw everything. All of it. The cities burning. The oceans empty. The towers rising. The great migration between galaxies. The farmed planets. The marked species. And us—just starting to bloom. Not unique. Not special. Just another trial run.\n\nI screamed. I think.\n\nAnd then I was back on the porch. Alone.\n\nNo beings. No hole in the sky. No light. Just the ache behind my eyes and a feeling that something big had taken notice.\n\nTonight, I hear the humming again. But not from outside.\n\nIt’s coming from under the house.\n\nI don’t know if they’re coming to finish something… or start something new.\n\nBut I know one thing:\n\nThis time, we’re not being visited.\n\nWe’re being claimed.\n\n"},"18":{"title":"I'm an urban explorer. I visited some village ruins on the outskirts of town. And something found me there...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh1e8a\/im_an_urban_explorer_i_visited_some_village_ruins\/","flair":null,"author":"storyscript","selftext":"We don’t know how long she’s been here. Even some of the oldest people in our town admit she was already a legend when they were kids.\n\n \n\nAfter recent events, I need to write this down to make sense of everything. Lest I go insane.\n\n \n\nFrom my mother's story, she used to be a normal Mobian. Her name is debated. Some say it was Swirl, others say it was Twist, and a ton others. She was a lemur, one that lived in Spiral Village herself. She was a cheery girl at the time, said to light up the town with her boundless energy.\n\n \n\nShe lived alongside her love, a wolf whose name was said to be spoken in only whispers. They were said to be inseparable, constantly at each other's side. Some say it was a love so innocent and pure that it would make you feel lighter just being around them.\n\n \n\nHowever, one day, she found a note from her love, simply stating she had gone out to finish a fight she had long since started. She looked all day for the wolf, asking around to anyone she knew. Eventually, she found her.\n\n \n\nDead.\n\n \n\nAccounts vary on what happened; some say that the wolf was stabbed to death, others that she had been shot, and others say that the lemur killed her herself. Though the stabbing story seems to be the original from my research. On that day, people could hear the lemur's broken cries for miles, as her heart bled out alongside the wolf.\n\n \n\nShe disappeared after that, gone for months, with no one knowing where she might have gone. The wolf was also reported missing, with no one knowing of her death at the time. But then, the wolf came back, seemingly fine, smiling even, though she seemed to get agitated whenever they asked about the lemur.\n\n \n\nNo word was heard from the lemur, with the wolf seeming far too happy despite her love being gone. Some wondered what had happened, with rumors beginning. At that time, the lemur came back, seemingly fine. She greeted everyone with a smile.\n\n \n\nBut something was wrong.\n\n \n\nHer smile, once so bright, now looked hollow, like a pathetic copy of what once was. Her movements were odd, limbs moving ever so slightly unnatural. Despite this, those who didn’t know her personally were happy that she had returned.\n\n \n\nBut those who did could tell something was amiss.\n\n \n\nSoon, everyone could see the problems between the wolf and the lemur. Their fights were constant, though they stayed together. Despite the attempts from others, they kept fighting.\n\n \n\nDuring this time, the massacres started. Those who dared commit crimes too horrid to speak of were found brutally murdered. First, it was small injuries, lacerations, and bruises. But it soon escalated until entire buildings were covered in flesh, with the monsters in them being brutalized beyond recognition, as if a demon had come from the depths of hell to punish them.\n\n \n\nBut one day, it reason behind all of it was revealed.\n\n \n\nThe lemur and wolf had been sent to find a criminal, one whose name has been forgotten. When they got there with their friend, they began the battle with them. During the fight, they had managed to cut the wolf’s face, slicing through her skin. In that moment, the lemur froze, her body fading in and out of existence as the wolf panicked. She cried, repeating ‘no’ over and over. When the lemur faded, the wolf turned…\n\n \n\nShowing the lemur’s face behind the wolf’s skin.\n\n \n\nThe rest of the story depends on the teller; some say she was saved, others say she was a demon that returned to hell. But overall, she was still a legend.\n\n \n\nA legend I have seen with my own eyes.\n\n \n\nI'm an urban explorer, but beyond the ruins of Spiral City were the ruins of Spiral Hill Village. It had long since been abandoned, some say because of the lemur. I decided to explore, having never been there myself. I took a small amount of food and water, alongside some tools to get around, namely a crowbar, a camera, a rope, and a torch.\n\n \n\nThe drive wasn’t long, only taking around an hour to get there. As the village got closer, something I noticed was that the sky seemed to close up as I got closer. The clouds got darker, the wind colder, even the plants seemed to slowly get more and more wild, stretching and growing beyond what would be seen anywhere in the city limits. The whole place had a sense of abandonment, but more importantly, the feeling of utter sadness. A feeling that this had once been something great, not reduced to nothing but a forgotten memory.\n\n \n\nAs I got out of my car, the sun wasn’t visible through the clouds, but there was enough light to not need to waste my torch battery. I walked through the abandoned town, looking through the collapsing buildings. There were multiple things that I found: photos, art pieces, and even some jewelry. However, I didn’t take anything, deciding to leave the ruins and the homes of these families as is.\n\n \n\nBut as I walked, something felt… wrong. I don’t know how to describe it. It felt like there were eyes everywhere, like I had just entered somewhere that didn’t want me. Like I had walked into some dark realm where I should have never entered. I didn’t think much of it at the time. The weather and the overall state of the city made everything feel off, and I’m not ashamed to say that I’m not exactly the bravest, so the feeling wasn’t something that came off as unnatural. So I foolishly walked in. \n\n \n\nHowever, two buildings seemed oddly… fine.\n\n \n\nThey had cracks and chips, but overall, you’d never know these were over a hundred years old. The first was a museum, or at least I think it was, if the glass display panels and panels with some jewels everywhere were any indication. I looked through the main office, finding a drawer with some old documents. It had belonged to someone named Jewel the Beetle. I knew her; she and her family had formed the Jewel Museum in the city, where memorabilia and trinkets from past heroes like Sonic and Tails were kept. Nothing had ever been said of her living here before, but considering how long it had been since she had been around, it made sense.\n\n \n\nAfter placing the documents back and taking some pictures with my camera, I walked out and found another building. This one was a house, a big one. Entering it, the inside was light stepping back in time. The place looked untouched and completely clean. The carpets were pristine, the walls painted, and the air fresh. It threw me for a loop, making me have to recompose myself for a second. Once I did, I explored the home, finding multiple photos.\n\n \n\nThey showed a wolf and a lemur. The lemur had her arm around the wolf, both of them smiling. They looked so happy, the lemur’s smile so bright that I couldn’t help but mimic it. Underneath the photo, a message was written.\n\n \n\n**‘Tangle and Whisper’**\n\n \n\n Multiple other photos were around the house. Some showed them at a beach, one with them sitting beside a sheep, and another with them in what looked like a town center, and many more. Each one looked so happy and cheerful, a contradiction to the state of the town.\n\n \n\nAs I looked, and brought out a cloth and cleaned some of the photos, as dust had piled up on some. As I did, the feeling of being watched eased a bit, though I didn’t know why. I kept looking, I came upon a door leading to what I assumed was a basement. Going down, I found the door unlocked and walked inside.\n\n \n\nI wish I hadn’t.\n\n \n\nInside, the basement was hot. Unnaturally hot. It was dark enough that I turned on my torch. The light shone on what looked like a massive map. Hundreds of photos and strings were strewn over it. Each photo showed a purple octopus with black eyes and white pupils. Journals and books lay around me, their writing so messy and chaotic that I couldn’t even begin to understand them. But I couldn’t focus on that as something caught my attention. That was a buzzing sound.\n\n \n\nLooking back, one of the support pillars for the basement was…glitching. I know it sounds strange, but it was glitching, its form flickering in blue. It kept doing so before it finally disappeared.\n\n \n\nAnd a pillar of flesh is what I was met with.\n\n \n\nIt reached the ceiling, stretching across it like a mold. Eyes bulged from it, all of them purple and watching him. And soon, everything around me began to glitch, as more and more flesh formed around me. I fell to the ground as more and more eyes appeared, all of them staring at me. But that wasn’t the part that truly scared me.\n\n \n\nIt was when I heard footsteps from up above.\n\n \n\nI had come here alone. I knew that. And while it could have been another explorer, I knew it wasn’t. Call it an instinct, but my gut knew that whatever walked up above was no Mobian. \n\n \n\nThe footsteps continued before they got close to the basement door. I ducked behind some of the furniture that hadn’t disappeared. And not a moment too soon, as the door creaked open, the footsteps came down the stairs. What followed were ragged breaths, ones that sounded like the owner's lungs were barely holding on. I stayed quiet, hoping whatever had entered wouldn’t see me. But as a violet light shone right at the furniture I was hiding behind and eyes formed next to me, watching me, I knew that wouldn’t be the case.\n\n \n\nThe breathing got closer, the footsteps getting louder. I was barely keeping it together as I pulled out the one thing I had brought just in case. A bottle of pepper spray. I wasn’t much, and I had wished I had brought something more powerful, but I would work…hopefully.\n\n \n\nRight when I could hear the entity right behind me, and turned and sprayed them, and a horrific and high-pitched scream rang out. I got up from my hiding place and ran to the door, only turning back once to see what had entered.\n\n \n\nAnd I felt my heart stop.\n\n \n\nThe entity had the body of a Mobian. But multiple appendages were sticking out of its body. Claws, arms, and what looked like cameras, all sprouting from their back. But that wasn’t the worst part.\n\n \n\nIt was the fact that I knew the being in front of me.\n\n \n\nIt was the lemur I had seen in the photos. Her white and blue fur was easily recognizable.\n\n \n\nTangle.\n\n \n\nAlongside the rotting skin of the wolf, of Whisper, I had seen in the photos with her.\n\n \n\nThe skin was practically falling apart from her body, with some parts seemingly stitched onto the lemur. Entire parts were missing, showing the flesh beneath the skin. But I could see blood from what looked like scratches and knife marks on the lemur’s real skin. Alongside that, I saw a strange three-pronged symbol in her right eye, now red from the pepper spray.\n\n \n\nIt took me a moment to break out of the shock, but I ran up the stairs and out of the house when I did. No sooner did I leave the house than the entire village began to glitch as I heard what sounded like a guttural scream and wolf howl echoing from behind me.\n\n \n\nAs it rang out, the buildings shifted as their walls were covered in flesh, eyes watching my every move, finally understanding why I had that watched feeling. Similar appendages to the ones that the lemur had formed from the masses, claws stretching out to grab me. Alongside it, camera-like appendages formed as well. They had the rough shape of a security camera, but instead of a lens, cloudy white eyes were stuck to them. Blood and mucus spilled under them as a purple glow came from them, following my every move.\n\n \n\nThings only got worse as I heard the sound of something running next to me. Looking up, I saw the lemur running along the rooftops, her eyes glaring at me as she chased me down. As I ran, I made it to the tree line as I ran through it. I could hear branches cracking as it still gave chase. I couldn’t see her well, but I could hear her swinging along the branches, launching herself from tree to tree. I had almost reached my car before something grabbed my leg and yanked me to the ground.\n\n \n\nMy forehead slammed against the ground hard, the sound of my camera going off hitting my ears. As I got up, I could feel blood slowly drip down and over my eyes. But I couldn’t focus on that as the sound of growling hit my ears. Spinning around, I saw a tendril had wrapped around my leg, having sprouted from the lemur’s back. She was glaring at me, crawling closer on all fours. Like a wolf stalking its prey.\n\n \n\nAs she got closer, some of those camera appendages formed, before they started nudging her. She looked at them for a second as small tentacles extended from them and connected to her next. Her eyes glowed as she went quiet. Behind her, I saw…myself. \n\n \n\nI saw myself going through the town, from what I could only was the point of view of the eyes. They showed me looking through the buildings, being careful the entire time, putting the files from the museum back into the drawer, and cleaning the pictures back at the home.\n\n \n\nIt went on like that for a few seconds before the lemur finally moved again, looking back at me. Her face, once filled with rage, now showed confusion, and then understanding. She studied me for a second before her eyes widened, a quiet whine coming from her. One of the cameras formed as a purple light washed over me. It stayed for a second before it disappeared. Once it did, the lemur hand twitched before a strange symbol, one that matched the one in her eye, but was glowing purple, formed in her hand.\n\n \n\nInstantly, I felt the pain around my body fade, as the small cuts I had gotten from the fall vanished alongside the blood. Once it was all healed, the tendril released my leg as the lemur got up and began to leave. She immediately climbed up the tree, giving me one more apologetic look before disappearing.\n\n \n\nAfter that, I picked up my camera and left.\n\n \n\nI…I know what I saw was the being from the city’s old legend. The Purple Demon, the Skinwalker, the Solver. The same one they had used as a simple ghost story. Was the one I had encountered.\n\n \n\nI haven’t told anyone close to me. God knows what they would think of it. But that wasn’t the only reason. The only reason I had been let go, from what I could tell, was because I hadn’t disturbed anything in the town, and had even helped clean some of the objects. If I revealed its existence, no doubt more would go looking for it, and I do not doubt that some of them would damage, if not destroy, the ruins to try and find the Solver.

They sprang to life all at once around my home, revealing a hidden kaleidoscope of color. I bore witness to shades and hues I can’t explain, as if I weren’t meant to see them at all, and the colors I could recognize were so vibrant it strained my eyes looking at them. Blues, reds, yellows, pinks, and any other color you could possibly think of danced like the sea inside a vibrant green backdrop. They swayed softly in the wind, in rhythm with the trees looming over them against the blue horizon. It was beautiful, mesmerizing. I found myself lost tracing petal patterns and watching blades of grass wrap themselves around the veiny stems coming from the soil. \n\nI then looked away and realized I had let them in. \n\nLooking at my watch told me that thirty-five minutes had passed in what seemed like seconds. My hands started perspiring as I stared at the open door in front of me. I slowly turned and looked toward the hallway to see dirt trailing to my son’s bedroom. My heart sank but I followed wearily, listening to what sounded like a loud cicada echoing off of the hallway walls. I stopped before reaching for the handle and closed my eyes, my body tensed as thoughts raced through my mind. My hand found the cold metal and I slowly pushed open the door. I strained to open my eyes back up, and as soon as they finally gave me sight again, my perspective on reality shattered.\n\nThere he was, wrapped in a web-like substance hanging from the ceiling. He was nearly a pile of bones at this point; I could see him through the semi-translucent silk. He was being consumed by, well, how do I even explain it? Arachnid-like in ways, centipede-like in others. Its multiple legs wrapped tightly around the webbed body of my son, alongside tentacles crushing whatever was left into a substance that its proboscis sucked down. It writhed and pulsed, its shell clattering as it swelled up. The large stinger remained in the cocoon, acting like a drain plug to keep its meal in place. The creature dwarfed him. He stood no chance; my wife before him stood no chance; and I stand no chance.\n\nEvery spring, they hatch. Their eggs sit beneath the earth and sprout like flowers when they’re nearing maturity, and then they hunt. They bring whatever is left of their victim into a burrow where they lay eggs inside of the cocoon, and they continue to multiply. Whatever toxin their flowers release puts people into a trance and most of the time, causes them to open windows or doors and let them into their homes. They seem to target the young or the elderly, but they've been different, more aggressive. We don’t know what they are, what purpose they serve, or if they’ll ever leave, but I know I’m not making it through it this time and I’m taking everything I can with me. \n\nGasoline and a match, that’s all I need."},"20":{"title":"My Grade School Campus is Haunted.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh1bdj\/my_grade_school_campus_is_haunted\/","flair":null,"author":"SnooCakes8721","selftext":"It’s been nearly a decade since I last stepped foot on the grounds of my old grade school, but the memories—unlike the buildings—refuse to decay.\n\nI was a student at a charter school that spanned pre-K through eighth grade, packed tight with kids and noise and energy. The campus itself was split into two main sections: the upper building, which housed the youngest grades and the administrative offices, and the lower building, home to the gym and middle school classrooms. It also used to be home to an old factory of some kind--I am still not sure what for, but the remnants sit alongside the trails that run behind the school. Between the upper & lower buildings sat the playground.\n\nAnd the dormitories.\n\nBefore our school existed, the land had belonged to a boarding school (and at some point like I mentioned, some strange factory). Two dormitories remained from that era—one for girls, one for boys—both long abandoned, their doors chained shut, their windows opaque with dust. Their very presence was a kind of haunting.\n\nWe weren’t supposed to go near them. Of course, we did.\n\nIt must’ve been fourth grade when a few of us—three or four at most—decided to sneak up the steps of the girls’ dormitory during recess. The building loomed, quiet and heavy, its rusted railings and peeling paint offering a kind of forbidden allure. From the top, we had a perfect view of the playground. We knew it wasn’t safe, but the risk was half the fun.\n\nWe leaned against the railing, laughing, when I happened to glance up at the second-story windows.\n\nThat’s when I saw her.\n\nA girl stood behind the glass, face pressed to it. Her hair was dark, tied with what looked like a pink or red ribbon. Her expression wasn’t blank—it was sorrowful. Restless. The longer I stared, the clearer she became. Her pale skin, the bruises on her arms, the way she raised one hand slowly to the pane as if to wave—or warn.\n\nI tried to speak. Tried to get someone’s attention. But before I could make a sound, a teacher’s whistle cut through the air, sharp and shrill. We were caught. Ushered down the stairs and scolded for being somewhere we shouldn’t have been.\n\nAs we walked away, I looked back. The window was empty. Just dust and glass and nothing at all.\n\nThey tore the building down that summer. Now there’s nothing left—not even a scar in the grass to suggest it was ever there. I wonder if that girl, or whatever I had seen, wishes to still be remembered. Or perhaps they were set free upon the destruction of the building.\n\nBut the boys’ dormitory remained. And what happened there—I’ve never spoken of until now.\n\nIt was eighth grade. I’d joined the cross-country team that fall, but a sprained ankle kept me from running in our final home meet. Instead, I was posted at a checkpoint to cheer my teammates on. One friend, exhausted, stopped beside me, needing to catch her breath. I offered to walk a stretch with her. We crossed the parking lot beside the boys’ dormitory. After a bit of back and forth chatting, my friend had decided that she should probably pick up the pace and finish the rest of the run. We exchanged goodbyes and I told her I'd be up there soon. She disappeared in a matter of moments up the path.\n\nThat’s when the feeling hit me.\n\nIt was like my gut turned to ice. Something unseen, but heavy. Watching.\n\nI stood there, staring at the dormitory’s warped frame. The paint was a sickly, chipped off-white, the windows cracked, the front door rusted and locked up in a similar fashion as the girls dormitory had been. I wanted to move, to leave, but I couldn’t. My feet stayed planted. My chest tightened.\n\nThen came the sound.\n\nA metallic clanging—sharp and rhythmic. Like iron against cement.\n\nBang. Bang. Bang.\n\nEach strike grew louder, closer. My breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away.\n\nThen came the cries.\n\nA boy’s voice, high and panicked. Then another. Screaming. Pleading, it seemed. But I couldn't quite make out the words. The banging changed—deeper, softer. A wet sound.\n\nAnd then the smell hit.\n\nRot. Thick, fetid decay. Like something dead had been left in the sun for days. It was all around me. In my hair, my nose, my mouth. I gagged.\n\nI still felt frozen as footsteps echoed—fast, pounding toward me from behind. I wanted to run. Every bone, every nerve, every muscle said *run.*  I was expecting something—someone—to come grabbing me from behind.\n\nBut nothing came.\n\nJust silence.\n\nAnd then, I could move again.\n\nI didn’t hesitate. I turned and limped away as fast as I could, ankle screaming in protest. I reached the edge of the road, just beyond the dormitory, collapsed into the grass, and vomited. The nausea clung to me, the stench still in my nose as I practically dragged myself back to the front entrance of the lower building and cleaned up before anyone could see me like that.\n\nThat was my final year at the school.\n\nI graduated later and never looked back.\n\nTo this day, I don’t know what happened in those dormitories. I don’t know who the girl in the window was, or whose voice cried out behind those crumbling walls. I only know what I saw. What I smelled. What I felt. I do know that as of today, that boys dormitory still sits. Rotting. Perhaps infesting others with what I experienced, too. I could only hope differently.\n\nAnd I know I’ll never go back.\n\nSome buildings remember.\n\nAnd sometimes, they want you to remember, too."},"21":{"title":"I just learnt that my ‘parents’ kidnapped me to save humanity, and they might have failed.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg9fwe\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me_to\/","flair":null,"author":"Theeaglestrikes","selftext":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka1ig2\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me_when_i\/) – [Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kcchyv\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me\/) – **Part III (FINAL)**\n\nIt’s baffling to me that the world keeps turning, oblivious to the hellish week I have just endured.\n\nOblivious to the fact that we all scarcely survived the end of the world.\n\nOblivious to the fact that it may still end.\n\nFollowing the events at the foot of that Parisian apartment, the bloody fragments of Blueman and the shattered cultists inexplicably turned to ash and were brushed upwards by the breeze. That dusty tempest beat against my skin, sticking those specks of people tightly to my fearful, paralysed body—a reminder of what I’d done. A reminder of the evil coursing through my veins.\n\nSomething haunting that possessed me.\n\nI knew that I should keep moving. Should burn through my meagre funds, travelling as far as I could in any direction, so as to not be found again—so as to become someone other than Charlie. Someone other than Adam: the harbinger of the apocalypse for whom the Old Collective was searching.\n\nBut I didn’t have the stomach to truly leave it all behind.\n\nI wanted to go home.\n\nI felt alone and exposed. Felt stalked, as ever, by eyes only human on the surface.\n\nAt the age of twenty, having lived and studied as a university student for two years, I had long thought myself to be a grown-up. To be strong and independent. However, facing nightmares beyond myself had unveiled the truth—that I was, beneath it all, still a child.\n\nAnd though I tried, I couldn’t help myself. I reverted back to being a boy desperate for his mother and father.\n\nSo, I did exactly what the Old Collective expected of me. I took a flight home. And I was very nearly lulled into a false sense of security at Beauvais Airport—by the crowds of everyday people, nattering and chattering about trivial things; but triviality was a coddling blanket, as it tricked me back into my old self—the one who didn’t believe in forces higher than ourselves. The one who believed only in the very grounded and very real world we all see with our eyes.\n\nIt must’ve been a trauma response to the terrifying things I had seen and endured in Paris.\n\nBy the time I landed in Manchester, I was *blindly* eager to see my parents. All thought of danger had fled my mind. All I thought was that they must’ve been worried sick about me for the past few days. That they may well have been home from the hospital already—sitting at home, awaiting my return.\n\n*They didn’t call*, I reminded myself.\n\nThat might’ve been a cause for concern, had I been thinking clearly.\n\nBut when the nurses and doctors at the local hospital told me that no-one by the name of my father had been admitted within the past week, I felt a pang of fear. The mental alarm bells startled to toll quietly, clanging in a near-inaudible rhythm.\n\nStill, I tried my damnedest to ignore my mind, screaming at me to *RUN*, and decided, instead, to escalate the matter. I asked to talk to somebody about the ambulance service’s records, as a vehicle had very clearly been dispatched to my street—I’d heard the siren as I fled. They found a record of my mother’s 999 call. Found a member of staff who’d been dispatched to the street. But—\n\n“Nobody was there,” the paramedic explained. “We knocked on the door, then tried to access the property, and finally called the fire department to assist. But when we searched your house, we found neither your mother nor father. They may well face legal action for the false call, so—”\n\n“It wasn’t a false call,” I interrupted breathlessly. “They should’ve been there… They…”\n\n“Weren’t you with them?” asked the paramedic.\n\nI gulped, then lied. “I… went out to the shop when Mum called me.”\n\n“Then you waited two days to come to the hospital looking for your father?” the paramedic asked, eyes narrowing suspiciously.\n\nI shook my head then started backing away, not looking to find myself in any sort of trouble—for all I knew, eyes were watching me. The news of my parents’ disappearance had woken up something in me. Had reminded me of the very present danger encroaching from all sides, suffocating me.\n\n“I have to… find them,” I hoarsely croaked, turning on my heel and quickly striding away before the paramedic could probe any deeper into the odd turn of events.\n\nI left the building, eyes stinging with a starting set of teardrops; I was moments away from bursting into full-blown bawling. But then I was overcome by a sudden sense of purpose—a sudden idea, to be exact. The Old Collective had my parents, and I knew how to find them. But I would have to face one of my oldest fears.\n\nI took a long taxi ride to Cheshire, and was dropped off at Styal Prison. An ominous cluster of buildings, in the sense that they appeared more like haunted houses than the wards of a penitentiary. Red-bricked, two-storey buildings with stunted chimneys.\n\nOnly the sign gave away that I had stumbled not into a residential street but a prison:\n\n>***Welcome to HMP & YOI Styal***\n\n>Building Hope\n\n>Changing Lives\n\nAnd the inmate I had come to visit was, as I’m sure you’ve deduced, my old Religious Education teacher: Miss Black.\n\nThe woman who attempted to steal me from the world as a child.\n\n“Has she had many visitors over the past six years?” I asked.\n\n“No,” the officer bluntly replied.\n\nAnd that was the end of the conversation.\n\nThe prison officer led me down dimly-lit corridors in one of the smaller buildings. I looked out of the windows, but sunshine did nothing to cut through the gloom of the place.\n\nI had seen many friendly faces in the prison—inmates and officers alike. But this particular man was the first who seemed cold and distant. I had the strangest feeling that it had something to do with the woman he was taking me to visit.\n\n“Might I ask why we won’t be talking in the visitor’s centre?” I asked politely as the man stopped in front of a particular door, shaky fingers around the door handle.\n\n“We bend the rules for her,” he whispered, voice nearly cracking. “It’s better for everyone when she stays in here.”\n\nAs the prison officer unlocked the door, I turned a little pale and barked, “Wait!”\n\nHe sighed and turned to face me. “What?”\n\n“I…” I started, shivering. “I don’t know about this.”\n\nAnd the man simply nodded, as if fully understanding. “Do you want me to lock this door? I should. I should lock it, then you should go home and never come back here.”\n\nThe prison officer extended his free hand towards me, possibly to comfortingly pat me on the shoulder, but I retreated with wide, fearful eyes, remembering what had happened when Blueman’s skin met mine. I had a horrifying flashback of his body overflowing with piping hot blood, moments before his flesh burst completely.\n\nI didn’t want to risk touching another person again—didn’t want to risk even thinking of another person, as I’d somehow fated the cultists to the same ends by merely letting our minds connect.\n\nI realised I had no control of the thing hiding within me.\n\nOr, perhaps more terribly, that thing had all of the control.\n\nI keep thinking that, perhaps, Adam has always been the real child. As far as I know, *I* am the being hitching a ride in a demonic creature.\n\nAnyhow, the prison officer seemed startled by my fearful, retreating reflex, but he quickly returned his hand to his side.\n\n“Why?” I whispered, infected by the man’s contagious terror. “Why are you so afraid of her?”\n\nHe said, “Because bad things happen to people who so much as look at her. Things I don’t know how to explain. Deaths, maims, and other nightmares that she couldn’t have possibly have caused, but she is somehow always to blame—we all feel it, so we all stay away from her.\n\n“It’s happened time and time again to inmates and officers; they go back to their cells, or homes, then they suffer horrible fates. And it’ll happen to you too, kid. So, I’ll ask you one more time: do you want me to lock this door?”\n\nI shook my head, and the officer offered me a pitying look, then a head nod. He flung the door open and stepped back, shakily motioning for me to step inside. He mumbled something about me hollering for him if necessary, but there was a pleading tone to his voice.\n\n*I beg of you, kid, don’t holler for me; don’t make me go in there with her.*\n\nMiss Black sat on the bottom bunk of her two-person room which, through a series of horrifying supernatural events, she had snagged for herself. Undoubtedly, given the prison officer’s story, nobody would want to share a cell with such a haunting woman.\n\nThere was nothing comforting about seeing her with greying locks of hair, and tired eyes winged with crow’s feet. Age had not weakened her in my eyes. If anything, it only afforded greater depths of wisdom and nightmarish power. Made her somehow less human in my eyes.\n\n“Adam…?” Miss Black whispered, meeting my gaze with teary eyes and a jubilant smile. “You came back to me… To us… As foretold.”\n\nI shuddered in horror at those two final words. I had come there of my own free will—my own volition. I’d been certain of that. But Miss Black made me doubt everything. Instilled me with dread greater than even that of my fourteen-year-old self. I felt lesser than I had on that day, with my schoolmates calling for Mr Alton to save me—\n\nBecause I was alone this time.\n\n“Where are my parents?” I wheezed.\n\n“The defectors?” Miss Black asked. “I have heard stories of them. Heard stories of you. When you were born, we travelled from far and wide, from all corners of the Earth, to see you. But I was not blessed to—”\n\n“Please,” I begged. “They’re gone, and I need them.”\n\n“*They abandoned you?*” Miss Black hissed, brows suddenly lowering and gentle demeanour turning dark; it almost felt as if the sun had dimmed beyond her barred glass pane. “They defected from us. And they defected from you. They will pay when the crescent moon comes. When you rise to your fullest.”\n\nMy lips quivered. “Please… You have to know something. Where are they?”\n\nThe woman smiled. “I am but one of many. Look at me, rotting away in this cage. The Old Ones have not come to collect me, have they? I don’t know why you would imagine that I know a thing about your filthy abductors.”\n\n“*THEY’RE MY PARENTS!*” I screamed at the woman, fists clenching and eyes burning—with neither tears, nor rage, but something I didn’t understand.\n\nShe smiled widely, and I saw a glint of red in her eyes, but it didn’t come from her.\n\nIt was a reflection of my *own* scorching pupils.\n\nI unclenched my fists and stumbled backwards, moaning in abject fear at whatever I’d just experienced. Whatever I’d felt burgeoning within me, threatening to bubble to the surface. I felt the red flit away from my retinas, but it was still there, lurking behind them—lurking deep within me.\n\nAnd no matter how lovingly Miss Black looked at me, I knew that I wasn’t the chosen one at all.\n\nI was a vessel for something deeper and darker that had been hibernating within me for twenty years.\n\nSomething on the verge of coming out.\n\nOf replacing me.\n\n“You are so nearly ready,” she giggled tearfully.\n\nI gulped and turned. “I’m leaving now…”\n\n“*WAIT!*” she screeched, halting me in my tracks. “I’ll help you… I’m connected to the Old Collective. I’m sure they will know what happened to your… *mother and father*.”\n\nThose last three words were practically spat out of Miss Black’s mouth, as if they’d tasted sour and poisonous on her tongue. I knew she was fooling me somehow. Knew that, given her desperation for me to stay, I should leave even more hurriedly—should be doing whatever possible to not give her what she wanted.\n\nBut I needed Mum and Dad.\n\nI turned and nodded. “Please.”\n\nShe smiled. “As you will it, Adam. *Blessed be*.”\n\nWhen she opened her mouth, I expected words to come out. Some ritualistic chanting in a foreign language. Something that would summon her fellow cultists to the prison. Instead, however, her mouth kept opening. Wider and wider, in both height and width.\n\nAnd my own lips could only open so far as I screamed at the impossibility before me.\n\nScreamed as her lips widened to fill the whole room.\n\nWidened and barrelled towards me.\n\nI banged feverishly on the door, shrieking at the top of my lungs for the prison officer to let me out. But either he’d scarpered from the scene or Miss Black had already swept me away from that world.\n\nAnd then I fell into her blackened maw, shrieking until my vocal cords gave out.\n\nThen came blinding white from the black, and when I rubbed my eyes, my vision eventually adjusted to the blazing sun above. To the blue and yellow above—to the green below. I felt grass scratching my skin and sat up, immediately feeling a lurch in my gut. I recognised that place.\n\nIt was the field from the photograph in my parents’ attic.\n\n*I had returned home.*\n\nAnd not spiritually. Not in some vision that Miss Black had cast. She had, impossibly, flung my body from that cell in Styal Prison to a distant rural land. The land in which I had been born. The land to which pilgrims of the Old Collective had fled from across the world to see me. Their chosen one.\n\nTheir bringer of humanity’s end.\n\n“*CHARLIE!*” screamed a voice from behind me.\n\nI shot to my feet and spun to see a horrifying sight.\n\nSwaying upside down from the upper beam of a wooden structure, shaped like a football goalpost, were my parents, bound by their ankles. And behind them, in a group of twenty or thirty, stood members of the Old Collective.\n\n“He has returned to us!” cried a shrill voice from the crowd.\n\n“Yes. Sister Black shall be rewarded,” came a deeper voice.\n\n“*RUN, CHARLIE!*” my mum begged a second time.\n\nShe was silenced by a swift thump to the head with one man’s wooden stick.\n\n“Please!” I begged, staggering forwards through the grass. “Just let my parents go.”\n\n“Your parents?” came a woman’s voice from the crowd.\n\nAnd then they emerged. The blonde couple from the photo. Of course, twenty years later, their hair bore quite a few white strands, but they were unmistakeably the two who had been holding the baby in the picture.\n\nI felt sick.\n\n“Adam,” the man whispered. “We have spent two decades searching for you. Our boy. Blessed be.”\n\n“Blessed be,” his wife blubbered.\n\nThe two walked, hand in hand, towards me, and I cast my eyes to my true parents, swinging upside down from the wooden beam—not the ones who created me, but the ones who raised me. The ones who saved me from this nightmare.\n\n“Please…” I begged the blonde couple in fear, then I forced out the words, “Mum and Dad.”\n\nI let them embrace me, as terrified as I felt. Their skin didn’t crack, and blood didn’t spill loose, which only filled me with hellish questions.\n\nWhy wasn’t Blueman spared the same fate?\n\n*And what am I?*\n\n“Our son,” my biological father whispered into my fear as the pair squeezed me more tightly.\n\nI shivered, realising that our minds were connected. That he could read my every thought and desire.\n\nThat he knew I was lying.\n\nThat I didn’t see them as Mother and Father.\n\nThat I didn’t care about the Old Collective, and I’d burn it all down to save my real parents.\n\nWhat horrified me above all else was that they didn’t seem to care. Not a single member of that cult. This only made me fear that they, much like the nightmare dwelling within my body, held all of the cards—held the true power in the scenario.\n\nAnd that I, Charlie, would die as soon as the time had come. As soon as I had become—\n\n“*Ripe*,” my biological mother whispered tearfully in my other ear. “You are so nearly there, Adam.”\n\n“I’m Charlie…” I sniffled.\n\nAnd then their hands dug more deeply into my flesh.\n\nI tried to scream, but something held my tongue.\n\nThat thing within.\n\n“*YOU ARE ADAM*,” the blonde man hissed. “*CHARLIE IS A LIE THAT WILL DIE UNDER THE CRESCENT MOON*.”\n\n“Soon, my darling,” his wife whispered as the pair pulled away from me. “Blessed be.”\n\nThe man sighed, eyeing me softly again. “Blessed be.”\n\n“What do I have to do to free them?” I asked, watching my teary-eyed parents squirm in their restraints. “Who is in charge?”\n\nMy cult mother smiled. “The Crescent Moon.”\n\nTo add emphasis to this answer, my cult father thrust his finger towards my chest, and I looked down, feeling a jolt course across my skin and through my core. I felt it behind my ribcage. The irregularity. The *dum, ba-ba-dum, dum, ba-ba-dum*—like the beat of a drum, not a heart. We are not built to be conscious of own organs. Our own innards. But my biological father had made me, with the touch of his finger, so horribly, horribly aware of my inner cogs.\n\n*Of my crescent-shaped heart.*\n\nThere came chest pain, and I looked down to see something pressing through my chest—pressing through the fabric of my shirt.\n\nA half-moon outline.\n\nI fell to my knees in the grass, hyperventilating as I realised that the members of the Old Collective weren’t waiting for a crescent moon in the sky.\n\nThe Crescent Moon was me.\n\nThe heart within me.\n\nThe living thing waiting to awaken.\n\n*Waiting to ripen.*\n\n“Charlie is a lie,” the blonde man reiterated more softly. “You will come to understand that, Adam, when you, like the rest of us, bow to the Crescent Moon. But we must help you along, boy, for you have been led astray for too many years by these blasphemers.”\n\nMy biological father took a few purposeful strides towards my mother and father swaying in the air.\n\n“Go to hell,” my true dad growled.\n\nThe blonde man chuckled. “I’ll show you the afterlife of the one true religion, sinner.”\n\nMy biological mother offered me what almost appeared to be empathy. “We are sorry for this, Adam.”\n\nThen the cultist, in one swift motion, drew a blade from his belt and ran it across my father’s throat.\n\nMy mother and I screamed in unison as a river of red ran out of the wound, spilling over my father’s spluttering mouth.\n\nA moment later, the cultist ran that same blade through the flesh of my mother’s throat.\n\nI wailed in agony, watching my true parents wriggle in the restraints as the blood drained from their still-alive bodies. But it didn’t take long for my father to stop moving. And my mother, desperately trying to mouth some words to me with her dying lips, eventually hung still too.\n\n“And now,” my biological father announced, turning to face me. “It is time to drain you, Adam.”\n\nAs the man walked towards me, wielding that blood-stained blade, I felt fear grip every inch of my body. Fear beyond anything primal. Fear existential, as I questioned what would become of me after my throat had been slit and my body had been exsanguinated.\n\n*Would my body rise again as something else?*\n\nI clutched my temples and closed my eyes, trying to ignore the fear in my heart as the man’s feet squelched against the grass and my horrifying end approached.\n\nAnd then I saw them in my mind’s eye.\n\nThe faces of the cultists standing in that field, watching me from the execution site.\n\nWatching my father walk towards me.\n\nWithin my mind, I reached out and touched them all.\n\nIt was an act of self-defence, and rage, and sorrow. I kept my eyes closed as the screaming started, but I saw the horror behind closed eyes. Saw it through our accursed spiritual connection. The cracking skin fissures, letting blood run free, then the shattering of the bodies one by one.\n\nOnly my biological mother and father remained, lying in the grass, when I opened my eyes.\n\nI towered over them, resisting the urge to let that hate flare in my pupils—the redness that I’d seen reflected in Miss Black’s own eyes. But it was too late. As my blonde parents clung to their last moments of life, skin cracking and steaming blood spilling free, they both smiled at me.\n\n“Blessed be,” croaked my mother. “With this act, you have… prepared yourself for the harvest.”\n\nShe shattered, and my father didn’t even flinch—didn’t let their smile waver for a second.\n\n“Ripe,” he croaked as his very lips began to fragment, and his body began to fall apart. “*One more time, Adam*.”\n\nAnd then I was left standing again in an empty field, accompanied only by a gust of ash in the air and my true parents’ pale corpses hanging from a wooden beam.\n\nBut the true horror survived within my chest—that crescent-shaped abomination, with a life of its own, threatening to break free.\n\nThreatening, next time, to connect with every last person on Earth, turning them all to ash and leaving me as the last thing alive.\n\n*One more time, Adam.*\n\nI understand now. With every tap into that thing within me, I have made it stronger. Have brought it closer to fully taking the reins. Mum and Dad were shielding me from myself, hoping I would never unlock that part of me. That I would never become what the Old Collective had *made* me to be.\n\nI don’t know how they woke up.

Custom dominated sense, and culture preceded reason. One of those traditions was that the bride had to be fetched to the groom's village at midnight—always midnight. Folks said it was to guard her modesty, to make sure no stranger saw her face before she moved into her new home. But I always figured it was a matter of fear—superstition masquerading as ritual. No one challenged it. No one dared.\n\nThat night, as with so many nights before me, I was one of the men who were called to escort the bride. I was not her brother, but I was a cousin—close enough by blood to accept the honor and heavy enough with obligation to not refuse. Two of us walked behind the bullock cart, sticks in hand, keeping watch under the moon. The cart creaked like an old bone with every turn of the wheel. The bride was concealed inside, wrapped in silence, shrouded behind folds of cloth and tradition.\n\nThe village was hours away from here, and the road twisted through empty fields and dense, whispering forests. The air was chill but had a stillness that made even the insects reluctant. All that could be heard was the gentle crunch of our footsteps on the ground, the oxen's sigh, and occasionally the ghostly hoot of an owl in the distance.\n\nAs we strolled past a small pond—a dark sheet of still water under the stars—I saw something scurrying around its rim. I looked into the blackness. It had looked like a fox, a thin and small one, its nose twitching as it dug in the rubbish left by travelers. Maybe it was its wild movements that caught my eye. Maybe it was the way it stared at me when it saw me looking.\n\nHalf-jestingly, I said, \"Why look there when you can ride with us? We have plenty to fill you up for days in our village.\" I laughed softly to myself. My partner shot me a sidelong look but remained silent. At the time, I felt strangely proud of my joke, as though I had uttered something witty into the darkness.\n\nWe proceeded further.\n\nBut the night wasn't forgetful.\n\nTen minutes or so after that, I heard the faintest noise behind us—a shuffle or a dragging foot. I turned, and there it was. The fox. Only. it wasn't quite the same. It was bigger now, its fur wet or perhaps gone in patches. It trailed behind at a distance, keeping just far enough back to be just on the edge of sight in the dark.\n\nI laughed nervously and thumped my stick on the ground. \"Shoo! Go eat somewhere else,\" I said, trying to be bolder than I felt. The creature hesitated, tilted its head—but didn't flee.\n\nMy cousin turned around and saw it too. \"Foxes don't follow people like that,\" he complained.\n\nMaybe it's sick,\" I replied, \"I don't believe it.\".\n\nI kept looking over my shoulder more than I looked where I was going. The beast trailed behind, steady and slow, as if it were somehow held to us. Each time I glanced back at it, it looked less fox. Its gait was unnatural—too smooth, too silent. Its eyes had lost that animal glint and now simply reflected nothing. No fear. No curiosity. Nothing.\n\nThen came the moment that changed everything.\n\nI turned once again, and what I saw rooted me to the ground.\n\nIt was not a fox. It was not even a beast. It was on four legs, but its body was naked—smooth and long. Holes pockmarked its skin, as if decay had taken hold years ago, but it still had a purposeful movement. It was the length of a calf, contorted and curved in shape, but appallingly alive. It looked at me as if it had heard the joke I had told and had accepted the invitation.\n\nI remained there. My heart was beating so fast that I was afraid to wake the bride. My cousin bent forward and whispered, \"What… what is that?\" but I couldn't answer.\n\nI knew—in my very bones—that we could not bring it into the village.\n\nSo I did the best I could think to do. I approached it slowly on foot, shaking with every step. I placed my stick in front of me as a sign of surrender, then went down on my knees.\n\n\"Please,\" I whispered. \"I've done something wrong. There is nothing there for you where we're going. I've made a false statement. Don't follow us, please.\"\n\nThe creature didn't move. It stared at me, empty eyes unblinking. For a moment, I was convinced it was about to pounce. But then, with a slight shift of its odd head—or perhaps a readjustment of its odd body—it wheeled westward and left. No noise. No sign. Silent and away.\n\nIt disappeared into the darkness, consumed by the night.\n\nI just stood there for what seemed like forever before I could walk again. My cousin and I never said a word to one another as we walked. We did not even glance to see if the beast would return. We did not care.\n\nOne week later, word came from the west.\n\nVillage after village—sick. People dying in scores. Some said it was malaria. Others said it was a curse. I remembered the holes on that creature's skin, the way it walked, the silence it carried with it. I remembered what I had said, what I had invited.\n\n\"Was it me?\" I kept asking myself, over and over. \"Did I unleash something?\"\n\nThe shame clung to me like dust, heavy and smothering. I starved for days. I could not sleep without seeing its face—or what amounted to one. Each evening, I caught myself gazing out to the west, half-hoping to see its shape materialize on the horizon, coming back to claim the rest of what I had vowed.\n\nYears went by, but the sensation never faded. The bride and groom went on with their lives, and other people quickly forgot that evening. But I did not. I could not. Certain errors diminish with the passing of time, but some cast a shadow. I had laughed in the darkness, and something had listened. Something that did not laugh.\n\nAnd now, even years later, I find myself wondering. Was that thing the disease carrier? A ghost? A demon? Or was it something created by guilt, born from a coincidence so terrible it could not be overlooked? I don't know. All I know is this: some invitations are not meant to be spoken. And if they've done so, they cannot be taken back anymore."},"23":{"title":"Judgment Day","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg2bc4\/judgment_day\/","flair":null,"author":"Writerwithoutsoul","selftext":"I’m a defense attorney, but this story isn’t about my job. It’s about the day my client Christina completely butchered her carefully-drafted defense by stabbing me in the stomach.\n\nAs I desperately tried to keep my intestines inside, I wished good luck onto my predecessor. Getting Chris out of this one would be pretty damn hard. Even though, I thought, it wasn’t  *technically* sufficient evidence. Just cause Christina had stabbed me didn’t *necessarily* mean she had stabbed all those others as well.\n\nThen, my world got dark.\n\n \n\nThe next thing I remember is my feet feeling soft. Very soft. I was standing on a cloud. Weird. I stared at my hands. They were clean. No guts. The world was bright. And there were people in front of me. And behind me. I was in some kind of line. As it moved forward, I figured out three things: \n\n1. I was probably dead. \n\n2. I was in line to get into heaven. \n\n3. While everyone else was wearing some type of nightgown, I was still in my pantsuit.\n\nAs I got closer and closer to the pearly gates, more and more wrinkles appeared on the face of the angel guarding them. When the girl in front of me stepped up to him, he only took one single look at her, his expression full of disdain.\n\n“Hell.”\n\n“Wait”, the girl shook her head, “wait, wait, wait. I didn’t mean to kill them.”\n\nI frowned. Something about that voice seemed familiar.\n\n“I’m sorry”, she said, “I’m sorry. I just get so angry sometimes. But I… I wanted to be better. I swear. And I…”\n\nI took a step forward. “Christina?”\n\nThe angel looked up. The disdain on his face turned into annoyance. “Oh Lord, why are *you* here? Your time hasn’t come yet.”\n\nI clicked my tongue. “Well, that’s unfortunate. But if you’ll excuse us, I’d like to talk with my client for a moment?”\n\nHe grumbled something incomprehensible.\n\nChristina and I stepped aside. “What’s going on here?”, I asked, “this doesn’t add up. I died before you. Did you push past me in line or something?”, I tilted my head, “also, uhm, why did you stab me?”\n\nChristina didn’t look at me. “Sorry”, she whispered, “I couldn’t face you. Sometimes, I just see red”, she took a deep breath, “But now that’s okay. Now, the police shot me and I get what I deserve”, she raised her voice, preparing herself to step forward. “I’m ready.”\n\n“Wait”, I pushed her behind me, “wait, stop. She doesn’t deserve eternal damnation. Listen. One of the main ideas behind our justice system is rehabilitation. My client clearly regrets what she did, and she wants to do better. Don’t you have like a heaven-equivalent to prison? Community service? Purgatory?”\n\nThe angel blinked. “This is none of your business.”\n\n“It is, literally”, I crossed my arms, “this woman is my client.”\n\nThe angel closed his eyes. “Defense attorney, right. I really hate you guys.”\n\n“Doesn’t everyone deserve justice?”, I asked, “just as the Lord gives it to us?”\n\n“You try to be like the Lord?”\n\nI suddenly remembered that the angel was gonna judge *me* next. I forced myself to lower my gaze. “I just try to be kind. To be fair. To be a good person.”\n\nHe smiled at me. I suppressed a shudder. I hadn’t thought that it was possible for an angel to smile so sinisterly. It took all my strength not to jerk back.\n\n“Do you wish to take on a second job here?”, the angel asked, “your time hasn’t come. You will return back to earth soon. But if you want, you can visit us at night. You can do what you do best: Defend. What do you think?”\n\n“I… uhm”, I trailed off. Honestly, I didn’t really have the capacity to take on a night-job. Also, I was a lawyer. I  had a talent for smelling bullshit. And by the way the angel spoke… if I said yes, I wasn’t gonna get a salary. On the contrary, agreeing was gonna cost me. I didn’t know what. But it was gonna cost me.\n\nThe angel tilted his head. “Everyone deserves an attorney, right?”\n\nI swallowed. “Right.”\n\n“Good”, he made a little note in his book, “then go ahead. Defend her. But be aware, she isn’t going to hell for the murders. She has confessed and regretted those.”\n\n“For what then?”, I asked.\n\n“Adultery.”\n\nChristina waved. “We were only married on paper by then.”\n\n“Divorce.”\n\n “But I don’t regret that”, Christina said, “how could I? I was a danger for him. I loved him enough to let him go.”\n\n“You could have worked on it.”\n\n“I tried, I…”\n\n*“Hell.”*\n\n“Excuse me”, I said, “my client has acted in the best interests of her ex-husband. Her noble motives should be taken into consideration when…”, I stopped mid-sentence. A terrible feeling crept up inside of me. Suddenly, I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t do anything except writhe in agony as I saw the demons appeared.  So I just watched them drag Christina to hell.\n\n“Next”, the angel said.\n\n“Wait, you can’t…”, I stuttered, “Stop. Bring her back. I didn’t have time to… I couldn’t even defend her. You *have* to let me defend her.”\n\n“I said next!”\n\nThe next woman walked up, a lovely lady with a huge sunburn.\n\n“Did I die from gardening?”, she asked, “I’m sorry, that can’t be right. I know I sometimes forget to wear a hat, and my son *has* said it will be the end of me, but…”\n\n“Hell”, the angel interrupted, “lesbian.”\n\n“Objection!”, I yelled, “I… uh… she… I”, I felt my breath hitch and forced myself to swallow, “well. Your honor. First of all, this woman didn’t hurt a soul.”\n\nThe angel shrugged. “She is a woman who lay with another woman. Hell.”\n\n“So why *the fuck* did you make her that way?”, I took a deep breath. Swearing probably wasn’t the best strategy. “How could her love be something sinful when it resulted in a beautiful, god-fearing, loving family? When it resulted in charity, in children, in a garden she grew?”\n\n“She sinned, and she never regretted it. *Hell*.”\n\n“What?”, I stared at him “you can’t…”\n\nI froze. There was that feeling again. That terrible, helpless feeling. I cried softly as they dragged the woman down to eternal damnation. “Thank you for trying”, she whispered.\n\nI stared at the place where she disappeared. I had failed her. I had failed my clients. I clenched my fists. Focus. Be what the angel hired you for. A defense attorney. Professional. Argumentative. Good under pressure. I felt myself calm down. I had trained for this.\n\nA tug at my sleeve. A young girl, almost a child. “Can you help me?”, she asked, “I’m scared to talk to the angel because I made my baby go away. Do you think he will be mad at me?”\n\nTears were flooding down my cheek. I wondered if that meant rain on earth.\n\nI couldn’t stop the crying, but I could still use my voice. So, I cleared my throat, re-arranged my blazer. Made sure my hair was in order. And smiled.\n\n“Let’s find out, sweetie.”\n\n \n\n“You’re awake!”\n\nA happy voice. The first happy voice in a long, long time.\n\nI was still crying. But now, someone was stroking my face, wiping the tears away. I recognized the smell of my partner. I opened my eyes and then, she was crying too.\n\n“How long was I out?”, I asked.\n\n“About three days”, she forced herself to smile, “was it a relaxing coma? The first time in a while you got that much sleep, huh?”\n\n“It was terrible”, I said, “I had the weirdest nightmare.” Three days. Three days and hundreds of cases. I had lost all of them. Except… wait. I still had one real client. \n\n“What about Christina?”, I asked, “how is she doing?”\n\nMy wife bit her lip. “Honey, I uhm… I don’t know how… well… oh screw it. That bitch tried to stab you, so I’m just gonna say it. Christina is dead. The police shot her.”\n\nI closed my eyes. It didn't stop the images. Hundreds of faces. Hundreds of women I hadn’t saved. Christina had been real. They had all been real.\n\n“You know, her ex-husband picked up her remains”, my wife cleared her throat, “he said… he said he was sure Christina was sorry for stabbing you. She just got angry like that, sometimes.”\n\nThe beeping of monitors grew louder around me. Doctors and nurses rushed in. Everyone was freaking out, thinking I was gonna die… again. Like Christina. Christina was dead. Shot by police. Pretty damning evidence for once.\n\nI forced myself to open my eyes again, to look at the one face that wasn’t dead, though it was just as damned as the others. My wife. There were lines in that face, lines from age and laughter. I touched her cheek, and my heartbeat calmed down.\n\n“It’s okay love”, she said, “it’s okay. Christina is in a better place now.”\n\nI forced myself to smile. “Let’s go home soon, yeah?”\n\n \n\nIt actually took a few weeks until they released me. The experience gave me a huge scar on my stomach and a new job.\n\nNow, I’m a defense attorney at night as well. I have lines on my face now, too, lines of anger and pain. I wake up crying every morning. I try my best to prepare myself in the evenings. To be a professional, to guarantee a fair trial. But how can you win a fight when the laws weren't written for you? So far, I have lost 231118 cases. Divorces. Escaping abusive relationships. Adultery. Abortions. All while men who have done unspeakable things sneaked right past the gate, simply by claiming they regret it. I know that when my time comes, the demons will drag me down as well. I will suffer alongside all the people I have failed.\n\nBut every morning, right before I head out to work, I kiss my wife goodbye. And I cannot help it.\n\nI cannot regret loving her."},"24":{"title":"I Work At A State Park and None of Us Know What's Going On: Part 7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kghyj7\/i_work_at_a_state_park_and_none_of_us_know_whats\/","flair":"Series","author":"Agreeable-Ease1664","selftext":"Part 6: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/deepnightsociety\/s\/Mih3KxKUHs \n\nThings are really ramping up here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. The weather is getting warmer and that means people want to get outside more. That’s one of the great things about RLHSP, it’s outside. The park gets busier by the day. In the off season we run anywhere from seven to zero people a day entering the park. Once the weather warms up though we might get anywhere between fifty and a hundred people in the park in a single day. During the Summer months it's not uncommon to get even two hundred people here. \n\nI always get a little nervous this time of year. More people in the park means that there are more chances for something bad to happen. On top of your typical outdoor hazards, falling rocks, steep ravines, deep waters, snakes, bees, etc, we have a whole host of other, not so natural, hazards that our park visitors might face. \n\nThankfully Ricky, the plesiosaur that lives in the lake, is a little bit shy, and he doesn’t make too many appearances. I myself have only seen the beast once. But of course there is the squirrel pile, which is unavoidable, but tends to get larger this time of year; more foot traffic seems to stir the squirrels up and they jump off of that cliff in greater numbers. That always seems to freak everyone out. Sometimes we have to clean up the pile everyday this time of year, normally that is only a once a week kind of job. \n\nThings like the Squirrel Pile aren’t really harmful though, unless someone just so happens to be standing right under the exact spot where the squirrels jump from, in which case there might be some problems. But generally speaking that doesn’t happen, at least not that I have heard of. Really it’s the unpredictable things, those strange anomalies that just kind of happen, without any warning, those are the things I worry about. The Pines area in the North with its expanding and contracting trails kind of worries me. People can be lost for days or weeks without even knowing it. Sometimes those weird time dilations happen outside of the Pines too. Then of course there’s this giant tentacled thing in the lake. It has already caused us some serious issues during the off season. Now that the park is getting busier I worry that we will see an influx of problems involving that slimy suction cupped creep. The worst part of it is that none of us that work here have ever really even seen the thing. I think the only good look at it that any of us has gotten was a few months back when it took out that fishing boat and Phil sent me to get the harpoon. I only saw a tentacle, Phil said he saw at least four tentacles. If anyone has seen more of it they have either kept their mouth shut about it or they didn’t live long enough to tell anyone. \n\nSince we’ve been getting more folks coming in and we expect the numbers to keep growing we don’t really get to move at our normal leisurely pace around the park anymore. We’re real busy here cleaning up picnic areas and campsites, cleaning debris off of trails, and getting all of the “ABSOLUTELY NO HIKING BEYOND THIS POINT” signs up in the appropriate places. Also, due to the last two encounters there Phil has, rather intelligently might I add, decided to close off the Rosemary Mine for the season. The Screams are just too frequent anymore and I’m not sure Jordan has really gotten over his encounter with…whatever it was down there. Not to mention that ghost boy that led me on that wild goose chase. \n\nA few days ago I took one of the park's boats out on the lake, to do a sort of rough inventory of the amount of fish we had in the lake. The boat was equipped with all of the typical boating equipment; extra paddles, gas for the motor, life jackets, fish finder, harpoon, dynamite. The fish finder comes in handy for more than just fish finding. Say for instance we’ve got a report of someone missing on the lake. That fish scanner is remarkably good at detecting bodies. Thankfully none of us park staff ever have to fish anyone up off of the bottom of the lake. These men in suits come out and take care of that. That’s only happened twice since I’ve been here though. Thank God.\n\nThat particular day though I was out scanning, looking at all the fish that we had on that little finder screen, when, while on the North side of the lake, I heard someone calling my name. I didn’t recognize the voice at first, but as I moved closer to the shore I saw that it was Ellen. She was standing beneath a Pine tree right at the shoreline waving to me. I pulled the boat up close and tried to talk to her. She had this big stupid smile on her face and I thought maybe the crows had said something funny to her and she wanted to let me in on the joke. \n\n“Hey James,” she said as I pulled up, still smiling ear to ear.\n\n“Hey Ellen. Something funny?” I said, beginning to smile myself.\n\n“Nope! Just happy to see you!” She replied.\n\n“Well then, care to join me? I’m checking the fish population right now.”\n\n“I’d love to!” She said nearly jumping up and down with excitement.\n\nSure I thought it was odd, Ellen is never this interested in me, but part of me thought that my unparalleled charm had finally started to get to her. She climbed in the boat and sat in the passenger seat. I took off again and began checking that scanner looking at all the little red blobs that are supposedly fish. \n\nThen the whole screen went red. I thought maybe it had broken or something. Ellen said something under her breath. I’m not sure what it was, she wasn’t even looking at the screen. It didn’t quite sound like English but I didn’t ask. The screen was red for quite a while. We had made it a little closer to the West shore of the lake before anything happened, the giant red spot had finally gone away, and then it happened.\n\nA gigantic tentacle shot out of the water and towered, what I figured to be, about twenty feet above us. It lingered there, sticking out of the lake like a blasphemous tower, and then, and very suddenly, it came down. It narrowly missed the boat but the resulting tidal wave flipped us sideways and sent the boat down to Hornberry’s Locker. Ellen and I began to swim frantically for the shore. If that thing, that tentacled beast, really wanted to, it could have drug us under. I think it was playing with us, or maybe it just doesn’t like boats. I’m not terribly sure, and if my training at RLHSP has taught me anything at all, it’s that I shouldn’t think about it too long. \n\nNevertheless, Ellen and I made it to shore safe and sound. When at last I had caught my breath I stood and watched the boat's propeller sink beneath the waves, buried in a dirge of bubbles.\n\n“Hey, my cabin’s not too far from here, let’s get up there and get dry huh?” I said to Ellen, who herself was just standing there, staring out at the lake. Her smile had now settled into a blank emotionless expression. \n\n“Yes, sounds good.” She said dryly, even though I watched her face contort into an awkward smile once again. \n\nSo we hiked up the short hill which led to an old service road that eventually winds its way down to my cabin. Ellen didn’t talk the whole way there, even though I tried to start a conversation. I tried a few times actually, but nothing got through. \n\nWe got to my cabin and I pointed her towards the bathroom and told her that she could get dried off first. \n\n“Okay,” was her emotionless reply, though she still had that freaky smile on her face. \n\nWhen she finally stepped out of the bathroom she seemed normal again. Her smile felt more genuine and she stopped with the dry or overly enthusiastic answers. Feeling comfortable once again I thought I’d try to lay the charm down thick. \n\n“You like popcorn?” I said suavely. \n\n“Oh I love it!” She replied.\n\nSo I put a couple bags of corn in the microwave and waited for them to pop. While waiting I walked over to my tv and looked for a movie to put on. I settled on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The one from the 50s. I love old sci fi horror movies. \n\nWith corn popped and the invasion starting, Ellen and I sat down on my couch to enjoy the evening. I must say I was rather surprised at just how flirty she was being. She plopped down right next to me, and over the course of the movie slowly maneuvered her way under my right arm. I was so excited and nervous that I completely ignored the fact that this was a major warning sign. Ellen is never like this, and definitley not with me. \n\nThe next thing I knew I was woken up by the sound of my cabin door slamming into the inside wall. I didn’t even realize I was asleep. Invasion of the Body Snatcher’s was nearly over and I could see by the window that it was dark outside. Ellen was asleep now too, head on my chest. All of this I took in in that brief flash of a second when I spun my head to see who had just barged into my cabin. To my utter horror, it was Ellen. \n\nI looked at her standing at the door, covered in rain drops. Of course it was raining again, seems to rain a lot here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. She had a gun drawn and was breathing heavily. Then I looked down at her asleep on my chest.\n\nI gave Ellen, the one standing at the door, a horrified look, but I still attempted some kind of communication. \n\nThe woman standing at the door was undoubtedly Ellen. When I looked at her it was obvious. It was like the woman I'd been hanging out with all day just hadn't been quite right, and now, when I saw the real thing, it all clicked. The Ellen on my couch, her face, her mannerisms, they weren't right, they hadn't been right all day. The stupid smile, that emotionless stare. It all made sense. But now that the horror of my situation had been fully revealed to me, I didn't know what to do. If I moved, the thing on my couch, that looked like Ellen, might wake up. \n\nThe real Ellen crept over to the back of the couch. She held a finger over her lips. Then, very quickly she grabbed the fake her by the hair, I moved my arm, she pulled the imposter across the couch. I shot up out of my seat and watched as the real Ellen put a pillow over the fake Ellen's face, cocked her gun, and then shot her.\n\nThe thing thrashed and flailed for a while. All the time letting out this inhuman, I dare say otherworldly scream, and then it was silent. The silence slowly engulfed the room and I could now hear the pitter patter of rain on the roof of my cabin. \n\nNow that it was at last safe to speak Ellen and I looked at each other. I'm normally pretty tongue tied around her, but this time I honestly could not think of what to say. \n\n“Uh….” I got out at last.\n\n“Yeah, tell me about it.” Ellen said.\n\n“What is going on?” I asked.\n\n“That thing, that thing with my face, there's several of them, or well…there were several of them. Not all with my face of course. There was one for all of us. That was the last one though. I've been dispatching them all day.”\n\n“But, but, how did you…uh…how did you figure that out?” I asked.\n\n“Because you called me this afternoon.”\n\n“What? I didn't call you. I don't even have your number!”\n\n“Exactly!” \n\n“I'm not following though, how did that tip you off to all of this?” \n\n“Well I'm sitting at home right? Cause you know, everyone got a week off. I'm sitting there watching a movie, when I get a call, unknown number, and when I answer, it's you. You wanted me to come down to the park and help you with something. I just mentioned to you that it was my week off and I'd deal with it when I came back to work. Then I paused for a moment and asked how you got my number. You said that I had given it to you. But I never have given you my number. I knew something was off so I drove up here. I got here just in time to see you take off on the boat out into the lake. But like ten minutes later you came walking up to me in the parking lot by the lodge. But my God, it wasn't you. It wasn't right. You had such a stupid smile on your face, and you didn't stutter even once. I asked you a few other telling personal questions, you failed that test. So...I shot you.”\n\n“What about all the other ones?” I asked her.\n\n“Yes, okay, so there was a Richard, an Aaron, and a Jordan. They've all got the week off too so I knew it wasn't really them. I really don't know what they are, but I knew there had to be a clone of all of us. Didn't see a Phil though. Doesn't matter, I've been hunting myself all night. I had a suspicion, so I came up here.”\n\n“Oh my God. That's just, I don't even know.” I stammered out.\n\n“Yeah well, thanks to me, ‘I’ didn't kill you in your sleep.” \n\n“Yeah, thanks for that,” I stood scratching my head staring at the bloodless body on the floor. As I watched it it shriveled into an Ellen raisin, and then it just kind of evaporated. \n\n“They all did that.” Ellen said as though it was completely normal. \n\nI began to wonder how this little episode might affect my relationship with my coworker. Not to mention how Ellen might feel seeing everyone back at work in a few days. I mean, she had just shot all of them.\n\nEllen was gracious enough not to mention that I had just been on a quasi date with her doppelganger. \n\n“So,” I began. “Would you like some popcorn?”\n\n“Hah! Yeah right. I would like some sleep.” Ellen proceeded to lay down on my couch and was asleep almost as soon as her head touched the arm rest. \n\nNeedless to say I didn't sleep a wink that night. Trust me after a few years working at this place, it takes a lot to keep me from falling asleep. I spent most of the night sitting up in my bed, pistol in hand, staring at the back of my couch. Two doppelgangers of the same person would be ridiculous. But at RLHSP, nothing is impossible. We outta make that a slogan. \n\nIt wasn't another doppelganger though. Ellen woke up around 7 in the morning.\n\n“Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sleep here all night.” \n\n“It's no problem,\" I said, looking back at her with what I was sure were bloodshot and heavily bagged eyes.\n\nShe sleepily left my cabin and as soon as she closed the door behind her I collapsed into the warm embrace of sleep. \n\nI woke up the following day to Phil knocking at my door.\n\n“Where on Earth have you been kid?” I could hear him yelling from the other side of the door. \n\n“Right here old timer!” I yelled back.\n\nRight here, at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. Where nothing is impossible.\n\nWe hope you'll come and visit sometime\n\nUntil then,\n\nJames\n"},"25":{"title":"A Night In","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg841t\/a_night_in\/","flair":null,"author":"SouthernHouseHunting","selftext":"\"Hi mom, what's up?\"  \n\"Hi sweetie.

Enjoy your evening. There's some cold beers in the basement fridge, by the way.\"  \n\"Cool, thanks mom. Later.\" The line clicks and the call gets disconnected.\n\nI'm not surprised. Every time mom and Val have a spa day at the resort a few towns over, I don't see her again until morning. But then, they so rarely get a chance to see each other these days, so I'm just happy mom gets to spend some time with her best friend. I go downstairs, grab some beers from the fridge in the basement and some snacks in the kitchen. It's started raining outside now. I can hear the drops softly pattering on the skylight in the kitchen. The forecast this morning has announced a downpour tonight so I figured it would be a perfect gaming night. I love the sound of rain, it soothes me.\n\nUpstairs in my room, I fire up the old Playstation and before I know it, I find myself in Skyrim. I could play this game forever. There is something about the atmosphere, the first person view, the calm music that is so cozy. It feels like coming home and lulls me into a trance like state of serenity.\n\nI wake up agonizingly slowly. First I become aware of my breathing, then my heavy body and limbs, I feel the dizziness in my head, taste the sleep in my mouth before I can finally open my eyes. It's completely dark all around me. I blink a few times before I can make out the silhouettes of my room's furniture. I hear a hazy sound outside my window that I slowly realize is the rain. It's really coming down now. And then suddenly it hits me: mom. Fuck!\n\nI sit up and look for my phone on my bed. When I unlock the display, my stomach sinks. 02:14 AM. 12 missed calls. 7 text messages, 2 from mom, 5 from my voicemail. A glance at the upper right corner of my display reveals that my phone is still on mute. I gulp and open mom's messages.\n\n*\"What are you doing???\"* 12:36 AM.\n\n*\"I checked into a motel. We'll talk about this in the morning. -Mom\"* 01:21 AM.\n\nOh shit. I quickly dial the number of my voicemail and hold my phone to my ear.\n\n*\"Welcome to voicemail. You have -five- new messages. First new message, received Saturday, September 8th at 11:23 PM:*  \n\"Hi sweetie. It's mom.\" From the sound of it, calling from her car. I can hear the rain hitting her windshield and the softly squeaking sounds of the windshield wipers. \"I'm just leaving the resort, be home in about an hour. Hope you haven't fallen asleep already. Anyway, see you in a bit!\" -**click**\\-\n\n*Second new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:28 AM:*  \n\"Hey sweetie, it's mom. I'm home. Where are you? Tsk, tsk, tsk.\" I hear some clicking like she's pushing the doorbell button. Then silence. She knocks on the door. All the while I can hear the rain all around her. \"I can see the light in the living room is still on. Come on, honey. Pick up, pick up, pick up.\" Silence, rain, more knocking, more rain, then a sigh. \"Uhm... right, I'll go through the garden, hope you haven't forgotten to unlock the backdoor.\" -**click**\\-\n\nMy mind races to last evening. Did I unlock the backdoor? I could swear I did but then clearly that is not the case since mom couldn't get in. I go over the evening in my mind but the more I try to remember, the more the memories slip away.\n\n*Third new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:33 AM*, my voicemail continues without mercy.  \nI hear loud knocking followed by the sound of a door handle that is repeatedly pushed down and released. \"Jesus, Andrew, what are you doing?!\" Mom sounds angry now. \"Let me in, for crying out loud. It's cold and raining and I'm tired.\" Knocking, rain, the door handle, knocking, banging, rain. \"If this is a joke, it's not funny. Pick up the phone, Andrew!\" Silence. Rain. Knocking. Rain. Kicking. Rain. A frustrated growl. \"Goddammit, Andrew!\" -**click**\\-.\n\nWell, there's my answer concerning the backdoor, I suppose.\n\n*Fourth new message, received Sunday, September 9th at 12:34 AM:*  \nBanging on the door. The door handle is being furiously pushed down and released. But this time the sound is different. The sounds are more clear, the rain sounds like a loud patter on a window. A muted growl is heard. \"Goddammit, Andrew!\" That's mom's voice but it sounds muffled, like the rain. My stomach sinks and my heart skips a beat. This recording is clearly from inside the house. \"Andrew, what are you doing?! If this is some kind of prank it's not funny!\" Silence. Banging. Kicking. Rain. \"I can see you behind that curtain, Andrew! Cut it out, now!\"\n\nI can't hear the rest of the message. My hand stiffens, my jaw clenches, my entire body is frozen and my breathing stops as my gaze slowly wanders to my half open door, peering into the darkness outside.\n\nSilence. Rain. Silence."},"26":{"title":"Two weeks ago, a family disappeared while hiking… I hope they’re never found again","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfnc5x\/two_weeks_ago_a_family_disappeared_while_hiking_i\/","flair":null,"author":"lets-split-up","selftext":"We never expected to find them—the family that went missing. The trails had all been combed over the past week and a half. And we were, after all, not experienced hikers ourselves. My sibling Ace and I had never really roughed it, never detoured from established trails. At least, not intentionally.\n\nSomewhere in the pines the official trail markings vanished. Our phones lost all signal, and the narrow track we followed wound upwards along the steady slope through the trees before finally petering out into nothing.\n\nWe were about to turn back when we spotted, just ahead, a clear, smooth patch of land with the remnants of a stone circle for a campfire and some discarded soda cans. Ace grumbled and went to collect the cans—only to call out to me when they found a bright pink backpack. Inside was a notebook, a crumpled paper lunch bag, and a sloth plushie.\n\n“Found a snack for you.” Ace tossed me the lunch bag.\n\n“Dude! That is foul!” Catching the bag, I caught a whiff of the rot inside—remnants of a sandwich, now stale and furry, and a mushy apple. I plucked out the mushy apple and flung it at my older sibling, who swore and ducked. Then together, we both examined the backpack.\n\nThe same thought must have crossed both our minds then—what if the backpack belonged to the family that went missing? We’d strayed off the path. What if this was the same way they came, only they got lost and never found their way back?\n\nAccording to the news, the family—parents Patty and Joel, their daughter Emily, and Patty’s brother Mike—all went missing during what was meant to be an overnight backpacking trip. Witnesses saw them park their car at the trailhead and hike into the crisscrossing, well-worn trails of the pines.\n\nThat was over a week ago.\n\nNow, I squeezed the sloth plushie, its fur matted from being cuddled so long—could this have been the daughter’s? Ace flipped through the notebook, showed me a long-haired stick-figure sketch of “smelly Uncle Mike.” We both smirked, but stopped smiling when flipping to the inside cover revealed a scrawled name: “Emily B.”\n\n“Emily and her uncle, Mike. Those were the names, right?” I said, chilled.\n\n“Shit… yeah.” Ace turned to eye the woods around us. “We need to let the authorities know.”\n\nThe afternoon sunlight slanted down on us. There were no other traces of the family around the campsite. They’d clearly packed up and trekked on from here—but which direction? I scoped out the woods, wandering further out. Something pink fluttered in the distance—\n\n“Rowan! Don’t get lost!” Ace called.\n\nI clambered up through the bramble and over dead leaves and snatched up the pink fabric, caught on a fallen trunk. “It’s a girl’s sweater!” I hollered. Nearby, a trail wound up the slope.\n\nAce’s lanky figure remained rooted far below for several moments. Then, they riffled in their bag, and wrapped some blue tape around a branch by the campsite. They disappeared further downwards—probably to mark where the trail we’d been following petered out. Finally, they clambered up to me. I stood waving the pink fabric impatiently.\n\n“Don’t go running off—” began Ace.\n\n“Look!” I turned the collar of the sweater inside out to show the tag, on which was written in sharpie: *Emily B.* “It looks like there’s a trail that goes up that way,” I added, pointing along the slope.\n\n“That’s not the way we came from though.” Ace squinted up the slope and then back toward the campsite. “We’re way off track…” They tore another piece of blue tape from the roll and added it to a branch nearby.\n\n“We have to find them—” I began.\n\n“We could get just as lost as they are.”\n\n“Ace! We can’t abandon them—”\n\n“Rowan.” Ace’s eyebrows drew together. “We need to call this in. If we wander off into the woods, we might as well just put ourselves on the missing persons list!”\n\nBack and forth we argued. I’m the rash and stubborn one. Ace is the analytical, *equally* stubborn one. Ever since we were kids, I was always the dreamer, ready to set sail on some grand adventure. On my wrist I wore a bracelet reading, “All who wander are not lost.” Whereas my older sibling followed only carefully charted paths, believing only in hard facts, and never in airy possibilities. Today, the moment they suspected we were off trail, they’d started marking branches with their blue painter’s tape and building piles of rocks alongside the path. After assessing the facts of a situation, they made their mind up, solid as bedrock—you’d move a mountain before you could move Ace.\n\nBut you’d stop a bullet train before you could stop me, and I growled, “Think of Emily.” I pointed into the woods. “She’s out there, and she needs her sloth. And if we leave and lose all trace of that lost little girl FOREVER, I will *never* forgive you.”\n\nHesitation on Ace’s face. The sun was sinking lower in the afternoon sky, chills starting up my arms, the rays a burning orange that turned Ace’s mop of brown hair into a golden halo but darkened their features so I could barely see their scowl. If we were going to find this family before nightfall, we had to start looking *now*.\n\nAce made a frustrated sound in the back of their throat. Finally they swore, took out their roll of blue tape, and slammed it into my hand. “This is the STUPIDEST thing you’ve ever done. But fine. You do what you’re gonna do, and I will go call it in and then come back for you. I’ll follow your trail. If you get lost and starve out here and die, I will never, ever forgive *you*. Mark *every fucking tree*, Rowan—”\n\n“I will, promise. I will.”\n\nMy sibling hugged me hard, then they spun on their heel and left. “And for the record!” they shouted over their shoulder. “You are a total moron!”\n\nI flipped them the bird. Without even looking back to see this gesture, Ace was already raising their arm to flip me off in return. Then I turned and scoured the slope above—*there.* It was right there, a well-trodden path, winding upwards. I marked it with the tape and started hiking.\n\nThe temperature seemed to drop as I ascended, as if the air up here was thinner, colder. But the trail itself was wide and free of debris, the afternoon sunlight filtering through the pines and dappling the leaf-strewn trail. It was an easy, uneventful climb—so easy I nearly forgot to mark the trees. It seemed pointless with the path being so clear. I only put up the tape because I’d promised my sibling, making sure that each blue ribbon was in eyeshot of the last.\n\nI’d been hiking for about forty minutes when the path opened up suddenly in front of me, the slope leveling off, and there amidst the trees, in a small clear patch—there was a cabin.\n\nA pink thermos sat on the front steps.\n\nI rushed over and snatched it up. The surface was covered in stickers of anime characters. Emily’s? But then a question entered my mind:\n\n*Why isn’t the cabin on our map?*\n\nI knew it wasn’t on the map because Ace had checked the map relentlessly the moment they realized we were off trail. Maybe it wasn’t there because the map was too old, or because the cabin was privately owned, or maybe we’d strayed so far that both the path I’d hiked and this cabin were in an entirely different area.\n\nBut none of that would explain why the missing family had found this cabin, entered… and remained missing, still.\n\n*They must still be inside.*\n\nWith that thought dread ballooned inside me. If I opened the cabin door, what would I find?\n\nSuddenly I very badly wished that my sibling were with me. I’ve always been the superstitious one, who gets nervous about walking through graveyards at night. Ace never worries about flickering lights or haunted cemeteries or unknown horrors. Ace sees only electrical problems, or soil filled with decaying organic matter. Their fears are always practical: unpaid bills, authoritarian laws, muggings or violence. Never ghosts, curses, or…\n\n… or whatever was waiting in that cabin.\n\nI glanced down at the plush sloth in my hand and back at the ajar door. The windows were cracked and dark. Grime caked the glass. The steps *creeeeeaaaked* as I reached for the door, and I felt my nose wrinkle and my stomach clench because of the smell. A *terrible* smell. It came wafting on the air. Like garbage and sewage and meat left out to fester.\n\nAn unbearable chill numbed my arm the moment I gripped the knob, and I braced myself and thrust the door open.\n\nTo my surprise, not only was the cabin brightly lit, but several faces turned toward me. A thin, tired-looking man raised a hand to his lips for silence.\n\n“Wha—Are you Joel?” I asked.\n\nThe man motioned to his lips again, more desperately. A woman at the seat across from him glared at me and shook her head. Her mouth had strange markings across her lips—like she’d drawn stitches over them. A little girl next to the woman looked at me anxiously, her eyes widening as she noticed the tattered sloth in my hand.\n\nThe last person, a long-haired man seated next to the tired-looking man, did not turn around in his seat or move at all, and I could only see the back of his head.\n\nAll four of them had their hands holding each other’s on the table, except for the finger that Joel had raised to silence me. He motioned me to sit in the chair to his left.\n\nThis was so strange. I had so many questions. I came over and pushed the sloth toward the little girl, saying as I sat down, “Are you Emily? People have been—”\n\n“*Shhhh*.” Again the finger at his lips in a stern reprimand, and then the door to the cabin slammed open.\n\nI yelped, gasping as a hand gripped mine firmly—Joel had hold of my arm—he jerked me closer and pointed to himself, to his eyes, and closed them. I glanced to his wife, his daughter, already with their eyes squeezed shut. That was all the warning I had before I heard the footsteps, and I started to turn my head—\n\nHis fingers dug into my arm.\n\nI squeezed my eyes closed.\n\n*Something* stepped inside through the open door. *Thud. Thud.* The scuff of footsteps on the wooden slats. And the sound of chuckling.\n\nThere was something vaguely familiar about the voice. I couldn’t place it, but the longer I listened, the more familiar it seemed, like a word on the tip of my tongue, or a name I couldn’t quite remember to a familiar face.\n\nThe footsteps, and the soft cackling, drew closer. There was also something unpleasant with the footsteps. A smell. The waft of something rotten, or maybe of body odor. And then a whisper in my left ear, as if lips were just next to my skin. A cold, rotten breath. I think it whispered my name.\n\nThe fingers on my arm tightened in warning.\n\nThe whispering moved, now to my right ear. *Thud. Thud.* The footsteps moved around the table. I almost opened my eyes to see who or what was in the cabin with us—but instinct told me not to look.\n\nThe steps circled around the room, and then receded out the door, which clicked shut.\n\nThe pressure on my hand eased, and I opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was four faces turned towards me, three of them anxious and worried. Joel, his wife Patty with her stitched lips (Oh God, were the stitches real?), their little daughter Emily. But the fourth face—I gasped, and Joel’s hand squeezed mine again, *hard*, reminding me not to speak. Or scream.\n\nSitting next to Joel was the long-haired man who must have been Uncle Mike, in a worn jean jacket, recognizably the long-haired stick figure drawing from Emily’s notebook. But where his eyes should have been were gaping bloody sockets, and his mouth was also stitched with thick black thread.\n\nJoel tapped a finger on the table and pointed to the center.\n\nFor the first time, I saw the words etched into the wood:\n\nSPEAK, AND BE SILENCED.\n\nLOOK, AND BE BLINDED.\n\nLEAVE, AND BE BOUND.\n\nWHEN THE LAST CHAIR IS FILLED, YOU WILL BE FREE.\n\nMy gaze lifted again to Uncle Mike, and then passed across the faces of the other three, looking at me with anguish. I bolted upright, but Joel seized me, shaking his head fiercely. He jabbed a finger at Emily. At first I thought he was saying, *Don’t you dare abandon my daughter.* But then I realized he was pointing at her hands. She had not reached to pick up her sloth, despite having looked longingly toward it. Then I saw the little girl’s frightened eyes drift from me to her hands. Her hand holding her mother’s. And her other hand on the table.\n\nThey weren’t *holding* hands.\n\nTheir hands were nailed to the table.\n\nJoel squeezed my arm again and mouthed the words: *LEAVE, AND BE BOUND.*\n\nAll the air left my lungs. I collapsed back into my seat. The wheels of my mind ground to a halt with panic. *Impossible*, was all I kept thinking. *Impossible. Impossible.* Terror numbed my brain, blocking all rational thought. Who was keeping them captive? Why? And why did their captor sound so familiar? Next to me, Joel still held a grip on my arm, but used his other arm to push the sloth to his daughter. She laid her head down on the plush fur. “Thank you,” she mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded numbly. I couldn’t speak, so I carefully freed my arm from Joel’s grip and mouthed slowly, “Are there cameras? How is he watching you?”\n\nConfusion on Joel’s face. I repeated the mouthed question, and then I started tracing out letters on the table. His gaze followed and he nodded. In this painstaking way, we were able to have a conversation.\n\nMe: Who is he?\n\nJoel: We don’t know.\n\nMe: How long have you been here?\n\nJoel and Patty shrugged. Tears from Emily who only shook her head.\n\nMe: Does he always know if you try to leave?\n\nMore helpless shrugging. Joel eventually conveyed to me that Emily and Uncle Mike were the ones who spotted the path and found the way to the cabin. It looked dilapidated to Joel, but Emily and Uncle Mike thought they heard someone calling from inside, so the whole family entered. That’s when they noticed the writing on the table. They were trying to decipher what it meant when *it* came inside. Uncle Mike had *looked*, and *it* had taken his eyes while he screamed at everyone else to run. Patty took Emily one way while Joel ran the other. Joel tried to lead their pursuer off, but he got lost in the woods. Patty and Emily somehow got turned around while fleeing and wound up back at the cabin with *it* on their heels. They tried to hide inside and barricade the door, but *it* forced the door open. By the time Joel returned to the cabin he found his wife and daughter with their hands nailed to the table, his wife with her mouth sewn shut.\n\nNow, he traced out his message on the table with his finger while mouthing the words.\n\nJoel: I can’t leave them.\n\nI pointed to myself and mouthed words as I traced back: You don’t have to. *I’ll* escape and get help.\n\nJoel: But you would need a distraction to even get out of the cabin.\n\nMe: Can you distract it long enough for me to get clear?\n\nJoel gave me a pained look. It was obvious he was afraid of bringing even more harm on himself and his family.\n\nMe: I’ll bring help! It’s the only way to save Emily!\n\nJoel shook his head and sighed. But his wife, who could neither speak nor move her hands, stomped her foot and caught his eye. She gave a fierce nod. Emily looked at me with shining eyes. “Thank you for my sloth,” mouthed the little girl. “Please save us.”\n\nJoel exhaled and pressed his palms to his eyes. I didn’t know if he was scared, or just in despair. But he sat like that for a long time and finally he turned his head to me and actually shouted, “RUN!!”\n\nHis booming voice startled me out of my chair. Behind me, the door burst open. “Don’t look!” Joel added as he lunged past me, putting himself between me and the intruder, and I don’t know if his eyes were open or not. All I know is he screamed, and Emily let out a sob, and I felt my way blindly to the wall and along it toward the door even as that sinister chuckling passed right by my ear. Joel groaned, and there was a loud *WHAM* as he was slammed back into his seat. And then the *thud thud thud* of a hammer.\n\nThen I was outside! Pulling the door shut behind me, I opened my eyes and bolted for the trees.\n\nThe sky was deep purple, just enough light for me to see. How many hours had passed? How long ago had sun set? I ran down the slope, and ran, and ran, and ran, not even caring which direction. All I thought was, *AWAY!* My legs and lungs burned as I flew down the slope—\n\nAnd stumbled to a halt, because in front of me was the cabin.\n\nLaughter sounded from inside. The door creaked open.\n\nTurning away, I sprinted back into the woods. By now I had a stitch in my side. This time I went upwards.\n\nI was still stumbling through the bracken when the chuckling, which had been behind me, was suddenly in front of me. No matter how many times I tried to go deeper into the woods, the laughter of that maddeningly familiar voice kept returning, too close, herding me back, and sometimes calling my name: “Rowaaaaaaan…”\n\nAnd then I was at the cabin again, all the wind gone from my lungs, the voice whispering my name just behind me.\n\nNO!\n\nI rushed inside and slammed the door shut.\n\nJoel’s hands were nailed to the table. His eyes were squeezed shut. Patty and Emily looked at me in despair.\n\nI took my place quickly. Then the door burst open.\n\n*THUD THUD*—footsteps, clunking fast after me, and then that rotten breath wafting into my ear, heavy and close, fingers squeezing into my shoulder.\n\nPanicked, flailing, I fought blindly against my assailant’s grip. My fist connected with a *smack* against skin and bone, but the—thing? Person?—was unfazed, the grip tightening, stronger than ever, and the thing was laughing. Laughing in my ear.\n\n“NOOOO!” The scream tore from my throat.\n\nROWAAAAN, its eerily familiar voice growled in my ear. It didn’t sound human. And yet I *knew* its voice, familiar the way a tune is familiar when you’ve forgotten the words. A tune like a lullaby. Like I’d known this thing from before I was even born.\n\n“LET ME GO!!!” I shrieked.\n\nI screamed, I spat, I fought with everything I had, but its powerful grip only dug in harder, more painfully, like talons. I felt myself dragged, writhing, from my chair, my heels scraping across the floorboards as it hauled me across the cabin floor—\n\n“ROWAN! ROWAN, STOP IT! IT’S ME, ACE!”\n\nSuddenly it was just a voice—a human voice—barking at me over and over as I was hauled down the creaking steps and into the dirt. Ace’s lanky silhouette leaned over me, their face flushed as they panted with exertion.\n\nGasping, I blinked up at my sibling. The sun was so low in the sky that the stars shone through the skeletal branches.\n\n“Ace?” I groaned.\n\n“Yes—thank fuck!” gasped Ace, dropping down into the dirt beside me. “Oh thank fuck! I think you broke my nose…”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“What *happened?* Hell if I know! Why were you sitting in there holding hands with rotting corpses?”\n\nCorpses?\n\nI whirled to look back at the cabin. We were in the dirt just below the front steps. The door hung open. Inside was dark, but the smell… the smell that wafted out made my stomach buck. Ace snatched my arm and pulled me towards the trees. “Let’s get the fuck away—”\n\nI jerked back instinctively—“But, Emily,” I said. I was too confused to do much more than cast a quick look behind me as my sibling tugged me into the pines. The cabin looked even more dilapidated than I remembered, the window panes cracked and missing and the roof sagging like it was about to collapse. Through the darkness of the open door, I could make out vague shapes, still and solemn, positioned around the table—\n\nAnd then Ace was pulling us into the bramble. I asked why we didn’t take the path back down, and my older sibling snapped, “There’s no path. I was barely able to find your markers.”\n\nIt felt like I was lost between dream and wakefulness, in some strange limbo while Ace shined their phone flashlight around, trying desperately to catch the beam on the occasional blue tape wound round branches, or on piles of stones or pieces of clothing tied around trees—apparently Ace had supplemented my trail with their socks, a headband, and other items from their pack. Even so, it was harrowing trying to find our way through the darkening twilight. We reached the campsite just as pitch black descended.\n\n“Are the police coming?” I asked.\n\n“No.” Ace still had hold of my hand, as if afraid to let go. “I didn’t get very far before I decided I’d rather die being stupid with you than go for help and risk losing you.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nSo. There were no authorities coming to look for us.\n\nWe built a small fire and huddled together to wait for dawn while Ace told me slowly, haltingly, what they’d seen.\n\nThey followed my blue tape trail to the cabin and found me sitting at the table, eyes squeezed shut. When I didn’t react to my name being called, they noticed the family appeared to have simply died sitting around the table holding hands. And I was holding their hands, too. It freaked them out. Then they saw one of the family had no eyes—that the eyes had been wrenched out and one of the eyeballs was held in the free hand. The man had apparently plucked out his own eyes. Between this and the reek of decomposition, Ace rushed out and threw up. When they finally stopped being sick and came back inside to get me, I came bursting out past them and ran—ran and ran and ran, and they chased me around the cabin two or three times before they found me sitting back in the chair holding hands again. That’s when they grabbed me, and I punched them in the nose.\n\n“Oh,” I said quietly. And then, dreading the answer: “Did you… see anything on the table?”\n\nAce was silent for a long time before grunting, “Yeah… Something about ‘when the last chair is filled.’ And it was freaky as shit, because all the chairs were filled except the last one.” A strange laugh bubbled in their throat. “Y’know I almost felt like sitting down? Weird impulse.”\n\n*Thank God you didn’t*, I thought. It was Ace’s total lack of imagination, their dismissal of that thought as nonsensical, that probably saved them *and* me.\n\nWe waited until the sky turned grey, and then we finally staggered to our feet and found our way to the deer trail and back to civilization, where we reported our finding of the missing family.\n\n… But the family is still missing. The authorities got as far as the campsite before being unable to follow our markers. They are all still there, their spirits trapped within that cabin. Nailed for eternity, for as long as their souls will have to wait. Waiting for me to bring help. I’m sure I could find my way, but… I’m too afraid. I don’t know what happens if that last chair is filled. I know something will change, but the thought of it happening fills me with the deepest, most terrible dread.\n\nIf I tell you where to look, will you go and save Emily?\n\nYou wouldn’t be stuck forever, I don’t think.\n\nWHEN THE LAST CHAIR IS FILLED, YOU WILL BE [FREE.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/QuincyLee\/comments\/11nxwz3\/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by\/)"},"27":{"title":"This Job Interview Almost Killed Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg6g5u\/this_job_interview_almost_killed_me\/","flair":null,"author":"Street_Chrome","selftext":"After weeks of annoying the police, they finally look inside the building.

I scrolled through jobs, quickly reading their requirements and salaries. I wasn’t looking for anything specific or taking it seriously, I was passing time. At one point the jobs became too weird or had little to no information. I sent my resume to a few entry level jobs, not expecting to hear back from any of them.\n\n“You hear this guy?” Seymour said while grabbing my forearm, snapping me back to reality. “He said that Star Trek: The Next Generation is overhyped.” He turns to John. “You know it was the highest rated show of its time.”\n\n“I’m not saying it wasn’t awful, but it was on the verge of being cancelled for a reason. Their writing was bad.” \n\n“It’s space camp.” Yelled Seymour.\n\n“Bad first two seasons.” John reiterated.\n\n“I’m gonna go out for a smoke.” I announced, the bar was packed but I managed to squeeze past the crowd.\n\nLighting my camel blues I sat on a stoop next door. The night was busy, drunk white people were walking the streets. I scrolled some more until I reached the ninth post on the thirteenth page.\n\n**Entry Level Account Managers - Urgently Hiring!!!**\n\nNY Bankers  \n\n**Job Details** \n\n**$41,000 - $62,000 a year ++**\n\n**Commission Pay** \n\n**Full-time**\n\n**Full Job Description** \n\nWe are looking for recent grads and motivated individuals to join our diverse company.

Just two taps on my phone and they have my contact information. \n\nThe next day I was hung over, and very hungry, my roommates were cooking. I staggered to the bathroom with my towel and loofa. The warm shower woke me up. \n\nRING!\n\nAn unknown number. I let it go to voice mail.\n\nRING!\n\nI silence it.\n\nRING\n\nI angrily turned off the water and answered.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hi is this Austina?\"\n\n“Yes. Who is calling?”\n\n“I’m Brian!” He sounded positive and chirpy. “I’m with New York Bankers. We saw your application on For Hire and we’d love for you to come to the office for an interview. We’re having a interview event today and we can squeeze you in.” Brain said with much enthusiasm.\n\n“Today is Sunday. You guys work Sunday?”\n\nHe chuckles lightly. “ Yeah. When the banks close, New Yorkers are open! We pride ourselves on filing, account managing, and book keeping for New Yorkers any day of the week. Holidays and weekends!”\n\n“Well, today isn’t great for me. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?”\n\n“Tomorrow?” He sounded hurt. “ Tomorrow we won’t be doing interviews, today is your only chance. We’re gonna be here till 3pm.”\n\nI didn’t know how to get out of this conversation.\n\n“Look Austina. You’re probably having second thoughts right now. It’s a Sunday you probably want to stay in bed all day right. I would too, but I wouldn’t be in the office right now, if I knew there wasn’t money to be made here. NY Bankers is a fast paced work environment we work closely with our clients and they’ve come to trust us. We offer paid training and large commissions. If you want to start making a lot of money this is your chance. \n\n“Sure. I can come in at 1:30pm.” I caved to Brian’s sale. He gives an address. It’s by Union Square park. He tells me how lucky I am to get this opportunity and what it means to be apart of New York Bankers. I hang up and return to my shower.\n\nI finished my shower, quickly dried myself, put on my pjs, grabbed my laptop and typed New York Bankers.\n\nI found a website of a stock photo slide of New York City. Each photo had blurbs about their company. They were all vague and meaningless attributes of their performances. Quotes of their accomplishments from random “clients.” Whenever I clicked on anything outside of the home page it lead me to a construction page. I’d seen enough. These guys are scammers, I closed my laptop and laid on my bed. I decided not to go. I looked at the job posting on my phone. I was thinking about reporting the post until the idea came to me.\n\nI grabbed my suit jacket, put my phone in the front chest pocket, camera facing out. It was a perfect fit, the camera was above the flap. I hit record and did some test shots. The footage is good, but the sound wasn’t.\n\nFound my good tape, cut out little squares and taped a LAV mic cable on my chest. I connected it to my phone via a small hole behind my chest pocket, hide it well. It looked really discreet, no one could tell I was recording them. Finally I moisturized, dried my hair, picked out the rest of my outfit and left confident in this interview.\n\nThere was a farmer’s market happening, I bought coffee and doughnuts and went across the street to NY Bankers. It was a corner glass building, 12 stories tall with a balcony patio. The building reflected the blue sky from every angle like it was apart of the sky. Beautiful, reflective and bright.\n\nThere was one banner inside, it hung behind the front desk. Despite the people walking around me, no one seemed to notice that this building exists. There was no one in the lobby, it was empty. I went through the revolving door.\n\nAn empty black marble room, cool A.C, one long red mat that lead to a hallway. The banner had an outline of the five boroughs with the word “Bankers” spelled across it.\n\nDown the carpet was an elevator.\n\nDING!\n\nInside there was only one glowing button. Five.\n\nDING! Men and women in suits sat on black cushion seats against a white wall. A male receptionist looked at me. \n\n“You must be Austina! I’m Brian.” He had the same cheery personality she heard on the phone.\n\n“Am I late?”\n\n“No. You’re right on time.” He points to the large lobby room where men and women were sitting. “Take a seat with the rest.” It doesn’t matter where.\"\n\nThere was one seat open in the middle. I had a clear view into the office, I got a pan shot of the office as discreetly as I could.\n\nFour rows of desks with men and women hunched over typing, reading, talking and calculating. Few were silently arguing in their phones, trying not to disturb the peace. Others had small talk by the water cooler, few were at the patio. They all looked middle aged and most of them were large and tall. Most of them were white, few were black and brown. \n\nIt seemed like another world, I had so many questions. They all ignored us and looked into their computer screens. Some were happy, others had no expression at all.\n\n“Hey. How long have you been waiting?” I whispered to the tall black women to my left. \n\n“Ten minutes.” \n\n“Isn’t this strange?”\n\n“No, It’s an off market trading company. Large accounts making their next move.”\n\n“That sounds illegal.”\n\n“Look at that man, in the red shirt, in the back.” She nods her head to a man with a red shirt and grey pants. “He never puts the phone down. He’s making calls. To who? Families that rest on Sundays.”\n\n“Shady. All of it’s shady.”\n\n“Money is money if it’s dirty or clean.”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“You can call me Patrica.” \n\n“I’m Austina.”\n\n“That’s such a white girl’s name.” \n\n“Hey, this is my city. I ain’t getting scammed by these idiots. Think about what they’ll make us do?”\n\n“Learn to take the money. People with gold don’t let go.”\n\n“You are something you know that?” \n\nShe chuckles. “I’m the whole package.” \n\nWe waited for fifteen minutes. The office seemed to be in a loop. One conversation begin, another ends, when that one ends, a new one begins. They were lively for a Sunday. \n\n“Hey Brian?” I walked up to the desk. He looks up from his desktop. “Who are these people? When you said you work Sunday, I wasn’t sure what to expect.”\n\nHe chuckles at the question. “So these guys are our senior staff. They’ve been with us longer and have clients that require special attention.” Brian said. “Think of us as an accounting firm, but you don’t have to worry about working weekends. New hires have regular hours. Today is the only time our hiring manager can conduct interviews.” \n\n“How long have y’all been open?”\n\n“We opened at 2020. We began working remote but are slowly letting senior staff in.”\n\nAn older man with a large stomach and a tucked in blue shirt. “Hello Brian. Is this everyone?” \n\n“Yes. They are all accounted for.”\n\n“Are you one of them?” The older man looks at me.\n\n“Yes.” I say proudly. “I’m Austina.”\n\nHe holds his hand out, we have a firm handshake.\n\n“Great! Join your colleagues, we’re moving on soon.” He said. I sit back down. He pulls up his pants and steps forward to the line of people. “Thank you for arriving, especially on a Sunday. I’m Alexander, the hiring manager. If you all follow me, I’ll lead you all to another waiting room.” \n\nWe all chuckle. \"Please have your resume ready.” He announced.\n\nThe hairs on my arms raised, my shoulders shivered. Keeping my smile and composure, I stayed cool. I was so focused on my outfit, I forgot to print my resume, I was racking my brain trying to figure how I can do this.\n\nAlexander lead us to another waiting room. This time the seats were across from three conference rooms. We had a clear view of the conference room and interview. The walls and door were glass. Three men sat at the far left end of the conference table. They looked like Alexander. Big gut and tucked in dress shirts.\n\n“Okay everyone grab a seat. The first interview will take about twenty minutes, afterwards we’ll ask a couple of people to stay for a second interview. Thank you for your patience.” He pulls the door open. “Okay let’s start from the left side.” He point at a young man with a blue shirt and black suit. He follows Alexander inside. \n\nSweat runs down my temple. Other applicants have their printed resume on their laps. \n\nOne by one we go into the conference room. Alexander does most of the talking while the applicant listens. They do ask for the resume. The other men only ask one question then Alexander talks a bit more. \n\nIt was my turn. Alexander points to me, welcomes me in the conference room. My heart races, avoiding his blue eyes. He closes the door behind me. He joins the rest of fat old men. None of them introduced themselves, they all nod at me.\n\n“You’re Austina?” the first large man asks.\n\nHe gestures to the seat, but I don’t sit. “Yup that’s me! I applied last night and got a call from Brain this morning! I’m very curious about this place. I’m excited to learn from y’all.”\n\n“Do you have your resume?” Alexander asks.\n\nMy heart beats like crazy. My back stiffens, I clenched my fists, cleared my throat and answered truthfully. \n\n“You don’t need my resume.” They share a look of confusion. “A good saleswoman doesn’t need references or experience. All that we need is ourselves and a friendly attitude. My pervious jobs won’t tell you anything that will satisfy you.” Unbuttoning my suit jacket. “ Let me repeat that, nothing I say can satisfy you. What matters is the thick of my skin and my smart head. Every New Yorker has gotta be tough. So let me tell you about me. Stuff I’m proud of. I was born and raised in New York City. I went to college for two years and returned to the city to build my net worth. Currently I’m working in Macy’s selling perfume. A very high commission job with a lot of competition.”\n\n“What were you studying?” The second large man asks.\n\n“Communication and Media. Social Media skills.” \n\n“That’s a very popular field. Why did you leave college?” Alexander follows up. \n\n“The college didn’t have a great communication department. There weren’t enough courses for people in my major. It didn’t live up to my expectation.”\n\n“Do you plan to go back?” The third large man asks. \n\n“No. I believe the greatest learning tool is first hand experience.” I stood up. “You see before I worked in Macy’s I interned at Buzz Feed. I learned a lot from them, how to manage social media and SEO. One thing I learned is the value of an image.”\n\nI stepped closer to the large men.\n\n“You see presentation matters, sure. But what’s really important is the substance. If we aren’t authentic to ourselves and others then how can anyone believe anything that we are selling? Consistency and Communication are the most important traits for entrepreneurs. In our modern age anyone can be anything with a instagram post. Who we are is a front, what counts is what we're selling.” \n\n“How are you in accounting and filing?” The second large man asked.\n\n“I have the memory of an elephant. I had great experience working with analytics and data sets. One of my tasks at Buzz Feed was predicting our engagement.”\n\n“How long did you work at Buzz Feed, why did you leave it for Macy’s?” The third large man asks.\n\n“Simple. My goal is to own and operate my own social media app. Buzz Feed was a great experience for me to see how a media company operates. Macy’s is a way to support myself as I build my own app from my room.” \n\n“That’s very ambitious. Does anyone support you?” Alexander asks.\n\n“Nope. I live alone, I’ve dumped all my savings into this project. I’ve been doing this for the past two years.”\n\n“Wow. What attracted you to this job?” The first large man asks. \n\n“Simple, the management experience. I would love to learn how you all work with clients and meet their need. I know my company will have difficulties and hiccups, but a good leaders needs to work under strenuous circumstances. A good leader will make it work. I can’t wait to get started and prove to you that I’m an exceptional saleswomen and leader.”\n\n“Austina. Thanks for your time. Return to your seat. Please stick around.” Alexander says as he opens the door for me. He points at Patrica, she goes inside.\n\nMy heart calms down. Breathing in and out, the blue sky from the patio calms me.\n\nI take my seat and rest my head against the wall. I wipe the sweat from my brow and the watch the other applicants go in the conference room, one by one. After the last one, Alexander steps in front of us. “Thank you for waiting. We appreciate everyone for spending their Sunday with us. I’m gonna go through a list of names, these are people who we believe aren’t suited for the job. We’re looking for people who have certain skills that we believe can improve our company.” \n\nAlexander goes through a list of names. “Unfortunately I wish I could hire you all. Please leave your resume at the front desk.  We appreciate you coming here, but we’re going with the other candidates.” My name wasn’t called.\n\n“Everyone who is staying please stay here. We’ll have lunch ready soon.”\n\nHalf of the applicants leave. Patrica stays. \n\n“What did y’all talk about?” She asks me.\n\n“Nothing. I just told them about background.”\n\n“Me too. Nothing about the job.”\n\nThe last of the people left.\n\nAlexander and the other interviewers stood in front of us. The light go out, everyone puts away their phones.\n\n“Well lunch is served.” \n\nSuddenly they began unbuttoning their shirts. All the office workers stood up, doing the same. \n\n“What are you doing?” I yelled.\n\nAlexander ignored my objection, he kept unbuttoning. Their stomachs aren’t stomachs. A lip? A seam like a long scar, but it had a different skin tone. Alexander’s stomach was opening. It was happening everywhere. The office workers began changing. Everyone burst out of their clothes, naked and wide open. Their skin changed to a pale color. Their stomaches unfolded, their ribcages are teeth. \n\nA mouth opens, wider and taller than Alexander. I didn’t scream or run, the red flesh of the mouth-stomach opened up and licked its ribcage-teeth.\n\nA wide slimy red tongue latches on me and pulls me inside its mouth. In a matter of seconds the mouth closes on me, it's pitch black. Its teeth pierced my ankles, it tries to bite my head but I dodged the canines. I scream, writhed, kicked and punched everything I could. Nothing freed me from the tongue.\n\nI saw the sharp tooth from the corner of my eye. I swerved my head left, barely missing it. I could feel the teeth crunch down on my ankles. Everything kept getting tighter, it wanted to finished its meal.\n\nWith sheer force I pushed my left arm against the tongue to give myself some space. With my right arm, I reached for my suit pocket. I grabbed my phone and pull out the LAV mic wire. I balled it up in my left hand.\n\nI tied the wire around the tongue, luckily it was long enough, and strangled the muscle with all my strength, I screamed “Let me out!\"\n\nSuddenly something echos, a scream from deeper inside. Gurgles of flesh and monstrosity. Real light peeked from behind me. I didn’t let go until I saw the office ceiling. The gurgles turned to a monstrous scream.\n\nIt spat me out on the floor, I scramble to my feet and I ran towards the exit. I ignored the pain as much as I could but my left ankle was like a dog’s chew toy. I hid behind an office desk and bandaged my foot with a cloth from my suit. I looked at the office and I didn’t know what I was looking at.\n\nThey were all large, tall, and wide, there was nothing human. It was like a Venus flytrap but with arms and a tongue. A large set of teeth and a pair avian arms like a bat. It’s jaw rested on the floor along with some lumps of fat.\n\nTheir mouth-stomaches were gnawing and chewing on the applicants. Few were pulling apart their limbs. Others chewed with their mouths open. Chucks of human flesh were minced by the sharp teeth of their mouth-stomaches. Patrica was gone, I looked for anyone alive. The red shirt was backed in a corner, they surrounded him, three monsters ripped him apart. His clothes and blood flew everywhere.\n\nSaliva drooled down their lips. The munching and gnawing filled the room. It smelled foul. I kept moving towards the hallway, sticking to the desks. They ignored me, too busy with their food. I came to the elevator, I kept pushing the button.\n\nI finally looked back at the monster that I came out of, it writhes in pain. Others attended to the injured one, they helped him stand up, they rubbed his mouth-stomaches. They turn around to the patio and climb up a ramp? \n\nThey walked past the patio railing, on the blue sky. Each step they took revealed an invisible ramp. A bright light appears just above them. Another room. I caught a glimpse of a grey room with long reflective panels. Alien letterings and icons. In the center, the creatures laid on their side, their stomach mouths eating huge plates of meats. They only wore gold necklaces.\n\nBefore the injured monster enters the invisible room, it yells something, a word, a sentence? I don’t understand it but everyone stops. Their yellow eyes stare at me. They all finish chewing their food and get up. \n\nThey run towards me! \n\nDING!\n\nI step in and hold the close button. \n\nIt closes just before one of them reached me.\n\nI put my back against the wall.\n\nDING!\n\nI run across the lobby. I push through the rotating door and bolt out of there. I run across the street, but the park was empty. I ran into the subway and tried to find a cop. \n\nFinally I see a cop, a human, waiting by the subway gate. I grabbed his arm and yell “I need your help!” I leaned on him, start to heave and cry. Frantically explaining what happened to me and why I’m covered in red slime. He tries to calm me down, I know I sounded insane, but I had to show someone the monsters posing as bankers. He might’ve believed me, but he talks into his radio and calls for a medic. He brings me back outside where an ambulance arrive. I frantically tell them to check the building and go to the fifth floor. The cop assures me that he will, but I know he won’t. Medics surround me, they rest me on their stretcher and treat my ankles.\n\nDetectives are the first to greet me, I tell them everything that happened. They can’t search the building unless they have a warrant. They ask me how I got in. “It was unlocked.” I answered. “I went inside and took the elevator to the fifth floor.\n\n“That building hasn’t been leased in years. We called the owner, no one has been inside.” The detective said.\n\n“But I applied to a job on Now Hiring. Their receptionist called me and asked me to go there for a job interview.”\n\n“You did an interview with Human-eating alien monster?\"\n\n“I FORGOT MY RESUME! I SAT ACROSS A WORKING OFFICE FULL OF PEOPLE! THERE WERE OTHER APPLICANTS! PATRICA IS MISSING! NEW YORK BANKERS! WHEN BANKS ARE CLOSED, NEW YORKERS ARE OPEN! THEY CALLED ME! I SAW THEM TURN INTO MONSTORS! THEY TRIED TO EAT ME!” "},"28":{"title":"I found the love of my life and I thought she was my soulmate…","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgcvar\/i_found_the_love_of_my_life_and_i_thought_she_was\/","flair":null,"author":"NathanielPhoenix","selftext":"**I met my wife a long time ago and thought our life was perfect. Our life was perfect until I discovered something horrible.** \n\nSo I was 18 years old at this time of my life and I wanted to marry someone really badly. I went to bars a lot to search for a woman suitable for me. I wanted a loving, caring and motherly woman who would care for our kids. \n\nI wanted to have at least two children. \n\nSo one night I went to this bar. I believe it was called Craig’s bar and restaurant. It was a nice small and cozy place where you could drink in peace and have good conversations with people without the music being too loud. There were people dancing on the dance floor. Then I spotted this beautiful woman.\n\n She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had long hair that was a deep red colour. Amazing facial features and an astonishing body. I felt butterflies.  \n  \nI got nervous as I realized that I had to go talk to her. I shook off the nerves and approached her. ‘’ Hey, What’s up?’’ I started casually. Her answer took a while but then she said ‘’Nothing much. Just vibing’’. I could feel that she found me attractive. “Want to grab a drink with me?” I asked. Took a lot of courage to get those words out but I was glad I did. “Sure!” \n\nWe walked to the bar counter and I ordered a beer and she ordered a cider. After that we got ourselves a table and sat down. We talked about life and about everything. I fell in love, I could feel we had good chemistry and I asked for her number but she insisted that I’d spend the night at her place and so I did. Nothing sexual happened but we slept in the same bed and the conversation that started at the bar didn’t end until we fell asleep.  \n  \nHer name was Rosanne and she had really beautiful green eyes I couldn’t see at the bar. They almost looked like they belonged to a snake.\n\nThe next morning I woke up feeling like shit. “Heyy! You’re up” she yelled all excitedly. I flinched as I thought I was home alone. “Hey! you scared me,” I told her and barely got a word out as my mouth was so dry. “Did you sleep well?” I asked. “Yep” she told me and went to the kitchen.  \n  \nShe came back in 15 minutes and brought me breakfast to bed. ‘’Ohhh nice! Thank you so much’’ I said to her while giggling like a little kid.‘’I love cooking and I thought you deserved a homemade breakfast’’ She answered and blushed. So we spent the whole day in bed and I spent another night there. The next day I went home and talked to her on the phone. Actually after those two nights spent there I called her every day. We usually talked for a couple of hours and got to know each other so well. We also went on dates every other weekend. She was perfect for me. I wanted her to be my wife and soulmate for the rest of my life. I was also perfect for her or so I thought. It felt so sudden, how could I fall in love so quickly?\n\nA year goes by and it was awesome. I proposed and we got married. The wedding was small and modest. We invited only a handful of people and it went really well. It was simple but effective. At one point my wife disappeared and came back hours later. It was weird and a bit rude to the guests. Her dad came to me at one point and said ‘’Where is Rosanne? She always disappears at the worst moments.’’ Whatever that meant.  \n  \nShe seemed completely normal after she was back. At one point though I was sure I saw her pickup a frog and put it in her pocket. “What is she going to do with that?” I thought but left it at that. I figured she was just drunk and wanted to prank me as I was pretty drunk too.  I can’t even remember anything after that. The wedding was perfect.A month later we were out eating at a restaurant. ‘’How do you feel about having kids?’’ I asked.   \n  \nI had been thinking of having kids for six months and she would make the perfect mother. ‘’I don’t like kids. They are loud and they smell,’’ She answered. ‘’Have you thought about us having kids? I would love to have at least one,’’ I told her all excitedly. ‘’No my darling. I don’t think that is such a good idea,’’ she told me. I was dumbfounded.‘’What do you mean?’’ I asked. She told me that she can’t be around kids for some reason but I deserved them and some day she would be ready. The woman I married didn’t want kids with me, why?  \n  \nWe left the conversation at that. I kept thinking about it for a couple of weeks but figured out she would tell me when she was ready for kids. \n\nAfter that night she woke me up by bringing me breakfast. ‘’Good morning my handsome prince’’ She said and gave me a plate full of eggs. bacon and beans. ‘’That was really kind of you my dear’’ I told her while smiling very widely. She always made me breakfast on the weekends. It was the best.\n\nThe next week, my wife disappeared again. It was Saturday and we watched a movie on our couch. Suddenly she leaves in a hurry and the weirdest thing is that she didn’t even say anything, she just left. She came back 3 hours later. It was almost midnight and that was weird.  \n  \nI was just watching the movie alone when all of a sudden I heard. “Babe, want to go upstairs?” I jumped so high that I hit my head on the lamp. “Woah, where did you go?” I asked while visibly annoyed. “Don’t worry about it my darling” She calmly told me.  \n  \nI did not go upstairs with her that night as I was pretty mad at her for leaving during the date night we had planned. I slept on the couch that night and I reconsidered our relationship the whole night.I kept debating with myself about whether I should stay or leave as this was deeply unsettling. It was a huge red flag,  \n  \nI had thoughts about her cheating on me but I married her so I trusted her and it was just a passing thought. \n\nThe next week a similar thing happened. We were supposed to go eat dinner at a restaurant. I had reserved a table at a very high end restaurant. I was excited because I saved a lot of money for this specific date night. As we are leaving to the restaurant she says “I need to use the bathroom, go start the car.” I do just that and around 15 minutes go by. I began to wonder, where is she? How is she taking so long? \n\nI waited another 15 minutes. Nothing. She didn’t come back so I decided to go check out what is going on and why is she taking so long.\n\nI went inside and walked upstairs to our bedroom. I thought she would be there putting on more makeup or doing some finishing touches, maybe even doing her hair over and over. I walk in and she’s not there. Only thing I see are her clothes on the floor.   \n  \nThe same clothes she was supposed to put on for our date. “Why are these on the floor?” I thought. It was bizarre that she would do this on our date night and it was not the first time either. \n\nI started to look around the house but she was nowhere to be seen. I walk in the kitchen and I hear this weird hissing sound coming from under me. The basement, why would she be there? There was nothing in there and no reason for her to go inside the basement.  \n  \nI walked the stairs to the basement and it was dark. It also smelled really funky. It was very warm and humid there. That was not the case earlier.  Then I hear some movement behind me and look over there. It’s dark but I have a flashlight so I turn it on. ‘’hisssss’’ It hissed at me. The half snake half woman hissed at me.‘’What the fuck!’’ I yelled at the monster who turned out to be my wife. The puzzle just clicked and that’s where she always disappeared to.  \n  \n‘’Don’t look at me’’ She said with this raspy, snake-like voice.  \n  \n‘’How could you hide this from me?’’ I asked while getting angry at her for hiding this.  \n  \n‘’I thought you would leave me if you knew,’’ She told me.   \n  \n‘’Is there a way out of this? Is this a curse?’’ I wanted to figure out how this was even possible.   \n  \n‘’It’s a curse that can’t be lifted,’’ she answered. ‘’ I can’t be saved. Please kill me and stop this madness’’ Rosanne said while starting to weep.   \n  \nI thought about it for a while. She returned to human form and we talked this through. She did not want to live anymore because every time she turned into a snake. She got this hunger for human souls and she told me she prefers to feast on younger people as their souls are more pure than grown humans. I had to think about the situation and what could be done.  \n  \nEvery night I had these nightmares of her stealing children and feasting on their souls. It was terrifying to think about. I kept going back and forth between killing her and helping her.   \n  \nYou are thinking ‘’Why would he help her?’’ I know it sounds bad but I got that idea because she was perfect.  \n  \nWe had a nice relationship and I never had to worry about anything after coming home from work. She kept the house clean and made me dinner. I couldn’t make my decision then and there. I needed to think it through.  \n  \nOne day we talked about the situation on our hands and she told me how and why she was cursed. She told me that when she was younger her parents were homeless and wanted to get stability in their lives.  \n  \nThey found this mysterious ad on a lamp post and it was about some shaman helping people get what they want. So her parents went to visit that shaman and they got an offer. They would get everything they ever wanted but it would cost them their first ten thousand euros. It was clear the money had to be their first ten thousand ever. They accepted but didn't know what would happen if they didn’t pay him. She told me that because they were homeless after they got the money they totally forgot that deal made with the shaman. \n\nThe shaman never told them what would happen if they would not pay him. Soon they found out. As her mother gave birth to my wife she was healthy and all was well but by the time she turned five. She would turn into this half snake half human form. Her parents did not know what to do. It was not natural and so they remembered the shaman who helped them out of poverty. As they visited the shaman he told them that it was too late to do anything and it was all their fault for not following their deal. My wife got cursed by that shaman because her parents forgot to pay him.   \n  \nHearing this made me want to help her even more. She did not cause this and deserved a good life. A good life that was ruined by her parents' actions. One day, exactly 5 days after what happened I was walking on the street and I saw this poster of a shaman offering spiritual readings. I got an idea and went to visit that shaman as soon as I could. I located his cottage which was a little hard to find but I managed to find it. I knocked on the door. He opened the door and he looked old, really old. He looked like he was over 90 years old.\n\nI then asked him about the situation and he told me that he was the shaman who helped those homeless people. He also told me the same story my wife did and that gave me a little  bit of hope.  \n  \nHe spoke very calmly and was not one bit angry.  \n  \nHe told me that there could be a cure but he had to check from some book, so I waited.   \n  \n30 minutes go by and he comes back. I can feel that the thing he found is not good. ‘’There is no cure or any way to reverse this,’’ He told me. He also said that it was a strong curse because they had made a deal. Once the parents and the shaman both agreed her fate was set. That felt so wrong, I had so much hope in me. That was all for nothing. I still decided to stay with her and not let her die. It was not an option.  Before leaving the shaman's hut he said something weird. ‘’A person’s love is the only thing capable of removing something this horrifying’’. I didn’t answer and just left.  \n  \nI walked back home feeling pretty low. I could not get that sadness to go away. It was a 15 minute walk and I kept thinking about what would happen and how we could cure her.  \n  \nI got to the front door and opened it. The house was really quiet, no sounds at all. ‘’Rosanne’’ I shouted but no answer. I walked up to our bedroom and there she was. She was laying on the bed and there was blood all over her. I started to cry as I realized she had done what I couldn’t.   \n  \nThere was a note beside her and I read that. In that note she told me how much she loved me and how great I was. She also apologized for doing this but she could not endanger anyone anymore. She also told me that we would get married in the next life.  \n  \nI read it and with each word I cried louder. I just kept having these flashbacks of all the good things we did together. All the late night walks, dancing at our wedding, dreaming about moving to another country and all the late night laughs we had before falling asleep together.  \n  \nI lost everything that night.  I lost her, the brightest light in this world of darkness. I still have her clothes in my closet and I still can’t let go."},"29":{"title":"My Reflection Isn't Mine Anymore. It's Practicing.

Feels stupid, like proof I’m losing it, but I have to get it out somewhere that isn't just the panic loop inside my own head. Maybe someone else... knows this feeling? This specific, creeping wrongness. It’s getting worse.\n\n\n\nMoved into Apt 4B fast, three weeks ago. Bad breakup, messy, humiliating. Had to run, didn’t look close. Cheap rent, pre-war building, edge of nowhere interesting. You know the type. Thin walls – hear muffled neighbors fights like trapped ghosts. Bedroom radiator clangs: clang-clang-clang, pause, clang-clang. Always. Like Morse code for ha ha ha. Floor slopes west just enough my cheap office chair drifts to the wall unless I wedge my heavy Gardner's Art book under a wheel. Place smells… old. Dust from FDR maybe, lead paint probably explaining past tenants. And underneath that… faint, sharp, metallic tang. Like ozone or old pennies. Or old blood you tried to scrub out. Strongest near the ancient fuse box in the hall closet. Told myself it’s just old building crap. Can't complain, sound nuts.\n\n\n\nJob? Remote data entry. Stare at spreadsheets till numbers blur. Cheap instant coffee tastes like acidic dirt. Landlord did the five-minute speed-walkthrough. Talked ‘original charm’ (cracked tiles, dripping faucet). Pointedly ignored the brown water stain blooming across the bedroom ceiling like a diseased lung. Didn’t care then. Just needed anywhere else.\n\n\n\nPlace has too many reflective surfaces. Didn't register it properly at first, numb from everything. Bathroom medicine cabinet mirror, huge, half the wall, bottom corners perpetually fogged like trapped breath. Living room window faces a close brick wall, reflects the room back greasy and dim, especially revealing at night. And the bedroom… dominated by massive, floor-to-ceiling mirrored closet doors. Tarnished fake-gold trim, pure 80s tackiness. Supposed to make the room feel bigger. Just makes it feel vast and judgy. Makes you feel watched. Never alone. Always seeing yourself.\n\n\n\nFirst week, unpacking hell. Cardboard ghosts. Exhausted. Upstairs neighbor seemed to combine competitive furniture bowling with grief-stricken sobbing around 3 AM nightly. Didn't care.\n\n\n\nSecond week. Things felt… off. Not jump scares. Smaller. Weirder. Insidious, like finding mold just out of sight. Sitting on the floor, sorting books. That heavy Gardner's textbook, spine wrecked from college. Set it on the ‘keep’ pile left of me. Felt the thud. Glanced up. Living room window reflection, dim afternoon light, dirty glass acting as a murky mirror. In the reflection… clear as day… the book was still inside the cardboard box I'd just pulled it from. Cold. Stomach went ice cold. Looked down – book physically on the pile. Looked back at the reflection – correct now, showing the book exactly where it was, mocking me. Tired eyes? Old warped glass? Grabbed the excuses like lifelines. Needed them.\n\n\n\nBathroom mirror. Hung my blue towel – one frayed edge I never snip – on the hook beside the sink. Went to brush my teeth later, head down, avoiding my own gaze. Looked up quickly. My reflection looked back, but for a split second, the eyes… were they green? Mine are dark brown. Snapped back to normal instantly. Blinked hard. Imagined it? Then I saw the hook in the reflection: empty. Utterly empty. Breath hitched, loud in the small room. Reached out – physical towel right there beside me, damp terrycloth under trembling fingers. Looked back at the mirror. The reflection seemed to… shimmer? Like heat haze off asphalt? Then the blue towel just snapped into existence there, reflected perfectly. Condensation? Smudge? Brain glitching from stress, caffeine, heartbreak? Fine. Tried to ignore it. But felt that first real prickle of specific unease. Low down. Like swallowed stones.\n\n\n\nIt kept happening. Quick, unsettling flashes of wrongness, always contained within reflections. Always snapping back to normal the instant I focused, making me doubt myself relentlessly. Question my sanity. A coffee mug reflected on the kitchen counter, the one with the hairline crack I know I washed and put in the dish drainer minutes before. My reflection caught momentarily in the dark TV screen wearing the other sweatshirt, the grey hooded one still hanging on the back of the chair across the room. Tiny visual stutters. Glitches in the mirrored world that felt… deliberate. Pointed. Targeted. Like reality had typos only I could see, designed specifically to make me unravel.\n\n\n\nTried taking photos. Obsessively. Useless. Point my phone, reflections look subtly, undeniably wrong. Click the shutter. Check the photo. Perfectly normal mirror image. Every. Damn. Time. Holding the phone, looking at the digital picture that proves I’m not seeing what I’m seeing… it’s a specific, insidious, perfectly executed form of psychological torture. Makes me want to smash the phone, smash every reflective surface in this goddamn apartment until there’s nothing left to lie to me.\n\n\n\nTried calling Maya again. Tried to sound casual, joking about weird light, needing glasses, ha ha. \"Maybe cut back on the coffee?\" she suggested, voice laced with that careful kindness that telegraphs I think you're cracking up. \"Get some sleep, Sarah, okay?\" Didn't push it. Hearing my own shaky voice trying to rationalize reflections being actively wrong… sounded completely unhinged even to me. Hung up feeling the isolation clamp down harder, thicker. Breakup left a hollow space; this creeping wrongness was filling it with cold dread.\n\n\n\nThen it wasn't just momentary glitches anymore. A few nights ago. Sitting hunched on the second-hand couch (smells faintly of stale cigarettes and cat), rain hammering the windows, turning them into dark, slick mirrors reflecting the single lamp. Scrolling numbly through depressing news on my phone. That prickling feeling on my neck intensified – the stare. Not just a feeling this time. A heavy, physical certainty. Looked up slowly, deliberately, heart beginning its frantic drumbeat, at the living room window reflection. My own head and shoulders reflected back. Behind me, the reflection showed the bedroom door. Closed. Firmly shut, a solid, pale slab of wood in the murky reflection, looking unnaturally flat and final.\n\n\n\nExcept… I froze. Breath caught hard, painfully. I never close the bedroom door. Live alone. Makes the tiny apartment feel like a shoebox closing in. Suffocating. I always leave it open.\n\n\n\nHeart started that sick, heavy pounding against my ribs, panicked bird trapped inside. Didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stared at the reflection, eyes wide. Closed door. Stayed that way. Five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. Long enough for the absolute, concrete impossibility to sink in, cold and sharp as glass under a fingernail. Slowly, fighting the tremor that started violently in my hands, I turned my head just enough. Looked over my shoulder at the actual bedroom doorway.\n\n\n\nWide open. A dark, yawning rectangle leading into the unlit room. Exactly as it should be.\n\n\n\nWhipped my head back to the window. The reflection instantly corrected itself. Open door. Matching reality.\n\n\n\nBut I saw it. It wasn't a flicker. It wasn't my brain misfiring. It was wrong, objectively, demonstrably wrong, and it stayed wrong until I looked away. Like it was waiting. Like it was flexing a muscle. Or testing the flimsy barrier between my reality and its… distorted, increasingly bold echo.\n\n\n\nLast night. Couldn't sleep. Predictably. The 3 AM radiator clang (three, pause, two) felt like hammer blows against my skull. Felt wired, raw, skin crawling. Every settling creak sounded deliberate, like footsteps. Kept glancing towards the bedroom door, shut tight now (by me, useless lock checked three times), thinking about those huge, dark closet mirrors lurking inside like predators. Finally dragged myself up for water around 2 AM, throat painfully dry, mouth tasting like old pennies, heart fluttering wild.\n\n\n\nWalked back down the short, dim hallway towards the couch, the only place feeling marginally less hostile. Had to pass the full-length hallway mirror near the bathroom. Tried to avoid looking. Watched my feet on the worn carpet runner, counting faded roses. But caught movement – or rather, a profound, shocking lack of movement – in my peripheral vision. Froze mid-step, muscles locking painfully. Forced myself to turn slowly, neck cracking, stiff with dread. Looked.\n\n\n\nStared into the hallway mirror. My reflection stared back. Looked… normal at first glance. Same worn grey pyjamas, same sleep-deprived eyes shadowed purple. But something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong. Took a sickening second for my oxygen-starved brain to register. My own chest was visibly rising and falling, breath coming in short, panicked gasps that were loud, wet, obscene in the utter silence. The reflection’s chest was perfectly still. Utterly, unnervingly motionless. It wasn’t breathing.\n\n\n\nWe stood there for what felt like an hour, probably only ten agonizing seconds. Me, gasping, dizzy, vision tunnelling. It, perfectly still, wearing my face like a freshly borrowed, poorly fitting, suffocating mask, not breathing.\n\n\n\nThen, its head tilted. A slow, deliberate, inquisitive movement that didn’t match any muscle twitch I made, smooth yet somehow disjointed. Its eyes – my eyes, but suddenly vacant, glassy, like cheap doll's eyes reflecting dim light without depth or life – seemed to focus directly on me with a dawning, profoundly alien intelligence. Calculating. Assessing. Curious.\n\n\n\nIts lips parted slightly. Not a smile. Something worse. As if testing the mechanics of a mouth. A faint, wet clicking sound seemed to emanate not from the reflection's mouth, but from the surface of the glass itself, sharp and distinct. Click… click-click… Like saliva snapping between teeth that weren't quite real, or insect mandibles rubbing together.\n\n\n\nThat broke the paralysis. A strangled sob tore out, raw and ugly. I spun away, scrabbling blindly at the living room doorway like a trapped animal, stumbling onto the couch, burying my face deep into the musty cushions, muffling my own whimpering gasps. Didn’t look back. Couldn't.\n\n\n\nSat there, shaking uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat that chilled me to the bone, until the grey, indifferent light of dawn filtered through the dirty windows. Didn't hear anything else. But I felt it. The stillness behind me. The focused, calculating awareness emanating from that hallway mirror, even hours later, even facing away.\n\n\n\nIt’s not just glitches anymore. It’s not just watching. It’s animating. Demonstrating independent movement. Making sounds. It’s… practicing? Testing its borrowed form? Learning the basic mechanisms of life it observes, like breathing?\n\n\n\nThe reflection in my dark phone screen looks normal now. Tired. Scared. Haunted. Shattered. But the eyes… are they my eyes looking out? Or just holes reflecting dim light back at me? When I look away, do they keep watching? Do they blink when I don't? Do they practice expressions in the dark?\n\n\n\nI don’t know what this thing is. But it’s here. And it’s learning my face. And I think it's learning faster now. Much faster."},"30":{"title":"I was born without a shadow.

And you can clearly see it:\n\nEveryone else in the room casts a shadow.\n\nI don’t.\n\nIt’s not subtle. It’s not a trick of the light.

Its towers sagged outward like broken limbs. Its windows stared blankly, like wounded eyes stitched up with boards.\n\nAnd at its heart, rising higher than the roof itself, grew the Wither Tree, its bark bleached bone-white against the bleeding sky.\n\nI had never seen the House from outside.\n\nAnd now, it had seen me.\n\nThe Ma'am's fingers clamped around my wrist, cold as iron.\n\nWithout a word, she dragged me forward, across the cracked stone path, past thorn-choked gardens.\n\nToward the trees.\n\nToward the waiting maw of the Thousand Acre Wood.\n\n“Can I at least bring a lantern?” I pleaded. \n\n“Course you can’t,” she said, wrenching me into the trees. “You’d just drop it when you died and burn the whole wood down, wouldn’t you?”\n\nThe deeper we went, the more the sunset faded. The forest swallowed the glow in greedy gulps. Branches knotted above like clenched fingers while roots snarled beneath the path like coiled rope. The air turned thick. \n\nI swear I heard laughter. High, bright. Childlike. \n\nOnly it was wrong. Sanded down to a raw edge. Like the joy had been boiled off, leaving only the sound of teeth behind.\n\nSoon, it was only the Ma’am’s lantern lighting the way, flickering dimly like it knew it didn’t belong out here.\n\n“How deep are we going?” I whispered.\n\n“Deep enough that you’ll never find your way out,” she said.\n\nA sound cracked the air. A snarl. Then a low, wet whine.\n\nSomething moved in the trees. I whipped my head around, caught glimpses of it. Shapes in the dark. Snouts. Jaws. Bones.\n\n“I think a Hungry Thing’s following us,” I stammered.\n\nThe Ma’am smiled, slow and dark. “Oh yes. There’s more than one. A whole family is out there—your family. Your miserable brothers and sisters, other disobedient brats devoured by the wood.”\n\nMy chest ached. So that’s what Gran had meant when she told the Ma’am I wasn’t another of her monsters. Deep down, she knew I wasn’t a boy. That I wasn’t even a story. That I was just another Hungry Thing wearing a mask.  \n\nThe branches groaned above us, and from the shadows, something stepped out.\n\nIt was tall. Slouched. Furred.\n\nIts body was stretched like melted wax. Limbs too thin. Spine too bent. A pig snout jutted from its face, twitching with each breath. But its teeth… they weren’t right. Long. Curved. Sharp as keys.\n\nAnd its eyes—God, its eyes. Not two. Not human. A cluster of them. A whole web. All of them blinking at once, like spider hatchlings.\n\nI stumbled backward.\n\nThe Ma’am’s hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of my hair. Held me in place.\n\n“Not another step,” she said softly. “Not unless you want it to gobble you up.”\n\nThe creature loomed closer. Bones crackled in its limbs with each movement, like someone reassembling it wrong with every step. Its snout sniffed. It crouched low.\n\nAnd then it spoke.\n\nThe voice was wrong. It sounded like a little girl who’d been dragged face-first through gravel.\n\nIt sounded like… \n\n“Gretchin?” I whimpered, horror seizing my lungs. \n\nThe Ma’am knelt beside me. Her arm draped across my shoulders, light as silk and cold as a blade. “You recognize your sister, do you, Boy? Good. This is what failed drafts become after they’re devoured by the wood. It’s what you’ll become.”\n\nShe leaned in. Whispered in my ear. \n\n“Do you know what it sounded like? Listening to your older sister get chewed alive by these very trees?” She smiled. Not smug but fond, like she was remembering an old family recipe. “It sounded wet. Noisy. Perfect.”\n\nI slammed my eyes shut.\n\nI couldn’t look. Couldn’t breathe.\n\nGretchin sighed. “Ma’am not bring… Food…”\n\nThen, with a final snap of twisting bone, my older sister straightened. Her snout turned toward the dark. Sniffed. And just like that, she was gone. Swallowed by the forest again.\n\nI collapsed to my knees. “Please…” I begged, clutching the hem of her dress. “Please don’t leave me here. I promise I’ll be good. I’ll be good.”\n\nShe looked down at me with mock surprise. Then crouched. Cupped my cheek.\n\n“Yes,” she said gently. “You had better.”\n\nHer thumb traced the spot where she’d struck me earlier. “Because I’m a kind woman, I’ll give you one more chance. That’s it. Break another rule… and I’ll feed you to your sister. Am I clear?”\n\nI nodded so fast it hurt.\n\nShe turned. “Then come.”\n\nI followed, and the forest watched us. I could feel it. Every branch an eyelid. Every shadow a snare.\n\n“Why did Gretchin turn into that?” I asked. The question fell out of me before I could stop it.\n\nTo my surprise, the Ma’am didn’t look angry. She looked… pleased. “Because I gave the girl hunger, then let her starve. That’s the trick, Boy.”\n\nShe twirled as she walked, like a child in a summer field. Her dress flared around her like black petals. “Monsters born from want never stop chewing.”\n\nShe glanced back at me, grin widening. “This whole wood is full of my monsters. And just like I did to them, I can end your story any time I please. *Remember that.*”\n\nBy the time we reached the Crooked House, the sun had fled.\n\nThe sky bled purple and black as the silhouette of that shambling monstrosity rose before us. It loomed like a gravestone. Jagged, enormous. An omen of death. \n\nThe Ma’am said nothing. Just unlatched the door, pushed me inside, and locked it behind us.\n\nThere was no supper. No voice. No mercy.\n\nShe shoved me down the hall and into my room. It was a closet in everything but name.\n\nPeeling wallpaper.\n\nMold on the ceiling.\n\nA rotted mattress that oozed when I sat on it.\n\nA single slot window sat near the ceiling, boarded tight. I used to think it was to keep me in. Now I knew better.\n\nIt was to keep them out.\n\nThe door locked behind me with a sound like finality.\n\nClick. Clack. Slide.\n\nAnd then I was alone. Alone with the dark.\n\nI curled into a ball, wrapping the moth-eaten blanket around myself like a bandage. The room smelled like mildew and fear. Outside, I heard the woods whisper.\n\nThe Hungry Things hadn’t gone far.\n\nTheir sounds rose through the night: snorts, snarls, bones cracking in the trees. Sometimes laughter. Sometimes chewing. Always near. Always waiting.\n\nAnd Gretchen… \n\nThe thought of my older sister broke my heart. I curled up, cried. Quietly. Not sobbing—just the kind of crying where the body leaks and trembles.\n\nI didn’t want the Ma’am to hear.\n\nI didn’t want her to remember I even existed.\n\nI must’ve drifted off because at some point later the lock clicked. \n\nMy body tensed.\n\nThe hinges creaked. The door whined open. Then came footsteps. Slow. Uneven.\n\nThe floorboard groaned beside my bed.\n\nI clenched my eyes shut. Held still. The Ma’am. Had she changed her mind—decided to drag me back into the Thousand Acre Woods after all?\n\nMaybe if I looked asleep she’d go away.\n\nMaybe she’d think I’d learned my lesson.\n\nThen—hands in my hair. But they were gentle. Fingers ran through my tangled curls, soft and shaky. A touch full of care. Lips pressed to my scalp. A kiss. Featherlight.\n\nNot the Ma’am. Couldn’t be. \n\nA woman’s voice rasped. Worn, weak—but unmistakable. “Happy birthday, Levi.”\n\nCarol…\n\nThe words broke me. I didn’t move. I couldn’t. The door creaked closed again, and when I rolled over, something waited on the floor beside my mattress.\n\nA teddy bear.\n\nHand-sewn. Lopsided. Beautiful.\n\nIts button eyes caught the moonlight bleeding through the boards. It looked like it had been stitched together from old blankets and worn-out clothes. Like love had held it together more than thread. I pulled it to my chest and held it tight.\n\nIt didn’t feel like fabric. It felt like armor.\n\nLike safety.\n\nLike someone still saw me as something worth saving. And for the first time I could remember, I fell asleep not as a brat or a monster or a failed draft. But as Levi. \n\nA boy who was loved. \n\n# _______________________________\n\nThe memory burned away, taking with it the love, the warmth, the teddy bear. \n\nGiving me madness in return. \n\nFractured worlds spun around me—shards of shattered dimensions tumbling through a black void. Portals clawed at my skin, my bones, my name, each one a gaping maw desperate to rewrite me into something else. I wasn't falling through space, I was being yanked apart by stories, each one howling to claim me.\n\nThen *crack*.\n\nA bang\n\nA *Big Bang*. \n\nThe portals collapsed inward. The fractured planets folded like dying lungs. And I dropped, headfirst through a gullet of time and ink, falling into a universe reborn.\n\nI blinked. Above me stretched a red-brick alley that reached impossibly high, its walls touching a sky smeared with midnight and madness. Lightning tore across it, but the thunder that followed didn’t rumble—it screamed.\n\n“It is done.”\n\nThe voice buzzed like a hive, layered and insectile, vibrating. Where, I couldn't properly place.\n\n“Yes,” answered a second, similarly implacable voice. “It would seem the Shuffle proved successful.”\n\nIt spoke slower, words slurred through reversed syllables, like poetry played backward on broken vinyl. I’d heard it before, once, in the tunnels beneath the Sub-Vaults, when the Jack of Clubs had taken me past the Spades. I hadn’t understood it then.\n\nNow I could.\n\nWhy?\n\nSirens bled into the air, pulsing like a failing heartbeat: **“WARNING. WARNING. MASS-CONTAINMENT BREACH.”**\n\nShit.\n\nNot good.\n\n“The False Dealer has lost command of the Deck,” buzzed the first voice. \n\n“By the grace of Mother, our authority returns.”\n\nAdrenaline yanked me upright. My breath tore in and out like a blade. The Shuffle. The Hearts had done it then. They’d fed me to the storm. They’d used me—the second Joker—to collapse the Deck. \n\n**“ALL PERSONNEL ARE TO INITIATE LOCKDOWN PROTOCOLS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”**\n\nThe storm above cracked again, and somewhere deep inside, I felt something unravel. Like a knot I hadn’t known was keeping me alive had just been cut.\n\nIf there was a mass containment breach, that meant a bloodbath. Conscripts would be spilling down these halls soon enough, which meant I needed to—\n\nSomething stepped out from behind me.\n\nAn Overseer, but not like any I’d seen before. No porcelain. No mournful eyes. Just a chitinous carapace, mirrored and gleaming, with insectile mandibles that clicked with thought. Translucent wings draped from its back like a funeral shroud.\n\n“The Joker stirs,” it buzzed.\n\nIts chest bore a card: 5 of Diamonds. Its chakram gleamed like a spinning sawblade, holstered across its spine. Diamonds were record keepers. Redactors. The kind of Overseer that decided whether corrupted narratives—urban legends, creepy pastas and the like—were archived, rewritten as Conscripts, or erased outright. Diamonds edited reality with surgical violence.\n\nFootsteps echoed behind it. Heavier. Human-shaped. Almost. If humans were eight feet tall. \n\nA second figure emerged, draped in funeral-black armor so sleek it might have been lacquered in ink. An angular helm obscured its face, but the spade-headed spear in its grip was unmistakable. A vivisection tool masquerading as a weapon.\n\nThe card on its breastplate read: 10 of Spades. The most powerful rank the Deck contained. At least, outside of the Jack. \n\nIt stepped forward with solemn grace and knelt before me, like a priest preparing last rites. “The Joker’s purpose has been achieved,” it intoned, the words twisted like metal. “The Deck has been fractured. Our kin are now free of the False Dealers’ control.”\n\n“Recommended action?” buzzed the 5.\n\nThe 10 of Spades tilted its head. “Purge the variant. Prevent further disruption.”\n\nAnd just like that, I was prey again.\n\nI shot down the corridor.\n\nNo plan. No map. Just pure, terrified momentum. My boots slapped against wet metal. Lightning split the sky above. The alley buckled and stretched like it couldn’t decide which story it belonged to.\n\nBehind me came the soft buzz of wings. The 5 of Diamonds rose like a hornet from hell, chakram hissing free from its back. It zipped ahead, dropping from the sky to block my path.\n\nI skidded to a halt.\n\n“Remain still,” it chittered, raising its blade. “Your purging will be cleaner.”\n\nA voice, syrup-thick, drifted from the alley’s shadows: “Yoo-hoo.”\n\nThe 5 stiffened.\n\nOut of the gloom came something older than nightmares. Mister Neither stepped into the half-light like a wraith wearing a skin suit. His coat dragged behind him in tatters, stitched together with scraps of flesh that didn’t belong to him. In one hand, he held a bouquet of blood-slick pocket-watches—the kind issued only to Inquisitors. A trophy collection.\n\nHe’d been busy.\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds froze. Buzzed. “Variant identified: Joker.”\n\nThe 10 of Spades advanced. “Then we have acquired the Pair. Finish purging the first. I will handle the second.”\n\nMister Neither giggled. His head tilted just a little too far. “Oh no, no, no, no. I’m not the copycat. I’m the original.”\n\nThe laugh twisted into a snarl.\n\n“And that’s my toy you’re playing with.”\n\nHe charged on all fours, an animal out for blood. \n\nNo preamble. No wind-up. Just motion. A blur of fur, claws, and teeth. The 10 swung its spear to intercept, but Mister Neither collided with it mid-strike, knocking the Overseer off-balance. A claw raked across the 10’s helm, peeling back the armored plating like fruit skin. Beneath, flesh pulsed, wet and unfinished.\n\nThe 10 retaliated with mechanical precision. It drove an elbow into Mister Neither’s temple. The Hatter reeled. The spear came up again and slammed into his jaw with a bone-rattling crunch.\n\nBehind me, the chakram sang through the air.\n\nI threw myself sideways just in time. The spinning blade carved a molten line through the sewer grating beside me. The 5 of Diamonds landed, wings humming, already preparing the next strike.\n\nI dodged again, lunging to my feet.\n\nAn idea bloomed mid-sprint. Stupid, desperate, maybe fatal. But if I could pull the 5 into the fight… maybe Mister Neither wouldn’t be the only one bleeding. It might give me time to escape. \n\nYes! That could—\n\nMy excitement deflated into shock. The fight was already over. \n\nThe 10 of Spades loomed above Mister Neither, spear raised for the kill. \n\n“Farewell, Brother.”\n\nMister Neither lay sprawled, jaw cracked and bloodied. For the first time, he looked hurt. Then he smiled.\n\n“You took the words right outta my mouth.”\n\nThe spear came down.\n\nSo did the facade.\n\nIn one brutal movement, Mister Neither snapped the spear’s tip in half and drove it into the 10’s fractured helm. Ink geysered from the wound. The 10 staggered, armor failing, knees buckling.\n\nMister Neither buried his hand in its chest. “I do so love my plot twists.” He fished through pulsing organs like he was searching for spare change.\n\nThen he found it.\n\nHe wrenched free something slick and glowing. “Speaking of,” he murmured, lifting it like a trader  appraising a vintage. “I believe I've found your Plot Device.”\n\nBehind me, the wings stopped.\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds hovered midair, paralyzed. It had just witnessed something unthinkable: the murder of a 10. An elite rank. A pillar of the Deck. And now—\n\nMister Neither bit into the heart.\n\nThe 10 of Spades let out a sound halfway between a scream and a prayer. Then it exploded. A wave of ink and ruin rolled outward, rattling the alley, blotting the sky.\n\nMister Neither licked the residue from his claws. Only they'd changed. Obsidian armor rippled across them now, their tips forming jagged spades. \n\nHis eyes—twin beams behind the tophat’s veil—found the 5 of Diamonds, and a new light flickered into existence, burning through the fabric like a third eye.\n\n“Getting the picture, Brother?” he asked, voice bright with madness. “I’m going to eat the Deck. One of every suit. I’m going to become exactly what that stupid girl dreamed of turning into.”\n\n“You’ll never become the Ace,” hissed the 5. “You’re a broken narrative. A torn card. You’ll be purged before—”\n\nA spear bloomed through its chest.\n\nThe Spade’s.\n\nMister Neither had called it back like a loyal hound.\n\nIt ripped through the 5’s thorax. Glowed with stolen power. Then retracted just as fast—dragging with it another twitching Plot Device. He plucked it from the blade like meat off a skewer and swallowed it whole.\n\nThe third eye pulsed brighter. A chakram erupted from his back like a diamond buzzsaw. He staggered forward, hunched, no longer able to properly stand upright, a manic grin on his face. \n\nHe exhaled.\n\n“Delicious.”\n\nThen turned to me. “Two suits down. Two to go.”\n\nHe wasn’t just growing stronger. He was becoming coherent. That was the scariest part—that he wasn’t nonsense anymore. That he had a plan. A purpose. \n\nA climax.\n\n“Now then,” Mister Neither whispered, voice slick with anticipation. “Where were we?”\n\nHe snapped his fingers.\n\nReality blinked.\n\nThe storm-wracked alley was gone.\n\nIn its place: the circular chamber I knew too well. Pale stone walls. A single metal table. And upon it, like a wound that never closed, sat the rusted typewriter.\n\nWe were back.\n\nChamber 13.\n\nOnly now, it was different.\n\nThe ceiling gaped open, revealing the familiar moon beyond—but no longer round and laughing. Its eyes were now hollowed craters. Black ichor dripped from its bisected smile, spilling down onto the keys of the machine like cosmic blood. The typewriter twitched with every drop, shuddering.\n\nI backed away from it.\n\nFrom him.\n\n“Why are you doing all of this?” I demanded. My voice came out smaller than I meant. Frail. The voice of a boy. \n\nMister Neither crouched beside me, bloodied pocket-watches jingling at his waist. “Cause I wanna fix my ending,” he said simply. “And the key to making this stupid machine work…”\n\nHis claw tapped my temple. Once. Twice. Harder the third time.\n\n“Is buried in there.”\n\nRealization struck like a thunderclap.\n\nThe Ma’am.\n\nThe Wither Tree. The typewriter. The stories she carved from pain. From me. From Gretchen. From Carol and the Woodsman and every broken child she fed to the Crooked House.\n\n“You want to know how she did it,” I whispered, heart folding in on itself. “You want to know how she used the typewriter. To write. To create.”\n\nHis grin widened.\n\n“It was never me you wanted,” I croaked. “Just my worst memories.”\n\nMister Neither’s fingers closed around my skull, vice-like and tender at once. His strobing eyes pulsed like dying stars. “Wrong again,” he whispered. “Those weren’t your worst memories.”\n\nHis thumbs dug deeper. “Just the worst so far.”\n\nThen: *snap*.\n\nNot bone. Not sound.\n\nBut the world.\n\nIt cracked.\n\nFractured like a spine caught in the middle of a laugh. Everything fell away, stone, typewriter, and sky. I was pulled backward, screaming, through a door I’d locked long ago. Into a memory I’d buried in shadow. Into the moment she showed me the cost of creation.\n\nThe price of making a story real.\n\nThe moment the Ma’am taught me what it meant to bleed on the page.\n\nThe Ma’am’s voice reached through the light like a dagger through silk. *“Carol gave you a birthday gift, did she, Boy? Well, it’s only proper I give you one too.”*\n\nNot this.\n\nI fought the memory. Clawed at the vision, pushed back with everything I had.\n\nHer voice sharpened, closer now, like nails on glass. “*I always told you you’d die a violent death, you ungrateful little swine. Let me show you what I meant.”*\n\n**NO!**\n\nThe scream ripped from my throat. The light shattered. I dangled in the Hatter’s grip—sweating, heaving, wild-eyed.\n\nHe stared at me, expression twisted with a snarl. “What... did you just *do*?” \n\nI didn’t know. \n\nSomething inside me had pulsed. Like a thread pulled taut. Like a key turning in a lock I didn’t know I had. I’d resisted the Hatter’s magic.\n\nThe Joker card burned in my pocket, softly thrumming against my leg. \n\nDid it have something to do with it?\n\nWas I more powerful than I realized?\n\nThe Hatter clamped both over-sized claws around my skull. His breath hit my cheek in gusts that smelled like old paper soaked in rot. “You’re stubborn. But you’ll break. *Everything breaks*.”\n\nAnd then came the pain.\n\n[MORE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCryptid\/comments\/jba8ww\/story_master_list\/)"},"32":{"title":"Scarecrows don't move","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfstjz\/scarecrows_dont_move\/","flair":null,"author":"Ethanol3310","selftext":"People like to romanticise farm life. They picture sunsets and fresh cow’s milk, dusty picturesque fields and singing all day to cheerful work. But that’s not the kind of story this is.  \n   \nThis is the story of a scarecrow that was *watching me.*  \n   \nIt began on an evening like any other, one of those nights where the silence felt too thick, like the land itself was holding its breath.  \n   \nI was aching from chores, my clothes damp with sweat and dirt, my brain fried from the heat and the usual arguments with Mum about homework. I slumped into a chair by the kitchen window with a plate of reheated stew and glanced outside.  \n   \nThat’s when I saw it.  \n   \nThe scarecrow.  \n   \nIt had always stood out in the lower field, crooked and slouched like it had given up scaring birds. But now, I swear its arm had moved.  \n   \nJust barely. A twitch. A tilt. Then slowly and unnaturally, the limb stretched sideways revealing a rusted scythe clenched in its other hand.  \n   \nI stared, transfixed on it.  \n   \nThe thing wasn’t blowing in the wind because there was no wind. It was dead still outside, the kind of stillness that makes animals stop in their tracks and listen.  \n   \nIts head turned.  \nNot swung, *turned*.  \n   \nIntentionally, like a man adjusting his neck after a long sleep.  \n   \nIts stitched grin pulled wider as its burlap face tightened and for a moment, I felt it looking straight through the glass and into me.  \nThat terrifying sneer… I’d somehow seen it before.  \n   \nMy breathing stopped and a pressure built in my chest while a scream started forming just under my ribs.  \n   \nI blinked  \nand when I opened my eyes…  \n   \nIt was back to normal.  \nIt was just a regular scarecrow on the pole again.  \nSagging… quiet… *pretending*.  \n   \nI forced myself to eat, trying to shake off the feeling. But even in my room behind closed doors, I couldn’t stop checking the window. I told myself it was my imagination.  \nStress. Hunger. Fatigue.  \n   \nBut deep down, I didn’t believe it.  \nIt felt too real to be my mind playing tricks on me.  \n   \nThe rain came later, slow and steady. It smeared the glass and turned the outside world into a distorted abstract painting. Perhalps a Pollock piece.  \n   \nThe trees swayed in the distance, branches contorting in the wind. The calves were bawling from the barn, anxious and loud like they could sense something was out of place.  \nLike they knew someone was out there with them.  \n   \nAnd then while gazing into the distance, something obscured my vision  \n   \nA silhouette.  \n   \nNot on the pole.  \n   \n**At my window.**  \n   \nThe scarecrow stood there, face pressed nearly flat against the pane, just inches from mine.  \n   \nIt didn’t tap.  \nIt didn’t scratch.  \nIt just stared; a blank, motionless stare.  \n   \nIts lips curled in what could only be described as eagerness to be let in.  \n   \nI fell backwards, slamming my head into the wooden floor. The room spun like a grand carousel.  \nWhen I managed to scramble back to my feet, I gasped  \n   \nThere was nothing there.  \n   \nThe rain still fell but the window was almost dry.  \nIn the reflection, I could see my own face and behind it, for a split second, a flash of black buttons where eyes shouldn’t be.  \n   \nI checked on Mum and she was in the lounge, her face wet with tears.  \n   \n“The paper never came,” she said, trying to sound brave, but her voice cracked.  \n   \nShe wasn’t waiting for news about crops or the weather.  \n   \nShe was waiting for word about him.  \n   \n**My father.**  \n   \nHe’d gone to prison after what he did to her.  \nUnspeakable and depraved atrocities that deserve the death penalty.  \n   \nI used to lie awake at night imagining him getting what he deserved in prison.  \nBut now… I wasn't so sure.  \n   \n“He’s not coming back,” I told her. “You know that.”  \n   \nEven though I had lost confidence, I had to be strong for her.  \nI had to protect her.  \nSomething in the dark was stirring.  \nGetting closer every passing second.  \n   \nBy morning, the rain had stopped, but the sky still looked bruised.  \n   \nI walked out to the field, legs trembling, unsure if it was anger or fear holding me together.  \n   \nThe scarecrow waited.  \n   \nI stopped a few metres away, staring into that blank, burlap face, mustering up every bit of confidence I had.  \nIt had dried blood on the fabric.  \nOld, sickly brown, crusted deep into the weave.  \n   \n“You’re not real,” I whispered.  \n   \nI stepped forward.  \nSeized it by the neck.  \n   \n“Move again, you brainless fuck,” I taunted. “Do it!”  \n   \n**It moved.**  \n   \nNot suddenly. Not with force.  \nJust with certainty.  \n   \nIts arms lifted, slow, but solid.  \n   \nThe illusion of straw faded.  \nBeneath its sleeves human skin emerged.  \nNot normal skin.  \nSkin charred and warped, blackened like meat left on an open flame too long.  \n   \nFingernails melted to the flesh.  \nSnapped bones protruded from split sinew.  \n   \nIt grabbed my wrists with a strength that didn’t belong to an inanimate sack of hay and I couldn’t pull away.  \n   \nIts face began to peel.  \n   \nThe sackcloth unravelled, thread by thread, as if it was been shut to hide the unspeakable horrors that lay beneath.  \n   \nIt was a man’s face.  \nOr what was left of one.  \n   \nThe skin hung in patches, lips fused into a permanent sneer. One eye was gone and in the socket was just a black hole like an endless abyss of depravity.  \n   \nThe other eye, still attached and very human, burned with recognition and malevolence.  \n   \n“Thomas,” it rasped.  \nA voice like a dying and feral animal, wheezing through collapsing lungs.  \n“You look just like her.”  \n   \nThe hat blew off, revealing his skull, bare black veins still pulsing faintly across scorched tissue.  \n   \nHe raised the scythe  \nand I didn’t have time to scream before it came down.  \n   \nMetal sank into my shoulder with a wet, crackling crunch.  \n   \nPain swallowed me whole.  \n   \nI felt the blade split through skin, muscle, bone.  \n   \nMy blood poured into the dirt like a cascade.  \nI screamed and squirmed until somehow, through blind panic and raw survival instinct, I managed to break free.  \n   \nI ran like the wind and didn’t look back.  \nI couldn’t even if I wanted to.  \n   \nI bolted to the house, crimson blood dripping with every swift step.  \nI slammed the door behind me, my shoulder burning like it was on fire.  \n   \n“Mum!” I cried.  \n   \nShe turned, pallid as if her soul had been sucked out.  \n   \n“The paper came,” she stated weakly. Her hands trembled.  \n“There was a fire at the prison.”  \n   \nMy mouth was too dry to speak as if my vocal cords had been ripped out.  \nI nodded breathlessly in reply.  \n   \n“It happened two months ago,” she whispered.  \n“They don’t know who survived and more importantly, haven’t found any of the escaped inmates.”  \n   \nMy legs went weak.  \n   \n“Was he on the list of deceased?” I inquired, the fear pervading within my voice.  \n   \nShe didn’t answer  \nbut I already knew.  \n   \n“I think he’s already here,” I whispered.  \n   \nOut there in the fields…  \n   \n*Waiting.*  \n   \nWe both turned to the window in unison.  \n   \nThe scarecrow was *gone.*"},"33":{"title":"I'm A Fire Tower Watchman In Appalachia.

Fires in the area have been keeping me pretty busy so its been a second since Ive been back to the tower. I usually wouldn't come down from the tower but the fires are extremely close and its all hands on deck. We finally stopped the main fire so I have some time to myself. Thanks to all of you out there for messaging me on my last post. A lot of good ideas for me this time around. \n\nIve been gone for about seventeen days now on fire duty. I camped with a crew of three others, Moe, Jc, and Miranda. It was about night six when strange things started to happen. Jc woke up in a cold sweat screaming at the top of his lungs \"IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY\" over and over again until Moe could shake him out of it. It shook us up pretty bad as well but that was just the beginning. The next night it happened again but Jc wasn't in his tent this time. His screaming was coming Forty feet away in the woods now. The same horrible thing he was screaming last night. When we found him he was weeping into his hands begging us not to let the man take him. We looked at each other and goosebumps formed on my body. When we snapped him out of it he had no recollection of what just happened in fact he asked us what was going on when he finally looked at us.\n\nThe next morning we called In for medical to come get Jc out of there for his own good. We weren't sure what was going on but he was in no state to keep watch with us. Nothing for three days and then Moe started to act funny. I woke up to take a piss and noticed Moe's tent was open. I looked around and seen no trace of him. I called out with reluctance not knowing what I was calling out to in the dark exactly. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to hear anything but it was silent as a library. There were no sounds whatsoever. No crickets, no owls, no nothing, and out here that's not a good sign. I zipped up my pants and turned back to my tent. I turned around and noticed Moe standing in front of his tent with his head down. \"Moe\" I called out but no reply. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. When he turned towards me his face looked different. Eyes white, face stretch and mouth agape.  I stepped backwards in terror and fell onto my butt.\n\nI jumped to my feet and looked back at Moe. His face was completely normal and now he just had a look of confusion on his face. \"What are you doing\" He asked. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, he had just got up to go to the bathroom like I had. I didn't mention his face to anyone. I just chalked it up to late night hallucinations. I went back to my tent and laid around for an hour or so with that face stuck in my head. Over the next few days there was a shift in the teams mood. Over the course of these fifteen days we went from happy, helpful, and kind to standoffish, mean, and rude. Not to mention no one wanted anything to do with one another. I could almost feel something dark clawing at me from the woods. The feeling of a weight on my chest and the cold damp feeling in the air made it very clear to me that whatever it was probably visited me at my lookout that night. I put the feeling behind me and we got to work. \n\nOn the morning of the sixteenth day things really hit the fan. I got a call on the Sat phone from the Fire Captain that a family of 3 had gone missing and the camp was torn apart a few miles from us. I asked what they thought it was and he replied \"We have no idea but just to keep an eye out for anyone.\" At about 8 A.M I woke up to Moe and Miranda fighting about which direction we should go to place the next marker. I told them about the missing family but they continued to fight. It got so bad I had to get between them. I got everyone to calm down and we started to head back to the meet up to get picked up. No one said a single word the entire 6 mile walk to the spot. Thankfully our ride was there waiting for us and everything was starting to feel better. I got back to my lookout and got unpacked. Since Ive been back I can just feel somethings off. I haven't heard anything about Jc and still I haven't heard back about the missing family yet, I'm hoping for some good news. These woods hold onto something dark and I'm gonna find out what. Ill check back in soon. T."},"34":{"title":"People don't believe I had a brother.

And…I’m sorry for the trouble I’ve caused.”\n\n \n\nShe waved away my words.  “Not at all.  That’s what we’re here for.”\n\n \n\n“So when can I get back out?  I have responsibilities at work, and…”  I hooked my thumb at the panic button on the wall,  “Well, being here is kind of nerve-wracking.”\n\n \n\nDr. Smalls glanced at the button and then smiled at me.  “I understand.  We try to make it comfortable, but it’s still intimidating at first.  And don’t take the button personally.  All of the interview and meeting rooms have them, just in case.”  Glancing back down at her notes, she tapped the paper with her pen.  “Unfortunately, we have to keep you for the full 72 hours—there are some cases—like yours—where I’d be inclined to release you early, but the hospital asks us to do the full observation once ordered for liability reasons.  So that puts you getting out around…4pm day after tomorrow.”\n\n \n\nI grimaced.  “No way of getting out before then?”\n\n \n\nShe shook her head.  “I’m afraid not.  But it won’t be bad.  You’re welcome to stay in your room or go out into the public activity areas during the day and early evening hours.  And I’ll come talk to you again before you go home.  Unless you have more you’d like to tell me now, of course.”\n\n \n\nGiving her a smile I didn’t feel, I nodded.  “No, but I appreciate it.  Glad to come clean about what was really going on too.”\n\n \n\nThe doctor hopped out of the chair and patted my arm as she passed by.  “Sometimes confession really is good for the soul.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nThat evening was quiet.  I stayed in my room, and while I hated being confined, the idea of a barrier between me and my parents was a huge relief.  I’d spent hours trying to think of what to do once I got out, but was no closer to any real answer.\n\n \n\nWhat if they were just waiting outside the hospital, waiting to scoop me up?  Or maybe not.  They could just as easily get when I got back home.  Other than running—like truly running away and abandoning my life and identity—what hope did I have of actually stopping them?  But then again, what choice did I have?\n\n \n\nI didn’t sleep well that night, and was still fitfully dozing mid-morning when Dr. Smalls opened my door and stepped inside.  Her cheerful demeanor from the day before was gone, replaced with a concerned frown.  She asked if she could come in and speak with me, and sitting up on the edge of my bed, I told her sure.  \n\n \n\nRubbing a hand through my hair, I offered her an uncertain smile.  “Is something wrong?”\n\n \n\nSitting in a guest chair on the other side of the room, she cleared her throat as she gave a small nod.  “It seems that way, yes, though maybe it’s just a misunderstanding.”\n\n \n\nI frowned.  “Misunderstanding about what?”\n\n \n\n“Well, you told me and everyone else about your younger brother, Mark, correct?”\n\n \n\n“Um, yeah.  Of course I did.”\n\n \n\n“And you actually spent a great deal of your time with your therapist talking about Mark as well?”\n\n \n\n“Look, what is this…”\n\n \n\nShe raised a hand.  “Please, just answer me.”\n\n \n\nLetting out a breath, I nodded.  “Yes.  I’ve talked about Mark a lot.”\n\n \n\n“Mark, your biological brother, who you grew up with and is your best friend?”\n\n \n\nI felt myself starting to get irritated and pushed it back down.  “Yes, that’s the one.”\n\n \n\nDr. Smalls nodded.  “Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I was clear.”  Smoothing her pants leg, she kept her tone measured as she continued.  “Stephen, I did not meet your parents yesterday.  But I did review some notes put into the system from the front desk when they arrived.  They apparently said that you have delusions and they’d like to see you transferred to a facility closer to their home.”  When I started to protest she raised her hand again.  “Don’t worry, unless something changes, you are still getting out at 72 hours, and they don’t decide such things.  If that was all that had been said, I’d have thought they were just trying to get access to you or delegitimize any accounts of abuse you might be sharing.  But then they told the woman working the front desk something else.”\n\n \n\nI stared at her.  “What?”\n\n \n\nDr. Smalls looked up at me again.  “That you don’t have a brother, Mark or otherwise.  That you never have.”\n\n \n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?”\n\n \n\nShe shook her head.  “Not me.  Them.  Again, I put very little stock in a stranger’s word, especially with what you told me yesterday about them.  So I spent a couple of hours this morning trying to prove they were lying.  Your psychiatrist took detailed notes from your sessions, and you have spent a great deal of time talking about Mark.  Where he lived, where he went to school, all kinds of past and present details that should be verifiable.”\n\n \n\nI smiled.  “Good.  Thank God.  Thank you so much for taking the…”\n\n \n\nDr. Smalls gave another small shake of her head, her eyes sad.  “Stephen, I can’t find any trace of him.”\n\n \n\nMy tongue began to shrivel in my mouth.  “That…that’s not possible.”\n\n \n\n“Was your brother born in the same county as you?”\n\n \n\nI nodded.  “Um, yeah.  He was.”\n\n \n\nShe returned my nod.  “I guessed that might be the case.  I can find your birth certificate, not his.  I contacted his college.  I had to push a bit, but I got them to check enrollment going back four years.  No sign of him there.  Our auxiliary office has access to a people search database.  They use it to find relatives of patients and early debt-collection mainly, but it is surprisingly thorough.  It can find most people if they’ve ever held a job, rented an apartment or been in school.  Not just them, but other people they’re connected or related to.  I asked them to run Mark an hour ago.  And what do you think they found?”  She let out a sigh.  “No sign of him at all.”\n\n \n\nMy mind was going in a hundred directions as she spoke.  “Was she in on this?  Or being controlled, maybe?  Anything was possible, but I didn’t feel the sense of wrongness that my parents gave off.  It seemed like she was being honest, and was honestly concerned that I was lying or crazy.  So what, did they wipe his records or something?  I didn’t see how that was possible, but how could I rule it out with everything I’d seen?  If only…\n\n \n\n“Dana.”\n\n \n\nDr. Small stopped and frowned at me.  “Who?”\n\n \n\nI waved my hand.  “It’s…okay, so growing up, when Mark was in junior high, everybody was getting girlfriends and boyfriends.  It was like a thing, okay?  So him and this girl in his class, Dana, started “dating”, which really just meant they hung out awkwardly during breaks and after school a bit.  Then some of his friends started making fun of them, so he ghosted her.  Avoided her for like two months.  I didn’t even know most of it was going on until I came home from college one weekend and saw this sad girl sitting outside our house.\n\n \n\n“She told me that her name was Dana and she’d been hanging out with Mark for awhile, but then he stopped talking to her.  That it was okay if he didn’t want to go steady or whatever, but she really wanted to still be his friend and hang out, if that was okay with him.  It could have come off as weird or something, but she was nice about it, not creepy.  He was just being a jerk and not listening to her.”  I gave a sad laugh.  “It was about the only time I was ever disappointed in him.  So I took her number.  Memorized it and promised he would call and give her a chance to clear the air and let them start being friends again.”  I shrugged.  “I did, and he did.  Ever since she’s been one of his closest friends.” \n\n \n\nDr. Smalls stared at me for a moment and then pulled out her cell phone.  “Do you still remember the number?”\n\n \n\nI nodded.  “I do.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\n“Hello, is this Dana?  Hi, Dana.  This may sound strange, but I’m actually calling you to verify some information.  My name is Dr. Smalls and I have a young man who is a patient of mine named Stephen who remembers you.  More importantly, he says his brother Mark is one of your closest friends since junior high.  I think you two even called yourselves dating for a bit back then.”\n\n \n\nI can see Dr. Smalls face droop and then harden as she listens to the woman on the other end of the line.  “I see.  And you are certain?  I see.  Well, thank you very much for your time.”  When she ended the call, I already knew what she had heard.\n\n \n\n“She doesn’t remember him at all, does she?”\n\n \n\nSmalls shook her head.  “She does not.  She says the only Marks she knows is her cousin in New York and the landlord for her building.”  Her tone grew cooler.  “And she did not appear to be lying.”\n\n \n\nI nodded bleakly.  “Okay.  Um, I don’t…I don’t know then.  Maybe I can think of some other way to prove it, but if they can erase him from Dana’s mind, why is the next thing going to work?  I just…”  I felt myself growing close to tears.  “They just keep taking him.”\n\n \n\nDr. Smalls leaned forward, her expression sympathetic.  “Stephen, just because your involuntary committal will likely be up tomorrow afternoon…that doesn’t mean you can’t stay voluntarily.  You seem like a great guy who is having a really hard time, and we’d be happy to help you through it.”\n\n \n\nStaring at her, I felt like I was teetering on the edge between giving in or screaming at her.  Instead, I just shook my head.  “I’m…I’m just tired.  Sorry I wasted your time.”\n\n \n\nShe nodded.  “I’ll let you get some rest.  And if you want to talk again, I’ll be around this afternoon.”\n\n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nI spent the next few hours turning everything over in my head.  I wasn’t crazy.  I didn’t believe that.  I hadn’t invented a whole life in my head where everything was the same, even Dana’s number, but with a fake brother plugged into it.  But arguing things like that wouldn’t convince anyone of anything, because my parents, or whatever they were, had eaten Mark and erased him from the world.\n\n \n\nAnd they wanted to do the same to me.\n\n \n\nI suddenly sat up in bed, wiping at my cheeks as I got up and went to the door.  Outside I saw Gertie trundling along with the first of the lunch carts.  “Gertie!  Miss Gertie!”\n\n \n\nShe looked up with an affable smile.  “Yes?  Do you need something?”\n\n \n\nI nodded, heart hammering in my chest as I returned her smile.  “I do, if you don’t mind.  Can you get Dr. Smalls a message for me?”\n\n \n\nShe frowned and then gave a nod.  “Sure, young man.  What is it?”\n\n \n\n“Tell her I’ve changed my mind.  If she can get them here in the morning, I’d really like for my parents to come for a [visit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Verastahl\/).”\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},"35":{"title":"There’s something in the night sky, and it’s watching me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfhlwo\/theres_something_in_the_night_sky_and_its\/","flair":null,"author":"Kinkajou_Incarnate","selftext":"I had to put up blackout curtains in my bedroom.  The old ones wouldn’t quite go all the way to the edge of the window, and you could see into parts of the room around them.  At first I taped them so that there were no gaps, but if anyone came over, that would make me look insane.  It’s occurred to me that I might be insane, but overall my life isn’t that bad.  The only reason I’m writing this is to see if it’s happened to anyone else.\n\nThere are two rules that I have to follow, and other than that, things are okay.\n\nOne: I can’t be outside at night.  Ever.  For that reason, I never drive anywhere that I couldn’t walk home before dark if my car died or something.  My work is about a mile from my house.  I always go to the same grocery store.  There are a few nice walks within a couple of miles.  Travel is hard, but if I get flights early in the day I can go see my parents or go to weddings or whatever.\n\nTwo: I can’t be within three feet of a window at night.  Rather than putting tape on the floor or something equally psychotic, I just have tables or other furniture that keeps me from getting too close.  I have my bed on the opposite side of the room, and if I’m feeling extra anxious, I have a child gate that fits into the window behind the curtain.  For some reason knowing that the curtain couldn’t go anywhere is comforting.  If I put on headphones with white noise, that helps, too.\n\nFollowing those two rules, I can live a pretty normal life.  I have to admit, not being able to go anywhere after the sun goes down has made me appreciate the mornings, and my sleep schedule is the best it’s ever been.  The one thing that I miss the most is seeing the stars, but I don’t think I will again.\n\nThe first time it happened, I was 35, solo camping in Glacier National Park.  There were plenty of other people at the campground, but I was in my own spot, in a nice forested area.  My site was the last one on the road, near the lake, and a little isolated.  At the time, I was very happy to have gotten it.\n\nIt was spring, and the park had just opened to cars.  There weren’t really many mosquitoes yet, so I was just outside my tent, looking at the stars, drinking a beer.  Lake Macdonald was close to the campsite, and I had heard there could be northern lights, so I went out to the lakeshore, carrying a camping chair and wearing my unzipped sleeping bag like a shawl.\n\nThe stars were brilliant, and I could see the milky way stretching over the dark outlines of pointed mountains.  There was no moon, but you could make your way across the gravelly shore by starlight.  I’d never experienced anything like it, even though I’d been stargazing a few times.  Pulling a beer from my six pack, I sat down in my chair, and stared up at the sky.  It was around 11PM, which is usually when the aurora starts getting good.\n\nIt was beautiful, although faint.  Gentle green and purple lines over the mountains, reflecting on the still water.  Wrapped in the sleeping bag I actually dozed off, exhausted from hiking all day.\n\nThat was when it woke me up.\n\nThe northern lights were brighter, like you see in pictures.  As stunning as it was, I only felt fear.  Frozen in the chair, I looked up at the sky, as if something was going to come out of it.  There was *nothing* there.\n\nIn the middle of the bright stars, surrounded by the aurora, there was a little hole, a space, that was completely black.  It didn’t have sharp edges, but everything faded toward the center of it, leaving… nothingness.\n\nGoosebumps went across my scalp, and I held perfectly still, hoping that it wouldn’t notice me.  It sounds ridiculous to say it like that, I know.  Why would a dark spot in the sky notice me, or be sentient at all?  Maybe it isn’t, I can’t really say.  That was just how I felt.\n\nWhen the sound started, the pang of fear that went across my body actually *hurt*, as all of my muscles tensed up and I felt a panic which had only existed in childhood nightmares.  It was deafening, a low sound that oscillated, kind of a *wub wub wub* noise.  It felt like it went through my bones, and even terrified, I looked at the gravel around my feet and saw it shaking.\n\nI threw my sleeping bag to the ground, knocking over the chair as I started to run.  I ran back to the campground, which still had some lights on.  There were other people there, a flashlight or two.  I saw the light on the bathrooms, and sprinted toward it instinctively.  Throwing the door open, I ran into the back corner and curled into a ball, arms around my knees.\n\nThe sound was gone, but I couldn’t make myself get up.  I sat in the fluorescent lights, curled on the floor.  After maybe half an hour, a guy came in to brush his teeth.  He saw me on the floor and asked if I was okay.  I asked him if he’d heard a loud noise, a loud low noise.  He said he hadn’t, and asked if I was okay again.  I knew I looked crazy, so I said that I was feeling sick and just wanted to stay close to the toilet.  I’m sure he thought I was on drugs.  He brushed his teeth and left without saying anything else.\n\nAfter another hour or so, the concrete floor was getting uncomfortable.\n\nI thought that the whole thing must have been in my head.  It made total sense; I was asleep, had a nightmare, and freaked out.  I was still asleep for the sand moving part, but didn’t realize it.  If it had been real, everyone would have heard it.  Washing my face in the sink with cold water,  I was awake.  Looking in the mirror, I actually laughed, thinking about how silly I had acted.\n\nWhen I opened the door and stepped back out under the night sky, there was a tension in the air, like when you’re close to a big power line.  With the outside light next to me, I couldn’t make out any stars, or see the dark spot.  But I knew it was there.\n\nThe noise started to come back, a crescendo rumbling up from silence, and I looked to the sky.  The light on the side of the stucco building was right next to me, preventing me from seeing anything past the eaves, but I knew I wasn’t dreaming it.  There were moths around the light, and they all fell to the ground.\n\nI still had my hand on the open door, that was how fast it had happened.  I darted back inside, breathing hard running only fifteen feet back to my spot against the wall.  The sound went away.\n\nI spent the night there.  A few people came and went, awkwardly ignoring me, or asking if they could help.  I said the same thing, that my stomach was just upset and I wanted to be near the toilet.  It was the best I could think of.\n\nOnce the sun came up, a bunch of people started coming in, both stalls were occupied, and the sinks had one or two people at each.  In the bright morning, with birds singing and cars running and people laughing, it seemed safe.  I opened the door.\n\nThere was no sound.  No hole in the sky.\n\nI had two more nights but left early.  When I got back to my house in the afternoon, I just played video games all day.  I didn’t tell anyone I’d come home early, because then they might ask why, and I didn’t want to talk about it or think about it or admit that it had happened.\n\nI had no desire to go outside.  I closed all of the blinds when the sun was setting, and just drank and watched shows until about 1 AM.  When I went to bed, I had a hard time sleeping, but eventually did.\n\nThe next day, I went to the grocery store.  I was a bit tentative opening my door, but things were fine.  It was a beautiful day, everything was green after about 6 months of winter, and I was feeling pretty good.  It wasn’t until the sun went down that it came back.\n\nI was on my couch, next to the window, which was open.  As the street lights flickered on, and it grew dark I felt uneasy.  Just a little tickle of fear, like you would have as a kid imagining that something was under your bed.  Over my left shoulder, the sky loomed through the window, and I couldn’t help myself.  I looked out.\n\nPutting my head close to the glass to look up at the dark sky, that powerful humming came back.  The glass began to shake and I recoiled, throwing myself to the far side of the couch, then pulling my legs in as if something would break through the window and grab them.\n\nBut nothing did.  The humming faded away.\n\nI spent the night on cushions and blankets on my bathroom floor, with the door closed.  It’s the only room in my apartment with no windows.\n\nIt had followed me.\n\nI still wonder why, every night.  During the day, I do fine, and don’t even think about it most of the time.  It’s just a part of life, like checking for cars before you cross the street.\n\nThere was only one other night, a few months later, where I even got close to a window.  I had been drinking, a lot.  As scared as I was, I managed to get angry.  It wasn’t fair that this was happening to me, and whatever it was could just kill me or fuck off, as far as I was concerned.  I’d left the living room window open, and gathered up my courage before walking up to it.\n\nThe sound came.  I gritted my teeth, said I would stand my ground no matter what.\n\nBut it got louder.  And louder.  And louder, that *wub wub wub wub* drilling into my brain, causing a fear like I never knew a sound could.  I fell back, crawling away from the window, from the black night sky, until it disappeared.  I sobbed after that.  Sometimes, I still cry when I think about it.\n\nNot knowing is the worst part.  Having no idea what it is, why it wants me.\n\nMaybe I’m crazy.  I’m considering going to therapy, even though I really don’t believe that it could help.\n\nBut I have no doubt that if anyone else has heard it, they will know what I’m talking about immediately.  So now, at risk of sounding insane, I’ll ask:\n\nHas anyone else heard it?\n\n[...More](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/patrickmullensauthor\/comments\/1kern3o\/patrick_mullens_written_work\/)"},"36":{"title":"Don’t eat

you know that according to the CDC, 55% of people in the food and service industry kill themselves a year? I’ve thought about it a few times. I hate this life, I've given far too much of it to something that at the moment felt so important, so crucial, and then woke up one day and none of it mattered. I started so enthusiastic, so full of life. I just wanted to make something of myself, to be important.\n\n   I fell into my first kitchen job, I was hopeless, almost homeless, and all I wanted to do was find a purpose, anything. That's when a friend of a friend offered me a position as a dishwasher at a local diner. Diner food isn't the finest of cuisine, but I watched the cooks work and it looked easier than dishwashing and paid a whole lot more so I jumped at the first opportunity to get on the line. Since then I've been hopping between better and better places honing my craft. \n\n   When you cook, time is a commodity. In the loud cacophony of clinks, tickets printing, and yelling, time is my only companion. My only guide towards the perfect result. I hold great pride in that, in my time. I wear a watch on the line for the sole purpose of keeping up with my times, pushing myself to be faster, and better. I raise blinders to the world and run my hand with grace through the space which I am allotted. Time and the efficiency at which I had used it was my only refuge, now it's my prison. \n\n   I’ve always been pretty intuitive. That video where they tell you to count how many times a ball is thrown and then at the end ask if you saw the gorilla, I always saw the gorilla. Since the first day I set foot in a kitchen, I always felt something was strange. There's a shadow over all kitchens, something that looms over us. I always thought it was just the pressure, long hours with no breaks, being yelled at, constantly told you're not good enough, it affects your soul. The side effects of working in a kitchen affect some more than others but when they hit they hit. \n\n   It may just be years of drug and alcohol abuse but I swear some cooks just have a look and feel about em’. They'll look ten years older than they should, have huge bags under their eyes, really just looking disheveled in general. Like they've given up. And then every now and then you’ll meet someone who just pisses you off by the way they are. They'll have been there for years for some reason, someone so stupid and far gone you’d have a hard time even picturing a version of them that wasn't so horrible to be around.\n\n   I always promised myself I wouldn't be one of those people, engulfed by the job, just a husk walking around. I thought I could maintain, just continue being me, a kind, happy guy, who loves his job. It's been fifteen years now, I've broken the promise. I had some friends but they all moved away, got married, or just lost interest in me I guess. I never found anyone to love. I’ve had a few one-night stands come home from the bar but no one seems to want to be with a guy like me. A cook, a loser. So all I do is work now. I have two jobs and no life. I hate it but It pays\n\n  Today as I was leaving work I noticed something strange. The time on my watch was three minutes ahead of the time on the time clock. I was a tad bit perturbed by the notion it was wrong as I hadn’t hit any of the buttons on my watch on accident that day, I’m sure I would have heard the little beep it would’ve made. But I checked my phone and it said the same thing. I do work in a hectic environment as a cook so it isn't unreasonable that I could have bumped it into something by accident. But then it happened again the next day, and this time it was ten minutes. Now three times is a hard to believe number of hitting your wrist without knowing, but believable nevertheless. \n \n   There is absolutely no way I could have bumped my wrist into anything ten times and not noticed. And it was an extremely slow day at that so there would have been no opportunities to have even done so. “Welp, my watch is broken,” I thought. So I bought a new one at the gas station the next day and thought nothing of it. Think of my surprise when, you guessed it, my brand new watch does the exact same thing the next day. But this time the time clock was a whole hour behind my watch.\n     \n   Now, I know that my watch isn't malfunctioning, today was an exceptionally slow day and I paid expert attention to the watch, comparing it with my phone's time. It passed the test, every hour, on the hour, it showed the correct time. But when I got to that machine a whole hour somehow slipped from underneath me. I quickly pulled my phone from my pocket and it confirmed that my watch was a whole hour ahead of time. \n\n   No, this can't be, I refuse to believe that my phone which confirmed while walking up to this machine that the time was correct on my watch, is now somehow a whole hour behind sed watch. This is insane. And then I realized, I have to go back to work now, for another whole hour. \n    \n  “Where the fuck have you been,” yelled my chef, pissed off that I had left in the middle of an apparent rush. “Sorry chef, somethings up with my watch. It said it was ten already.” I said defeated. “There's a clock on the wall dumbass, stop fucking around,” he said sternly. I didn't want to test him so I hurried back to my station. “Dude what the fuck,” said Jim. “I had to do that whole table by myself, pay attention,” he said exasperated as if the whole dining room had been ordering from the station I had left behind. \n\n   I looked up at the dining room and in fact, there was no one there. “Where'd everyone go?” I said. “They left before you got here,” he said in a hurry to get back to his station. He scurried off to his side of the line, resorting himself to an upside-down bucket and the videos on his phone.\n     \n   I looked at Jim for a moment, that guy,  he sorta disgusted me. Short and fat, his eyes never looked at you at the same time, and his mouth was always disgustingly sopping wet. Sometimes he just stares off into the distance, drool swinging from his engorged moist bottom lip. I hate everything that man stands for. Everything he does is an affront to me. He never works, he just acts like he does. He’ll pick up a broom just to sweep dirt around, never to pick it up with a dustpan. All to avoid doing his actual job, which is cooking. \n      \n   But I prefer it that way, because when he actually cooks, he does it like a disgusting slob who shouldn't be allowed within a hundred feet of a kitchen. Constant cross contamination, shells in eggs, undercooked chickens, broken sauces, and rice that is both burnt and undercooked. This man is an anomaly. But Chef refuses to fire him. I’ll never know why. \n     \n   There is nothing in the world I want more than to go home at this moment. In defeat, I lean onto my workstation looking at the mess Jim made. Since I had thought my shift was over I wrapped all of my pans up. And of course, that sack of shit Jim plopped his greasy little hands through the plastic instead of unwrapping them. I looked at him in disgust, he was picking his nose now. Paying me no mind. “Whatever,” I said under my breath. I rewrapped all the exposed pans, wiped up all the oil and sauce Jim had sloppily drizzled my station with, and resigned myself to my own makeshift seat. \n      \n   I glanced at my watch out of habit. What I saw confused me. Since the last time I had attempted to clock out, three more hours had, according to my watch, gone by. That couldn't have been possible, it couldn't have been but six minutes since I did that. I looked at my Phone to confirm. I knew it was impossible but I still had this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach like there was something wrong. And, to my chagrin, there definitely was something wrong. My phone confirmed it.\n      \n   Now I figured at this point I had a few options. I could either ignore this, act like nothing happened and just leave when I feel like an hour had gone by. Or, I could try and clock out now. For a second I gave in, took a breath, and sat back to think. Maybe I am overthinking this, maybe both my phone and my watch are broken, maybe this is all in my head.\n\n   Then I looked at my phone. It said it was five o’clock in the morning, the next day. A shock ran down my spine with a violence shaking me as it passed down my vertebrae. I shot up. ‘No, this can’t, I’m not crazy!’ I thought. My mind raced as I ran to the break room.\n      \n   That little tablet, that black box hanging on the wall. It had the exact same time on it as when I had last checked it. My mouth hung agape, my eyes bulged, and I laughed. Not even a minute had gone by since I had checked it. I calmed myself, I took a breath and I rationalized. It’s a rare occasion but everything must just have been broken at the same time.\n      \n   Chuckling to myself I turned around and walked down the hallway to the chef's office. What was waiting for me at the end of that hallway still haunts me. As I began to reach the end of the passage, I heard something. I heard the voices of a full dining room, the sound of conversation and forks clicking on porcelain. And as I rounded the corner to look out on this supposedly full dining room. I was met with nothing. And when I say nothing I mean void. \n\n   No light, no sound. The only detectable feeling being a breeze, a hot sticky breath from the maw of nothingness. I tried to look away but It followed my gaze. Something licked my hand. I jerked my arm back only to trip on myself and fall into the void. Something caught me. It grabbed my arms and legs outstretching them, the back of my neck was met with a tongue and hot breath to match the dank that now encapsulated me. \n      \n   Then I opened my eyes. I was sprawled out on the floor. I instinctively gripped the back of my neck. It was dry but I could still sense what had happened as if I was being forced to remember every second. I shifted into a fetal position, vomit slid from my mouth as I lay shivering. After a few minutes of suffering, I heard movement in front of me. I opened my eyes and lifted my head only to see the foot of my chef crashing down at me, and then nothing. \n      \n   When I woke up I was in the chef's office, tied to a chair. The vomit on my mouth had dried. My chef sat across his desk staring at me with a blank expression. He looked down as he began to speak, “you’ve seen it now, and he’s seen you,” he said in a soft voice that I’d never heard him use. “Chef what’s going on,” I said, still in a daise. “He’s kissed you on the neck, he wants you,” he said in a whisper. \n\n   “Chef what the fuck,” I screamed. Just then he slouched down, his head almost meeting his stomach and his arm limp at his side. I leaned back trying to escape his aura. His head shot back up hitting the desk on its way with a loud clunk, blood splattered on the wall behind him and he screamed as loud as he could. His eyes rolled into the back of his skull exposing the full whites of his eyes, he was fully erect, the veins on his neck looked as if they were to explode. \n\n   Tears were streaming down the sides of his face, his skin turning purple. His throat started to hiss and gurgle. “ DONT EAT DONT SLEEP HE WANTS YOU.” whined from his ragged vocals for about three minutes as I watched on in horror. Then his body went limp, his head hit the desk with a loud crunch, and then his body the floor. And I could do nothing but look at him and his lifeless body and cry as the lights in the room flickered and a darkness crept in on me from the corners of my eyes.\n      \n   I raised my shoulders up against my cold exposed neck and struggled with my bindings. With tears streaming down my cheeks I cried so hard that I couldn’t breathe, my lungs shocked with every gulp of air. The only thing I could think to do was close my eyes and wait for the inevitable defilement. As I sit there waiting I feel the hot stinking breath of my horror. And then I heard a click.\n\n   I open my eyes with relief to see the room I’m in is how it should be. I look behind me to see Jim poking through the door staring at me. “Hey,” I said looking back at him.  “Stop being so loud,” he said. Even now, even when he was the only thing that could save me, I couldn't be patient with him. “Get over here and help me,” I yelled. He opened the door all the way and looked at me, just standing there staring. At first, I had a rush of anger but then it was followed by fear. I was helpless, tied up, and injured.\n\n   He knew I didn’t like him, that I hated him. Right now he could hurt me, or worse, and I have no mode of action to stop it. My breath fastened and my eyes widened at the implication. He took a step forward, a whimper left my mouth as air involuntarily escaped past my vocal cords. I could feel the muscles in my throat tense and bulge into my mouth, my neck was sore from the stress. \n\n  As he got closer a bead of sweat ran down my forehead landing on my lips. He reached my side and bent down to my ear, my body stretched away from him, but he leaned in closer, his disgusting stomach rubbing my bond arm and his hand on the desk for support. \n\n   His breath stank of rot and his breath’s moisture stung my ear with every hot gross pronunciation. “I was like you once. You can leave but he’ll have you, and you’ll be like me.” I turned to him with a scowl. He looked back at me with indifference in one eye and the other towards the distance. His mouth agape, only closing to slurp down the disgusting slobber pooling in his mouth. Then he got up, pulled a knife from his pocket, and cut me loose. Then he sombered off disappearing into the now pitch black hallway.\n\n   I looked down at Chef, blood had started squirting from his head onto my leg. My eyes widened and I ran to the bathroom. I wet some towels and scrubbed my legs until my hands were numb. I cried a lot, Chef wasn't the best but he didn't deserve whatever that was. I started breaking down, I couldn't handle it. I tried to stand up but fell back to my knees. I beat the floor in frustration, then began beating my fists on my head. \n\n   Once I ran out of energy I gathered myself and rose to my feet. Rinsing my face with water I started to calm. Then I looked up, pain filled my chest, and horror my heart. It looked as if my face had swollen but it wasn't red. Then in horror, I watched as my face shifted. Bumps moving beneath my skin molding my face into something new. I dug at my visage, ripping my skin, pulling at my flesh. I fell to the floor arching my back, rolling in a struggle towards myself. I started running, my feet slipping on my own blood. I had to leave. \n\n   I didn’t bother clocking out this time. I drove straight home in silence. When I got home I went to my bathroom and looked into the mirror. Nothing was moving, my face wasn’t swollen, there were just scratches and tears from my own hands. I sat down in my chair and I screamed and cried and beat my head with my fists until I fell asleep. And then in the middle of the night, I woke up to a warm, dank, breath on my face. I shot up. I wasn’t there, but I think at some point I was. \n\n   Again I cried, and I decided something. Whatever it is that lives beyond time in that void, whatever wants me. It can’t have me. I won't be like Jim, I’ve already begun to forget things. I haven't eaten, I haven't slept. If it doesn’t already have me, it will, so I’m going to kill myself. I just want someone to believe me before I die, and to warn others. Don't let your life slip by, don't let it consume you.\n"},"37":{"title":"I thought I was just doing a job, until I realized we were building a machine to look backward in time.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfk1q0\/i_thought_i_was_just_doing_a_job_until_i_realized\/","flair":"Series","author":"badboyben69","selftext":"I had recently picked up a job as “Chief Security Officer” at a software development company. \n\nThey didn’t have much use for cybersecurity personnel at that point, as most security affairs were taken care of by artificial intelligence. But I was present for almost anything that involved the company’s simulation servers, just as a last resort. Basically, I was there to make sure the AI didn’t bug out.\n\nOne day, we were working on a new physics engine. This engine was honestly mind blowing. It could simulate hundreds of factors at once. For example, just walking or running in a game, this engine understood the slight alterations in speed depending on the gravity, torque, momentum, friction, and even the way vibrations would travel through the skeleton upon exerting force into the ground. It used these factors, combined with the muscle mass, height, bone density and age of the character walking to create an almost indistinguishable-from-reality simulation of walking. All of this, built from the atomic level up. And it didn’t stop with walking. \n\nWe were working on a specific simulation so we could roll out the engine to sports games. I remember it so distinctly. It was just a man hitting a baseball. We were using a combination of AI and engineers, watching different scans, audio and video recordings of real-life baseball, attempting to isolate all of the different variables. There were some easy ones. The strength, the angle, the wind. But even with these variables stagnant, the ball was never landing in the same exact place twice. Finally, we thought we had found the culprit. There were slight atomic variations when it came to the angle. It was seemingly impossible for a batter to hit a ball the exact same way twice, even if it appeared as if they did to the naked eye. After realizing this and tweaking everything accordingly, it still didn’t work. We realized shortly after that the way we were generating the baseball was important as well, as no two baseballs are exactly the same. We had some slight variations in the material make-up of the balls to keep it more realistic when playing a game, but for the purpose of this simulation, we needed every ball to be microscopically identical. Identical balls, bats, identical atomic angles.\n\nNow, finally we could run the simulation. And it worked. The batter would hit the ball 101.3m away from home plate. The ball would bounce twice, and land with the logo facing up. Every. Single. Time. Sitting from the back and watching this simulation take place, something came into my mind. A stupid question, really. I decided to ask one of the engineers, someone who had been friendly with me since I started working here.  \n  \n“Hey man.. So, we know all of these variables, probably hundreds of data points by now, that cause the ball to land in this exact position, right?”  \n  \n“I mean yeah, that‘s the whole point.” He replied, looking up from his monitor.  \n  \n“So, what if we just had the ball?” I asked, realizing how silly it might have sounded.  \n  \n“Then it wouldn’t go anywhere?” He said, looking back down at his monitor.  \n  \n“No, I mean, look, imagine the ball has already been hit. And we don’t have access to the ball being hit. Just where it landed. Could we, like, predict, or I guess, figure out exactly, what all those variables were that allowed the ball to land exactly where it was, and how it landed?”  \n  \n“Oh uh, yeah” said the engineer, now with some mild interest. “Yeah we probably could. We’d just have to reverse the process. Run a bunch of simulations until we figured it out. I don’t know how useful that would be for the engine, though.”\n\n“Maybe not for the engine. But what if we trained it on, I don’t know, a boat that sank to the bottom of the ocean. Could the engine, like, figure out how, when, and why the boat sank, where it was, et cetera?” I asked, realizing the absurdity of my hypothesis but unable to figure out why it wouldn’t work.   \n“If we think about it, the ball being thrown has maybe a hundred variables, and the boat sinking maybe has ten thousand, but we already know how powerful this engine is… I don’t know, maybe I’m--”\n\n“No, you’re right.” The engineer cut me off. “We would just need to train it enough on real world physics. How it all interacts. Radio and sonar scans, videos, everything we can get. It’s way too big a job for us engineers, but I bet the AI could do it. I just don’t see a reason they would sink that much money into it right now.” \n\nThinking about all of this, I had a thought, one that was so absurd, but again, I couldn’t understand why it wouldn’t work.   \n“Tell me, why wouldn’t we be able to.. Train it on a person? If it’s all just atoms moving around, bumping into each other. That’s all everything is, really, at its core. And our engine already knows how to simulate physics on an atomic level. It should, theoretically, be able to figure out why a person is the way that they are, physically and in terms of personality, just by observing them at the present moment… If we could figure out the path of a baseball, or a boat, then why not a person?  There’s only one distinct path they could have taken to be exactly the way they are right now. What if we could simulate exactly what that path must be?”   \n  \nI paused for a minute. I knew what I was about to say sounded crazy. \n\n“It would basically be time travel, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“Time travel? Well.. I don’t know about-- wait.. No, yeah, you’re right. It would be. With enough power, we could map out a person’s past. Well, theoretically, I think we could map out everyone’s past. Just from a small group of people, or maybe even one. A person should have a complex enough backstory, enough interactions that depend on other interactions, interactions that must have taken place exactly how they did for the person to take this distinct path.. Enough specific interactions that we could just scan one person, and get everyone’s whole lives, our whole lives. In a simulation. Now that’s a monetary incentive to get the higher-ups on board.”  \n  \nFrom one person? That didn’t make sense to me. But then it hit. What if we mapped out the path of the baseball, but didn’t stop at the baseball being hit by the bat? We could gather data on the intensity of the pitch, the state of the bat, the wind, the climate, the crowd. With this data, we could figure out a rough estimate of the build of the batter and the pitcher. We could figure out where it’s taking place. Now imagine if we had a million more variables. A person, instead of a baseball. We could get so much information about so much more.\n\nBewildered at the chain of thoughts I had sparked, unaware of what would come of it, I said “Not just our lives, but, the whole fucking universe since the beginning of time.”"},"38":{"title":"I stayed the night at my crazy uncle’s place.

Ours shows up each Thanksgiving. Trucker hat. Worn shirt. Faded jeans. We get to listen to his diatribes about the economy, the fake moon landing, and how Big Brother is trying to kill us with weather manipulation.\n\n“It’s not natural,” he says, clutching a turkey drumstick. “Those white streaks in the sky. It’s population control. Someone’s got to do something about it.”\n\nTypically, these conversations only last a few minutes. My family has learned the art of distracting him with questions, like, “So, Uncle Hank, how’s the new boat? Are you enjoying retirement? Did you get your hip looked at?”\n\nBut this last time, several Thanksgivings ago, it got really bad. Uncle Hank had a little too much to drink, got on one of his rampages, and wouldn’t stop. \n\n“The government’s cooking up another virus!” He shouted. “It’ll make Ebola look like the flu. It’ll go airborne and wipe out 70% of the population! We’ve gotta rise up!”\n\nHis tirade started to make Grandma sob. She had just lost Grandpa and was still processing her grief. Dad shifted in his seat, pissed, then leapt up. \n\n“Enough!” He said and escorted Uncle Hank out of the room.\n\n“Listen! I’m sorry,” Hank apologized. But Dad led him outside and slammed the door.\n\nI didn’t see much of him after that. But then, a few years later, my girlfriend, Vanessa, and I had to drive south to tour her new university. She had just been accepted to a Master’s Program and wanted to check out the campus. I was so proud.\n\nWe were navigating an isolated road when our GPS stopped working. Before long, our car ended up in the middle of a forested backroad, surrounded by darkness.\n\n“See anything?” Vanessa asked, checking for road signs.\n\n“No,” I said, craning my eyes. The sunlight was vanishing. Then… \n\n…the car shuddered. Violently. \n\n“Shit!”\n\nI pulled over and parked. \n\nSmoke billowed out from the hood as Vanessa and I got out. It was so cold the air clung to our skin. We pulled our jackets close. \n\nI didn’t have a flashlight, so Vanessa held her phone over me as I peered under the hood. I couldn’t see what was wrong. \n\nI called the tow truck company. They told me they couldn’t be there until the next day.\n\n“Damn.” I turned to Vanessa, cold air biting my skin. “Looks like we’re stuck here for the night.”\n\nShe buried her hands in her pockets. Shivering. “Do you know anyone here?”\n\nI frowned as I thought, “Yeah, I know someone.”\n\nI made the call. \n\nIt was about an hour later when Uncle Hank’s truck appeared down the road. He pulled up behind my car and stepped out, wearing his signature cowboy boots.\n\n“Wheewwee.” Uncle Hank whistled. “What have we got here?”\n\n“Hi, Uncle Hank.” \n\nI offered my hand to shake his. But he just gave me a big bear-hug. You know, the kind that feels like your ribs are about to break. Then, he turned to Vanessa. \n\n“Who’s this?” \n\n“Vanessa,” she said and shook his hand. “Thanks for saving us.”\n\n“My pleasure. It’s what anyone would do for family.” \n\nHank turned and peered inside my vehicle. He couldn’t figure out what was wrong either.  \n\n“Well, looks like the mechanic will have to sort this out.” He dusted off his hands on his pants. “Why don’t you stay over at my place? I’ll drive you to the shop in the morning.”\n\n“That’d be great, Uncle Hank.”\n\nVanessa and I got our bags. Left the keys in my car. Climbed into Uncle Hank’s truck and drove off. \n\nWe were in the cab for about five minutes when Uncle Hank cleared his throat. “So, where’d you two meet?”\n\n“University,” I said. \n\n“Ahhhh.” He leaned over, made eye contact with Vanessa. “Universities are for brainwashing. Lizard people use them as tools for indoctrination.”\n\n“Lizard people?” She said. \n\n“They rule the world.” \n\nShe just nodded. I could tell she was uncomfortable.\n\n“Best way to tell a Lizard Person is to —”\n\n“So, Uncle Hank,” I piped in. “How’s your boat running?”\n\n“Oh, that old thing?” He thought. “Boat’s fine. But the damn thing keeps breaking down. Just last weekend…” \n\nI smiled and relaxed, satisfied my question had diverted him. \n\nAbout thirty minutes later, we were at his place. It was a small squat building in the back end of nowhere. There wasn’t another house for miles. \n\n“Come on in,” he said and held the door open for us. “Don’t break anything or I’ll murder you.” \n\nVanessa and I looked at each other, disturbed by his off-putting joke. \n\n“Just kidding!” He said and pointed to a room down the hall. “You lovebirds can take the guest room.” \n\nHe signaled to another. “There’s the bathroom. Master bedroom’s around the corner. If you hear any strange noises, don’t come looking for me.”\n\nVanessa and I looked at each other: “What?”\n\n“I’ll let you two get unpacked. Goodnight.” He disappeared around the corner as I helped Vanessa move our bags to the guest room.\n\nA few minutes later, Vanessa went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. I stored our stuff in the closet and Uncle Hank popped in. “Pssst. Tommy.” \n\n“Yes, Uncle Hank?”\n\n“Your girlfriend. Is she a… Flat Earther?”\n\n“A what?”\n\n“Flat Earther. Like, does she believe the earth is round or —?”\n\nHe made a horizontal motion with his hands. I thought the question was strange, but I humored him. “I don’t know, Uncle Hank. I’ll have to ask her.”\n\n“Please do.”\n\nHe just stood there, looking at me. I prayed the awkward moment would pass, but it kept going. Finally, the sound of cascading water hit our ears. Vanessa must’ve started the shower. \n\n“Well, I better hit the hay.” Uncle Hank wrapped his knuckles on the door. “You lovebirds get some sleep. And remember, you hear any strange noises, don’t come knocking.”\n\nThe repeated comment creeped me out, but I shrugged it off. It was one night. How bad could it be? \n\n“Okay, Uncle Hank.” \n\nHe wandered into the hall. Footsteps pattering. I heard a door close and thanked God he was gone.  \n\nA few hours later, I flopped into bed next to Vanessa. Both dressed and ready for sleep. I held her hand as I drifted off. \n\nLater that night—God only knows when—I felt someone stir me awake.\n\nIt was Vanessa.  \n\n“Tom!\"\n\n“What?!” I sat up and rubbed the grogginess from my eyes.  \n\n“It’s your uncle…”\n\nI heard a loud moan come from the hall. Desperate. Pleading. Like someone was having a violent seizure.\n\nI sat up and listened. Another agonizing squeal erupted from his bedroom, like a person was being eaten alive.  \n\n“What the hell is that?” Vanessa said.   \n\n“I don’t know.” I scrambled up and went to the door.\n\nAnother painful groan.\n\n“Is your uncle okay?”\n\n“I’m sure he is.”\n\n“It sounds like he’s dying.”\n\nThe screams grew louder. Then, a gasp of pain. Almost sob-like. \n\n“Oh my god, Tom, do something!” \n\n“He told us to leave him alone!” \n\n“Just make sure he’s alright!” \n\nThe groans turned into a series of belly-wrenching screams. I ventured out of the room.\n\n“Ah, god! Help me! Help!” It was Uncle Hank. Wailing in misery.  \n\nI raced to his bedroom door. Pounded on it. \n\n“Uncle Hank?! What’s going on in there?” \n\nAnother loud scream. I twisted the knob. It was locked. \n\n“God, no! Help me! Ah…” His voice sounded shell-shocked, entreating. \n\n“I’m coming in!”\n\nI backed up and slammed my shoulder into the door. BANG. Then again. BANG. \n\n“Help me! Ah…”\n\nFinally, I broke through…\n\n… Uncle Hank’s bedroom was dark except for a sliver of moonlight peering through the window. \n\nHank was sitting on the edge of his bed. Gasping. \n\nAnd something… small, no bigger than a bulldog… was sitting on his shoulders. Whispering into his ears.\n\n“No, please… I can’t take any more…” Hank begged. \n\nThe shape’s voice sounded eerie and soft, almost seductive. But I couldn’t tell what it was saying.\n\n“Please… no more…” \n\nI crept back. Trying to rationalize the situation…\n\n“Your lies… hurt so much…”\n\nThen, my voice slipped out of my throat. It must’ve been a gut reaction to all the insanity. As soon as the words came, I wanted to pull them back in: “Uncle Hank, are you alright?”\n\nUncle Hank turned. His voice was cold, menacing, “I told you not to come in.” \n\n“I’m… I’m sorry…” \n\nHe leapt off his bed. Dashing toward me.  \n\nI tried getting away. But he grabbed my arm. Slapped a sweaty palm over my lips. Pinned me against the wall.\n\nI squirmed, trying to break free. But his grip was strong. \n\nUncle Hank leaned in close. His breath hot against my face. “You should’ve listened to me, Tommy.”\n\nI nodded, begging to be let go.\n\nThe weird shape was still atop his shoulders. Whispering. It was so dark I couldn’t tell what it was. But it had glowing yellow eyes. And the smell… uh… I can’t even describe it.\n\n“You must not tell anyone what you’ve seen.” Uncle Hank said. \n\nI was so scared. What was even happening?! I just nodded. Sweat pouring down my face. \n\nUncle Hank removed his hand and backed away. “Go to bed, Tommy.”\n\nI bobbed my head. Stumbled back into the hall, my mind swirling. \n\nI staggered to our bedroom. Leapt inside. Shut the door. \n\nVanessa just stared at me from the bed, white-knuckling her comforter. “What happened?!” \n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Seriously, Tom, what was it?”\n\n“I don’t know!” \n\n“Is he alright?”\n\n“I can’t tell you!”\n\nI just flopped in bed, silent, not wanting to make any more noise. \n\n“Why won’t you tell me?!”\n\n“Trust me… I can’t.”\n\nVanessa frowned and turned away. I sank back into my sheets, delirious, hoping to disappear. \n\nNeedless to say… \n\n… I didn’t sleep much that night. \n\nNext morning, I could hear Uncle Hank whistling through the house. Getting ready for the day. \n\nFive minutes later, he knocked on our door. “You kids want something to eat?”\n \nVanessa and I had just finished packing. We were both dressed and ready to go. “No thanks.”\n\n“Alright. Come on out when you’re ready and I’ll drive you over.”\n\nNot long after, Uncle Hank had shuttled us to the shop. We got to our car. Told the mechanic about our problems. Case closed.  \n\nUncle Hank pulled me aside after I had finished talking with the mechanic. “Now, listen, Tommy, about last night.” \n\n“It’s okay. We don’t need to talk about it —”\n\n“No, no… I need to apologize. You see, I’ve got this cat.” \n\nA cat?!\n\n“Sometimes when I get scared, it comes to me and sits on my shoulder. It tells me things to comfort me.”\n\nI just stood there, not knowing what to say. \n\n“Last night, it was telling me about my past…”\n\nUncle Hank’s voice drifted away as my mind blocked out his words. \n\n“Anyway,” he slapped a hand on my shoulder, reassuring me. “I’m sorry for overreacting. Let’s keep this between us, alright?” \n\n“Okay, Uncle Hank.” \n\nHe hiked back to his truck, waving goodbye to Vanessa. “Take care of my nephew!”\n\n“Will do!” She waved. Grateful to see him going.  \n\nUncle Hank got in his truck. Backed out. And merged onto the road.\n\nVanessa frowned. “You’re still not going to tell me what happened?!” \n\nI just shrugged. How could I? I didn’t even know what had happened. \n\nMy eyes glanced back to Uncle Hank’s truck as it shrank in the distance.\n\nIn the rear window, I could barely notice — \n\n— a small, bulldog-sized creature perched upon his shoulders… its yellow eyes focused on me…\n\nI had no idea what it was… but I knew this…\n\n… it sure as hell wasn’t a cat."},"39":{"title":"I keep seeing triangles and other things.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfzv4q\/i_keep_seeing_triangles_and_other_things\/","flair":null,"author":"Accomplished-Pen8837","selftext":"This happened in 2024, roughly November. It lasted for a long few weeks.\n\nIt started when I went to sleep one night, on a Monday.\n\nA dream. A nightmare, even.\n\nIt was strange and warped, and I don't remember it well, but it was me on the sidewalk outside of my grandparents house. I was in a third person view, but it wasn't me I was looking at—a twisted version of me with white skin and black and red marks, my face blurry and unrecognizable. My view slowly advanced toward my face, but it didn't become clear or visible. Just blurry. Not me.\n\nI thought nothing of it the next morning; I've always had weird, prophetic dreams and whatnot.\n\nBut things got worse. I kept seeing your average stereotypical old man in my dreams—grey hair, hunched back, black cane, dark blue jeans and a flannel shirt. He didn't say anything, just stared or was in the background of my dreams. The same exact man.\n\nThen I kept seeing triangles in my dreams. Everywhere. On a tree, someone's clothes, I mean everywhere.\n\nAnd then I saw them in real life. Outside my dreams.\n\nStars aligned in a crooked but unmistakable triangle.\n\nRoots jutting out of the ground in the formation of a triangle.\n\nIn the faint patterns of scratches on my walls; a triangle.\n\nEverywhere I looked—Triangle. Triangle. Triangle.\n\nI was sick of that word. Absolutely sick of it. Dream after dream, thought after thought, those wretched connected three lines haunted me. Sometimes, they even had a line in the middle of it, like a closed eye. In my dreams, the eye would slowly open but never enough so I could see beyond the lid.\n\nI searched up what it meant. \"The Holy Trinity.\" It was a triangle, yes, meant to be a sign from God.\n\nBut this? This felt sinister. Evil. Devious. If it was from God, I wouldn't have dread after my dreams and sightings of triangles everywhere, and it most likely wouldn't be  associated with a dark, dark red. Red enough to be red, but dark enough to be mistaken as black.\n\nI'd be in a forest of pine trees in my dreams, peaceful as the birds chirped ahead and the rays of the sun danced cheerfully.\n\nBut then the chirping would come to an abrupt stop.\n\nAll sound, cut off. Later on, with eerie silence, it was replaced by an unbearably loud blaring, like a cruise ship. It wailed forever and ever, then clouds of a sinister dark red would roll in, blotting out the sun and blue sky, instead a black carpet of nothingness. Slowly but surely, outlined in a fiery orange, clean lines would slice across the sky, connecting... Aligning...\n\nTopped off with a bridged line in the center of the lines.\n\nA triangle.\n\nThe line in the center, presumably an eye, would open and spread and inside I could see unfathomable horrors. I shudder at the thought. A massive black shape (which I saw flickers of in the corner of my eye outside my dreams) charging through the forest near my house, my town, crushing anything in its path, swallowing it and replacing everything I knew and loved and cared for into a undesirable void of nothing. Pandemonium broke out. The river I swam in, the bridge above it, the same dark water my dad caught a fish for the first time in years in, trees I saw everyday, houses I saw everyday, small little shops I visited and liked, the infamous ice cream shop—renovated into a void of nothing. Unlovable. Undesirable. Unremarkable. The black void flooded the planet I knew and loved and hoped to save from pollution one day. Every opportunity ripped away and every chance at feeling or seeing anything but a void black rippled away.\n\nAll hell broke out.\n\nAs the void spilled across vast fields, scaled mountains and cast a dark blanket over the oceans and rivers and everything,\n\nAll while the three-cornered shape loomed, watching me with its singular eye, filled with all negative things that could happen to me and everyone. All negative things that would happen. Had happened.\n\nEver since that one dream, I stopped seeing everything like that. Yes, I saw triangles, but not everywhere I looked anymore and no more dreams of them, no more dread, I was completely fine. Left with the confusion on what that dream meant and why I had it in the first place. Now, I get this odd lingering feeling of impending doom whenever I see a triangle. Not unbearable, but an anxious \"I have to leave\" feeling."},"40":{"title":"The Room That Wasn't There","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfe6rx\/the_room_that_wasnt_there\/","flair":null,"author":"Amko06","selftext":"You ever notice something in your house that… wasn’t? A corner that feels colder. A shadow that bends wrong. Maybe a door you swear didn’t used to be there.\n\nMine appeared on a Tuesday.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. One bedroom, one office. Always been that way. I work from home, no pets, no guests. Just me. But when I walked past the hallway that afternoon, there it was: a door on the left wall. Same color, same handle. Perfectly normal. Only problem? That wall’s *never* had a door.\n\nI stood frozen. Just stared. I even took out my phone to check old pictures. Wall’s empty in every single one.\n\nSo obviously I did the stupid thing: I opened it.\n\nIt was a room. Small. Empty. Dustless. Windowless. The air was warm, still. The floorboards were the same as the rest of the apartment, but… newer? Like freshly installed. The ceiling light flicked on automatically, humming softly.\n\nI stepped inside. Just for a second.\n\nWhen I stepped out again, it was night.\n\nI checked my phone: *3:42 a.m.*\n\nI’d lost over ten hours.\n\nI tried to convince myself I fell asleep, blacked out, whatever. But the next morning, the room was still there. And something was in it.\n\nA *chair*.\n\nNot like one I own. This one was old. Victorian maybe. Ornate carvings. Crimson velvet, worn down to threads in spots. And on the chair—*a single Polaroid*.\n\nIt was of me. Standing in the room. But I never took that photo.\n\nI slammed the door shut, locked it, pushed a bookshelf in front of it. I didn’t sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I pushed the shelf aside.\n\nThe room had changed.\n\nNow there were *three* Polaroids. Me sitting. Me looking up in confusion. And the third—*me screaming*.\n\nOver the next week, the room *grew*.\n\nSlowly. By inches. A side table one day. A coat rack the next. Every day, something was different. The lightbulb began to flicker. The air smelled like rotting wood. The photos multiplied.\n\nBut I never went in again.\n\nI started hearing things at night. Shuffling. A soft, dragging noise—like something pacing in a circle. One night, I heard humming. A lullaby I couldn’t place.\n\nAnd then, the photos started appearing *outside* the room.\n\nIn my fridge. My coat pocket. My shoe.\n\nOne was pinned to my pillow:  \n**Me. Sleeping.**  \nShot from above.\n\nI called my landlord. I asked about previous tenants. He hesitated before saying:  \n“You’re in 3B, right?”  \n“Yeah.”  \nHe paused again.  \n“There is no 3B.”\n\nI thought he was messing with me—until I went outside.\n\nThe building has *no third floor.*\n\nI live on the second floor.

Gone.\n\nJust… the door.\n\nAnd the chair. And the photos.\n\nHundreds now. Thousands maybe. Piled on the floor, pinned to the walls, floating in the air. All of me. Dozens of angles. All expressions.\n\nSome I don’t remember making.\n\nSome... I know I *never* made.\n\nSome photos are of me sleeping in places I’ve never been. One shows me with my eyes *stitched shut*.

Places I knew too well for them to be just dreams, but not from any memory I could name. At first it was harmless. A hallway that shouldn't exist. Familiar voices in a house I’ve never been inside. That sort of thing.\n\nThen came the sushi bar.\n\nIt was clean. Too clean. Empty, except for servers who moved just slightly out of sync with gravity. They didn’t blink. Thick slices of fish of all colors lined the bar. They brought me my favorite roll — I didn’t order. I hadn’t even spoken. The miso was warm, perfectly made. It should have comforted me.\n\nI did panic, briefly, thinking about how much this was going to cost. While I spiraled in my price anxiety, something struck me as off.\n\nBeneath the table, the floor wasn’t solid. There were vents. And behind those vents... something was breathing.\n\nI know how that sounds. I know. But you might understand what I'm trying to say if you’ve ever had a dream where you can *feel* someone else’s presence — and that presence isn’t human.\n\nI don’t think it was just a dream. Because something followed me out.\n\nI woke up sweating and twisted in bed. My cat looked up, briefly alarmed, then went back to sleep. I was disturbingly hungry. I have no idea how I slept until 3pm, but I had to get going.\n\nI went to my computer and geared up my workstation. I noticed my keyboard wasn’t lit up like it usually is. Knowing I needed sustenance, I opened up my delivery app and perused the options.\n\n“Sushi sounds good,” I said aloud to myself.\n\nI placed an order for several rolls and sashimi, then returned to my weirdly dead keyboard. I pulled on the cord to see if it was unplugged. The connection had been *chewed*. By mice, I assumed — though I’d never seen a mouse in my apartment.\n\nI dug out my backup wireless keyboard, booted everything up. No tasks appeared on my work queue — which only happens on Friday afternoons. But it wasn’t Friday. I checked our team chat. One new message, from my boss: a single smiley face. No subject. No context.\n\nWeird.\n\nI figured it was a prank and logged into a game instead. Hours passed. I got hungry again and checked the delivery app. It said the driver was outside.\n\nThree sharp knocks.\n\nI opened the door to find the *strangest* delivery person I’d ever seen.\n\nSky-high green mohawk. Gray trench coat. Leather boots. He looked like one of the kids I went to high school with — except he wasn’t.\n\nHe said nothing, just held out the food. When I reached for it, he grabbed my wrist.\n\n“It’s okay,” he said. “I’m here for you.”\n\nI froze.\n\n“They’re outside, but I blocked them for a while. They can’t get in.”\n\nHe let go of my wrist and ducked inside. “Here’s your food.”\n\nI gibbered. I stuttered. Then I half-shouted, “You need to get out of my house!”\n\nHe peeked through the blinds. “No worries, mate. I’m not here to hurt you. I’ve been sent to protect you from them.”\n\n“Them?” I asked. “THEM??”\n\n“Come look,” he said.\n\nI set the food down and, against my better judgment, followed him to the window. Outside looked normal. Cars. Joggers. Dog walkers.\n\n“I said look,” he repeated, “and I meant *look*.”\n\nI stared again — harder.\n\nThat’s when I saw it. In the bushes next to the trash bins: two long arms with claws. They retracted into the hedge slowly, deliberately.\n\n“You saw it?” he asked.\n\n“What the hell is going on?”\n\n“My name is Crater,” he said, “and I’m here to protect you.”\n\n“As you’ve said before,” I muttered. “Protect me from *what*?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. Instead, he ripped open the food bag. “Come. Let’s eat. You’ll need it.”\n\nI stayed wary but sat down. The sushi looked… perfect. Fat slabs of fish, glossy rice, just enough wasabi. I grabbed a roll.\n\nAnd then came the *rattling* at the door.\n\nSomeone — something — was jiggling the doorknob.\n\nI ran over and slammed all the locks shut.\n\nCrater didn’t even look up. “It’s only delaying the inevitable,” he said. “They’ll get in sooner or later.”\n\nMy heart was pounding. “What *are* they?”\n\nCrater only shook his head.\n\nSome mix of courage and idiocy took over. I *unlocked* the door.\n\n“NO!” he shouted, but I’d already opened it a crack.\n\nWhat I saw outside wasn’t a person. It wasn’t *right.* Skin like blistered leather. A body shaped like it had been folded wrong.\n\nIt lunged.\n\nI slammed the door and ran to my room, barricading it with furniture. “That’s not going to work,” Crater’s voice came from behind me.\n\nI spun. “How did you—?”\n\n“They’re going to get through,” he said. “Might as well get it over with.”\n\n“Get WHAT over with?!”\n\nThe door cracked. Furniture buckled. A finger snaked through the splintered wood. Then a hand. Then a face.\n\nMisshapen. Eyes reflective like a cat’s.

One room in the whole house with working ghosts-for-vents.\n\nThere’s a painting on the wall of a stern white man in a plantation coat with a Bible in one hand and a cane in the other. Next to him, a little girl. Maybe five. Black. Light-skinned. Eyes like glacier water. Something about her looked familiar.\n\nIt hit me later when I saw the photo on the mantle in the living room. My great-grandmother Ruth.\n\nSame eyes.\n\nThat night, the hissing came back louder. And I swear, I heard chains. Not like dragging-on-the-ground chains. *Shaking*. Like something *angry* and rattling the past.\n\nGrandma came into my room at 3:00 a.m., looking calm as ever, in her satin bonnet and slippers.\n\n“You let air in. Now it knows you're here.”\n\n“I’m sorry—*what* knows I’m here?”\n\nShe sat on the edge of my bed like this was a casual Tuesday and said, “Your great-grandmother was the daughter of the man who built this house. She wasn’t supposed to exist. So when she did… he tried to lock the spirit away. In that room. But Ruth was the only one who could hold it back.”\n\n“And now?”\n\n“You’re the only one left with her eyes.”\n\nI swear on my Wi-Fi bill, I have *never* wanted to not be special more in my life.\n\nSo now, I’m apparently the family seal, the chosen trauma sponge. I’m not allowed to leave the house for more than three days without something “leaking.” I have to say a blessing every Thursday at sundown and keep *cornbread* in the kitchen window “to keep it fed.”\n\nNot even joking. Ghosts out here snacking.\n\nAnd if you're wondering why we don't just sell the land? Ha. Zillow won't touch it.

A small, humble place that time, with all its wiles and whims, time had mercifully forgotten.\n\nIt was a place where hope was a shared belonging—where children had futures, parents had security, and everyone knew each other’s names.\n\nThe main street ran through the heart of the town like a life—giving river—connecting the antique shops, brick houses, and quiet diners together like tranquil streams. The bells of the church rang with a solemn peace that filled the hearts of those who heard. The bakery opened at 5 a.m. sharp, and the postman waved hello to the shopkeeper at noon every day, like clockwork.\n\nI myself have been happy here in my 32 years of life. I grew up here and was content to die here when my time had come. This place felt like home to me. The very ivy that caressed the red brick walls of the houses in my neighborhood had latched themselves onto my soul and rooted my being here. \n\nMy father, like his father and his before, was the proud owner of the town’s little bookshop—half bookstore, half antique store, smelling of cedar and dust and stories yet unread. It was his pride and joy and, when he passed, it was mine too. \n\nIronic that the place that gave me the most joy—felt the most like home—would be the birthplace of the destruction of all I loved.\n\nI can tell you exactly when it started. \n\nOn a drizzly afternoon, I took my place behind the counter of my beloved shop, like I had so many days before. It stood out to me like a spotlight—obscene in its presence, as if the world itself was forcing my eyes to see it. \n\nThat awful book, bound in the skin of a serpent.\n\nI knew every page of every book in that store— every crease and every fold. Not one had entered or exited these walls without my knowledge. And yet I didn’t know this one.\n\nIn my curiosity I made my fatal error. And like Adam, my blunder, born from an innocent curiosity, would damn the souls of many.\n\nThe first act was no more than strange. Beautiful, but strange in a way that sickened me to my core— like watching an explosion. I was seeing something I was never meant to, and I knew it.\n\nYet I yearned to read on. \n\nI flipped the small plastic sign that hung on the door— “Closed.” I had never done that before, and I didn’t know why I was doing it now, but I needed to.\n\nI spent the rest of that day tearing over the second act. It was unlike the first— unlike anything I had ever read before. I trembled with fear and the blood left my face. I was cold, feverish. But I didn’t stop until it was done.\n\n When I finished, I returned that beautiful abomination to its place on the shelf and went home, where I fell into a deep sleep. \n\nThat night, under a crescent moon, the wind blew wrong. It carried no scent of pine or chimney smoke. The lively breath of the nature that surrounded the town, tonight, was a sickly gasp. It bestowed its pestilence to us all.\n\nMy dream lasted a mere moment, and an eternity. \n\nI saw the lake of clouds, ever encroaching on the ruins of that great and terrible city, and the sibling suns that it swallowed whole. I witnessed the towers that hid behind the moons, and the black stars that voided out the sky. \n\nWorst—and greatest—of all, I saw his ivory visage.\nAnd in that moment, I knew: one day, I would never leave this place.\n\nBut I never could have imagined how.\n\nI was filled with an awesome dread— a sick amazement. How could something be so horrible and so wonderful at once?\n\nWhen I woke, the feeling hadn’t left me. It was more than I could bear— leaving me bedridden for 3 days.\n\nWhen again I could will myself back into life, back into the world outside, it wasn’t the same as I had left it. \n\nI observed the town around me— the faces I knew were all there. The smiles of my friends and neighbors all exactly as I remembered them. Only, they weren’t. They were pale like porcelain, and gaunt like the grave. \n\nThe books of the children that ran by were stamped with his sallow crest. The necklaces worn by the women bore it on pendants, golden and gleaming. The men muttered to me as I passed—low, reverent words. Awful, beautiful syllables I yet recognized.\n\nIt didn’t take long for us to be taken. Once his word had spread throughout the town, it was too late. The bearer of that pallid facade owns this place now, and all those in it.\n\nI don’t know how long it’s been— time has stretched like the shadows of the towers that now shroud us. \n\nThe town I knew is with him now, as are we. \n\nPeople don’t act as they once did— there are no more friendly greetings or smiling faces. In their place has fallen the same sickness. Lunacy and death have become our life. \n\nHis mad sickness has come over us like a plague— incurable and all consuming.\n\nThe main street, once the life of our small, quaint town, now points to the spires reverently. Many of the brick walls have taken a new shade of red, repainted by the blood of their residents. The church did not come with us. It’s the last thing that gives me any hope or joy— the thought that those beautiful bells are still ringing in that place, so far away from here.\n\nIt is a place where madness is a shared belonging. Those left tremble at his presence— some in fear, others even in joyful obedience. Their faces are an uncanny imitation of his visor, ghostlike in their complexion. \n\nOnce, in the heart of Pennsylvania, there was a town. But that place is gone now. \n\nAs for me, he has a purpose. It’s why you’re reading this now.\n\nHe’s allowed me to send this back—a final message to my home from me, and an invitation from him.\n\nOr perhaps, rather, a warning.\n\nI don’t think he asks.\n\nThe Yellow Sign is a binding seal. If you’ve read this far, I’m sure I will one day meet you. And together, we’ll wander the ruins of the great city for eternity—sprayed by the icy wind of the cloudy lake, beneath the black stars that drink the sky."},"44":{"title":"My mother worshiped ild forgotten gods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfdts8\/my_mother_worshiped_ild_forgotten_gods\/","flair":"Series","author":"wenti200","selftext":"Before I begin I need to tell you a little about my mother and the deities she worships—their ancient gods from ages beyond the first dawn when the was nothing but the void.

She tried any means of mystic to shamans but to no effect until she met what then seemed to be my father. He showed her a ritual that could bring life and make anyone fertile but at a cost.

Having given up hope my mother didn't hear the words of my soon-to-be father and in the unholy union, they conceived a child a baby girl they called Elspeth…\n\nMy mother tried to raise me as any child. She braided ribbons into my hair and taught me old songs sung in the language of her people—the one she said even the gods forgot.

But sometimes, when she thought I wasn’t looking, I’d catch her staring at me as though she didn’t recognise the child in front of her.\n\nLike I was something else.\n\nShe kept a journal. I wasn’t supposed to read it, but I did—years later, hidden in the attic, wrapped in red silk. Pages and pages of confessions: how she felt hollow after the ritual. How her dreams bled into waking life. How she thought something followed her home.\n\nShe wrote of waking in the night to find me standing at the foot of her bed, eyes wide open, whispering in a voice that wasn’t mine. She wrote of dead birds found on the windowsill. Of the dog that barked at nothing until its heart gave out.\n\nBut she loved me. I know she did.

Almost kind.\n\nBut it chilled me to the bone.\n\n\n“Alright come on Mara that's enough that  story for you.” My mother said as she reached over and snapped the book shut from my hands.\n\n“You got a busy day missy” she said smirking a flicker came from her eyes as the candlelight flickered sending shadows across the room.\n\n“Mother you know I don't want to” I huffed with disgruntled as turned over facing my face away from her. I heard her sighing as she closed the door with a quiet click \n“Mother, you know I don’t want to,” I huffed, pulling the blanket up and turning away from her, facing the wall. I heard her sigh, long and low, then the soft click of the door closing behind her.\n\nI waited. One minute. Two. The floor creaked faintly beyond the door, then silence.\n\nI sat up.\n\nThe book still lay at the foot of my bed, its crimson cover peeking from beneath the folds of the blanket. I glanced at the door.\n\nShe never let me finish it. Never let me ask questions.\n\nTonight, something was different.\n\nI slipped from the bed, careful to avoid the groaning floorboard near the dresser. My feet were bare. Cold. The candle still burned on the windowsill, the flame wavering as though nervous. I crept to the hallway, holding my breath, and moved toward the end—toward her room.\n\nThe door was ajar.\n\nI paused just outside, heart beating loud in my ears, and leaned in.\n\nShe was kneeling.\n\nAt first, I thought she was praying. Her back was to me, long hair loose down her spine, trembling shoulders lit by the glow of a dozen candles flickering across the room. But then I heard her voice.\n\nNot praying.\n\nChanting.\n\nA language I didn’t recognize—harsh, wet syllables that clung to the walls like cobwebs. The sound of them made my skin crawl. It was like something old and angry had been waiting to be spoken again.\n\nHer hands were raised, fingers twitching in sharp, unnatural gestures. At her feet lay a small bowl, filled with something dark and steaming. Symbols had been scrawled around it in chalk—or something thicker. Something red.\n\n“Mama?” I whispered, voice catching in my throat.\n\nShe didn’t stop. She didn’t turn. The chant grew louder. Urgent. The candles flared, their flames stretching tall and thin like they were reaching for something unseen.\n\nSomething was there. I couldn’t see it, not exactly—but I felt it. Heavy and wrong. Like a second presence in the room that hadn’t come through the door.\n\nMy mother gasped, her body jerking forward, hands gripping the edge of the bowl. Her voice faltered.\n\nThen the room went still.\n\nSo still I thought the world had stopped.\n\nAnd then—slowly—she turned her head.\n\nHer eyes were black.\n\nNot dark.\n\nBlack.\n\n“Go back to bed, Mara,” she said, voice calm. Too calm. As if nothing had happened. As if I hadn’t just seen what I saw.\n\n“But—”\n\n“Now.”\n\nAnd I ran."},"45":{"title":"My daughter keeps asking about the man in the floorboards.

Just me and my daughter, Ivy. It’s not much, but it’s ours. Fifth floor, decent view, rent just barely affordable. The building is old, with creaky pipes and paper-thin walls, but it's quiet and no one bothers us.\n\nIvy is four. She’s bright and weird in the best way. Loves bugs, talks to stuffed animals like they’re old friends, invents strange stories on the fly. I’ve always encouraged her imagination. Kids need that. Especially after what we’ve been through.\n\nAt first, it was just normal play. She’d crawl on the floor with her dolls, press her ear to the wood like she was listening for something. I asked her once what she was doing, and she told me, “He talks funny when he’s sleepy.”\n\nI didn’t think much of it. Thought she was mimicking a TV character or something.\n\nA few days later, while brushing her teeth, she pointed to the floor and asked if I could “tell the man to stop watching her.”\n\nI froze. Not scared. Just thrown.\n\n“What man?” I asked.\n\nShe pointed to the floor again. “The one who lives under the wood.”\n\nI gave her a confused smile. “Honey, there’s nobody under there. We’re on the fifth floor, remember?”\n\nShe didn’t respond. Just rinsed and spat like nothing happened.\n\nThat night, I checked the floor while she slept. The boards were dusty but solid. No gaps. No loose panels. Still, I knelt down and tapped a few spots. Hollow, but not unusual. Old floors always sound like that.\n\nOver the next week, Ivy started avoiding the hallway. She would step around specific boards like they were hot. She stopped sleeping in her bed and would sneak into mine without saying a word. When I asked her why, she’d just whisper, “He gets louder at night.”\n\nI started keeping the TV on while she fell asleep. White noise, comfort. Still, I’d catch her glancing toward the floor in the middle of a show. Like she was waiting for something.\n\nThen, two nights ago, I woke to a loud pop, like a board snapping under weight.\n\nI rushed to her room. She was sitting upright in bed, wide-eyed, staring at the floor. I asked what happened. She pointed to a spot near the corner of the room.\n\nOne of the floorboards was slightly raised. Barely noticeable. But it hadn’t been like that before.\n\nI pressed down on it. It gave a little, like something beneath had pushed upward.\n\n“Did you drop something under there?” I asked.\n\nIvy didn’t answer. She just whispered, “You touched his door.”\n\nLast night, I barely slept. Every creak of the building made me tense. I turned on every light. Sat in the living room until morning.\n\nThis morning, I went to the kitchen to make coffee and found a piece of paper tucked behind the cereal box. Ivy's drawing. Crayon on lined notebook paper. A stick figure girl stood in a square room. Beneath her feet, a black figure was drawn in a pit of jagged lines, reaching upward with arms too long for its body.\n\nIn the corner of the drawing was a sentence, written in shaky, childish letters:\n\n“He said you shouldn’t have touched his door.”\n\nI’m not sure if I’m more afraid that Ivy drew it.\n\nOr that she didn't."},"46":{"title":"Our first date started in a mall.

We had just finished showering in one of the mall’s many bizarre fountains—this one had a marble statue of the Greek mathematician Euclid. He was holding an abacus which sprayed [water](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke1l3i\/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen\/).\n\n“Live here? In the **infinite mall**? Are you joking?”\n\n“I know it's not ideal,” Rav dried his beard, he hadn’t shaved since we got stuck. “But so far it's been able to supply everything we need. Food, clothes, water.”\n\n“Rav, no. I can’t even picture it as a joke. Living here would be awful.”\n\n“It’s just a hypothetical question. Would it be so awful?”\n\nI changed into my cargo pants and flannel. We often brought up philosophical debates, it was a nice way to make it feel like we were still in school. But I couldn’t abide by this one.\n\n“Even as a hypothetical, it's a no. I miss living on Earth. I want people to be around me again. Family, friends, anyone. I want normalcy.”\n\n“For sure, for sure, and I would obviously *rather* have that. But you can at least still have *some* of things via the internet.” He pointed to the iPad on our backpacks.\n\nHe wasn't wrong. Despite being trapped in this bizarre dimension, our cell phones still had service. I could still message my parents and even my friends. I could even technically be taking online courses right now.\n\n“Maybe if we accepted that we’re sort of *castaways* inside this infinite mall—” Rav put on his hiking pants and shirt, “—we could relax our constant need to move. And just focus on… you know, ourselves.”\n\n“Rav.” I grabbed an elastic band and used it as a scrunchie, collecting the hair away from my face. “I’ll focus on myself, once we find a way out of here. I’m not spending the rest of my life trapped in this mall. That’s ridiculous.”\n\nI pointed at Euclid’s marble, dour-looking face.\n\n“I am *not* getting used to this.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut that conversation stuck with me. \n\nWeeks passed. Rav and I explored the dark hallways of the ever-expanding *City Center Mall* and kept finding more of the usual fare: food courts, clothing stores, nail salons, art shops, toy stores…\n\nSome of the mall plazas were nicer than others. Some had indoor gardens full of flowers. One even featured a small pool across from a martini bar.\n\n*Would it be that bad if we settled down in one of these places? For A week or longer?* \n\nEach day, our focus was to explore further, to search for an exit, which I knew was the right approach, but more and more… I was starting to see Rav’s point.\n\nThe goal had been to reach the part of the mall that was poorly rendered. Everyone in our group chat thought the same thing: ‘*somewhere on the disintegrating fringes there will be an exit!’* \n\nBut we had found those fringes. And there was no exit.\n\nWe came across *Wolmort’s, Brgr Kngs,* and ∀pple stores full of warped iPhones and chairs fused with ceiling lamps. But there weren't any real exits inside these places.\n\nInstead there were cracks within walls oozing more of that same silver *non-material* that killed Prof Ed. Our brightest minds from Groups B and C would try new approaches to interacting with the silver ooze. And those same minds would attempt to inscribe various math ‘*exit’* formulas onto the ooze as well.\n\nNothing yielded results.\n\nThe non-matter killed anyone who dared touch it, and the only math equation that actually worked was the one for duplication (which Rav and I had forbidden each other to use).\n\nIt's as if the harder we all tried, the *less* likely we were to find an exit.\n\nThe possibility of escape felt like it was approaching closer and closer to zero.\n\nWe had travelled over 140 miles away from the center, almost three full months of perpetual walking.\n\n I was ready for that week off.\n\nI was ready for respite.\n\nAnd then, we found it.\n\n*The library.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was massive. \n\nIt took up the entire north wall of the mall plaza Rav and I entered. Instead of several floors of commercial mannequins and furniture staring back at us, we could see window after window full of mahogany bookshelves, shiny wooden globes, and reading desks.\n\nThere were actual *lights inside* too. \n\nNot some awful ceiling fluorescents or lamps, but actual *candles.*\n\nWe entered slowly and cautiously, soaking in the architecture that looked elegantly carved from maybe two centuries ago. The word “Victorian” came to mind.\n\nSplinter groups B and C were actually the first to discover the libraries. In fact, it was from their encouragement that we ventured further out and discovered ours. \n\nIt appeared that there was perhaps a colossal, continuous **Library Ring** around the mall on all sides (at around the 155 mile radius mark).\n\nOur splinter groups had just reached different sides of it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRav and I ate our lunch in a reading area next to the library’s foyer. It felt so nice to be seated in a hand-carved, warmly lit room surrounded by natural wood hues. \n\nThere was even a small fireplace at one end, keeping the temperature cozy.\n\nSomehow, all of the flames were perpetual. The candles were everlasting and *brighter* than ordinary candles, illuminating large hand-painted portraits throughout the walls. \n\nJust when we thought the mall would go on forever, we encountered this strange, 18th century relic building.\n\n*Was it going to be another 155 miles of library now?* \n\n*What did it mean about this dimension’s layout?* \n\nRav and I excitedly pointed with our sandwiches, discussing the possibilities. I accidentally sent a large piece of salami flying to the floor—and that’s when I heard someone clear their throat.\n\n\"Und wer sind Sie?“\n\nOur conversation froze. Rav and I turned to see a tiny pair of tiny spectacles staring at us. Tiny spectacles sitting on the nose of a slightly greying, mustachioed man with a pipe clenched in his mouth. He leaned against the doorframe, eying us suspiciously.\n\nRav spoke first. “Uhh… excuse me?”\n\nThe man blew a small puff of coal-black smoke “Ah. English. I see.” \n\nHis tiny, perfectly circular glasses made the rest of his head look overly large. His dark, stygian suit matched the black leather shoes which strode towards us calmly.\n\n“Willkommen. I am Schrödinger. And you are?”\n\nWe both put down our sandwiches.\n\n“Ermm… I’m Claudia.”\n\n“I’m Rav...”\n\nHe stared at our massive camping backpacks that lay haphazardly on the floor. Then he inspected our 7-Eleven sandwiches as if they were alien creatures.\n\n“You wear strange uniforms.” He gestured to our hiking clothes. “Not academics, surely?”\n\nNeither Rav nor I knew where to start.\n\n“Uh.. well technically, we both are students, yes.”\n\nSchrödinger looked directly at my face and puffed from his pipe. “Forgive me, Fräulein but intellectual pursuits are a little ill-suited to feminine temperaments. Don’t you think?”\n\n“I... ” words tripped on themselves in my throat. “What…?”\n\nThen the man pointed his pipe at Rav. “And you, a Hindu. I’ve studied some Oriental metaphysics too. Is that what you used to arrive here?”\n\nNeither of us knew how to react. Eventually, Rav gave his head a shake. “Wait a minute. … Are you *the* Schrödinger? Erwin Schrödinger?”\n\nThe man took a step back and exhaled a large puff of black.  “I am the one asking questions. How did you arrive?”\n\nRav and I stood up from the table. The vibe felt pretty threatening.\n\n“We got here some three months ago.” I pointed outside the window beside us, out towards the darkness. “We walked in. From the mall.”  \n\n“*Mall*?” It was like he had never heard the word before. He gestured to the front entrance nearby. “You came from *there*?”\n\n“Yes. Uh. From the steps outside?”\n\n“You’re telling me…”  Schrödinger held his pipe above his head, as if nursing a headache“...You *strolled up* the steps and entered *Der Mathemandelsring* without an invitation?” \n\nRav scratched his neck. “I mean… we were forced into here. It was kind of against our will, we don’t mean any—”\n\n“—Only inducted theoreticians may grace these halls!” Schrödinger pointed with his pipe accusingly. “This is not some luncheon hall.”\n\nRav shot me a worried look. \n\n“Sorry, sorry. We are both students.” He quickly grabbed one of our napkins and wiped our crumbs off the parlor table. “We were just looking for a dining area. I’m a theoretician too though. I study Applied Math.”\n\nSchrödinger adjusted his glasses—they now reflected the fireplace’s flames.\n\n“You? A theoretician?”\n\n“Yes.” \n\n“Who brought you? Von Neumann?”\n\n“No. I… We brought ourselves?”\n\nSchrödinger shook his head. I could see his face was getting flush. “We do not allow for loitering drifters here.”\n\n“But hold on…” Rav unfolded a piece of paper from his pants. It was our own duplication formula (to be used in emergencies only). He held out the complex equation as evidence.\n\n“I can read all of this. In fact, I wrote all of this. I’m a mathematician too.”\n\nSchrödinger took a step towards us, and  examined the creased paper.\n\n*“We could also just leave,”* I whispered to Rav.\n\nRav squeezed my hand back.\n\n“An interesting solution to *Banach-Tarski,”* Schrödinger tapped at the page. “So you know a bit of math.”\n\n“I do.” Rav smiled, trying to appear cooperative. “In fact, I would love to learn more. We’ve been trying to find a particular formula on our journey. An escape solution. Maybe this library could be of some use to—”\n\n“—And since you have not been properly inducted upon your arrival here—then *I* shall be your officiant.” Schrödinger exhaled a large dark puff at our faces.\n\nHe went to unfurl an enormous scroll from the ceiling, which was covered in dense math.\n\n“*Der Mathemandelsring* is a sacred place. You are familiar with the entrance exam, no doubt.”\n\nSchrödinger produced a fountain pen and began to add Greek letters on the giant paper. His wrist whipped back and forth, ending with a flourish for the final stroke.\n\nThe air stirred with reverberation. \n\nA gigantic wooden crate appeared beside Schrödinger. A large brown box.\n\n“Using all of the Arithmancy at your disposal, you must *overcome my equation,* young applicant.”\n\n“Sure…” Rav looked at me, holding his paper out and grabbed a marker from his pocket. “So this is like a math test?”\n\nSchrödinger used his pipe to tap the side of the large box.\n\n“Surely you’ve heard of my *cat.”*\n\nThe front wall of the box fell forward, revealing a massive black *jaguar.* It awoke from a long-coiled slumber.\n\nAdrenaline hit me from the mere sight of the animal. It was enormous. \n\nThe cat yawned and stepped out of the box, exposing large, shining fangs. Its yellow eyes darted between Rav and myself. A low rumble came from its throat.\n\n“Woah. What? This *cat* is your test?” Rav backed away,\n\n“Yes.” Schrödinger resumed smoking his pipe. His puffs stretched into long black whisps which appeared to flow *into* the cat.\n\n“Your exam begins now.” \n\nThe cat hissed, and pounced toward us.\n\nWe scurried behind a reading desk. \n\nThe whole place had rows of reading desks like a classroom, but they weren't very tall, or obstructive. \n\nWe watched rather helplessly, as the jaguar leapt from desk to desk and flanked us.\n\n“Her name is Vanta.” Schrödinger followed.\n\nThe car leapt onto a desk closer to us. For a split second, I saw the cat fall onto its neck in a brutal misstep. But then that reality flickered away. The cat instead glared ferociously atop the nearby desk. \n\nRav reached into his breast pocket and pulled out the revolver. “Back away! Back!”\n\nAs soon as gun’s barrel aimed at the cat, she hopped away and slinked behind a desk.\n\n*She’s seen guns before.* \n\n“Quick! Now’s our chance!” I pulled Rav. We scrambled out a side exit.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith the door slammed shut, we found ourselves inside a massive library hall. Bookshelves reached almost two stories high. Tall rolling ladders installed everywhere. We ran down the closest aisle, carefully looking over our shoulders\n\n“Your Glock handy?” Rav asked.\n\nI could feel the small pistol’s weight shuffle under my flannel. I had really hoped I wasn't going to have to use it … but this was life or death.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nWhen we reached the far end of the aisle, I pulled out the handgun, and undid the safety.\n\nNothing had followed behind us. But that didn’t mean shit. I remembered learning about cougars from camp once. Their paws were cushioned so you couldn’t hear them sneaking, and they'd stay low to the ground so you couldn’t see their shadow…\n\n“Okay,” Rav said, swallowing lumps. “If it's just the panther. I think we can take her. Don’t aim for the head, just the center mass. Body shots.”\n\nI nodded and watched the ceiling candelabras swing as something jumped from one to the other.\n\nThe cat was prowling atop the bookshelves.\n\n“Don’t rush.” Rav whispered. “Wait til she gets closer…” \n\nThe yellow eyes glinted, I could feel Vanta singling me out. She wanted to pounce down on the smaller, more vulnerable human. I lined up my iron sights, and tested holding the trigger…\n\n*BLAM!*\n\nThe top bookshelf exploded into splinters. \n\nThe cat slipped off and landed back-first onto the ground with a *CRACK!*  \n\nThen Vanta *flickered.* Suddenly she was standing upright, as if landing perfectly.\n\n“Get back!” Rav fired two rounds. The cat flickered out of existence again.\n\n The marble ground sparked from the bullets. \n\nThe cat reappeared, totally unharmed.\n\n“Oh good.” Rav said.\n\nVanta took a leap towards us. I closed my eyes and fired. \n\n*Rrreeeeooow!!”*\n\n*THUD!* The cat fell right before me, I could see her wince from a fresh bullet wound on her shoulder. She hissed and began to flicker in and out of existence like an old projector.\n\nMy gun followed her tail until she scampered behind another aisle.\n\n“How did you hit it?” Rav grabbed my hand. He dragged us back.\n\n“I don’t know! I just shut my eyes and… I don’t know!”\n\nWe backed up a small set of steps.\n\n“Shut your eyes?... “ Rav squinted, digging around his memory. “Of course!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Observer effect!”\n\nWe ran into the open center of the library where we could see all the bookshelf aisles behind us. We both scanned for any signs of the predator.\n\n“Schrödinger’s Cat is both alive and dead,\" Rav said. \"She won’t be just one or the other until someone observes her — until we collapse her quantum state.”\n\n“But we *have* been observing her. In fact, there she is.” \n\nI pointed to a distant bookshelf labelled *Geographia,* where black shadow was prowling behind book spines.\n\n“Yes, and because we keep watching her, I think her “alive” state is able to recrystallize over and over…\n\n“So she's …  permanently alive?”\n\n“As long as we keep looking at her.”\n\nHer head poked out one of the aisles. Her whiskers rose up as she *snarled.*  Then she pulled back into the shadows and crawled away.\n\n“I think if we close our eyes while delivering the killing blow … then she might actually stay dead.”\n\nI had trouble keeping a straight face. \n\n“We’re supposed to kill this cat … without looking at it?”\n\n“Yes. And we can’t look at the remains either.”\n\nWe heard the scrape of her feet around the edges of the library. She was running outside of visibility, circling around the bookshelves behind us.\n\n“Well we sure can’t see her now!”\n\n“Yes. But because she was last seen alive, she will stay alive.”\n\nHer running quickened, I saw her tail whip behind a series of antique earth globes. Each one spun as she bolted past them.\n\n“Rav. This is fucked!”\n\n“Here, grab.” \n\nHe ripped out a page from a book on a shelf.\n\nStill aiming my gun, I grabbed the page he gave me. It was a map of some lake.\n\n“Once the cat comes close. Hold the page out in front of you.” He demonstrated, holding another page against his eyes.\n\nI briefly did the same. The parchment was thin enough for me to barely see the outline of objects ahead of me. “If you can’t see her when you shoot her, she’ll stay dead.”\n\n“I see.” I said. And then thought: *this if fucked.*\n\nWe both followed the creaks of the cat as she slithered between bookshelves. She would growl, throwing her voice and bouncing it off the walls behind us. She knew what she was doing.\n\nWe backed up to a large reception-looking desk which Rav helped me stand on top of. I would cover us from higher ground. Rav stuck to the floor.\n\n“Psst!” Rav pointed at an antique book cart, loaded with books. I saw it jostle for a second. \n\nThen it startled to travel in our direction\n\n“What the…”\n\nBehind the rolling iron wheels, I saw a pair of paws. *This cat was smarter than I thought.* Vanta pushed the cart in our direction and came prowling behind it for cover.\n\n“Here we go.” Rav ran to one side of the wheels. “Cover me!”\n\nI held my gun steady.\n\nBriefly, I tried lifting Rav’s paper over my eyes. But it was too opaque at this distance. I threw it away. \n\nThen the cat leaped out. \n\nRav squeezed his eyes and fired. \n\nThe cat howled with injury. She began to flicker. \n\nThen the cat flickered her wounds away, and stared at me, *the last observer.*\n\n“Fuck!” I lined up my shot and fired.\n\nI shut my eyes and fired twice more.\n\n“Shit!” I said.\n\n“What?!”\n\n“I think I got it!”\n\n“Coming back!”\n\n“Coming back?”\n\n“Running towards you!”\n\n“Who? The cat?”\n\n“No, me!\n\n“Can I open my eyes?”\n\n“No!”\n\nIn what might have been the longest moment of my life, I kept my eyes closed and his behind the  desk.\n\nI heard Rav’s footsteps clomp towards me, and I *thought* I heard the scampering of paws.\n\n“Is it behind you!?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\n“I hear its paws!”\n\n“No! Claudia, *do not* look this way!”\n\nI covered my face, and cradled myself, holding my breath. Rav’s arms found me and spun me to face the wall.\n\n“You can open your eyes now, just don’t look behind us.”\n\nRav and I were both behind the wooden desk and staring at a shelf of books.\n\n“Did you see it die?” I asked him.\n\n\"I did. But then you shot it?”\n\nI swallowed a guilty rock. “I think I was still ‘observing’ it. So I fired again.”\n\n“So did *you* kill it?”\n\n“I don’t know. Did it follow you?”“No. I didn’t sense anything.”\n\n“But I heard some scampering.”\n\n“Are you sure it wasn’t me?”\n\n“I don’t know. Let’s just… wait.”\n\nAnd wait we did, for what felt like an eternity. We held each other, facing the wall, not looking back, as if we were Orpheus and Eurydice. I kept imagining the stealthy Jaguar creeping up behind us, waiting for the perfect moment to leap onto our heads.\n\nBut it never came.\n\nAfter we counted two hundred Mississippi's, Rav stood up and carefully left our hiding spot.\n\nHe lifted his arms and walked out backwards towards the center. Nothing attacked him.\n\nI sensed a powerfully strong tobacco-smell mixed with burning tar. \n\nThen came a scoff.\n\n“Well I guess that's one way to do it. You’ve vanquished Vanta.”\n\nRav froze in his steps. I saw him tentatively turn his head.\n\n“Yes. You may both look this way. I've boxed her up.\n\nWith the utmost hesitancy I turned around to see Schrödinger standing between the book cart and a wooden box that appeared on his left.\n\nHis pipe was clenched in his teeth. His arms were crossed brusquely against his charcoal three piece suit.\n\n“You were supposed to use *Arithmancy*. And yet you did not use a single formula. What a shame.”\n\nRav wiped a pool of accrued sweat from his forehead. “What? I thought we just had to overcome your… cat.”\n\n“Anyone can shoot an animal with a boorish revolver. What a pathetic aptitude you’ve shown.”\n\nRav scratched his beard. He unfolded our copy equation from his pocket once more. “I can still duplicate myself if you want. We understand how math works in this worl—”\n\n“—No, it's too late now.” Schrödinger waved his hand. “The test is over. You have failed to demonstrate any mathematical ability.”\n\n“No. Please.” Rav waved his hands until they came together in a small prayer. “There's got to be another way. Another chance.”\n\n“No second chances. Your exam is a failure. You must leave.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBecause of his ability to summon *boxes of jaguars*, we didn't push our luck with Schrödinger.\n\nHe very cordially guided us towards the entrance we came through.\n\nAlthough definitely a little saddened that we couldn't see more of the **Library Ring,** I was just happy to leave with our lives.\n\n“This door will soon become locked for you, and you may never enter again.” Schrödinger pointed at the exit foyer. “Respect the rules of *Der Mathemandelsring*”\n\nRav seemed to acquiesce with a glum nod.\n\nWhen we opened the door and looked outside, I could see that the oblique darkness of the mall was gone. Instead, we saw overcast clouds over a *well-manicured lawn?*\n\n“Wait what…” I said, astounded. “Where are we?”\n\nSchrödinger furrowed his brow. “ Fraulein, that is outside. And that is where you will go.”\n\n“But this isn't where we were before.” Rav stared with wide eyes. “Is this… are we in America?”\n\nFor some reason this really made Schrödinger laugh. His mustache danced a little on his face.  His yellow teeth shone. ”No, you are not in *America.* And you are not allowed back inside. Auf Vederzen.”\n\nHe waved at us until we left. The door was shut tight, I could hear locks being put in place. \n\nThere was a cobblestone road up to this library, and I could see two old horse-drawn carriages parked around a sort of thoroughfare. Birds flew above us, cawing and landing on distant trees. \n\nIt was the widest open space we had seen in months. \n\n“Where are we?”\n\nI checked my phone. \n\nI still had reception.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEveryone was dressed in breeches and dresses, all woven from wool and linen. \n\nThey must have been groundskeepers or landscapers part of the estate, they all eyed us with open curiosity, but kept their distance.\n\nWe were too afraid to talk to anyone at first, so we walked out a bit further and watched the **Library Ring** shrink behind us. Though out here, it was no longer a ring at all. Just a large building, made of stone and glass windows. You could mistake it for an old church.\n\nWalking out further, we came across something hard to grasp at first. It honestly felt like I was looking at a picture from a history book. \n\nIt was an old European village.\n\nI saw an assembly of cottages, cobble roads, dogs and children running about, hooting and hollering as if they were re-enacting a Charles Dickens novel. There was even a bell-tower in the distance.\n\n*“And whose might you be?”*\n\nIt was a boy. He came to us running, rolling a metal wheel with a stick like it was the best thing in the world. *“Youse just came from the library, eh?”*\n\nRav and I both turned to each other and took a deep breath.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe village was called **Yore.** \n\nAt first, everyone stayed away from us, which made it awkward. They would gawk at our clothes, whisper to each other, and never return our waves of hello. It’s like they thought we were ghosts or something.\n\nBut in a few short hours, the village children kept visiting us, and when the fact spread that *we came from the library,* everyone's opinion quickly changed.\n\nWe were given proper handshakes, and treated as ‘educated aristocrats’.\n\n“The library always brings prosperity.” A man pulling a cow said.\n\nThey gave us a warm meal at the town tavern, and allowed us to stay at the local inn, where we got our own dedicated room. I offered them a Bulgari necklace as payment which they happily accepted. \n\n“Please, stay as long as you need, honorable librarians.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBy day two, we had gotten to know the barkeeper downstairs, who introduced us to the sheriff across the street, who took us to visit several farmers down the road, who showed us where we could harvest fresh vegetables for ourselves. \n\nThere was an abundance of crops this year.\n\nEveryone was astonishingly nice, no one seemed all that bothered by the mud caked on their roads, or the pallid greyness of the sky … things just were as they were.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOur days in town move by fast, and I had to be selective with how often I turned on my phone to record these entries.\n\nOn our third day, Rav and I went for a trek outside the town, just to get a sense of the landscape. We had planned to finish some of the last of our snacks from the mall on a long hike.\n\nWe had barely walked a mile out, when we came across the same old library we left the previous day. And then past the library, we *looped* back into the town.\n\nNo matter what direction we went into, the fields full of ankle-high grass would always send us back to **Yore**.\n\nIt’s like we were inside some kind of enclosed universe.\n\nWhen Rav and I made this discovery, we both sat down in the grass field.\n\nWe held each other. And teared up. \n\nThere were no words. But we both felt the same kind of sadness.\n\nWe still were not free.\n\nWe were inside something even more miniature than the mall.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOur batteries were running low, and we knew we couldn’t recharge them anywhere here. \n\nWe sent abrupt farewells to any of our friends and family still communicating via our phones. And we sent farewells to our group chat with splinter Groups B and C (though they both had both gone unresponsive after entering the Library Ring).\n\nMaybe there was still some specific equation that could still get us out. \n\nMaybe there was a math test we could take to try and get back in the Library…\n\nBut somehow both Rav and I could sense we were officially *very* far from home. \n\nWherever we were. We were going to be here for a while.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, we camped out in the field.\n\nThere weren’t any stars that came out at night, the low-hanging grey cloud appeared to be a perpetual feature, but nonetheless, we laid in the grass and said goodbye to our old lives.\n\nThe all-dark sky slowly swallowed away our past.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut, just like with everything, time passes. Emotions wane. After a week, we learned that **Yore** was *not* like the mall. \n\nWe found ourselves sitting in at the town chapel each morning, just like everyone else, taking comfort in the feeling of being around living people.\n\nWhereas the **infinite mall** had been dead, and soul-sucking, **Yore** was at least alive, moving, and breathing.\n\nRav and I joined the group of farmers and helped with the crops. \n\nWe were given proper, rancher clothes, and got down on our knees and palms, digging up the potatoes by hand. \n\nWe even helped peel and cook them at the town hall kitchen. There was a communal dinner every night.\n\nIt felt a little disingenuous to be trying to distract ourselves like this. Rav and I both knew the lives we had before. Our former dream of escape…\n\nBut the more we accepted that this could just be a prolonged break—A prolonged ‘vacation’ for ourselves—the easier it was to embrace life as it was now.\n\nWe both longed for some inner peace.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\\*\\*\\*  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMany months have passed since settling in **Yore.**\n\nThis digital version of my journal will have to be laid to rest.\n\nI’ve used this as a historical record for our time in the mall, but it's since evolved into my own diary of events which I’m writing on paper now.\n\nI’m sending these words while I still have bars on my phone, while using up the final juice of my last spare battery.\n\nTo whomever finds this story, you should know that Rav and I are perfectly content here. \n\nJust yesterday we had joined a crew of landscapers tidying up the grass around the sacred library. We were pulling weeds outside the thoroughfare when a boy beside us pointed at the library’s front door.\n\nIt had opened briefly to let out some black smoke, then closed again within a moment.\n\nRav and I watched the door. For a moment we even contemplated rushing at the latch with our spades and rake in an effort to try and pry it open.\n\nBut then the urge passed.\n\nRav offered me some berries he’d collected from a copse nearby. They were juice and sweet. “Forget the Library, forget the mathematicians. Our lives are our own now.”\n\nA warm breeze filtered through my hair\n\nI held his hand and gave it a squeeze. *“Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not.”*\n\n“And what philosopher is that? “\n\n“Epicurus” I said.\n\n“Is he the one who loved food?”\n\n“No, that is actually a misattribution. He liked food but only as a simple pleasure, not as an indulgent luxury.”\n\nRav ate a berry. “Right. So it sounds like he would definitely be approving of our situation right now.”\n\nI thought about what other Greek philosophers might say about our current circumstances. *Were we inside some kind of Plato's cave? Were we just deluding ourselves to stay sane?...*\n\nI brushed some dirt off my pants and gave a long exhale.\n\n“I don't care what the philosophers think. I have you. I'm happy with you.”\n\nHe looked at me carefully, as if to check if I was joking. \n\n“You mean you're still not sick of our very long first date?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\nWe both kissed.\n\nAt some point later we’d find a way back into the library. But not for now. Not anytime soon.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter calling it a day, we went back to the village.\n\nThey were putting on a play in the town square that afternoon. A community theater rendition of *Hamlet*. We were both excited to see how they would pull off the *“to be or not to be’*’ scene. \n\n“You think they'll use an actual skull?” Rav asked.\n\n“Even if they do…” I squeezed his hand. “...

Not the content.\nBut the feeling.\n\nIt’s that strange sense of déjà vu. The one you can’t shake, no matter how hard you try.\nLike you’ve seen this before, heard it before, even though you know, deep down, you haven’t.\nIs it the text itself that pulls at something inside you? Or is it the way these words seem to tug at the edges of your mind?\n\nIt’s in the quiet moments. Or when you look out of a window, staring at the world passing by—just long enough for time to slip through your fingers.\nThe ones when you don’t expect anything to happen.\nAnd yet, something does. A subtle shift. An almost imperceptible change in the air. A brief pause, and then… nothing. Or maybe it’s something, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.\n\nMaybe you’ve stopped reading for a moment, thinking. The words seem to blur for a second, and then you snap back. Your brain stopped working for a fraction of a second. I know it’s confusing. You feel it, don’t you? That little interruption, like a skip in a song that you can’t quite catch.\n\nBut here’s the thing:\nThe key was never hidden in the text. It’s not in the obvious places.\nIt never was. Maybe there isn't a key. Or maybe there is, but it’s not what you think it is.\n\nIf there is a key, you’ll find it. Because you got here.\nYou found your way into this space. Not by chance, but by something else.\nSomething… familiar. A whisper, perhaps? A push from some part of your mind you didn’t even realize was there?\nDoesn't it feel like you're on the verge of something? Something you can’t describe, yet it tugs at you, like the sensation of forgetting a dream.\nBut you're here.\n\nAnd when you find it—when you finally put the pieces together—it’ll all click into place. You’ll understand why it was always there, hidden in the background. Why you didn’t notice it before.\n\nBut don’t rush. Let it come to you.\nThere’s no hurry. The answer isn’t running away. It’s waiting for you. In the spaces between the pixels on your screen, in the silence before the next sentence.\nYou don’t need to look for it. You don’t need to strain to see it.\n\nOnce you find what you’re looking for, everything will make sense.\nBut the trick is that you won’t realize it’s happened until it’s already done. It will feel like a moment of clarity, but it will come as quietly as the wind. You might think, “It was always here, wasn’t it?” But you won’t fully grasp it until the right moment.\n\nThat moment is coming. It’s closer than you think.\nSo, take your time. Let it come naturally.\nThe answer has always been within reach. All along.\n\nIt’s strange, isn’t it? How we never notice the things that matter most until they’ve passed us by.\nBut this time—this time, you won’t miss it.\nYou’ll see it. You’ll understand it.

No one would believe me anyway—not without seeing what I saw, hearing what I heard. But lately, something’s been humming in the back of my skull, like a signal waiting to be answered. I need to get this out before it gets worse.\n\nIt started with a hum.\n\nI live alone on the outskirts of a dying town in northern Arizona. Closest neighbor is five miles off. That’s how I like it—quiet, undisturbed. I’m a night owl by habit, always fiddling with old ham radios in my shed, scanning through static like I might tune into God.\n\nThat night, it wasn’t God.\n\nAround 2:13 AM, the static on my receiver snapped into something rhythmic. A pulse. Soft at first. Then louder. Then words. Not English. Not anything I knew. Just this garbled voice repeating something, glitching like a scratched CD: “Ek-sha… tik-ra… ek-sha… tik-ra…”\n\nI froze. The signal wasn’t bouncing off anything local. I had the gear to tell—it was straight down from the sky. Direct.\n\nMy shed lights flickered. My radio shorted out. And then… silence. No crickets. No wind. Not even the buzz of the power lines out by the road. It was like the world had inhaled and forgotten how to exhale.\n\nThen the sky cracked.\n\nNot thunder. Not lightning. The damn sky cracked. Split in a jagged line of light—like a broken mirror bleeding white. And from that fissure, something slid out.\n\nI couldn’t see it clearly at first—just movement. A shimmer, like oil on water, warping the air around it. Then it solidified. Tall. Lanky. Limbs too long, like someone stretched a human until it nearly broke.\n\nIt didn’t walk. It unfolded.\n\nI didn’t move. I couldn’t. Every instinct told me not to blink, not to breathe. I was prey, and that thing… it was the trap.\n\nIt looked at me. No eyes, but I knew it looked. I felt it inside my head, like a cold needle threading through memories. Childhood. My father’s funeral. The first time I kissed a girl. All of it, sifted through in seconds. It tasted me.\n\nThen it spoke—no mouth, no sound. Just a thought, loud as thunder and slick as oil.\n\n“Not ready.”\n\nI collapsed. I don’t remember falling, but I woke up in the dirt hours later, blood crusted around my nose and ears. My watch was frozen at 2:13 AM. The sky above was calm again. But there were footprints. Long, deep impressions—three-toed, like talons—leading away from the shed into the woods.\n\nI should’ve run. Should’ve called someone. But curiosity’s a disease.\n\nSo I followed.\n\nThe woods were wrong. Trees leaning the wrong way, shadows twitching when nothing moved. The deeper I went, the quieter it got, until even my own footsteps stopped making sound.\n\nI found the circle in a clearing. Burned into the earth. Charred, blackened, but pulsing faintly beneath the ash. In the center: a small, metallic cube. Smooth. No seams. No reflections. Just cold.\n\nI picked it up. That was my second mistake.\n\nThe moment my fingers touched the metal, something clicked in my brain. Like a door opening. Images flooded my mind—flashes of cities melting, people levitating into beams of light, time collapsing into itself. A countdown started behind my eyes.\n\n“Not ready,” the voice echoed again, fainter this time, as if buried behind glass.\n\nWhen I woke up again, the cube was gone. But something else stayed.\n\nNow I hear it every night—the hum. It’s louder now. Constant. There’s something beneath it, too. A whisper. Words I shouldn’t understand, but I do.\n\nThey’re coming back.\n\nNot just for me. For everyone.\n\nI think I was scanned. Tagged. Like some specimen in a petri dish. And that cube? It wasn’t a gift. It was a key.\n\nI’ve seen the sky crack twice more since then—quick slits, gone in seconds. Always followed by lights in the trees, animals acting strange, electronics dying for no reason. The last time, my reflection didn’t match me. Just for a second. But it smiled.\n\nI don’t sleep anymore. Not really. I see their shape in the fog, in my windows at night, hovering just behind the glass. Watching. Measuring.\n\nWaiting for the countdown to end.\n\nAnd it’s almost up.\n\nThey said I wasn’t ready.\n\nBut I think we all will be… soon.\n\nAnd we won’t have a choice.\n\nI’ll keep you updated….if I’m able.

Head-on collision. Drunk driver. Declared dead at the scene.\n\nThat was back in 2020. Grieving him through the pandemic, completely isolated, was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. But I worked through it with my parents, with his mom. I’ve even started dating again.\n\nBut then the texts started.\n\nI got the first one while I was on a date at some overfancy Italian place. A text, from Drew’s number. It was blank. Like someone had just hit the space bar and hit “send.”\n\nI got the next one a few days later, in the evening, while I was curled up with a book. It just had a period. “.”\n\nAt first, I thought it was a prank, as cruel as that would be. Or maybe it was well-intentioned, by an older person or someone on the spectrum. Maybe they thought the texts would make me happy. I asked around, but no one knew. I thought about going to the police—but there was nothing threatening in them. Just strings of weird punctuation.\n\n*Maybe it’s a glitch,* I thought. Maybe the system had reactivated his number by accident and was sending bits of code to me.\n\nBut the texts seemed to have a pattern. They were often sent when I was on a date, or getting ready for one. It seemed *just* enough to be more than coincidental. I tried telling myself I was being paranoid, that it was all just chance.\n\nAs the anniversary of his death approached, though, the texts increased in frequency. They went from one or two a week to one a day. “…” “.,.” “,,:” “,…….”. Just nonsensical punctuation, every time.\n\nI was starting to get desensitized to them. The first one had made me cry. Now, they just annoyed me.\n\nOn the anniversary of Drew’s death, though, the texts increased tenfold.\n\nI got five of them before noon.\n\nOver fifteen in the afternoon. And as the time of his death approached—9:11 PM—they came in faster and faster.\n\n*This is way more than coincidence.*\n\n*Someone is fucking with me.*\n\nI went to the police. They said they’d be able to trace where the texts were coming from, but they’d need some time to get in touch with the cell company. *“Probably just a scammer,”* the officer had said, even though I told him everything. *“There are tons of scams now, with how bad the economy is...”*\n\n*“But they’re not trying to get anything out of me,”* I’d told them. *“And they’re texting me way more today than any other day. On the day my husband died.”*\n\n*“I’m sorry for your loss,”* the officer had said, in a detached tone. *“We’ll get in touch with you when we know more. Okay?”*\n\nSo what else could I do?\n\nI went back home to start the tradition I did every year. At 7 o’clock I put on his favorite movie, *Stranger Than Fiction,* and opened a bottle of wine. I patted the seat next to me, as if gesturing an invisible him to sit down.\n\nI liked to talk to him. Pretend he was actually sitting there with me.\n\n“Maggie Gyllenhaal is so cute,” I told the empty spot. “I’d totally date her if I wasn’t married to you. And if, you know, she wasn’t a movie star.”\n\n“Will Ferrell is *so* young in this. He looks like a *baby.”*\n\n“Haha, he’s so awkward. She totally hates him.”\n\nMy phone pinged.\n\n**“…;**”\n\nI frowned at it.\n\nI decided to call the police station again. They told me they didn’t have any news.\n\nI looked at the empty spot.\n\n“I miss you,” I said, sucking in a deep breath. “I miss you so much.”\n\nI looked at the phone, waiting for it to ping. A small part of me wishing it would, like he’d heard me.\n\n*What if the texts really are Drew?*\n\n*Somehow?*\n\nI thought of that Twilight Zone episode. Where the old woman keeps getting phone calls, and then they find a downed telephone pole, the wires dangling over her husband’s grave. Was this sort of the 2000s equivalent of that? Had some spooky ghost EMF jammed the wireless cell communications?\n\nBut the phone didn’t ping. Of course it didn’t. This wasn’t his ghost trying to contact me. This was someone *fucking* with me, someone playing a sick game.\n\nThe only answer I’d get was from the police.\n\nI got up and refilled my wine glass. But my hands were shaking as I poured. As I tried to set it back on the counter, I dropped it—\n\n*Crash.*\n\nThe glass bottle shattered into a thousand jagged pieces. Merlot wine like blood pooled on the floor. *“Fuck,”* I whispered. Fighting tears, I got a garbage bag and bent down to pick up the pieces—\n\n*“Ow!”*\n\nThe piece I’d picked up had sliced right into my thumb. Never clean shattered glass while you’re tipsy and crying, I guess. Cursing, I stood up and ran my thumb under the faucet, staining the water red—\n\n*Ping.*\n\nI glanced over at my phone, sitting on the couch armrest.\n\nI turned off the faucet.\n\nMade my way over to it.\n\nMy heart plummeted as I saw the text.\n\n**“: )”**\n\nNot a blank text.\n\nNot a string of nonsense.\n\nA fucking *smiley face.*\n\nAfter I’d just cut myself.\n\nAnd not any smiley face. A colon, then a space, then a parenthesis—*exactly* how Drew made his smiley faces. He never wanted autocorrect or Gchat or whatever program to turn it into an emoji or actual smiley face.\n\n*Someone is watching me.*\n\n*And they really,* really *want to fuck with me.*\n\nI ran over to the kitchen window, tiptoeing around the glass. I pulled the curtains shut over the sink. Then I ran around the house, checking every lock.\n\nI called the police. “I think they’re watching me,” I whispered.\n\n“What?”\n\n“They sent me a smiley face. *Right after* I cut myself.”\n\n“Okay… that’s probably just a coincidence—”\n\n“They’ve never sent a smiley face before! Or *anything* other than nonsense!”\n\n“Okay, calm down. You know what? I’m going to get in touch with the cell company right away. I’ll call you back in about… twenty minutes. Okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nI glanced at the clock.\n\n8:59 PM.\n\n12 minutes before Drew died.\n\nI walked back to the couch, blood blooming on the paper towel wrapped around my finger. The phone was going off like crazy now. *Ping.* **“…….”** *Ping.* **“..:;..:::”** *Ping.*\n\n“Shut up,” I hissed.\n\nI looked at the empty spot.\n\nThe paused frame of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Will Ferrell looking at each other.\n\n*Ping. Ping. Ping.*\n\n*“SHUT UP!”*\n\n9:07 PM.\n\n*Ping ping ping ping—*\n\nI picked it up—\n\nOne word was mixed in with the nonsense.\n\n**…..:::;;;…**\n\n**RUN**\n\n**;;;,,,,,,,**\n\n**……::::…..**\n\n**RUN**\n\n**:::::::**\n\n**….**\n\n**RUN**\n\n**…::::;;;;;---**\n\n*Pingpingpingping—*\n\nThe barrage of texts was cut off by my ringtone.\n\nThe police station. Finally. “Hello?” I asked, my voice wavering.\n\n*“Get out of the house.”*\n\nHis voice was low, coming through the speaker.\n\n*“The texts are coming from inside your house.”*\n\nAll the blood drained out of my face. I leapt up and scrambled towards the front door—\n\nHands pulled me back roughly from behind. I fell flat on my face. Pain shot up my back. I looked up, blinking… and found myself looking up at Drew’s mother.\n\n*“Whore,”* she snarled, spit spraying on my face. Her foot collided with my side as she kicked me. “You think you can just pretend like he didn’t exist, don’t you? As soon as he’s dead, you just go off and start dating again.”\n\n“It’s… been… five… years,” I gasped.\n\n“You never really loved him, did you?!” she shrieked.\n\nI tried to scramble up. She kicked me again. I coughed blood onto the carpet. “Stop,” I whimpered.\n\n“You’re nothing but a—”\n\nThe door slammed open.\n\nA police officer was standing in the doorway.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe police had enough evidence to arrest Drew’s mother. She’d been watching me, stalking me, sending the nonsensical texts to scare me. Security camera footage from various restaurants and establishments even showed she followed me to several different dates. She didn’t even have to break into the house—Drew had given her a spare key, when he was alive.\n\nShe’d had Drew’s old number reactivated, and was sending me texts all the while, hoping I’d be spooked and stop dating. Stop moving forward. Stay with her in her cocoon of grief.\n\nShe didn’t see all the nights I’d cried myself to sleep after those dates. Wishing it was *him* next to me, knowing no one else would ever measure up.\n\nOne thing, however, remains unexplained.\n\nThe police, when they confiscated her phone, said she only ever sent symbols and smiley faces.\n\nShe never sent the word “RUN.”\n\nSometimes I wonder if those texts were from Drew.\n\nWatching over me, making sure I made it out alive."},"50":{"title":"I'm An Evil Doll But I'm Not The Problem: Part 25","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kf47p4\/im_an_evil_doll_but_im_not_the_problem_part_25\/","flair":"Series","author":"HughEhhoule","selftext":"If you’re wondering, what the hell?\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/ccXnnm0vpI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s blood on my hands, both literally and metaphorically. The crowd around me is stunned, but shock can only go so far. \r\n\r\nI know it’s coming, I don’t know exactly what it’s going to be, but this is a group of strong folks. They won’t take my antics lying down.\r\n\r\nIt’s Milton, unable to watch me mutilate his friend, he levels a skull crushing kick my way. Sprinting from the crowd. \r\n\r\nThrough blurred vision and encroaching dark spots I still see it coming a mile off. My misfiring brain tries in vain to think of an option that doesn’t throw another wrench into it’s gears, but there isn’t one. \r\n\r\nI try to tell myself it’s actually stopping bloodshed. By doing something brutal enough, the crowd will submit. I won’t have to watch Demi start tearing folks apart. \r\n\r\nIs that the truth though?

Sounds a lot like Satan talking through my neighbor’s dog, or needing to impress Jody Foster, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nBut none of that really matters in the moment. As the kick closes in, it’s a matter of life and death. \r\n\r\nThe jagged end of my walking stick buries itself in a place that should have everyone with a Johnson crossing their legs right now. My brain feels hot, tears start to fall as Milton hits the ground. Child-like pained screams eating at the fabric of my sanity like starved moth larva. \r\n\r\nI can’t cry, so I laugh, it’s a tortured sound. As I get to my feet, I retch but disguise it as a creepy lurch. \r\n\r\nThe survivalist type takes a step, I wind my leg back like a soccer player. Ready to drive the walking stick further into the wounded man. \r\n\r\nI can’t take this, the tension, the violence. I want so badly to cry. \r\n\r\nBut I can’t.\r\n\r\n“Milt there has about a 75% chance of survival if one of you know some basic first aid. Won’t be any little Miltons, but whatever, the world has enough jocks, am I right?” I say. I struggle to keep my voice even, I sound like an evil Emo Phillips, “ Anyone fucks around though, I’ll kick that straight into his brain.”\r\n\r\nI’m bastardizing everything I know, everything I stand for. From clown college to fighting the good fight. \r\n\r\nThe worst part is, it’s working. I’m controlling this crowd, I’m in their heads. Demi watching, enraptured. \r\n\r\n“Now that the cat’s out of the bag all of you need to understand something. \r\n\r\nThis little dance, I’m just doing it for fun. Every so often, it’s great to really get your hands in the soil, so to speak. \r\n\r\nI have abilities that’d have you making graven idols if I showed them to you. Next person that wants to test me, it won’t be skewered balls or a missing eye. I’ll fuse the group of you together, rearrange the pieces, and let you wander this place till someone puts you out of your misery.” My inflection is all wrong, but I only see a few people not buying it. \r\n\r\n“Meat!” I scream to Demi, “You grab Kyle. I’m going to take a bit of a DBAA tax.”\r\n\r\nMy voice is harsh and vile, I’m hitting my stride. I lean into Demi’s lie, and he gladly obliges, looking fearful at me as he starts to bind our target. \r\n\r\nThe crowd parts as I walk to the survivalist. \r\n\r\n“Food, weapons, and ammo.” I say.\r\n\r\nThe man takes off his jacket, and duffel. Then proceeds  to pull all manner of equipment and supplies from his pockets, adding it to the pile. \r\n\r\nI can’t let him give everything up. They’re going to be taking care of two wounded. I’m supposed to seem like a monster, not be one. \r\n\r\n“Are you trying to insult me?” I say, cocking my head and fixing the man with a glare, “I want some souvenirs, I’m not looking for your charity.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment I feel good about myself. It doesn’t last as he removes a pistol, hunting knife and a handful of protein bars. \r\n\r\nSomething about the look he gives me, tells me the man doesn’t quite believe my explanation.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave, I stop by the scrawny addict. \r\n\r\n“How much fun you have left in the bag?” I say, looking to the man protectively clutching his treasure. \r\n\r\nHe pulls out three more bottles of liquor offering them to me. Clearly more than could fit in the small bag.  \r\n\r\n“As much as I need.” He says defensively. \r\n\r\nWe make an Irish exit before fear turns to rage. The empty feeling backpack slung across my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You need to trust someone, kid.” Eli says. \r\n\r\nMy mentor, and one of my only friends. He’s a short old man, in his mid 80’s and tougher than a two dollar steak. \r\n\r\n“I know, but there aren’t many good options. Everyone here is so, strange. Morality is all, fucking, grey.”\r\n\r\n“That’s rich, coming from you.” Eli says, shaking his head. \r\n\r\n“That’s the problem. Here, I’ve got nothing. I need someone to tell me when I’m going off the rails. But in this place, there are no rails.” I reply. \r\n\r\n“Michael?” Demi says. \r\n\r\nI’m startled, I shake my head, and sure enough, Eli, is no where to be seen. \r\n\r\n“Just thinking, sorry.” I lie. \r\n\r\nI forgot how insidious hallucinations can be. How much they can camouflage themselves in a place like this. \r\n\r\n “Your mind can’t handle his domain.” Kyle chides from behind us. \r\n\r\nDemi holds a long impromptu rope tied around the man’s neck. \r\n\r\n“Listen here you docked-tail of a person. \r\n\r\nYou’re alive right now because I want to get the information you have without taking you apart doing it. \r\n\r\nBecause, yes, this place is a whole lot of no-good for me. \r\n\r\nKeep being obnoxious though, it’d be a lot quicker to just start taking pieces from you.” I reply half-heartedly. \r\n\r\n“You can trust me Michael.” Demi says a few minutes later. \r\n\r\n“Was I talking out loud?” I ask, embarrassed. \r\n\r\n“Mumbling, but keen ears and all.” Demi replies. \r\n\r\n“Back home my whole thing was going after guys like you. \r\n\r\nLife being what it is, I got dragged in a totally different direction, but the fact remains.\r\n\r\nYou’ve been in my head, you know this.” I say. \r\n\r\n“I can’t go through your mind like a book Michael. If I could, I’d have likely found a suitable lie long ago. \r\n\r\nBut as things stand now, maybe the truth would work a bit better?” Demi asks. \r\n\r\n“We’ve got time.” I say non-committedly. \r\n\r\nDemi opens his hand, a small hourglass appears in his palm. The top has sand as black as pitch, and is about 10 percent of the way full. In the bottom is pristine white sand. \r\n\r\nAs I watch it for a moment, I notice the sand isn’t moving. \r\n\r\n“I thought you said you didn’t have your magic here?” I say, annoyed. \r\n\r\n“This is something that I had made a part of me. Through great effort and pain, it’s as much my essence as my memories. \r\n\r\nYou’ve seen the imbued trash used by Leo and his ilk. You’ve encountered objects of power, but there is more. \r\n\r\nThings so connected to the force of the world they simply are. They cannot be destroyed, they cannot be changed, and they were created by something that sits above all else. \r\n\r\nNo one knows what happens when you pass beyond the void, true death is just as much of a mystery to me as you. \r\n\r\nThis object, does one thing. It quantifies your actions. Good and evil. It weighs them against each other.” Demi explains. \r\n\r\n“And?” I prod. \r\n\r\n“Knowing something is out there keeping track, well, you could say it made me paranoid. \r\n\r\nMy willingness to help isn’t out of some sense of altruism. Far from it. My goal is simple. \r\n\r\nI want to get out of this Karmic debt I’ve built up. After that, I’ll figure out a way to balance what I like to do with my fear of what is after.” Demi replies. \r\n\r\nIs it a lie, is it the truth? I don’t know. But I think that’s less important than what I do understand about what Demi said. \r\n\r\nIt’s an admission. Whatever gift wrapping he decided to put over the idea, at it’s core, I believe he believes that hourglass signals his fate. \r\n\r\nI don’t reply. Not directly at least, but Demi picks up on my lack of vitriol as we walk. \r\n\r\n\r\n“That one.” Demi says, pointing to a patch of wide leaved, multi colored flora. \r\n\r\nI may not necessarily trust Demi, but I trust his opinion on what we’re planning on doing next. \r\n\r\nWe walk Kyle to the edge of the plant life. Demi and I sit, I take out a couple of protein bars, and bottles of water, offering one of each to Kyle. \r\n\r\nHe sits, I can see the nervousness in his body language. In the way his eyes are darting around. \r\n\r\nDemi lets go of the leash. Far from relaxing our captive, it makes him sweat. \r\n\r\n“Eat, we’ve been walking for almost a day.” I say in a friendly tone. \r\n\r\nKyle looks suspicious. I pull a couple of 40’s of beer from the junkie’s backpack. \r\n\r\n“You smoke?” I ask, pulling a pack from the endless bag. \r\n\r\n“Not anymore.” Kyle replies. \r\n\r\n“I’m sure you won’t mind if I do.” I say, lighting a cigarette from a book of matches tucked inside the pack.\r\n\r\nI smoke, and eat, fighting off the temptation to drink the beer in front of me. \r\n\r\n“You want to make a deal.” Kyle asserts, eventually. \r\n\r\nDemi laughs. \r\n\r\n“What would you offer, if I was asking for a deal?” I say.\r\n\r\n“Your lives. I will make sure He knows you atoned for your mistakes.” Kyle replies, his tone confident. \r\n\r\nI cup my hands around my mouth, screaming at the ground, “ Hey dickhead, I’m right here and as of now, we have no idea how to stop you. \r\n\r\nOrder’s up, pickled clown with a side of English-style serial killer.”\r\n\r\nSeconds of silence. \r\n\r\n“Doesn’t seem ‘He’ is listening.” Demi states, mockingly. \r\n\r\n“If I were to take a guess, your conversations are of a more one-sided variety. \r\n\r\nSo here’s the situation. Not only do I not want to torture you, I don’t think it’s going to be that effective. Am I right?” I question. \r\n\r\nKyle grins, fresh wounds cracking and oozing blood, “Nothing you could do would sway me from my calling.”.\r\n\r\n“Damn, thought so.” I say facetiously, “Don’t worry though I’ve been thinking of a solution to that. \r\n\r\nDemi, what’s fear?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a human reaction to the unknown.” Demi says without missing a beat. \r\n\r\n“A lot of people confuse fear with horror. Horror is what happens when you see something bad in front of you and you want to get away from it. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling you don’t get effected too much by horror. You didn’t blink back there when I was popping both types of balls in the human body. \r\n\r\nMakes sense, you have to know, sooner or later Big Daddy Sand is going to be snacking on you. \r\n\r\nThe plant life next to us is just full critters. No idea what they are, or what they can do, but Demi says they’re not friendly.” I threaten. \r\n\r\nI see the wheels turning in Kyle’s brain.   \r\n\r\n“I’d walk into oblivion for He.” Is the brainwashed athlete’s reply. \r\n\r\n“I’m sure you would, you’re big, you’re fast, you probably think you’d have a chance in there. \r\n\r\nThat’s hope. And it’s a powerful drug, Kyle. Gives a whole lot of Dutch courage. \r\n\r\nCall me Narcan.” I spit. \r\n\r\nYou pick up a lot of party tricks trying to find your niche in clowning. Never know what might impress the right crowd. \r\n\r\nWhich is my roundabout way of saying there are 3 options for breaking a beer bottle over someone’s head. \r\n\r\nThe first, and safest is to bring a candy glass bottle. \r\n\r\nThe second requires a lot of practice, is likely to cause some minor cuts, and should only be done on yourself. Really, it should never be done because it’s stupid, but we’re comparing it to…\r\n\r\nThe third, which is simply smashing one over someone’s head and letting nature take it’s course. \r\n\r\n Seeing as I haven’t seen any candy glass, option one is off the table. I give myself a dose of option two, and leave option three for Kyle. \r\n\r\nHe screams, more from shock than pain as he tries to scramble away. I have a beer-soaked hand wrapped around his throat as I pin him to the ground. \r\n\r\nAlready I can hear wildlife within moving to the edges of the island of plant life. \r\n\r\n“You’re not going in alone. \r\n\r\nI’m coming in with you. You might be able to outsmart or outrun whatever’s in there, but all I’ve got to do is slow you down just enough so they catch up.” I rant. \r\n\r\n“You’d be killed alongside me.” Kyle says smugly. \r\n\r\n“And? I’ve got us beer battered and smelling like some rare steaks. I’d have thought me making death a group project would have been obvious.” is my reply. \r\n\r\nKyle stays silent, calling my bluff. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for him, I’m not bluffing. \r\n\r\nMy head begins to pound, whispers at the edge of my hearing. I have to get my shit together. \r\n\r\nI snap back to reality, screaming. I shake my head, grabbing Kyle by the wrist. \r\n\r\nHe’s bigger, he’s stronger, but he’s shocked, and scared. \r\n\r\nAlmost as much as I am. \r\n\r\nNone of the storm in my brain is helping. There is no dulling of the horror, no enjoying the bloodshed. Every noise, every sight gains an aura of death and evil beyond what it should. \r\n\r\n“If I don’t come back, just remember, Demi, you’re a murderous piece of shit, regardless of what god’s wristwatch says.” I say, dragging Kyle into the foliage. \r\n\r\nDecay, mold, and salt. The forest shimmers with unnatural colors in the sudden darkness. \r\n\r\n“Shit’s getting spooky now, isn’t it?” I whisper venomously. \r\n\r\nKyle tries to get out of my grip. He freezes as he feels the barrel of my newly acquired pistol against his thigh. \r\n\r\n“Whatever is coming for us, I can guarantee you won’t want to face it with a missing kneecap.” I whisper, looking around the alien landscape. \r\n\r\n“Hello?” a voice, deep within the forest says. Something about it is, off, almost robotic. \r\n\r\n“Hello?”, another deeper voice. \r\n\r\n“Help!”, we hear from a different direction, small and childlike. \r\n\r\nMy heart pounds hard enough to make me nauseous. Fear induced sweat pours from me. \r\n\r\nI’m betting my life on this guy cracking under the pressure. On the resolve of a zealot. But if Demi is right, my life won’t mean a damn thing if I can’t save my friends. \r\n\r\nMy eyes adjust and I can see the macabre scene. Horror never meant to be witnessed by the eyes of man. \r\n\r\nIn fungal growths bodies are fused with the thick, green trunked plants. Patches of skin and muscle removed, at first I think they’re nothing more than corpses. But as I watch in horror, I see twitches, shallow, pained breaths. \r\n\r\nWhile most of the wounds seem random, each has had their neck flensed open. Veins intact, vocal chords exposed. \r\n\r\nIt doesn’t take me long to see the cause of this unfortunate fate. But my strained mind can’t really comprehend it. \r\n\r\nIf I were to try and describe every deranged detail of these things, we’d be here all night. And even then, I’d never do them justice. \r\n\r\nThe entities are segmented but asymmetrical, slowly moving plated creatures somewhere on the Venn diagram of tortoise and insect. \r\n\r\nOne crawls up a body, spindly, curved legs moving just as quickly vertically as horizontally. \r\n\r\nA purple and yellow colored chitin plate falls backward, revealing a featureless black orb, with a thin, pointed proboscis. Hair-fine strands snake from beneath the armor plates and begin to prod at the poor soul’s vocal cords. \r\n\r\nWith a wet, cracking noise the creature jams it’s proboscis into it’s victim’s lung. \r\n\r\n“Hello?” The half-corpse says. \r\n\r\nA migraine almost literally from hell starts to take root. My eyes throb, I lose focus. \r\n\r\nFor a second I see them, every life I’ve I’ve taken, or ruined. Eyes burning with hatred, they scream questions I can never answer. \r\n\r\nI bite the inside of my cheek hard enough I feel a dull crunch. Blood fills my mouth, pain brings me back to reality. \r\n\r\nI spit the mouthful of blood in the direction of what I’ve dubbed ‘Bagpipers’, and whistle a sharp, shrill tone. \r\n\r\n“Orders up boys, come and fucking get it!” I scream. \r\n\r\nA half dozen of the hundred pound creatures begin to scuttle their way toward us. The leaves above us begin to shift and rattle. \r\n\r\nThe pathetic but resolute look on Kyles face hits me. The invasive thought of how he’s just some putz roped into shit well beyond him starts to nag at my conscience. \r\n\r\nSomething hits my shoulder, I look down to see a tiny version of the bagpiper, one of the young, I’m guessing. \r\n\r\nThe noise in the leaves. \r\n\r\nI watch as it extends those tiny fibers, almost whip-like. A quarter sized piece of cloth, skin and flesh disappears. The pain hits a full second afterward, as awful as it is, I play it up further. I scream like I’ve been castrated. \r\n\r\nBut I notice something odd, the thumb sized creature recoils, dropping it’s gram of flesh. I can’t describe it’s reaction better than saying it was like a cat eating a lemon. \r\n\r\nMore begin to fall, Kyle is struggling to avoid the lethal rain. \r\n\r\nI let go of his wrist, grabbing the young Bagpiper, and throwing it at the man. \r\n\r\nAs it hits him, blood spurts, the greedy, evil little thing begins burrowing just under his skin. \r\n\r\n“Interesting.” I say, wondering why they don’t seem to have a taste for clown. \r\n\r\nKyle falls, the creature has crawled three long inches under his skin. I see the fight drain out of his eyes. \r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you anything, He will forgive me. Just let me get out of here!” Kyle pleads. \r\n\r\nI drop to one knee crushing a Bagpiper. \r\n\r\n“No, no, no, no. \r\n\r\nI’m not getting out of here and having you stonewall me once your dick is out of the fire. \r\n\r\nGive me something I can use, then we can talk.” I draw the stolen knife as I talk, “Better hurry, sounds like mom and dad are coming to see what all the fuss is about.”\r\n\r\nKyle screams, then stammers, finally gritting his teeth and forcing out a sentence. \r\n\r\n“He seeks warmth. Everything he does is in search for it.” Kyle says, one incisor chipping. \r\n\r\nI skewer the Bagpiper under his leg, tearing it out the way it came. \r\n\r\n“Tick-tock Kyle, that was a good start, but I need more than that.” I whisper. \r\n\r\nI can’t tell If I’ve soaked through my clothes with sweat or pissed myself. Either way, I can nearly feel the reek coming off of me. \r\n\r\n“The lost, they placate him with crumbs. Cast offs from the wretched wanders. If you watch them you will find, He.” Kyle says, struggling to his feet. \r\n\r\nI keep the pistol leveled at him, making a show of weighing the value of his information. The massive bagpipers break through a bush, all around us the island of flora echoes with cries of “Hello?” and “Help!”.\r\n\r\nKyle tears another young bagpiper from his arm screaming with the effort. \r\n\r\n“Okay, you big baby, let’s go.” I say, trying to disguise my fear driven tremor as being eager to shoot. \r\n\r\nThe second his back is turned I’m running. Putting as much distance between me and the Bagpipers as possible. \r\n\r\n Demi looks both shocked and relieved as we scramble out of the treeline. The Bagpipers stop dead where the wet soil turns to gravel, the forest still ringing with the cries of their victims. \r\n\r\nI lose a few seconds of time, I’m sitting beside Demi, looking at Kyle from across a dimming fire. \r\n\r\n“We have to kill him. You know he’s just going to come after us if we don’t.” Demi says. \r\n\r\n“I did what you wanted!” Kyle retorts. \r\n\r\nEvery word is like an icepick in my head. \r\n\r\nI say nothing, getting up and grabbing my seltzer bottle. \r\n\r\nI give Demi a smirk before I turn to Kyle. \r\n\r\nGod I want a drink. As I try to walk calmly, to drive down the tremors and misfiring nerves, I imagine how good that first shot would feel going down. \r\n\r\n“We made a…” Kyle begins, I spray him in the face. \r\n\r\n“Do not open your eyes.” I say cryptically, hoping he takes the bait. \r\n\r\nHe doesn’t. \r\n\r\n“That’s the third smart thing I’ve seen you do. \r\n\r\nThat tingling, it’s because this is a bottle of Sodium Acrylate. Super glue, to dumb it down a few notches. \r\n\r\nMade to fix cuts in Vietnam, yadda, yadda, yadda. \r\n\r\nIf you stay here, wait till things get hot, let it dry, you’ll be able to peel it off. It’s going to take some skin, but you’re a tough guy, right?\r\n\r\nNow, if you’re stupid enough to open your eyes, well, then things get interesting. You’ll rip half of them out before you go into shock.” I lie. \r\n\r\nI’m not a religious guy, but I find myself praying to anything that feels like listening to make this guy believe me. If my brain was an engine, it’d be spewing black smoke by now. \r\n\r\nWhether divine intervention or self preservation, Kyle believes my horseshit. By the time he works up the balls to check his face, we’re long gone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So now all we have to do is try to find something cold in a desert.” Demi says as we follow a group of the lost. Their ramshackle vehicles moving at a turtle’s pace. \r\n\r\n“That’s the part I’m not worried about.” I say, reaching into the backpack and pulling out a bottle of computer duster. \r\n\r\nI turn it upside down, and a jet of freezing liquid dissipates against the hot gravel.  \r\n\r\n “You think it’ll be enough?” I ask, unsure. \r\n\r\n“It will, or it won’t. It’s what we have.\r\n\r\nOur goal is as much about the journey, the defiance, the battle of wills, as anything. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the will of whatever is below us, I can’t see it being a small thing.” Demi answers. \r\n\r\n“So what’s the plan?” I say, as the lost start to unload trunkfulls of junk into a massive pile. \r\n\r\n“One of us will need to go down there. As limber as you may be, the pit was dozens of feet, at least. So it will have to be me. \r\n\r\nI think I can manipulate that backpack enough to make a good show of things. It’s workings seem simple enough. \r\n\r\nYou, do what you do best. Distract the thing. Confuse it if you can.” Demi explains. \r\n\r\nI hate the perspective it gives me. I’m a throwaway piece in this game.\r\n\r\nWith their cargo unloaded the lost push their vehicles to the limit, getting as far away from what happens next as possible. \r\n\r\nIt’s a Grasping. Sets of long, clawed fingers work their way from the gravel. A widening pit appearing next to the pile of debris. \r\n\r\nTheir body language is greedy and perturbed, scraping the random objects into the widening maw.\r\n\r\n“Do keep up.” Demi says, sprinting toward the thing below the sand. \r\n\r\nI wish that was the zinger that started our plan working flawlessly, but it wasn’t. \r\n\r\n“The bag!” Demi yells twenty feet into our sprint to death. \r\n\r\nI grab the enchanted ( cursed?) thing, but as I wind back for the throw, something gives in my back. \r\n\r\nUnlike film, getting the shit kicked out of you while dehydrated and experiencing acute mental trauma doesn’t make you invincible. My body, much like my mind betrays me. \r\n\r\nHe’s far ahead of me by the time he looks back. That moment of lost focus is all it took though. \r\n\r\nIt knows we’re here. \r\n\r\nDemi barely avoids a massive claw, more come his way, and he scrambles to avoid the impending doom. \r\n\r\nI see him, about to dive into the pit, then the unexpected happens. \r\n\r\nTons upon tons of flesh, junk and plant life vomits from the ground. It’s a singular, forming mass, like a building sized organ suddenly prolapsing. \r\n\r\nCrude, rough features begin to take shape, a child’s cutout of a face tops a necrotic amalgam of flesh and stolen possessions.\r\n\r\nThe clawed fingers ring the body by the dozen. Demi, shocked at the thing is dealt a glancing blow, it sends him skittering across the gravel like a toy. \r\n\r\nI can stand, I can move, but I’m sure as hell not doing anything quickly. \r\n\r\nI start to laugh, or maybe cry. At the moment I don’t really know the difference. I see the futility of everything in the behemoth in front of me. \r\n\r\n   But I keep putting one foot in front of the other, there’s no taking back the decisions I’ve made.\r\n\r\nThe creature is focussed on Demi, I get in range, and throw a can of duster toward the creature. A shot from the pistol bursts it against the thing’s misbegotten flesh. \r\n\r\nFor a second, I see a hole, but before I can even judge the size it’s filled in with more unholy mass. \r\n\r\nMight as well have spat on the thing. \r\n\r\nDespite his speed, despite his strength, Demi doesn’t have long. \r\n\r\nSo, this is where I die then. \r\n\r\nI chase a quarter bottle of vodka with a long haul from the computer duster. When you have 5 minutes to live, no sense in going for your one year chip. \r\n\r\nThe toxins dull my hearing, the booze makes things feel far away. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker. \r\n\r\nI stand in front of a flesh wall enforced with all manner of materials. I snap the tops off of two cans of duster, aiming the freezing jets ahead of me. \r\n\r\nIt cuts through the thing like boiling water through sugar, but the damage is superficial at best. \r\n\r\nI need to get deeper. \r\n\r\nI wade into the thing as Demi fights for his life. \r\n\r\nPressure, crushing, from all sides. Flesh and debris press in as fast as the CO2 can destroy it. I press forward, as much of the freezing liquid spraying on me as the flesh around me. \r\n\r\nThe cracks in my mind turn to fissures, every step forward a test of endurance and pain tolerance. \r\n\r\nIt’s a blur, I feel my hair torn from my skull, a finger breaks, my leg is twisted at an ungodly angle, but I keep moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe flesh around me begins to change from a sickening yellow to a deep crimson. \r\n\r\nI feel it, more than hear it. \r\n\r\nHe, screams. \r\n\r\nI grip the backpack with bloody fingers, spraying CO2 like holy water through the thinning muscle of this abomination. \r\n\r\nI lose the tip of my nose and part of my chin to the freezing liquid, but eventually tear through to somewhere cavernous. \r\n\r\nAll around me twisted mixes of organs and machine pump and churn. It’s hot as hell. \r\n\r\nIn the centre of it all stands a figure, naked, sexless, but almost human. \r\n\r\nI lurch forward, one leg locked, prodding torn lips with a split tongue. \r\n\r\n“If you kill me, this place will become overran. I am it’s heart, I am the conundrum, the starving, the bloated. \r\n\r\nI am the only person that never was.\r\n\r\nThis place will become nothing more than an abattoir of souls.” It says. \r\n\r\nIt doesn’t walk, the fleshy ground below it simply glides it forward. \r\n\r\n“You’re not lying, are you?” I say as I stand face to face with the lithe thing. \r\n\r\n“Every accidental wanderer, every person destined to nothing more than a few hours of horror, they will die. From now until eternity.” He replies. \r\n\r\nThe smile I give it, puts a look of shock on it’s warped face. \r\n\r\n“Oh no, that’ll probably drive me moderately more, insane.” I taunt, “The thing is, no one else will ever know. I’ll take that secret to my fucking grave. Which I’ll probably be tucked into in about five minutes here.\r\n\r\nI get it now, that’s why I’m here.”\r\n\r\nLong, bone shafted, steel tipped barbs start to extend from the walls. \r\n\r\n“I can let you escape, your friend too.” He offers. \r\n\r\nMy answer is to reach into the bag. This time though, I turn it inside out. \r\n\r\nI feel like I’ve been hit by a train, in an instant the world around me is a hailstorm of cans. Sounds of rupture like ricochets start to chain together as the thousands upon thousands of cans collide. \r\n\r\nA scream that shakes my soul, pain, hot blood, searing cold. It’s a storm and an earthquake all at once. \r\n\r\nA sharp blow, the world goes black, this is the end. \r\n\r\n\r\n“Michael!” I hear, muffled. Arms like steel dragging me from rotting flesh and rusted steel. \r\n\r\nI see the alien sky above me, and through all the mental fog I find I’m happy to still be alive. \r\n\r\nExpect to hear from Punch next week, I don’t know how much sense I’m going to be making in the near future. \r\n\r\nThanks for listening. \r\n\r\nMike \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"},"51":{"title":"Don't Trust HR. My Performance Review Nearly Killed Me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kejx3u\/dont_trust_hr_my_performance_review_nearly_killed\/","flair":null,"author":"Accomplished_Low7889","selftext":"I had just opened my laptop when the HR email landed in my inbox: \n\n*\"Your Performance Review is scheduled to begin. Please present yourself to Office 3 tomorrow at 8:00 AM for the calibration procedure.\"* \n\nCalibration. The word buzzed with possibility.\n\nThis wasn't just any performance review; this was *the* review, the yearly one that would hopefully catapult me into a senior role. Operations, perhaps. \n\nThe word alone felt far more exciting than the financial spreadsheets and SQL queries I’d spent the last year working on. And my boss was from Operations, a realm of decisions and action I desperately wanted to join.\n\nJust as the clock ticked past five, he appeared at my cubicle, a wide grin splitting his face. He leaned against the fabric wall, his weight shifted slightly due to the pronounced limp in his gait – a souvenir, he'd once mentioned, from a hiking accident that had cost part of his leg.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, clapping me on the shoulder. \"Big day tomorrow, huh? Don't let me down.\" \n\nI gave him a half-smile, my gaze drawn to his company badge. An imposing black, so different from the sea of blue worn by us junior staff. I just wished I had one like that for myself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe big day came, and I arrived early at Office 3. \n\nIt was in a part of town I'd never been to, a somewhat isolated area near the port, with not much else around. \n\nIt struck me then, not for the first time, that despite the time at the job, I couldn't quite articulate what it was the company did. \n\nThe specifics of our products were shrouded in secrecy; all we knew were the government contracts and sensitive technology. Security, I was told. Maybe with a promotion, the fog would finally lift.\n\nStepping into the waiting room, marked by a large \"HR\" sign, I was met by a stern-faced secretary who simply gestured for me to sit. Three other employees were already present.\n\nOne was Emma, a sweet, young woman from IT. We'd exchanged polite nods in the hallways before. She offered me a bright smile, the first to break the tension in the room. \n\nAn older man, probably in his late fifties with graying hair, sat silently nearby; I knew him from the accounting department. There was also a third person, someone I'd seen around the office but didn't know – an engineer, I believe. He kept to himself, looking around with a similar air of unease.\n\nA knot tightened in my stomach. Were we all competing for the same promotion? The email had been vague about the process. The secretary finally rose and motioned for us to follow. \n\nWe navigated a series of dim corridors until we reached a wooden door. She opened it just enough for us to pass through and tersely instructed us to \"step in.\"\n\nA shared, confused glance passed between the four of us before we complied. The door shut behind with a thud.\n\nThe room we entered was vast, the size of a tennis court. A metal framework dominated the space, and above us, harsh lights and a half-dozen cameras were fixed. Along the side, a panel of glass stood out.\n\nMy eyes focused on the glass, and I noticed something strange. On the other side I could see my boss and other department managers I recognized. They sat in comfortable chairs, watching us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd my boss was the first to get up to approach a computer located near the glass. \n\nHe took his black badge, swiped it somewhere and picked up a microphone attached to the console.\n\n\"This is a performance review and the calibration process for promotion to Operations Manager of the second region – my position,\" he began, his voice amplified through the sound system. \"Please proceed to one of the panels. The streaming starts now.\"\n\nA red light illuminated on the cameras. They were recording us.\n\nIn the center of the room, four panels were arranged in a tight circle, each screen facing inward like part of a bizarre game show. A small hole was visible in each panel, and a white circle on the floor indicated where I assumed we should stand.\n\nWe approached, a wave of nervousness washing over us. No one seemed to have any idea what was going on.\n\n\"Please position yourselves at the white circle,\" my boss instructed, and we obeyed.\n\nOnce the four of us were standing within the marked area, he continued. \"The process will be divided into three stages, and may be extended until we have a selected candidate. The first stage is called *Screening,* and it’s just a form requesting your information and resume details. Please fill it out accurately and, no matter what, don't lie.\"\n\nOn my panel, a form appeared, filled with a variety of professional and even personal questions.\n\n\"Are you married?\" \"What other languages do you know?\" \"What's your level in dealing with complex data?\"\n\nAbout twenty compressed questions appeared on the touchscreen, which we answered in silence. I filled it all out and tapped \"Done.\" The rest of the candidates soon finished.\n\n\"Very good,\" my boss said through the microphone. \"Now the data will be analyzed before the next phase.\"\n\nWe waited for about ten anxious minutes, watching my boss check some stuff on the computer, analyzing it and occasionally discussing something with the other department heads.\n\nThen he finally returned to the microphone. \"Candidate William, you are eliminated from the process for lying.\"\n\nWe heard a thud from the side of the engineer, the one I didn't know well. He collapsed, smoke rising from his forehead—like he’d been shot.\n\nEmma let out a sharp scream of shock. The older accounting man and I remained silent, our faces drained of color.\n\nWhen I snapped out of it and went to try and help the engineer, I heard my boss's voice cutting through.\n\n\"Stop right there,\" he commanded, and through the glass, I saw him looking directly at me. \"There's a gun above your panel that's aimed directly at your head. If any of you step out of the white circle, you are terminated. Candidate William lied in his form and paid the price. It's a 100% confirmed lie, based on our analysis. No cheating will be allowed in this process.\"\n\nMy body stiffened. I stared at the hole in the terminal—there was definitely a barrel in it, pointed straight at me.\n\n\"Now,\" my boss continued. \"Let's move on to phase 2.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEmma was sobbing uncontrollably, her whole body trembling with fear as my boss recited the rules for the next stage.\n\n\"We’ll proceed to *Company Knowledge.* It’s a quiz to determine who truly understands the company's core principles and key results,\" he stated flatly, as if reading from a script. \"I will make ten statements. You will have five seconds to answer true or false on your terminal. The one with the most incorrect answers at the end will be terminated.\"\n\nBefore we could even process the information, he delivered the first statement.\n\n*\"Integrity is one of our five principles.\"*\n\nTrue or false appeared on my screen. We three exchanged panicked glances for a split second. Luckily, I knew this one. \"True!\" I blurted out.\n\nWe all tapped our screens, and a moment later, a green confirmation flashed on mine.\n\nThe next few statements came in rapid succession. \"*Our primary client is the Department of Defense*\" (True, I remembered seeing that in some document). \"*Our CEO has been with the company for over twenty years*\" (False, Emma got that one). \"*Sustainability is a major focus in our operational guidelines*\" (False, the older man confirmed).\n\nEach time, one of us had the right answer or an educated guess to share out loud with the rest. A fragile sense of camaraderie formed amidst the fear of what would happen to the loser.\n\nEmma, though clearly terrified, tried her best to keep up, her brow furrowed in concentration. The older man remained largely quiet, his answers appearing on his screen just a fraction of a second after ours.\n\nWe managed to get through nine sentences this way, leading to nine correct answers for the three of us.\n\nFinally came the tenth: \"*Our year-over-year revenue growth was 14% last year*\" \n\nA wave of uncertainty hit. I didn’t recall seeing that specific figure anywhere. Emma looked lost, and the older man's face remained impassive.\n\nThen, the man suddenly declared, \"True.\"\n\nEmma, trusting his apparent certainty, quickly tapped \"True\" on her screen. \n\nMy finger hovered over the options. \"True\" felt plausible, but something nagged at the back of my mind – a half-forgotten chart in a financial report. At the very last second, I realized it couldn’t be 14%. It was closer to 9%.\n\nI slammed my finger down on \"False.\"\n\nI glanced at the older man. There was a flicker in his eyes, a brief, almost imperceptible glint of something that looked like… satisfaction? He had known. He had deliberately given the wrong answer.\n\nThe boss's voice echoed through the room. \"Two candidates answered all questions correctly. Candidate Emma, with nine correct answers, is eliminated from the process.\"\n\nA heavy silence descended. Emma gasped, her eyes met mine for a fleeting second, and then I heard it again. The thud.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs her body fell heavily to the floor, a surge of rage filled my chest.\n\n\"You can’t do this!\" I shouted, confronting my boss in a fit of fury. He ignored my outburst and indicated that the next stage was about to begin.\n\nFor a moment, I considered running to the door as fast as I could. But then I glanced back at the hole in the terminal, the reminder of how quickly the others had been killed.\n\nI turned to the older man, anger lacing my voice. \"Why did you give her the wrong answer?\" He also offered no reply, only a cold, unwavering stare.\n\n“The next phase will now begin,” the sound echoed. “It is called *'Sheer Will*,' and it will test each participant's true desire for the promotion.\"\n\nThe other managers rose from their comfortable chairs and approached the glass, their anticipation palpable, as if this were the highlight of the event.\n\nMy boss typed something into the computer and swiped his badge again. This time, the panel structure lid in front of us slid open, revealing an object.\n\nIt was a… baseball bat. Its end was studded with spikes and nails. A deadly weapon.\n\n\"The rules are simple,\" his voice echoed. \"The last one standing gets the job. You may begin.\"\n\nI stared at the object, frozen in disbelief. When I finally registered what was going on, the older man was already charging towards me, a mix of determination and desperation in his eyes, the spiked bat raised in hand.\n\nWhat followed happened so fast I can't explain it.\n\nI snatched up the bat just as he swung his own. I raised my hand to block the blow—instinctively. The nails tore through my skin, searing pain exploding as the bat got stuck in my palm, stopping a second hit.\n\nWith my other arm, gripping my own weapon, I retaliated with a single upward swing that pierced his jaw and neck.\n\nThirty seconds after my boss's announcement, the man laid on the floor with his neck open, gasping for air. I sank down beside him, in shock.\n\nThen I heard the clapping. \n\nThe other managers who had been watching were now cheering and applauding as if it were a sports show. The recording cameras had shifted to a lower angle, providing a gruesome close-up of me.\n\nMy boss had vanished from behind the glass but reappeared at the wooden door, limping towards me. I sat numbly on the floor, my shirt now stained with droplets of blood. As he got close, he helped me to my feet.\n\n\"Kid, you did much better than I did,\" he said, gesturing to his leg and glancing at my mangled hand. “I’m so proud of you.”\n\nMy gaze kept going back to Emma's lifeless body.\n\nThen he removed his badge, the black one I had always admired, and placed it around my neck. \n\n\"You'll be an incredible manager,\" he stated before turning and walking away.\n\n"},"52":{"title":"There’s a coven at our wellness retreat. The elder devoured my girlfriend, and I think I’m next.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1keyurm\/theres_a_coven_at_our_wellness_retreat_the_elder\/","flair":null,"author":"khalimaaahh","selftext":"# I’m leaving this as a warning. I urge you not to attend the Wellness Retreat in the Pacific Northwest. The cult, or coven… whatever they are, put us under some spell. Their elder spewed something black and nefarious into my girlfriend’s mouth. Things got much, much worse from there.\n\n\n\n••\n\n\n\nWe arrived for our first day at the Wellness Retreat on the Pacific Northwest coast. We’d been looking forward to decompressing from our busy, stressful lives in the city. My girlfriend, Aubrey, signed us up for the chanting ritual and forest bathing sessions, our favorite activities from the mindfulness and meditation package. \n\n\n\nOur first chanting session at the yurt in the woods was starting soon, so we slipped on our favorite athleisure outfits, tied our hair up, and headed out the door. \n\n\n\nWe reached the signpost near the trailhead and followed the winding path that cut through the cedar, pine, and maple trees. The forest felt ominous, almost threatening. The only sounds came from our feet stomping the fallen leaves beneath us. \n\n\n\nWe navigated further down the path, finally spotting the yurt in the distance. Its walls were held together by intertwining, twisted branches and packed earth. I could see the flickering of warm candlelight dancing across the walls inside the edifice. As we approached, luminaries lined the path into the gaping mouth of the structure—a calm, glowing welcome. The dome was coral blue, contrasting the forest's deep greens and browns. The exterior walls were decorated with paintings and symbols. \n\n\n\nWhen we stepped inside, the spiritual guide greeted us. Her piercing, stone grey eyes peered into mine. It felt like she could read my thoughts and gaze into my soul. She had long, frail hair that fell wildly down to her waist. Her face appeared sunken, almost sickly, and her harsh cheekbones were sharp.\n\n\n\nShe handed us each a cup of tea and requested we drink it before the chanting ceremony began. The contents were a dark, black liquid adorned with gnarled stems and roots. I leaned in to smell the brew and quickly regretted my decision. The stench was putrid, almost nauseating. \n\n\n\nAubrey gulped hers down first. I took a deep breath to work up the courage, and finally tipped back my cup. It tasted even worse than it smelled. The liquid flowed down my throat like razors, and my mouth felt like it was on fire.\n\n\n\n“Should we go in for seconds?” I snarkily remarked as I choked it down. Aubrey chuckled a bit out of sympathy; her face was grimacing and contorted from consuming the concoction as we moved further inside the room to join the other guests.\n\n\n\nThe old woman crept toward the center of the space. Aubrey and I maintained our focus on her as she began chanting in a raspy, monotone voice while she poured some of the rancid black liquid into her bowl.\n\n  \n\n\n*“Om namah Shivaya. Ra ma da sssaaaa!”* \n\n  \n\n\nThe elder paused for a moment, scanning the room. The air was heavy and suffocating, and her chant felt like a vacuum slurping up the oxygen in the chamber. She raised the ceremonial bowl, extending her arms to the dark sky above, and offered it to the large opening in the structure's ceiling.\n\n  \n\n\n“We invoke you, Mother! Cleanse our souls and consume our burdens!”\n\n  \n\n\nThe other guests began rehearsing lines. Their bodies swaying slightly to the cadence of the script, as if under a spell, crying out, “Oh Mother, we love you so!”\n\n  \n\n\nSuddenly, a swift breeze drove through the space, extinguishing the flickering candles. A wave of unease came over me. I started to feel nauseous, my vision blurred, and my ears began to ring slightly.\n\n  \n\n\nI looked over at Aubrey. She was shaking. Violently. \n\n  \n\n\nHer eyes had rolled back in her head, exposing only white. She began foaming at the mouth and convulsing as she crumpled toward the floor.\n\n\n\nThe elder woman leading the ceremony rushed over and crouched beside Aubrey. She leaned in, grabbing Aubrey’s face with her spindly fingers. The woman’s long, brittle hair created a canopy that engulfed them both.\n\n\n\nI watched in horror as the elder slowly opened her jaws, the skin beyond her lips tearing at the corners as her maw extended unnaturally wide. She extended her fingers. Her jagged, twisted nails reached into Aubrey’s mouth, forcing her jaw open, and began spewing a black secretion down her throat.\n\n\n\nI tried to scream. Tried to move. Tried crying out for help. *Nothing.*\n\n\n\nMy vision was getting blurrier, now a narrow, darkening tunnel. I tried reaching out to Aubrey again, grasping at the air, but the concoction had taken hold of me. I was sinking further and further from consciousness.\n\n\n\nThen everything went black.\n\n\n\n••\n\n\n\nI woke up in bed, my head pounding. The room swallowed all light and sound. I looked out the window, still dark. Glancing at the opposite side of the bed, I saw Aubrey asleep, her chest rising and falling. I took a deep sigh of relief. \n\n\n\nAubrey’s alive.\n\n\n\nFeeling dehydrated, I slipped out of bed and went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water. I made my way back to the bedroom, stepping gently not to wake Aubrey. As I entered the room, I felt the air had changed. \n\n\n\nAs I looked toward Aubrey, my glass came crashing to the floor, shattering into dozens of pieces. There in the dark, was my girlfriend sitting upright, stiff. Her arms dropped to her sides. Her eyes rolled back again, her pupils disappearing behind her skull. Her mouth gaped open as she stared forward into the darkness.\n\n\n\n“Aubrey*, wake up!*”\n\n\n\nI rushed to her side, my bare feet tearing on the shards of glass strewn across the floor. I grabbed Aubrey by the shoulders and shook her. Desperately pleading, tears streaming down my face.\n\n\n\n“Aubrey, *please, please* wake up!” No response. I ran to the kitchen to grab a wet towel, trying carefully to avoid the glass on the floor this time; maybe a cold, damp cloth would wake her.\n\n\n\nAs I returned, she had fallen back into bed fast asleep.\n\n\n\n••\n\n\n\nThe following morning, Aubrey looked strangely refreshed. There were no longer dark circles under her eyes, and her skin was radiant. She almost appeared… younger.\n\n\n\nLooking closer, I could see her eyes had somehow changed. Instead of rich brown, they were slate grey—the same shade of grey I saw in the old woman’s gaze at the chanting. A wave of distress washed over me as we made eye contact.\n\n\n\n“What happened last night? I remember drinking that awful tea, then everything just went dark.”\n\n\n\nI explained the horrors, everything I saw, the black fluid—all of it. Aubrey looked oddly dismissive, brushing off the nightmare I had just spent the last twenty minutes explaining to her.\n\n \n\n“There must have been something in the tea. We’re at a wellness retreat after all. I feel fine, rested even! Come on, let's get ready. Forest bathing starts in an hour.”\n\n\n\n••\n\n\n\nAgainst my better judgment and pleading, we arrived at a small clearing in the woods near the coast. Waves crashed against the cliffs, and a steady, cool breeze howled through the canopy above. The resinous scent of furs and pines filled the air. Even during the day, the forest was dark and damp here.\n\n\n\nTo our surprise, no one was around—not a single guest, not even the staff—just the howling of the wind and the waves threatening the cliffs in the distance.\n\n\n\n“Where the hell is everyone?” I questioned anxiously. My instinct was screaming to turn around, leave, and never look back. \n\n\n\n“Let’s just head back. Something feels… off.”\n\n\n\nAubrey wasn’t feeling the same sentiment. “I’m sure they’ll be here soon. We already came all this way, let’s just wait ten more minutes.”\n\n\n\nThis wasn’t like Aubrey. She was typically even more cautious and risk-averse than I was. I shrugged it off, hoping the ten minutes would pass so we could *finally* get the hell out of here.\n\n\n\nThe sun had started to fade, casting tall shadows across the floor of the opening in the woods from the towering trees surrounding it. Suddenly, I heard a disturbance resonating deep within the endless dark forest. \n\n\n\nI paused, tuning my ears to the thicket beyond. My heart started pounding.\n\n\n\nThe noises grew closer. Discarded leaves and broken branches crackled under heavy footsteps. I could also hear voices between the gusts of wind—a chorus coming from all directions—the sound of a dozen people chanting in unison.  \n\n\n*“Om namah Shivaya!”*  \n\n\n*No. No****.*** ***No.***\n\n\n\nA flood of overwhelming panic replaced my anxiety. The chanting grew louder. I couldn’t hear myself think; they were closing in, encircling us.\n\n\n\n*“Ra ma da sssaaaaa!”* \n\n\n\nI could see the group exiting the woods and entering the clearing. The elder appeared. She looked different, more deformed than before. Her arms and fingers were irregularly long, and her skin grey. Her presence immediately felt darker, more threatening. \n\n\n\nThe witch’s cold, grey eyes scanned the surroundings, sharp like daggers as she continued chanting and creeping directly toward us, picking up speed. \n\n\n\n“Aubrey, something is seriously wrong. We have to get the hell out of here*!*”\n\n\n\nBut it was too late. She was already in the elder’s grasp, under her spell. Motionless.\n\n\n\nMy heart was racing as a torrent of panic overcame me. My nerves hummed like lightning. I wanted to run to Aubrey. Tear her from the crone's grasp so we could escape. But I couldn’t move either, trapped in my frozen body.\n\n\n\nAll I could do was watch in horror as the elder extended her twisted, bony fingers to Aubrey’s face. With the tips of her long, jagged fingernails, she carved an incision from Aubrey’s chin to the side of her nose, up through her forehead, and toward the back of her skull. Blood trickling down Aubrey’s face. \n\n\n\nOnce satisfied, the witch began to slide her fingers under Aubrey’s flesh and began to peel back both sides, exposing her insides. Aubrey wasn’t screaming. She didn’t flinch as the old woman’s lower jaw unhinged, displaying rows of jagged, serrated teeth.\n\n\n\nThe witch lifted her head toward the midnight sky and let out an ear-piercing shriek, then sank her teeth into Aubrey’s insides. The air filled with the sound of bones cracking and crunching. Muscles, meat, and tendons shredding between her jagged teeth while I watched in horror as she consumed Aubrey—the smell of metal circulating in the air.\n\n\n\nShe unzipped the rest of Aubrey’s flesh using her serrated fingernails, tracing from the back of her head down to the bottom of her back. The witch reached deeper into the bag of flesh, thrashing and tearing out the remaining organic matter, chunks of meat, organs, and splintered bones, all discarded into a pile of slop beside her. \n\n\n\nThe clothes Aubrey had been wearing no longer clung to her body, fell to the ground, soaking into the pool of blood and guts on the floor as the elder pressed further into Aubrey.\n\n\n\nThe witch disrobed. Her blood-soaked grin widened as she began sliding Aubrey’s soft tissue over her own and wrapping Aubrey’s face around hers to a perfect fit. She let out a blood-curdling scream as the grotesque transformation was complete.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the chanting stopped. The forest fell silent. I could feel the spell the sorceress had cast on me breaking. My heart beat wildly, like a sledgehammer against my ribcage.\n\n\n\n*Thu—Thump*. *Thu—Thump*. *Thu—Thump*.\n\n\n\n***RUN.***\n\n\n\n••\n\n\n\nI woke up the following morning—at least I think it was morning. I can’t remember how I made it back to the casita. My head was pounding. I walked to the bathroom to wash my face and collect myself. \n\n\n\nMy heart dropped as I looked in the mirror. The hair on the back of my neck stood up straight like it was pumping electric current. In the reflection, I could see that my eyes were a piercing stone grey, and a cup of black tea was on the counter."},"53":{"title":"There's a man who stands on the abandoned roof across from my window every night watching the sky. No one else can see him, and I think I just made him notice me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1keq4im\/theres_a_man_who_stands_on_the_abandoned_roof\/","flair":null,"author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"I don’t really know  how to phrase it. This thing has been unsettling me, terrifying me, for a while now, and I can’t keep it bottled up anymore. I live alone in an apartment in, well… let’s just say an older part of town, a bit run-down maybe. I won't say exactly where because of the rules here, and frankly, because I'm already scared enough. My apartment is on the third floor. My balcony and my bedroom window look out over the street and directly at an old, abandoned house on the other side. It's been sealed up for years; nobody goes in, nobody comes out. The windows are broken, the main door is padlocked shut, and the whole place just radiates decay.\n\nThis whole thing started about… maybe three or four months ago. Like usual, I was staying up a bit late on the balcony, maybe having a smoke or a cup of tea before heading to bed. One night, I noticed a silhouette standing on the roof of that abandoned house. At first, I didn't process it, couldn't quite make it out. It was pretty dark, but the streetlights cast enough illumination over the area. I focused a little harder… No, that was definitely a person. A man, standing there.\n\nI was immediately confused. This house is locked up tight; no one ever goes near it. Who would be climbing onto its roof? And how? My first thought was maybe it was just some local kids messing around. But this man was standing perfectly still. Not moving at all. And stranger still… he was looking up. At the sky. His head was tilted back as if he were stargazing or… or I honestly don’t know what he was doing.\n\nI watched him for about five minutes. He didn't budge. Stood there like a statue, gazing upwards. He looked completely ordinary, by the way. Wearing normal clothes – pants and a shirt or t-shirt, hard to tell exactly from the distance and in the dim light. His build was average, not particularly large or thin. But what was strange and unsettling, apart from his presence there, was that I couldn't see his face at all. His head was tilted back at such an angle that no matter how I tried, I could only maybe make out his chin and the back of his hair.\n\nI felt a little uneasy, went inside, locked the balcony door, and went to sleep. The next day, I’d mostly forgotten about it. Until that night. Around the same time, I stepped out onto the balcony… and there he was. Standing in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose, looking up at the sky. This time, I felt a genuine sense of dread. Who was this? What was he doing every night on the roof of a locked, abandoned house? And why did he just keep staring at the sky like that?\n\nI didn’t sleep well that night. My mind kept racing. Maybe a burglar scouting the area? But there’s nothing to steal in that ruin. Maybe someone mentally unwell? Maybe someone… I didn’t know. The next morning, on my way to work, I made a point of looking closely at the abandoned house. No sign of anyone. The door was still padlocked; the windows were still broken. No indication that anyone had been coming or going.\n\nThis became a pattern. Every single night. The same man, the same spot on the roof, the same posture, looking up at the sky. He never missed a night. He became a part of my nightly routine, a deeply unsettling part. Sometimes I’d go out onto the balcony specifically to see if he was there. Other times, I’d avoid the balcony altogether, staying in my room, terrified to even glance out the window and find him standing there.\n\nI started to feel real anxiety. This wasn't normal. I began asking around the neighborhood, subtly. I went down to talk to Mr. Henderson, the superintendent of my building, an older guy who’s lived in the area forever.\n\n“Hey, Mr. Henderson, can I ask you something?”\n\n“Sure thing. What’s up?”\n\n“That abandoned house across the street… does anyone ever go up on its roof at night?”\n\nMr. Henderson looked at me like I had two heads. \n\n“The roof? What roof? That place is a wreck, son. Been boarded up for more than twenty years. Nobody can get up on that roof anyway. The inside staircase collapsed years ago.”\n\n“Are you sure, Mr. Henderson? Because I thought I…” \n\nI trailed off. What was I going to say? That I see a guy standing there looking at the sky every night? He’d think I was crazy.\n\n“Positive. I’ve been here long before you moved in. Nobody goes near that house.”\n\nI just said okay, thanked him, and went back upstairs feeling like something was seriously wrong. Either Mr. Henderson wasn't paying attention, or… or I was hallucinating.\n\nI went to the small convenience store down the block. Asked the guy behind the counter the same question, but indirectly.\n\n“What’s the story with that boarded-up house, anyway? Looks kind of creepy.”\n\n“Oh, that was old Mr. Abernathy’s place… died, him and his wife, in an accident years back. Kids sold it to someone who just let it sit, then they moved away. Place is probably haunted” \n\nhe said that last part with a little smirk.\n\n“Haunted? Haunted by what?”\n\n“Ghosts, spirits… you know, local talk. Point is, nobody goes near it after dark.”\n\n“Right… Have you ever seen anyone strange hanging around it? Maybe lurking nearby? Or… on the roof, maybe?”\n\nThe shopkeeper laughed. \n\n“The roof? Who’d be able to get up there? Nah, nobody goes near it. You seen something?”\n\nI felt like if I told him, he’d either laugh at me or get spooked. I just said,\n\n “No, no, just asking. It looks weird.”\n\n And I left.\n\nI sat with myself, thinking. Nobody sees him but me? How is that possible? Am I imagining it? But I see him so clearly every night. Standing right there. A physical presence. So why doesn’t anyone else see him? Does he only appear to me? Why?\n\nThese questions started eating away at me. I wasn't sleeping properly anymore. I was constantly anxious and tense. Every time evening approached, my heart would start beating faster. I’d approach the window hesitantly. Look out cautiously… and find him. Standing in his spot. Looking at the sky.\n\nI started observing him more intently. Trying to notice any detail. His clothes were almost always the same. His posture never changed. He never moved at all. Like a mannequin placed up there. Sometimes I’d stare at him for hours, waiting for any movement, any change. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But the feeling of anxiety and suspicion grew stronger inside me. There was something fundamentally wrong about this man, about his stance, and about the fact that nobody else seemed to see him.\n\nAnother month passed like this. I was nearing a nervous breakdown. I felt like I was officially losing my mind. I considered seeing a therapist. But I was scared. Scared they’d lock me up or put me on medication that would numb me. More importantly, I had this gut feeling that this was real. Not delusions. Something was happening, and I was the only one witnessing it.\n\nI started considering wild explanations. Was he a ghost? Some kind of spirit? But if so, why just stand there looking at the sky? The ghosts and spirits you hear about usually try to scare people, harm them, make noises. This figure was completely silent, seemingly peaceful. But his very existence had become terrifying to me. Terrifying because of the mystery surrounding him, and because of the feeling that I was the only person on Earth who could see him.\n\nThat sense of isolation was crushing. Like there was a secret between me and this entity, a secret nobody else in the world knew. Did he know I was watching? No, impossible. He was always looking up. He never once looked towards me or anywhere else. His entire focus was on the sky.\n\nLast night… the moon was incredibly bright. A full moon, lighting up the street almost like daylight. I went out onto the balcony, tense as usual. And I looked towards the abandoned house. There he was. Standing in his spot. The moonlight revealed him more clearly than ever before. I could see more details in his clothes. Dark jeans and a plain white t-shirt. His hair seemed dark, maybe a bit thick. But his face… still couldn't see it. Head tilted sharply upwards.\n\nIn that moment, I don’t know what came over me. Maybe it was desperation, maybe temporary insanity, maybe just the overwhelming need to break this stalemate and find out the truth. I found myself looking around the balcony. There were a few loose bricks and stones piled in a corner, left over from some old building repairs nobody ever cleared away.\n\nThe demon of curiosity, or maybe madness, whispered to me. If I threw something near him… would he look? Would he move? Would I finally know if he was real and not just a figment of my stressed-out mind? But then, if he was real and nobody else could see him, that was an even bigger problem. But I wasn’t thinking logically anymore. I just wanted any reaction. Any proof.\n\nI bent down, picked up a smallish stone, about the size of my fist. My heart was pounding like a drum against my ribs. My hand was shaking. I looked at him again. Still standing there, looking at the sky, lost in his celestial contemplation.\n\nI took a deep breath, raised my arm… and threw the stone. I wasn’t trying to hit him, of course. I aimed it so it would land on the roof beside him. Just to make a sound, hoping he’d turn.\n\nI watched the stone arc through the moonlit air, like it was moving in slow motion. It landed with a soft thud on the rooftop of the abandoned house, maybe a yard or two away from where he stood.\n\nIn that instant… everything stopped. The ambient sounds of the street faded from my ears. The breath caught in my chest. My entire focus locked onto him.\n\nFor the first time in months… he moved.\n\nBut he didn’t move the way I expected. He didn’t quickly lower his head to investigate the source of the sound. No. His head lowered with agonizing slowness. A terrifying, unnatural slowness. Like the neck of a machine turning on rusty gears. Degree by degree… centimeter by centimeter… his head descended and began to turn towards me. Towards my balcony.\n\nMy heart felt like it was going to stop. I wanted to scream and run and hide, but my body was frozen in place. I couldn’t move, couldn’t tear my eyes away from him.\n\nHis head completed its turn until it was facing me directly. And for the first time in months… I saw his face. Or what should have been his face.\n\nIn the shadows beneath his previously raised head, there weren't distinct features. But there was something else. Something that made my blood run cold and my knees buckle.\n\nHis eyes.\n\nHis eyes were glowing.\n\nNot just reflecting the moonlight. No. They were emitting a strong, white light. Like two small, intense flashlights aimed directly at me. A cold, terrifying light, devoid of any life or expression. Just pure white light pouring out from where his eyes should be.\n\nThe moment my gaze met his… or met the light emanating from his eyes… I felt an electric shock surge through my entire body. Raw, primal terror, unlike anything I had ever known. A feeling that this entity wasn’t just strange or mysterious… it was dangerous. Extremely dangerous.\n\nI don’t know how my legs carried me. I found myself scrambling back into the apartment like a madman, slamming the balcony door shut, rattling down the blinds, pulling the curtains closed. I ran to the front door, checked that it was securely locked. I went around to every window in the apartment, shutting them, closing all the curtains. I was breathing heavily, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. Sweat drenched me, and I was trembling like a leaf.\n\nI ended up sitting in the middle of the dark living room, hugging my knees to my chest, shaking uncontrollably. My mind couldn’t process what I had seen. Those glowing eyes… that wasn't human. That wasn't natural. That was something else entirely. Something I had been watching for months, thinking it was unaware… or I hoped it was unaware.\n\nAfter some time, I don’t know how long, maybe an hour or more, with fear completely paralyzing me, I started to calm down just a little. But the terror didn't leave. I decided I had to look again. I had to know if he was still there or if he’d left. Maybe what I saw was a hallucination brought on by extreme fear and stress?\n\nI crept towards my bedroom window with extreme caution. I opened a tiny sliver of the curtain, just enough to see out without being seen. My heart started hammering again. I looked towards the roof of the abandoned house…\n\nNobody.\n\nThe roof was empty. The spot where he always stood showed no trace of him.\n\nI felt a momentary wave of relief… immediately followed by a much larger wave of dread. Where did he go? Did he vanish? Did he come down? But how could he come down when the house was sealed?\n\nMy eyes scanned the area around the abandoned house… and suddenly… I caught movement.\n\nNot on the roof of the abandoned house. No.\n\nOn the roof of the building next door to mine. My neighbor's building, in the same row as my apartment block. Much, much closer.\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nIt was him. The same man. The same clothes. Standing with the same stillness. But this time… he wasn't looking at the sky.\n\nHe was looking directly at me.\n\nStanding on my neighbor's roof, which is practically adjacent to my building, his face turned directly towards my apartment window. And his eyes… they were still glowing with that same cold, terrifying white light. As if he knew exactly where I was peering from behind the curtain. As if he was saying:\n\n \"I saw you. And I know you see me. And I know where you are.\"\n\nI yanked the curtain shut instantly and stumbled backward, feeling nauseous. The terror I felt in that moment was exponentially worse than the initial fear. Before, he was a distant, mysterious entity. Now, he was a terrifying entity, close by, aware of my existence, and aware of my location.\n\nIt's my fault. I'm the one who drew his attention. With my stupid, impulsive action, throwing that stone, I made him look at me, made him discover me. He was just standing there, minding his own business, looking at the sky, and nobody noticed him but me, and like an idiot, I was watching him. Now he's the one watching back. But his gaze says it's not just watching.\n\nI've been holed up in my apartment for two days now. I don't open windows or the balcony door. All the curtains are drawn. I'm afraid to even get close to any opening to the outside world. I ordered food delivery and opened the door terrified, peering frantically down the hallway. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that white light pouring from his eyes, staring at me.\n\nI can feel him. I feel like he's still out there. Standing on the neighbors' roof, waiting for me to make a mistake and open a curtain, waiting for me to show myself. I feel his gaze penetrating the walls.\n\nI don't know what to do. Call the police? Tell them what? There's a guy with glowing eyes standing on my neighbor's roof staring at me? They'll think I'm on drugs or certifiably insane. Who can I tell? Who would believe me?\n\nI wrote all this down here because I feel like I'll go crazy if I keep it inside. Maybe someone here has gone through something similar? Maybe someone knows what this could be? Any explanation? Any advice?\n\nI'm so scared. Scared of what comes next. Scared that he won't just keep standing there looking. I feel like this was just the beginning. And that what I did opened a door I'm not remotely prepared to deal with.\n\nI think I hear faint footsteps on the stairs outside my apartment door right now… No, no, I must be imagining it… There's nothing there… right?\n\nI have to go now. I need to turn off the lights and stay quiet. Please, God, help me."},"54":{"title":"Maybe therapy isn't for everybody","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ket6vm\/maybe_therapy_isnt_for_everybody\/","flair":"Self Harm","author":"bloodoftheforest","selftext":"\"It's just that sometimes I feel... not great. Sad, I guess. Yeah, sometimes I feel sad.\"\n\nI focused intently on my own hands, completely unable to look at Dr Melanie. My nails seemed too long. When did I last cut them? I needed to remember to trim them when I got home tonight. Wait, did I actually have nail scissors or had Alex taken them wh-\n\n\"You mourn,\" Dr Melanie replied though that certainly wasn't the way I'd phrased things, \"that's understandable. What do you do when you feel that way? Do you have coping mechanisms such as talking to others or are you less happy with your response to these feelings?\"\n\nI laughed quietly and without humour before stopping myself. I didn't want to treat Dr Melanie disrespectfully. Melanie wasn't even her real name, her real name had another couple of letters in it. But I'd misheard her the first time and instead of being annoyed with me for getting it so wrong she'd simply clarified her actual name, an unfamiliar word with a p in it somewhere, and said that calling her Melanie was completely fine. She'd been so patient with the glacial pace I'd taken to even this surface layer of 'opening up.' All in all, she seemed nice, professional and understanding.\n\n\"I... no. I don't talk to people. I can't. I want to open up to friends but it seems like either they aren't ones to talk about their feelings or they are but their problems are so much bigger than mine, you know? I have a friend who lost his kid. I can't... So, anyway, I thought maybe I could talk to strangers online but that seems difficult. Not technologically, I can work a computer. It's just awkward. You're the first person I've really talked to.\"\n\nMy eyes flicked up to Dr Melanie, searching her for some sort of emotional response. I think I was looking for judgement. I'd told myself that I was finding myself a therapy session in order to work out how to feel better but I think that was a lie. It was a lie I'd believed, or least sort of believed, but part of me had wanted to see a therapist so that they could assess me, so they could tell me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and it would be objective, professional fact. Instead she was just watching me, patiently waiting for me to go on.\n\n\"Oh, the coping mechanism thing. Not really. Kind of. I have one but it isn't good. It isn't bad, it's just... weird.\"\n\n\"Go on.\" Dr Melanie encouraged.\n\n\"I don't live nearby, I live outside of town. And there are some woods nearby and if I walk into them I can keep walking until the closest person is maybe a mile away. Nobody can hear me out there. So I just... scream.\"\n\nWith that I was back to not looking being able to look Dr Melanie in the eye, my gaze burning away at the clock on the wall instead.\n\n\"Does it help?\"\n\nI was so ready to be ridiculed that it took me a second or two to process the question.\n\n\"Oh. Not really. It seems like it should beforehand but then I do it and it seems like it just isn't *enough*. It seems like I need to be able to scream louder or longer than I can or need a whole choir to scream with me or something. It doesn't make sense but it seems like it could help if only I was *more.*\"\n\n\"You only have one mouth to scream with. More mouths would help.\"\n\nI laughed again, but it felt a little less constrained than it had earlier.\n\n\"Yeah, more mouths would help.\"\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nBy the time I exited my session I felt a little better but this improvement vanished almost as soon as I entered the waiting room. There was a woman there, pale and shaking with patches of wetness all over her long sleeved top. The woman could not stop crying. She was quiet but her eyes were constantly leaking tears that she dabbed away at with the cuffs of her sleeves.\n\n*See,* I thought to myself, *she has real problems. Not like you.*\n\nI realised that I'd been staring and hurried away out of the door. The drive home was miserable, a familiar pressure building inside me. Once I got home I only went inside for a moment before heading out to the woods. I walked so quickly it was almost a run in parts and listened for a second once I reached my destination. So far nobody had ever been out walking in the area when I'd decided to have a screaming session but every time I was struck with a slight feeling of paranoia.\n\nThe next thing I did was crazy, I know that. I'm not a crazy person it just felt right. It felt like it was going to work.\n\nI took the pocket knife out from my jacket and unfolded the blade. I wasn't going to use it to hurt myself, not like that. I just thought that if I used it then it would make me better at screaming. I looked myself over for a suitable location and settled on my left forearm close to the elbow. Not the wrist, that's for self harm and suicides and it wasn't like that. I truly believed that what I was doing was different. I gritted my teeth and let the blade dig itself in.\n\nWhen I pulled the knife away the result was confusing, to say the least. There was a lot less blood than I would've expected. I hadn't stopped at a shallow depth so I should have expected there to be a lot of blood but instead, I'd had papercuts that bled more.\n\nThe weirder thing though, was that I could see something white there. My initial thought was that I'd somehow cut deeply enough to reach a bone but then I saw the gaps and realised I was wrong. Well, partially wrong. Teeth are bones, right?\n\nThe wound gaped and then ungaped. *It's a mouth,* I realised, *but it's not quite...*\n\nI ran my finger over the four visible teeth.\n\n*It's not done.*\n\nI let my knife widen the corners of this new mouth, stopping when I reached flesh. It's a ludicrous sentence because *the whole fucking thing* should have been flesh but there you have it. There was a point both ways where the blade would suddenly feel more resistance and pain would shoot from the area as if I was actually being cut and I knew that meant that the mouth was finished.\n\nI just stared at it at first. There were no lips but the teeth looked normal and when it opened slightly I was sure I saw a tongue in there. But I didn't do all of this just to stare at the mouth, I realised. I took a deep breath that I felt in my arm as well as my throat and then I went for it.\n\nOnce the screaming had concluded I was shocked how much *better* it felt. Not how much better *I* felt, but the screaming itself felt so much closer to making me feel better today than it had any time previously. I walked back with my hand over my new mouth, worried that somebody would notice it if they somehow passed by. I would need a long sleeved shirt next time, I reasoned. Or perhaps I should pick a different part of myself to open.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \nThe world was a little blurry for a while, as I followed my strange new form of self improvement. I don't think I'm ever going to remember what happened in that period aside from those moments that happened within the woods. I know, from the evidence I've collected since then, that I continued to work from home. I also know that this work was below my usual level, though thankfully not bad enough that it got me fired. There's something else I know about that time too, something I almost never realised at all.\n\nIt was a stupid game that first made me suspicious of Dr Melanie. It had had some big update that I didn't have room for on my phone so I went through to see what could be deleted. That's when I found the recordings. I'd always intended to record my sessions with Dr Melanie so I could play them back and write down any advice from them at a future date. It wasn't alarming to see one recording labelled 'Therapy' but what shocked me was that there were *eight* of them.\n\n\"That can't be right...\" I muttered to myself, but the more I thought about it the more sense it made.\n\nSome of the details of the sessions didn't make sense if there'd been only one. I thought I remembered looking at a clock during my 'only' session but I can also clearly recall entering that same room on my first session and being surprised that the only objects in the room were two chairs -- no clock, no desk, no tissues that I'm sure were there later...\n\nThe waiting room had had different people in too. I'd never seen more than one person waiting there but if that was true then how could I so clearly remember different figures? Hell, the more I thought about it the more I remember wondering why they had a waiting room that large when aside from the receptionist I'd only ever seen one person or nobody waiting whenever I'd left.\n\nI opened one of the recordings at random, only avoiding the first one.\n\n*\"Do you mourn?\" Dr Melanie's voice asked.*\n\n*\"I mourn.\" I'd apparently replied.*\n\n*\"When you scream, is it enough?\"*\n\n*\"No.\"*\n\n*\"It will be soon. You need more mouths.\"*\n\nThat was the complete recording. It seemed like some of the earlier ones were longer but the more recent ones were all under a minute. What the hell? Also, did her comment mean that she knew about the mouths? Was she the one doing this somehow? Her voice had sounded wrong. It was the same voice I remembered but there was too much of it, almost as if there were multiple Dr Melanie's speaking at once.\n\nA helpful alert on my phone informed me that I should leave for therapy in ten minutes, an alert that I had presumably set myself. A quick glance showed that I had also set myself alerts and reminders for the eight previous sessions. Perhaps the most concerning thing was that today's session was labelled 'Last therapy session.'\n\n\"Oh, fuck that.\" I told myself.\n\nWho the hell would go to see Dr Melanie, knowing what I knew?\n\nUnfortunately, wondering who'd be stupid enough to see her was the very thought that made me realise I had to go. I hadn't been the only person seeing Dr Melanie. She might not have many patients but I'd definitely seen others waiting for my session to be over so that they could go and talk about their own problems. Was she doing the same thing to them? If she was, would they be any more likely to remember it than I had been?\n\nMy new mouths didn't like to be covered but I switched my shorts and T-shirt for the most loose fitting items I could find that would hide them all. A glance at my watch told me that the time I had spent changing clothes and convincing myself to leave meant I was now running late for my session but it wasn't as if I was actually heading there to receive therapy. I had to protect Dr Melanie's other patients from whatever it was she'd been doing to us. I drove as fast as I could to her office.\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nIt was only when I left the car that I made another grim realisation about Dr Melanie's practice: she'd chosen somewhere so out of the way that it would be difficult to get any kind of help out to us quickly if I needed it. Dr Melanie hadn't chosen somewhere as isolated as my woods to set up office but a lot of the buildings nearby had closed their businesses long ago. When I'd first come out here I'd assumed the rent must just have been cheap but I was beginning to suspect the choice of location may have been driven by more sinister motives.\n\nI wasn't even that close by when I began to hear it. It was just an orchestra of agony. There were screams but they didn't have the short panicked bursts of somebody in immediate danger and the closer I got the more I could hear other noises. There was sobbing, wailing, muttering. I don't know what point I'd broken into a sprint but I reached the doors almost breathless. I threw them open and there Dr Melanie was, surrounded by her other patients.\n\nThere were so many people. I don't actually know how many patients a therapist would usually see but the waiting room that had always seemed so large and empty was now as crowded as a concert. Every patient that I could see was like me. They didn't all have multiple mouths but all of them had changed in some way. At one point during my struggle to push forwards towards Dr Melanie I saw the crying woman I'd noticed after my first session. Now that she was wearing a sleeveless dress I realised why her top had been so wet when I'd first seen her that day -- her arms were covered in steadily crying eyes. Even through the chaos of the other noises I could hear the gentle noise as each tear hit the floor. I turned away from her and pushed ahead.\n\n  \nDr Melanie was stood on the desk of the receptionist, a woman who was currently slumped silently forwards, her long hair a carpet beneath the therapist's feet.\n\n\"You came to me.\" Dr Melanie said.\n\nHer voice was so soft that I shouldn't have been able to hear it but, like the sounds of the tears from before, it was perfectly clear. I could isolate every sound in the room, in fact. Outside it had been chaotic but now I was in the middle of it all every note of pain and sadness from the other patients was together but seperate in an overwhelming melody.\n\n\"Do you mourn?\" she asked.\n\n*What did you do to me?* I tried to yell.\n\n\"I mourn.\" came my actual response.\n\n\"I think you have enough mouths now.\"\n\n*What are you?* I tried to ask.\n\nBut it was pointless. The pressure inside me had risen to an unbearable level with every step I'd taken and I could feel my new mouths open beneath the fabric of my clothes. I shook my head but I already knew there was nothing else to be done. I breathed in deeply like some sort of flute, air entering my body in impossible ways.\n\nThen I screamed.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to paint. I wasn't even particularly good but I used to adore that moment where I would add one final detail and be able to see that the work in front of me was now complete. The sound of my screaming was like that. I was the final instrument in her orchestra, my notes the only thing the melody that pressed around me could possibly have been missing.\n\nI thought she'd kill me, now it was complete. That would have made both more and less sense than what actually happened, I suppose. Dr Melanie forced her fingertips into the fabric of her loose dress part way down her abdomen, just below her high belt. When her fingers were in as deeply as they could go she pulled them out to the sides and tore not just the fabric but herself. There was no skin below that dress, no blood when she ripped herself open. All I can remember seeing is a dim glow that got brighter and brighter as the sound was sucked from the room.\n\nIt felt like it was the silence that knocked me to the floor but really I suppose it was the effort from all of the screaming. Or maybe it was shock, I don't know. When I sat up I realised I was hardly in the minority and that more of us were lying or sitting than standing.\n\n\"Did...  you see where...  she went?\" I croaked painfully at the man to my right.\n\nHe shook his head 'no' and I pulled myself more upright, then used the desk to help myself stand. There was a man stood behind the desk holding the receptionist's head in his hands. Like me, he had been covered with mouths moments ago. Now the only thing unusual about his appearance was the blood on his arms and it didn't seem like much of that was his.\n\n\"Alive?\" I asked, my widened eyes on the receptionist's empty ones.\n\nI didn't receive an answer but there was no real need for a reply. Now her head had been lifted I could see the slit across the receptionist's neck just as clearly as the man whose hand currently supported the woman's chin. He pulled away sharpy and her head slammed back to the desk with a clunk. From the other side of the room I heard the door open as someone left. It felt wrong but I couldn't blame them. Some hushed conversations took place and more left. I couldn't take my eyes off the dead woman.\n\nSomebody tapped my shoulder and I turned to see the woman with the eyes. She only had a normal amount of eyes now though. Both her and the man by the desk had small cuts where their more unusual features had more recently been.\n\n\"You need to leave,\" the woman said, \"both of you.\"\n\nI didn't move.\n\n\"She's dead and none of us can explain this. Once everyone's gone I'll delete all of your contact details from the laptop and call somebody. I'll say I just came to my appointment and found her like this. They might not believe me but it's the best we've got s- hmm. Fuck. She is not logged in. Well, given that I am not a hacker and the police will definitely be able to get inside that one of you should just take it with you. Probably for the best anyway, a computer at a reception with no client details would look suspicious. No laptop could mean the killer stole it or something. Wait.\"\n\nHer eyes scanned the room for something and then she ran to grab a blue cardigan that somebody had left on one of the chairs.\n\n\"You,\" she said at the man behind the desk, \"use this to get the worst of the blood off you. It won't get it all off so don't touch anything until you're clean or far away. It will have both of your DNA on it so do something smart with it when you get home. Do not burn it unless you usually have regular fires, you're going to want your behaviour to be super normal for the next few days. Normal routine, normal internet history, normal purchases in shops. Thoroughly bleach anything you get her blood on but again, try and make everything look normal. All of this cleaning either needs to be somewhere you know nobody else can see you or be done in such a way that it looks normal. Do you understand all of that?\"\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"Great. If you drove, leave now. If you didn't then I'll see if any of the other stragglers drove here because I think that jumper has wiped away all of the blood we can reasonably expect but you still have some on you and so public transport would be ill advised.\"\n\nHe left and the woman turned to me.\n\n\"Okay, so if you could just grab the laptop whilst touching everything as little as possible then that would be great. It would be great if it was wiped but since that's out of the question, do not send it to somebody else to be wiped. We wa-\"\n\n\"I... Can...\" I said, my throat protesting at the words.\n\n\"You can wipe it? That would be great. Probably not a good idea to sell it afterwards though. Wait, if you can wipe it then can you access it? Do not under any circumstance contact the other patients.\"\n\n\"But!\" I protested and my voice finally gave out completely.\n\nI pointed at the door to Dr Melanie's office and then to the exit. It took the woman a moment to understand what I meant but then she sighed.\n\n\"We aren't going to find her. Finding a human can be difficult but is possible for trained professionals with resources who don't need to lay low. That thing wasn't human. We know that, right?\"\n\nShe was right. I pointed at her and gave my best questioning look.\n\n\"I don't know what specifically you're asking,\" she responded, \"but I'll do my best. I'm telling you what to do because I think the things I've said are our best chance of most of us getting off unscathed. I'm staying here because somebody has to. I don't know what will happen to me but I'm hopeful that they won't believe I did anything either.\"\n\nI couldn't tell if she was lying on this last point. Even if she was, there was nothing I could do about it. If I stayed here too then there would just be two of us arrested. I carefully unplugged the laptop and took it home.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nI considered contacting the other patients, despite what I'd been told. In the end though, I decided that the many-eyed woman had been right. Even if somebody in the room that day had seen what direction Dr Melanie had headed when she'd left, that wouldn't be enough to go on. I wiped it and kept hold of it, just as I'd been told to.\n\nAt first I thought somebody would come for me but that never happened. For a few months I was focussed on making sure that my life looked normal so that whoever investigated me would have nothing suspicious to find. I didn't miss any work and I met up with my friends when they asked to hang out so that I would look normal. Eventually I accepted that I wasn't a suspect. Cautious research doesn't confirm whether anybody was charged in relation to the receptionist's death but it doesn't seem anybody thinks I'm connected.\n\nI tried to look Dr Melanie up but I couldn't figure much out. The website I'd initially used to request a therapy session, a website that never claimed to be connected to her personally but to connect people in our area with therapists, disappeared when she did. Searching the address of the office doesn't show any businesses being there in recent years, therapists or otherwise. I tried listening to the recordings on my phone to get a better idea of how to spell her surname but they're all wrong now. Every one of them only has my words, with spaces where I know for a fact she was replying to me.\n\nIt took months for the shock of it all to wear off and once it did I had a different problem. That old familiar pressure built up inside me again but now the thought of screaming disgusted me and terrified me. I couldn't go out and yell in the woods after the things that yelling had put me through. So, I tried something new. I poured myself a drink, a little whiskey for what's to come. I searched online for a community who might believe what I'd gone through, no matter how strange, and I found one. This community, in fact. I took a longer sip of my drink and stretched my wrists.\n\nThen I began [to type.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Leavesandink\/)"},"55":{"title":"I'm trapped on the edge of an abyss.

I think she was too afraid that she’d break down crying and scare me, though. The goal was to make things seem as normal as possible. To not let me see the grown ups flinch.\n\nDad though; he could always smile through the worst of times. No matter how dire the situation, he always found a way to keep it up. Just this soft, warm grin that could calm storms and set pounding hearts at ease. My dad smiled so much that I’m almost certain some people thought it was a façade; a presentation to give the impression that he was fine, and so was everything else. It wasn’t though. Somehow, he just managed to wring enough good out of any situation to still find the strength.\n\nHe wasn’t smiling that day he told me, though, and that scared me more than anything.\n\nHe may not have been smiling, but he wasn’t frowning either. He was plain. A vacant, plain expression that almost stared through me as my tiny figure stood before him.\n\nFinally, unable to take the unease any longer, I softly muttered, “Dad?”\n\nThat was enough to pull him back down to earth, and also bring that signature grin back to his face, if only for a moment.\n\nOnly for a moment…\n\nHe opened his arms as he sat on the couch and nodded to me, “Come here, Henny. Come sit on my lap.”\n\nThe return of his usual demeanor emboldened me, and I crossed my arms with a bratty huff. I had just turned seven, and I was a big girl now. I didn’t sit on my dad's lap anymore, and I made sure to tell him all of this.\n\nDad just chuckled and insisted, saying, “That may be, but you’re still a little girl to *me.* You won’t be forever, though, and someday I won’t be able to hold you anymore.” He leaned in close and scowled his eyes playfully, “Then, you’re going to regret not getting all the hugs you could have.”\n\nMy seven-year-old brain weighed his words carefully, and ultimately decided that the idea of one day not getting my father's world famous snuggles was, in fact, more terrifying than not being a ‘big girl’.\n\nI hobbled over to him, to which he scooped me into his arms, setting me on his knee and holding me tightly from behind. His breathing was shaky and exhausted, and I could tell he was too, as he lulled back against the sofa.\n\nAfter a pause that lasted far too long, he shakily said, “Your mama is sick, Henny.”\n\nI didn’t know what he meant by that. I was confused why he was bothering to tell me; mom got sick all the time—we all did. Still, I had enough sense even then to gauge from his voice that it was much more serious than that.\n\nAll I could think to say was, “Is she okay?”\n\nDad kissed my head, and I could hear a slight rasp to his voice as he told me, “Well, not quite. She’s really sick this time. Not the kind of sick that you get when you have to stay home from school.”\n\n“What kind of sick is it?”\n\n“It’s um… It’s called cancer.”\n\nYou know, it’s funny. When you’re a kid and you don’t know the meaning of a word, they always sound so harmless. No weight or danger attached to them. To me, cancer was just a word that I sometimes heard adults use. It was always in hushed whispers, or followed by a slew of apologies and pity sounds, but I didn’t know why. I remember I thought it sounded fun, like ‘dancer’.\n\nIt wasn’t until I heard my dad say it in that aching voice, and in a context involving mom, that it fully hit me how bad it was.\n\n“What is that?” I asked quietly, folding my chin into his forearms, as if they’d protect me from this new, scary monster.\n\n“Well, it’s… It’s a real bad sickness. A sickness that hurts people.”\n\n“How does it hurt people?”\n\nDad didn’t answer at first, thinking of how to put it best, “You see your skin?” he began, tapping my arm with a finger, “That, and all the stuff under it is made of tiny little living things called cells.”\n\nThat concept blew my mind, and I turned to my dad in mortified disbelief, “My skin is alive?”\n\nDad couldn’t help but chuckle, “Sort of. Why don’t you imagine your body as a big factory, and the cells are the little workers inside that keep you nice and healthy.”\n\nI stared at my arm in wonder, but didn’t interrupt.\n\nDad’s tone turned back to a more solemn one, and he cleared his throat, “Those cells get old though, and need to replace each other eventually, so they make more. Sometimes, a bad one sneaks in.”\n\n“Cancer?” I mumbled softly.\n\nDad nodded, “Cancer cells get confused. Instead of helping the body, they start to attack it. They make the factory start to shut down, and if too many of them get made, then well… it does.”\n\nMy stomach felt sick at that, even though I don’t think I understood the weight of it. That was evidenced by my next sentence, “Is there medicine we can give her to make her better?”\n\nDad took a deep breath, then lifted me up, spinning me around on his lap to face him. Looking me in the eyes, he did his best to not break, “Cancer is confusing, Henny. It’s like those snakes you try to catch in the garden; slippery and hard to pin down. The doctors have different ways to try and find it to get it out, but it also hurts the person who has it.”\n\n“So it would hurt mama?”\n\nDad didn’t respond, he just brushed a hand through my hair, “Mama’s strong. She’ll be okay. But it’s going to take a long time for her to heal. She has a lot of those bad cells in her body.”\n\n“How did she get so many?”\n\nI could feel dad shrug his arms, “I don’t know. Sometimes they just happen.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Why did she not feel them sooner?”\n\n“Well, we just didn’t…” dad started before something hit him hard. His voice broke, and he pulled in a breath that was shaky, trying to hold back a sob, “I don’t know.”\n\nI had so many questions still. Kids are notorious for that. We could ask ‘why’ to everything until all the knowledge in the universe was imparted to us, then still find one more to toss in. But like I said, seeing my father upset scared me, so I shut up and sat still in his lap, silently looking at the ground in thought while he buried his neck into my hair and gently wet it with tears.\n\n“Hensley?” Hope called over her shoulder, looking back at me and shining my phone light. We’ve been together long enough now that I more than trusted her with it.\n\nI had spaced out and stopped moving during a walk to the vending machines. We’d finally run out of food, and since we’ve been a lot more physical lately moving bodies, we were burning through it much faster. We were heading there with an intent to finally smash it open and take everything inside, but I’d got lost in thought the moment my eyes met with the glowing parking lot of the play place just down the road.\n\n*Zanes Jammin’ Jungle.*\n\n“You okay?” Hope's smile faltered.\n\n“Yeah—sorry, just…”\n\nHer eyes traced my own, then she frowned and nodded her head toward the motel, “Come on, let’s keep moving. We’re about due for a creature soon.”\n\nI nodded, then joined her side before continuing down the road.\n\n“I don’t get it,” she said as we moved, her eyes also now focused on the sinister fragment of the past, “Why that place? I’ve barely even thought about it since we were kids.”\n\n“Well, that’s another difference between us, I guess,” I sighed under my breath.\n\n“Fond birthday?” she asked.\n\n“No. But the day after sticks in my mind pretty well.”\n\nHope shamefully looked at the sidewalk and didn’t respond, clearly feeling dumb for not putting two and two together.\n\nI winced a little to myself, awkwardly fidgeting with my oversized coat sleeves. Since her arrival, Hope had been working double time to keep the spirits high for both of us, and I hadn’t exactly been pulling my weight. If anything, I’d been infecting her with my negativity.\n\nTrying to cheer her up, I bumped her shoulder with mine, “You’re probably right, though. Mom would have wanted the birthday to be what stuck more.”\n\nShe smiled only faintly, but her eyes at least drew back up. She spoke a few moments later, “Hey, Hen… what am I?”\n\nThe question caught me off guard, but admittedly, it was to be expected, eventually. Since we’d met, it’d always been on our minds, there had just been far more important issues at hand that we needed to sort out first.\n\nNow, in the dead space of routines, we finally had our moment.\n\nYou’d think with all that time to think, I’d have come up with a better response than, “Oh, um, well, you’re me, aren’t you? I thought we already knew that.”\n\n“No, I know, but… *what* am I?” She snickered softly, “Like, we look the same and talk the same and have all the same memories, but we clearly don’t think the same. I should have made that connection too about Zane’s, it was an important moment in my life just as much as yours. Is it… bad that it didn’t even come to mind?”\n\n“Hope, what?” I said, feeling guilt in my stomach for spiraling her down this hole, “No; you’re fine—you’re, um, great.”\n\nShe gave me a look that told me she didn’t believe my words.\n\n“Listen, that day after our party was obviously not a good one, and you’re the much more optimistic of us two. Of course your mind wouldn’t have gone to the dark place like mine did.”\n\n“Okay, but what does that make me, then?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I tossed my hands up with a chuckle, trying to find the right words to diffuse her concern, “I mean, you came from me. Like, literally *came out* of my body. Maybe that means you’re just another part of myself. This place clearly is making imprints of bits and pieces from people's lives, you’re probably just a fragment of who we are.” Realizing that didn’t sound the most flattering, I turned to her and sincerely added, “Clearly all the best parts of me.”\n\nThat was enough to make her smile, then shake her head, “Shut up. You’re fine, Hen. If I came out of you, then that means everything I am is just as much you as me.”\n\nI snickered, “Yeah. Sure. That’s why I’m *so* much fun to be around.”\n\n“You’re *fine,*” Hope reiterated before falling back to silence. It took her a beat to work up the courage for her next question, “So… what happens when we get out of here?”\n\nI swallowed, then said, “Huh, what do you mean?”\n\nI knew exactly what she meant.\n\nShe clearly sensed my nerves, “D-Don’t worry; I’m not, like, panicked about it or anything. There’s a good chance when we leave I might just like… stop existing? I guess that’s best-case scenario.\n\n“Hope, that’s not best case…” I told her. “You’re a person too, now.”\n\nShe turned to me and made a joke that honestly surprised me coming from her, “It’s fine, Hen. We’ve come to terms with dying a long time ago, right?”\n\nI frowned, but couldn’t find words to retaliate with before she spoke again.\n\n“But if that doesn’t happen then, like… what then? You’re just going to have another you walking around, and that might get complicated.”\n\n“Great. Just what the world needs: more of me,” I joked half heartedly.\n\n “Hensley… I’m serious.” Hope prodded, “I won’t have any legal identity; I couldn’t just go off and make a life of my own very easily. And besides there's—”\n\nShe started to say something else, but quickly cut it off.\n\nI wasn’t about to let it slide, “What? There’s what?”\n\n“Nothing. I guess we don’t really need to get into it right now…”\n\n“Hope,” I continued digging.\n\nShe sighed and threw her head back, almost looking guilty for her next words. She hugged herself and spoke, “I don’t know—I guess there’s just everyone else? Like, I’m you, Hen. I still love our family and friends and… and Trevor. It would just suck to leave him, but… we can’t both be in the picture.”\n\nI stared at her with my mouth parted slightly, a sick feeling heavy in my stomach. “Hope, let’s… Not worry about that right now. We’ll figure it out when we get out of here.” I moved and hesitantly placed a hand on my clone's shoulder, “They’re going to love you just as much as me. If we proved to them what happened and that you’re really me, they would never turn you away.” Trying to lighten things, I added, “Plus, I don’t think Trevor would mind having two of the woman he loves around.”\n\nIt got a snicker from her, but she shook her head, “Eh, he’s not like that. He’d still want only you. You’re right, though. I guess we should figure this out once we get out.”\n\n“N-No, we can talk about it if you want, I was just—”\n\n“Seriously, it’s okay, Hen!” Hope smiled bright and far too convincingly, “One step at a time here.”\n\nWe finally arrived at the machines right as our conversation finished, and though I was still worried about Hope, I didn’t want to push things, so I turned back to the task at hand. I was a little confused when I did, however.\n\n“Alright, you ready to break these suckers open?” she questioned.\n\n“Hang on, that’s not right…” I muttered.\n\n“What? What’s up?”\n\n“These rows were empty last time I was here,” I explained, pointing to a lane of chips, “I cleaned it all out; bought their whole stock. Why are they back?”\n\nHope furrowed her brow, “Are you sure?”\n\n“Dead sure. The weird thing is, that one has a new kind of chips,” I said, tapping on the glass.\n\n“Is it… being restocked?”\n\nI snorted, “Yeah, the regular maintenance man of the abyss is stopping by to make sure.”\n\nHope shot me a glare, then elaborated, “I *mean* maybe through some other means, dummy. The imprint map has these listed as a research site; maybe they’re special somehow.”\n\n“Maybe *they*’*re* imprints of some kind.” I ventured.\n\n“Elaborate, please.”\n\n“Well, there’s the giant building from our childhood that showed up here,” I started turning and pointing to it in the distance, “So obviously things from the past can show up here. Like an imprint.”\n\n“Right,” Hope nodded.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about the bodies lately and how they’re singing and talking. They sound like recordings of different life events. That first one we found said ‘I love you’ to somebody who said it back, then romantic music started playing, remember? Then there was that um… unsettling one where—”\n\n“No! Nope. We don’t need to talk about that.” Hope said pressing her hand to her ears.\n\nWe’d found a corpse recently that wasn’t spouting random phrases or songs like the others, although to call it a corpse might be an overstatement. When we arrived at its location in a small hardware store, it was merely a vile, sticky, rotting puddle on the floor, filled with bone and hair and bits of flesh.  The only identifiable things left were small digits like fingers and toes and a single ear floating in the gore.\n\nWe almost left it and just went to a different one, but the dots on the map were already getting thin the more we ticked them off one by one, and the hatch meter was still not even a quarter of the way full. We couldn’t afford to pass any up, and besides, we already had a set method to sweeping the town, so we decided not to change things up now.\n\nWe grabbed some respirator masks from a shelf of the store (something we honestly should have done a long time ago) then some snowplow shovels before heading back to the body. Hope and I ‘rock-paper-scissored’ for who got one job, and I ended up losing, making me have to shovel the goo up while she held the trash bag open. It was all either of us had not to puke at the crackling noise of flesh peeling from the floor, but that quickly became the least disturbing thing.\n\nAs we disrupted the body, it began to wake up. They usually don’t start making noise until Hope and I begin jostling them around, but this one did nearly instantly. It sounded foggy and warbled, as if the means by which it spoke was broken.\n\n“No… no, no, God please! Please!”\n\nThere was the frantic sound of shoes pounding across the concrete floor, but then I heard an abrupt slamming noise, and the man let out a grunt. There was more sounds filling the space with him, something moving toward him.\n\nSomething that sounded like cracking bones and snapping branches as it moved. I could hear whispers filling the air along with them.\n\n The man let out some more desperate pleas for help and cries for mercy in a voice so primal and filled with fear that my body locked up in horror.\n\n“No! No, no, no—please! Please I—”\n\n*CRUNCH.*\n\nThe noise was sharp and sudden. One loud clap of something crushing the man in the flash of an instant. I could hear him gurgle and gasp in surprise, but it wasn’t over.\n\n*CRUNCH, CLOMP.*\n\nIt sounded like two massive boards of wood being pounded together with the man inside. I could hear his bones and flesh being ground up and pummeled to paste as it happened, and all the while he tried to make more sounds. My head spun and felt nauseous as I thought I heard him attempt to call out for his mother, but it only came out in an incoherent gurgle that nobody would hear. Then, finally—\n\n*CRUNCH.*\n\nAnd the memory was over.\n\nBut that’s not how the bodies here work; they don’t just stop then go silent. They ramble over and over and over again until we throw them down the chute. Normally, they have multiple memories and sounds that they cycle through, but whatever happened to that man, it had to have been so horrifying that it was only part of him that could stain into this place.\n\nIt was the only thing that played until we got the body to the hatch.\n\nThe worst part was that it didn’t even fill the imprint gauge at all. All we got was a brand new fear.\n\nThat wasn’t the only case of that, however. The same exact thing happened when we went back to retrieve Juarez’s legs. The same memory of something with stiff, cracking joints and menacing whispers that follows its wake. His wasn’t nearly as bad as the puddle, only the sound of the tower skylight smashing then shaking breath. One clap of it cleaving his body in two, and then the memory was over.\n\nThat one hadn’t stuck in Hope’s head as much because Juarez at least seemed to have some other happier memories that balanced out the horror as we walked him to the hatch. Both cases certainly stuck in mine, however.\n\nYou may have already put two and two together, but that creature? The one that I heard in both those dead man tales? It was the same one I dreamed about. The same thing that I heard in my last post.\n\nOnce I realized that, I went back and reread the notes that we’d found. I couldn’t sleep that night and needed to make sure I wasn’t just inflating things in my mind. Unfortunately, I wasn’t.\n\nIn Brand's letter, they mentioned the creature that killed their team coming back up to the shelf with its ‘Maddening whispers and clattering bones’. It’s a perfect match.\n\nI don’t think Hope has put those two things together, and I don’t have the heart to tell her that whatever killed those two people is what’s coming back eventually to kill us. And whatever it is, it’s so horrifying that Brand took an easier way out just to avoid it, and Juarez let it take him because he thought he deserved it more than hell.\n\nI’m more terrified now than ever. We need to get out of this place.\n\nAnyway, all of this is to say that I’d begun forming theories of the shelf based on the bodies.\n\n“What if this place is like one big notebook or something?” I asked her, “Like, everything that has been here or passed through leaves a mark on it somehow.”\n\n“That’s not a bad theory…” Hope answered, “And maybe it’s like, the harder you press, the more you leave behind? Like leaving grooves on the sheet behind the first one.”\n\n“Yeah, exactly,” I nodded, “Maybe we’ve been here so long that that’s why Zane’s popped up.”\n\nHope placed a hand to her chin, “Maybe. But if that’s the case, then why does it seem like the scientists here didn’t have any real effect on the area. They must have been here a while.”\n\n“While, some equipment is broken. Maybe they had a way to control it or monitor it?”\n\n“Yeah, I guess that makes sense.” Hope nodded, turning back to the vending machine, “But back to the matter at hand, how does that involve the chips?”\n\n“Maybe the stuff that imprints here isn’t just after it enters. This town exists in the real world; I know because I drove through it before I started getting pulled into this place. Maybe this is part of the town outside that’s getting recorded in here too?”\n\nHope smiled, “Man, you’ve really been working at this, huh?”\n\nI scoffed and looked at my reflection in the snack machine glass, “Yeah, well, none of that is for certain. It’s all just guesses based on what we have so far.”\n\n“I think it’s good enough for now; it makes enough sense at least!” Hope said, patting my back, “So where does that leave us with these, then? We probably shouldn’t smash them, right?”\n\n“Why not?” I asked.\n\n“Well, what if it breaks that imprint?” Hope questioned, “Right now, we have infinite food so long as we keep using it the way you did the first time. If we’re here for much longer, we might need that. And besides, if we don’t make it out of here, and somebody else gets stuck, then… Well, it would be nice to pay it forward, you know?”\n\n“That’s awfully thoughtful of you,” I told her with a sarcastic smirk.\n\n“Well, we gotta look at this from all angles,” she sighed darkly before starting for the motel office doors.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To take out some cash,” she called over her shoulder with an amused grin.\n\nHer idea was good; there was a decent stack of cash in the rundown register. We couldn’t use a lot of the big bills on the machine, unfortunately, but there was enough 1’s and 5’s to get us stocked back up.\n\nAs I worked the bills and keypad on the machine, Hope kept watch on the tower, making sure that the light didn’t click on. I even bought some drinks this time so that we wouldn’t have to only keep drinking this places putrid water. We were nearing the end of our grocery shopping when something else caught our attention, however. We noticed it in the silence of me entering a new keypad combo.\n\nMusic filling the air; loud, but distant. We both looked over our shoulder toward the direction it was coming from.\n\nZane’s Jammin’ Jungle.\n\nThere was a jumpy, 60’s style rock tune blaring through speakers within that leaked through its walls and into the town. For as unsettling as the silence here had been, it was almost more eerie to hear noise coming from somewhere we weren’t occupying. We were the only ones here, after all.\n\nI looked to the tower light. Still off.\n\n“The power still works in there…” hope noted.\n\n“Makes sense. The parking lot is on, too. The building looks like it’s safe from this place's rot as well.”\n\n“Even so, who started the music?”\n\nI thought for a moment, listening hard to the tune. It was familiar. Somewhat nostalgic. I’d heard it before, long, long ago.\n\n“There’s that animatronic band,” I said, “They would always play every hour on the hour. Maybe it’s on a timer.”\n\n“Yeah,” Hope nodded, “That tracks.”\n\nI finished grabbing out the chips that had dropped while we were gawking and handed them to Hope, “Ready to call it for today?”\n\nShe crammed them into her pack, then slung it on, “Yeah. All this body upkeep is really taxing, mentally, and physically.”\n\nA little bit after we got back to the station, the light to the tower finally clicked on. Just in time, I suppose. The beast came from the top of the cliffs this time, something we learned recently could happen. It seems that even above us isn’t safe. We’re truly surrounded down here.\n\nHope and I paid little mind to it as it began moving through town on its hunt, however. It was quiet, thankfully, and we’ve gotten a lot more comfortable moving around the radio tower while beasts are in town. Whatever shield they put on this place, it stops things from even getting past the sidewalk to the building, so we figured we probably don’t need to hunch under desks for hours on end anymore.\n\nWe still hide if things get too close, though. Can’t be too careless.\n\nThe two of us went up to the main room to update our map. It’s much more bearable to be up there now that the scent has had time to air out. I’m still working out trying to fix machines in my free time, but not making much progress. This is high-tech lab equipment vs. a random girl from California, so, obviously you can tell how that match is going. I’m not giving up, though. I’m still seeing all of your comments listed on my posts, and I know that there’s gotta be something valuable that I’m missing by not seeing them.\n\nHope and I reached the imprint map then looked down at it with disappointed frowns. The dots were already wearing very thin, only a couple dozen left, and the meter by the machine by the door wasn’t even close to being filled up. The problem was, Hope and I didn’t even know what filling it would do, and even if we did get the door open and got to ‘the drill’, we didn’t know how much energy we’d need to power it. If it was a full tank, we were screwed, and considering that we were trying to punch a hole out of a hellish dimension, I’m guessing that’s the case.\n\nHope keeps trying to keep spirits high, though, “That’s okay. Some of these might be worth more than others. That one in that yellow house was worth quite a bit.”\n\nEven I couldn’t entertain her this time, “Hope… we need more.”\n\nShe bit her cheek and kept her eyes glued to the map, “Well, once we get them all, we can pivot to trying to get the door open. We can probably get some more clarity inside.”\n\nI sighed and leaned against the console to force myself in her view, “Listen, I know you’re scared, but you’re not dumb, Hope. There’s nothing left out here; we would have found it by now.”\n\nI pressed a finger to the rig 1 icon without looking.\n\n“We have to go into Zane’s. It’s clearly another place where these people were set up; there has to be clues in there. Maybe there’s a password to the laptop or something—that’s gotta have all the information we need.”\n\nHope put on a desperate face, “I know, Hen, but we don’t know what’s in there. There’s no protection like this tower. If we go in there and you die—”\n\n“Then fine,” I cut her off, a little frustration growing inside me, “We’re probably going to die anyway, so I don’t exactly see the harm in doing it early. We have to do something, though; I don’t see why you’re so concerned if I live or croak, considering that’s a given, even if we get out of here.”\n\nI fully expected her to raise her voice in return; it’s certainly what I would have done. Hope really is the better half of me, though, “I care if you die because you need to make it home. Dad and Trevor are waiting on you. That place is just too convenient—too real. Like it’s *trying* to lure you in. We can’t trust this place.”\n\nI couldn’t stop my anger from growing more, and my next words slipped out on pure impulse, “Oh really? Well, technically, *you* came from this place, so how do I know I can trust *you*? You seem like you’re trying awfully hard to keep me from making any real progress.”\n\nThe look of hurt on my own face made me internally wince, but it somehow hurt more that hope still didn’t lash back. She just sadly muttered, “I-I’m not trying to… I just wanted to…”\n\nI wanted immediately to comfort her. To say that I was sorry and that I didn’t mean that. I’ve been told that I’m stubborn at the worst of times, though, and my impulsive coldness always has a way of getting the better of me. I simply couldn’t force anything out.\n\n“Maybe you’re right,” Hope pitifully said, attempting to pull up a weak smile, “Let’s just… talk about this later? I’m going to go lay down. I’m tired.”\n\nFinally, I broke from my binds but it was too late, “Hope, I didn’t mean—”\n\n“No, it’s okay! Really,” she quickly reassured, moving backward for the door, clearly eager to escape, “shouldn’t be putting anything off the table. We need to take risks if we’re going to make it out of here.”\n\nI once again found I couldn’t respond, which only led to a very awkward, painful silence as Hope lay her hand on the doorknob and waited for a response. When I didn’t give one, she just nodded with a smile, then exited.\n\nImmediately, I let out a huff of frustration, then buried my hands into my face. Meanwhile, the beast on the shelf with us let out a strange, machine gun sounding cackle. Clearly, it found my suffering funny.\n\nIt took me a while before I left the tower room, then headed back downstairs, but I didn’t reenter the offices. It’s strange; when I first got here, I would have killed to have company, but now that I’d spent every waking moment with Hope the last few weeks, I suddenly found the desire to be alone.\n\nIt was less rooted in selfishness than it was self-loathing, however. I needed to be alone to stew with myself.\n\nI hated that I was like that. So easy to snap and vicious when there was resistance before me. Hope had been nothing but kind and helpful since she arrived and even solved several things about this place already. She didn’t need to be put on blast by the pitiful little bitch who only whines and complains. I really was the queen of that. Always have been. And then what did I do after I’d lash out and make people feel like shit?\n\nGo sulk and stew like I was doing right now.\n\nA consuming cycle. A horrible beast worse than the ones outside that I let devour me more and more each time I did it. Maybe it had already eaten me whole. After all, that was why I was here. One long, two week self-pity party on the road, pushing everyone I cared and loved away because I couldn’t handle the way *I’d* acted back home.\n\nI missed Trevor. I missed dad. I missed my other friends, even though I hadn’t reached out in months. Why couldn’t I just be Hope? Where was she all that time she was inside of me? The kind, sweet version of me that never angered or got upset?\n\nMaybe she was right about Zane’s. I have a tendency to be reckless; was this just another excuse for me to barrel into something blind again?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I knew it couldn’t be, though. If I was at least right about one thing, it had to be that. She had a point about it being too perfect, but that was the exact reason we had to go in there. This place wanted me to. It was like it wasn’t going to let us progress unless I played by its rules.\n\nFrom a more literal standpoint, it also made logical sense. The rigs were clearly designed to harvest something; probably for the drill. If there were clues on how it worked and how to operate the machine, they were in there.\n\nMy brain continued running logistics until it eventually fell back to the emotional. Hope had raised a great question; why Zane’s? The day was great for me as a kid, but it wasn’t anything special. I hardly remembered any details about it at all. If anything, shouldn’t something have appeared that mirrored the following day like I’d said? The much more impactful one.\n\nAs I dwelled on it, I couldn’t help but fall back into the memory. Sitting there with Dad. We’d sat there for a long time after he stopped talking. He held me, and I just awkwardly sat there like kids do, hugging him back but not quite understanding his emotions. I knew he was sad, but I didn’t realize then he was crushed.\n\nNo, my mind had been elsewhere. In the young, naïve questions about such affairs. This cancer thing, was it going to make Mom throw up a bunch like I did when I got sick? Dad said that if enough bad cells got in, the factory ‘shut down’, but how does a body just ‘stop working’? That didn’t make any sense to me. As far as I knew from movies, you had to get hit really hard or stabbed for you body to die.\n\nI remember one question in specific that felt important enough to ask, “Dad, can you get cancer too?” my voice barely above a mumble.\n\n“Hm?” he asked, lifting his head from my hair.\n\n“Can mama give you cancer too?”\n\nDad smiled and squeezed me tight, “No, don’t worry, Henny. Cancer isn’t a sickness like that.  It’s not contagious. We’ll be just fine, you and me.”\n\nI remember the way he said that so vividly. Filled with so much warmth and reassurance. I had been feeling sick and uneasy that whole time, since the moment he told me Mom was sick, but in that one instant, if only for a moment, he chased it all away. He had a way of doing that a lot throughout Mom’s decline. Easing the waters when they got too stormy.\n\nAs I grew up, I began to realize that his words weren’t concrete. Just because he said it in a way that calmed me down didn’t mean he was going to be right. I never held it against him, though, when things didn’t pan out well. Eventually, I just learned to appreciate that he was keeping his head up through the pain, and trying to do the same for me.\n\nIf Hope really is part of me, she’s gotta be everything that Dad taught me.\n\nMy phone was in my hand without me even realizing, contacts open and hovering over the first voicemail from my dad. Just like with Trevor, I was terrified to hear it, but I just needed his voice.\n\nTears were already falling before I tapped play.\n\n“Hey, Henny,” he said, a smile hidden in his tone. His voice was old and worn now, not like that day when I was 7 years old. Still, he talked with just as much warmth. “I, um, hear you’re out on the road. I hope you’re being safe.”\n\nThere was a long pause filled by the crackle of the phone's mic, my dad’s breathing and the silence between them.\n\n“Trevor, um, told me, Henny. About the diagnosis. P-Please don’t be mad at him; he was just worried about you since you’ve… well, you’ve been gone.”\n\nI could hear his smile give way to tears, his voice a hoarse crackle.\n\n“Listen, sweetie, you can talk to me always, okay? *Always*. I know you’re probably scared and confused and going through a lot right now. I know why you’d probably want to be out on that road alone, but… you aren’t going to find anything out there, Hen. I promise. Only a lot of loneliness and just more questions about yourself that you can’t answer.”\n\nI shut my eyes tightly and gritted my teeth. Why hadn’t I just checked my phone. Just one time on that damn trip?\n\n“Why don’t you come on home, okay?” Dad asked, smile back behind his words, “Come home, and we’ll work through this together. I love you, my little Hen.”\n\n“I love you too, Dad…” I whispered softly.\n\nThen voicemail ended.\n\nI let my phone fall to my lap, curling into myself as I let more soft sobs slip out of me. My joints ached in that position, and the muscles through my body burned and stabbed. I felt tired and fatigued.\n\nMy dad had a lot to explain that day he told me about cancer. It’s such an awful, complicated thing that it’d be impossible to cover it all in one sitting, especially to a little girl. He didn’t have time to explain chemotherapy in depth. He didn’t have time to warn me about all the awful things it does to a person and their body all in an attempt to uproot the thing slowly infecting your insides. He didn’t have time to tell me about the different types of cancer that can appear in all the different places. The brain, the lungs, the skin.\n\nIn the bones.\n\nHe didn’t tell me about the way it can spread to different parts of the body, and that there were stages to it. That if you didn’t catch it soon enough, and if it had already spread too far, it might already be too late to stop it.\n\nAnd the one thing that my dad didn’t explain to me when he told me that cancer wasn’t contagious was that there was a thing called heredities. He didn’t tell me that cancers, although rare, have a chance of passing down from parent to child.\n\nLike I said, though, I didn’t hold it against him when things didn’t pan out.\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin when I felt the couch sink next to me, and a pair of arms wrap my shoulders.\n\n“Sorry,” Hope muttered, “I didn’t mean to scare you.”\n\n“It’s okay,” I chuckled, wiping my eyes, “how long have you been here?”\n\n“Long enough,” she told me.\n\nI nodded, then caught my breath before speaking again, “I trust you, Hope. I didn’t mean that earlier.”\n\n“I know,” She smiled, “I’m you, remember? I know how we can be sometimes.”\n\nI snickered, then sat up, to which Hope leaned over fully, resting on my shoulder, “You were right, though. We need to go in there.”\n\nI nodded, but it was weak, “You were right too. It’s probably going to be dangerous. Maybe a trap.”\n\n“Well, whatever it is, we’ll make it through.” Hope told me, her eyes looking down at my phone, “We have to for them.”\n\nI nodded, then we both fell to silence, just taking a moment to rest before the impending storm.\n\n“I think I’ve figured out the answer to your question earlier. The one about why Zane’s is so important.” I eventually spoke.\n\n“Why’s that?” she asked softly.\n\n“I think that was the last day of my life that I remember being happy.”\n\nHope didn’t say anything in response. She didn’t agree or deny the words. She just hugged me tighter as my tears started up again, and we both sat there together through the night.\n\nThis is probably going to be my last update before we go into Zane’s. If I don’t post again soon, then… well, you can probably assume the worst. Don’t worry, though; I don’t intend on that being the case. Even if it does go down that way—if I don’t end up making it back out of that building from my youth—don’t mourn for me, okay? It was probably inevitable.\n\nAnd besides, at least I’ll be going down with a friend. That’s more than others who died here can say.\n\n \n\n "},"56":{"title":"The Night I Picked Up My Sister… Or So I Thought","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kefmzg\/the_night_i_picked_up_my_sister_or_so_i_thought\/","flair":null,"author":"Neat-Present-4387","selftext":"I live in India, in the Northeast region, surrounded by hills and winding roads. It’s beautiful, really—the kind of place where mist clings to the treetops and silence settles after dark like a thick blanket.\n\nThis happened just last week.\n\nI'm the middle child in my family. I live with my mom, dad, my younger sister—let’s call her M—and my older brother. It’s been the final stretch of my last semester, so I've been buried in books, stuck in my room most of the time. M had just finished high school and scored really well. Her class had a farewell dinner with their homeroom teacher to celebrate. My older brother dropped her off at the venue and came back home.\n\nI was deep in my studies, not really paying attention to what was happening outside my room. I only knew M was out for dinner.\n\nAround 9:40 PM, I suddenly got a call from her. I figured she needed someone to pick her up since my brother was at church—he sings in the choir. I asked her to send me the location. As soon as I got the address, I hopped on my bike and left to get her.\n\nHere’s where things start getting… weird.\n\nI had never been to the area she sent me. Completely unfamiliar. But I trusted Google Maps and followed the route. As I entered the area, everything was pitch dark—no streetlights, no signs of life. There were houses, but they looked abandoned. No lights, no sounds. I figured there must’ve been a blackout. I kept going.\n\nEventually, I reached the destination. It was a waiting shed on the side of the road. M was standing there in the dark. She got on the back of my bike without saying a word. That was strange—she’s usually bubbly, always telling me about her day.\n\nTrying to break the silence, I asked, “How was dinner?”\n\nShe didn’t respond. Maybe she was tired. Maybe something upset her. I didn’t push.\n\nOn the way back, just about a kilometer from our house—on a brighter, more familiar street—I ran into a friend standing on the side of the road. I stopped to chat for a second. He asked where I was coming from, and I told him I had just picked up my sister. He looked at me, kind of confused, then laughed as I joked, “Study hard or you'll fail!” and drove off.\n\nWhen we got home, I told M to hop off while I parked the bike in our separate garage. It was quiet. Too quiet. I called out again—nothing. I turned to check... and there was no one on the backseat.\n\nI froze.\n\nShe was gone. Just… gone. I didn’t hear her get off. Didn’t see her walk away. I looked around the garage, the driveway—nothing.\n\nI rushed inside the house. My brother was already home. I asked him, “Did M come in already?”\n\nHe looked confused. “No, she’s not home yet. Her friend’s dad just called and said he’s dropping her off now.”\n\nWait. What?\n\nRight then, M walked in—with her friend, who came in to use the bathroom.\n\nI looked at her, stunned. “Why did you call me earlier?”\n\nShe blinked. “I didn’t. I lost my phone on the way. Someone must’ve found it and called you.”\n\nWhat.\n\nI took my brother to my room and told him everything. He laughed it off, didn’t take me seriously. But I was dead serious. I even showed him the call history on my phone. The call was real. I showed him the location I went to. His face went pale.\n\n“That’s not inside the city,” he said. “That’s way outside.”\n\nAnd then it hit me—why didn’t I realize I was driving out of the city? I’ve lived here my whole life. I should have known. The road, the houses—I had never seen that area before. I decided to go back there the next day, just to see it in daylight.\n\nBut when I retraced my steps, everything was different. There were no houses. No waiting shed. Just trees and open ground.\n\nAnd the place where I picked up M? It was a graveyard.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough to mess with my head, later that night I took off my jacket and felt something heavy in the pocket. I reached in.\n\nIt was M’s phone.\n\nShe asked how I got it. I told her someone must’ve called me and I picked it up—simple. But then I asked how she could’ve dropped it outside the city. She said her class had dinner at a resort just beyond the city limits. It could’ve fallen there.\n\nStill confused, I called the friend I had run into that night.\n\n“Hey, do you remember seeing me with M?” I asked.\n\nHe replied, “Yeah, I saw you and we talked. But… your sister wasn’t with you, man. I remember being confused when you said you were picking her up. You were alone.”\n\nSo what did I see?\n\nWho did I pick up?\n\nAnd who… or what… called me that night?"},"57":{"title":"I've seen the same woman kill herself three times, how do I get her to stop?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kemvsw\/ive_seen_the_same_woman_kill_herself_three_times\/","flair":"Self Harm","author":"MrsSpaceCPT","selftext":"Hello Reddit!\n\nNot sure if this is the right sub to be asking about paranormal stuff.I think it's paranormal anyway. But if anyones an expert on ghosts, demons or even something dumb like creepy pastas, please feel free to take a swing at my problem.\n\nNow about that problem, it’s as simple as it sounds.\n\nAbout four months ago, I was walking home from college to my bus station. Listening to Lady Gaga and drinking a Pepsi max. I was tired -  having to deal with my bum of a professor for the last 4 days in a row so I was looking forward to the mildly comfy chairs of the old bus.\n\nI got to the station and waited for a long ass time before the bus finally arrived. I sat down at the very back on the left side and almost immediately drifted to sleep, Gaga being my only line of defence from complete slumber. \n\nI then saw her, she was this sad, ragged looking girl. With baggy eyes and a saggy face she just stared off into nothing. To be completely honest she was pretty similar looking to me, it was like looking at a version of me that had died and come back to life. She even had my same beautiful curly hair. She was sweating, I could see the large and thick droplets of sweat running down her face, clinging to the edge of her chin and her nose. Her hands were buried in her pockets of her hoodie and shivered relentlessly. \n\nI was admittedly very uncomfortable at the sight, who wouldn’t be? So I made an admittedly idiotic mistake. \n\nI spoke to her.\n\n\n\n“Are you ok?” I said removing my head phones and leaning in a little closer. Her spacy gaze quickly shifted to an intent stace at me, the quick snapping of her neck to face me made me jump back a little bit. Her face was angry, more angry than I thought was possible. It was like every level of hell was condensed into a single person and it was being directed to me. I pushed back against the bus window, as if I was trying to somehow move through the glass like a ghost.\n\nAnd then in one swift motion, she pulled out a short silver revolver, jammed it in her mouth and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe thick cloud of red mist erupted from her skull, her eyes quickly lost all soul that was behind them as her corpse fell to the side, brain matter, bone, skin, it was all leaking together into mush.\n\nThe police got involved, I had to double up on therapy and the general public just wrote what happened off as “just a random crazy who killed herself.”\n\nI honestly don’t remember much from the rest of the day, I was trying everything I could to just rationalise what I saw. Took me about one and a half months before I felt likeI could function again.\n\nBut, like a horrid twist of fate, that wasn’t the last time I saw her. \n\n\n\nAfter 2 months of the first suicide , it was like déjà vu. It was the same Gaga song, the same drink and the same day. As I got on the bus that day I felt another impossible sense of dread. I was scared she’d come back. And she did, she got onto the bus and sat in her same seat. But instead of talking to her, she spoke to me this time. \n\n“Why, why is this my fault?” She said, looking as if she was staring over my shoulder, staring at nothing. \n\n“What?” I asked her.\n\n“Why do you hate me?” She continued.\n\nJust as I was about to get another word in, she pulled out the revolver. I think you know the rest.\n\n\n\nI didn’t take the bus the next time. I instead chose to walk 3 whole hours just to get home. It was better than risking seeing her again. But I was stupid to think the bus was the problem. It was like she was waiting for me this time. I rounded a corner to an empty street and she was standing before me, presenting herself with the gun already in her mouth. And again I think you know the rest.\n\nThe police were interested and very suspicious about me. I mean I don’t blame them, 3 girls who look the same all killing themselves in front of me in the span of 3 months. But, that quickly died down as I had literally no connection with her besides looking similar. The girl herself had nothing about her, no name, no family, it was like she was never real to begin with.\n\n\n\nSo Reddit. How do I make this stop? I know it won’t be the last I see of her unless I do something about it. Any kinds of things I can do to dispel curses or evil spirits? Literally anything would help. I’m not crazy, but what else do you do in a situation like this? \n\n\n\nThank you for reading, please help."},"58":{"title":"My Roommate Watches The Door So I Can't Leave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kehy0q\/my_roommate_watches_the_door_so_i_cant_leave\/","flair":null,"author":"VentStalker","selftext":"I'm a university student and two days ago, I began renting a room in this apartment downtown. Sure, it's pretty far from the campus, but rent was remarkably cheap, so I thought that would even it out. It would've, if I didn't have this particular roommate who's name I dont actually know. I'll just call him John. \n\nJohn is quite skinny and very tall, he has pale white skin, and black soulless eyes. He spends most of his time in his room, and only ever leaves to go to the bathroom. Weirdly enough, we only first interacted this morning, when I tried to leave the apartment so I could go to the local supermarket. The moment I had opened the front door, I felt a cold hand grab me from behind. I was quite shocked, so I turned around and saw John standing there, a wide creepy smile etched on his face. And then he spoke, his tone threatening.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Uh, supermarket...\" I replied, taken aback by his question. \n\nSuddenly, he pulled me forwards by the shoulder, and I fell to the ground. He did it so effortlessly. Then, he loomed over me, and spoke again, before retreating to his room. \n\n\"There's food in the fridge. Don't attempt to leave.\" \n\nI lay on the floor for maybe half a minute, dazed and confused. Then I went back to my room, wondering what all that was about. At around 3pm, there was a knock on my door, and when I opened it, John was standing there, holding a piece of paper and a pen. He spoke, but this time his tone was softer than it was earlier.\n\n\"I'm going to the supermarket, what do you want me to buy?\"\n\nI was happy, thinking that this was his way of apology for his behaviour earlier, so I told him everything I wanted him to buy. However, as soon as he left, I realized that maybe he didn't want me to leave, and that was why he was going to the supermarket, not me. The realisation sent chills down my spine. \n\nI had to escape before John returned. So, I went to the balcony of the apartment, and I watched John enter a black van in the parking lot outside, then speed away. The moment I saw him speed away, I ran towards the front door and opened it. Then I started running down the corridor of the building. I was fast. Too fast.\n\nAs I turned the corner towards the stairwell, I bumped into an old man, and he fell to the ground. He had such a sweet face, and I instantly felt bad. It was entirely my fault, I should've not been running. I helped the man up as I apologised, and he smiled warmly at me. But I noticed he was limping, and I was worried for him, so I did the sensible thing and offered to help him to his apartment, as I assumed he lived in this building. He did. In fact, a few doors down from John's apartment. \n\nAs he unlocked the door and entered, he thanked me and welcomed me inside. I was inclined to decline, considering I wanted to be as far away from John's apartment as possible, but the man had such a sweet face, and I figured he could help me. So I went inside and sat down on his couch in the living room, whilst he prepared some tea for me. \n\nA couple minutes of awkward silence passed, until he brought me my tea, and sat down next to me. I didn't realize it at the time but now, looking back at it, I realized that he wasn't limping anymore. In fact, his leg looked perfectly normal. \n\n\"Again, I'm sorry about bumping into you, and thank you for the tea, it's very nice.\" \n\nThe man chuckled and said, \"No worries, we all make mistakes.\" \n\n\"It's a stupid mistake, I shouldn't have been running.\"\n\nSuddenly, the man's demeanour changed from warm to cold, as he spoke, \"I wasn't talking about that mistake. I was talking about your mistake of stepping foot into my apartment.\"\n\nThat was the last thing I remember, before I woke up in my room, in John's apartment. Now I'm writing all this, hoping someone will read it, and get me the help I need. Whatever you do though, don't rent a remarkably cheap room. It might just save your life.

For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke7die\/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my\/","flair":null,"author":"UnalloyedSaintTrina","selftext":"I’ve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nTowering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.\n\nI sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A\/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.\n\nThis was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.\n\nI couldn’t let myself completely relax, though.\n\nYes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.\n\nBecause it wasn’t just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn’t visible when I entered, but she was always there.\n\nIf I couldn’t see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn’t have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.\n\nSame pattern every time, measured and deliberate.\n\n*Tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap.*\n\nThe knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.\n\nAnd most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I’d never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.\n\nThe elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn’t ever sure how I knew that fact, but I’d bet my life on its truthfulness - twenty times over.\n\nSo, there I’d be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.\n\nEventually, though, I’d wake up.\n\nThe same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.\n\n*Tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap.*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***My Birth:***\n\nEver since I can remember, I’ve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I’m sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can’t confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.\n\nLet me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.\n\nAs soon as I drew a first breath, my mother’s heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.\n\nBut the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they’d resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.\n\nThe way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room. It was either me or her, and there was nothing they could do to change that: an unshakable declaration from God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such an edict. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren’t so deeply tragic.\n\nThree or four cycles later, my mother’s heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn’t have “the balls” to admit it. Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother’s veins instead of adrenaline or something.\n\nI doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.\n\nSee, that’s the rub. Although I’ve always felt like an outsider, that doesn’t mean I’ve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I’ve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I’m like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I’m still alone.\n\nWhich brings me to Anthony.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***My Childhood:***\n\nI experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn’t scare me much, though. I just couldn’t see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.\n\nThat was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn’t get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.\n\nAnd every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.\n\nOne afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty claw into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.\n\nThat was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony’s too, apparently.\n\nI spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin’s temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.\n\nIt was a real “one-two” punch.\n\nAn hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal’s office, both waiting to be interrogated.\n\nI’ve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.\n\nI tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.\n\nNow, there’s no one else.\n\nThis post is designed to fix that.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***The Gallery:***\n\n“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)\n\nIt wasn’t the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.\n\nOne foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie’s singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.\n\nOil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast’s knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.\n\nStudying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I’ve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie’s head.\n\nBecause they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.\n\nThey were holes - literally.\n\nEvery painting in the gallery had a pair of them.\n\nShe liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.\n\nWhen she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze through the holes.\n\nSometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.\n\nEventually, the frame would tremble with her message.\n\n*Tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap.*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***My Adolescence:***\n\n*“What’s the holdup, then? Just do it already,”* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.\n\nThe man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.\n\n*“Quinn! What the fuck are you doing?”* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.\n\nI sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.\n\nSmell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.\n\nI felt my confidence balloon further.\n\n*“I’ll do it, bitch…I’ll s-shoot. I ain’t afraid. I’ll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor…”* the would-be criminal stuttered.\n\nI stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.\n\n*“Yeah, I heard you the first time, man.”*\n\nI smiled, baring my teeth.\n\n*“So, do it then. Look. I’m making it easy for you. Don’t even have to aim.”*\n\nLike the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman’s bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.\n\nWithout saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.\n\nI flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn’t applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.\n\nBut I sure as shit pretended they were.\n\nI was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I’d ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn’t let it go.\n\nHe wore me down.\n\nSo, I told him that I didn’t experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.\n\nNo one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nMy first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.\n\nSynesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.\n\nBut that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:\n\n*The man tasted loud.*\n\n*The apple felt bright.*\n\n*The musical note sounded purple.*\n\nYou get the idea. It’s like nerves getting their wires crossed.\n\nFor a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.\n\nI eventually picked up on the pattern.\n\nOnce I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don’t like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.\n\nI could feel death’s advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.\n\nAt least, that’s what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may be shouting them at your computer screen already.\n\n1. Just because I could sense death didn’t mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.\n2. I didn’t know for certain that I could sense *everyone’s* death. There’s one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.\n\nHow could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***The Gallery:***\n\nThe night of my twelfth birthday, she revealed herself.\n\nShe finally came out.\n\nThere was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.\n\nThe woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.\n\nShe had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.\n\nHer movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.\n\nI couldn’t see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.\n\nThere was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.\n\nShe twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.\n\nThen, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I’ve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.\n\n*\"Are*\n\n*You Ready*\n\n*To See What Is*\n\n*Below?\"*\n\nI shook my head. She looked disappointed.\n\nThen, I woke up.\n\nThree hundred and sixty-five days later, she’d wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.\n\nYear, after year, after year.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***My Early Twenties***\n\nIn order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony’s falling out.\n\nThe summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.\n\nHis speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.\n\nNote the language. It wasn’t that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.\n\nI tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I’d harped on since he hit puberty.\n\nRomantic love wasn’t in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn’t a judgement.\n\nHe wouldn’t hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a “stuck-up bitch” through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father’s factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.\n\nI think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:\n\n*“Listen, Anthony, I don’t think I’m better than you. It’s not like that at all. We’re just different. Fundamentally different. I’m sorry, but that’s never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.”*\n\nIn retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don’t think he took the words as I intended.\n\nFrom there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house’s living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***Current Day***\n\nFast forward to last week.\n\nI returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I’d began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I’ve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I’ve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.\n\nAnd who do I just so happen to run in to?\n\nAnthony.\n\nHonestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.\n\nI couldn’t detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn’t because something purged it from his system.\n\nHe’d just gotten more proficient at hiding it.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nLast night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come “kick the shit out of him” if he heard I was out with an “old flame”.\n\nFor what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn’t interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.\n\nThat made him smile.\n\nInevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.\n\nI almost reminded him that it wasn’t *his* company. It was his father’s company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.\n\nIt might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.\n\nI wasn’t experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that’s what pepper spray is for.\n\nAnthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.\n\nI won’t lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.\n\nI do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.\n\nAt that point, I was already walking up the stairs.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nFor the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.\n\nEventually, though, enough was enough.\n\nI think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.\n\nI told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.\n\nWhen I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.\n\n*Fine,* I thought. *I don’t need his permission to leave.*\n\nHe didn’t say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.\n\nIt didn’t budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.\n\n*“…Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?”* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest\n\nNothing. No response. Not a peep.\n\nInstead, the lights clicked off.\n\nI felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.\n\nSweat poured over my temples.\n\nI perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.\n\nNo synesthesias.\n\nJust darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.\n\nI reached into my purse for my cellphone.\n\nThen - furious movement down the stairs.\n\nThe sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged me back up to the foyer.\n\nAnthony quickly pinned my body to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn’t much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.\n\nWithout uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.\n\nThe veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.\n\nConsciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.\n\nI closed my eyes.\n\nWith the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.\n\n“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”*\n\nI wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.\n\nUnexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.\n\nAnthony’s hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nA serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.\n\nA hand still tightly gripped the dagger’s handle, but Anthony’s heavy knees had never left my elbows.\n\nIt wasn’t mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.\n\nAnd it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.\n\nHis foyer became a bonfire.\n\nI stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.\n\nI raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.\n\nThe door remained mechanically locked.\n\nI screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.\n\nI shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.\n\nFour asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.\n\nI tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.\n\nIncorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*\n\nI tried Anthony’s birthday.\n\nNothing.\n\n*One attempt left.*\n\nMy panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.\n\nThen, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.\n\nYet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall, directly behind my head.\n\n*Tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*\n\n*Tap tap.*\n\nI held my breath.\n\n*1-3-4-2.*\n\nThe screen opened.\n\nI clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.\n\n\\- - - -\n\n***The Gallery:***\n\nWhen I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.\n\nThe woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.\n\nShe grinned at me from the floor.\n\nFor the first time, I asked *her* a question.\n\n*“Why could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?”*\n\nShe glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.\n\nHer voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.\n\n*“Because he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That’s what was written. You can’t foretell something that’s never been written.”*\n\nHer grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.\n\n*“But I intervened. You’d never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.”*\n\nThen it was her turn to ask me something.\n\n*“Are you ready to see what’s below?”*\n\nI nodded.\n\nImmediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo’d through the gallery.\n\nThe doors opened, and I gasped.\n\nThere was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a silver cocktail dress with the edges of a bloody hospital gown peeking out from underneath. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *“Happy Birthday!”* in a rainbow of colors.\n\nThe woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.\n\nI walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.\n\nI’d always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn’t. I was much, much older.\n\nAnd that revelation really got me thinking.\n\nMaybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it’s been more of a premonition.\n\nA vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.\n\nThe woman’s newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,\n\n*“If you wake up before we get there, that’s OK. You’re finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you’ll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my single-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*”\n\n*“My one and only daughter.”*\n\nThen, I [woke up.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalloyedsainttrina\/)"},"60":{"title":"Have You Heard About the Sisterhood of Death?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kebprt\/have_you_heard_about_the_sisterhood_of_death\/","flair":null,"author":"ParanoidLetters","selftext":"The first time I saw the waving lady was about five days ago.\n\nIt was broad daylight, and I was at a train station on my way to work. I was already inside the train, leaving the station, when I looked out the window and saw her.\n\nShe was wearing a black dress, black leather shoes, and a black medical face mask. Her long, dark, wavy hair framed her face. The moment our eyes met, she lifted her hand and waved.\n\nThere were plenty of people inside the train, so I didn’t think the wave was meant for me.\n\nBut when I looked around, no one else seemed to react.\n\nTwo days later, I was on my way back to my flat after buying some groceries. I saw the same lady in black standing across the street. When I turned my head toward her, she lifted her hand again and waved at me.\n\nShe wore a mask, and she didn’t look like anyone I knew, so I quickly assumed she was waving at someone behind me.\n\nCurious, I looked around.\n\nThere was no one.\n\nNot a single person.\n\nWeird, but I couldn’t say she was threatening me. She was just waving from a distance.\n\nThen, just this morning, I was at my office on the second floor. My desk is right beside a window overlooking the road below. If I look down, I can see the crossing.\n\nI saw the lady in black standing there. She was wearing the same black medical mask, but her head was tilted upward, staring directly at the window beside my desk.\n\nWhen our eyes met, she lifted her hand and waved.\n\nI asked my co-worker Kyle, who sat right beside me, if he saw the woman. His response sent chills down my spine.\n\n“What woman? The crossing is empty.”\n\nHe wasn’t joking. On separate occasions, I asked my other co-workers the same question. No one claimed to see her. All of them reacted as if I’d gone crazy, asking why I thought a woman was standing in an empty space.\n\nShocked, I pulled out my phone and stared at it.\n\nThe picture on my phone showed an empty crossing.\n\nI quickly turned my head back to the road below. I still saw her standing there, dressed in black from head to toe, even the mask.\n\nOnce again, she waved at me, toward the second floor of the building.\n\nThe waving lady didn’t appear in my phone’s picture. Kyle couldn’t see her either.\n\nAll day at work, she stayed at the crossing. Every time I turned to look at her and our eyes met, she waved.\n\nWhen I left the office building that evening, I didn’t see her. I took it as a good sign. But I was wrong.\n\nI hopped on the train as soon as it arrived. I was looking at my phone, scrolling through social media as I walked in and sat down. I didn’t look around.\n\nThe moment the train departed, I felt as though someone was staring at me, so I lifted my head.\n\nThe train car I was in was empty, except for me...\n\n...and the lady in black.\n\nThis time, she wasn’t alone.\n\nThere were two other women, wearing exactly the same black dress and black medical mask. They also had the same long, wavy, black hair.\n\nThe moment I looked at them, all three turned their heads toward me.\n\nSeconds later, all three of them lifted their hands and waved at me.\n\nFuck.\n\nI dropped my gaze to the floor, hoping nothing worse would happen.\n\nThen my phone buzzed.\n\nIt was Sophia, my other friend at work. She was known for her knowledge of all things spiritual and supernatural.\n\n“Kyle said you saw a woman wearing all black outside the building today? Someone he couldn’t see?” Sophia asked immediately.\n\n“Well, I’m on a train now, and I’m seeing them,” I replied.\n\n“Them?”\n\n“There are three of her now on the train.”\n\n“Are you still looking at them?”\n\n“No, I’m staring at the floor. They’re creepy.”\n\n“Try looking at them now,” Sophia said. “Are there still three?”\n\n“What the fuck,” I muttered. “What do you mean, still three?”\n\nInstinctively, I lifted my head to glance at the strange women in black.\n\nThey were still there.\n\nBut not three.\n\nThere were four of them. They were all staring at me, and then waving at me. At the same time.\n\nFuck.\n\n“They’re four now,” I whispered in horror. “What the fuck is happening?!”\n\n“Before I explain, Ryan, don’t look away from them,” Sophia warned.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“They increase in number every time you look away and then look back.”\n\nReflexively, I turned my head again to look at them.\n\nThere were five now. Waving at me.\n\n“Sophia, what the fuck is this?!”\n\n“Sisterhood of Death,” Sophia explained calmly. “They are called, intentionally or unintentionally, by the people you’ve murdered throughout your life.”\n\n“Whoa! I’ve never murdered anyone!”\n\n“This doesn’t always mean literally.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“If you ever treated someone terribly, or bullied someone to the point they killed themselves, it’s considered murder. When they cursed death upon you as they died, they called out to the Sisterhood of Death.”\n\nImmediately, I thought of my high school days—things I’m not proud of.\n\n“The revenge starts the day you turn 25,” Sophia continued. “And I know you just had your 25th birthday five days ago.”\n\n“W-what should I do then?” I stuttered, trembling.\n\n“At some point, they’ll start to multiply until they match the number of people you caused to die,” Sophia replied. “If it’s five, they’ll grow to five before they come to kill you. And it won’t be an easy death. They’ll make you die slowly... painfully.”\n\nI choked.\n\n“Sophia, you have to help me,” I begged.\n\n“How many people have you murdered in the past?” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know, Sophia! I didn’t do it with the intention to kill them!”\n\n“That’s the excuse of all bullies,” Sophia said coldly. “I’ve heard of this happening to more people than I can count. The worst case I knew was someone who had seven. I told them to find their victims’ families and ask for forgiveness. How many women in black are with you now?”\n\nI looked at them and tried to count.\n\nWhen I had my conversation with Sophia, I completely forgot to keep my eyes on them. Subconsciously, I shifted my gaze from the sisters to my phone or the floor, back and forth. I couldn’t remember how many times that had happened.\n\nI lost count of how many times the sisters had multiplied.\n\n“I don’t know, Sophia,” I said, shivering head to toe. “There are a lot. Twenty... maybe twenty-two...?”\n\nThere was silence on Sophia’s end for a few seconds before I heard her voice again.\n\n“You evil lunatic,” she said, her tone flat and expressionless.\n\nThen she hung up."},"61":{"title":"The Inhabitant Ritual (FINAL)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kem0qw\/the_inhabitant_ritual_final\/","flair":"Series","author":"hog_crankin","selftext":"[Part One](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbkvlz\/the_inhabitant_ritual\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part Two](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kcd4tc\/the_inhabitant_ritual_part_2\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n \n\n11:20.\n\nIt took Wade. I don’t know if he’s still alive, but it took him and it’s probably going to do something bad to him.\n\nOne more thing. That stupid son of a bitch left the goddamn paper with the phrase in his car. If we get out of this, I’m beating the shit out of him.\n\nGathering myself once more, I went to the stairs and headed back up to the first floor. It was pitch black in the house now, so I had only my flashlight to guide me.\n\nI couldn’t even begin to think of where it had taken Wade. I wasn’t exactly equipped with any good ideas, so the best I could come up with was going room to room and hopefully catching the mannequin off guard.\n\nI heard clattering in the kitchen.\n\nCould it have been in there? I only had one way to find out, so I snuck through the halls and eventually made my way to the entrance of the kitchen.\n\nIt had Wade on the counter.\n\nI wasn’t sure if it could see me, so I turned my flashlight off. I decided that sneaking up behind it and hitting it as hard as I could with the flashlight would be the best way to go about it.\n\nI snuck up on it and raised my flashlight.\n\nThen it *turned around*.\n\nIt wasn’t as though the mannequin had innate abilities to lock someone in place, but it almost felt as though it’s gaze froze me. I couldn’t move at all.\n\nLike a deer in headlights.\n\n“C—c’mon, move!” I yelled at my hand, straining nearly every muscle in my body just to move one finger.\n\nThe mannequin turned its head. Even though it didn’t have eyes, I could have sworn it looked at me, and then my hand.\n\nI snapped out of my paralysis and hit the head with a dizzying thunk. The mannequin’s head careened to the left before snapping back into place. I heard the sickening sound of wood and wires creaking as it raised its arms.\n\nIt *pushed* me.\n\nHad it not been for the refrigerator behind me, I might’ve gone way farther than I did. Still, I could tell this thing meant me harm. I crashed against the fridge and crumpled to the ground soon after.\n\nI felt winded. I could hear it walk over to me as I was struggling to catch my breath. I turned myself around and attempted to crawl out of the kitchen, but the mannequin grabbed my ankle.\n\nStrangely enough, it didn’t drag me or anything like that. Instead, it crushed my ankle. I screamed out in pain. My foot felt like it was on fire.\n\n I looked down to it and saw it had turned from my regular, healthy skin tone to an ugly, purple-brown shade. I wouldn’t be able to walk with it. I had to find a way to get out of this.\n\nBefore I could think of anything, it grabbed me. It held me in a way a fireman would and threw me out of the kitchen. I crashed through the basement door and went tumbling down the stairs.\n\nI tried to get up, but every part of my body ached. I was able to lift my head for a few seconds only to see it in the doorway of the basement. It looked down at me and slammed the door, trapping me in the basement.\n\nWade. I couldn’t save him. Those were the last thoughts I had before I blacked out.\n\n11:58.\n\nI jolted awake, pain still flowing through my body like a river. I was able to get up this time, though I struggled doing so. Unable to walk properly, I crawled up the stairs and was about to open the door when Wade appeared before me.\n\nI couldn’t believe it. He was alive.\n\n“Holy shit man. Wha—what happened? Did you manage to catch it with the phrase?”\n\nHe looked blankly at me before dryly replying.\n\n“Wha—wh—what phrase?”\n\nI chuckled. He always was a jokester.\n\n“Th—the phrase to cast the spirit away! You—you did do it, r—right?”\n\n“Phrase. Phrase. Phrase. Phrase.”\n\n“Wade, man, what’s going on?”\n\nI shined the light past him into the kitchen and nearly passed out from fear when I saw it.\n\n*The mannequin*.\n\nIt did get him. I didn’t know what else to do, so I heaved myself and tried to stand up.\n\n“Oh, I get it now.” I said, putting a hand on the spirit’s shoulder. “You want to finish the game, right, buddy?”\n\nI was going to make a move. A *stupid* move. It was going to be an incredibly stupid decision, but only if it didn’t work.\n\n“Let me squeeze past you and take a look at that thing, would ya?”\n\nAs soon as I was behind what was once Wade, I shoulder-tackled it. My plan ended up working. It fell down the stairs in an explosion of noise.\n\nAs the puppet finished its descent, I heard a sickening crunch. I limped down to the basement and decided I would turn the power on before investigating what happened to that, thing, I guess.\n\nWade, well, I guess Wade’s body was crumpled on the floor, his neck *broken*. I slumped to my knees and began to sob. Wade was my best friend and even though this was his idea, I felt guilty for the fact that it got him killed.\n\nI suppose there’s an 11^(th) rule.\n\n“If the spirit transfers to another vessel, and that vessel is destroyed, then Incola will be transported back to the spirit world.”\n\nI never needed to say the phrase.\n\n \n\nMy parents got home at 1:30 AM. They found me passed out in the basement with a bruised body and my friend’s dead one right near it. I wouldn’t say it was clear cut, but nobody blamed me for Wade’s death.\n\nI’m currently recovering from my injuries in the hospital. Broken foot, skull fracture and a broken collarbone. It hurts like hell but I’m glad I made it out alive.\n\nI have nightmares every night now. Not about the mannequin, I have them about Wade. He comes to me and berates me.\n\n“You should’ve done better.”\n\n“You could have saved me.”\n\n“You enabled me to do this.”\n\nOf course, I know it isn’t really him, but it still ends with me swearing and shivering every night. I’ve been seeing a therapist to put all of these feelings to rest. It’s working, and I’m slowly beginning to put my life back together.\n\n \n\nLooking back on it, I can only ask one thing. One thing for my own sake and the sake of everybody else in the world.\n\n \n\nHow many other people have tried to do what I did?

I ordered some pizza, then watched TV. I feel asleep a bit, but woke to three loud knocks on my front door.\n\n\n\nI went to see who it was, and, when opening the door, I saw two kids staying there, a girl and a boy, who told me they needed a place to stay, as their parents kicked them out. I invited them in, I offered them food, but they declined. I tried to give them soda, but they refused.\n\n\n\nThey were too shocked, too scared to accept.\n\nI talked to them, I tried comforting them. They listened to me, they were crying. Suddenly, the TV switched on a different channel all by itself. I found this weird, but decided to focus on the kids. The girl told me she loved to sing, so I led her to my piano.\n\nShe began playing an eerie song. I was shocked, but was unable to move.\n\n\n\nI saw shadows crawling on the walls, shadows drawn like moths to her song. And the song kept going on, creepy as hell, and the shadows moved.\n\nSuddenly, a bang: One of the windows just blew up to pieces. The girl stopped playing her song and began crying.\n\n\n\nThe boy too looked scared. I went to the window, and felt a cold wind blowing in my face with such a force, it almost swept me off my feet. The two kids took a seat on my couch. I wanted to call 911, as this situation didn't seem right. But I couldn't as my cell phone's battery was 1%. I swore I charged it this very morning and didn't use it. I went looking for the charger, but couldn't find it.\n\nAnd the night went on. On TV it was a documentary featuring a gruesome murder. The boy suddenly...laughed.\n\n\n\nWhat the hell? I tried taking the remote from his hand, but suddenly, I saw he had claws instead of fingers, but only for a second, then the fingers and the hands were normal looking.\n\nI didn't know what to do at this point. I couldn't call anyone. Another bang. The fridge's door was wide open. Then, I saw the kids walking towards me. They said they needed a hug and that they were very scared. They began...cornering me, and kept asking me for a hug. I ran, but the laptop smashed right in front of me, making me trip.\n\n\n\nThe kids approached me, their eyes now fully black, as they kept repeating their request. I ran towards the door. The kids were after me. They glided across, as floating, as hovering a bit above ground. I ran to a neighbor's house and frantically knocked on his door.\n\nThe neighbor saw the kids coming and repeating the same words. He grabbed his gun and pointed it at the kids.\n\n\n\nThey both faded into the night. The neighbor told me these kids were evil. They also visited his son and he hugged them. But then, the kids accused him of assault and inappropriate behavior and he was into a lot of trouble. I got away easy."},"63":{"title":"We're building an army of monsters to fight something worse.

Walls dissolved into syrupy shadow and brick by brick, another place assembled around me. Older. Wetter.\n\nMy heart seized.\n\nThe basement.\n\nI was back in the basement.\n\nThis moment, I remembered it. It was my birthday. I only knew because Carol had promised me a present. A little surprise. Something handmade. But then the Ma’am said she needed her help with the Red Queen’s story.\n\nWhen I asked if Carol could still give me the present, the Ma’am smiled—tight and teeth-bared.\n\n“I suppose not,” she said. “Considering you’ll be in bed by the time we’re finished. And by then it won’t be your birthday anymore, now will it?”\n\nI cursed. Or rather, I heard myself curse inside the memory.\n\nThe Wither Tree answered.\n\nIt grew up out of the dirt of the basement floor, up through the entire house. It groaned in the dark, low and guttural like a dying god. It always made noises—shifting branches and creaking bark, but sometimes... sometimes it spoke.\n\nSometimes it said my name.\n\nI stepped forward, lantern in hand. The flame stuttered in the damp. This was my least favorite household duty: braving the dark. Fetching practically ancient cans from the sagging shelves, while shadows curled across the walls like watching things.\n\n*Beans. Soup. Peas.*\n\nI mouthed the list like a prayer.\n\nThe tree pounded, throbbed like a heartbeat.\n\nGroaned.\n\n“Boy…”\n\nA breathless voice. Rough as coals.\n\n“Such a sweet child… won’t you come closer?”\n\nI froze. The lantern trembled. Shadows breathed.\n\n*Beans. Soup. Peas.*\n\nNot this shelf. Not that one.\n\n“Just a taste,” it crooned. “Just the heart…”\n\nI bolted.\n\nCans clattered from my arms and spilled across the floor, rolling like teeth as I flung the door shut behind me. My breath came in panicked bursts.\n\nAnd there she was.\n\nThe Ma’am.\n\nShe stood waiting in the hall, silhouetted against the light of her study. Her hand cracked across my face.\n\n**Smack.**\n\n“Don’t slam doors.”\n\nI winced. “...I’m sorry.”\n\n**Smack.**\n\n“You are not sorry.”\n\n**Smack.**\n\n“You are malicious and unruly.”\n\nI clutched my cheek, eyes stinging, lip trembling.\n\n“It was the tree,” I stammered. “There’s something inside it. A monster. It said it wanted my heart—”\n\n“The only monster in this house is you.”\n\nShe stepped closer. Her breath smelled like copper and ink.\n\n“And you haven’t got a heart to give.”\n\nShe glanced down at the spilled cans. Beans. Soup. Peas. Rolling in circles.\n\n“Clean those up.”\n\nThen she turned and vanished into her study. The door clicked shut. The lock slid home.\n\nI busied myself with picking up the cans, dreaming of the day all of this would end. The day the Ma'am could be a mother to me. The day we could all be happy, like the families Gran told me about. \n\nThe Red Queen. \n\nThat's who we were waiting for. We couldn’t leave until she showed up, otherwise the Hungry Things would get us. \n\nBut the Red Queen would save us. \n\n**Clack-clack-clack. Ding.**\n\nI paused. Her typewriter.\n\nAnd underneath it, faint: \n\nCarol. Rasping.\n\nShe sounded exhausted. Weak.\n\n“…It’s his birthday…”\n\n“Quiet,” the Ma’am snapped. “I’m nearly finished the draft. Your squirming is making the ink run.”\n\n“He deserves a happy birthday…”\n\n“He deserves what I say he deserves.”\n\nA cough. Wet. Weak. “He’s kind, you know. He isn’t like your other monsters…”\n\nNot like her other monsters? My breath caught. Is that what I was—another monster?\n\nSilence.\n\nThen the floor creaked.\n\nFootsteps. Slow. Deliberate. And the Ma’am’s voice again—soft now, almost sweet. But sweet like spoiled fruit.\n\n“Would you like to know a secret, Mother?”\n\nI pressed my ear to the door, heart racing. \n\n“He was never meant to be my monster. You were.”\n\nA pause. A shiver in my spine.\n\n“The Boy is just collateral. A little leverage. Because if you don’t behave his story won’t have a happy ending. And I know you can’t stomach the thought of that. Not after what happened to your dear Gretchin.”\n\nMy stomach twisted. Tears burned hot in my eyes. Grethicn. My older sister, the one that Ma’am had exiled to die in the Thousand Acre Wood. \n\nI always knew I’d been born from the Ma’am’s imagination. But I always thought I was here to help her save the world. From the Disorder. And the Boogeyman.\n\nBut it turns out I was just a living ransom note—a child raised to bleed the one person the Ma’am couldn’t break. \n\nGran was never meant to love me. \n\nShe was meant to suffer me.\n\nThe memory flickered, straining under the weight of my emotions. The peeling wallpaper gave way to the flicker of emergency lighting in Chamber 13, then shifted back again. I heard myself, not in the memory, but in the present. Groaning. Mumbling in delirium. Fighting back against the Hatter’s magic.\n\nI'd nearly pulled myself out when I stepped back in the memory.\n\nThe floorboard creaked.\n\nInside, the Ma’am’s footsteps retreating to her desk stopped dead. My heart stopped with them.\n\nNo. No no no—\n\nThe door flung open. She stood in the frame, eyes wild, words sharper than a knife. “Eavesdropping are we?”\n\nShe lunged. Fingers twisted in my hair. I yelped as she dragged me down the hall, boots clapping hard behind us.\n\n“Selfish. Ingrate. *Rotten*.”\n\n“Carol!” I sobbed. \n\nGran's voice rasped behind us. “Don’t…” she groaned. “Please don’t hurt Levi…”\n\nI think she tried to follow, but there was a thud. The sound of her frail body hitting the floor.\n\nI twisted in the Ma’am’s grip. “Lemme go! Carol—!”\n\nThe Ma’am shoved me forward. Toward the only door in the house not boarded up with timber and nails. This one had locks instead. A dozen of them, steel and brass and rusted iron. She set to work on them, her movements frantic, furious.\n\nI tried to back away. Her hand yanked me close.\n\nHer eyes blazed—not just with anger, but with something worse.\n\nHate.\n\n“There’ll be no more disobedience from you,” she seethed. “I’ve given you chance after chance. Each time, you disappoint. Each time, you prove what an ungrateful little brat you are. Just like your sister.”\n\nHer fingers dug into my shoulder like talons.\n\n“So now you’ll get exactly what you want—a life without a family.”\n\nClick. Clack. Snap. The locks tumbled open, one after another.\n\n“You can live it out in the woods, alongside all the corpses you call your siblings.”\n\n“Please, Mama, I didn’t mean to—”\n\nShe raised her hand.\n\nI flinched.\n\nBut the blow didn’t come.\n\n“Do *not* call me that,” she hissed. Her voice had dropped. Cold now. Measured. “You haven’t earned the privilege of calling me mother.”\n\nShe crouched, face inches from mine. “Now stay where you are. Move an inch, and I’ll send you to get chopped up by the Woodsman instead. Would you like that?”\n\nI shook my head so fast it made my neck ache.\n\nThe Ma’am gave the final lock a savage twist and flung the door open.\n\nLight.\n\nBlinding light.\n\nI staggered, shielding my eyes. Wind whipped past my cheeks. Real wind. For a moment, the sunlight caught me fully and I forgot everything—forgot the grief, forgot the yelling.\n\nAnd it was beautiful.\n\nBut then I saw ahead the gnarled stretch of haunted wood. The twisting boughs. The shifting branches. It felt like a hundred eyes watched me, hungry and waiting beyond the dark of the leaves. \n\nAnd that’s when it truly hit me—I wasn’t walking into freedom. \n\nI was walking to my grave. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI opened my eyes with a groan.\n\nThe wind was gone. So was the Thousand Acre Wood.\n\nIt was just cold steel and blinking red emergency lights. The stench of blood and fear. I blinked blearily, my head pounding as I took in the circular stone walls of Chamber 13. \n\nMy prison looked the same as ever. Same pretentious typewriter. Same scuffed chairs. Same cracked ceiling opening to—\n\nOkay. \n\nThat was new.\n\nThe floating shards of mirror-glass were gone. Now there hung a full moon, round and pale, squinting down at me with a yawning face. “Oh, you’re awake. If you’re looking for your friend, I’m afraid he’s gone and left.”\n\nThe moon was telling the truth.\n\nThe room was empty. There wasn’t any sign of Mister Neither anywhere—and not only that, but the door was *open*. Cracked ajar. It was like Mister Neither had gone out for a smoke and forgotten to lock it behind him.\n\nI rose on shaking legs, hardly believing my luck. Freedom. \n\nActual freedom.\n\nThen my heart pounded—ears prickling for any sound of an ambush. \n\nThis felt like a trap. It had to be one. Why would he just let me walk free? He’d just murdered Edwards to keep me for himself, hadn’t he? \n\nUnless...\n\nMaybe it wasn’t the Hatter showing me mercy. Maybe it was the Hare.\n\nHad Jekyll finally overpowered Hyde? It seemed unlikely, but I didn’t have time to run a full analysis on the situation. Trap or not, I had to try the door. It was my one shot at surviving this. \n\n“Did my—err—friend, say where he was going?” I asked the moon, hoping to at least get some bearings on the situation.  The moon gave a wide yawn. Smacked it lips. “Fraid’ not. Only mentioned he had ‘other’ business to attend to.” Another yawn. “Then he told me to watch over you… or else.”\n\nIt snorted. “As if I’d let a rabbit boss me around.”I blinked. “Right. Well, I’ll uh… see you around, I guess.”\n\n“Ta.”\n\nI hurried for the doorway—then stopped.\n\nEdwards’ playing card was still there, pinned to the wall by his knife. I pulled it free with a grunt, hoping—praying—it might shed some light on my situation. \n\nNo such luck.\n\nThe card was blank.\n\nNo scribbled escape route. Not even a handful of tips for defeating bloodthirsty rabbits.\n\nNothing. Just plain white card stock, like the machine forgot to add a suit or rank. I needed a trump card, and all I got was a misprint.\n\nTypical. \n\nStill, I pocketed it. If nothing else, it was something to remember Edwards by. The man sacrificed his life to buy me a little more time, and if I somehow got out of this, I’d make a fucking shrine for this stupid card.\n\nI took a deep breath. Cracked the door. Stepped out into the corridor.\n\nAnd it wasn't what I remembered. \n\nThe hallway was different. Gone were the scarlet bricks that spiraled into infinity. They'd been replaced with a sprawling expanse of white nothingness. Sterile. Blinding. Like a freshly-scrubbed hospital room. \n\nSo it wasn’t just the layout of the Sub-Vaults that changed during Realignments. It was the aesthetic. Like someone was plucking pieces from different realities and pasting them together down here hour by hour.\n\nWhich begged the question—how long had it been since the last Realignment? I didn’t know, but the last thing I needed was to get caught out here when the next storm tore through. \n\nBetter hurry. \n\nI jogged through endless, liminal corridors like a man looking for a grocery aisle that didn’t exist. Left. Right. Up. Down. Soon I couldn’t even tell which direction was forward anymore. \n\nRows of cells lined the walls—thick glass and black bars. Some empty. Others... not.\n\nCreatures twitched behind the glass. Whispered in dead languages. One sat hunched in the shadows, rocking back and forth, eyes like raw pearls. Another pressed its face to the bars and hissed my name.\n\nOne reached through the bars as I passed, long fingers brushing my sleeve. It coaxed me toward it. Told me I looked lost, that it could help. The wild thing is it looked human—maybe *too* human. Perfect teeth. Crystal smile. But one look at the label beside its cell told me everything I needed to know.\n\n**CONSCRIPT: 452 - PLAYTIME PETE**\n\n**THREAT CLASS: 5 - MASSACRE**\n\n**STRATEGY ID:  213 - 'FREE CANDY'**\n\nIt gripped the bars, smiling after me like a maniac.\n\nStill—Playtime Pete was right about one thing. I *was* lost. And I did need help. Every minute that ticked by dragged me closer to the next Realignment, and one step closer to making Edwards' sacrifice meaningless.\n\nI had to find somebody. Anybody, really. \n\nAn Inquisitor. \n\nA Warden. \n\nHell, at this point I’d even settle for Julia, the office gossip—and she screwed me out of my last promotion.  \n\nJust not an Overseer. The Jack of Clubs’ warning still echoed in my mind: *They want to dissect you.* \n\nI'd already had my fill of being a monster's science experiment. If the Overseers wanted to gut me, then they could take a number and get in line. \n\nThe floor shook. Just a little. Barely noticeable, but familiar enough to stop my heart. \n\nThe Sub-Vaults were starting to stir. Just like they had when Edwards was torn away. Already I could see Conscripts shifting uneasily beyond the bars of their cages. Some watching me with morbid anticipation, others howling like wolves before a storm. \n\nFaster, Reyes.\n\nThis couldn’t be how it ended.\n\nI pushed harder, heart hammering, but a pair shadows stretched ahead of me—and with them, the tinker of metal footsteps across tile. Two figures emerged from the far end of the hall.\n\nPorcelain masks.\n\nVanta black armor.\n\nHeart-shaped shields stained with ancient blood.\n\nThe Overseers met my gaze.\n\nShit. \n\n\"Halt, interloper.\"\n\nI froze, instinct slamming the brakes before my brain even caught up. The playing cards pinned to their chests said it all: the 3 and 9 of Hearts. Unlike the other suits, the Hearts weren’t just damaged—they were broken beyond repair. They’d been healers once, guardians for the traumatized, those clawing their way back from contact with urban legends and other Negative Narratives.\n\nThen Alice disappeared. And whatever compassion the Hearts had been built for... shattered. The Order tried to put them back together—but like Humpty Dumpty, it didn’t work out so well.\n\nNow the Hearts had one job: interrogative torture.\n\nAnd they were very, very good at it.\n\nI staggered backward, my mind scrambling for options. An arm shot through the bars behind me and yanked me tight against the cage.\n\n\"You should’ve taken my offer to help,\" whispered a bizarrely cheerful voice against my ear.\n\nI twisted in the Conscript’s grasp—and froze. \n\nFuck.\n\nPlaytime Pete.\n\nHow many times was someone going to abduct me today?\n\n\"Get off,\" I snarled, struggling against his grip, but it was useless. A Threat Class 5 entity could tear apart a SWAT team without breaking a sweat, and here I was, squirming like a toddler.\n\nMeanwhile, the Overseers closed the distance, porcelain masks gleaming beneath the sterile white lights. Their painted faces wept crimson tears. They weren’t as massive as the Jack of Clubs—not by half—but what they lacked in size, they made up for in creative cruelty. The Hearts didn’t kill you quickly. They took you apart like a clock, savoring every broken tick.\n\n\"This is he,\" hummed the 3 in a broken melody. \"The Analyst. The one the False Dealers seek. We are decreed to retrieve him at all costs, Brother.\"\n\nThe 9 nodded, pale cloak rippling off his jagged pauldrons. \"We will honor the Inquisition’s request. Excise the spare.\"\n\nThe 3 lifted her arm, blood-red shield catching the light. Her gaze shifted past me, locking onto Playtime Pete. The Conscript stiffened—then, without warning, released me. I stumbled free, hands splayed, heart hammering.\n\n\"Hold on,\" he blurted, that uncanny smile still stitched across his lips. \"Pete was just trying to help. Y-You told the little rat to halt. Pete halted him!\" The 3 cocked her arm back, shield clutched tight in her black gauntlet.\n\nPlaytime Pete yelped, scrambling back from the bars. He cowered against the back wall, fire-red hair, childish blue coveralls. If it weren't for the fact his eyes kept sliding down his face, and his smile never broke, you'd never guess he was a monster.\n\n\"I let him go!\" Pete shrieked. \"I did as you told me, ya daft bitch!\"\n\n\"For the Mother,\" intoned the 9, his voice low and final.\n\nThe 3 hurled her shield. It whirled through the air with a shriek of rending metal, the heart-shaped blade curving perfectly between the bars—and burying itself in Playtime Pete’s chest. He looked down in slow, stupid disbelief as the shield split him nearly in half, intestines spilling out in looping ropes onto the cell floor. His legs kicked once, twice. Then fell still.\n\nThe 3’s humming rose into a thin, warbling whistle. With a wet *thunk*, the shield tore free and snapped back into her hand. She fastened it to her back with a soldier’s precision, then turned her painted mask toward me.\n\n\"Rejoice, Analyst Reyes,\" she said sweetly. \"You have been granted salvation this day.\"\n\nThe Hearts clinked forward in perfect step, their black armor stark against the glaring white of the hallway. I hesitated. Maybe—just maybe—they were actually here to help. The Spades had wanted me dead, sure, but maybe that was *personal*. Maybe the Hearts were different.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I gasped. \"I really *really* need to get out of here. There’s an evil rabbit after me and—\"\n\nThe 9’s porcelain mask shifted mid-step, the painted sorrow hardening into something colder. Calculating. The 3’s humming faltered, dipping into a low, almost mourning key.\n\n\"He is the one,\" the 9 said slowly— \"—the Spades warned of,\" finished the 3.\n\nOh no.\n\n\"The variant,\" murmured the 9. \"The wild card.\"\n\nThe 3’s voice lifted, almost reverent. \"If he’s shuffled into the Deck—\"\n\n\"—the False Dealers lose control,\" finished the 9. “It will bring chaos to the Deck.”\n\nWild card. False Dealers. Chaos. \n\nI had no idea what they were talking about, but I got the sense it wasn’t friendly. \n\nMy feet moved before I could think. A slow, instinctive shuffle backward.\n\nNo Jack to protect me this time. \n\nThe 3 tilted her head up at the 9, the painted grief on her porcelain mask warping into something grotesque—like a child begging for a toy. \"May I open him, Brother?\" she whispered. \"Before the Shuffle? His eyes sing wrong songs, and I should like to hear if his heart sings the same.\"\n\n\"For the Mother?”“For the Mother.”The 9 reached for his shield. \"Then proceed.\"\n\nThe 3 turned back to me, and the mask melted into a grotesque caricature of glee.\n\nI bolted.\n\nTheir footsteps slammed against the floor behind me, a thunderous rhythm underscored by the tangled, manic humming of the 3 and 9. An asylum choir chasing me down. Hearts were sadists, sure—but they weren’t built for speed. In their iron suits, they were only slightly faster than me.\n\nSlightly.\n\nBut unfortunately, that still meant I was about ten seconds away from being pinned to the wall like Playtime Pete’s sadder sequel.\n\nA hiss cut the air behind me. I ducked just in time as a razor-edged shield screamed past my head, shearing a chunk from the wall. \n\nLeft. Hard left. Down a side corridor, sprinting blind—\n\nAnd there, just ahead: a figure about to step through a doorway.\n\nBlack suit.\n\nSilver pocketwatch.\n\nInquisitor.\n\n\"Wait!\" I shouted, sprinting full-tilt toward her. \n\nThe woman jerked back, blinking fast as she caught sight of me. Recognition hit first—then disbelief. \"Analyst Reyes? Holy shit. We’ve had teams tearing the Sub-Vaults apart looking for you! Where the hell have you—\"\n\nA shield screamed past my ear, embedding itself in the wall inches from her face. She flinched hard, color draining from her cheeks as the Overseers thundered around the corner.\n\n\"They’re trying to fucking dissect me!\" I gasped, reaching out to her. \"Stop them!\"Authority straightened her spine. \"Analyst Reyes is not to be—\"\n\nThe shield wrenched itself free from the wall with a disembodied shriek and slashed across her cheek. She staggered, hand flying to her face, eyes wide with disbelief.\n\n\"You have blasphemed, Sister,\" hummed the 9—right behind me. \n\n\"I disagree, Brother.” Steel fingers clamped around my collar, yanked me off my feet. I dangled helplessly in the grip of the 3 of Hearts. “Our blasphemy was ever bowing to the False Dealers.”\n\nSo the Inquisition was the False Dealers. \n\n\"For the Mother,\" the 9 intoned.“For the Mother.”\n\nAnd I could guess the Mother was Alice. \n\nInquisitor Tallis looked shellshocked as she scrambled for her pocketwatch. Flipped it open. Twisted the dial at the top, then brought it to her lips. “Owens,” she said, speaking into it. “This is Inquisitor Tallus. I’ve located Reyes but he’s about to be—”\n\nAlarms blared. Long. Aching. \n\nFamiliar. The PA system crackled to life, that same pre-recorded message rolling out.\n\n**\"STANDBY FOR REALITY REALIGNMENT.\"**\n\nThe ground shook. \n\nThe walls began to pulse, like they were falling inward then backward. Inquisitor Tallus cursed, shouting—begging—for the Overseers to release me, but they ignored her commands. I’d never seen an Overseer disobey an Inquisitor before.\n\nIt was almost like the Deck was beginning to rebel. \n\nWas the Order losing control of its Overseers? Is this what the Hearts meant by bringing chaos to the Deck—were they trying to usurp the False Dealers?\n\n**“PLEASE ENSURE ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE CLOSED.”**\n\nThe air thundered, slow and sickening. I thrashed. \"Let me go! You’re gonna get us all killed out there!\"\n\nThe 3 only smiled, her porcelain face crinkling into something almost maternal. \"Our souls belong to Mother. Death cannot claim them.\"\n\nThe 9 placed a heavy hand on my shoulder. \"We will be shuffled into the deck. Together. And—\"\"—redrawn anew,\" finished the 3, tightening her arms until I could barely breathe.\n\nThe wind whipped at my collar, screaming through the crumbling hallway. The tiled floor rippled and heaved, like the world itself was being shaken apart from waking up far beneath.\n\nAcross the widening breach, Inquisitor Tallis still stood in the doorway. Her hair lashed her face. Her eyes locked onto mine—haunted. Regretful. Her lips shaped a familiar phrase.*I’m sorry.*\n\nI nodded, numb. There was nothing she could do.\n\nNo one could stop what was coming.\n\nThe Order wasn’t just losing control. It was crumbling. Dying. \n\nMister Neither was loose.The Hearts had rebelled. And all around us, thousands of caged nightmares were waiting for their chance to break free and deliver a bloodbath on their captors. \n\nTallis gave me one last salute—a final, broken acknowledgment—then slammed the door shut, leaving me alone with the 3 and 9 of Hearts. Helpless.\n\nThe 3 lifted me like a sacrificial offering, arms locked beneath my shoulders. She cried out, voice cracking with joy. \"Hold fast, Brothers! The shuffling comes!\"\n\nI turned my head into the gale and saw it—a monstrous wall of debris, roaring down the corridor like the apocalypse given life. It wasn't just a storm. It was erasure, a tsunami made from the ruins of countless broken realities—from wonder itself. \n\nTerror bricked my limbs. \n\nThe 9 staggered forward to meet the end, arms spread wide against the storm, cloak snapping like torn wings. \"To shatter the Deck!\" he bellowed. \"We offer our Brother, the Joker!”\n\nThe word hit me like a stray round. \n\nThe Joker. \n\nThe missing card the Hare had hunted for, the second of the pair, had it been me all along? \n\nMy mind flailed for proof, for any scrap of—\n\nI dug into my pocket. Edwards blank card. It blazed to life in my fist. Ultraviolet ink surged across the stock, outlining a grinning court jester, and my jaw dropped.\n\nIt was true. \n\nAll this time—\n\n*I* was the second. \n\n**DING!**\n\nNot an alarm. A typewriter bell. The entire hallway lurched right, as if someone yanked the carriage of reality sideways.\n\nThe 3 hoisted me higher.  “Mother, we offer chaos for—”\n\nThe storm hit. \n\nWind sheared porcelain from her mask, disintegrating it into dust.\n\nMy ribs imploded inward, shattering my thoughts as my breath folded into a paper-thin whimper. My body sloughed apart like a sentence being unwritten.\n\nThe storm unmade me, atom by shrieking atom, until all that was left was the ache, and the empty page I'd been written upon.\n\nThe broken boy.\n\nThe failed draft.\n\nThe storm never killed me. It did something worse.\n\nIt peeled back my armor—my decades of repression, the jokes I cracked to stay sane, the lies I told myself just to keep breathing. It dug up every guilt I’d buried under cleverness and control, and showed me the truth: I’d never stopped being that scared little boy in the basement. I’d just gotten better at shutting him up.\n\nWhen it was done, the storm left me one final gift: the chance to witness what my survival cost.\n\nBecause of me, the Hearts succeeded in collapsing the Deck. I knew that meant Overseer rebellion. Which also meant unguarded Vaults. Which also meant that soon enough, thousands of caged nightmares would be set loose upon on the world—hungry, violent, and free.\n\nAnd all I could think was that Owens had been right. She'd told Edwards over the PA that either the Order ended tonight, or I did.\n\nUnfortunately for her, [I survived](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfo5b6\/were_building_an_army_of_monsters_to_fight\/).\n\n[XXX](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCryptid\/comments\/jba8ww\/story_master_list\/)"},"64":{"title":"My high school sweetheart died years ago.

I wanted to share my story, my experience*, *in case things get awry.*\n\n*\\**\n\n*Entry 2*\n\n*October 3, 2024*\n\nI had another nightmare that night—which knocked me straight out of sleep. Waking up in cold sweat with tears running down my face had become a new routine for me ever since moving back here. \n\nIt was the same nightmare every night,. Of that day. It was a month before our high school graduation. It kept repeating like a broken loop. The sun shone brightly, like it was mocking us as we searched for her tirelessly in those woods. \n\nNature dared to be beautiful on the day we put her to rest. Everything wasn’t fair. I lost the love of my life, and her parents would have to live on without their daughter.\n\nAbout Lauren’s parents, they are still around. I talk with them occasionally, they were thrilled when we ran into each other in town and invited me and Penny over for dinner. \n\nSeventeen years since the last time we saw each other. Yet, they regarded me with as much warmth as if I had never left.\n\nI reckoned that the years have not been kind to them since Lauren died.\n\nIt got me wondering if I should really have a talk with them about my ‘guest.’ But I’m not sure how’d they react, or if they’d even believe me.\n\nSpeaking of my guest. I tensed as my eyes scanned the surroundings of my bedroom. Usually, she’d be standing in the corner, her pupils shining an eerie red in the darkness, like a predator ready to pounce. But she would do nothing but stare.\n\nNo, she was nowhere to be found. I let go of a breath I didn’t know I was holding. The distant hum of the television and a set of voices downstairs caught my attention. My eyes furrowed at the time; 4:01 AM—too early for a Saturday.\n\nPutting on my slippers, I made my way downstairs to the living room, thinking it was Penny watching cartoons. No, instead I found ‘Lauren,’ sitting on the couch, remote resting idly in her hand—if you can call it that anymore.\n\n“Hey, Elliot!\" She chirped. \"Can you *believe* this? 17 years later and he *still* ain’t the pirate king yet! Total joke, right?” The skin on her chin wiggled as she laughed; it sounded like she was gurgling on blood. She gestured to the TV playing an episode of One Piece.\n\nHer skin was parchment-thin and stretched tight over bone, with long tears where the flesh had split open like old leather, revealing bone and sinew that looked like old dusty threads. Soft cracks would pop from her body—bones grinding against each other, I believe they were still not used to their new state. Veins, blackened and dry, snaked across her deathly pale forearm like dead ivy. Her knuckles were swollen and discolored, joints stiff and corpse-gray. \n\nI feared what would happen if I didn’t respond. “Y-Yeah, it’s pretty wild,” that was the truth. \n\nI haven’t watched One Piece in a long time. I lost interest halfway through college. Yet, I still couldn’t believe that it was still going on for *that* long. “What episode are you on?”\n\n“The one with the amazons! You know, when they all get blasted across the sky like pinballs for days? It’s hilarious,” she replied.\n\nI hummed in response. She patted the space next to her on the couch.  Reluctantly, I took a seat.\n\nMy eyes would occasionally flick towards her. Even then, I still couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Sometimes I believed that I was stuck in a dream, that I probably got into an accident and I've been stuck in a coma ever since.\n\n“Hey, uh…Lauren?”\n\nShe turned towards me. I avoided looking into her eyes.\n\n“Yes, babe?”\n\nI flinched.\n\nI *hated* it when she called me that. Not because of the word, but because hearing it come from her now, like some grotesque echo of the past—it made my skin crawl.\n\n“Well,” I struggled to find my voice. I wasn’t sure how she’d react to my question. “How are you back?”\n\nI needed to know, to understand how this was possible. If she really is the Lauren I once loved.\n\nShe stayed silent for what felt like hours. Her eyes unblinking, not an ounce of expression on her face. I tensed—the hairs on the back of my neck slowly stood as I braced. My breath was locked in my throat, as if something held it in a vice.\n\n“I have no freaking clue!” she announced animatedly. I thought I was gonna collapse due to the immense tension that built up for nothing.\n\n“What do you mean?” I questioned further.\n\n“Well, I don’t remember much. All I know is that I was in a different place before all this.”\n\nI quirked an eyebrow, intrigued. What did she mean by that?\n\n“Go on,” I said.\n\n“I was dead, Elliot. Pretty sure I still am,” she gestured to the state of her body. Inhuman, rotted, monstrous. “Memory’s a bit faded since I woke up, but I was somewhere else. I'm having trouble remembering where I was, but it was really warm and cozy. Like, I can’t tell if I’m supposed to be here or not.” \n\nHer fingers twitched absently—**inside** her skull. I physically recoiled in horror as she casually pushed two rotting fingers through a gap in her scalp, digging into the soft, decayed tissue as if rifling through an old attic box.\n\n“Then months ago, it felt like I woke up after a really long sleep. I was inside that coffin—didn’t really take me long to get out though,” she chuckled. “After that, I felt really hungry. Luckily, I found a deer nearby, and it was great. You’d be surprised how hard it is to get a bite in when your jaw keeps popping out, I wasn’t used to it back then.”\n\nShe giggled, the sound wet and crackling. \n\n“Doesn’t that hurt?”\n\n“Hm?” She looked at me, confused. I pointed at the action she was doing—her hand still embedded in her head.\n\n“Oh, this? No, not really. Nothing hurts anymore. I’m pretty sure all my nerves are rotten, I can’t really feel or taste anything—well, except blood.”\n\n“B-Blood?” It came out more as a whimper than a question.\n\n“Yeah, blood. For some reason, it’s the only thing I can taste.”\n\nIf she wasn’t a ghost, what the hell was she then?\n\nA vampire?\n\nI flinched as she ripped her hand from her head, sending pieces of flesh and blood in a gory fashion splattering on the floor.\n\n“Ha! You should see the look on your face!” She threw her head back as she howled with laughter.  “ Don’t worry, it disappears after a minute or two.\" I wasn’t sure if she was referring to the debris of brain matter on my floor or the gaping hole in her own head."},"65":{"title":"I Saw God.

I was driving back from a friend's house; admittedly, it was far too late, and I was far drunker than I should've been. But with the ride home at just under 20 minutes and the expectation of an open road at 3 AM, I figured it was worth the gamble.\n\nI wish I could give some dramatic lead-up to the crash. Honestly, though, even if I remembered what happened, it would take away from the stark reality that life is oddly anti-climactic in that way.\n\nOne second, you're going about your day. The next? Darkness. No dazzling near-death montage. No slow-motion farewell. Sometimes, things are *just* over.\n\nThe cops and paramedics later explained that a big rig had struck me. Fortunately, I wasn't at fault—but my drunken haze had surely dulled my reflexes, preventing me from possibly lessening the impact or avoiding it altogether.\n\nI still think someone had to be looking out for me at the hospital because I never had DUI charges brought against me.\n\nI digress...\n\nAfter the collision, everything immediately went black. I would say I sat in darkness for a while, but it wouldn't be accurate. If anyone can think of a way to describe experiencing \"nothing.\" It was that.\n\nAnd then, gradually, feeling came back to my body. The world around me slowly became a white blur that eventually formed into a crisp void. It was as if the universe had blinked out of existence only to slowly reform around me in its most basic state. One where nothing had been created yet.\n\nConsciousness returned in sluggish waves. My mind strained to answer the most basic questions. Before I could even ask, \"Where am I?\" I had to answer what \"Where am I\" even meant.\n\nIf you've ever been completely disoriented, you know how your mind scrambles to piece together reality in a desperate attempt to forge a larger, comprehensible picture.\n\nProblem is... I had no frame of reference for where I was. Even as my mind tried to catch up to my body, it searched for some kind of key to unlock the door of clarity. Only to find that even in the deepest recesses of my mind, that key didn't exist.\n\nGreat.\n\nI stood, and then, like a lightning bolt striking some repressed chord in my brain, everything returned to me. Who I was, where I was before the darkness and the best answers I could give to my pseudo-philosophical questions.\n\nFor a moment, it was painful. So much so that it briefly sent me back down to my knees. Not just because of the shock of the moment, but because I knew something about this place was still in there.\n\nThe void was warm. My previous drunkenness had gone. And I could breathe better than I ever could before. The air tasted sweet and smelled of apples.\n\nOdd.\n\nAll I could see was white. No external sound was present. Testing this, I yelled, but the sound simply vanished. No echo. My first thought was maybe I was in a dream, but using the tried and true method of trying to (lightly) injure myself, I found that it wasn't the case.\n\nMy clothes made it to where I was, but my car keys and phone didn't. With no means of communicating with anyone, the best thing I could think to do was walk.\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nFor how long? I couldn't even begin to tell you. The walk might've been one of the most disorientating parts of my \"adventure.\" One moment, it would feel like I had been walking for days. The next, I'd swear I had only been walking for a few minutes. The whole time, I never got tired or felt the need to eat or drink.\n\nMy perception of direction warped. What felt like walking in a straight line would suddenly morph into the unsettling suspicion of endless circles or random turns. There were no landmarks to offer reassurance, just the persistent, illogical sensation of constant motion leading to nowhere.\n\nI had to stop momentarily because I could feel my brain breaking.\n\nLooking back into the white expanse, I caught a glimpse of someone mirroring my build and face, but dressed in clothes I'd never seen. I shouted for the other me and dashed over, only for the figure to vanish instantly, leaving behind a surge of alien memories. Memories of experiences I apparently had but swore I'd never lived.\n\nWhat the fuck was this?\n\nThat was the moment I considered that I had to be in some sort of hell. Trapped forever in a silent void, doomed to go insane, surrounded by mirages and false memories.\n\nI slumped back into the nothingness, hopeful that even though I didn't need it, maybe I could try to sleep and wake up in a better place. At least one with people? Sounds? Something.\n\nI closed my eyes and attempted to drift off into sleep.\n\nIt was maybe five minutes of relentless dark before a sound pierced the silence: a whisper. A genuine murmur in this soundless realm. The words were indistinguishable, but I didn't care. I jolted upright, straining to hear. It persisted. I ran toward the sound, using it as a radar to find its source. The louder it became, the more desperate I was to head in its direction.\n\nCountless minutes, hours, and likely days went by. My sole goal was to follow this one link back to humanity until...\n\nI found them.\n\nThe whisper stopped. It was silent again.\n\nThe silence gave way to a disquieting scene. A vast sea of people extending infinitely into the void. Some dressed in grey robes, others wearing everyday clothes. Each was separated by about six to ten feet. Every single person knelt in deep prayer.\n\nMy gaze drifted upwards, mirroring the people down here; I noted countless dark lines etched against the white expanse. But my attention was soon stolen by something far more significant. Beyond the kneeling masses, a colossal form materialized on the horizon.\n\nAt first, I didn't know what to make of it. But the more I walked toward it, the more I understood. It sat there. I'd estimate it was many, many times the size of the largest object humanity has ever built.\n\nIt resembled a gargantuan brain, its silver surface slick with a viscous, translucent green slime, like a creature suspended within a gelatinous shroud. Elongated frontal lobes tapered into sharp, unsettling points.\n\nCountless tentacles extended from its body far into the distance. Two long eyestalks protruded from the top and bent back down to watch over the praying people. It never kept its gaze in one spot for long, but it certainly had more interest in some people than others.\n\nI looked around, and everyone stayed exactly where they were, praying toward this abomination. Instinctively, I shook the closest woman next to me. I tried to scream at her that we all needed to leave. I didn't know where to go, but this obviously wasn't safe. She didn't so much as flinch when I tried.\n\nNo time. I noticed I had caught the thing's attention.\n\nI moved to the next man, and I got the same response. Another one. Again, nothing.\n\n\"The hell is wrong with all of you?\" I thought. There was no possible way everyone here was entirely unaware of the looming monster.\n\nI looked up, and those stalks were already over me. They stretched down until they were mere feet from my face. It made some deep, booming, unintelligible sound that almost resembled language before its tiny pupils dilated and flashed a bright light at me.\n\nI didn't want to stick around and find out the reason for its interest. I sprinted in the other direction, pure terror guiding my feet in a random direction. I thought that finding people would be my salvation, only to realize that everyone else who made it here had found themselves in hell.\n\nNaive as I was, I thought I could outrun the thing until I was lofted into the air. One of its many slimy tentacles had wrapped around my body and was slowly making its way up my neck and deep inside my nostrils.\n\nThe black streaks closed in as I ascended into the sky. Only when we finally stopped did the horrifying truth reveal itself. They were people. *Fucking* people. Each was a lifeless puppet dangling from thick, invasive tentacles snaking into their nostrils.\n\nFor some, apparently, that wasn't enough for the creature. It had entered through their ear canals. For others… The tendrils opted to pierce directly through their eye sockets.\n\nI didn't know if anyone there was alive or dead. All I knew was that the bodies extended into the infinite as I looked out. As above, so below. Tentacles were branching off each other, constantly at work, continually bringing new people from the prayer pile into the sky with the rest of us.\n\nWhen I looked down, I could see some people being released, only for them to go straight back into prayer.\n\nI looked on in horror as tiny eyestalks emerged from the tentacle that had grabbed me. It looked deep into my eyes, and I could feel it reaching up my nasal cavity until it had penetrated my skull.\n\nI don't know how I didn't scream out in agony as it made contact with my brain. When it did, I assumed a horrific death wouldn't be far behind. My eyes rolled to the back of my head, but instead of liquifying my brain or pulling squishy-bloody chunks out through my nose, something amazing happened.\n\nI saw a cavalcade of colors. The entire spectrum of light, shades I didn't even know existed, danced before me. Strings of numbers and alien symbols flashed among them, forming equations, and somehow, I could process it all.\n\nFor each second I watched this display, massive repositories of information flowed through my mind, and I began to understand more than hundreds, maybe thousands, of minds could comprehend.\n\nThe numbers and colors blended together to form images I could feel. Images of me living past lives, not only as a human being, but all the way back to when we were single-celled organisms. Throughout all of time, every experience, every piece of knowledge, and every minuscule reaction to our world had been stored, and now, it was all coming back.\n\nMuch had changed through my experience, but there was one constant throughout it all. One force that was always guiding me beyond where I could see. More accurately, it guided *us* and our world in far too complex of ways for me to begin to understand, let alone relay.\n\nBut one thing was clear. He had somehow built much of our experience. He somehow had been the reason we were here. And we were all always meant to come back. And the reason why became clear.\n\nHe was God.\n\nNot the God of the false stories they tell on our tiny little rock. No. The human mind, or at least the one we currently experience, is far too simple to understand something beyond creation. Let alone even begin to conceptualize what such a being could be. Or its purpose.\n\nSee. We think in terms of ourselves. We believe such a being must look similar to us. Think similarly to us. Have goals that seem rather human. How naive. How do you explain a being that forms worlds using code and mathematics that our greatest quantum computers couldn't begin to calculate?\n\nA being that can communicate vast amounts of information through a precise showing of color so effectively that even someone who had never seen its displays before would always understand it perfectly? A being with an absolute understanding of our universe, down to its most minute principles. This not only allows such a being the ability to predict all future events perfectly but also allows it to adjust those principles as it sees fit.\n\nI'm sure that even the form I saw wasn't truly what it looked like. It was simply my mind's best guess as to what I was seeing.\n\nThe funny thing was, as I remained suspended there, absorbing this information, it became clear that I had been there before. We all have. We have all had these revelations and have been one of those people praying before him, hoping he would allow us to see just a fraction of a fraction of what he knows. Allowing for a glimpse into the infinite.\n\nThen, as abruptly as all this began, it was simply over. The void dissolved, replaced by a hospital room's stark, sterile white. Blurry shapes gradually sharpened into the mundane reality of medical equipment. My mind struggled to ask the fundamental questions of what happened and where I was.\n\nOf course, I didn't remember anything that happened. None of us do.\n\nAnd like everyone else, I would've moved on and gone on with the rest of my life. But recently, I've had these \"dreams.\" I call them \"dreams,\" though they feel like a continuous, unbroken experience that sometimes bleeds into the edges of my waking perception.\n\nIn them, I'm back at that place, talking with the version of me I attempted to speak within the void. He tells me of my last experience there, and that time works in such a way that there is always a version of myself exploring. Sometimes simultaneously.\n\nTo prove it's real, I ask about things in my world. Things I have no business knowing but with the understanding that a version of me with this vast knowledge should. Every single answer given to me has turned out to be true.\n\nI don't know where I heard this from, but someone suggested that our minds are almost like radios. Under the right conditions, we can tune into specific frequencies from outside our realm of existence. I don't know if that's what's happening here, but it fits.\n\nAs I walk through this place in my dreams, more comes back. Sometimes, I lose other pieces, and I'm sure there are events I don't recognize now that will return later. In fact, I'm almost certain that, given enough time, I won't remember any of it. It's a big reason I'm writing this down now.\n\nAs I talk to my other self, he explains that he has this theory that there's a reason for all of this. That \"He\" has some purpose for all of us, but needs us to reach a point where we can understand what was meant to happen. That part still keeps me awake at night...\n\nBut I suppose there's something that we need to have a certain amount of knowledge to do. There's a level that each of us has to attain to even begin to communicate with him on *his* level, let alone become what is needed.\n\nAs for me, I don't think it was my time to stop learning in this form. At the same time, I can't help but think that my going through that and relaying it to all of you was part of his plan. The truth is, I'm not the only person to speak of their experience with death. Maybe we need all of those people to talk about their experiences to really get an understanding of what we're dealing with. Just a hypothesis.\n\nStill though. The more I think about that place and my time there, the more questions I have. Honestly, it's been driving me kind of crazy, so I'm hoping that after I get this out, I'll be able to stop thinking about it for a while.\n\nI just can't shake the feeling that some bad events are coming down the pipeline, either. They always do, of course, but something says that a uniquely devastating event is coming for our species. I lost almost all of the information that flowed through me in that place, but I think something must've stuck. Some combined insight points to our world heading toward a truly awful experience.\n\nThink about it. This \"God\" never showed any signs of being particularly good or loving. Knowledgeable, yes. Yet, this same entity has overseen every mass extinction, every bombing, every act of human cruelty. The fact is, there's a lot of learning through pain.\n\nI've become more fearful, knowing what's out there but not knowing what it desires.\n\nAnd yet, a good part of me still wants to go back. But that place has a grip on my mind like nothing else. I'd be lying if I said that knowledge wasn't absolutely intoxicating. Far beyond anything on earth could ever be.\n\nWhat more did I know? What does it want with us? Sometimes, I lie awake just thinking about everything it could share. These are questions that a million of us wouldn't think of asking. And the answers a billion of us are dying to know. Knowing all that knowledge is just over the edge of death... And how easy it would be to just tip over. Let myself free-fall back into the void, back into a place where I can beg for that fraction of a fraction.\n\nDon't worry. I plan on living until the day I die from *natural* causes. But it's something I live with.\n\nAnd it makes me question how many people that place sticks with on some deeper level. Many of us don't even know we want to return there. Because in reality, we belong there. It's where all of us are destined to be. The one place we all know is at the end of our journey.\n\nI could go on forever with these questions, but there isn't enough time in the world to answer them. So I simply want to thank those who made it this far. You can't imagine how good it feels to get this off my chest. For those who have experienced something similar or had their own unique experiences on the other side, I'd love to hear from you as well.\n\nPlease, take care of each other and yourselves. And remember, there's no need to spend too much time staring into the abyss. The abyss is already waiting for all of us."},"66":{"title":"There's a black spot in my refrigerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kelbik\/theres_a_black_spot_in_my_refrigerator\/","flair":null,"author":"JakeWhyman","selftext":"There's a black spot in my refrigerator. I’m not a germaphobe, or have OCD, or whatever… but for whatever reason it's disturbing me. I had to pull out all of my leftovers, eggs, and half-used condiments from the shelf and pile them onto my counter. Now there's a desolate section in my refrigerator with a single black spot on the back wall staring at me. \n\nI scrubbed it with a sponge. \nStill a spot. \nI wiped a disinfectant wipe. \nThe spot unrelented. \nI grabbed just about every cleaning tool I had and proceeded to assault the spot. \nThe spot prevailed. \n\nI began to wonder what the hell caused this spot. Was it a prank? It couldn’t have been a permanent marker. Who’d take the effort to remove all of my food and reach all the way to the back wall of the fridge just to make a little spot to annoy me? I live alone with my cat, so I have no suspects. The entire interior of the refrigerator was impeccably clean except for that black spot. Maybe it's mold?\n\nI looked up online on how to remove mold from a refrigerator. An AI overview gave me the following: “To remove mold from a refrigerator, unplug it, empty it, and thoroughly clean all surfaces with a solution of vinegar, baking soda, or a diluted bleach solution. Rinse and dry all surfaces, then deodorize with baking soda or lemon wedges.” Seems easy enough. \n\nWell, it wasn't really that easy enough. My refrigerator wouldn't budge. Step one was to unplug it and I'm struggling to just do that. So I figured “what the hell” and skipped that step. I grabbed some vinegar and baking soda from the cupboard. It brought back childhood memories of making a dumb volcano for class. Who knew you could use them together as a cleaning solution? I mixed them together in a spray bottle and it erupted everywhere. I frantically screwed in the spray nozzle with what little solution was left in the bottle. Hopefully this works. \n\nI walked back to my refrigerator and opened the door.\nDid the black spot get slightly bigger?\nI shrugged it off and began to spray the “classroom volcano solution” onto the spot. It started to foam up around it. I let the white foam linger for a bit as I decided to heat up some leftover pizza while I waited. I didn't want to put my food to waste. \n\nI grabbed a few slices from the pizza box and threw them in the microwave for a couple of minutes. As it spun around in the microwave I looked back into the refrigerator. The white foam turned black and appeared to harden. What the hell?! I quickly grabbed a sponge and tried to scrub it off. It had a weird texture to it as I felt it through the sponge. It resembled a hollow ceramic-like shell with hundreds of tiny holes around it. Almost like a really dry sponge or coral?\n\nThis is weird… \nI don't know if I'm just seeing things but it seems to be slowly growing. \n\nI really didn't know what to do now, so I decided to put the eggs and condiments into the bottom drawer of the refrigerator (the furthest away from the growing black coral tumor) and shut the door. It's 10:17pm and I decided the next course of action was to call some sort of specialist in the morning. \n\nMy cat rubbed against my leg. It's his dinner time. So I headed into the cupboard and grabbed a can of food for him. As he ate, I began to stare at the refrigerator. \nIs it weird to have an ominous feeling from a refrigerator? \n\nI headed to bed. The refrigerator can wait until morning. It's not like it'll run off or anything.\n\nAs I shut my eyes all I could imagine was the black spot. My eyes seemed to intently magnify into it. A black void surrounded by a white emptiness. The refrigerator’s hum amplified into my ears. The void began to extrude like a foamy bubble. Little black dots spawn in a ring formation around it like ants or TV static. It began to spread as it spun in circles around the tumorous black growth. \n\nMy eyes shot open. My hands in a cold sweat. I glanced at my phone. It was 12:58am. I turned on my bedside lamp only to see something that made me wish I was just dreaming.\n\nMy bedroom wall was breathing.\n\nThe gentle rhythm of my breathing synced with the subtle expansion and contraction of the plaster. It was a slow, deliberate pulse, like a hidden lung inflating and deflating behind the paint. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the eerie stillness of the room.\n\nI blinked, trying to clear the sleep from my eyes, desperately hoping it was just a trick of the light, a lingering fragment of the nightmare. But it persisted. The wall, a solid, inanimate object, was alive.\n\nTerror, cold and sharp, pierced through my grogginess. I scrambled out of bed, my bare feet hitting the cool wood floor. As I moved, the breathing seemed to intensify, the undulation becoming more pronounced. It was as if the wall was reacting to my movement, aware of my fear.\n\nI backed away slowly, my gaze fixed on the unsettling rhythm. The black spots from my dream flashed in my vision, and a horrifying thought took root: what if the spot in the refrigerator wasn't just growing *in* the appliance, but *through* it? What if it was spreading, infecting my home?\n\nMy cat, usually a sound sleeper, rose from the foot of the bed, his back arched, a low growl rumbling in his chest. His eyes, wide and reflecting the dim lamplight, were fixed on the wall. He saw it too.\n\nA new sound joined the breathing: a faint, wet scratching coming from within the wall. It was a delicate, skittering sound, like tiny claws dragging across a damp surface. The breathing quickened, and the scratching grew more frantic, more insistent.\n\nI had to see. I had to know.\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for my phone to turn on the flashlight. The light cast long, dancing shadows across the breathing wall, highlighting the subtle shifts in its surface.\n\nThen, a small crack appeared. A thin, jagged line snaked across the plaster, following the rhythm of the unseen movement behind it. The scratching intensified, becoming a frantic tearing. More cracks spiderwebbed across the wall, and a wet, squelching sound emerged.\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat. Something was trying to get out.\n\nThe largest bulge on the wall began to darken, the paint seeming to absorb the light. A familiar blackness bloomed, spreading like ink in water. It was the same impossible black as the spot in the refrigerator, but now it was seeping into my bedroom, alive and growing.\n\nThe scratching reached a fever pitch, and with a sickening tearing sound, the plaster finally gave way. A hole, jagged and black, opened in my wall.\n\nAnd from within, something reached out.\n\nIt wasn't a hand, not exactly. It was long and slender, the color of dried blood, with too many joints and far too many fingers, each tipped with a sharp, obsidian nail. It writhed and flexed, testing the air, and a faint, sweet, sickly odor wafted from the opening.\n\nMy cat hissed, a guttural sound I'd never heard before, and darted under the bed. I stood frozen, my phone clattering to the floor, my terror paralyzing me.\n\nThe thing in the wall began to pull itself through the hole, its movements jerky and unnatural. More of its elongated body emerged, glistening and segmented like some monstrous insect. Its head, when it finally appeared, was a smooth, black orb with no discernible features, save for a single, pulsing white dot that seemed to focus directly on me.\n\nThe breathing I'd heard from the wall now came from this creature, a wet, rattling sound that echoed the nightmare in my refrigerator. The black spot had found a way out, and it had brought something with it.\n\nMy stomach churned. I thought I felt the need to throw up, but my stomach was empty. My hunger pangs amplified tenfold, a gnawing emptiness that mirrored the void in the creature's gaze. It wasn't just a physical hunger; it was a deep, primal craving, a need for something I couldn't name. Its emptiness was contagious. \n\nThe creature took a step, its multi-jointed limbs clicking against the floorboards. The white dot on its head intensified, and I felt a pull, a sickening invitation into the darkness it represented.\n\nThe refrigerator's hum, which had faded into the background, now roared in my ears, a deafening drone that vibrated through my bones. The black spot wasn't just in the kitchen anymore. It was here. It was in the walls. It was coming for me! And at that moment I remembered… I forgot the pizza in the microwave. \n\nMy own breath hitched, mirroring the creature’s wet rattle. The air in the room grew colder, a deep, bone-chilling cold that had nothing to do with the late hour. The sweet, sickly odor intensified, now laced with a metallic tang that made my eyes water.\n\nAnother sound joined the symphony of dread – a low, guttural hum emanating from the black orb of the creature’s head. The white dot pulsed faster, and I felt a pressure building behind my eyes, a silent scream trapped in my skull.\n\nThen, the refrigerator hum, which had been a background drone, suddenly spiked, a violent, erratic buzzing that seemed to vibrate through the very foundations of the house. The light from the open refrigerator door in the other room flickered and died, plunging the apartment into near darkness, save for the faint glow of my phone on the floor and the unsettling luminescence of the creature’s single white eye.\n\nThe creature took another step, closer this time. I could see now that its segmented body wasn’t insect-like, but composed of countless tiny black filaments, writhing and shifting like a living shadow. As it moved, small black dots, identical to those I’d seen in my dream, drifted from its form and dissipated into the air.\n\nMy cat, emboldened by some primal instinct or perhaps just desperate to escape the suffocating dread, darted from under the bed and streaked towards the bedroom door. The creature’s head snapped in its direction, the white dot fixating on the fleeing form. A long, black tendril, impossibly thin and fast, shot out from its body, snaring my cat mid-leap. A choked yelp was the last sound he made before he was pulled back into the darkness of the hole in the wall.\n\nThe white dot returned its unwavering gaze to me. The humming intensified, resonating deep within my chest. The hunger, the emptiness, became unbearable, a gaping void that threatened to consume me.\n\nThe creature took a final, deliberate step. Its shadow stretched long and distorted across the floor, engulfing my feet. The black filaments at its base seemed to writhe with anticipation.\n\nAnd then, the pulsing white dot went dark.\n\nThe humming stopped. The refrigerator hum fell silent. The sweet, sickly odor vanished. The cold receded.\n\nThe creature stood motionless, a silhouette against the jagged hole in the wall. For a moment, a sliver of desperate hope flickered within me. Had it… stopped?\n\nThen, slowly, impossibly, the black orb of its head began to rotate. It turned a full 360 degrees, the smooth, featureless surface reflecting the faint light from my phone. And as it completed its rotation, a single, new white dot appeared on the opposite side.\n\nIt was still watching.\n\nAnd somewhere, deep within the silence, I thought I heard the faintest of sounds. A wet, anticipatory clicking, like something savoring a meal it had only just begun. The black spot hadn't just come out of the refrigerator. It had brought the refrigerator with it. And now, I was inside.\n\nIt’s dark and cold. My body shivering and my eyes welling up in tears. This has to be a nightmare. \nI blindly crawl forward as I reach around for my phone. My right hand’s knuckle knocked against something hard. A spinning light moved violently ahead of me. My phone!\n\nI scrambled up to the phone and grabbed it. The shining light revealed a long corridor of white glossy walls. My phone still worked! My body shook as I crawled a few inches forward on my knees. I looked around me for any sign of the black spot. Nothing. \n\nI began to feel a slight vibration around me for a few seconds and then I heard a click. And now silence…\nI frantically looked around me, swinging my phone light everywhere. I need to find a way out!\n\nThe silence was more terrifying than the humming had been. It was a pregnant silence, heavy with an unseen presence. The air, still frigid, now carried a faint, metallic echo of the earlier clicking sound, as if unseen mechanisms were shifting and locking into place around me.\n\nThe glossy white walls of the corridor stretched ahead, an oppressive, sterile expanse that offered no comfort or clue. They seemed to absorb the light from my phone, reflecting nothing back, making the passage ahead look endless and unknowable. There were no doors, no seams, no discernible features, just smooth, unbroken white.\n\nI pressed my ear against the wall, straining to hear anything beyond the frantic thumping of my own heart. Nothing. Just a deep, unsettling stillness that hinted at something immense and dormant surrounding me.\n\nMy breath hitched as I noticed a subtle discoloration spreading across the pristine white wall directly in front of me. It started as a faint grayness, like dust particles gathering, but it was growing, darkening, and swirling in impossible patterns. It was the blackness, but diffused, like a shadow bleeding into the light.\n\nPanic clawed at my throat. It wasn't just in the refrigerator anymore. It wasn't just in the walls. It was *here*, in this strange, silent place.\n\nAs the grayness intensified, the air began to vibrate again, a low thrumming that resonated in my teeth. The clicking sound returned, closer this time, a series of sharp, precise snaps that seemed to be coming from within the walls themselves. It sounded like locks engaging, or perhaps… teeth snapping shut.\n\nThe blackness on the wall emerged, forming indistinct shapes that writhed and shifted like ink in water. And then, a single, familiar white dot appeared within the swirling darkness, it's cold luminescence piercing the oppressive white.\n\nIt was watching me. Still.\n\nThe vibrations grew stronger, and the clicking became a rapid, rhythmic succession. The glossy white walls began to subtly pulse, mirroring the breathing I had witnessed in my bedroom. The corridor seemed to be constricting, the air growing thick and heavy.\n\nI stumbled backward, my hand instinctively reaching out to the wall behind me for support. My fingers brushed against something cold and slick. I turned my phone light downwards.\n\nEmbedded in the pristine white was a row of small, perfectly circular indentations. They were black, impossibly black, and arranged in a precise, unsettling pattern. And as I watched, one of them began to slowly dilate, opening like a tiny, lidless eye.\n\nMore of the black circles began to open, each one fixated on me. The clicking intensified, and a new sound emerged from the walls – a soft, wet sighing, like something exhaling with terrible anticipation.\n\nThe corridor wasn't just a hallway. It was a throat. And the black spots… they weren't just spots.\n\nThey were waiting. And I was walking deeper inside.\n\nEscape wasn't a concept that seemed to exist in this place. The smooth, unyielding walls offered no openings, no cracks to exploit. The ever-watching black eyes provided no hint of exit, only a chilling anticipation.\n\nDesperation clawed at my reason, but a primal instinct for survival, however futile it seemed, took over. I had to move. Staying still felt like waiting to be consumed.\n\nClutching my phone, I began to run down the white corridor, the beam of light shaking wildly in front of me. My footsteps echoed strangely in the oppressive silence, each sound feeling amplified, as if alerting whatever lurked in the walls to my frantic flight.\n\nThe black eyes embedded in the walls tracked my movement, their gaze unwavering. As I ran, more of them opened, until the walls on either side were lined with rows upon rows of silent, black observers. The wet sighing intensified, a chorus of anticipation that seemed to emanate from the very structure of this place.\n\nThe corridor stretched on, impossibly long. There were no turns, no intersections, just the endless white and the countless black eyes. It felt like running on a treadmill in a nightmare, expending all my energy but going nowhere.\n\nAhead, the blackness in the wall intensified, swirling and solidifying. The single white dot pulsed faster, and the humming, faint at first, began to build again, a low, resonant drone that vibrated in my bones.\n\nThe corridor began to narrow, the smooth white walls pressing in on either side. I could feel the subtle undulation against my shoulders, the breathing of this monstrous place becoming more pronounced, more insistent.\n\nThen, the clicking started again, closer than ever. It seemed to be coming from directly behind me, a rapid, rhythmic snapping that sounded like teeth grinding. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder.\n\nThe blackness on the wall behind me was extruding, forming a long, slender shape that writhed and pulsed. And at its tip, a single obsidian nail glinted in the beam of my phone light.\n\nThe corridor was closing in. The eyes were watching. Something was pursuing me.\n\nEscape wasn't an option. Survival was a rapidly dwindling possibility. All that remained was to keep moving forward, deeper into the belly of the beast. \n\nMy phone's battery was draining much slower than I thought it would. The clock says it's only 1:13am. Time seems to be running slower the deeper I go. Where was this corridor taking me?! Am I dead? Is this Limbo?! \n\nWhat I know for sure is that I can only go in one direction and that's forward. If I stop for long enough, I have the unnerving feeling that the pulsating black void will impale me with its lone long sharp tendril that's following me ever so slowly. Thank god I can type all this while I walk. \n\nI did have thoughts of calling someone for help but who would believe me? Even if they did, what could they do? What does my apartment look like? Had the moldy void consumed the entire building? The entire neighborhood?! \n\nI heard a meow coming from within the corridor. \n\nThe meow was faint, a pathetic, drawn-out sound that echoed eerily in the sterile white. It was undeniably my cat. But how could he be here? Had that tendril not… ? A fresh wave of nausea rolled over me, the image of his small body being dragged back into the wall flashing in my mind.\n\nHope, fragile and foolish, flickered within the despair. If he was here, maybe there was a way out. Or maybe this was just another cruel trick of this impossible place, a lure to draw me further into its depths.\n\n\"Benji?\" I whispered, my voice cracking. \"Benji, are you there?\"\n\nAnother meow answered, closer this time, seemingly coming from further down the corridor. I started running again, my fear momentarily overshadowed by a desperate need to find him.\n\nThe black eyes in the walls seemed to intensify their gaze, their silent observation feeling more predatory now. The pulsating black void behind me continued its relentless pursuit, the obsidian nail glinting menacingly in the weakening beam of my phone.\n\nAs I rounded a subtle curve in the seemingly endless corridor, the white walls shifted slightly, angling inwards. The air grew colder still, and a new scent filled the sterile void – a faint, metallic tang, overlaid with something sickly sweet, the same odor I'd noticed when the creature first emerged from my bedroom wall.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nAt the end of the narrowing corridor, the white walls opened into a vast, circular chamber. The walls here were no longer smooth but ribbed and pulsating with a soft, internal light. In the center of the chamber, bathed in an eerie glow, was a colossal, pulsating black orb. It was easily the size of my entire apartment, its surface covered in a network of writhing black filaments and countless open, black eyes.\n\nAnd suspended within its shadowy depths, struggling weakly, was my cat.\n\nA low, resonant hum filled the chamber, emanating from the giant orb.  filled the chamber, emanating from the giant orb. It was the same humming I'd heard before, but amplified a hundredfold, vibrating through my very being.\n\nThe single white dot I'd seen on the smaller creature now manifested as a swirling vortex of light on the surface of this colossal entity, its gaze all-encompassing, all-knowing.\n\nThe black void that had been pursuing me detached itself from the wall and floated into the chamber, its long, sharp tendril twitching. It moved towards the giant orb, its movements subservient, almost reverent.\n\nUnderstanding crashed down on me, cold and absolute. This wasn't Limbo. This wasn't a nightmare. This was the source. The black spot, the breathing wall, the creature… they were all extensions of this massive, malevolent entity. And the refrigerator… it wasn't just a gateway. It was a part of it.\n\nThe giant orb pulsed again, and the humming intensified. The black eyes fixed on me, and I felt that same sickening pull, that overwhelming hunger, amplified to an unbearable degree. This wasn't just about consuming my apartment or my neighborhood. It wanted everything. It wanted *me*.\n\nMy phone slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor, its light casting a weak beam on the pulsating walls. I was trapped. There was no escape. This corridor hadn't been leading me away from the horror. It had been leading me directly to its heart.\n\nAnd as the giant black orb pulsed again, a new sound echoed through the chamber, a wet, anticipatory clicking that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.\n\nIt was hungry and it was leading me right to it.\n\nI picked up my phone again and then realized what the new sound was. It was a familiar low whirring. I looked towards the left edge of the pulsating wall about six feet away from the orb. A glowing cube covered in an undulating ooze. \n\nThe microwave!\n\nI could faintly see the timer on it through the wiggling slimy ooze. It's clock ticking down so slowly. It had been running this entire time. This has to be the longest 2 minutes I’ve ever seen! Now it says it has only 16 seconds left, but that could take hours. \n\nThe longer I stared at the timer the slower it went. It took me a few moments to realize that the black eyes all over the walls were also staring at it as well. I shook my phone light around. The eyes looked back at me for a moment. The timer ticked down. \n\nWherever they looked, time slowed. \n\nI began jumping and waving my light around. A myriad of eyes looking up on me. I had a plan. \n\nI needed to distract as many eyes so that the microwave would finish cooking. I know it sounds crazy and\/or stupid, but what if it was just hungry for the pizza? Wouldn’t I be dead and eaten already if it wasn't? I had to at least try!\n\nThe whirring of the microwave, a sound so mundane, was now the only beacon of potential salvation in this terrifying abyss. The undulating ooze covering it seemed to writhe in sync with the pulsating walls, a grotesque parody of cooking food.\n\nSixteen seconds. Each tick of the digital timer felt like an eternity, stretched and distorted by the countless black eyes fixated upon it. My frantic waving of the phone light was the only thing that seemed to momentarily draw their attention away, their gaze shifting from the glowing cube to my desperate flailing.\n\nThe colossal black orb in the center of the chamber remained still, its swirling white vortex of an eye seemingly observing everything, a silent, malevolent overseer. The smaller black void with its obsidian tendril hovered nearby, its movements mirroring the subtle pulses of the larger entity.\n\nMy heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic rhythm against the slow, deliberate ticking of the microwave timer. Could this truly work? Could this cosmic horror be appeased by lukewarm leftover pizza? The thought was ludicrous, yet it was the only sliver of hope I had.\n\nWith a renewed surge of adrenaline, I began to move more erratically, leaping and spinning, casting the beam of my phone light across the pulsating walls. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of black eyes swiveled to follow the light, their attention momentarily diverted from the agonizingly slow countdown.\n\nEach second felt like a lifetime. The timer blinked: 15… 14… The whirring of the microwave seemed to grow louder, a defiant hum against the oppressive silence of the chamber.\n\nThe black void with the tendril twitched, its attention flickering between my movements and the glowing cube. The colossal orb remained impassive, its swirling eye a vortex of unknowable intent.\n\n13… 12… My muscles screamed in protest, my movements becoming jerky and uncoordinated. But I couldn't stop. The fate of my cat, my apartment, perhaps even more, rested on these absurd, desperate actions.\n\n11… 10… A low growl rumbled from the direction of the pursuing black void. Its obsidian nail flexed, a clear sign of its growing impatience.\n\n9… 8… The pulsating walls seemed to constrict slightly, the soft internal light intensifying. The air grew thick with anticipation.\n\n7… 6… My phone light flickered, the battery finally beginning to succumb to the prolonged use. Panic flared anew.\n\n5… 4… The black eyes on the walls seemed to multiply, their gaze more intense, more focused on the glowing microwave. My frantic movements were losing their effectiveness.\n\n3… 2… The whirring of the microwave reached a fever pitch. The ooze covering it bubbled and shifted more violently.\n\n1…\n\nA loud *PING!* echoed through the chamber.\n\nThe whirring stopped. The ooze on the microwave stilled. The timer on the display went dark.\n\nSilence descended once more, heavier and more profound than before. All the black eyes, including the swirling vortex of the colossal orb, were now fixed on the silent, glowing cube.\n\nI held my breath, every nerve in my body screaming. Had it worked? Had my insane gamble paid off?\n\nThen, slowly, deliberately, the colossal black orb began to rotate. Its countless eyes remained fixed on the microwave. And as it completed its rotation, a single, enormous maw, lined with rows upon rows of razor-sharp teeth, silently opened on its opposite side.\n\nAnd all the eyes were now looking at me.\n\nIt was do or die. \n\nI dashed towards the microwave. My hands sliding around its ooze-covered exterior trying to find the “open” button. It was steaming hot. I grab the edges of where the microwave door would be and frantically pull. Black slimy tendrils were holding the door shut like a hundred rubber bands. I tugged and tugged. I looked behind me as I was pulling. The black orb’s groups of eyes parted as its mouth slipped into position. Two clusters of eyes with its gaping maw right in the middle. It was now inching closer and closer!\n\nI desperately lift my right leg while pulling the door with both hands and kick the right side of the microwave with all my might! My heel managed to connect with the “open” button as I was pulling and the microwave door snapped open. A glowing light emitted from within its warm interior. A familiar steamy cheesy smell engulfed the room. \n\nThe orb’s eyes dilated. It's mouth drooling thick slimy black tar. In a frenzy, I lifted up the microwave and slammed it into the orb’s mouth. Within seconds of it devouring the microwave, I punched the “popcorn” button. Sparks flew! The orb's eyes rolled back and shined blue! Ooze everywhere began to writhe and wiggle violently! It all receded into the walls as the orb began to melt with it. It's eyes popping like popcorn kernels! The smell of vinegar and baking soda hit my nostrils and a smile grew on my face! \n\nI collapsed onto the floor and looked around me. My kitchen has gone back to normal. All the ooze disintegrated except a small pile slowly inching away. It was headed towards the refrigerator. From the corner of my eye I saw a blurry mass fly from the counter. Benji with his claws out pounced towards the ooze. I quickly got up, kicked the refrigerator door closed, and snatched Benji up. The ooze barely made it into the refrigerator as it slowly melted into the floor. \n\nI won!\n\nI then placed Benji back on the counter and gave him a treat from the cupboard. With a sigh of relief, I began to clean up around the kitchen. Deciding that it had been long enough, I opened the refrigerator door. \n\nSpotless!\n\nAs it should be.\n\nI go to the bottom drawer, put the condiments back on the shelf, and then grab the eggs. \n\nOne of the eggs slipped from my fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a black spot on one of the eggs…\n\n"},"67":{"title":"I Took Another Cryptids Confession Today.

Officer Kellar had been stationed outside its cell. No breach, no protocol failure, just a moment of stillness where the air “got thick,” as the medics put it. Then the screaming started. They found him with both eardrums ruptured, eyes rolled back, muttering the same three words on loop: “It’s still singing.”\n\nHe’s unresponsive now. Last I heard, they moved him to Site 6’s deep psych ward.\n\nThe Hart’s in solitary confinement—separated by triple-layered opaque shielding and lined with sigil-bonded concrete. I’ve already submitted a request to speak with it again. It’ll take time. They’re “reassessing clearance hierarchy.” I don’t think they want me near it.\n\nIn the meantime, they gave me someone else.\n\nTYPE-9 – Alias: “The Hollow-Faced Boy”\n\nI wasn’t briefed beyond that. Just the name, a transcript ID, and a whispered warning from another staffer:\n“Don’t ask it questions. Let it talk.”\nThe containment room was colder than usual. Not physically—emotionally. Sterile. Dead. Like the walls had given up on holding in heat.\n\nThe boy was already sitting across from me when I entered.\n\nHe looked no older than ten.\n\nGray hoodie. Pale legs. Dirty fingernails.\n\nExcept he had no face.\n\nNot like a wound. Not blank skin. Just… missing. Like the front of his skull had been swallowed by shadow. You could see the suggestion of teeth, sometimes. Like something grinning just beyond the veil.\n\nThey hadn’t cuffed him. No restraints. Just that same red line between us.\n\nHe didn’t move for a long time. Then, without lifting his head, he started to speak.\n\n“There are tunnels beneath the world. And there are children in them.”\n\nHis voice was too clear. Too precise. Like it wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way sound should. More like it was bypassing my ears and threading itself directly into my thoughts.\n\n“They dig with their fingers. They sing with no tongues. They make new gods out of broken ones.”\n\nI kept still. I wanted to speak, to ask protocol questions, but something about the cadence of his words made my throat close.\n\n“We are what’s left when a name is used too many times and then forgotten. When you lose a child in the dark and find it again—changed. That’s us. That’s me.”\n\nThe red line dimmed.\n\nI wrote that down in real time. I saw the lights flicker above us and checked the feed log later—no power drop. No fluctuations. But the line faded. Just for a second.\n\nThen he stood.\n\nI didn’t even see him move—I just realized he was standing.\n\n“They called me from the roots. Pulled my voice out through the soil. My first breath was a scream. But they made me hold it in.”\n\nHe took one step forward. Still behind the line. But the air in the room pulled inward like a vacuum. My skin went tight. My vision blurred.\n\n“There is something under your feet that remembers the shape of you. One day, it will wear it again.”\n\nThen he smiled.\n\nI couldn’t see his mouth, but I knew. Like my spine knew. Like my blood whispered it to my bones.\n\nAnd then—like nothing happened—he sat back down and went silent.\n\nThe session ended itself. I didn’t hit the buzzer. I didn’t move. The door just unlocked. Security pulled me out like I was sleepwalking.\n\nI went back to my quarters and threw up.\n\nWhen I checked the audio logs, they were corrupted. Distorted beyond recognition—except for the moment he said “One day, it will wear it again.”\n\nThat part was crystal clear.\n\nAnd it’s been playing on repeat in my head ever since.\n\nI still haven’t heard back on my request to see the Wailing Hart.\n\nBut I think the Boy was a message.\n\nNot a replacement.\n\nA warning.\n\n[Internal Department File – Confessional Transcript #43-B]\nClergy Consultant: [Redacted]\nSubject: TYPE-9 (“The Hollow-Faced Boy”)\nSession 2 – Approved Continuation\nSecurity Presence: Standard – Non-invasive Monitoring\nDate: [REDACTED]\n\nThey sent me back in less than twenty-four hours.\n\nNo explanation. No clearance change. Just a sealed envelope slid under my door marked REPEAT INTERACTION AUTHORIZED in black stencil.\n\nThe Boy was already in the chair again when I arrived. Same posture. Same dirt-caked hoodie. Same darkness where a face should be. You could almost convince yourself it was just a child.\n\nIf you didn’t look too long.\n\nIf you didn’t listen.\n\nI sat down without speaking.\n\nHe tilted his head to the side, like he was studying me without eyes.\n\n“Do you want to see what I used to be?”\n\nNo prep. No intro. Just that.\n\nI didn’t respond.\n\nI didn’t need to.\n\nHe reached into his own shadow.\n\nNot physically. Not with hands. With something else. Like a gesture that happened in concept rather than motion. And for a moment, I saw something formless and terrible beneath the table. Something older than the shape it was wearing.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\n“They put my name in a mirror,” he said softly.\n\n“And fed it to itself until it forgot how to stop.”\n\nI started recording manually. I didn’t trust the room’s systems anymore. Last session’s audio came back scrambled—except the one sentence. I didn’t want to risk losing this.\n\nHe started to hum.\n\nIt wasn’t music. Not really. Just three tones in a loop.\n\nHigh. Low. Silence.\n\nHigh. Low. Silence.\n\nAnd with each cycle, the shadows in the corners of the room stretched further along the walls.\n\n“There was a town once. It had too many mouths and not enough teeth.”\n\n“So they pulled the teeth from the children.”\n\n“And buried them beneath the school.”\n\nHe leaned in, though he didn’t move.\n\nThe distance between us got smaller. Not spatially—existentially. Like the concept of space was thinning.\n\n“I lived in the gap between recess and when the bell rang. I lived in the hallway no one remembers walking through. I lived in the cough just before someone says your name.”\n\nI wanted to breathe but forgot how. My ribs locked up like something unseen was coiling around them.\n\nHe spoke one more time.\n\nNo expression. No malice. Just fact:\n\n“You carried a name before this one. You buried it in the fire. Do you remember what it was?”\n\nMy hand jerked. I dropped the pen. And for a split second, I felt something else inside me trying to answer.\n\nBut it didn’t speak.\n\nIt just listened.\n\nThe lights never flickered this time.\n\nNo alarms.\n\nNo documentation flagged the session as unusual.\n\nAnd yet I left that room different.\n\nLike part of me didn’t leave with the rest.\n\nI haven’t listened to the recording yet. I’m afraid it will remember more than I do.\n\nI submitted another request to speak with the Wailing Hart. Still no reply. But I’ve started dreaming about the sound of teeth tapping glass. Slow. Rhythmic. Measured.\n\nLike someone knocking.\n\nLike someone waiting.\n\nI haven’t listened to the recording yet. I’m afraid it will remember more than I do.\n\nI submitted another request to speak with the Wailing Hart. Still no reply.\n\nBut tonight, when I returned to my quarters, there was a new envelope waiting.\n\nSame black stencil.\n\nNo instructions.\n\nJust one line stamped on the inside:\n\n“REQUEST APPROVED – SUBJECT 37-A”\n\nThey’re letting me see it again.\n\nGod help me. I’m going back in.\n\n"},"68":{"title":"I work as a karaoke host. Someone requested a very strange song.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kef26g\/i_work_as_a_karaoke_host_someone_requested_a_very\/","flair":"Self Harm","author":"starryquarry","selftext":"I work a lot of side hustles, as you do to make ends meet in this economy. One of them is hosting karaoke at a local club every week. Let me be honest, I love karaoke, I love the club, but it can be a thankless job. People rushing me to have their turn next. People not responding no matter how many times I call them to the stage (including the people begging to be up next just a few minutes ago.) Technical issues. You know the deal. When I showed up at 9pm, I was relieved that it looked to be a chill night. This means I can get a couple of songs in too.\n\nIt was a fairly normal night by all measures. The usual crowd did the usual My Way and Piano Man. I had the club groove to Can’t Get You Out of My Head and mosh to All Signs Point to Lauderdale. It was just past midnight when a man I’ve never seen before walked in, and started writing down his song request on one of the slips we provided.\n\nTo give you more info on how karaoke works at our club, we connect YouTube to our TVs and sound systems, so we aren’t limited to the roster of a specific server, and can play anything with a karaoke version on YouTube, including fanmade ones for the more obscure songs and artists. I grabbed the slip once he was done, ready to place it in the pile of requests, noticing that he wrote his name down as “Dis”. “New phone who Dis?” I chuckled at the thought. But seeing the song and artist name puzzled me a lot.\n\nThe song name was written down as “Slldfgvbgjh yjbtgwhm” and the artist name was “cbvmntprq jmlygkpzx”.\n\nI looked toward Dis, who was getting a drink at the bar. All in all he looked like a regular guy, nothing out of the ordinary. Average height, blonde hair, dark eyes and a goatee, wearing a plain black T-shirt and faded black jeans. There was a large tattoo on his left forearm, although I couldn’t make out exactly what it was in the dim light.\n\nHe was meant to go up next. We prioritise people who haven’t had their first turn yet, so everyone gets a chance. But I needed him to explain this.\n\nOnce he had a beer in hand, I gestured him over. He seemed to expect this and walked over immediately. “You’re up next… Dis. You want to do a song called uhhh… whatever this is? And there’s a band actually called this?” I asked curiously.\n\n“Yes, and you have to type it out exactly as I have written it down, or it won’t show up in the search results,” he replied matter-of-factly. “By the way, these are lower case L’s, not capital I’s or number 1’s.”\n\nOddly specific, I thought as I took extra care to spell every nonsense word exactly as he had written. I did make a mistake the first time, ending up with no search results except “you might also like this” videos in the suggestions. He graciously corrected that I should have typed “cbvmntprq” instead of “cbvmntpqr”.\n\nAnd there it was - only one search result. Even the suggestions were gone. The title of the video was written in some kind of script that I didn’t recognise at all. I studied linguistics at university, so I could recognise many different writing systems - even very uncommon ones - but this was something I’d never seen before. You know those “cursed text” memes where writing is generated to look glitched and incomprehensible? That’s the closest example I could think of, but it wasn’t that either.\n\nI pointed at the screen. “This one?”\n\nDis nodded. I announced his turn on the mic as he made his way to the stage. But before he did so, he had one last request for me. “Make sure you stay in the box. Don’t come out until my song’s done.”\n\nHuh, a little weird but okay. By the way, we host from a boxed-in area that we have to step in and out of with a deck around us, kind of like a DJ’s booth. Anyway, his requests would probably have freaked me out more if his voice wasn’t so soothing. I felt comforted despite it all. I wondered what his singing voice would sound like.\n\nAt this point, the indoor space of the club was quite empty as most attendees were congregated outside smoking and socialising. The few people inside weren’t paying the singers much mind - chatting amongst themselves, cuddling their partners, ordering drinks, scrolling on their phones. That quickly changed once Dis began his performance.\n\nMy confusion only increased once I hit play. The instrumentals formed a lush, sweeping pad that didn’t follow the rules of tones and semitones like the majority of western music. Sure, plenty of cultures around the world don’t subscribe to the rigid confines of western music theory; however the chords and tonal shifts did not just sound unfamiliar, but inexplicable; as though they were not meant to be processed by the human mind.\n\nAs soon as the music began, I could feel the air in the club change. The people going about their own business perked up and stared at the stage, a look of intrigue on each of their faces. People started walking inside, almost as if drawn by some magnetic force.\n\nI looked at Dis. Under the bright light of the stage, I could finally see what his tattoo was. A human body, with a pentagram wrapped around - though the lines making up the pentagram weren’t perfectly straight. They were wriggly - like they were ropes, or worms.\n\nAnd the words that escaped his lips - if you could call them words. I don’t know how to describe it better, but there were consonants I’d never heard before. Vowels I’d never heard before. Sounds that no human could plausibly pronounce - forget that, sounds that human ears should not be capable of registering. Sounds that should not exist in this universe.\n\nI wanted to get out, but I remembered him telling me to stay in the box. More and more people poured into the club, each of them transfixed by Dis. Their individual personalities gone from their faces, all staring at the stage with the same mesmerised expression. Hypnotised. Possessed, even.\n\nThen the music started “rising” for lack of a better word. The “sounds” that Dis “sang” intensified.\n\nAnd people began clawing at their stomachs.\n\nI don’t remember when the first splatters of blood began, but soon enough the floor was covered. They splashed onto the walls. Smeared onto the sides of the host’s box I stood in. A few drops got onto my skin and clothes.\n\nI had to get out now. But I could no longer move. It was as if a force field was keeping me still. I felt like screaming, but I couldn’t make a sound. I felt as though I should be nauseous, but nausea could no longer physically arise within me.\n\nI could only watch and listen. Dis continued pronouncing the unpronounceable, against the instrumental that was an auditory impossibility. And the audience kept going, no cries or facial expressions of pain. As if what they were doing was a normal routine.\n\nOne by one they tore through their abdominal muscles. I didn’t know it was possible for humans to have the strength to do so - or it wasn’t, because whatever was happening was unquestionably supernatural. One by one they ripped out their intestines - and began entangling their own guts around themselves. Gradually, they began to form shapes.\n\nPentagrams. Like the tattoo on the singer’s forearm.\n\nAs the “song” came to a conclusion, the entire crowd collapsed into a heap. The faces above their horrifically mangled bodies wrapped in five-point stars looked satisfied and serene.\n\nI fell to my knees, my head rested against the deck next to a still thick pile of song requests. His footsteps came over. I didn’t want to speak, yet I had so many questions.\n\nWho is Dis?\n\nThe phrase no longer amused me.\n\nAs I sensed his gaze over me, I had no choice but to ask through trembling breaths.\n\n“Who… are you?”\n\n“I am Dis. **Dis Pater**.”\n\n“And why… why did you spare me?”\n\n“Because I’ve been looking for the right one to work with me - and it’s you.”"},"69":{"title":"My therapist said he keeps a copy of every client’s house key","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdreds\/my_therapist_said_he_keeps_a_copy_of_every\/","flair":null,"author":"ezekiel_h_graves","selftext":"I’m writing this because I need to get it out. I don’t know what this is, exactly — a warning? A record? Proof I still exist?\n\nMaybe just a way to convince myself I’m not losing my mind. Because that’s how it works, right? That’s how they get in. Not with violence. Not with knives. With questions. With the slow unravelling of things you *thought* were solid.\n\nI started therapy a while back after a rough breakup. Classic stuff — panic attacks, shame spirals, waking up at 3 a.m. convinced no one would ever love me again. Dr. N was recommended by a friend. Said he was calm, “unusually perceptive.” That turned out to be true — *too* true.\n\nHe looked the part: mid-40s, soft voice, kind eyes, beard like a high school philosophy teacher. The office was beige and quiet, just a ticking clock and that faint smell of something herbal — not flowers, something older. Something you’d find in a drawer that hadn’t been opened in decades.\n\nAt first, he was exactly what I needed. He never interrupted. Never pushed. Just asked the right questions at the right time. A few sessions in, I was telling him things I hadn’t told anyone. Things I hadn’t even formed into *words* before.\n\nThat’s what makes this so hard. He didn’t feel dangerous. He felt *safe*.\n\nUntil one day, he didn’t.\n\nIt was session fourteen. I remember because I’d just started to feel like I was making progress. We were talking about my fear of home invasion — not just the fear, but the rituals. Triple-checking locks. Leaving the hallway light on. Sleeping with a flashlight under my pillow.\n\nHe smiled and said, “You know, I keep a copy of every client’s house key.”\n\nHe said it lightly. Like a joke.\n\nI stared at him.\n\nHe smiled again. “Just kidding.”\n\nBut there was a pause after that — the kind of silence that doesn’t land right. Like he was watching to see how much I believed him.\n\nI laughed awkwardly. Said something like, “Guess I better start locking the windows, too.”  \nHe didn’t reply. Just wrote something down for the first time ever in our sessions.\n\nI should’ve walked away then.\n\nOver the next few weeks, little things started happening at home.\n\nAt first, I thought I was just being forgetful. I’d come home and my shampoo bottle would be in the wrong place — not fallen, just rotated. The lid unscrewed a little. Once, my toothbrush was damp at 3 p.m. I hadn’t been home since morning.\n\nAnother time, the fridge door was open just a crack. Nothing missing. Nothing spoiled. Just... open.\n\nIt never escalated. Nothing loud. Nothing obvious. Just *wrongness* in the small details.\n\nI started testing it. Taped a single hair across the crack of my bedroom door. Sprinkled talcum powder by the entryway. Left a glass of water on the counter and measured the meniscus. I didn’t tell anyone — not even Dr. N. I wanted to be sure.\n\nThe hair would be gone.  \nThe powder scuffed.  \nThe water level — lower, by millimetres.\n\nSo I changed the locks. Bought a triple deadbolt system, self-installed. Didn’t tell my landlord. Didn’t write it down. Didn’t even mention it aloud in my apartment.\n\nNext session, he smiled and said, “Feeling safer at home now?”\n\nThat was the last time I saw him.\n\nI stopped showing up. Ignored his calls. Blocked the clinic number. I thought I was done.\n\nBut a week later, he emailed me.\n\n**“Noticed you’ve been distant. Just checking that you’re safe at home.”**\n\nThere it was again — that phrase. *Safe at home.*\n\nI moved the next month. New suburb. New number. Didn’t tell friends the address. Scrubbed myself off every online listing I could find. Bought blackout curtains and a door jammer. I even covered the peephole with tape.\n\nIt worked. For a while.\n\nThen yesterday, I checked my letterbox.\n\nInside was a plain white envelope. No name, no stamp, no return address. Just my unit number in block letters. My *new* unit number. One I never gave out.\n\nInside the envelope was a single key — my key.  \nTaped to a sheet of blank paper.  \nAnd written underneath, in tiny, careful handwriting:\n\n***You forgot to give me your spare.***\n\nI haven’t gone to the police. What would I even say?\n\n*“My ex-therapist mailed me my own key and I’m scared he exists?”*\n\nThey’d ask how he got the address. I wouldn’t have an answer.  \nThey’d ask for proof. I don’t have any.  \nThey’d ask if I was still taking my medication.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point.\n\nBecause I think this was never about therapy.  \nIt was about access.  \nConditioning.  \nCompliance.\n\nI thought the sessions were for healing, but now I think they were rehearsals.  \nEvery question was a prompt.  \nEvery silence was a test.  \nEvery “joke” was a blueprint.\n\nAnd when I stopped showing up, it didn’t stop him.  \nIt *activated* him.\n\nSince the envelope arrived, small things have started again.\n\nThe blinds shift positions.  \nA spoon I never use ends up in the sink.  \nMy razor is slightly damp in the morning.  \nOnce, I woke up and the light in the *closet* was on. I haven’t opened that door in weeks.\n\nLast night, I was going through my drawer and found something that wasn’t mine.  \nA folded piece of paper between receipts and expired coupons.\n\nIt was a printout of my original intake form from last year.  \nDate-stamped. Signed. My handwriting.  \nBut under the notes section, in red pen, was something new:\n\n**Client Case File #0042 — Complete Acquisition.**  \n**Progress: 92%.**  \n**DO NOT INTERRUPT CYCLE.**\n\nAnd then, scribbled beneath it in shaky black ink — my own handwriting, but… wrong, like I’d written it in a dream:\n\n***I consent.***\n\nThat’s not how this ends.  \nIt’s how it was *meant* to end.\n\nI thought I escaped him.  \nBut now I think the only reason I still exist… is because he’s *not finished yet.*\n\nAnd tonight, as I write this, I just heard something in the hallway.\n\nNot a creak.  \nNot a thump.  \nA *click.*  \nDeliberate.  \nMechanical.  \nA key.\n\nTurning in the deadbolt."},"70":{"title":"I bought a telescope to watch the stars. One of them started moving impossibly every night, drawing the same shapes.

I need someone to know what i know , even if they won't believe me.\n\nI'm a normal guy, just like everyone else . My life is very ordinary: work, then home, maybe a bit too much solitude. The only thing that gives me a sense of comfort or escape from this monotony is the sky. Ever since I was a child, I've loved looking at the stars. It's a strange feeling, looking at things millions of light-years away, things our ancestors saw, and perhaps generations long after us will see. It makes you feel incredibly small, but also part of something immensely larger.\n\nAbout a year ago, I decided to take this interest to another level. I saved up and bought a telescope. Not exactly professional grade, but a decent one. It magnifies the view and lets me see more details on the moon, nearby planets, and sometimes distant star clusters or faint nebulae if the sky is clear. Most nights, I go up to our building's rooftop, as far away from the street noise and city lights as I can manage. I sit there for hours, in the quiet of the night, the sound of the cool breeze, just focused on the telescope's eyepiece. The whole world disappears, leaving only me and the tiny point of light I'm observing.\n\nMany nights passed in the same routine. I'd align the telescope to a specific region of the sky and just contemplate. Sometimes I'd look at Jupiter and its faint rings, other times at Mars with its distinct red hue, and often I'd just get lost in the endless sea of stars. I used to feel a strange peace, a peace I couldn't find anywhere else.\n\nUntil one night, about two months ago. That night changed everything.\n\nI was on the rooftop as usual. The weather was nice, the sky relatively clear. I had an eyepiece attached that gave me a slightly wider field of view, wanting to scan an area dense with stars. As I slowly moved the telescope, I noticed something odd. A point of light, like an ordinary star, but... it wasn't stationary.\n\nAt first, I thought maybe my hand had shaken, or perhaps it was a very distant aircraft. I focused harder. No, not an airplane. Airplanes follow straight or gently curved paths, and they have blinking lights. This was a steady point of light, just like a star, but it was moving. And it wasn't moving like the satellites we sometimes see crossing the sky at a constant speed in a straight line. No, this thing was moving in a way that was... impossible.\n\nIt was making sharp, acute angles, stopping abruptly, then shooting off in another direction at high speed, only to slow down again and trace something like... a strange geometric shape. Initially, I thought I might be hallucinating, maybe my eyes were strained from focusing too long. I pulled my eye away from the eyepiece, looked up at the sky directly. Of course, I saw nothing but the familiar, fixed stars. I returned to the telescope, aimed it at the same region. There it was! Still there, still moving in that same crazy manner.\n\nMy heart started beating faster. What was this? A spy satellite? But what kind of satellite performs these kinds of aerobatics? A drone? What drone could reach that altitude and appear like a star? My mind raced, searching for any logical explanation, anything to hold onto. I found nothing.\n\nI kept tracking it with my eye and the telescope for about an hour. It was tracing bizarre shapes in a small patch of the sky. Complex patterns, like intersecting lines, curves, and sharp angles, then suddenly it would vanish or move so fast I'd lose it.\n\nI came down from the rooftop feeling a mixture of shock, anxiety, and intense curiosity. I didn't know what I had just seen. I spent the whole night thinking. Could it be a rare optical phenomenon? A specific light reflection? A problem with the telescope itself? But the telescope worked perfectly fine with all the other stars and planets. And this phenomenon was very specific, localized to that single point.\n\nThe next day, I went up to the rooftop a bit earlier, before the time I'd seen the phenomenon. I was tense, expectant. Same area of the sky, same telescope settings. And indeed, at roughly the same time, it appeared again. The same point of light, the same impossible movements. This time, I was more focused. I tried to follow its path meticulously. It was tracing the exact same shapes I had seen the night before! Not similar shapes, no, precisely the same ones! The same angles, the same pauses, the same speeds.\n\nThis is where it went beyond coincidence or natural phenomena, or even a conventional satellite. Something tracing the same complex pattern every night, in the same spot, at the same time? This wasn't natural. This was... intentional.\n\nA faint sense of dread started creeping into me. The idea of \"aliens\" or \"UFOs\" had always been just science fiction and movies to me. I never seriously considered it. But what I was seeing had no earthly explanation I could logically arrive at. If it wasn't aliens in a craft... then what?\n\nThe third night, I went up armed with a notebook and pen. I started observing the point as it moved, trying my best to sketch the path it was taking. It was incredibly difficult; the movement was fast, the shapes complex, and my hand wasn't steady enough. But I was determined. I drew jagged lines, dots, angles, trying to capture any part of this pattern. Every night, I went up and drew. Every night, the same movements repeated with the same meticulous precision.\n\nI began comparing the drawings from different nights. The same sequence, the same strange geometric figures. It wasn't just movement anymore; it felt more like a message being written across the sky. But a message from whom? And why? And what did it mean?\n\nThe first week passed like this. I became obsessed. My work started to suffer, my sleep dwindled. During the day, I'd think about what I saw at night, and at night, I was perched on the rooftop, fixated on that moving point of light. I started feeling utterly alone in the world, holding a secret nobody knew, and nobody would likely believe if I told them.\n\nI considered telling a friend once. We were sitting at a café, and I was very hesitant. Finally, I vaguely hinted that I was seeing strange things in the sky with my telescope. He looked at me and said, \"Man, you must be seeing things, maybe it's just a plane or a satellite and you're making a big deal out of it.\" I tried to explain that the movement wasn't normal, that it repeated, but he just laughed and said, \"Alright man, next time film it and show us.\"\n\nThe idea of filming it had occurred to me, of course. I tried recording with my phone camera through the telescope eyepiece. But the image came out extremely shaky and unclear, and the point of light was so small it barely showed up as a pixel or two moving erratically in the video. There was no solid physical proof I could present. I went back to the notebook and pen.\n\nEvery night, I added a new piece to the drawing, like assembling a large, complex puzzle. I started noticing that these shapes weren't just random lines. There was repetition, a certain symmetry. Like a strange visual language. I would stare at these drawings for hours, trying to understand them. Was it a map? Chemical symbols? The design for some machine?\n\nTime passed, and I still didn't understand anything. The feeling of helplessness grew. I was witnessing something happening right before my eyes every night, something that could potentially be the most important discovery in human history, and I couldn't comprehend it or report it to anyone convincingly. The fear began to evolve. It wasn't just fear of the unknown anymore; it became fear of what this message might actually be saying. If it was a message, who was sending it with such power that it barely appeared as a moving star? And what level of importance or danger would warrant such an effort?\n\nI started searching online for anything similar. Amateur astronomy forums, conspiracy theory websites, anything. I found no description matching what I was seeing. Everything was either mundane sightings of satellites or planes, or clearly fabricated videos. What I was seeing was different. It was real, persistent, and terrifyingly organized.\n\nOver time, the drawing in my notebook started to take shape. I now had a complete sequence of the movements the point made over about an hour and a half each night. An incredibly complex drawing, filled with minute details. I'd look at it, feeling like the key was right in front of me, but I couldn't find the door.\n\nOne night, as I was looking at the drawing, comparing it to the previous night's to ensure accuracy, I noticed something. In a specific part of the drawing, there seemed to be... a certain ratio that repeated between the lengths of particular lines and specific angles. A mathematical ratio. Something like the Golden Ratio, perhaps, but much more complex.\n\nI thought to myself, \"Wait a minute... what if these aren't visual symbols in the traditional sense? What if they're... equations? What if it's the language of mathematics?\"\n\nThey call mathematics the language of the universe. Maybe whoever is sending this message knows that the only way to communicate with any other civilization, regardless of their language or form, is through mathematical constants and logic.\n\nThis idea sent a shiver down my spine. If this was math, then I needed someone who understood highly complex mathematics to decipher it. My education is average; my highest level of math was in high school. But this idea opened a new door.\n\nI began focusing on the drawing from a mathematical perspective. Looking for numerical patterns, for known constants like Pi (π) or Euler's number (e). It was like trying to crack an impossible code. I spent days and nights trying to apply the simple math I knew, searching online for advanced mathematical concepts that might relate to these shapes. Chaos Theory, Fractal Geometry – things I'd never even heard of before.\n\nI felt like a blind person feeling their way through a dark maze. Every time I felt I was getting close to something, I'd hit a dead end. But I didn't give up. The feeling that the answer was near, that this message had meaning, was stronger than any frustration.\n\nTo avoid suspicion or questions about the source of these shapes, I started using a tactic. I joined specialized math forums online, presenting small fragments of the drawing as \"abstract mathematical problems\" or \"geometric puzzles\" I was trying to solve as a hobby. I framed them in a context completely removed from astronomy or anything unusual.\n\nThe reactions were mixed. Many people said they were just meaningless scribbles with no clear mathematical significance. Others tried to find patterns but arrived at illogical conclusions. However, a small minority, likely academics or people deeply versed in pure mathematics, were intrigued by the complexity and symmetry in these shapes. They began discussing hypotheses, talking about the possibility that they represented a specific type of complex mathematical function or an unconventional mathematical system.\n\nI followed these discussions eagerly, gathering any information, any thread that might lead me somewhere. I started understanding new terminology, learning about branches of mathematics I didn't know existed. And I began applying these ideas to the complete drawing I possessed.\n\nSlowly, gradually, the picture began to clear. It wasn't just a single equation; it was a series of interconnected mathematical equations and concepts, layered on top of each other. Each part of the drawing represented a variable, a constant, or a specific calculation. It was a purely mathematical language, completely abstract, devoid of any form of spoken or written language we know.\n\nI spent several more weeks on this painstaking work. Connecting the parts, trying to find the logic governing the sequence. It felt like solving the hardest equation of my life. And the closer I got to the solution, the more the fear inside me grew. Because I started sensing the nature of the message. It wasn't a message of welcome, nor a map to a cosmic treasure, nor the design for a devastating weapon. It carried a sense of urgency... and of pain.\n\nUntil I reached the crucial moment. After long nights of sleeplessness, concentration, and calculations (aided by online tools and the discussions on the specialized forums I interacted with very cautiously), I managed to piece it all together. I was able to \"translate\" this mathematical message into a concept that we humans could grasp.\n\nThe result... was simpler and more horrifying than anything I could have possibly imagined.\n\nThe message wasn't coming from a spacecraft orbiting this star. Nor from a civilization living on a planet orbiting it.\n\nThe message was coming from the star itself.\n\nI don't understand how, and I don't know if this is scientifically possible or not. Can stars possess consciousness? Can they be living beings in a way completely different from our understanding of life? I don't know, and that's not the important part right now. What matters is the content of the message.\n\nAll those complex geometric shapes and impossible movements, when translated from the abstract, universal language of mathematics, conveyed one simple, terrifying meaning – a meaning understandable to any living being anywhere in the universe that might have reached a certain level of understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and mathematics.\n\nThe equations described a specific physical state... a state of rapid, unexpected internal collapse. A state of imminent stellar death.\n\nAnd the final message, the culmination of all these movements, was the mathematical equivalent of a simple phrase composed of two core concepts:\n\n\"Help request.\"\n\"Imminent end \/ Death.\"\n\nOr simply, in human terms:\n\n\"Help us. We are dying.\"\n\nI sat there, staring at the notebook, at the final equation, frozen in place. Unable to move, unable to think. The coldness I felt in that moment wasn't from the rooftop air; it came from the depths of the cosmos itself.\n\nA dying star. A conscious star, or at least one capable of communication somehow, sending a distress call across the vast expanse of space. A plea written in the language of mathematics so that anyone might understand it.\n\nAnd that someone... was me. An ordinary young man sitting on a rooftop in a distant country, with a modest telescope. I was the one who cracked the code. I was the one who heard the scream.\n\nA scream that had been traveling for how many light-years to reach here? Tens? Hundreds? Thousands? Millions? Where exactly is this star? Is it even still there, or is this just an echo of a voice that died long, long ago?\n\nAnd what could I possibly do? Who am I to help a dying star? What help could I offer? Even if I knew its exact location, even if I notified every space agency in the world, what would they do? Send a spaceship that would take millions of years to arrive? And if it arrived, what could it possibly do?\n\nThe sense of absolute helplessness was crushing. The feeling of cosmic loneliness became deeper, more terrifying. We aren't just small in this universe; we are also frighteningly powerless. We hear the cries for help from our cosmic neighbors, and we can do absolutely nothing.\n\nThat night, after deciphering the code, I went back up to the rooftop. I pointed the telescope at the same spot. The point of light was still there. Still tracing the same complex geometric shapes in the cold silence of space. Still sending the same desperate message.\n\n\"Help us. We are dying.\"\n\nThis time, I wasn't looking at it with curiosity or fear of the unknown. I was looking at it with profound sadness, and a terrible sense of guilt. I knew. I understood. And I could do nothing.\n\nThe sky, where I used to find peace and escape, had transformed for me into a vast graveyard filled with stars dying in silence, or screaming pleas for help that no one hears, or those who hear cannot answer.\n\nEvery night now, I go up to the rooftop. Not to enjoy the stars, but because... I honestly don't know why. Maybe to bear witness. Maybe so that this scream doesn't just echo into the void completely alone. I sit and watch this point as it draws its message of death, knowing that a real star, a massive entity perhaps the size of our sun or larger, is collapsing and crying for help somewhere far away in the darkness.\n\nThe biggest problem is that a realization like this changes everything. How can I go back to living my ordinary life knowing what I know? How can I care about trivial problems of work, money, and relationships, when I know that beings the size of stars are pleading for help in the universe around us?\n\n\nI still go up to the rooftop every night. And the point of light still traces the same pattern. The same equation. The same scream.\n\n\"Help us. We are dying.\"\n\nAnd I don't know what to do. And I don't know if there's anyone else, anywhere else in this universe, seeing the same message, and feeling the same helplessness that I feel right now.\n\nJust the thought that this message might be traced across the skies of other planets, before the eyes of other beings, each one standing alone, as helpless as I am... that thought makes me want to scream.\n\nBut I hold it in. And I just keep watching in silence. Maybe that's all I can do."},"71":{"title":"Our first date started in a mall.

Are we ready?” Rav stood right beside me, armed with his trusty Smith & Wesson. Professor Ed pulled the cap off his marker, and approached the whiteboard. \n\n“Inputting Solution.” \n\nThere was a small patch of blank real estate on the whiteboard beneath a totally crowded sea of carefully written mathematics. Prof Ed leaned in and completed the bottom-most set of symbols by drawing the final ‘X’.\n\n**∮ e\\^(iπθ) · d𝛻 = -λ · Δχ**\n\nThere came that little reverberation in the air. \n\nThe entire whiteboard shimmered.\n\nThen, like a mirror reflection, *ANOTHER* Prof Ed showed up right beside the original.\n\nThe equation had worked. There were now two Eds. They both stared at each other. And then at us.\n\n“Are you okay?” Asked Rav.\n\n“ Yes,” Ed said. “ I feel intact.”\n\nRav and I scanned the entire *Bass Pro Shop* for any sort of disturbances. The fishing aisle, clothing aisle, and entire front of the store were all quiet. We listened for anything beyond our breathing. All seemed to be clear.\n\nThe original Ed held the shoulder of his new duplicate.\n\n“Senses?” Rav asked.\n\n“Sight: good.” Prof Ed squinted. “Hearing: good. “\n\nProf Ed leaned into his bag and pulled out an apple. He passed the apple to his duplicate, who held it firmly. “Touch: good. Smell: good.”\n\nDupe Ed took a bite and then spoked in-between chews. “Taste: good.”\n\nI exhaled. *Everything seems to have worked.*\n\n I carefully put the shotgun in the case beside me and happily locked it away. Then I picked up our iPad and ran through *Group C’s duplication checklist*.\n\n“Okay this assessment is for Duplicate Ed. First question: Where are we?”\n\nDupe Ed smiled and answered. “A plane of space-time adjacent to our own. Inside a mall. We aren’t sure if its infinitely generative or idempotent”\n\n“What's the number we told original Ed before duplication?”\n\n“69-420”\n\nRav gave a small chuckle.\n\n“Close your eyes and try to touch the other Ed’s hand.”\n\nThe checklist went on like this for a while, we had to be sure Ed’s shiny new duplicate wasn’t defective in some way. After ten minutes of carefully chosen queries, we could see that the duplicate was cooperative, receptive and healthy. A perfect replica of Ed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe named the duplicate *Edward*, to differentiate him from Professor Ed. \n\nEdward swapped his duplicate corduroy pants and dress shirt for some brownish-green fatigues (from *Bass Pro’s* Spring selection). He gave us a dorky salute when he came out of the changeroom.\n\nIt was really strange seeing Prof Ed’s mannerisms completely copied by this new mirror version, down to the way he adjusted his glasses and walked favoring his left leg.\n\n“Interesting, interesting… It’s exactly like Group C said,” Prof Ed stroked his goatee. “It feels like my consciousness is spread upon two bodies. Not divided, but *doubled*. Each of my selves is capable of acting independently, and yet both still share the same memories and skills. It's almost like I am the thoughts of two people.”\n\n“So you would describe it as *thinking* like two people now?” Rav asked.\n\nProf Ed put his fingers on both his temples. ‘Yes. It’s like I have two brains.” \n\nEdward also held his temples. \n\nAs if performing a magic show, both Eds spoke in perfect unison. “When I conjoin both minds to think on the same subject, everything works faster. My mental ability feels much higher.”\n\nRav raised his brow. He pulled out the iPad and did a quick calculation. “What is the root of 169 multiplied by 150?”\n\n“1,950” both Eds spoke at once.\n\nRav and I stared at each other. *Holy nuts.*\n\nProf Ed went up to the busy whiteboard, admiring the math. “I now understand how Group C was able to perfect the duplication equation. With a double-mind, this all clicks immediately.”\n\nEven though I had no conception of math, I could certainly tell that Ed had gotten smarter. His pronunciation was *crisper* too (maybe because he could more literally hear himself speak from another set of ears).\n\nWe asked plenty of questions to both Eds, and they gave us straight answers.\n\n We probably could have stayed the whole day poking and prodding this reality-defying marvel, but eventually we had to keep moving. \n\nFood supplies were running low, and the mall wasn’t going to explore itself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere was a slight debate over whether or not we should arm Edward too. Something about the consciousness of Ed now controlling two selves, each with a gun, seemed a little alarming to Rav and I. But then Edward brought up a counterpoint.  \n\n“I think if we ever split up, it would be useful for both of my selves to have a gun.”\n\n“Split up? But we can’t do that,” I said. “It’s dangerous enough as it is.”\n\n“What I mean to say is—” Edward pointed to himself,“—what if only *I* split away?” \n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“We could be doubling our efficiency.” Edward tapped the floor. “A single me can explore the floor below us, while the main group continues above.\n\nRav holstered his revolver. “You're not afraid of travelling … alone?”\n\nEdward laughed nervously. “I mean yes, I anticipate being a little scared travelling apart, but also in quite a literal sense, I won’t be apart. I’ll still be talking to both of you on the main floor.”\n\nWe looked at both of the Eds a little confused.\n\n“Here, watch this. I’m having a conversation with you, feeling supported by your presence…” Edward walked away, down the aisle, out the front of the store, stepping totally out of earshot.\n\nProf Ed turned to us and continued speaking. “… And now I’m still chatting with you still, keeping my morale high and exploring a whole new section of the mall. Seems pretty useful right?”\n\n“Oh I see.” Rav said. He scratched the back of his head. “I mean. If you’re comfortable doing that. That *does* seem wise. To divide and conquer a little.”\n\n“I think it's the way to go.” Prof Ed said. “We’ll find food faster, and maybe some hints about the mall’s deterioration.”\n\nRav and I both nodded. Thanks to Edward’s willingness, we’d be starting to map the floorplan beneath us too. That felt too useful to pass up.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Alright, this looks like our stop.” \n\nOur flashlights lit up the edge of some glass railings, which framed  the black, shiny handrails of a completely functioning escalator.\n\n A single escalator that *only went down*.\n\nWe shined over the railings with our flashlights, but none of them were strong enough to illuminate any detail in the complete blackness below.\n\n*Wherever that lower floor was, it was fucking far, far down,* I thought.\n\n“If you do feel overwhelmed you can always come back up to us at any time.” Rav patted Edward’s shoulder.\n\n“I’ll be safe,” Edward adjusted his headlamp. “Don't worry, I think as long as Prof Ed is with you guys, I’ll be able to manage myself below.”\n\nEdward gave a goofy, but still semi-serious salute, as he stepped onto the first moving step. You could tell he kind of liked being an adventurer. It went well with his full camo outfit and rifle. \n\n“Hunt a turkey for us while you’re down there.” I joked .\n\nEdward laughed. “I will for sure. Stay vigilant and I’ll see you when I find another way up!”\n\nHe waved as the metal stairs drifted him down, deeper and deeper into the darkness. His flashlight whipped back and forth along the escalator, not illuminating much. Then, very abruptly, the light disappeared.\n\nBoth Rav and I watched Prof Ed’s face widen, reacting to whatever Edward was seeing.\n\n“It goes straight into a sort of tunnel,” Prof Ed said. \n\n“The escalator?”\n\n“Yes. I can see ads hung inside the walls. “Gillette Razors. Marlboro cigarettes.”\n\n“...Cigarettes?”\n\n“Yeah there's an older feel to the interior design. Lots of neon colored vinyl on the wall. Pink and powder blue.”\n\nWe watched as Prof Ed closed his eyes and excitedly described what Edwin was seeing. “Oh and now I’ve reached it. The floor below. \n\n“How does it look?” \n\nProf Ed stroked his beard. “It's still part of a mall, but a little different. It feels more colorful in terms of its aesthetics, you know?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Like I see the supporting pillars around me with kind of a blue brush stroke swish on them. You know *jazz cup*? It looks like *jazz cup.”*\n\nI nodded knowingly. My older brother was a child of the 80s. He still wore his purple and teal wind-breaker from time to time.\n\n“So it's an *80s mall* down there?”\n\n“Yes! That is exactly what it feels like.” Prof Ed opened his eyes and looked at us. “I see an *Esprit* casual wear store, and I see a *Swatch* shop. You guys remember *Swatch* watches?”\n\nWe laughed and asked him to grab us a couple. \n\nIt appeared that the mall level Edward had stumbled in was from an older era.  Which was interesting because the main floor was pretty much an extension of the more modern mid-2000s *City Center Mall* we first entered.\n\n“Perhaps you can stumble into older timelines,  the deeper down you go?” Rav wondered.\n\n“Its possible, I’ll let you know if Edward sees any other stairs.” Prof Ed turned away from the escalator, turned on his flashlight.  “Alright, let's continue ourselves.  ’ll give updates on Edward as we go.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe mall for us was the usual level of creepy. No lights. Lots of long hallways. Glass storefronts everywhere.\n\nWe passed by a luxury goods section of the mall. Lots of *Tiffany's, Pandora and Swarovski.* There was always a little klepto in me who wanted to steal as much as the jewelry as possible.\n\n(But I’m already carrying something like ten $50,000 necklaces at the bottom of my bag from when we pilfered a *BVLGARI* store so I really didn’t need more…)\n\nOur flashlights made the diamonds on display glisten, throwing hundreds of tiny rays of light everywhere. It seemed to inspire Prof Ed.\n\n“Should we keep duplicating me each time we stop to reset? What do you guys think?”\n\nRav and I slowed our steps. “Huh?”\n\n“Like maybe it makes sense to just send an army of me to scour the mall to find an exit faster.”\n\nRav shook his head, “but the more of you we make, the more mouths we have to feed. And food has been pretty rare lately…”\n\nProf Ed stopped in his tracks. “Oh. I didn't think about that.”\n\nI felt my own stomach grumble.\n\nProf Ed closed his eyes and held the bridge of his nose for a second. “However, I am starting to understand how Indrek was able to find a solution for Gödel's theorem.  Since he has hundreds of duplicates, his intellect must be *transcendent.* Probably over 1,000 IQ.”\n\n“Are you saying, you don’t care if your copies get hungry? As long as you have more?” Rav asked.\n\n“Well if we copy more of me, I’ll be able to process *a lot* of complex thoughts at once. It's possible I could think of an exit formula...”\n\n“Hold up,” I said.  I didn't like where this was going. I might not have been a mathematician, but I *was* a philosophy major.\n\n“If we duplicate Ed over and over, to try and understand why Indrek is evil, it is entirely possible that Ed’s consciousness will *become as evil as Indrek’s.”*\n\nBoth of them looked at me confused.\n\n“I mean, think about it. Maybe having your consciousness multiplied between a thousand copies of yourself, maybe *that* is what turns you into a megalomaniac. Maybe that's what made Indrek trap us in this mall.”\n\nProf Ed stroked his beard, then pointed at me. “You are totally right. That is a very valid concern.”\n\n“And that’s why we keep our dupe limit to one per person.” Rav gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n*Oh did I say something smart?* I smiled. \n\n“The most pressing concern is food though, you guys are right about—”\n\n“—Fooood!” Prof Ed stopped at the edge of the last jewelry store.  “Edward found a *McDonald’s!”*\n\nBoth Rav and I stared at Ed’s face. His eyes were glazed over, seeing something we weren't.\n\n “Oh boy. Not only is there food at this *McDonald's*, but there's also something else. We've got to check it out.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Eds used their mind link to find a spiral staircase which would allow us to all meet at the 80s floor. I didn't like the idea of descending into a deeper level of the **infinite mall**, but it had to be done.\n\nIt was a fire escape. The ugly, concrete kind that you would normally take to reach the parkade. It took us six minutes of descending around tight, claustrophobic corners until we met Edward holding open a door.\n\n“Hey guys, long time no see. Welcome to the 80s.”\n\nWe walked out to a plaza surrounded with fake ferns and palm trees. There was a small kiosk in between the plants with cursive pink lettering that read *Food Court.*\n\nWe followed Edward’s lead as he took us towards those iconic golden arches. But they weren't the usual arches… the capital ‘M’ looked like a smushed squiggle above the word ‘*McDnlds’.*\n\n“Oh wow. It looks so off.” Rav said.\n\n“Rendered with many errors.” Edward nodded.\n\nIt was an 80s *MacDonald's* alright, but the menu was indecipherable. The words were all blots.\n\n“Holy shit,” I said, pointing at the customer seating area, it looked like it stretched out forever. My flashlight couldn't find a back wall. “Is this *MacDonald's* enormous?”\n\n“It looks to be way bigger than a regular *MacDonald's* yes,” Edward confirmed. “There appears to be a bit of spatial stretching. Follow me, I’ll show you.”\n\nWe walked down the long hallway. At the very end, the last set of customer tables was a crack in the wall.\n\n“The fissure is right here, “ Edward pointed.\n\nThere was a thin silvery liquid dripping out from a crack. The quicksilver oozed down the wallpaper and onto the floor.\n\n“What is that?” Rav asked.\n\n“*Non-matter*,” Professor Ed said, standing behind all of us. “The silver goop is raw, unrendered material that the mall has not configured yet.”\n\nRav and I stared, our flashlights brightening the ooze.\n\n“It’s a deterioration,” Edward said. “A glitch in the mall’s algorithm. It's very possible that behind this wall we could find some kind of exit.”\n\n“You really think so?” I said.\n\n“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Rav held out his hands. “Let’s eat first before we start playing with so-called *non-matter.”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe deep-fryers were still working, and there were plenty of frozen burgers and potatoes. Shamelessly, we all ate about two cheeseburgers, as well as a mountain of fries. \n\nEdward held a spatula and tested it for durability. “I say we try to wedge an opening. I’ll go inside.”\n\nRav almost choked on his burger. “You want to go *inside* the non-matter?”\n\n“Why not?” Edward shrugged. “If we can make the crack wide enough, I can step a foot inside and tell you what I see. There are two of me after all.”\n\nI scraped a fry through some ketchup. “How does pain work between you two? If one Ed touches a stove, do you both feel it?”\n\n“Oh absolutely,” Edward chuckled, then pinched his own arm. \n\nIt made Prof Ed wince. “Ouch.”\n\n“We share each other's nervous systems, so we both feel the other’s sensations.” Edward swapped his spatula for a broom. “But regardless of the risk, I think it's important that I go in there and see what I can find.” \n\nRav and I both asked why he was so willing. It was such a dangerous feat.\n\nEdward’s face turned solemn. “Clayton, my own student, lost his life for us trying to find an exit. I feel responsible for not saving him. This way I can help us all.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe gathered around the crack with the longest pole-like objects we could find. The idea was to see if we could pry it open with leverage.\n\nEdward started by poking the fissure with a broom, handle-first. When he had inserted the boom halfway through, he applied pressure onto one side.\n\n“It’s working,”  Prof Ed said. “The wall is splitting”\n\nIndeed, I could see the point of entry for the broom get a little wider with each of Edward’s wiggles. The crack split further down the wall until it reached the floor.  Lots of silver liquid was pouring out.\n\n“Woah. Is that stuff alive?” Rav pointed. \n\nThe silver liquid clumped together on the floor, forming a growing mass. In about a half a minute, the ooze started to hover.\n\n“Holy crap. Is that floating?” \n\nThe ooze conjoined to form a floating, mirror-like sphere. It was about the size of a yoga ball. \n\nMore silver droplets continued to leak out of the crack, accruing at the sphere’s back.\n\n“Interesting, interesting,” Prof Ed said. He grabbed his mop and gently tried to poke the anomaly.\n\nThe orb engulfed the mop head, and then swallowed the whole mop inside with very faint *slurp.*\n\n“Wow. It ate my mop.”\n\nWe all backed away from the silver orb. I noticed I was suddenly retreating *uphill*. The checkerboard floor tiles beneath my feet warping into elongated shapes.\n\n*The space around us is stretching towards the orb.*\n\n“What is this thing?” I said. “Is it dangerous?”\n\n“A black hole?” Rav sounded worried.\n\nEdward stared at it with shining eyes. “I think it's some kind of indent. Like a *fold in spacetime.* I think it could be an Einstein-Rosen bridge.”\n\n“A what?” There was even a slight tug on my clothes in the direction of the orb.\n\n“A wormhole!” Prof Ed said. He looked ecstatic. “It's moving the space around us to somewhere else! This could be our ticket out of here!”\n\nEdward calmly tied a thick rope around his waist. He handed Rav the loose end. “I’m going in.”\n\nRav wrapped the rope around his knuckles. “You think this is a good idea?” \n\n“Yes.” Prof Ed grabbed the rope in front of Rav, “Edward will go. I will see what he sees. This is the only way we'll know for sure what’s inside.”\n\nI strapped my flashlight to my shoulder mount and grabbed the very end of the rope.\n\nThe mirror orb was hovering above Edward curiously. It bounced like a silver balloon, its fat back bumping along the ceiling, stretching the ceiling tiles into oblong shapes.\n\nEdward stepped directly beneath it. “Okay. I think it's now or never.”\n\nRav, Prof Ed, and I all braced ourselves. \n\nEdward took a couple steps back. “Three… two … one…”He ran forward, planted both feet, and leapt.\n\nThe surface of the orb came alive.\n\nLike living water.  \n\n*It was eager to accept him.*\n\nThe quicksilver wrapped its splashes around Edward’s back, absorbing him immediately and fully. Within seconds, the orb’s surface attenuated, and it now resembled a perfect sphere.\n\nThe three of us tugged on the rope as hard as we could, keeping it firmly taut. It's one end was being reeled inside the sphere.\n\n“Hold steady!” Rav yelled.\n\nFor a moment we held it in place. Nothing moved. \n\nAnd then Ed Let go. \n\n“AUUUUGH!!!!” Ed fell to his knees and grabbed his scalp.\n\n“GUUUUUUUUUUUUUEEAAAAGHH!!”\n\nRav and I picked up the slack. The sphere slowly started reeling us in.\n\n“Ed!? Are you okay!?” I asked. \n\nThe professor's eyes practically popped out of his sockets.  I had never seen a person in so much pain.\n\n“What’s in there Ed?” Rav grunted. \n\n“Ed talk to us!”\n\nEd started making a mewling, gagging sound. Like he was choking. He started crying *tears of blood.*\n\n“What’s going on man!”\n\nThe professor fell and convulsed on the floor. Legs and arms swung wildly without coordination. We watched his seizure roll him closer to the orb.\n\n“Fuck!”\n\nThe tug-of-war was unwinnable. The sphere was sucking in the rope like a twelve-ton crank. \n\nI let go and grabbed hold of Ed’s legs. Rav followed suit and grabbed Ed’s arms. \n\n“MMMUGHHH!” Ed screamed out in the middle of his schism. His face looked unnaturally contorted. \n\n“IT’S CRUSHING ME! IT’S ALL CAVING IN!”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRav and I did our best to heave the Professor away from the menacing silver thing. The ball floated behind us, slurping up the rest of Edwin’s rope.\n\nWe had barely gotten moving when we collided with a wire mesh.\n\n“What the?”\n\nA *McDonald’s Play Place.* One of those indoor jungle gyms with a ball pit. Somehow it was now in front of us.\n\nRav and I looked around and saw that the floating orb had now divided into two.\n\n*Fucking great.*\n\nThe orbs were bending space around them. The only way through was via the *Play Place*.\n\n“Come on! Hurry!” I pulled at Ed’s feet.\n\nWe hauled the professor’s spasming body until we reached the edge of the ball pit.\n\n“Fuck. Do we just…?”\n\n“Through the pit!”\n\nWe both jumped into the ball pit and pulled Ed between us.\n\nThe two silver orbs approached us from two sides. \n\nAnd now the ball-pit was all we could see.\n\n“Oh God. No..”\n\nA ball-pit ocean expanded on all sides. Rav and I were in the middle of thousands of red, yellow and blue plastic balls for miles in each direction\n\n“Which way do we go!?”\n\nThe two orbs hovered above us, trailing ever so slightly behind our frantic ‘swimming’. \n\n“Come on Ed! Wake up!” Rav applied pressure on Ed’s nail-bed.\n\nEd opened his eyes and snapped out of it. “Oh god! IT WILL UNRENDER US! ITS ALL OVER!”\n\n“Focus on swimming Ed! Get swimming!”\n\nThe three of us all doggy-paddled away from the space-bending horrors, but the two spheres kept up rather easily. Bending the surroundings to chase Ed.\n\n“They’re after *me.*” Prof Ed struggled to catch his breath. “They’ve seen me die. They want to see it again!”\n\n“Keep Swimming!” I called out.\n\nBut instead, Ed looked at both Rav and I with a pained, tear-soaked face. He performed one last salute.\n\n“Ed! NO!”\n\nEd had dropped beneath the ball pit surface, and *dove* towards the floor. The two silver orbs had combined into one, following after him.\n\n“Claudia keep swimming!” Rav grabbed me by the collar and pulled me with his strokes. “Keep going! Keep going and don’t look back!”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe both swam through a seemingly endless river of red, yellow and blue plastic. The further we got away from the orbs, the quicker the space unbent around us, and we could find ground.\n\nSweet solid ground.\n\nWe only briefly stopped by the restaurant entrance to grab our bags. Apart from that, we kept running, and running, and running. \n\nAnd running. And running.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen we were at the entrance to the spiral staircase, I grabbed Rav’s hand. “But what about Ed? Don’t we have to…”\n\nRav looked at me with deep regret. “He’s gone, Claudia.”\n\n“You… sure?”\n\n“I mean you saw those things. They were messing with dimensional curvature around us. If we get caught in their orbit. We are *never* getting out.” \n\nI teared up, but I knew what he said was true.\n\nRav squeezed my hand back.  “I’m really sorry. But he’s gone. We have to keep going.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEd risked going into the orb, and faced the consequences. It wasn’t quite the wormhole exit we were looking for. But at least, now we know what to avoid.\n\nWhen we were back on the main floor and travelled at least six miles away, I transmitted what happened to Groups B and C. I told them that our duplication went successful, but sadly, we lost both copies of Professor Ed into a floating abyssal orb. \n\nI classified the orb as a high level threat. If anyone saw another silvery orb anywhere, we were to report it right away.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe lit a candle in Ed’s honor, and we both gave a few solemn words. \n\nFirst Clayton, now Ed. This was not a process I wanted to repeat every week.\n\nWe should have stopped Edward from stepping into the silver sphere. We probably should have stopped Ed from ever duplicating himself in the first place...\n\nBut what's done was done. We would learn from this mistake.\n\nWe had to keep moving. We had to keep our spirits up\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, Rav and I decided to camp at a *Bed, Bath & Beyond,* there was one bed on display that fit us perfectly.\n\nWith our backpacks off, Rav and I held each other, trying to lower our stress levels by focusing on our heartbeats.\n\n“Be honest.” I said. “Don’t bullshit me. Do you actually think there’s a way out?”\n\nRav rubbed my back for a prolonged time. He took a deep breath in, and then exhaled a deep breath out.\n\n“Well … Do you?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“So you think we're stuck.”\n\nRav stayed quiet for a moment.\n\n “I'm a mathematician, I study for patterns in things and try and find solutions based on those patterns.”\n\nI got off the bed. “And so what does two weeks of wandering in an **infinite mall** mean to you?”\n\n“You asked for my honest answer… and I gave it to you. I don’t know.”\n\nI looked at his melancholy face. He was forcing a small smile.\n\n“Do you want my other, more comforting answer?\n\n“Sure.”\n\nHe stood up and held my shoulder. “Each day we've stuck together. Each day we've been keeping eachother going. Based on this pattern, I'd say we make a good base pair.”\n\nI scoffed at this piece if romantic cheese. But he was right. We were still together. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDespite all the horrors we had been through, and all the nascent worries churning through me, that night with no one else around, on an empty bed with a store all to ourselves, we did what you might have anticipated.\n\nI was supposed to lose my virginity in my dorm room, somewhere back close to normal life. But I'll take what I can get. Silver linings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning when I was still half asleep, cuddling on the memory foam, I tried to imagine where Rav might take me on a morning date, if we were still back on the university campus. \n\nI magined us going for a small hike, walking through forest behind our university that led up a local hill. We’d traverse the trees, shrubs and find a little clearing that had a view of the whole school.\n\nThere we would sit, looking at the gorgeous, wide open sky, soaking in the morning sun. \n\nIt would be [beautiful.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EclosionK2\/comments\/1g0837r\/welcome\/)\n\n[UPDATE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kf1pw5\/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen\/)"},"72":{"title":"The Silence of the Midwest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke8mlk\/the_silence_of_the_midwest\/","flair":null,"author":"Impressive_Kiwi_7124","selftext":"Although a happy tale overall, my childhood was not without the pitfalls that come with an isolated midwestern farm life. \n\nDue to the tiny population of my school, and my community at large, I quickly gave up on the idea of companionship and settled into the simple joys of solitude. \n\nTo gaze through the fields of corn and soy onto a concrete road that seemingly dances eternally into the horizon--to awaken before the birds and tend to my family’s animals--to take a seat beside the paint-chipped porch railing and get lost in a novel until there's almost no sunlight left to read by. Simple pleasures that I could enjoy with solely my own company were the pinnacle of my existence at the time. \n\nMost days on the farm felt like a frolic through the Garden of Eden; however, like most children, my desires could not always be satiated.\n\nThe particular example that now screams within my memory happened when I was eight years old.\n\nNearly collapsing from boredom, I snuck up behind my mother while she was washing the dishes to shyly ask, “Can I go play in the field?” \n\n“No, treasure. It’ll be dark soon.”\n\n“But why mama? I’ll be careful! I promise!”\n\n“No, Joseph,” she responded, scrubbing the plate a little harder. “You’re not allowed out after dark! You know this.”\n\n“But whyyy,” I whimpered, undoubtedly fanning the flame of her annoyance. \n\n“She won’t let you out,” the response rang out in a husky tone from the opposite end of the room, “because after dark is when The Beast comes out.”\n\n“Bruno!” My mother whipped around to face the kitchen table where her brother sat. “Stop trying to scare your nephew!”\n\n“What Beast, Uncle Bruno?” I perked up, my fascination peaking above my fear.\n\n“There’s no Beast, treasure. Your uncle just likes making up foolish stories.”\n\n“Oh, come now, Helen!” Uncle Bruno nervously chuckled, setting down his newspaper and peering over the rim of his glasses. “He’s gonna have to find out about The Beast sooner or later. Better I tell him than he finds out the hard way.” He paused. “Like I did.”\n\nExhaling sharply, my mother turned back to the sink. “It’s late, Joseph. You should be getting to bed.”\n\n“Okay,” I forced out a little sigh as I turned away. “Uncle Bruno, will you tuck me in? I can’t sleep unless someone tucks me in.”\n\n“Sure thing,” he smirked, leaning down to me and shifting his voice to a whisper. “I can tell you more ‘foolish stories’ too, if you’d like.”\n\nMy eyes lit up brighter than the stars that shone above the vacant fields. \n\n“I’ll tuck you in,” my mother interjected. “After you brush your teeth. In the meantime, I’d like to have a word with your uncle.”\n\nAs I sulked upstairs and into the bathroom, I could hear my mother ruthlessly tearing into Uncle Bruno. I couldn’t discern a word of what was said, but the pure venom in her tone assured me that my Uncle’s promise of more stories would never be fulfilled.\n\t\nAll I heard from him that night were defeated whimpers.\n\nMy eyes began to well up with tears as I spat out the toothpaste and started towards my bed.\n\t\nWhen mother entered a few minutes later, she was met only with stoney rejection as I rolled over to face the window opposite my bedroom door.\n\nShe slunk across my carpet to sit beside me on my outer space themed comforter, her candy red locks brushing my face as she placed a delicate kiss onto my forehead.\n\t\n“Sleep safe, treasure. I love you.”\n\n“I’m already asleep. Go away.”\n\nShe let out a pained sigh, which I had interpreted as an admission of defeat. I had successfully gotten revenge for her unkindness to my uncle, and this small victory lulled me into a happy slumber as I marveled at the slivers of moonlight penetrating the black clouds in the midnight sky.\n\nAs I grew older, my mother began to provide me with more substantial reasons as to why I couldn’t go out past dark. When I was eight, it was because she said so, or because I might get lost. When I was twelve, it was because I might get kidnapped. When I was sixteen, it was because she didn’t trust me to drive safely and avoid all the potholes on the unlit country roads. Eventually, I gave in and grew accustomed to having a bedtime peculiarly early for a boy so close to adulthood. \n\nI’m fairly sure that the few other teens in the community had to abide by similar rules, as I never heard any news of a secret house party or a couple of young troublemakers sneaking a beer out in the fields. As darkness blanketed our community, everyone allowed it to fade into complete, inky silence.\n\nI coexisted with the silence of the midwest into my twenties. Even now, as a grown man and the primary caretaker of the farm, my body seems to automatically prepare to go to bed far before the rest of the world.\n\nIn addition to the family business, I’m also the one typically in charge of the grocery shopping. The closest grocery store is nearly an hour away, so I only venture out when the cupboards are totally barren.\n\nWhen he was still alive, Uncle Bruno was the one who’d drive us to the grocery store. He would let me pick out any desert I wanted in exchange for me not complaining about him blasting his favorite music on the way there and back. Usually, my mother and I couldn’t stand all the screaming in his favorite metal songs, but when I was zooming down the highway with my uncle and a fresh cupcake, any music could lift my spirits.\n\nLooking back, I wish I’d paused the music for just a moment and taken advantage of our solitude to talk to him more. To ask him more about his “foolish stories”, about exactly what he knew. \n\nThis would all make so much more sense if I had.\n\nThe particular day on which this story truly begins was the day of one of my infrequent excursions to restock the refrigerator. \n\nAs my silver Ford F-150 approached the patch of woods that separated my rural community from the rest of civilization, I began to notice an abnormal amount of trucks on the road.\n\nNot the kind you’d typically see along the highways, either. I saw at least seven identical armoured trucks, all coated in a suffocating black paint that seemed to absorb the light directly from my eyes. \n\nWeird, certainly, but easy enough to put out of mind and ignore.\t\n\nAs I began to reach the border between the concrete of the road and the dirt of the woods, I lightly pressed on the brakes, preparing to hit the series of insufferable potholes that littered the road leading out of town. They’d been there as long as I had, and I’d learned to learn to live with them, seeing as the city seemingly never decided to fix them.\n\nThe usual irritating sound of my truck bumping over the potholes was replaced with a sickening, wet squelch. \n\t\nShit, did I just hit a rabbit or something?\n\t\nThe unmistakable sound of juices being forced out of soft, organic material repeated from underneath my tires.\n\nPerplexed by the repulsive sound, I turned my car stereo down to nearly a zero and began to pull over, the squelching intensifying as I pulled over to the shoulder of the road.\n\nAs I stepped out of the Ford, my foot made contact with the source of my confusion, and with the final, soggy squirt, my foot sunk into a four inch pothole, taking the rest of my body down to the ground beside it. \n\n“Shit!” I cried out to an empty sky, yanking my wet appendage from the pothole.\n\nAs my eyes drifted to look over my leg for injuries, I found myself far more disturbed by the source of my pain than anything that it could’ve physically inflicted on me. \n\nThe pothole that I had fallen into was filled entirely with meat. \n\nRaw, bloody, and slightly caked with dirt, the thick hunks looked to have been intentionally placed to fill the hole perfectly, disturbed only by the unexpected intrusion of my stray limb.\n\nBaffled, I rose steadily from my seat on the pavement. Wanting to put this bizarre discovery behind me, I told myself that the trucks I saw were probably coming from some slaughterhouse and that one of them had accidentally spilled some of their product. It made no sense when I considered the seemingly systematic placement of the meat, but it was the most logical explanation that I had at the time.\n\nGreat, now my leg’s probably gonna bruise, I thought, taking one final glance over the road as I hopped back into the driver’s seat of my truck.\n\nThe sight I was greeted with rendered me frozen in an instant.\n\nAll of the potholes in the road were neatly packed with meat.\n\nEvery last one of them.\n\t\nWith a sudden sense of alarm, I thrust the vehicle into drive, quickly fading into the woods and hoping to forget how unsettled I was by the time that I reached the grocery store.\n\t\nI blasted through the forest and into town in record time, my confusion failing to fade over the course of the journey. By the time I reached the grocery store, my mind was still miles away, wandering aimlessly through the labyrinth of meaty lesions that plagued the road. \n\t\nAs I perused senselessly through the fresh fruits section, my hand brushed over the top of another’s as we both reached for the last mango.\n\t\n“Sorry,” I muttered, handing the mango to the hunched, elderly woman. \n\t\n“Oh, dear!” She gingerly placed the mango back into my hand as she shifted her gaze to meet mine. “Here, take it. You reached for it first, I believe.”\n\t\nMy eyes were illuminated with simultaneous gratitude and recognition. “Mrs. Selena! I haven’t seen you in a while.”\n\t\n“Oh, Joseph, is that you?” She adjusted her tiny glasses and smiled. “I could hardly recognize you! You’ve gotten so big since I last babysat you. How’ve you been, my boy?”\n\t\n“Yeah, I’ve been mostly, uh, good,” my typical struggles with small talk were exasperated by my extraordinarily absent mind.\n\t\n“How’s your mother? Does she still work on the farm? I passed your farm on the way here, you know. Looks like a lovely corn harvest this year!\"\n\n“Mom’s good, still working. Harder than she should be.”\n\nI inhaled sharply before changing the subject to the only thing that I could think of at that moment.\n\n“Mrs. Selena, did you drive through the woods on the way here?”\n\t\n“No other way to get here, my boy. Why do you ask?”\n\t\n“Did you see the, um. Uh, were the…”\n\t\nCuriosity in her gaze, Mrs. Selena tilted her head as I struggled to word my question properly. \n\t\n“Did you see the potholes?”\n\t\n“Oh, yes. Can’t drive into town without hitting one or two of them, I’m afraid.”\n\t\n“No, I mean…” I sighed as I spoke. “Did you see what the potholes were filled with?”\n\t\nNow her confusion was beginning to eclipse my own. “The meat, dear. As usual. Are you feeling alright?”\n\t\n“What?” I spat, sounding angrier than I felt. “What do you mean, ‘as usual’?”\n\t\n“It’s the first of the month, Joseph,” Mrs. Selena responded, taking on a far more serious tone. “Have you lost track of time?”\n\t\n“No, I haven’t--nevermind. Nice talking to you, Mrs. Selena,” I mumbled, clutching my shopping cart handle and rushing to the self checkout line.\n\t\nIf she responded, I didn’t hear her. I was utterly deafened by my own internal monologue. \n\nAs my auto-piloted arms inserted my debit card into the self-checkout and began to bag my groceries, only one thought repeatedly crossed my mind.\n\t\nI have lived in this town for twenty-four years and never once has this happened before.\n\t\nShuffling out to my truck and struggling to balance my excessive amount of grocery bags in my right arm, I began reaching for my cell phone with my left. As I piled the food into my trunk, I fumbled with the device as I attempted to find my mother’s number. \n\t\nThe phone cried out with its irritating buzz for thirty seconds before she picked up.\n\t\nI shifted my phone into my right hand as I yanked the truck door open and hopped into the driver’s seat, starting the car as the conversation began. \n\t\n“Joseph, are you alright? You’ve been taking more time to shop than usual,” my mother’s mildly concerned voice echoed through the phone’s tiny speakers, “You haven’t run off with some city girl, have you?”\n\t\nI pushed past her attempt at a joke straight into the heart of the matter. “Mom, I ran into Mrs. Selena at the grocery store today.”\n\n“The woman who babysat you back in the third grade? Or wait, was it the fourth grade?”\n\n“Doesn’t matter. I’m calling because she said something a little…weird.”\n\n“Well, she must be pretty old by now. Her mind…might not be all there anymore.”\n\n“Yeah, you’re right,” I sighed. \n\nBut just to be sure.\n\n“Mom, she said something about the potholes.”\n\nI need to know that I’m not crazy.\n\n“About the potholes being filled with meat. Is that—is that—normal? For the first of the month?”\n\nHer silence was deafening. \n\nMy heartbeat swelled in my chest, drowning out the noise of my tires tearing through the dirt roads of the woods as all of the blood rushed to my face in an orgy of red-hot panic. \n\nEither Mrs. Selena was losing her mind or I was, and my mother’s response would decide which.\n\t\nMy heart jolted to a stop as my mother’s voice cursed me from the other end of the call. \n\t\n“Joseph, are you feeling alright?”\n\t\nI failed to muster a response.\n\t\n“The meat’s on time as always, Joseph. Honey, have you forgotten?”\n\t\n“Love you, mom. Bye.”\n\t\nAfter unceremoniously ending the call, I continued the drive home in a stoney, screaming silence.\n\t\nDeparting from the forest, I caught one final glimpse of the potholes in the rearview mirror. Their curdled, blood-covered fillings seemed to joyously mock my slipping sanity long after they disappeared past my line of sight. \n\nThe final words of my mother echoed throughout my cranium even after I pulled into the driveway and ran up to my room, disregarding the groceries in the back of my truck.\n\n\"Have you forgotten?\"\n\nHad I forgotten? Or was this an ordinary tradition in our isolated little community that I had somehow been ignorant of for my entire twenty-four years of existence? No. It wasn’t possible. I’d driven that way maybe a hundred times. That road had raised me as much as my mother and my uncle and the fields of corn and soy that stretched past the twilight hour and into the new day.\n\nIn a moment of conviction, a moment of desperation for an explanation, I felt my Uncle Bruno smiling on me. My spirit of curiosity had been reanimated, and I would not allow it to die again.\n\nCome hell or high water, I would prove to myself that, despite how crazy I felt, I had never been more sane.\n\nAll I needed to do was go out after dark.\n\n\nFearful visions flashed before my eyes as my truck crept along the still country roads. \n\nThe smell of that raw meat, rancid and desperate to begin rotting. The fumes of the processed carcasses that littered my roads tortured me even in memory.\n\nThe sight of my mother, passed out in bed. I had checked at least a dozen times to ensure that she had been accosted by slumber before I ventured into the night.\n\nThe sound of my dear uncle, admonished for fueling my childhood curiosities. His tales of beasts, as irrational as they may be, vibrated through my skull as I passed through my hometown, totally blanketed by darkness, for the first time.\n\t\nThe feeling of the wind blowing through the truck’s windows, whipping my brown locks across my field of vision. It was late spring, but my hands were ice as they gripped the steering wheel.\n\t\nThe taste of shadow on my lips, chilling as death and twice as unfamiliar. I pulled the truck to the shoulder of the road right outside of the woods and I emerged, marching onto the road.\n\t\nIt was only when I reached the center of the potholes that I became aware of my absolute lack of a plan.\n\t\nSure, I had succeeded in traversing my neighborhood after dark. But other than that, what did this little excursion accomplish? This did nothing to prove my sanity, or that the placement of the meat was irregular. \n\nThis did nothing but force me to stare at the grotesque piles again, internally screaming as I fell into a pit of despair and questioning. \n\t\nSuddenly, I was a child again, and I feared my mother’s wrath were she to awaken and discover my transgression.\n\t\nCursing my aimless actions and my vain attempt to find some crumb, some inkling of conformation that my memory and mind were not failing me, I began stomping back to my parked vehicle. My thoughts of potholes and mysterious black trucks were quelled by the post-adrenaline clarity and compressed into a sigh.\n\nI was halfway to my truck when the road started shaking.\n\nNot in the way that it would have if a massive trailer truck had been barreling down it. This shaking was more akin to an earthquake, only, it wasn’t happening anywhere else but the road.\n\nIn a blind panic, I made a mad dash for the truck, where the shaking looked to be either less severe or nonexistent. It was difficult to tell with my teeth chattering and my vision blurring, the rumbling so severe that I felt on the verge of unconsciousness.\n\nMy legs tangled around each other and the road threw me into itself, knocking the air out of my lungs and sending a brutal pain shooting up my spine and into my skull. \n\nI tried to curse, to alleviate the pain with a string of profanities, but the words wouldn’t come. I could only muster tears, and the resolve to army crawl to the unshaking space beside my parked truck.\n\nI felt a trickle of blood snake down my face, but whether it had emerged from my nose or my mouth I could not discern. The dirt, tears and blood all converged into a hellish concoction that caked my face and added furth horror to this sensory experience.\n\nAs the road's eruption finally, mercifully ceased, I struggled and failed to push myself up onto all fours, collapsing onto my stomach in the muddy grass.\n\nThat’s when it appeared. \n\nThe thing that had caused all of this inexplicable madness. The thing that had made my little community fear the night for decades. The thing that my Uncle Bruno had referred to as “The Beast”.\n\nWhat I saw before me that chilly spring night was…indescribable. My mind could not fathom what it was witnessing then, and I still can’t fully muster the words to properly describe it. \n\nHowever, I will make an attempt. An attempt to describe something that, logically, could not exist.\n\nThe cloud had hundreds of what looked to be antlers emerging from every side of it, the only immediately recognizable features in its black, smokey mass. It stood on a thousand limbs, each with a thousand individual joints that snapped and popped with every minute shift in movement. It had no limbs. It hovered in utter, bone-chilling silence. It had the porcelain face of a screaming baby. It had no face at all. \n\nThe road beneath it was still concrete, but it flowed like a gelatinous river. It blinked and gasped for air, covered in eyes and orifices while somehow still completely smooth. Cartilage nails and stringy hairs seemed to protrude from the road in some places. \n\nIt was as if The Beast, and anything that it touched, operated at a lower frame rate than the world around it, yet it was moving faster than my mind could keep up with.\n\nAs desperate as I was to get away, to thrust myself into the truck, to scream, vomit and cry out for my mother to come save me--I couldn’t. My legs and vocal cords were paralyzed and unable to function. All of my survival instincts fled from my mind, and I was left on the side of the road panting, tears streaming down my paralyzed cheeks.\n\nThen it saw me. \n\nThe Beast lumbered forward, each step resounding with the sound of a thousand misshapen joints violently cracking as they shifted into a less and less perceivable figure. It flowed and gurgled, its millions of bloodshot eyes laser focused on my broken form. I could've sworn it was a childish malice that decorated some of its nonexistent faces, but looking back, I don’t think The Beast’s demeanor changed at all. Not visibly, anyway.\n\nIt lurched, it floated, it shifted, it swam; all at once, all in an effort to reach my trembling form.\n\nAnd somehow, it had been right in front of me the entire time.\n\nTo attempt to describe the fear that I felt in that moment would be a disservice to you, the reader, if you're expecting to walk away from this story with an adequate understanding of the horror that I endured. \n\nThe world was ending around me and I could do nothing but gaze on, my eyes pried open and my hands firmly rooted into the mud.\n\nI was sprawled out on the concrete for what felt like years, petrified in the intensifying gaze of a being that I knew I could never dream of understanding. Questions like, “what is it?” and “what does it want?” seemed irrelevant. You can’t understand something when its very existence goes against every law of the universe. You can’t reason with it. \n\nIt simply is.\n\nAfter the initial shock and terror, the central emotion that The Beast conjured within me was guilt.\n\nGuilt that I would dare endure another day upon a plane of existence in which this thing could manifest, and guilt that I would not do anything to stop it. Utter guilt and staggering horror at the idea of the mind-numbing complacency that would be required to ever live another day so close to such an unspeakable, unmistakable evil.\n\nWas the world simply, irrevocably cursed? Would my continued existence, were I to survive this encounter, merely perpetuate the doomed nature of the world?\n\nI felt the hot air eminenting from The Beast caress my mind as it’s shattered pieces melted. \n\nI think The Beast licked my face. I’m not sure how it could have, since it didn’t have a tongue, but it still somehow managed to coat my cheeks in a layer of thick, chunky slobber, a color that I couldn’t identify.\n\nThe Beast retracted from me within the slowest instant imaginable. \n\nThe fog contracted and expanded, in a twisted sort of labor. The road began swirling, faster and faster until I could barely watch without nausea taking over. \n\nI think I vomited, but it could’ve just been the slobber trailing down my face.\n\nThe Beast let out a tremendous, silent wail as its lips opened, emerging from the ground and encircling the potholes. Its lips caressed the curdled, repulsive rotten slabs of fatty meat in a slow, wet imitation of eating.\n\nThe speed of the swirling increased more and more, devouring the meat, the cloud, the road, the world.\n\nThere was only blackness for a moment.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes and lifted my face from the delicate blades of grass, I saw a completely ordinary road before me. No Beast, no fog, no spinning, no reality-bending phenomena.\n\nNo meat.\n\nJust a shit-ton of empty potholes, drawing the moonlight into them like a constellation of dying stars.\n\n\nI don’t have much of a memory of the subsequent return home. I know that I got back into the truck and silently pulled into the driveway. I know that I crept past my mother’s bedroom, up the stairs, and into my bed. I don’t think I even bothered to get underneath the covers.\n\nI used my inability to fall asleep to cry, to shiver, and to wallow in ceaseless contemplation. \n\nThis is a nightmare, and I’ll wake up any minute now. \n\nHow the hell can I just lay here while that thing is still out there? \n\nMaybe this will all go away if I ignore it. \n\nHow could I be so damn complacent? \n\nUncle Bruno, if you can hear me, please help. Oh, God, please help. \n\nThis is real. This is fucking real and everyone is in serious danger. \n\nGoddammit, is nothing really all I can do? \n\nI need to tell someone. Anyone…that’s the least I can do. \n\t\nThe tears were drenching my hands by the time I was shattered by realization.\n\t\nEverybody already knows.\n\nMy body ceased its trembling as I drew my hands away from my face, meeting the full moon with my gaze.\n\nMrs. Selena…Mom…oh God, Uncle Bruno…they all knew. They had to. The curfew, the meat…\n\nFuck, how many years? How many decades did they keep going along with whatever new rule they needed to to appease The Beast? And what for? Protection? Coexistence? Why the hell would they want to coexist with it? \n\t\nI considered getting up to write this all down at that very moment, to throw my testimony into the wind and succumb to the blind hope that someone on some paranormal forum would tell me exactly what I had experienced and what I could possibly do about it. \n\t\nBut I felt a sharp pain tugging at my eyelids, and, deciding to find a subreddit on which to confess my experience the next morning, I prayed that the inevitable migraine would force me into a merciful slumber. \n\nAnd forgiveness. I also prayed for forgiveness.\n\t\nAs the sting behind my eyes surged into agony and the tears on my cheeks began to evaporate, I teetered on the edge of sleep as my thoughts ferried me into a somber, dreamless unconsciousness.\n\t\nMaybe I was wrong. \n\nAbout all of this. \n\nMaybe they’ve always filled the potholes with meat.\n\t\nMaybe they always will.\n"},"73":{"title":"I’m a Virtual Therapist.

Not the couch-sitting, pipe-smoking stereotype, but the modern kind. Cognitive behavioral, trauma-informed, licensed, and remote.\nEverything’s remote now. Pandemic made it that way, but I never switched back.\nThree weeks ago, I took on a new client. Intake came through a youth crisis center. Female, 17. Referred after a home invasion that left both her parents dead. Said she watched it happen.\nHer name was Lydia.\nSession 1 started normal enough. Blank expression. Flat tone. No visible emotion, not even when I asked about the incident. Dissociation, I assumed. Trauma response. I noted it.\nBut by Session 2, something was… off.\nI noticed her screen lagging. Not glitching—lagging. There was a subtle delay between her movements and the sound of her voice. The image and audio weren’t out of sync. It was like her body was… catching up to her own words.\nAt one point, she said something, and the sentence kept going after her lips stopped moving.\nI chalked it up to latency. Bad Wi-Fi. Happens all the time.\nBut then she blinked. And I realized: she hadn’t done that once in the entire hour.\n\nSession 3, I logged in a few minutes early. Lydia was already there, just sitting in the call. Staring at the screen. Unmoving. Eyes wide, like she’d never learned how to hold a gaze casually.\nI asked if she was okay.\nShe replied, “Do you ever dream about your teeth falling out?”\nI hadn’t prompted anything. No small talk. No question. Just that sentence.\n“No,” I said. “Why?”\nShe didn’t answer.\nWhen I played the recording back—something I always do for notes—the question wasn’t there.

She didn’t answer.\nInstead, her mouth opened wide, far too wide, and stayed that way for about nine seconds. Silent.\nThen she said: “I like your clock.”\nI don’t have a clock.\nShe meant the one behind me.\nExcept… there is no clock behind me. I checked the recording. In her window, behind me, there was a clock—round, black hands, ticking slowly. Except the numbers were wrong. Just symbols. Not Roman, not Arabic. Not anything.\nWhen I turned around in real life, nothing was there. White wall. Same wall that’s always been there.\nRecording timestamp:\n [Client smiles.

It's past midnight now, and I'm pretty sure adrenaline is the only thing keeping me awake right now. I keep hearing voices, whispers, coming from the fog. I don't know if I'm going crazy, but I really don't feel like testing that theory right now. I was hungry, I was parched, but I was scared. The only thing I brought to the car was my colt, foolishly, I didn't think id be in here long. \n\n\n\nI looked through my neighbours window, and I swear, I saw eyes looking back at me. It gave me the same feeling I had on the country road. I didn't want to start making assumptions, but I think it followed me home, whatever it was.\n\n\n\nI knew I couldn't stay here. I tried to reason with myself, if this … thing … was going to hurt me, surely it would have by now, right?  I doubt that a seven year old Toyota was its weakness. It probably wanted me to stay in the car, driving myself crazy. This is when I realised, how much of a coward I was. Day by day, I lived my life being cocky and confident, but now that I needed that fake courage, I was a coward. As much as I wanted to sit here and self-actualise, I needed to get to the house. It probably wasn't any safer than the car, but at the time, it felt like it would be, and that was good enough for me.\n\n\n\nOne hand was gripping the car door handle, the other gripping my dad's colt, I took some deep breaths, bracing myself. It was simple, I could get from my driveway, to the porch, and into my house in 15 seconds. It was 15 seconds too long, in my opinion, but I needed to grow some balls for once.\n\n\n\nMustering up the courage, I click the handle, pushing the door open just enough for me to get out. I make a break for the house, I hear whistles behind me, at a low pitch no human should be able to make, some in the distance, some sounding so close that I could feel the vibrations on my neck. I didn't look behind me, I didn't wanna see whatever ungodly being was in that fog, I had a feeling if I did, id end up looking just like my neighbour and his dog.\n\n\n\nI made it to my front door, it was already open a crack. I had no time to do my usual routine of slowly pushing it open. Not losing any momentum, I slammed into the thick wooden door with my shoulder, it flung open, and I fell to the floor, expecting more resistance. I hurriedly got back up, trying to shut it, praying for the sound of the lock clicking shut. Eventually, my prayer was granted. \n\n\n\nI stood still, pressed against the door for a few minutes. I knew it was locked, but, well, I don't really know why I was still there, I wasn't exactly in a stable frame of mind. Paranoia doesn't exactly go hand in hand with decision making. \n\n\n\nOnce I realised that I was 'safe', I decided now would be a good time to pool my resources. I knew id be alone for a few days. The only other person that lived in this house was my sister, and she was staying at her friends house straight from school for the weekend, so I knew she was safe. I hoped at least, I didn't want to consider that this was happening elsewhere. \n\n\n\n8 Bottles of water, 2 cans of soda, 5 cereal bars, Yesterdays pizza leftovers, Tinned vegetables, A pack of instant ramen. A colt 1911 and a healthy handful of ammo for it\n\n\n\nIt wasn't much, and in my defence, I was supposed to get groceries tomorrow. It was enough to last me for a few days if I rationed correctly, but I hoped it wouldn't come to that. I started to wonder why I still even carried the gun. I haven't even seen a physical figure to aim at, not like id have the composure to hit the target if I did see anything.\n\n\n\nSat on the couch, I flicked through the channels on the TV, nothing but static. Whatever was outside was messing with the signal, as well as my mind. \n\n\n\nI looked out of the window, peering behind the cheap curtains. The fog was thicker now, I couldn't see past my porch now. My car was no longer visible. The whistles continued, each one feeling closer, but none topping the one I heard on my sprint to the door, the security of the house didn't go unnoticed to me. I continued to stare out of the window. Occasionally, I thought I saw a figure deep in the mist. My rational side hoped that it was just my cynical mind playing tricks on me, I remember learning in school that your brain can do that, not that any sort of conventional science could explain this... thing. The vengeful side of me hoped that I was seeing something, I craved to see something physical to pin the death of my neighbour and my own mental suffering onto. \n\n\n\nMy staring session was cut short when I heard a crash from behind me, it sounded like glass. Everything in this room looked fine at first glance, so I presumed that it came from the kitchen. A million possibilities ran through my mind, did it smash the window? did it get in the house? what the hell even is 'it'? I grabbed my gun, carrying it like someone out of a cheesy cop show, I flung open the door from the living room to the kitchen, my eyes darting to the window. I breathed half a sigh of relief, the window was still intact. Dirty, but intact. My momentary bliss was over when I realised what the source of the noise was. The fridge was slightly ajar, just enough for the inside light to be turned on, illuminating the otherwise dark room. my eyes worked their way down to the floor, the weird red drink that I tried earlier had smashed onto the tile floor, sending shards of glass everywhere, whilst that was inconvenient, that wasn't what made my heart sink. The red liquid, which I now presumed was blood, wasn't in a pool on the floor like it should be. It had been meticulously formed into shapes. The more I squinted, I started to realise, the blood hadn't just formed random abstract patters, it made letters, words, even.\n\n\n\nAfter careful analysis, I just about managed to make out the words \"it needs to feed\" \n\n\n\nThis made me sick to my stomach. I collapsed onto the cold kitchen floor, with little care about cushioning my fall. I had never felt more lost. I would of broken down into tears if I still had the energy. I hadn't slept properly for over 24 hours at this point.\n\n\n\nAt first, I thought it was just playing some sort of sick game with me. I had been hoping that it would get bored, lose interest maybe.\n\nAny hope I had previously had been stomped on and shattered. It was playing with me, it was hunting me. My neighbour served as good of an example as any of what happens when the fog gets needs to feed.\n\n\n\nI sat there for what must have been 15 minutes, just staring at the ceiling, wondering what it will feel like. When it takes my blood, will I still be alive? Or will it have enough sympathy to make it quick. Is sympathy even a word in this predator's vocabulary? This continued for a while, starting to spiral into a depressive madness.\n\n\n\nEventually, I stood up, looking out of the window, I swear, I locked eyes with whatever was out there, I couldn't see anything, but I knew it was looking back at me\n\n\n\nI defy you, stars\n\n\n\nThe fog was a faint red now, but I wasn't scared, not anymore. I was dead either way.\n\n\n\nI looked out of the window. My adrenaline was running low, but I still had enough.\n\nI was gonna go out on my own terms, I wasn't gonna sit, rotting in this house for any longer, whilst that thing watched, mocking me with it's whistles.\n\n\n\nI was going to open that front door, and I was going to run, until either my legs gave up, or the thing in the fog did. Deep down, I knew which would cave first.\n\n\n\nI chugged a can of soda for its caffeine, and headed towards the front door. My hands were trembling, my heart was pounding so fast that it felt as though the house shook with every beat. It made me light headed, my own fear was getting in the way, like it had done at every other stage of my life. I couldn't even grab the door handle properly. I didn't want to admit it, but in what was supposed to be my final noble act, I still felt like a coward.\n\n\n\nThat was my final thought before I blacked out.\n\n\n\nI must have been unconscious for about 8 hours, my body was catching up on some much needed sleep. I was eventually awoken by an unexpected, but welcomed noise.\n\nBirds were singing outside. I woke up, quickly getting to my feet. Once I got over the initial light-headedness, I headed to the window, peering behind the curtains, I saw a beautiful blue sky, and the even more beautiful Nevada sun. \n\n\n\nHad the fog finally lifted? Hell, was any of it real to begin with? \n\n\n\nI stumbled to the kitchen, still a little sore from sleeping on the floor last night. The smashed glass was still in the same place, but the blood was just pooled up. No words, no cryptic messages. \n\n\n\nI saw my phone on the kitchen table, I instantly grabbed it. I was on low battery, but that was good enough for me.\n\n\n\nI had one notification,  it was from my sister, sent at 2am\n\n\n\n\"Hey, just letting you know that ill be coming back earlier than expected, something came up with Rachel, its a family emergency.\"\n\n\n\nI dropped my phone, instantly sprinting upstairs, I was praying that id see her tucked into her bed, annoyed with me for barging in so early.\n\n\n\nThat is not what I saw.\n\n\n\nI opened her bedroom door, her bed was completely untouched. Her friend, Rachel was only a one hour walk from here, and that message was sent well over 8 hours ago. She should of been home by now.\n\n\n\nI made my way back downstairs, my footsteps heavy. I didn't want to open the door, but I had to. Deep down, I already knew what was on the other side.\n\n\n\nAfter working up the physical and mental strength, I opened the door wide.\n\nMy sister had made it home after all.\n\n\n\nI broke down into tears, her lifeless, bloodless husk laid in front of the door, she was so close to me, but I still couldn't save her. \n\n\n\nThe fog had fed.\n\n\n\nI eventually called the police. I cleaned up the blood on my kitchen floor before they got here, that would of been too much to explain.\n\nI played dumb, acting like I had just got home and found this. There's no cameras around here, they cant prove that I'm lying.\n\n\n\nIt's an ongoing investigation, I know it will never be solved. only I knew the truth. It came from the fog.\n\n\n\nI'm sharing this anonymously in hopes that someone will understand or relate to what I'm talking about, if so, please reach out.\n\n\n\nFor those who don't, just stay away from the fog in Nevada, and don't stare into it for too long."},"75":{"title":"I found my doppelganger on the dark web.

The noise tore me straight out of a nightmare about the white room; I remember sitting bolt upright, unsure as to whether the sound had come from myself or someone else. When a few seconds passed without further commotion, I decided that it hadn't come from a human at all, but instead an animal or even a passing car. \n\n\n\nWhatever the case, I was wide awake, and so I grabbed my laptop and almost instinctively navigated to DOV3S. Checking my email, I saw that I had not yet heard back from either the police or the IC3, but I had expected as much. So little time had passed, after all. What I had *not* expected was the reply that I received from Adam, which he had sent just after midnight.\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Ok. Let's talk. You're going to school at \\[REDACTED\\], right? I live around 90 minutes southwest from there. I don't have a car right now, but if you want to talk in person and you have time to kill, we can meet up in my town.* \n\n\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that he'd come around, though I wasn't exactly sure what had changed his mind. Seeing Mary's missing persons report likely convinced him that there was real danger in what we'd discovered. Desperate for answers and itching for something to do while I waited for the police, I accepted his invitation. Seeing that Adam was online despite the early hour, I gave him a call, although he quickly declined it. \n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*I can't talk right now.*\n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*Sorry. I guess it's still early.*\n\n*I'm happy to meet you and I don't mind driving out.* \n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Cool. Let's not do a cafe or restaurant though. I don't really want to be overheard. There's a trail near my house where we can have some privacy. I'll send you the address of the trailhead if that works for you. Can you do 6:30 PM?*\n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*Yeah. I can do any time today really.*\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Make sure to bring your phone and laptop and any other electronic devices you've used recently.* \n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*On the hike?*\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*I was hoping we could go to my place after. I'll explain in more detail in person, but I have some theories about how the deep fakes are being made and need your help to test them out.* \n\n*Sending the address now.*\n\n\n\nMaking a plan gave me comfort, and after Adam and I finished working out the logistics of our impromptu get together, I managed to catch a few more hours of sleep. I then spent the late morning attempting to distract myself with schoolwork. When that failed, I returned to Tor. Instead of going straight to DOV3S, I searched for the forums that Adam had mentioned.\n\n\n\nI did find one relevant conversation on *MirrorFrame*, which seemed like a website for rehosting lost or banned videos. \"Help ID the actress in this vid?\" read the title of the post. Attached was a twenty second clip from one of Angelica's videos. *Puncture 12*, I realized. I had spent so long staring at the sample images that I could recognize this particular video from the lighting and framing alone. I think it was this, the fact that I'd become so familiar with this content, that frightened me even more so than the video itself, which featured \"Angelica\" getting stabbed in the calf with what looked like a marlinspike. \n\n\n\nThis particular clip of *Puncture 12* had audio. Unlike Angelica's sample video, which had been all grunts and sobs, this video actually had dialogue. She didn't say much, but the few words that Angelica said, she said in my voice. Somehow, hearing myself beg someone to stop hurting me made me far more nauseous than the deep fake visuals ever had. \n\n\n\nThe only vaguely positive thing about the thread was the single comment:\n\n\n\n*good luck! the DOV3S team is extremely private. 0 info about the models. i'd be surprised if that girl actually exists.* \n\n\n\nI used my phone to take a video of *Puncture 12*, then set my laptop down. I had learned two new things from the forum:\n\n\n\nThe first was that whoever was behind DOV3S had access not just to photos of me, but to recordings of my voice. This eliminated some of my earlier suspects, including the modeling agent from my teenage years. While he would've had enough content of me to make a deep fake, I never met him in person, and I never sent him any video recordings of me speaking. It would have been impossible for him to replicate my voice so convincingly. \n\n\n\nMy second epiphany had to do with the sole comment on the thread. For whatever reason, DOV3S' maker was protecting my true identity. If this were someone who hated me personally, they would *want* to put me in danger. They would *want* their crazed fans to know exactly who I was. I couldn't reconcile the malevolence of their actions with this small saving grace. \n\n\n\nInspired to continue my search, I punched in DOV3S' url and waited. And waited. And then waited some more. Eventually, I got the generic \"Onion site not reachable\" screen, no error code, no redirect. I refreshed. Nothing. I waited a few minutes. Nothing. I reopened Tor. Nothing. \n\n\n\nThe site was gone, at least temporarily. I wanted to be optimistic and believe that the FBI had taken them down after my complaint, but I doubted it. It was more likely the case that they'd relocated to a new .onion address or rotated to a fallback link, but why? Did they know someone was onto them? Was it something Adam had done? \n\n\n\nI spent all afternoon trying to find out where the site had migrated to, but it was hopeless. I left my apartment at around five, and the minute I walked out the door, I was overcome with a sense of relief. Looking back on it, I had felt sick all day, but I hadn't entirely noticed until I stepped outside. \n\n\n\nDue to traffic, I didn't arrive at the trailhead until nearly seven. As soon as I parked, I received a text message from Lydia. \n\n\n\n***Lydia:*** *No creep today, but I still think you should sleep at my place tonight. Don't like thinking of you alone in that apartment.* \n\n\n\n***Lydia:*** *Btw I told Ben what's been going on and he says he thinks he saw the guy get into his car yesterday. He said it was a Jeep Cherokee XJ.*\n\n\n\nReading that made my gut churn. Of course, I'd already suspected it, but the confirmation that Angelica's \"fan\" knew where I lived was horrific. I decided that I'd sleep in a hotel that night, only briefly swinging by my apartment to grab a change of clothes. I also resolved to visit the police station in person the next day to see what could be done. I texted Lydia my plans, then focused my attention on my meeting with Adam. \n\n\n\nThe hills were a beautiful little swath of nature, quiet but not too isolated from the city. There were a few other cars in the parking lot and a few people walking their dogs. I did not, however, see anyone that looked like Adam. I messaged him that I had arrived, and he quickly replied.\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Cool, I'm on the trail. Make a left at the first fork and I'm sitting on the bench.*\n\n\n\nI got out of my car and started to walk. It was a warm evening, and under any other circumstances, I would've been delighted by the balmy breeze and colors of golden hour. I walked up the trail for a few minutes and saw the fork in question. I looked to the left, but thanks to the curve of the trail, it was difficult to see very far ahead. \n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*Hey I'm at the fork.*\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Take the trail on the left.* \n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*Can you come down*\n\n\n\nI waited for a few minutes. Adam kept starting to type, then stopping. The sun was starting to set at that point, and I didn't want to be on an unfamiliar hiking trail after dark if I could help it. I gave Adam another call, but once again, he immediately declined.\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*Walk down the trail on the left.*\n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*Why can't you just walk down and meet me here? You're freaking me out*\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*I'm like 30 ft away from the start of the trail it's fine*\n\n\n\n**\\[Me\\]**\n\n*I don't see you*\n\n\n\n**\\[Adam\\]**\n\n*But I see you*\n\n\n\nI looked up from my phone, startled. There was no one else around, not even up on the ridges that overlooked the trailhead. No way in hell was I going any further up that trail. I waited around dumbly for a while longer, then decided to call it a day. As I turned around and started walking back to my car, I heard a man's voice say my name. I froze for a minute, whipping my head back in the direction of the trail. I opened my mouth to respond, but when I still didn't see anyone, I closed it and ran back to my car, thoroughly spooked. Though I didn't see anyone following me, I started the engine immediately and began my drive back home.\n\n\n\nThe entire way back to my apartment, I felt like screaming. That whole meeting had either been an elaborate joke or worse, a setup. I considered the possibility that it was Adam behind the deep fakes. He was a software engineer and certainly had the technical know-how to create them. He had been strange and standoffish throughout every one of my interactions with him and seemed to have something to hide. He grew up in my town and easily could've lied about knowing Mary. Despite all of these factors, though, he was missing a motive, and furthermore, he himself was a victim. \n\n\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment building, before getting out of my car, I scrolled through my message history with Adam. Not only had his perspective on DOV3S changed since the day prior, but so too had his texting style. It was subtle, and it could've been explained away by him typing on a computer vs a phone, but the texts he had sent me that day felt more formal. Better grammar, fewer sporadic line breaks. Maybe something had happened to him the day before. Maybe the Adam I was texting on that day was not the same person I had been texting previously. Again, it could've been a coincidence, but I still planned to bring it up with the police the next day. \n\n\n\nI went inside of my apartment after that, dejected and exhausted. Every new \"lead\" I had uncovered only brought me more questions, and now I couldn't even unwind in the comfort of my own home. That heavy, nauseous feeling I'd had all morning returned in full force once I stepped into my apartment and turned on the lights. I planned to use the bathroom, grab a few things, and make my way to the cheap-ass Motel 6 uptown. I threw my bag down, grabbed my phone, and headed to my miniscule bathroom.  \n\n\n\nIt was pretty stuffy in there, so I decided to let in some air. Putting both hands on the frame, I noticed that the latch was undone. Had I forgotten to lock the window the night before? I could have sworn I locked it. The thought of sleeping with an unlocked window while someone was actively stalking terrified me, but it was nothing compared to what happened next. \n\n\n\nI opened the window, and the bathroom was filled with a *screech* that sounded exactly like a scream. I knew instantly that it was the same sound I'd heard in the morning, the one that had awoken me. \n\n\n\nSomeone had opened my window in the night. What if he had let himself inside?\n\n\n\nWhat if he never left? \n\n\n\nSuddenly, I got the sense that I was not alone in my apartment. Quickly, I locked the bathroom door, then tried to listen for movement over the deafening pounding of my heart. I thought I heard the faintest sound of fabric rustling, and my every nerve screamed in response. *Get out*, they said, and I listened. I threw the window open all the way and jumped out. Before sprinting down the street, I stole one last look into the bathroom, just in time to see the handle turn as someone tried the locked door. \n\n\n\nAfter that, I ran like hell to the first open, public building I could find: a 24\/7 convenience store a quarter of a mile from my place. I phoned the police from inside, and when they arrived, I told them about everything—DOV3S, the customer, Mary, my strange encounter on the trail, my suspicion that something may have happened to Adam. Thankfully, they took my words very seriously, especially since I had already started a paper trail and since I had several witnesses from the cafe to back me up. Before they took me down to the station to file an official report, they escorted me back to my apartment and searched the place. There was no one inside, but the unlocked front door and the plethora of stolen items, everything from my diary to some of my clothes, made it pretty damn obvious what had happened. \n\n\n\nI booked a flight home that night and left town the following morning. I was never close with my parents, even less so after the shit they put me through as a teenager, but I desperately needed an escape. If I had it my way, I would've packed up and moved to the middle of nowhere and never been seen by anyone ever again. Since I couldn't do that, I retreated to the only place I could think of—my hometown, the place where all this DOV3S business seemingly began. If nothing else, maybe I could finally find the answers I was looking for there. \n\n\n\nI watched the sunrise from 40 thousand feet in the air, and the sight soothed me tremendously. I looked down at my phone, swiping back and forth between two screenshots that I'd sent myself—one of Adam's selfie, and one of Mary's. I studied them like a mother whose adult kids had long moved far away from home. There was a terrible ache in my heart as I thought of all they’d likely been through, and the fact that I didn’t know if either of them were safe at that moment. \n\n  \n\n\n*I'm gonna find out what happened to you*, I thought, not a wish, but a promise.\n\n"},"76":{"title":"Incomplete thesis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke7nz7\/incomplete_thesis\/","flair":null,"author":"ConstantDiamond4627","selftext":"I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.\n\nIn the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.\n\nThe hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.\n\nI tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.\n\nI woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever had—well, a dream I remembered.\n\nAt that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.\n\nI lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.\n\nThere, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: \"Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers.\" I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: \"The queen watches even when she sleeps.\" I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.\n\nI simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.\n\nHowever, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.\n\nI remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.\n\n\"When was the last time you went out to the garden?\" she asked me.\n\n\"A week ago,\" I replied.\n\nBut when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.\n\nThe last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.\n\nThe truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.\n\nThe thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. \"Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation.\" A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word \"solid.\" Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.\n\nDays later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldn’t get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in again—this time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses. It was Alejandra who found me and took me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The psychiatrist explained everything with professional calm: prolonged isolation, academic stress, sleep deprivation, possible genetic predisposition. She prescribed anxiolytics, antidepressants, and a mild hypnotic to help me sleep. Since then, that chemical combination has been with me. Some days I forget who I was before. Other days, I prefer not to remember.\n\nI never worked with bees again. I tried a couple of times, at the beginning. I visited an apiary with a colleague, more out of politeness than genuine interest. But the buzzing... that buzzing. Not the one from real bees, but the other one—lower, more intimate, the one that doesn’t travel through the air but inside the skull. That one is still there. I gave up the experiments. I left sensory entomology. I requested a transfer. Now I teach molecular and cell biology at the same university. The students listen attentively, and some even ask why I never talk about hymenopterans (bees, wasps, ants)... since it’s the field I graduated from. I just smile and change the subject.\n\nSometimes—not always, but on some nights—when sleep evades me even with the help of the pills, the buzzing returns. Not as an actual sound. More like a presence, a mental frequency. It's there when silence is absolute, when my breathing sounds louder than it should, when the darkness feels thicker than usual.

Maybe I’m just incubating it."},"77":{"title":"I Keep Finding Spare Keys In My Apartment.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke2fpo\/i_keep_finding_spare_keys_in_my_apartment\/","flair":null,"author":"SubjectState7","selftext":"It started the day I moved in. The lady from the property management company (it was always a lady) brought me into the place and handed me two keys. They were for the front door, both the deadbolt and knob locks. I thanked her, and we shook hands. I went through the place with a fine tooth comb, taking pictures of any pre-existing damage.\n\nAs I surveyed the living room, I saw an object lying underneath one of the baseboard heaters. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a key. It was coated with dust and a thin layer of grime. I washed it off in the sink and considered what it could be for. The first thing that came to mind was the front door, so I started there.\n\nIt worked. On both the deadbolt and door knob, it worked.\n\nI called my property manager to explain the situation, and (to my surprise) they were cool about it. They had to replace a key when the previous tenant lost one, and assumed this was the one I’d found. They marked my apartment down as having three keys instead of just two, and told me to make sure I left all three in the unit when I moved out. This seemed fair to me, and for a while, that was the end of it.\n\nA few months into my lease, however, I found another. It was under the kitchen sink, deep in the far right corner of the cabinet. I had slid some paper towels under there and felt the key slide back until it hit the wall. I pulled out the paper towels and looked inside with my phone’s flashlight. Sure enough, there it was. It was in similar condition to the first, caked with dust and grime. This was the first time I performed the ritual of find key, try key. Of course, it worked in both locks on my front door. This was on a Saturday and my landlord’s office wouldn’t open until Monday. So I placed the key on the counter and went about my weekend.\n\nWhen I called on Monday, they actually sent someone out to collect and verify it.\n\n“Well, this is a pickle,” the lady said, holding both keys in her palm. “The last time this unit had to replace a key, before recently, was eight years ago.”\n\n“It *was* under the sink,” I said. “It’s possible nobody noticed it until now.”\n\n“True, but I wonder how it got down there in the first place.”\n\nThat was something I hadn’t considered. The first had been in the living room under the heater. It made sense that someone could have dropped and left it there. It made less sense that another ended up *under* the kitchen sink.\n\n“I’ll leave this one with you,” she said, handing me the first key I’d found. “This one I’ll take back to the office.” She placed the key into her purse before wishing me a good day and leaving.\n\nIn the months that followed, I found more and more keys. At their request, I stopped calling my landlord. I was told to collect any keys I found and keep them safe until I moved out. They would dispose of them after I was gone.\n\nNow, the last thing I want to do is piss off my landlord, so I’m turning to Reddit. I gotta tell somebody about this because it’s getting out of hand. They’re everywhere. In my shower, on my desk, even in my goddamn microwave. That last one I only found because it started sparking when I tried heating up a bowl of soup. And now they’re appearing in... aggressive ways. One was stabbed through the center of my TV like a fucking railway spike. Another was in my garbage disposal, which demolished it the second I turned it on. I found them lodged in the windows, the patio door, the bathroom mirror (more than once), and even in one of my car’s tires. \n\nI was at a loss for what to do. The property management was unresponsive to my calls and emails on the matter, and were quick to tell me that this wouldn’t get me out of my lease early. I’d still have to pay out or find someone to take it over. So, despite everything that had happened to me, I decided to grin and bear it for the remaining three months of my lease.\n\nThen came a turning point. Not too long after I moved in, I adopted a black cat who I named Mystic. She’s a great roommate (even if she scratches my couch and her poops are nuclear when she doesn’t bury them). She’s very cuddly though and always greets me at the door with a little *mrrp* when I get home from work or leave my bedroom in the morning.\n\nSo when I left my bedroom last week and she didn’t greet me, I tensed up. Looking down the hallway, I noticed speckles of a dark liquid on the floor leading into the living room. My heart sank as I bolted down the hall and found her there, lying on her side in the middle of the room. She was breathing hard and there was a key stabbed into her hind right leg.\n\nEverything was a blur after that. I know I scooped her up, felt the dried blood on her black fur, and rushed to the nearest vet. Thankfully, they removed the key and stitched up the wound no problem. Afterwards, they hesitated to send her home with me, thinking I’d done this to her. But when they saw how badly she wanted to be near me the second she woke up, the hesitation vanished. I was thankful for that, but didn’t want to bring Mystic back to my apartment. So I took her to my mom’s to stay for a bit while I figured things out.\n\nMy plan had been to research my apartment building and see if anything like this had ever been reported to the authorities or talked about online. I didn’t get very far, though, because this morning I woke up to find a key in bed with me. It was lying near my right calf with the tip pointed towards me. The message was clear enough. I wasn’t sure if I’d provoked it (whatever “it” is) by digging into its past or if it just wanted to hurt me. I’m not even sure if there is an “it” in this situation. Regardless, after that experience, I headed to a hotel. I booked two nights and am spending the first by writing this post.\n\nMy plan now is to go to the apartment in the daylight tomorrow and grab some more stuff, including the sandwich bag I’ve kept the keys in and a copy of my lease. I also want to count the keys. It’s something I’ve put off far too long. I doubt it’ll do any good, but it’ll satiate my curiosity if nothing else."},"78":{"title":"My aunt owns a thrift shop.

The concrete abomination of an apartment building across the way stared back at me. Most of the lights were off, but a few of them glowed yellow in the darkness. I wondered if the residents knew how close they were to an entire treasure trove of magical, and usually evil, artifacts. Like the equivalent of living next to a giant wasp’s nest, ready to break through at any time.\n\nI checked the lock several times, but there was really no need. Even muggers stayed out of this alleyway. Like they somehow sensed the artifact’s presence.\n\nA figure finally appeared around the corner. And, then… a second one behind it.\n\nI squinted and unlocked the door.\n\n“You brought *him?!”* I hissed as I ushered Kira and Elias inside.\n\n“He caught me sneaking out. Said he’d tell Mom if I didn’t let him come along,” Kira replied, shooting Elias a look. “He’s too lame to have his own friends, so he has to blackmail me into taking him along.”\n\n“That’s not true!” he protested, crossing his arms.\n\nNormally I’d use this opportunity to roast him to all hell, but I wasn’t in the mood. “You know what? It wouldn’t hurt to have another set of eyes.”\n\nElias raised an eyebrow. “Really?” He glanced at me, then Kira. “Wow. This must be *really* serious, if you’re not making fun of me.”\n\n“It is. She… she didn’t tell you?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nI explained to him what I saw. Then I gestured them back to Aunt Gigi’s office. I handed a copy of the manual to each of them, then grabbed a sheet of paper and sketched out the necklace. “Look for something like this.”\n\n“That looks like a dick,” Kira said.\n\n“It’s a *heart.*” I drew over it again, so that one side of the heart was not longer than the other.\n\nThen the three of us sat down and began paging through the manuals. “Hey, does your aunt have anything to eat in there?” Elias asked, gesturing to the fridge behind me.\n\n“Maybe, but she keeps it locked,” I replied, gesturing to the bike lock on the handle. “She had this employee that kept stealing all her food, and she got really pissy about it. I think she fired her a few months ago. Hence the job opening,” I said with a flair of my hands.\n\n“I mean, I respect that,” Kira said. “Kevin would always steal my yogurts at work. It fucking *sucked.* Never admitted to it, either. But I know it was him.”\n\n“Yeah, I had this guy…” Elias started.\n\nI frowned. We were, very quickly, derailing. “Come on, guys, let’s keep looking through the manual. I want to find out what’s going on. Maybe we can even get some sleep tonight.”\n\n“Yes ma’am,” Kira said mockingly. I narrowed my eyes at her.\n\nWe were interrupted by a sharp knock sounded on the office door.\n\nThe three of us froze.\n\n*Aunt Gigi?*\n\n*Rap-tat-tat!* The knocking was accompanied by a heavy, metallic clanking sound. As if the person was… wearing chains?\n\nI glanced at the gap underneath the door. The silhouettes of two legs. I swallowed.\n\n“Let me in,” came a deep, resonating voice. A voice that was echoey and muffled at the same time, like it was coming through… *metal?*\n\nI grabbed the manual and flipped through it.\n\n*Oh.*\n\n*Entity #512*\n\n*Class I*\n\n*Presentation: Entity #512 is a 215-pound suit of armor that stands at six feet, two inches tall. It is made of iron and carries an axe. The helmet completely encloses the head and neck, except for a narrow slit that is four inches long and a quarter inch wide at eye level. Heat scans show that the temperature inside the suit is 98.6\\*F. However, an MRI of the suit produced a jumbled mess of organs and tissue, with no centralized brain, calling into doubt that #047 was once human. It is more likely to be mimic than human in nature.*\n\n*Safety Precautions: #047 is considered a relatively harmless entity. No deaths have occurred from contact with #047. The entity activates and becomes mobile every night between three and four AM, Eastern Standard Time. It does not observe daylight savings time. It is not aggressive, however, it does seek out heat sources (such as humans and warm-blooded animals), possibly for companionship. #047 is clumsy with its axe; therefore, it is best to keep at least six feet away, or stay in a locked room until the hour has passed.*\n\n*Recovery Procedures: Wait until 4:00 AM before getting within six feet of #047.*\n\n*Origin: #047 was found in Western England in 1963.*\n\n“That’s not creepy at all,” I whispered.\n\n“Okay, so we should be safe in here. Right?” Elias asked, eyeing the door just as another set of knocks sounded.\n\n“As long as the door holds,” I said, as the door rattled with each knock. I glanced at the clock on the wall—3:07 AM.\n\nWe had almost an hour to endure of a sentient suit of armor knocking on our door.\n\n*Great.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Is this it?”\n\nI glanced over at the page Elias was pointing to. “Dude, that’s not even a locket,” I said.\n\n“… Oh. I thought it was…”\n\nI rolled my eyes and continued flipping through the book. #274, a fire poker that paralyzed those it stabbed. #352, a sentient bookshelf that absorbed all the information the books held. Sounded fun, honestly, and it was only a Class I. Maybe I could persuade Aunt Gigi to let me take it home.\n\n*Aunt Gigi…*\n\nA little pang went through me. How could she have so many secrets? What, exactly, was she hiding? I rubbed my forehead and flipped to the next page. And the next, and the next…\n\n“Wait,” Kira said from across the table. “I think I found it.”\n\nHer eyes were wide, and her mouth hung open. My heart dropped.\n\nElias and I ran over.\n\n*Entity #762*\n\n*Class II*\n\n*Presentation: A heart-shaped gold locket strung on a thin chain, with a 1-carat peridot stone set in the front.*\n\n*Safety Precautions: #762 does not present any direct danger. When worn, it has the ability to transform the physical likeness of the wearer. A personal effect must be kept inside the locket that contains intact DNA of the person (or animal) the wearer intends to look like.*\n\n*Recovery Procedures: Removing the locket, or the personal effect inside the locket, will halt all effects of #047.*\n\n*Origin: #047 was originally found in a pawn shop. It seemed no one suspected its true nature before it was picked up by \\[REDACTED\\] in 2006.*\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest.\n\n“So she, she *looks* like Aunt Gigi,” I stuttered. “But… it’s not her.”\n\nThe air felt like lead. Every breath I took felt suffocating. *No wonder she was so easygoing, so okay with putting me in danger. She’d never been the most safety-conscious aunt, but I should have known. Should have known she’d never put me in any real danger.*\n\n*How long had she* not *been Aunt Gigi?*\n\n*Where was Aunt Gigi?*\n\n*Was she—*\n\n“What do we do now?” Kira asked.\n\nI sat there, every sense thrumming with nervous energy, the knocks on the door like the pounding in my brain. Pulsing, pounding, thrumming, the entire world shimmering.\n\n“We ambush her,” I said, finally. “As soon as she comes in, in the morning… we ambush her. Three against one.”\n\n“Ambush her with what? We don’t have any weapons,” Elias said.\n\n“Oh, but we do. We have an entire arsenal, right out there.” I glanced at the clock. “It’s almost four. We’ll flip through the manual, find what we can use.”\n\n“Shouldn’t we… like… get the police involved or something?” Elias asked.\n\n“We can. But they won’t believe in shapeshifting lockets, will they?” I asked.\n\n“Maybe if they see it…” Kira replied.\n\n“We’ll call them too. But we need to take the locket off her first. Or she’ll just convince them that she’s the real Aunt Gigi.”\n\nThe three of us glanced at each other.\n\n“Okay,” Kira said, some conviction in her voice. At least I’d convinced someone. Smelly Elly was still staring at me skeptically, eyebrows raised. “We ride at dawn.”\n\n“We ride at dawn,” I repeated.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI hefted #274 (the fireplace poker) in my hands. Kira pushed the #411 (the rocking chair) up to the front door, tossing the *DO NOT SIT HERE* sign. According to the manual, it would trap anyone who sat there for days, possibly weeks. Elias held #987 (a pair of high heels that would force the wearer to always tell the truth.)\n\n“There she is,” I whispered, as a figure stepped into the alleyway.\n\nWe held our breath as the key jangled in the lock. The doorknob turned—\n\nI came down with the poker.\n\nShe dodged out of the way like a cat. Then she swiped at me, grabbing my head in her large, claw-like hands.\n\n*“You little traitor,”* she whispered, her nails needling my cheeks. I felt warm blood drip down the side of my face.\n\n“Help,” I choked.\n\nElias grabbed the poker out of my hands. After a second of back and forth, he got her. The tines pierced her in the arm like a fleshy bit of steak. She screamed.\n\nKira and I wrestled her into the rocking chair—although it wasn’t much of a wrestle at the end, as she was quickly paralyzing. Her stiff, half-paralyzed limbs flailed as she fell into the seat. As soon as her rump hit the wood, she stuck like glue. She tried to scrabble up—the curved wooden rockers rattled against the wooden floor—but she was trapped.\n\n“What the—”\n\nElias bent down and yanked off her shoes. Peeled off her socks. Stuffed her feet into the tattered, cracked-leather high heels.\n\nI reached behind her and undid the necklace.\n\nAs soon as I did, her appearance began to melt and bubble and curdle like boiling milk. Until the thing before us was a skinny, frail woman with mean little eyes. I didn’t recognize her, but she looked… human. Not like one of the not-people that frequented my store.\n\n“You’re not my aunt.”\n\n“I’m not your aunt.” She looked horrified at what she’d just said. “What—what did you do to me?!” she shrieked.\n\n“Entity 987. Truth-telling shoes.”\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“Maude.”\n\n“How do you know Giselle?”\n\n“I worked for her for three years. Before the bitch fired me.”\n\n“Why did she fire you?”\n\n“I was stealing some of the wares. And some of her food.”\n\nMy heart dropped. The food-stealing employee… *she* was the one who’d orchestrated all this? Stolen the necklace, worn it to look like her? Not even one of the more supernatural not-people? Just this random woman?\n\n“… Why?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t report all the items to the Board. I sell the lethal ones on the black market for a ton of money.”\n\nMoney. That was always it, wasn’t it?\n\nI sucked in a deep breath, dreading the next question. “Where’s Giselle?”\n\nShe grinned crookedly. “In the fridge.”\n\nMy heart plummeted to the floor.\n\n“I hit her over the head with a hammer. Never saw it coming. Then I dismembered her, piece-by-piece, and locked her in her beloved fridge with all her beloved food.”\n\nMy mouth hung open. My heart pounded. Tears stung my eyes. I glanced at Kira and Elias—they, too, were staring wide-eyed down at Maude.\n\n“How… how could you?” I whispered.\n\n“It was easy. I just—”\n\n“Why hire Nadia?” Kira cut in.\n\n“Well, I thought she might be useful. Selling on the black market takes a lot of time, and I was falling behind on sales enough for the Board to notice. I knew Giselle hadn’t seen her in a few years, and wouldn’t pick up on the difference. So I figured…”\n\n*It can’t be true.*\n\nI ran through the store. Down the hall. Into the office.\n\nI yanked the fridge door open a crack, as far as it would go with the lock still attached.\n\nThe truth shoes did their job. There was a lock of hair—a bit of purpled flesh—everything portioned neatly in Ziploc bags, laid on top of each other like she was meal prepping, not disposing of a body.\n\nI collapsed onto the ground and began to sob, my tears stinging the wounds Maude had sliced into my cheeks.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe police requestioned Maude while she was still in the chair, and she told them everything. She was arrested and taken away, after the rocking chair released her. (The officers were quite confused when they tried to stand her up, but the chair remained fused to her butt.)\n\nI glared at her mean little eyes through the shop window, hoping that she would be served justice.\n\nKira and I run the shop now. Apparently Aunt Gigi’s will stated that, in the event of her death, the shop would be left to the current employees; which was Kira and me. So I guess this is our job now. Dealing with artifacts that may, or may not, kill us.\n\nIt’s definitely not how I imagined my life to go.\n\nBut life never turns out the way we expect, does it?"},"79":{"title":"The Cannibals of the Mountains","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdxqzk\/the_cannibals_of_the_mountains\/","flair":null,"author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\nRenato and I were hanging by a thread. The fast-paced life in São Paulo had drained us: our patience, our humor—even our silence. Everything was noise, lines, traffic, pressure. So when we saw that ad on the vacation rental website, it felt like a sign. *“Rustic house high up in the mountains, perfect for those seeking peace and isolation.”* Exactly what we needed.\n\nThe drive there was long and bumpy. By the time we left the asphalt and hit the dirt road, the sun was already beginning to set. We passed through thick forest, a few abandoned fields, and then... nothing. No houses, no human sounds. Just the wind and the song of birds I had never heard before.\n\nThe house was older than the pictures had shown, but it had a certain charm—sloped red-tile roof, wooden porch, a collapsed fence on one side. I opened the door and the smell hit right away: damp wood mixed with something else... hard to describe. A musty scent, like cloth stored in a basement. Renato made a joke, calling it “the smell of peace and quiet.”\n\nInside, the house was simple. A living room with an old couch, thick rug, a small kitchen with white cabinets. The bedrooms were upstairs, but one thing caught my eye immediately: an old, solid wood cabinet that didn’t match the others, which were modern and metallic. The wall behind it stood out too. It didn’t match the rest of the kitchen. It was wooden, while the others were made of brick and mortar. I ran my hand over it out of curiosity.  \n— “Weird wall,” I said to Renato.  \n— “You and your horror movies,” he laughed.  \nI let it go. It was just a wall.\n\nThat first night was quiet, which alone made the whole drive worth it. Used to horns, sirens, and street yelling, the forest silence was almost deafening. We went to bed early.\n\nI woke the next morning with *that feeling*. You know the one—like someone’s watching you, even when no one’s there. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and stepped onto the porch in my pajamas, trying to shake off the weight in my chest with the smell of trees and earth.\n\nThat’s when I noticed the footprints.  \nIn the soft dirt by the side of the house—human footprints. They led up to the living room window... and stopped. They didn’t return. Didn’t go further. Just stopped, as if whoever made them had vanished into thin air.  \nI called Renato. He tried to laugh it off.  \n— “Probably the caretaker.”  \n— “There is no caretaker.”  \n— “Maybe from an old guest.”  \nBut the prints were fresh. The earth was still dark and damp. Hard to ignore.\n\nThat night, we locked everything up. I checked the doors and windows twice. A third time, just to be sure.\n\nAt two in the morning, I woke up to a low sound coming from the kitchen. A slow creaking. Like a door being opened very carefully.\n\nI called Renato. He got up to check. Came back saying everything was fine—but I knew better. A small voice inside me told me to stay alert.\n\n \n\nThe next day, after breakfast, Renato and I decided to explore the area around the house. The mist still clung to the woods, but gradually, the sun tore through the white veil and revealed the landscape: hills covered in low brush, a few twisted trees, and a silence broken only by birdsong.\n\nIt was beautiful, I won’t lie. A silence that seeped into your skin. We walked slowly, hand in hand, saying little. It felt like the whole place was waiting for us to be quiet—to listen better.\n\nAfter about forty minutes of walking, we saw the “neighbor’s house” the ad had mentioned—the only one for miles, according to the owner. An old structure with mud walls and a crooked roof. There was a low fence and a wooden gate hanging by one hinge.\n\nThat’s when I saw him.\n\nA boy. Skinny, maybe 17 at most. Worn-out shirt, pants too big, dark hair falling across his face. He stood at the edge of the woods, about twenty yards from the house. Not moving. Just watching us.  \n— “You see him?” I asked.  \n— “Yeah. Is he... staring at us?” Renato squeezed my hand.\n\nThe boy didn’t say anything. Didn’t move. Just stared with an intensity that sent chills through me. It wasn’t curiosity. It felt like he was studying us.\n\nI felt exposed. Like we were naked in that landscape. The discomfort rose so fast we didn’t even need to speak—we turned and walked back the same way. Not running, but not looking back either.\n\nWhen the house appeared between the trees, my heart jumped. The door. It was slightly open.  \n— “Did you lock it?” I asked, already knowing the answer.  \n— “Yes.”\n\nWe approached slowly. The kitchen light was on. I swear I’d turned everything off before we left. Renato went in first. I stayed by the door, holding my breath.\n\nNothing seemed out of place. The living room looked the same, backpacks in the same corner. But something... I can’t explain.\n\nRenato searched every room, opened cabinets, looked behind doors. Nothing. No sign of a break-in.\n\nBut the feeling didn’t go away. The same one I’d had the night before. Like something in that house was watching us.\n\nAnd worse: now it knew we knew.\n\n \n\nThat night, I woke up with a start. The mattress was moving slowly. When I opened my eyes, I saw Renato getting up, stepping carefully on the wooden floor.\n\n— “Renato... what is it?” I murmured, still half-asleep.\n\nHe paused for a second, then whispered:  \n— “I think I heard something downstairs.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. I sat up, straining to hear what he had. Nothing. Just silence. But the way he said it killed any urge I had to argue.\n\nWe grabbed our jackets and went down slowly, one step at a time. When we turned the hallway corner, the kitchen light was on again.\n\nStanding at the edge of the room, it took us a few seconds to notice. Renato pointed at the floor, eyes wide. The floor was full of marks. Footprints. He knelt down and ran his hand across the dirty tiles.  \n— “Is this... mud?” I whispered.  \nThe muddy prints led straight to the wooden cabinet—the oldest one in the kitchen.  \nThe trail stopped there. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. I said nothing, just scanned the room, feeling that deep, cold fear you only feel when something’s *really* wrong.\n\nRenato slowly opened the cabinet, expecting... who knows what. But there was nothing—just plates, old pans, some cans of corn.  \nCarefully, he began tapping the sides of the cabinet with his knuckles. Solid wood... until he hit the back. The sound changed. Hollow.\n\nHe looked at me. “There’s something here.” That’s when we saw it—a barely noticeable groove in the wall beside it. He pulled hard and the wooden panel creaked, revealing a short door with a rusty old latch. Renato reached for it. “Don’t open it yet,” I said instinctively. “Let’s think. Let’s call someone…”\n\nRenato froze, hand still on the latch, as if struggling inside. I didn’t want to seem hysterical, but everything in me screamed *do not go further*. That’s when we heard it—a sound like a woman screaming.\n\n \n\nRenato yanked the latch. It cracked like a dry bone snapping. The door opened a few inches with a groan, and a strong smell rushed out. Something between stagnant water and rotting flesh. I recoiled instinctively, covering my face. My stomach turned.\n\nRenato turned on his phone’s flashlight and pointed it inside. It was a tunnel. Narrow, damp, the walls supported by wooden beams, lined with uneven stones and moss. The floor was dirt and mud, with fresh footprints mixed into the muck. It didn’t look like a basement—more like a coal mine.\n\n“This isn’t normal, Renato.” My voice was trembling. He nodded, but looked hypnotized. He crouched and went in, and I followed. The light swung across the walls like it was revealing secrets that didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThe tunnel branched off underground. We followed the one that spiraled downward for a few yards, ending at a wooden door reinforced with beams and chains. On the floor were marks, as if something heavy had been dragged to that spot. The air smelled stronger there—almost unbearable.\n\nRenato ran his hand along the doorknob. Locked. But there was a small gap between the door and the frame. He brought the flashlight closer, and I leaned beside him to peek inside.\n\nAnd that’s when we saw, for the first time, proof that something horrifying had happened there.\n\nThere were remains. Bones. Some small, others far too big to belong to animals. Torn fabric stained with dried blood. A chain hanging from a hook in the wall. A rusty bucket in the corner. We had no idea how long we stood there, paralyzed. But when we finally turned to go back through the tunnel—guided only by the weak phone flashlight—we were horrified to discover the passage we came through... was now closed.\n\n \n\nSomething heavy was blocking the path. Renato pushed hard, but it was useless.  \n\"What do we do now?\" I whispered, barely able to speak.  \nBefore he could answer, we heard voices coming from the dark tunnels behind us. Twisted laughter and the sound of footsteps in the mud. Renato turned off the flashlight, and we stood still in total darkness, listening to our own hearts pounding too loud.  \nWhen they noticed our presence, they began to shout and run toward us.  \nWithout thinking, we bolted through the tunnel, stumbling and hitting the dirt walls. We ran blind, guided only by the instinct to survive, trying to escape the maddened voices that seemed to close in from every side.\n\nThat’s when we found another door. Old wood, the lock nearly rotted through. We knocked, pushed, but it seemed locked. Behind us, the voices drew closer.  \nThe door creaked and suddenly opened. A small room, stinking of mold and rot. And inside, almost invisible in the dim light, was the boy we’d seen outside — thin, filthy, eyes wide open. Without a word, he made a quick gesture for silence.  \nWe rushed inside, and he quietly closed the door, sliding a piece of wood across it to act as a lock. From the other side, we heard our pursuers arrive and start banging, trying to break it down.  \nThe boy pointed to another exit — a trapdoor hidden under a pile of torn clothes.  \nWith hurried gestures, he guided us. We crawled through a tight passage that led into the kitchen of the house. There, we saw a woman — his mother, I assumed — with her back to us, cooking something on a wood stove. She was humming a children’s song off-key, unaware of our presence.\n\nWith quiet steps, we crossed the room. The boy opened the back door. The cold night air hit us like a slap. And we escaped into the yard, running without looking back.  \nHe stayed at the threshold, motionless, watching as we disappeared into the darkness.\n\nWe ran through the yard, not looking back. The tall grass cut our legs, branches scratched our arms, but the only thing that mattered was getting out. Renato chose not to turn on his phone flashlight again so we wouldn't give away our position. The moonlight barely lit the path, but even in the dark we could see our car parked at the front of the house, just as we’d left it.  \nRenato pulled the keys from his pocket and tried to unlock the car, but it didn’t work.  \n\"Damn it…\" he muttered, pressing the button over and over.  \nThat’s when we noticed all four tires were slashed and the hood was slightly open — the battery was gone. They wanted to keep us trapped.\n\nThe voices and footsteps were getting closer. We could clearly hear more than one — several — coming toward us. They shouted nonsense, some laughing like kids playing tag.  \n\"Run! Run!\" Renato yelled.  \nWe left the car and dove into the dense underbrush, heading the opposite way from the voices. The cold night air burned our lungs with each frantic breath. Thorns tore our clothes, but the adrenaline kept us from feeling any pain.  \nAfter what felt like an eternity of blind running, we saw something ahead: metal structures reflecting the faint light. As we got closer, we saw what it was — an empty lot filled with old, abandoned cars swallowed by weeds.  \nWe didn’t think twice. We began opening doors, trying to find a vehicle that could still save us.\n\nMost were just junk: rust, rotted seats, broken steering wheels.  \nThen Renato whispered, \"Here! This one!\"  \nIt was an old car, but intact. And miraculously, the key was still in the ignition.  \nWithout hesitation, he turned the key. The engine coughed once, twice… then caught, sputtering but alive.  \nAs Renato revved the engine to keep it going, I saw through the broken windows of the junkyard — shadows approaching. Three of them, running, waving their arms like rabid animals.  \n\"Go! Go! Go!\" I shouted.  \nRenato floored it. The car jerked forward, bumping into old shells of metal and wood. As we reached the dirt road, we could already see some of the pursuers coming out of the brush, their faces twisted with rage.\n\nWe left that hell behind. The house, the tunnel, the pursuers — all disappearing in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the darkness. But the car didn’t make it much farther. The engine died, leaving us stranded in the middle of the woods and night. Still, it was far enough to get away from that nightmare.\n\nAfter hours of walking through the forest, exhausted, filthy, and still terrified, we finally reached the main road. We flagged down the first car we saw, and the driver, seeing our condition, didn’t hesitate to take us to the nearest police station.  \nSitting under the cold lights of the lobby, we recounted everything we had been through: the isolated house, the tunnels, the pursuers, the mute boy who helped us. As we spoke, the officers exchanged glances — some serious, others with a mix of disbelief and unease.  \nDespite everything, they agreed to go with us to the place, now in broad daylight, to verify our story.\n\nWe arrived at the house, now bathed in sunlight. From a distance, it looked like just another old farmhouse. But as the officers inspected the area, they began to find signs: trails, debris, fresh marks in the dirt.  \nInside, the scene showed signs of a rushed abandonment — still-warm pots, clothes strewn about, inner doors flung open. In the tunnels, the officers found disturbing evidence: personal belongings from several people, IDs, broken phones, torn clothes.  \nOne of the officers muttered while examining the items:  \n\"We’ve suspected that family for years... The Hobolds.\"  \nThey explained that the family, of German descent, had long been investigated for the disappearances of tourists in the region, but there had never been enough proof. Now, with our testimony and the evidence found, they could finally act.\n\nAs I got into the police car, I looked back one last time. For a moment, I thought I saw the silhouette of the mute boy at the window, watching us. I felt a bitter mix of relief and sorrow. He had saved us... but was still trapped in that nightmare."},"80":{"title":"The man in the window","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdyuvh\/the_man_in_the_window\/","flair":null,"author":"ToolisticToolian","selftext":"I’ve never thought of myself as someone who scares easily. I’ve worked night shifts for years, walked home through sketchy areas, and lived in some weird neighborhoods. You get used to ignoring things that feel a little… off. Your mind plays tricks when you're tired. At least, that’s what I used to believe.\n\nLast December changed that.\n\nI’d just gotten off a long shift—I'm a nurse, and night shifts can either be completely dead or absolutely insane. That night was the latter. I was drained, both mentally and physically. When I finally got home around 3:30 a.m., all I wanted was tea and silence. My apartment is on the second floor of an old duplex, just outside the city. It’s quiet, with mostly older residents and not a lot of activity at night.\n\nOne of my habits is leaving the blinds open in my living room. The big window faces the street, and there’s an old-fashioned streetlamp right outside that gives off this dull orange glow. It makes the place feel warm, lived in—even when I’m alone.\n\nThat night, as I sat on my couch sipping tea, I glanced out the window.\n\nThat’s when I noticed it.\n\nAcross the street is this old Victorian house. Beautiful place, but it’s been vacant for months. The previous owners moved out after a pipe burst and ruined most of the ground floor. Ever since, it's just sat there—quiet, dark, lifeless.\n\nBut tonight, a light was on.\n\nNot a bright one, more like a flickering glow. Candlelight. That’s the only way I can describe it. It looked dim and unstable, almost like firelight. I leaned closer to the glass, frowning. That’s when I saw him.\n\nThere was a man standing in the upstairs window of that house.\n\nHe wasn’t moving. Just standing there, still as stone, facing my direction. I couldn’t see his face clearly—just the outline of a tall, thin figure in dark clothing. At first, I thought it was a mannequin or a trick of the light. But then he moved.\n\nHe leaned forward.\n\nSlowly. Deliberately. Like he was trying to get a better look at me.\n\nI felt my stomach drop. Something about it felt wrong—not just eerie, but threatening. I’ve seen enough weird behavior to know when something’s off, and this was deeply off.\n\nAnd then… he was gone.\n\nOne blink and the figure had vanished. No movement, no fading away. Just there one second, gone the next. The light went out too, like someone blew out a candle.\n\nI stared at the empty window for a long time. Tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was a squatter. Maybe kids snuck in with a flashlight. Maybe I was so tired I imagined it.\n\nI was almost convinced—until I turned to pick up my tea again.\n\nThat’s when I noticed movement in the reflection of my own window.\n\nIt was fast. A blur behind me.\n\nI spun around immediately, heart pounding.\n\nNo one there.\n\nI stood in the middle of my living room, lights on, silence thick around me. I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, the hallway. Doors locked. Nothing out of place.\n\nBut then I looked back at the window.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw them.\n\nTwo handprints. Faint, greasy smudges. Pressed against the outside of the glass.\n\nSecond floor. No balcony. No fire escape. No trees near the window. Just two handprints, like someone had been leaning in… watching me.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. I sat on the couch, lights on, staring at the window until the sun came up.\n\nThe next morning, I called my landlord, told him I had a family emergency, and asked if I could break the lease. I didn’t even give a full explanation. I just needed out.\n\nI moved out two weeks later. Haven’t been back to that street since. I still don’t know who or what I saw in that window—or how those handprints got there.\n\nAll I know is this: I never leave my blinds open at night anymore. And if you ever see something watching you from a window… don’t stare back.\n\nBecause sometimes, it stares back harder.\n"},"81":{"title":"The Shed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke77ex\/the_shed\/","flair":"Series","author":"Top-Trainer1726","selftext":"I awoke to a sliver of light, coming through a crack in the boarded window. It must have been morning, or afternoon I have lost all concept of time. My eyes adjusted to the dim light. I was in a shed again. the Small puddle of bile, reeked when i realized I threw up again last night. in this shed, was a old dirty mattress, a dirty pillow. a thin blanket with holes in one corner. in the other corner is a desk, with a broken chair along with a bucket used to release myself, the desk always had a fresh tray of food, and a fresh flower. Although I never knew how they put it there. I stood up and patted my xtra large T-shirt that was covered in dirt and bile.\n\nI walked over to the desk. I heard the clinking of the chain attached to my leg as i walked to the desk and scarfed down the food. it was pancakes, eggs, and orange juice today. on the wall was a calendar but it was obviously the wrong date and year. I looked at the small marks next to it that I dug into the wall. twenty one days in this shed, I've tried multiple times to escape but the chains are too thick and the door is boarded up now. The camera in the corner watches my every move. \n\nI walk back to the mattress and pick up the books next to it. I've already read them multiple times but I don't have much to do in here. I read a little and then pace the 4 foot by 8 foot square shed. every day is the same.  I sit at the desk and pick at the petals of the fresh flower. a pile of dead dried petals sit on the ground next to the desk. I decide to sing like I do all the time, then i hear a scream. \"You cant keep me here, I don't belong here.\" a voice says I rush to the window and look through the crack. I see the other 10 sheds, and hear \"LET ME OUT\" must be the new girl. theres now 10 of us in 10 different sheds. \n\n\"theres no use, stop screaming\" the other girl says. \"LET ME OUT\" the new girl screamed. then the eight other girls screamed back. they did this to mock the newbies. to show that no matter how loud you scream, no one is coming for you. I just sit there in silence and fear. knowing I was the first girl. I was all alone at one point Screaming so much i ripped my vocal cords. that was twenty two days ago now. Girl #2 showed up on day 5. Girl #3 on day 7, Girl 4 on 10, girl 5 on day 13, girl number 6 on day 15, so on and so on till now. twenty two and girl number 10 is here.  I tried to talk again but like always the hoarseness of my chords just let out a light screech. the other girls knew i was here. i just assumed they assumed i didn't speak. I went back to my desk. \"LET ME OUT LET ME GO\" the girl kept screaming through out the day. day became night and eventually. I fell asleep. the next day, I woke up and repeated my routines. read, pace, read, pace, sit eat. everyday was the same as the last. I had no idea when or if we would be let go.  \n\n10 days later. \n\n\n\nI awoke, to the sound of a dog barking, and a couple talking. \n\n\n\n\"babe, look at those cabins\" the woman said \n\n\n\n\"oh my they're so cute,\" she said as she walked closer. \n\n\n\nthe new girl almost screamed, but before she could the current started. silencing us. unable to scream. The dog however, started crying. he barked at the Sheds. kept barking. but the couple kept walking. I looked out the small opening to try to see them, but couldn't see them. Then \"HELP US\" came from the other sheds. hoping the couple would hear us. I heard the dog bark again then I heard a yelp, I knew even if the couple did hear us. they were gone, I started to panic, what if they had a phone, what if they sent a picture of the sheds to someone. I realized it was a long shot, but maybe someone heard us. we would be saved.  I would be able to go home, I would be okay. thirty three days here or more. the little glimpse of hope got to me. I decided it was time to try and break free of this place. I looked around the area to see if there was anything to get out. I knew I couldn't just try to escape. I was being watched by someone. \n\nI decided to break my routine. I looked around the shed. I took the inventory. \n\nThree warn books, a calendar, A tray, a bucket, an old blanket, a glass vase. I had to get out of the shackle around my leg. I had to get out of the door or window.  I looked at the inventory.  I looked at the mattress. i decided to take the book and pretend to read facing away from the camera. i took the vase and broke it. \" What was that\" i heard one of the girls say. I used the glass to cut open the mattress. I put the rest of the small glass under the mattress. I cut the spring out of the mattress. a thin metal thing but I used the spring and tried to flatten some of it out. \n\non the shackle was a lock, I didn't know how to pick it. but I had to try. I knew enough to put two pieces of metal in it. but no luck. I decided to try other methods after hours of trying to pick the lock. i hid everything under the pillow. and walked away. I got up and walked to the window to look out. I didn't see anything at first. but then i saw the feet of the couple and the dog. which means they were dead.  i walked back to the desk and looked around for anything else I could use. i felt around the back, and felt a loose nail in the wall. I pulled the desk out a little and pulled the nail.  The nail came out. it was a long nail. I went back to the things and tired to think of how to escape. I scanned the room again I felt around the floor. anything that could help me. i felt a loose floorboard, but couldn't get a hold of it. \n\nby now it was getting dark. i decided to go to bed, hopfully to get some sleep.  the next day, i went to the window, i took the nail and the old tray which was hidden under my bed.  I swung the tray at the window. Nothing. I swung again. nothing. the windows didnt break. i swung again. this time tho, the window broke. i took the blanket and wrapped it around my hand. i punched the broken window. It broke all the way this time but the wood boards were still there. the other girls must have heard me cause i heard banging. they somehow did the same thing as me, breaking the windows. \n\nI tried to push at the board, it was a little loose. then remembered i wouldnt be able to leave unless I got unshackled. I sat back down, worked at the lock with the nail and the bent spring. i kept trying for hours until I heard a click. I almost didn't believe it at first, but the lock came loose. I was free, i went back to the window. i pushed the board, again. i hit it as hard as i could the nails were coming out. I went again and again. until the board came loose and fell. I went to the desk and grabbed the chair. the window was just big enough to get out of. I squeezed through it, preparing myself for the fall. I managed to get out and then Crack. i landed on my shoulder, i screamed but this time it came out. the wail broke out. I was out, i was free. I walked to the shed over I hear movement in the cabin. i try the door and to my surprise. it opens, the girl inside screams. \n\nI get a tap on my shoulder, and i turn around. \n\n\n\nI feel hands around my eyes, the goggles lifted from my face. the vision is blinded by the neon lights and the room, I was now in what looks like an arcade. \"babe, you were in that game for almost an hour. but you beat the High Score by 1 minute.  You escaped the Shed!  The room had 9 other booths, with 9 other girls hooked up to the goggles, the girl that screamed, had her goggles taken off shortly after. since she escaped with the help of me opening the door. \n\n\"it was just a game? it felt so real, oh my goodness that was intense. it felt so real\" I repeated,  I started to get a grasp onto the reality again and I remember now,  The acid they give you makes it feel even more real. I started walking out of the booth. ready to leave, then I felt the familiar cold metallic cuff around my leg. I looked down as I began to panic again a piece of paper floated down, landing in front of me. \n\non the piece of paper. \n\n\n\nLEVEL 2: THE ARCADE STARTS NOW. "},"82":{"title":"My brother believed he was protecting us from something he called “The Patterned Ones.” I thought he was delusional.

Not exactly.\n\nBut he believed he could see what no one else could—that the rest of us were too distracted or conditioned or blind.\n\nIt started with harmless patterns. Coincidences, he said. Only they weren’t.\n\nAnd when we lost him, it wasn’t like he died. It was more like he… evaporated.\n\nOr maybe, like a virus, he just moved on to a new host.\n\n⸻\n\nDan wasn’t always like this.\n\nHe used to be the kind of person who lit up a room—the favorite kid, the class clown, the ball of energy that made family dinners feel like a stage show.\n\nAfter high school, most of his friends went off to college. Dan stayed behind. He said he needed time to figure things out, but what he really meant was that he didn’t know who he was without an audience. And when the spotlight vanished, he started to create one of his own.\n\nHe’d tell us about a new job, how well things were going. But the stories never quite lined up. Different job titles. Made-up coworkers. He just wanted to seem like his life was full—like it mattered.\n\n⸻\n\nIt didn’t start with anything big. No voices. No threats. Just… patterns.\n\nHe said he kept seeing the same car. A rust-colored SUV. Then again outside the store. Again at the gas station. He started writing down license plates.\n\nThen it was too many red cars in a block. Too many silver sedans in one parking lot.\n\nHe spent hours with the radio on, scanning between stations like a codebreaker. He’d only stop for a second—just long enough to catch a phrase or half a sentence.\n\n“They’re stitching it together,” he told me once. “One station starts the sentence, the next one finishes it.”\n\nHe believed someone—or something—was trying to reach him through the gaps. Through the noise.\n\n⸻\n\nWe kept telling ourselves it would pass. That if we forced it, we’d only make it worse.\n\nThen Dan showed up at our house out of nowhere.

In the temp folder. You think I don’t check the temp folder?”\n\nMy dad stepped in between us. Like he was shielding me from a dog.\n\nDan’s lips twitched. “They’re using you now. You. Her. The routers were just the start. The light pulses. The searches—”\n\nHe turned on our mom.\n\n“You used the search engine. They feed on that.”\n\nHe didn’t yell. He barked.

And yet, I beg you: anyone reading this, try to remember — has a faceless shadow ever visited your dreams? Because it may do to you what it did to me.\n\nI’ll start from the beginning. Lately — though I can’t say exactly how long — I’ve had memory lapses. At first, they were trivial. I’d forget where I parked my car, and I brushed it off. Then I began forgetting the way to my own apartment, my name, and — God help me — even my family. Each day I woke in this house, and though everything was familiar, it felt foreign, like someone had laid out my things for me.\n\nI feared I was developing dementia. I was ready to see a doctor — if not for last night. God… that evening, I found one of the notebooks. It was behind my bed. I swear I never put it there. But I opened it. The first pages were written in my own hand — and yet I had no memory of writing them. I read: “My brother died in a car crash. Absurd. Accidental. A man ran a red light while texting and killed him. I had to identify the body. He was the only family I had left. Goodbye, little brother. I love you.”\n\nI couldn't breathe. A panic attack gripped me. My legs gave out, I gasped for air, and my heart lurched between eruption and stillness. I swear on my life: I did not remember this. Shaking, I turned more pages. Memories — in my own handwriting — but not mine. I thought Alzheimer’s had devoured my brain. I decided to keep journals, to not lose myself completely.\n\nThen I came to an entry that paralyzed me with primal fear. It followed a passage about my drinking binge — after losing my job, my brother, my will to live. The next page read: “I was lying on the couch, staring at the static of the TV. I couldn’t rise, couldn’t turn the damn thing off. Then the air grew heavier. I breathed through cotton. The room tilted. And in the doorway… it stood. A dark figure. Gaunt. Neither man nor beast. Towering shadow. Its face — blurred. I tried to reconstruct it instinctively, but couldn’t, as if it was never meant to be seen. Its voice didn’t come from its mouth. It buzzed in my head, low and distorted like radio static. It said it could take away what haunted me — take away all my pain. No soul, no blood, no price was asked. That night, I was too broken. And so… I agreed. The funeral. The phone call. My brother’s disfigured jaw. I gave all those memories to the creature. And now, waking up, I feel light. Alive. Calm.Happy. The echoes are fading. I can’t remember why I was ever sad. I’ll leave this notebook somewhere, so I never return to it again.”\n\nTerror seized me. I had erased my own brother. I stared at the notebook in horror, sweat dripping from my brow. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I tried to remember his name — but the memory slipped away, like a cruel game. I sat for hours. Nothing came. I flipped through the notebook again. None of it rang true to my mind — the dead brother, the panic attack in college, the missing cat — nothing. My head was empty.\n\nThen the thought struck me: Had I given away all my painful memories to this being? I nearly vomited.\n\nBut I realized I no longer remembered the good either. My only memories now were of confusion — \"Where is my home?\" \"What is my name?\" Nothing else. The more I thought, the more yesterday slipped through my fingers, and even this morning blurred. I stumbled into the kitchen, dizzy, trembling with dread.\n\nIn the trash, another notebook.\n\nI tore into it like it held fragments of my soul. Pages were ripped out. Some made no sense. Some were just drawings: doors, corridors, eyes, the tall faceless figure. But on one page — a chilling entry: “Strange dreams haunt me. Not quite nightmares — but suffocating all the same. I stand in a corridor, lined with doors. Behind each one is me — but different: crying, screaming, paralyzed. Every dream ends the same. I turn around. And it’s there. Smiling… That smile feels familiar, as if I’ve seen it before. I gave it another memory. Don’t know which number. The one about the assholes in college who mocked me. Soon I’ll forget them, too. And… God… How good it feels, living without the weight of these horrors. I never want to go back.”\n\nTerror crawled beneath my skin, nestled into my bones. Reality unraveled. My life, this world — none of it felt real. I tore my home apart. Found notebooks in drawers, under the bed, even in a vent. It was as if I’d hidden parts of myself everywhere, knowing I’d forget.\n\nPages missing. Doodles. Fragments of joy. Then behind the radiator — another notebook. One page: “Something strange again. Woke in the night. A woman stared at me, eyes full of horror. She called me Ben.” Ben… But in another diary, I called myself John. I ran to the bathroom, hands shaking, opened the mirror — and stared.\n\nI didn’t recognize the face. Eyes too wide. Too calm. I doubled over in pain and vomited into the toilet. There — another notebook under the tub. Again, ripped pages. A couple lines survived: “You gave it your name. You gave it your face. Stop making deals. These aren’t just memories. It’s taking YOU.”\n\nI flung it away and stared at the ceiling. What’s left of me? I think I gave away my mother. My childhood. I vaguely recall green was once my favorite color — but now, when I look at a green towel, something feels wrong.\n\nIt’s been… maybe 30 hours. I’m trying not to sleep. If I do, it’ll come. And I’ll give up even this. Hours ago, two memories pierced my mind like ice: Hiding with my little brother from our drunken father and standing at my brother’s funeral. How much I’ve sacrificed for peace. Dear God, I’ll soon fall asleep. I’ll forget the notebooks. The memories. Myself.\n\nBut… there’s one more thing.\n\nIn this sleepless stretch, I feel it. In the house. Watching from corners. Humming songs I may have once known. Soon, it’ll end. And the scariest part?\n\nAs I type this, two visions form: I’m a child in the closet again. No brother. My father screams my name — but I can’t understand it. The closet door opens. It’s not my father. It’s me — from before the deals. He looks at me like a corpse. Behind him… it smiles. Another one, I’m at my brother’s funeral. But this time… he’s standing. Crying. And I’m the one in the coffin.\n\nPlease — don’t make deals if you see it.\n\nEven your worst memories are part of you.

Bone-like clicks tapped out irregular rhythms from dark corners. Somewhere distant, something let out a gurgling, broken howl that chilled me straight to the marrow.\n\nI didn’t want to know what other horrors were stalking these halls.\n\nAs we pushed deeper into the facility, we stuck to the walls. More than once, we hid behind corners as the footsteps of the cloaked figures ran by. We cut through an unlit storage corridor, only to come face-to-face with something. \n\nA hulking, four-legged shape, slick and bristling with matted fur, crouched at the end of the hallway. Its long, malformed jaws hung slightly ajar, a viscous string of saliva connecting its teeth, while two pale, lidless eyes locked onto us.\n\nIt didn’t hesitate. Neither did we.\n\nWe bolted, sprinting until our lungs burned, ducking into the first room we could find and slamming the door behind us. I pressed my ear to the metal, listening as heavy, wet footsteps slowed and eventually drifted past, the creature's ragged breathing fading into the distance.\n\nRelief hadn’t even finished washing over me when I noticed Ryan wasn’t moving. \n\nHe stood by the far wall, staring intently at an empty shelf. “Damon,” his voice was quiet but curious. “There’s door hinges behind this shelf.” I walked over to him. “Maybe there's a way out behind it.” \n\nTogether, we shoved the rusted metal aside, and behind it, hidden beneath decades of dust and rot, was a narrow, corroded door. We forced it open, the hinges screaming in protest, and stepped inside.\n\nThe air was stale and cold.\n\nRows of monitors lined the walls, flickering between static, night-vision feeds, and distorted thermal camera views of rooms. Some screens showed figures—human shapes, barely more than shadows, strapped to operating tables. Others displayed cages, some empty, some not.\n\nThe desks were littered with files—some thick with pages of incomprehensible data, others displaying grotesque anatomical sketches.\n\nRyan stepped up to a terminal. He stared at the wall of monitors, eyes scanning. He wasn’t saying anything, just… taking it all in. I moved closer. “What is this place?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. \n\nJust stood there, still as stone. One screen showed a wide-angle shot of the hallway we had just come from. Another displayed a cell. A figure inside, hunched and unmoving. I caught a glimpse of Ryan's reflection in the monitor. His skin was paler than before. \n\nClammy. \n\nHis right hand was trembling—not from fear, but from something deeper. His veins had gone black, like ink was running under his skin.\n\n“Ryan…” I stepped toward him. He didn’t face me. Just shook his head. “Damon. This whole facility is for **\\[R̵͘E̴͠D̶͝A̶͘C̴̀T̷͠É̵D̸̕\\]**. The file I read earlier was full of people’s names.”\n\nI felt something cold settle in my chest.\n\nRyan turned to me, finally, and I saw how tired he looked. Not just physically but, like something inside him had already accepted the worst. However, he was still trying to hold on. “Listen,” he said. “You need to keep going.”\n\n“What? No. No way. We’re getting out together.” He tried to smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s too late for me.” My stomach dropped. “Don’t say that.”\n\n“I blacked out back there, Damon,” he said softly. “When I… when I killed that thing. I don’t even remember doing it. I just remember its—”\n\n“It was self-defense—”\n\n“No.” He cut me off. “You saw me. I didn’t look human right?”\n\nThere was silence between us for a moment. \n\nHeavy. \n\nCrushed under the weight of something unspeakable.\n\nHe stepped over to the terminal and started typing. “If I’m going out, I’m at least taking this place down with me.”\n\n“You’re not doing this,” I said, panic rising. “We can find help, we can fix it—”\n\nHe turned sharply. His eyes were glassy, almost colorless, but there was something behind them. \n\nNot rage. Not sorrow.\n\nBut resolve.\n\n“You have to go,” he said. “Before I become something I can’t come back from.” \n\nMy throat closed up.\n\nAnd then I saw it—the faintest ripple under the skin of his neck, something moving just beneath the surface. He saw me looking but he didn’t flinch.\n\n“Please,” he whispered. \n\nI didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want to leave him. But when he turned back to the console and hit **Enter**, the lights above us flickered and a door behind me hissed open—my only way forward. I stared at him one last time.\n\nHe didn’t turn around.\n\nJust kept typing, even as his hand started to spasm and twitch. I forced myself to walk through the door. Once I was through, the door slammed closed.\n\nI was alone again.\n\nI stumbled forward into a tunnel. The air was damp and foul, thick with rot. After walking for what felt like a mile. I collapsed against the wall and slid down to the ground. The darkness felt alive, like it was pressing in on me.\n\nI waited. \n\nPraying Ryan would follow. But I knew it was in vain. Just as the silence began to feel unbearable, I heard—slow, wet footsteps, echoing from the corridor I had just been in.\n\nHope flooded me. “Could that be Ryan,” I thought, pushing myself upright.\n\nBut before I could even turn—“Damon,” a voice whispered. Right behind me.\n\nI froze.\n\nIt was a voice I recognized but haven’t heard in years.\n\nIt was my mother’s.\n\nEvery hair on my body stood on end. The temperature dropped like the air had been sucked out of the tunnel. “Damon,” it said again—gentle, coaxing. The way she used to say my name when I had nightmares as a kid.\n\nBut this wasn’t a dream.\n\nI hadn’t heard her voice in years. She had gone missing when I entered high school. Tears welled in my eyes. I couldn’t move. My body wouldn’t let me. The thing behind me—whatever it was—kept repeating my name. The cadence was right, but the voice sounded more raspy, older.\n\nI clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. I didn’t turn around. I wouldn’t. Because I convinced myself that whatever was behind me… it wasn’t my mother.\n\nThe wet footsteps were getting closer.\n\nMy stomach turned as I staggered back, my heel slipping on the damp floor. \n\nIn that moment, I made a choice: whatever was imitating my mother had to be better than the thing coming.\n\nI spun around and faced the dark. She was standing there. And—for a second—I forgot where I was.\n\nIt was her. \n\nActually her. \n\nNot a hallucination. Not some mimicry. Her same kind eyes. Her same half-smile. I choked trying to swallow but the grief cracked open like a dam. \n\nI fell apart. \n\nMy dad and I spent months searching. Putting up flyers. Hoping. Pretending. Slowly learning to live around the void, rather than confront it. It was easier to leave her there—a ghost in old photographs, a voice locked away in fading memories—than to admit the truth: that she was never coming back.\n\nBut here she was. Behind me.\n\n“Damon,” she whispered again. I swallowed the lump rising in my throat. I couldn’t look at her. I wouldn’t. I tried to speak, but before I could even shape her name—the sound of something wet and heavy shuffled behind me. A gurgling moan snapped me out of my daze.\n\nI didn’t think. I couldn’t. \n\nI bolted—past the woman who looked like my mother, past whatever illusion or mercy I might’ve imagined—down the tunnel, into the dark. \n\nAnd I didn’t look back.\n\nI ran down the tunnel until I saw the glow of natural light. “I’m so close to being out of this hell hole!\" I gasped, pushing through the searing pain in my chest, my body screaming for rest. \n\nI didn’t care. I had to make it. I had to make it for them. Derek, who sacrificed himself being bait. Ryan, who deep down, I knew wasn’t coming back. Their sacrifices wouldn’t be in vain.\n\nI was getting closer and closer to the light. I could smell the fresh air. Freedom was so close I could taste it. Just as I was about to emerge into the light, everything went black.\n\nI was disoriented, my vision blurry. When my sight cleared up, I was lying on a bed. In a dark room. I sat up too fast, my head spinning. \n\nMy hands clutched at the sheets beneath me—familiar fabric. My stomach twisted. Slowly, I turned my head and scanned the room.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nThis was my room. \n\nMy room. \n\nThe same posters. The same desk. My old lamp, my worn-out chair. My laptop, its screen glowing softly in the dimness. I sucked in a shaky breath. \"There’s no way that was all a dream… right?\"\n\nA sudden thought struck me.\n\n\"Wait—if this was a dream, then Derek and Ryan should be fine!\" I threw off the covers and scrambled to my laptop. My hands shaking as I moved to open Discord. I scrolled up and down my friends list—nothing. My chest tightened as I manually typed in their usernames.\n\n***User not found***.\n\nFrantically, I searched my room for my phone. I found it on the nightstand and snatched it up. The screen glowed in the darkness. My stomach dropped as there was one solitary message sitting on the lock screen.\n\n\"*Thank you,* **D̷͓̹̠͓̑͘̕͜A̸͙͙̙̍͆̄̈́M̵͙̗͆̓̚Ȍ̶̝͇̾̀N̸̨̍̿͒͝**\\*..\\*\"\n\n**> INITIATING TERMINATION PROTOCOL . . .**  \n\n**> target: \/stor███\/sess█\\_267_damon.l██**  \n\n**> SYSTEM CONTROL: termination\\_complete\\_█████**  \n\n**\\[ CONNECTION CLOSED \\]**  \n\n**> . . . awaiting next subject.**"},"85":{"title":"Old homes make old noises","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdhgw7\/old_homes_make_old_noises\/","flair":null,"author":"Saturdead","selftext":"I don’t remember much about living with both of my parents. My very first memory is that of my mother sitting in a sunchair on the front porch, listening to the radio, napping behind her wide sunglasses. I was sitting next to her with a pink dino plushie, quietly playing. I would look up at her and she’d be so still - as if paralyzed by the sun. I remember imagining her never moving again. That she would stay in that chair forever, never to play with me.\n\nBut as soon as I felt that sad little tug in my heart, she’d rustle from her sleep and comfort me. She was right there. Everything was okay.\n\nFor now.\n\n \n\nI don’t remember their separation, or why it happened. I was very young. My mother was moving out, and they decided I was to stay with my dad. There was never a big fight. No screaming. Just four large suitcases loaded into a red Toyota, a kiss on the cheek, and a wave goodbye. That was it. Like she was going to the store. I was too young to understand, but I knew I should be sad. I could feel it.\n\nShe wanted to visit, but she lived on the other side of the country. She would send me postcards and presents, but I didn’t get to see her. My father met a new woman, and while I wouldn’t call her ‘mom’, she turned into it in everything but name. It’s just how these stories go sometimes.\n\nBut things are rarely so simple. I learned that the year I turned 12.\n\n \n\nMy father passed away in an accident. They pulled me out of school to tell me, and it felt like falling into a nightmare. You start to question everything. Every sensation becomes unreal as you look for anything to convince you it’s a dream. I couldn’t fathom it.\n\nAfter that, things went fast. My stepmother fought to get custody of me, but we didn’t have the papers. I wasn’t technically adopted. We’d talked about it, but we never went through with it. As such, the next in line to care for me was my biological mother – on the other side of the country. They contacted her, fully expecting her to relinquish custody.\n\nBut that’s not what happened. She said yes. So I was pulled out of school, had my room packed up, and sent across the country. Wyoming to Florida.\n\n \n\nBy the time I got there I was still in a daze. It had all gone by so fast, and I had a hard time adjusting. It was one thing being told that everyone loves you and wants to care for you, but it’s another feeling entirely when you see your life being put into boxes. You get some perspective, and it’s a strange perspective to grasp at that age.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I arrived at my mother’s house near Crystal River was a sunchair. Not the same one she’d had back at our house when I was little, but the same kind. There was also a little table with a battery-powered radio and an ashtray. I didn’t remember that she smoked, but then again, I barely remembered her at all.\n\nWhen she came running out of the house, it was hard to see her as ‘mom’. To me she was just ‘Aileen’. Even with the sunglasses and the outstretched arms, she looked nothing like I remembered her. Still, she swept me up, kissed me, and assured me.\n\n“It’s gonna be okay, baby girl,” she sobbed. “It’s all gonna be okay.”\n\n \n\nIt was an old house, much older than the one we’d lived in. Two floors. Every room had these wooden panels that looked like they’d topple over from a stiff breeze. It was clean and well-kept, but there were certain spots and corners that had a slight tinge of mildew. Lots of pictures on the walls, mostly of herself, but a few of me and dad as well. No other men, it seemed. A couple of friends perhaps.\n\n“We’re gonna have so much fun,” she assured me. “I’ll show you all around town. You know you can swim with manatees here?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “Read it in an article.”\n\n“Well ain’t that exciting, huh?”\n\nShe showed me my room, talking about everything and nothing. I could tell she was nervous, but I couldn’t fault her for trying to keep a straight face. She could probably tell I wasn’t okay. Then again, would I ever be?\n\n \n\nThose first few days are a blur. I had a room with a nice bed. She helped me put up my posters and connect my laptop to the internet. It was just a shitty wireless connection, but it was better than nothing. We didn’t get great reception out there, something about being too close to the coast. It wasn’t really the middle of nowhere, there was a pretty lively neighborhood, but it wasn’t the most modern area.\n\nAileen was happy to show me around. She introduced me to everyone, waving happily, and tried to make me feel welcome. She would ask me about everything from favorite subjects in school to favorite music. We would go to the movies, we would hang out at the park, go swimming, all kinds of stuff. But it all just felt hollow, in a way. Like it wasn’t real life.\n\nSchool was different too. I mean, it had to be. It was a new class, with new people – it couldn’t be the same. And being new is a coin flip; you’re either everyone’s favorite or a social pariah. I ended up, somehow, as both.\n\n \n\nI remember coming home one day after living with Aileen for about a month. I was tired. I’d been spending some time with some new friends I met in English class, while dodging some catty know-it-alls who kept bugging me during lunch. It was a social minefield, and coming home to my safe space felt like recharging a battery.\n\nI put on some music and danced around the room. But after only a couple of seconds, a picture on the wall came down. A framed photo of me and mom from when I was small. It crashed onto the floor, but the glass didn’t break. I jumped, almost dropped my headphones, and settled down. I carefully hung it back up on the nail and stepped away. I must’ve moved too much. The house was old, and I kept forgetting that.\n\nAs I turned back to my laptop, the picture fell again. This time I was barely moving at all. I put the picture up a third time and looked closely. I didn’t move.\n\n \n\nAs I looked, I saw the nail in the wall being pushed out.\n\nAnd for a third time, the picture came crashing onto the floor. This time, the glass broke.\n\n \n\nI didn’t know what to make of it. Maybe there was mold or something behind the wallpaper. I couldn’t smell anything, even when I put my face next to it, but it could be a dozen things. All my other pictures were fine though. It was just this one. Strange.\n\nI had Aileen put up a screw instead, that seemed to hold. But that incident made me keep my eyes open, and I started to notice other things around the house. For example, if you went into the basement, you could hear this strange pitter-patter behind the dryer. I figured it was rats, but it seemed a little too clean. Besides, Aileen had never mentioned there being rats, and she talked *a lot*.\n\nBut I tried my best not to think of it. An old house makes noise, that’s nothing new. I wasn’t living in a ghost story. No one is.\n\n \n\nBut then there was the pantry. The kitchen had an old sort of walk-in pantry for storing dry goods. It was more like a closet, if anything. Aileen used it to store things for her baking. She rarely used it, and I rarely left my room, but the few times I went down to the kitchen I’d grab a handful of almonds or some raisins for a quick snack.\n\nAnd every now and then, I’d hear something. Sometimes it’d sound like a closing door, other times it’d be a quick tap on the wall. This one time, a bag of flour flew off the shelf as I opened the door.\n\nSometimes I’d just stay and listen. And when I did, I could almost always hear something on the other side. Something moving. Crinkling paper bags. A rasping, like something heavy being dragged against hollow wood.\n\n \n\nI mentioned this to Aileen during one of our dinners. She’d made pasta carbonara.\n\n“I think you got rats or something,” I said.\n\n“Rats?” she chuckled. “There’s no rats.”\n\n“Well, you got something,” I said. “In there.”\n\nI nodded at the pantry. She frowned a little and went over to check, turning over a couple of bags and a sack of potatoes.\n\n“I don’t see anything,” she said. “You sure?”\n\n“You gotta listen,” I said. ”You don’t see it, you hear it.”\n\n“I’ll have to take your word for it.”\n\nWe finished dinner in silence, but I could tell this bothered her. She kept looking over at the pantry every now and then, as if waiting for it to expose itself.\n\n \n\nShe would keep doing this on and off for the next few day. I’d see her standing in the kitchen, still as a statue, listening. She’d shush me if I got too close.\n\n“I heard it,” she’d tell me. “I swear I heard it.”\n\nAt least I wasn’t the only one. But Aileen was taking it much harder than I was. For me it was just a bit weird, and I figured she’d call the exterminator, but she was taking it into her own hands. She couldn’t have something destroy her picture-perfect future with her estranged daughter, after all.\n\nSo her newfound obsession turned from a strange quirk to downright invasive. After about a week she was fed up and had begun breaking wood panels in the pantry to check the wall. She was convinced there was some kind of burrow hidden behind it, but she didn’t find anything.\n\n \n\nAileen would rip out the entire pantry, leaving items on the kitchen table. I’d have nowhere to sit for dinner, so I started eating in my room. I’d hear her go crazy downstairs with power tools, ripping into the wall. It’d make the entire house shake. Now pictures were falling off the walls, and I couldn’t tell if it was from the house, or from Aileen.\n\nThen one day, as I got home from school, she met me in the hall. She had these big safety goggles on, and her eyes were going wide.\n\n“I found it,” she said. “Come on, I’ll show you.”\n\n“I just gotta put this away.”\n\n“No, no,” she insisted. “It’ll just take a second.”\n\nShe took me by the arm. I pulled away, giving her a cold look.\n\n“I wanna put this away,” I repeated.\n\nShe looked me up and down. Then she took a deep breath and nodded.\n\n“Alright. Just hurry.”\n\n \n\nShe’d torn out the back wall of the pantry and taken down the shelves. Turns out the back wall was just a thin wooden layer, some insulation, and then a hollow space. It was about two feet wide and went through most of the walls.\n\n“I think they skimped on insulation when they built this place,” she said. “Something’s hiding up there.”\n\n“I told you. Rats.”\n\n“It’s not *rats!*”\n\nShe snapped at me, slamming her fist into the wall. My heart skipped a beat as I stepped back. She was breathing heavily. She wasn’t blinking.\n\n“I’m not telling you again,” she continued. “There are no rats. There have *never* been rats. This is a good house.”\n\n“Okay, fine,” I mumbled. “It’s not rats.”\n\nShe didn’t say anything, she just adjusted her safety goggles, picked up her cordless saw, and got back to it.\n\n \n\nI ended up staying in my room more often than not. Aileen kept working on the downstairs bathroom, tearing up the tiled floor to check underneath. Of course, she didn’t find anything. Every day she’d suggest something new. Maybe there were raccoons. Opossums. Maybe snakes. Looking deep enough under the floor, she even found that they’d been insulated with old newspapers, and sacks of dry grass and blue sunflowers. Something regional, I guess. Aileen was furious.\n\n“For all the years I’ve lived here, I’ve never had these problems”, she said. “I don’t know why it’s starting now. It doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“It’s not a big deal,” I assured her. “It’s probably nothing.”\n\n“But it’s not nothing though, is it? It’s something. We both heard it.”\n\n“Yeah, but who cares? You’re tearing up the house.”\n\n“Better me than *them*.”\n\n \n\nWe barely talked for a whole week. She would still help me around the house when she could, but as soon as the bare necessities were out of the way, she’d go back to tearing up the floor. She tried using traps and poison, but wouldn’t catch anything.\n\nOne day, I found her sitting on a pile of debris in the hallway. She was exhausted. She had dark circles under her eyes. I felt a bit sorry for her, so I sat down on the staircase to keep her company.\n\n“You should give it a rest,” I said. “Not, like, give up. Just take a break.”\n\n“I’m good,” she panted. “Just give me a sec.”\n\n“Don’t you ever use that sunchair anymore?” I asked. “You used to love those.”\n\n“The what?”\n\n“The sunchair,” I said. “The one out front.”\n\nShe looked at me for a while, not understanding what I was saying. Then something clicked.\n\n“Right, that,” she said. “I don’t really use that.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“What kind of life is that, just lounging around, waiting for something to happen?”\n\nAnd with that, she got up on her feet. She turned to me, power tool in hand. She was making a point.\n\n“Sometimes you gotta *do* something.”\n\n \n\nThe next time the picture of her and me fell from my wall, I didn’t bother putting it back up. There was no point. It would keep falling over and over again anyway. I just had to accept that my life was full of whirring, chopping, and clanking. I still barely knew the woman I lived with, and I was supposed to accept whatever nonsense she came up with.\n\nBut one day when I came home, she wasn’t chopping up the floor anymore. Instead, she was sitting on the stairs leading up to the front door, holding a bucket. And for the first time in weeks, Aileen looked satisfied. When I came up to her, she tapped the side of the bucket.\n\n“Check it,” she said. “Told you it wasn’t rats.”\n\nCane toads. About two dozen of them in total.\n\n“One of them hopped out of the pantry,” she continued. “I had to check around the basement, but they’d made a sort of nest around an old pipe.”\n\n“So that’s it?” I asked. “You got ‘em all?”\n\n“Sure did,” she laughed. “And I plugged up their nest. So we’re done.”\n\n“We’re done?”\n\nShe swept me up in a hug and kissed me on the side of the head. I felt so relieved. Maybe she could be normal again.\n\n \n\nAileen talked about bringing in a carpenter to fix the problems she’d found while breaking open the walls. Meanwhile, she settled on hastily assembling a couple of plywood pieces. We would have to use the upstairs shower for a while, to avoid water damage.\n\nShe eventually returned to her usual cheery self. I’d see her dancing around the kitchen to hits from the 90’s. We made our own scones one weekend. And not long after that, she returned to work. She’d taken some time off to get me set up, but now she was getting more confident. She worked as a county recorder, so she usually sat at a desk all day, or in long-winded meetings.\n\nIt was nice not having to worry about her anymore. I could focus on just keeping my newfound social life alive. In that age, that’s easier said than done.\n\n \n\nOne day, I came home talking on the phone with a friend from school. We were discussing a group English assignment, and how we were supposed to motivate a slacker to contribute. It was nice to talk to someone who despised group projects as much as I did.\n\nI threw my backpack on my bed, turned around, and stopped.\n\nThe picture on the wall was back up.\n\nNow, I knew for a fact I hadn’t put it back up there. I also knew cane toads weren’t to blame. So it had to be Aileen. But a part of me kept thinking – what if it wasn’t?\n\nI agonized over this for a while. If it wasn’t Aileen, it must’ve been someone else. But did I want to bring that to her attention? I’d seen the way she got upset over a couple of cane toads, who knew what she’d do if she suspected an actual intruder.\n\nI decided it was better to keep quiet, and to keep an ear to the ground.\n\n \n\nDespite Aileen’s best efforts, things weren’t as simple as a couple of toads poking around in the basement. Things were still moving in the pantry. I’d still hear something push against the wood panels. And at times, I’d see pictures move on their own.\n\nBut I kept my mouth shut. Aileen was like a different person. She was cheerful, motivated, and curious. We’d talk about my day, take turns buying groceries, and make all kinds of plans together. I was allowed to come and go freely, as long as she could keep tabs on me. Typical mom stuff.\n\nBut I’d still see the little things around the house. Once, I even moved a picture myself. And when I came back, it was fixed. Straightened.\n\nAnd Aileen had been gone all day.\n\n \n\nI would test this a little further each day. I’d place things around the house and take pictures with my phone. Later, I’d compare them, to see if anything changed. Sometimes, they did.\n\nFor example, pictures were straightened. A couple of cans in the pantry were rearranged to have the labels pointing outward. A few candle holders on a dresser downstairs were fixed to be the same height. Little, pointless things. I think the most noticeable thing was my stuffed animals. I only had a few from my old house, and I kept them on a chair in the corner. They were rearranged to always face outward. I didn’t do that.\n\nBut it wasn’t clear how this was happening, or why. And I didn’t want to bring it up with Aileen. Maybe she was doing it to mess with me, as a test.\n\n \n\nI decided to unpack my final box. I had been putting it off since it was mostly nostalgic stuff, but I figured it was time to bite the bullet. Pictures of dad and my stepmom, little trinkets and doodads. And, of course, my old pink dinosaur plushie. I’d had it since I was a baby. Dad used to say it was the first thing anyone gave me.\n\nAs I walked around the room, putting it all up, Aileen walked in. She helped me rearrange some things, made some small talk, and finally picked up the dino plushie.\n\n“Well isn’t this a handsome fellow,” she said. “What’s his name?”\n\nIt was such a strange question. It didn’t have a name, she should’ve known that. Then again, it’d been a while; but I decided to mess with her.\n\n“Don’t you remember?” I said. “It’s Kenny.”\n\n“Right, Kenny,” she nodded. “Glad to see he’s still around.”\n\nShe was probably just trying to make me feel at home, still. But it was weird. She was lying. It made me question what else she might be lying about.\n\n \n\nIt didn’t take Aileen that long to notice I was up to something. She noticed me taking pictures and rearranging things. It was her house, after all. She, if anyone, would notice if something was different. So one day, as we sat down for dinner, she put her hand on my phone.\n\n“I need you to tell me what you’re doing,” she said. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed.”\n\n“I don’t know,” I lied. “I’m just getting used to the place.”\n\n“There’s more to it,” she insisted. “I’ve seen what you do with the paintings and the photos.”\n\n“I’m just fixing them.”\n\n“No, you’re not.”\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye, and I could see that spark. Just like when was tearing out the pantry. That flame. There was no point in lying to her.\n\n“I’m not moving them. But *something…* is.”\n\n \n\nI told her what I’d noticed. I showed her the before-and-after pictures. And as soon as she realized this wasn’t a cane toad problem anymore, she got up from the table, locked the doors, and fetched her toolbox.\n\n“We’re not leaving this house until we’ve deal with this.”\n\n“Can’t we just call someone?” I asked. “What’s the big deal?”\n\n“No, we can’t,” Aileen said. “We’re dealing with this. *I’m* dealing with this.”\n\n“Well, I’m gonna go ahead and call someone.”\n\nShe snatched the phone from my hands, stepped into the pantry, and dropped it into the space between the walls. Before I could protest, she had her hand up in a shush.\n\n“This is serious,” she said. “And we need to deal with this.”\n\n \n\nThis time, she wasn’t taking any half-measures. She was tearing out walls, calling out to whatever intruder she’d imagined. She’d wake up at random times in the night, silently walking around the house, watching. She’d keep my bedroom door locked to make sure there were no distractions.\n\nThen, she got a gun. Maybe she’d always had one, but now she walked around with it. Her reasoning was; there was an intruder, and she needed to defend us. She would deal with this, one way or the other. And until she did, I wasn’t allowed to leave.\n\n“They could take you when you leave. Whenever you’re out of sight,” she’d say. “I can’t take that risk.”\n\nSo for days on end, there’d be no internet. No phone. Nothing but power tools and random shouts. Threats, smacks, screams – all directed at this invisible foe. And yet, at night, little things would change. But never in a way that Aileen would notice.\n\n \n\nThen, one morning, I woke up to this strange sound. A little vibration. I looked to the side, only to find my cell phone, laying on the nightstand. It was a bit dirty, and it had a crack in the corner, but it was functional. I thought that maybe Aileen was done, and that this was a peace offering.\n\nI walked into the hallway, only to see her using a screwdriver to remove an outlet from the wall. I quickly hid the phone behind my back, but I was a bit too quick on the draw. It slipped out of my hand and sailed across the floor, into my room. Aileen looked up.\n\n“What was that?”\n\nI couldn’t make up an excuse fast enough. She got up and pushed past me, almost launching me down the stairs. She picked up the phone from the floor and looked at me with disbelief.\n\n“Are you messing with me?” she asked. “Is this a joke to you?”\n\n“No,” I said. “It was just there.”\n\n“I am your *mother*,” she bellowed. “You don’t *lie* to me like this.”\n\n“You mean like you lied about Kenny?”\n\nShe shook her head and frowned.\n\n“Kenny?” she asked.\n\n“The dinosaur!” I snapped back. “He doesn’t have a name! But you keep pretending! Do you remember *anything* about me?!”\n\n \n\nAnd I confronted her. I asked about where I was born. I asked about my middle name. I asked about my dad, our first vacation, our first car. A couple of things she could answer, a couple of them she couldn’t. Maybe she was too surprised to think clearly.\n\n“You used to lay in your sunchair, on the front porch,” I said. “What did you used to drink when you did?”\n\n“This is ridiculous.”\n\n“You drank your favorite drink, every time you went out. What was it?”\n\n“Campari and orange juice,” she sighed. “That’s my favorite drink. I get that all the time.”\n\n“Wrong. You never drank while watching me. You never *once* did.”\n\nWe just looked at one another. A couple of uneasy thoughts crossed my mind.\n\nMaybe she wasn’t my mom.\n\n \n\nI headed for the stairs. She was right behind me, wielding the screwdriver like a knife. She asked me to stop, but I kept going. I headed straight for the front door, but she’d locked and bolted it. I got it open, but not fast enough. She caught up to me and slammed the door shut, leaning over me. Her faces were inches away from mine.\n\n“You’ll have to wait in the basement while I fix this,” she panted. “Don’t make a fuss.”\n\n“You’re not my mom, are you?”\n\nShe didn’t respond. She just grabbed my arm, and led me downstairs.\n\n \n\nI didn’t even know the basement door had a lock, but turns out, it did. It was just me, a washer, a dryer, and old boxes. Nothing important; mostly just holiday stuff. Christmas, thanksgiving, 4^(th) of July.\n\nI stayed down there all day; hearing Aileen tear the place apart. She couldn’t let go. No matter what, she was going to have her perfect house, and her perfect daughter. Nothing was supposed to go wrong, but somehow, it had. Maybe she thought I would forget about the whole thing if she just finished up quickly. Hell, maybe she was planning on getting me something really, really nice.\n\nBut I couldn’t let go of that one thought. That maybe Aileen wasn’t my actual mom. Maybe she was just some woman living here. But she had the pictures. There was mail addressed to her from years back in the basement boxes. I couldn’t make sense of it.\n\n \n\nSo I waited for hours. Aileen’s frustration grew louder and violent. I could hear her throw things, knock over furniture, and yell at the walls.\n\n*“What do you want?!”* she’d scream. *“Who are you?!”*\n\nShe was still using her power tools. Cutting into the walls. Into the furniture. I could hear something falling apart. Something thumping down the stairs. And with every crash, Aileen would get angrier. Until finally, she would break down crying, hysterically, in the hallway above.\n\nI tried not to listen. I had no idea what she was capable of anymore. So instead, I brought out one of the old boxes, and browsed.\n\n \n\nOld bills, newspaper cancellations, birthday cards, all kinds of everyday things. I didn’t even bother to read most of them. They were all addressed to Aileen, and there was nothing more to it. Little bits and bobs of a life well-lived.\n\nI stopped at a couple of birthday cards. There were a couple from me. I sent her one on her 40^(th) birthday, and it was there. There were invitations to weddings, Christmas cards, well-wishes. Even a couple of “get well” cards from when she had her appendix taken out. But underneath, I find something strange. A custom print.\n\n“Good luck on the move,” one card said. “We’ll miss you.”\n\nI turned it over. Three friends looking into the camera. Two looking sarcastically sad, and a third woman rolling her eyes. Addressed a couple of years ago.\n\n \n\nBut the woman in the middle, the one it was clearly addressed to, wasn’t Aileen. It was a stranger. A stranger holding a fruity drink, and who had the same eyes as me. The ‘Aileen’ I knew was off to the side.  A friend.\n\nThe card was signed Bella and Laura. The woman on the right – was *Laura*. Not Aileen.\n\n \n\nI dropped the card on the floor and looked up. I was in a stranger’s house. Someone who’d known my real mother and taken her place. And that person was freaking out upstairs, armed with power tools.\n\nI had no idea how much danger I was in, but I could feel it. My body tensed up. Every breath felt colder, sharper. My legs grew restless; getting ready to run. I had to do something.\n\nI put the box back on the shelf. She didn’t need to know that I knew. I looked for a tool; something to pop the door open with. But there was nothing; she’d made sure of that. I thought maybe I could break open something from the washer and use it as a lockpick, or something. *Anything*.\n\n \n\nBut the door popped open. Pop.\n\nAileen didn’t do that. No one did.\n\nIt was just… open.\n\n \n\nI walked up the stairs, carefully looking out. Aileen was moving around upstairs. It couldn’t have been her. I opened the door, took a few steps outside, and headed for the front door. Then, the floor creaked. I stopped and held my breath.\n\nThen – footsteps.\n\nAileen came running down the stairs. I threw myself on the front door, and this time, I got it open in time. I was out, running across the front lawn. Wet grass tangled between my toes. I headed for the closest neighbor, screaming at the top of my lungs. I saw a door open across the street.\n\nThen, I heard a gunshot.\n\n \n\nI dropped to the ground, covering my head. The neighbors screamed and hurried back inside. Aileen, or Laura, had pulled out her handgun. She’d fired a warning shot. She grabbed me by the arm and pulled me back inside, still holding the gun. Perfectly cut grass stuck to my face as I was dragged past the forgotten sunchair.\n\n“I live here now!” she yelled through gritted teeth. “She moved! I live here now! You don’t get to pick your mom!”\n\nShe pulled me back inside and locked the door. She took me upstairs into my bedroom and locked that door too. We sat down across from each other on the floor, with her gun casually pointed my way.\n\n \n\nWe stayed there for a couple of minutes, just looking at each other. Two strangers, sharing a house. She looked different in the dark. I could see it now.\n\n“I wanted to make things perfect,” she sighed. “It was supposed to be different this time. Aileen was supposed to be *different*.”\n\n“What did you do to her?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“She moved. I just didn’t file the papers.”\n\nOf course. She worked at the county records. Aileen’s official address was still registered here. So when they looked her up, they reached Laura, still living there. And she’d just… went for it.\n\n“If I could get *you*, I could get *anyone*,” she continued. “Then I’d really *be* her. And not, well, me.”\n\nShe picked up the pink dinosaur plushy and casually tossed it aside. She was done pretending. And with that, she raised the handgun.\n\n“I have to try again,” she murmured. “I’m sorry.”\n\n“Don’t do this.”\n\n“What choice do I have?” she asked. “Would you like to be me?”\n\nI didn’t answer. She shook her head again.\n\n“Didn’t think so.”\n\n \n\nMy tongue felt dry. A sting of salt burned my eye from a cold sweat. I didn’t know whether to throw myself at her or shield my face. Instead, I did nothing. My forehead felt cold, as if anticipating a bullet.\n\nShe tensed her trigger finger – but nothing happened.\n\n \n\nSee, there’s this thing about old houses.\n\nThe shadows seem a little longer. There are noises coming out of every corner. Nine times out of ten, it’s just the wind. A poorly constructed wall. Or hell, maybe a cane toad.\n\nBut this shadow had been different. Shadows don’t fix pictures on the walls. They don’t raid your pantry. And they don’t put back the one picture you have of your real mom on the wall, as if trying to show you when you’re being lied to.\n\nAnd they certainly don’t put a long, dark, bone-like finger, in the way of a trigger.\n\nBut this one *did*.\n\n \n\nIt emerged from the wallpaper, a solid shade of chromatic dark. Leaning over Laura like a misshapen shadow. Taller, longer, slimmer. At least seven feet tall, but hunched over into a ball. It had put a long dark finger in the way of the trigger, stopping Laura from pulling it.\n\nHer breathing quickened. She tried to push, but nothing happened. She struggled and strained, trying with two hands – but nothing.\n\nInstead, a second hand grasped the back of her head, and smashed her straight forward, into the floor.\n\n \n\nI’d never seen anything so violent. One forceful smack, and she’d lost all her front teeth, broken her nose, and cracked part of her forehead. It left a blood-tufted dent on the wooden floor.\n\nThe thing stopped for a moment, giving Laura a chance to gasp for air. As she did, it turned to the pink dinosaur plushie – and put it back on the drawer, facing outward. Even now, it couldn’t stop itself from making things right. Maybe that was the point all along – to set things right. Labels out. Pictures straight. *No lies*.\n\nIn one swift motion, it stood up, dragging Laura along like a hapless ventriloquist puppet. It slammed the bedroom door open with its shoulder, knocking it off its hinges, clattering to the floor. Laura kicked and screamed, kicking and slapping candle holders, chairs, and photos as she went.\n\nI looked down the hallway, only to see them disappear into the bathroom. Laura couldn’t form a sentence anymore, but kept making this pleading moan. Even from a distance, you could hear her spitting up teeth.\n\n \n\nBut the bathroom door closed. There were screams. A mirror being broken. Thumping, over and over, as a body was beaten into a pulp. Bone against ceramic tiles. Flesh crushed into paste.\n\nI didn’t even notice the sirens outside. The neighbors had called the police. I didn’t notice them breaking down the front door, or coming up the stairs. But when they did, they bore witness to the same thing I did. Laura, and something else, locked in the bathroom.\n\nThere was a final shriek cut short, as Laura was thrown out of the second story bathroom window.\n\n \n\nI was wrapped in a blanket and taken out on the lawn. An officer held a hand up, asking me not to look. My shaking hands looked weird in the blue and red light. The neighbors were peeking out their front door again. And no one could explain what’d happened in that bathroom.\n\nAnd in the days that followed, no one could explain why all the chairs, photos, and candle holders had been put back in their rightful place overnight.\n\n \n\nAfter that, things went by fast. Laura had willingly committed a clerical error to service her elaborate identity theft, and things were corrected. My biological mother flew down from Nashville, where she’d moved about one and a half year prior. A couple of her boxes had gotten lost in the move, and she’d been fighting to get her paperwork in order. Apparently, it was as if someone had been actively fighting her efforts. Imagine that.\n\nMoving in with her is another story in itself. A rather mundane one. But she still lounged in her sunchair, listening to the radio. She had her favorite drink on the weekends. And she knew that my pink dinosaur plushie didn’t need a name to be my favorite thing.\n\nIt wasn’t much, but it was *real*.\n\n \n\nToday, I’m 27 years old. A couple of years ago I moved back to that little community outside Crystal River. I bought that same house for myself, and painstakingly fixed it up over two drawn-out summers. It was cheap, but a lot of work.\n\nSome people would question why I’d ever want to go back there, but I can’t see myself living anywhere else. Yes, it was traumatic. But that wasn’t the house’s fault. That was Laura.\n\nNo, this is a house of little creaks and nudges. Of long shadows. Of cane toads in the yard, and pictures I don’t bother to straighten.\n\nAnd I’d rather live in a crooked home than a perfect hell."},"86":{"title":"I Housesat for My Parents When I was 19. Something Terrifying Happened to Me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdksa7\/i_housesat_for_my_parents_when_i_was_19_something\/","flair":null,"author":"CarlB1961","selftext":"Have you ever felt terror? Genuine pure terror, the real deal? I'm not talking being scared or frightened or afraid, I mean being absolutely terrified to the very core of your soul? There isn't a feeling quite like it in all of human experience. It's not like being scared watching a horror movie; there's a comforting buffer of reality in between us and what we see on the big screen of a theater or the smaller one of a TV. We know what we're seeing isn't real, no matter how frightening it is. And terror isn't like the thrilling surge of adrenaline you feel when the rollercoaster cart plunges from the pinnacle of its track.... although that's maybe the closest thing to it.\n\nTerror is something primal, even primordial; something we inherited from our earliest cave-dwelling ancestors. Something atavistic that's intertwined with our most basic sense of survival and self-preservation. The sudden heart-racing, neck-prickling alertness of a hunter who hears the roar of the beast he's been pursuing...coming from directly behind him.\n\nThe footsteps you hear stealthily following you in a dark, deserted parking lot.\n\nThe split-second you have to react when you see the drunk driver cross the center line in front of you, bearing down on your vehicle at eighty miles an hour, the useless scream of brakes, the horn, the headlights growing brighter and brighter, flooding your vision.\n\nThe light switch you frantically search for in the dark...only to feel someone else's hand covering it.\n\nPure terror is something most of us, if we're lucky, will never truly experience in our lives (although we probably think we have at some point or another).\n\nI am not so lucky.\n\nI became intimately acquainted with pure terror when I was nineteen. And I haven't been the same since.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was a summer night in 2018 when it happened. I was home from college, having just recently completed my freshman year. I was housesitting for my parents while they were in Florida for two weeks, enjoying their second honeymoon.\n\nMy parents had recently come into a decent-sized sum of money, a compensation settlement my father had collected after an injury at his job had left him slightly disabled. They had used some of the money to purchase an old two-story farmhouse out in the country, something they had always talked about doing, and had moved out of the suburbs, away from the city where they had lived their whole lives. The house was pretty big, fourteen rooms, and old; well over a hundred years. It had been pretty run-down when they bought it (which is probably why they had gotten it rather cheap) but my dad had done a lot of renovations on it, doing the work himself, and had fixed it up pretty decently. It was actually a pretty nice place, pleasantly quaint, but with all the modern amenities. It was surrounded by acres of farmland, five miles from town and two miles from the closest neighbors.\n\nThey had asked me if I wanted to watch the house while they were gone, partly because it would have been the first time I really had a chance to enjoy having the run of the place since they'd fixed it up and mostly because they knew I didn't have much else going for me that summer. I wasn't a very popular guy and hadn't made many friends at college. No girlfriend, either. In fact, my social life was essentially non-existent...a fact my parents were aware of. I think they probably felt sorry for me.\n\nI had, of course, jumped on the offer, and why not? A place I could crash at for two weeks free. What was there not to like about a deal like that?\n\nThe first couple days went by uneventfully. Mostly I just wandered around during the day, exploring their new house and the surrounding property. At night I hung out in the living room watching cable TV or browsing the internet on my laptop while stuffing my face with junk food before crashing out on the couch.\n\nAs I said earlier, my parents' new house was huge; more of a mansion, actually. The people who originally built it must have been rich. There were four bedrooms upstairs, only one of which was used (by my parents, obviously). One of the other three were used for storage and the remaining two bedrooms were completely vacant. There was also the upstairs bathroom and another room that had probably originally been a sewing room but was now used by my father as an office.\n\nOn the first floor, there was a rather spacious foyer with a hallway that lead to the living room. There was the kitchen, a neighboring pantry, another bathroom, the dining room, and another large room that was probably supposed to be a parlor. My dad had remodeled it as a rec room with a pool table that could also be converted to a ping-pong table and an air hockey game. There was also an attached shed\/two-car garage, plus an attic and a basement that ran the full length of the house above it.\n\nMy parents were thrilled with their new place and amazed that they had been able to score such a great deal on it, even accounting for its originally dilapidated condition. I was happy for them, but at the same time, there was something about the house that gave me a mildly uncomfortable feeling. I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was. Just an uneasy sense that there was something not quite right about it. I brushed it off and told myself I was just being paranoid from the sudden sense of isolation I felt. I had grown up on the outskirts of a big city and had just spent the past nine months on a busy college campus with thousands of other students and this was really the first time I had really been alone and on my own since...well, since ever.\n\nBut then, on the third night...something happened.\n\nI was sitting in the living room eating some Chinese food I had picked up in town and watching the 2004 remake of *Dawn of the Dead* on cable. It was early in the film, the scene where Mekhi Phifer's character is checking to make sure the mall entrances are locked when out of nowhere -- jump scare! -- a badly mutilated zombie with half its face eaten away from the bare skull smashes against the glass, starling him, and the audience.\n\nI jumped back too (even though I had probably seen the movie a hundred times already and knew it was coming), nearly spilling my Moo goo gai pan all over myself. I laughed nervously and admonished myself for being so jumpy. Maybe watching a scary movie while alone at night in a house in the middle of nowhere wasn't exactly a good idea.\n\nIt was going on eleven and I was thinking about turning in...when something caught my attention and I perked my ears up, suddenly alert.\n\nI thought I had heard something.\n\nI grabbed the remote and quickly muted the TV, listening intently.\n\nI heard it again, coming from upstairs, directly above me: a soft, quiet shuffling sound. Then the creak of a floorboard, followed a moment later by another. As if something was moving very lightly across the floor, gingerly moving from step to step, trying to avoid detection.\n\nI felt a sudden jolt of alarm. My first instinct was to reach for my phone to dial 911 and report an intruder, but I quickly repressed that urge. This was an old house, and old houses made all sorts of strange noises. Or it could be some kind of small animal. I was already spooked from watching my horror movie, and might be letting my imagination get the best of me. I didn't want to overreact and get the police involved in something that might turn out to be nothing at all.\n\nI had to investigate it first.\n\nI wasn't thrilled with that thought. I paused for a moment, thinking. I couldn't go up there unarmed, in case it *did* turn out to be...something serious. My parents didn't own any guns, so I grabbed a fireplace poker - it was better than nothing - and quietly, cautiously, went down the front hall to the foyer where the staircase was located. I crept slowly up the steps, one at a time, my heart racing, alert for the slightest noise from above me. But the shuffling sounds had stopped.\n\nI was scared, and my fear only increased with each riser I took. I arrived at the top of the stairs. The upstairs hallway ran in either direction in front of me. To my left were two unoccupied bedrooms and the bathroom.  To my right, my parents' bedroom, the other empty bedroom, my dad's office, and the door that led up to the attic.\n\nI turned left, deciding to start at that end and search each room systematically to the other end.\n\nI reached the first bedroom door. Raising the poker, I reached for the knob. I hesitated a second, pressing my ear against the door, listening. I heard nothing from the other side. Gulping, summoning my courage, I turned the knob and flung open the door.\n\nThe bedroom was dark.\n\nI reached in to flip the light switch...then withdrew my hand, imagining my fingers encountering the hand - or *claw* \\- of someone or some*thing* already over it. The next second it would grab my wrist in a vise-like grip and yank me inside the pitch-black room, the door slamming shut, my blood-curdling scream the last sound I would ever make...\n\nI inwardly told my overworking imagination to shut up with that crap. I told myself to stop acting chickenshit. I wasn't some scared little kid afraid of the dark anymore, I was a full-grown adult and I had to act like it.\n\nI reached inside and felt around on the wall until I found the light switch. No psycho killer's hand or monster's claw already there. I flicked it and the light came on. I scanned the interior of the bedroom.\n\nIt was the room my parents used as storage space and was cluttered with all kinds of stuff: boxes of old clothes, stacks of books, my dad's fishing gear, Christmas decorations, etc. I looked around but there was nothing and no one lurking in the room. I raised the poker and opened the closet, but it was empty apart from some spare bedsheets on a shelf and a box of family photos on the floor.\n\nI left the first bedroom and moved onto the second. I opened the door and turned on the light. The room was vacant and completely barren. No furniture, just bare walls and a dusty floor (I noted there were no footprints in the dust). I opened the closet and saw it contained only a box of poisoned mouse bait and a few dust balls on the floor.\n\nEmboldened, feeling somewhat reassured, I did a quick but thorough sweep of the remaining second-floor rooms, but they were all empty and nothing seemed out of place.\n\nThat left only one last place to check.\n\nI turned to the last remaining door, the one at the end of the hallway...the attic. I felt another brief stir of apprehension. The attic was the one place in the house I had yet to really explore.\n\nI opened the door and was met with a flight of ascending stairs climbing into darkness. There was an outrush of musty air. There was no light switch at the bottom of the stairs; I would have to climb into the darkness.\n\nI took out my phone, turned on the flashlight app, then forced myself to climb the steps to the top.\n\nI aimed my light around. The attic was a long but somewhat narrow room with tiny, old-fashioned round windows on either end and old cobwebs hanging from the eaves like tattered streamers. It was heaped with old junk left over by the previous owners that my parents had yet to clear out. My flashlight illuminated a hanging lightbulb with a pull-cord in the center of the attic. I quickly pulled it and the attic was lit with dim, yellow illumination. I carefully inspected my surroundings. An old, splintered bed frame, an ancient sewing machine, a TV set that looked like it was from the 1950s, a battered kerosene space heater, a box of mostly broken dishes and rusted utensils, a wooden rocking horse that was probably from the turn of the century, a headless, armless figure standing in the corner--\n\nI jumped back with a startled gasp, feeling my heart leap. I took a closer look...and relaxed with a sigh. It was just an old dressmaker's dummy standing upright.\n\nI emitted a nervous, shaky laugh.\n\n*Dipshit. What were you expecting to find up here? Freddy-fucking-Krueger?*\n\nI looked around a final time but the only person standing in the attic was me.\n\nI felt my muscles unclenching with relief. Nothing. No homicidal madmen, no monsters or ghosts or demons or Lovecraftian abominations. Just my own overactive imagination.\n\nI was about ready to turn around and go back downstairs...when suddenly the lightbulb went out.\n\n*Shit!*\n\nUsing my flashlight, I scrambled down from the attic, only to find that the lights on the second floor were also out. The power had gone out.\n\nI understood at once what had happened.\n\nThe fuse box.\n\nThe house's electrical system was hooked up to an ancient, outdated fuse box my father was intending to replace with a modern circuit breaker. It was the last big job he hadn't gotten around to yet. My parents had warned me before they left for their trip that the fuse box was old and clunky and prone to failing once in a while. And when that happened, it usually meant a fuse had blown out and needed replacing.\n\nThe fuse box was in the basement.\n\nI felt a prickling sensation on my skin and the hairs on the back of my neck rising.\n\nThe basement was one place in the house that especially made me feel distinctly uncomfortable. Something about the atmosphere of it seemed particularly oppressive and sinister. I had tried to avoid going down there as much as possible, especially after nightfall...but unless I wanted to spend the night in the dark, now I had no choice.\n\nI pumped myself up for the trip as best as I could, telling myself there was nothing down there to be afraid of. I had been down there before after all, and nothing had happened...\n\nBut that had been during the day, when my parents were still home.\n\n*You fucking coward,* an inner voice chided me in disgust, *just go and get it over with.*\n\nI went downstairs and entered the kitchen. The basement door stood between the refrigerator and the pantry. I opened it and aimed my light down the stairs. I listened, but heard only dead silence.\n\nI descended slowly, the steps creaking beneath my weight. Despite my best efforts, I was still scared.\n\nAt the bottom, I turned in a circle, looking around. The basement was a huge open space, the same dimensions as the house above it. Mortared rock walls and a cement floor. Several stone columns stood here and there supporting the weight of the structure above it. In the far corner stood the furnace. Running along the length of the rear wall was an empty wine rack. Pipes ran along the ceiling. The fuse box was mounted on the wall opposite the stairs, thirty feet away.\n\nI crossed over to it quickly and examined it. Sure enough, a fuse had burned out. I hastily unscrewed the bad fuse and tossed it away, digging a new one out of the box of replacements on a nearby shelf. I screwed it into the socket...but the basement remained dark.\n\nI turned around, and could see the power was back on above; light was streaming down the stairs from the kitchen doorway.\n\nI realized that the switch to the basement lights was still off; I had forgotten to flip it on my way downstairs.\n\nI looked at the stairs, leading to light and safety only thirty feet away.\n\n*Okay, it's done, now get the hell out of here,* my mind's voice ordered me.\n\nAnd I was about to follow orders and leave, was in the process of raising my foot to take the first step...when, from the dark recesses of the other end of the basement, I heard something that made my blood run cold in an instant.\n\nA giggle.\n\nA short, high-pitched giggle. A gleeful sound; that of a very young, mischievous child playing a prank. It only lasted for a second, then abruptly stopped. Under different circumstances, a perfectly ordinary sound I wouldn't have given a second thought. But in this context, in these circumstances, coming from the blackness of my parents' basement in the middle of night, it was a sound simple enough to be absolutely terrifying.\n\nI spun in that direction, waving my light around, my heart sending a surge of terrified adrenalin racing through my body. I couldn't see anything but the bare wine rack and the furnace. I squinted, trying to peer into the basement's darkest corners where my phone light wouldn't penetrate.\n\n\"Who's there?\" I demanded in a trembling voice.\n\nNo answer.\n\nTwo of those support columns stood between me and the far end of the basement. Each was about a foot and a half wide and obstructed my view of what could be on the other side. *Anything* could be hiding behind them.\n\n\"Come out where I can see you or you're in big trouble!\" I ordered, trying to sound stern...but my voice quivered pathetically, betraying my fear.\n\nI envisioned myself boldly crossing the basement and lunging around the columns to confront whoever - or *whatever* \\- was lurking there. I tried to do just that; tried to will my body to follow the commands of my brain...but I couldn't move. I was petrified, more terrified than I had ever been before in my life.\n\nThe stale air in the basement suddenly seemed too thick and oppressive. I seemed to sense another presence down there with me; something dark and forbidding emanating from the very walls of the basement themselves, something ancient and horrible beyond human comprehension. A force that was watching my every move, waiting with malevolent patience for the right time to strike.\n\nI looked at the stairs leading up to the kitchen door and the light and safety beyond. Only thirty feet away. If I ran, it would take me only a few seconds...\n\nI heard that horrible, high-pitched giggle again, only this time it seemed to be coming from the side of the basement opposite where I'd heard it originally...even though there was no way it could have moved across the basement without me seeing it. It was followed by the voice of a child, speaking my name, drawing it out in a playful sing-song.\n\nThe voice seemed to be coming from behind another column, one that was only about five feet away from the stairs...my only means of escape.\n\nI understood with sudden soul-chilling certainty that if I tried to run for the stairs that...*thing* would leap out and attack me before I could make it. I would *see* it, whatever it was, and the sight of it would drive me mercifully insane before it killed me.\n\nThe voice spoke my name again, teasingly, and I thought my ears could detect a slight shuffling sound behind the column, followed by a scraping...the sound of nails, or claws, scratching over stone.\n\nI felt as if my entire body had been plunged into freezing water. Coherent thought became nearly impossible. My lungs ached, and I dimly realized that in the extremity of my fear I had forgotten to breathe.\n\nI heard another scraping sound, and another shuffling sound, as if the thing behind the column was subtly adjusting its stance, getting ready to spring out from its hiding place and charge me. If I wouldn't come to it, it would come to me. Either way, I was going to meet a horrific, unspeakable end.\n\nMy paralysis suddenly broke. Moving purely on instinct, seemingly without conscious thought, I sprinted for the stairs, taking my chances. I thought I caught a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye as I passed the column nearest the stairs, but I didn't dare look back. I rushed up the stairs, not so much climbing as leaping up them, two at a time.\n\nI was convinced the door would slam shut in my face, just as I was about to reach safety, plunging me into the darkness. Then I would hear a gurgling, soulless, inhuman laugh, smell its reeking breath, and feel its claws sink into my flesh.\n\nBut that didn't happen.\n\nI passed through the doorway into the kitchen, and as I did, I felt, or *imagined* I felt, a brief tugging sensation at the back of my shirt.\n\nI slammed the basement door. There was a deadbolt lock on it, and I turned it. I leaned against the locked door, gasping, trying to slow my heart. Abruptly all my muscles seemed to turn to gelatin and I collapsed to the floor in a sitting position.\n\nRelief flooded my body in a cool, soothing wave. I was safe now. I emitted a short, hysterical laugh, feeling weirdly giddy all of a sudden. Probably a delayed reaction.\n\n*That did* not *really happen*, the logical center of my mind spoke up, reasserting itself, trying to rationalize what I had just experienced. *None of that really happened. It was all in your head, a paranoid hallucination. It* had *to be.*\n\nI was all too happy to quickly agree with that voice. I had let my imagination get carried away, that was all. After all, it wasn't as if I had actually *seen* anything.\n\nBut, just to be safe, I decided I wasn't going to set foot back down into the basement ever again. And I would keep the door locked the rest of my stay.\n\nI got shakily to my feet and went back into the living room. *Dawn of the Dead* was still on TV. I quickly changed the channel, in no mood to continue watching it, and found an old Farrelly Brothers comedy instead. I sat down on the couch, starting to relax and feel normal again...and heard the front door opening.\n\nI jumped to my feet, my body tensing again. I could hear footsteps walking down the front hall, approaching the living room.\n\nPerspiration broke out all over my body. I clenched my fists, my eyes locked on the living room doorway as the sound drew closer.\n\nMy parents entered. They stood in the doorway, ten feet away, smiling at me gently.\n\nOnce again I felt my system flood with an overload of relief. I was so happy to see them it didn't even occur to me to wonder what they were doing home so early, when their vacation was supposed to last another week and a half. It didn't occur to me to wonder why they weren't carrying their luggage or why they hadn't called in advance to tell me they were coming back so soon. It didn't occur to me to wonder why I hadn't heard the engine of my father's car pulling up outside. I was just so overwhelmed with happiness to see the two people I loved most in the world, the two people I had always trusted to protect me and keep me safe.\n\nI took a step towards them, already beginning to hold out my arms to hug my mother. \"Mom, Dad, thank God you're here. You won't believe--\"\n\nI stopped, halting in my tracks, staring at them. Something wasn't right. They were just standing there, not moving. They hadn't said a word. They were still smiling at me...but there was something unsettlingly vacant about their smiles. Their faces were otherwise emotionless, their eyes blank. They looked like a pair of mannequins in a department store window, totally void of animation.\n\nI looked at them, concerned. \"Mom? Dad? What's wrong?\"\n\nSlowly, without saying a word, still smiling, my mother reached up one hand and grabbed ahold of her scalp just above her forehead. Pulling down hard, in one swift motion, she tore her face off like a latex mask, exposing raw, bleeding muscle and sinew. Her eyes bulged from lidless sockets, her lipless mouth grinning hideously. A fountain of blood streamed down her face. She began to laugh, an awful, maniacal cackle.\n\nBeside her, my father reached into his mouth and ripped his lower jaw off. A torrent of blood gushed down the front of his jacket. His tongue, unnaturally long, dangled to his chest like a grotesque neck tie.\n\nThey held out their arms to me and began to approach.\n\nI didn't scream even though I wanted to. In fact, quite the opposite; it felt as if the air that wanted to escape my mouth in a loud outrush of horror was sucked back down my throat in an implosion that threatened to burst my lungs.\n\nI turned and ran away from the hideous doppelgangers of my parents. I fled out of the living room, through the dining room and into the kitchen. I grabbed the knob of the back door, flung it open and lunged through it...\n\nOnly to find myself not in the safety of the summer night outside, but standing in the foyer.\n\nHorrified and utterly bewildered, I looked behind me and saw the front door standing open on the dark night beyond. I didn't pause to analyze what had just happened; I didn't have time. Those things pretending to be my parents were coming down the front hall, reaching for me, the thing that looked like my mother still laughing insanely, the thing that looked like my father gurgling unintelligibly from its jawless mouth.\n\nI spun around in a panic and leaped through the front door....\n\nAnd once again, I was back in the foyer, facing the opposite direction, as if I had just stepped through it from outside.\n\nThose things were still after me, only a few feet away.\n\nTerrified beyond comprehension, almost past the point of rational thought, I took the only avenue of escape left to me. I bolted up the staircase to the second floor.\n\nI ran into the first room I came upon, one of the vacant bedrooms. I slammed the door behind me. There was no lock on the door, just an empty keyhole below the knob.\n\nFrantically, I looked around for something I could use to barricade the door, but the room was completely empty.\n\nI braced myself against the door, hoping my weight would be enough to keep it closed. I waited, listening. Several minutes passed...but nothing happened. I pressed my ear against the door. I heard only silence on the other side. They had stopped their pursuit. I thought about opening the door to look, but then wondered if it could be a trap. Maybe they were waiting for me on the other side.\n\nHad I thought I had been terrified down in the basement? That had been nothing, a pale shadow of the all-consuming, existential terror that enveloped me now.\n\nI had to escape, had to get the hell out of this house. I looked around the room and spotted a window. I was two stories up, but would take my chances and drop to the ground below. If it meant a broken ankle or leg, so be it. Survival was more important.\n\nBefore I could move, the room was suddenly filled with harsh, hollow laughter. It wasn't the high, deceptively innocent giggle I had thought I'd heard in the basement or the shrill, lunatic cackling of the thing impersonating my mother; it was a different sound altogether. Low and coarse and cruel. Unnaturally deep and distinctly inhuman. It seemed to come from all around me, seemed to fill the room, yet had no apparent source.\n\nI froze, looking around, scrutinizing my surroundings carefully. There was no one else in the room. The closet door was still standing open from my earlier investigation. The closet was empty. I was alone. Wait - what...*what is that??!*\n\nOn the other side of the room, something was moving on the wall. That was my first impression. But as I watched, spellbound in horror, I realized that the wall *itself* was moving. Bulging out with unnatural elasticity as if something was trying to burst through it from the other side. A round, convex shape pushed out from the center of the wall with two smaller ones on either side and slightly lower. The larger shape took on the distinct outline of facial features as it emerged, the plaster over it stretching out like latex. The smaller ones were hands.\n\nI turned to flee and grabbed the knob...only to find it wouldn't turn. As if it had been locked behind me...or had locked itself. Trapped, I turned back and watched helplessly, numb, as the thing forced its way out of the wall. It didn't break through the wall; it separated from it like it was liquid, leaving the wall undamaged and unmarked behind it. It stood there, a featureless humanoid figure that, for a few seconds, wore the color and pattern of the faded wallpaper over its entire body like a chameleon. Then it rippled and took its true form. It was tall and skeletal and stooped over. Its entire body and head were draped in a shredded, filthy shroud. All I could see of its face was its burning red eyes and misshapen, enormous mouth which was twisted into an malicious grin. Its mouth was lined with what appeared to be several rows of long, needle-pointed teeth.\n\nThe fingers at the end of its long, bony arms were unnaturally long and protruding from their tips were four-inch talons like jagged shards of sharpened metal.\n\nIt staggered towards me, grinning, and I understood that *this* was the being that had been stalking me all night. Everything else had only been a manifestation of it, an illusion. It had influenced me, manipulated me, preyed upon my fear, and finally lured me up here to my certain doom. It seemed to exude malevolent like an invisible aura.\n\nIt uttered another terrible, gloating, inhuman laugh and closed in for the kill.\n\nI retreated on quivering legs into the corner and crouched down, cowering, shielding my face with my hands uselessly.\n\nIt towered over me, reeking of death. It extended its claws toward me, and\n\n\n\nI sat up with a scream, terrified, disoriented, I looked around. I was sitting on the couch in my parents' living room. *Dawn of the Dead* was still on. it was near the end, when Jake Weber's character reveals he's been bitten by a zombie and stays behind on the dock, watching the survivors drift away on a boat before committing suicide.\n\nI looked around, paranoid, but I was alone in the living room. I glanced at the clock on the wall. It was nearly midnight. I had drifted off and been asleep for over an hour.\n\nI leaned back, trying to catch my breath. I ran a shaking hand over my face. My heart was hammering in my chest so hard and so rapidly for a moment I was afraid I was going to go into cardiac arrest, but gradually, it slowed down to a normal rate.\n\nI sighed. It had all just been a nightmare. The worst fucking nightmare of my life.\n\nSuddenly my phone rang, causing me scream again and nearly jump through the ceiling. I fumbled out my phone and looked at the screen. It was my parents calling to check in. I answered and spoke to my mom for a few minutes, listening as she talk about their trip and what she and Dad had done today in Florida. Towards the end she expressed concern, noting that I sounded out of breath and asked me if I was alright. I told her I was fine, I had just been doing some exercises before bed. I was surprised by how calm my voice was. We said good-night to each other and I ended the call.\n\nI looked around, still feeling ill at ease and unsafe after my particularly vivid bad dream. Nightmare or not, I was too rattled to feel like sleeping here. In fact, I decided right then and there I wasn't going to spend another night in this place. I grabbed my keys and wallet, hoped in my car, and drove into town, checking into a cheap motel. The next day I rented a small apartment, using some money I had in my savings. When my parents called to tell me they were coming home, I drove to the house and waited there to meet them, giving them the impression that I had stayed there all along. I didn't tell them what had happened to me. How could I? I would have just made an ass of myself, a nineteen-year-old man who had gotten scared watching a horror movie and had a bad dream like a kid.\n\nThey invited me to stay at their house for the rest of the summer, an invitation I politely declined, claiming I didn't want to be a burden.\n\nI took a summer job working for a landscaping company and stayed in my apartment in town until classes resumed in the fall.\n\nI did some research on the house, looking into its history and its previous owners. I couldn't find anything that seemed unusual. No news of strange deaths or murders or disappearances. No rumors that a former occupant had secretly been a devil worshiper or that the house had been built upon an old cemetery or Native American burial ground.\n\nMy parents still live there, and nothing out of the ordinary has ever happened to them, as far as I'm aware of. But I still feel guilty that I never told them what I experienced in that house. I feel like I have an obligation to warn them, but it's not like they'd believe me anyway.\n\nYou see, about a week after my parents got back from Florida, I was doing some cleaning in my apartment on my day off. I was digging my dirty laundry out of the closet (I guess I'm pretty lazy when it comes to housekeeping and it had really piled up) and I came upon the shirt I had been wearing that night. I had tossed it into the closet the next day after moving in and hadn't washed it since. As I was putting it in my laundry bag I noticed something and took a closer look.\n\nThere were four thin slashes in the back of the shirt. Slashes that looked like they'd been made by claws."},"87":{"title":"He Knew My Name","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdjliu\/he_knew_my_name\/","flair":null,"author":"Bucks_0","selftext":"I still see him everywhere I go.

Either he was found before dinner, or hands and feet started washing up on the bank. \n\n\n\nHikers phoned in. They saw the kid on the north side of the river, stumbling and panicked, running from something.\n\nThey said he’d been screaming for Mom. \n\n\n\nI was on nights and lumped into the search party since nothing crazy happens in this town. A couple of domestics, home invasions, and bar fights are usually what I have to attend to, so a search party didn’t seem too bad. Plus, on nights lunch was covered. \n\n\n\nI took my squad car out on the dirt roads behind the Jackson’s farm, the only man-made paths leading into the forest. \n\nI thought that, for once in this town, I could have a quiet night, free from all the broken glass and crying kids. Free from cars getting broken into. Free from the chairs being thrown at the pub. \n\nLooking back, I would've done anything to get those calls that night.\n\n\n\nI set out on foot and got pretty far out onto the riverbank, sweeping the area with my flashlight.

Together.”\n\nHe knew my name.\n\nI did what he said.\n\nMy hands shook so badly that I could barely feel the buttons under my fingers.\n\nI pressed them both.\n\nHeard the click.\n\nThe gun finally came free.\n\nBut I never pointed it at him. I didn’t even say anything. I watched as he climbed out of the bush and came up to me, inches from me. \n\nHis smile never gave up. \n\nThen he leaned in for a whisper, close enough to feel his breath against my cheek.\n\n“You’ll never find him,” he said.\n\nCalm.\n\nCertain.\n\nLike it wasn’t even a question.\n\nHe didn’t touch me.\n\nHe didn’t even look at me again.\n\nHe just turned, slow as anything, and started walking back into the trees. \n\nI didn’t call for any backup. \n\nI didn’t chase after him. \n\nI stood there frozen in fear like a little boy.\n\nI found my path back to my truck and started it.

Just rolled my eyes while pouring myself a mug of coffee.\n\nThat’s when the doorbell rang.\n\nI thought it was the party decorations I'd ordered and headed toward the door.\n\nStrangely, the delivery person was already gone, even though I had taken no more than ten seconds to reach the handle.\n\nOn the porch, lying on the doormat, was a letter envelope—paper, but clearly containing something inside.\n\nCurious, I picked it up and opened it.\n\nInside was a small scrap of paper, like a torn-off page, and a slender black object I couldn’t immediately identify.\n\nI pulled out the note first. In messy handwriting, it read:\n\n*Big day today baby.*\n\nA chill shot down my spine as I read those words. It sounded a lot like him.\n\n“Could this be father?” was all I could think, and for a few seconds, I stood there, frozen.\n\n“No, it can’t be!” I said aloud, snapping out of it.\n\nThen I turned my attention to the object. It didn’t look like anything familiar.\n\nI gently pulled it out, feeling its softness and inspecting it carefully. But I soon dropped it—and screamed when I realized what it was.\n\nA finger. It looked like a pinky. \n\nBlackened with rot, nail missing, the smell unbearable.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Do you want to cancel it?” my mother asked, as the police officers left our house. “The party, you know”\n\n“No, I don’t,” I replied, slightly annoyed by the question.\n\nThis was supposed to be the first normal birthday I’d had since we escaped his grasp. I’d invited all my coworkers.\n\n“The cops said they’d keep an eye out for him. They even gave me their personal numbers,” I reassured her, though it didn’t seem to help.\n\nShe sat at the table with her hands covering her mouth, anxious. It reminded me of those nights she used to wait for him to come home after hours at the bar—just to find out what kind of punishment he’d decide to unleash.\n\n“Besides,” I added, “we don’t even know for sure if it’s him.”\n\n“It’s him, honey,” she said firmly, eyes drifting off as if lost in a flashback. “We may not know whose finger that was, but you know damn well why it’s a finger.”\n\nI saw tears start to form in her eyes and walked over.\n\n“Even if it is him,” I said, placing my hands gently on her shoulders, “the police will catch him.”\n\nI don’t know if she believed me or not, but she stood up and quietly went to her room.\n\nIt was almost noon now, and I decided to start setting up our living room for my birthday party later that evening.\n\nI did everything while trying to push the incident out of my mind—but a voice kept echoing in my head:\n\n*“Will we ever be free from him?”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe rest of the afternoon went by smoothly.\n\nSnacks and drinks were on point. The tacky decorations I had ordered from Amazon finally arrived.\n\nI took a long, hot shower and got dressed to welcome the first guests. My mother had also come out of her room, wearing a long white dress I hadn’t seen her in for years.\n\nThe last time she wore something like that, it hadn’t ended well with dad.\n\nMy two closest friends were among the first to arrive, and I couldn’t resist pulling them aside to explain what was going on.\n\n“Oh my god, Maria,” one of them gasped, shaken. “Do you think he’s watching you or something?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I replied. “But I’ve been texting the officer all afternoon. They’re patrolling the neighborhood. They’ve been looking for him for a long time now.”\n\n“But why a finger?” the other asked, intrigued.\n\nI didn’t answer. I just turned and looked over at my mother, who was seated, chatting with a friend.\n\nMy friends followed my gaze—and understood immediately. My mother was holding her beer glass with her right hand, and it was missing a finger—her pinky.\n\n“The first time she tried to leave him, she packed everything in a suitcase while he was at work and we drove away,” I began, trying not to let the wave of emotion take over. “He found us at some crappy roadside motel and cut her finger off as punishment.”\n\nMy friends, probably not prepared for the intensity of what they’d just heard, went silent—eyes wide in disbelief.\n\n“Jonathan should be here with the cake any minute,” I said suddenly, shifting tone, taking a sip of wine, trying to steer the mood back toward normalcy.\n\nI tried to lighten the atmosphere, chatting with the other guests, refilling drinks, playing upbeat music. I told myself this was my day, and I wouldn’t let him take it from me again.\n\nThen the doorbell rang.\n\nMy heart lifted a little. It had to be Jonathan with the cake. \n\nBut when I opened the door, it wasn’t him.\n\nIt was just another guest, a coworker.\n\n“How are you doing, birthday girl?” she said casually, stepping in with a bottle of wine in hand and giving me a kiss on the cheek. \n\n“By the way, I found this lying on the ground in front of your door,” she said, while handing me a plain envelope. “Thought it might be important.”\n\nMy hands were steady, but inside, everything went cold. I took the envelope, nodding as if it were nothing. It was similar to the last one. \n\nIt was another ripped piece of paper, the same messy handwriting. Thankfully, no finger this time. The message read:\n\n*Your present is coming baby*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI forced a smile for the guests, trying not to alarm anyone. “Excuse me for a moment,” I said softly and slipped away to my room.\n\nOnce inside, I closed the door and grabbed my phone. My hands were shaking as I texted the police officer, asking if someone could check my house now—just to be sure.\n\nThen I called Jonathan. He didn’t pick up.\n\nI called again. Still nothing.\n\nPanic began to creep in. He was meant to pick up my birthday cake, and I hadn’t heard a word from him all day. Something felt off.\n\nA soft knock on the door made me flinch. It was my mom.\n\n“You alright?” she asked gently, stepping inside.\n\nI nodded, though my trembling hands said otherwise. Without speaking, I handed her the envelope.\n\nShe read the note inside and went quiet. Her gaze drifted into the distance, her expression hollow. \n\n“He’ll only stop when I’m dead,” she murmured, before breaking down in tears.\n\nI rushed to her and held her tight as she wept in my arms.\n\nWe were interrupted, though, by a voice calling out from the door:\n\n“Hey, Maria! The cake is here!”\n\nI jolted upright. Jonathan must be here.  “Let’s go, mom,” I hurried out, heart pounding, only to find the guests looking at each other, confused.\n\n“We heard the doorbell,” one of my friends said. “And we opened it, but there was just this box sitting on the doormat. I guess someone just left it here.”\n\nAt the front door, a cake box was lying there on the floor—white, sealed, with the bakery’s logo printed on top. \n\nI grabbed it and set it on the kitchen counter—only to feel something wet on my fingers.\n\nA drop. Thick and dark red. \n\nThe silence took over the room. I could feel every gaze on me as I carefully untied the bow and opened the box.\n\nI felt sick to my stomach wondering what was inside, but I forced myself to lift the lid.\n\nAnd, as you can imagine, there wasn’t a cake.\n\nThere was a face. A head.\n\nFreshly severed—the color still vivid. Eyes closed, mouth slightly open.\n\nIt was a head I recognized instantly. The one that had haunted our daily lives with fear for so long. My father’s.\n\nAnd stapled to his forehead, the same kind of torn paper as before, with the same crooked handwriting. It read:\n\n*Happy birthday Maria*"},"89":{"title":"The Shuffle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdpttx\/the_shuffle\/","flair":null,"author":"Ill_Scallion_3972","selftext":"My mind stirs in static.

Everything is in its place. *Too* in its place.  \nBut something feels wrong… something *is* wrong…\n\nI blink.  \nOnce.  \nTwice.  \nThree times.  \nShe doesn’t change. Her face doesn’t flicker. Her movements appear normal, precise, perhaps a bit too precise. Like they’ve been practiced. Rehearsed, thousands of times.  \nI feel a chill run down my spine.  \n*That isn’t her.*  \nI don’t know how I know. I just… do.\n\nA pressure builds in my skull, like something trying to force its way out. And then,  \nIt hits me.  \nA memory... no… knowledge... like it was injected directly into my head...\n\nEveryone’s consciousness shuffles. Every 24 hours.  \nMemories wiped. Personalities replaced. Beliefs, instincts, identities, all swapped into fresh bodies like hand-me-down clothes. Perfectly tailored to what was there before.  \nThey don’t know.  \nThey think they’re still themselves.  \nBut they aren’t.\n\nEveryone around mem my classmates, my neighbors, my family. They’re someone else now, wearing a mask made of leftover flesh and old smiles.  \nSociety goes on normally… like nothing happened… Laughter. Commutes. Conversations. Dates. Arguments. Birthdays.  \nIt all continues.  \nBecause they believe it.  \nBecause they don’t remember.\n\nExcept me.  \nI remember everything.  \nI’m the anomaly. The *only* anomaly. I’m not supposed to be here.  \nI see through them.  \nAnd something sees through *me*.\n\nIt started with a shape. A wrong shape. A silhouette of something tall and narrow, with limbs like sticks snapped at the joints. Skin darker than shadow. A mouth too wide, grinning. Teeth too straight. Too white. Too clean.  \nIt smiled at me.  \nAnd it hasn’t stopped.\n\nI can feel it now, just beyond the veil of normality, waiting, watching, coiling behind the curtains of reality.  \nI don’t sleep anymore.  \nAnd every day is the same.  \nEveryone plays their role.  \nThey smile. They wave. They speak with voices that sound *almost* right.  \nBut I know.  \nI watch.\n\nAnd then…  \nSomething changes.  \nThey start acting wrong even for who they think they are. Not like imposters anymore. Not like people.  \nLike puppets whose strings are being pulled by something curious. Something playful.\n\nI lock eyes with a stranger across the hallway.  \nThey grin.  \n*That* grin.  \nThe one from the thing.\n\nOne by one, they begin to turn.  \nTheir smiles widen.  \nTheir eyes hollow.  \nThey stop pretending.  \nThey surround me. Familiar faces peeled back to show… *it* underneath.\n\nI don’t breathe.  \nThey do. In perfect rhythm.  \nAnd then they speak.\n\n“You know too much.”\n\nNot voices.  \n*Voice.*  \nSingular. Unified. Ancient. Rotting.  \nIt doesn’t echo, it *blooms* inside my skull, wet and pulsing, worming between neurons.  \nI scream, but it echoes with me, not against me.\n\nI claw at my face.  \nMy mouth foams.  \nI want to die.  \nI am unraveling.\n\nThe world bends—my kitchen becomes my classroom becomes my bedroom becomes a cage. A simulation glitching at the seams.  \nI see through the walls now. Through skin. Through time.  \nMy body twitches. Laughs. Sobs. Giggles.  \nI feel a thousand hands pressed against my bones from the inside.\n\nEmotions I’ve never had flood in, rage, ecstasy, terror, lust, grief—screaming together in a language of pain.  \nMy fingernails fall off.  \nMy gums bleed from smiling.\n\nAnd then… blackness.  \nBut…  \nNot death.  \nJust black.  \nI’m still conscious… but I can’t see anything…\n\nAnd the blackness speaks.  \nWhispers, soft… but disturbing:\n\n“Just the beginning. It is just the beginning.”\n\nI see its mouth again.  \nThat grin.  \nI knew…  \nI’ll always know.  \nBecause I’m the only anomaly…  \nThe only one.  \nIt’ll be watching. Waiting. Hungry.  \nIt always will be.\n\nAnd then…  \nI wake up.\n\nMy mind stirs in static. Fog. Gray.  \nNot just the absence of memory…  \nthe absence of *well.. me*.  \nThe dream I was in disintegrates before I can grasp it, like dead ash between my fingers. I don’t know my name. Not right away. I don’t even feel alarmed. Not yet.  \nA voice calls out, syrup-sweet and distant.  \n“Breakfast’s ready, sweetheart. You’ll be late for school.”  \nIt’s my mother.\n\nLike always. ;)  \n\n\nPlease give me a rating :3"},"90":{"title":"We Met Modding a Horror Subreddit. She Disappeared.

Most were fake, but the effort behind them? Impressive. We’d sticky the best ones, ban low-effort “creepypasta LARPs,” and message each other long into the night about the videos that actually felt wrong.\n\nThat’s how I got to know Zara.\n\nHer username was @CallHer.Zara. She lived in Boston. Graphic designer and writer. Obsessed with glitch effects and typography. She always had this way of writing that felt… offbeat. Her messages were full of parentheses and em dashes and late-night thoughts that lingered too long. She’d send me short videos—her walking through snow, her hands shaking as she filmed flickering streetlights. Nothing performative. Just raw.\n\nI live in Asheville. We never met in person. But it didn’t matter.\n\nWe talked every day. Texted before bed. She sent me voice memos and videos when she couldn’t sleep—softly whispering about dreams she’d had where faces were smooth like porcelain or people only existed when being watched. Sometimes we FaceTimed. She always kept her room dark, lit only by the blue light of her screen.\n\nThe connection felt real. So real I started making plans. Looking up flights. She even joked she’d move south if she could find a job that didn’t chain her to a Boston office.\n\nThen, without warning, she vanished.\n\nNo goodbye. No explanation. Just silence.\n\nI thought maybe something had happened—an accident, a family emergency. But her Reddit account was gone. Deleted. Same with her Discord. Every photo she’d sent me disappeared from my phone. Even our saved chats were empty. Just blank message bubbles with no text.\n\nI tried to retrace her online presence. But there was nothing. No LinkedIn. No Instagram. No cached posts. It was like I’d been texting a ghost.\n\nI still had one thing left: a backup folder. I’d saved a few of her videos there. One was my favorite—just her walking past an old church at night, humming some off-key lullaby.\n\nWhen I opened it…\n\nIt wasn’t her.\n\nIt was me.\n\nNot filming, not reacting—just sitting. Alone. In my room. Eyes wide open. Blank. Staring at the camera like I’d been caught mid-blink.\n\nThe file metadata said it had been recorded three days ago.\n\nAt 3:03 a.m.\n\nI don’t remember that.\n\n⸻\n\nI didn’t sleep for days. I became obsessed with proving she was real.\n\nI texted an old coworker she’d once mentioned. He didn’t know who I was talking about. I even emailed the subreddit admins asking if they could restore old mod logs. They said there was no record of a mod named CallHer.Zara.\n\nI posted on r\/AskReddit. Just a simple question: “Anyone remember a user named callher.zara?”\n\nThe post vanished in seconds. Not removed—just gone.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to a package on my doorstep. No address. No stamp.\n\nInside was a VHS tape labeled “CUT 23.”\n\nI don’t own a VHS player. But my neighbor does. She’s this older woman who runs estate sales. I asked if we could use hers. She said sure, then offered to watch with me.\n\nShe didn’t last long.\n\nThe footage was black and white. Shaky. Filmed inside a dim room. The only light was a flickering CRT TV in the corner. The tape zoomed slowly toward the screen—where someone, me or someone like me, was sitting in a chair. Still. Unblinking.\n\nZara’s voice played over it. Barely a whisper.\n\n“He wears your face until you forget what it looked like.”\n\nThe image flickered. A new face appeared—mine, again, but… wrong. Skin too smooth. Eyes too big. Smiling like he didn’t understand what smiling meant.\n\nMy neighbor shut off the tape. She was pale.\n\n“That’s not you,” she said.\n\n⸻\n\nI started reading about Capgras syndrome. A rare disorder where people believe someone close to them has been replaced by an imposter. But the more I read, the more I wondered—\n\nWhat if it works in reverse?\n\nWhat if your mind replaces someone who never existed?\n\nWhat if your brain creates a person-shaped placeholder just to fill the loneliness?\n\nI went to a psychiatrist. I told him everything.\n\nHe nodded too slowly. His voice was calm, rehearsed. He told me what I wanted to hear:\n\nThat trauma can invent memories.\n\nThat love and grief can play dress-up in your head.\n\nThat “Zara” might’ve been a delusion born out of isolation, screen addiction, parasocial hunger.\n\nI asked if hallucinations can leave physical evidence. He asked what I meant.\n\nI showed him the VHS.\n\nHe smiled too wide.\n\n“You’re almost rendered,” he said.\n\nAnd then his face twitched—just slightly, like a corrupted video buffer.\n\n⸻\n\nThat night, I found a folder on my desktop I didn’t create.\n\nInside: over a hundred stills. From different angles. All of them of me.\n\nSitting. Sleeping. Typing. All from webcam angles.\n\nIn the last one, I’m not alone.\n\nSomeone is behind me, touching my shoulder.\n\nShe has Zara’s smile.\n\nAnd my eyes.\n—————————-\/——\nUpdate:\n\nI logged into Reddit this morning. There’s a new subreddit in my list.\n\nr\/hometapeshorror23\n\nIt only has one post.\n\nA live stream.\n\nOf me.\n\nTyping this.\n"},"91":{"title":"Cold Basement or Hot Attic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdiykv\/cold_basement_or_hot_attic\/","flair":null,"author":"SubstantialBite788","selftext":"“…. a cold basement or a hot attic?” bellowed the plump real-estate agent. Bob was a last-minute arrangement, our original agent hospitalized with a mysterious illness.\n\nI missed the first part of his statement; I was ruminating about how big a television I could fit on the opposing wall.\n\n“What?” I asked, perplexed at the odd choice presented to me and my wife.\n\nJudy touched me on my shoulder in such a way as to show her disapproval.\n\n“I said, would you rather be trapped in a cold basement or a hot attic?”\n\n“Neither” I answered, wishing I would have obeyed my wife’s nudging.\n\n“Yeah, tough choice. I don’t know myself. Most folks are a little scared of basements. Say they’re creepier than attics, but attics are hot as hell and I’m a fat sum bitch. Not the predator I once was. I think… no I know I prefer a nice cool basement.”\n\n“Can we see the rest of the house?” I asked.\n\n“I think I’ve seen enough,” my wife interjected.\n\n“Oh, folks don’t worry. You’re going to see the rest of the house, especially the basement or the attic, whichever you choose.” He started howling with laughter, throwing his head back in uncontrollable excitement.\n\nMy wife stomped over to the front door.\n\n“Come on honey. I’m ready to go. This house is not for me.”\n\nShe twisted the doorknob and pulled.\n\n“What the hell!!! Why is the door locked?” She felt around for the dead bolt, her nervous hand looking for a ready escape.\n\n“It’s locked from the outside. The only way out is through the basement or the attic,” explained Bob.\n\n“Alright man. Open that damn door!” I demanded.\n\n“Hey, watch this.” Bob opened the basement door, went through and shut the door behind. The sound of his heavy footsteps diminished as he descended the stairs.\n\n“I didn’t even want to see this house. Did you?” Judy asked. “I’m scared. This guy’s a freak.”\n\n“He told me you had wanted to see this house,” I answered.\n\nWe stood in silence; both lost in overwhelming fear. The house was ancient and dilapidated, nothing akin to what my wife usually preferred. She was about modern, the next best thing, always looking toward the future, never reminiscing. The past was old-fashioned, restrictive, and dull. It was odd for her to even consider such a house, but maybe, I thought, she was trying to compromise, to at least entertain what I might want.\n\nWe looked at each other and started to move toward the kitchen when we heard him stomping down the stairs. He appeared from behind the wall with an axe in his hands.\n\n“Ta-dah!! Magic!”\n\nWe ran toward the kitchen. I could hear him picking up his pace, and I loud thump as I imagined he jumped from the stairs to the landing.\n\n“No way out through the kitchen!!”\n\nUnfortunately, he was right. No windows nor door of any kind.\n\n“Told you!” He was blocking the exit, axe in hand, with large, crimson eyes. His appearance was paler than before, like a snake about to shed its skin.\n\nHe lunged forward and swung the axe in my direction but tripped as the axe missed its mark and fell to the floor. We hurried past him as he convulsed on the floor. I noticed he wore no shoes. His feet were covered in dark, matted hair, the toes stiffening and growing longer. I heard bones cracking and flesh crawling. Bob writhed in pain but also laughed with glee. I pushed Judy through the doorway and as I stepped out into the hallway I felt a sharp thump across my calf. The axe bounced and rolled across the floor. It was a superficial cut but Bob was enamored with his aim.\n\n“Got him. What a shot. I’m an old fat wolf. Got to use a little human ingenuity. Now I got a wounded rabbit in a trap.” He laughed and growled, and pounded his fist against the floor, seemingly glued in place, unable to commence his chase.\n\nI grabbed the axe and hobbled after Judy, who had started to climb the stairs.\n\n“Why are you going upstairs?”\n\n“He said the only way out is through the attic or the basement, and I’m not going down there,” she yelled as she pointed toward the basement door.\n\n“He’s lying Judy.”\n\n“Well maybe there’s a window we can climb out of.” She turned abruptly and ran up the stairs.\n\n“No, not the damn attic,” Bob yelled, his voice deeper and more sinister.\n\nWe rummaged through all the rooms upstairs. There was no way out. The only windows we found were not big enough to fit through. I ran back to the stairs ready to slide down the railing if I had to, but Bob was blocking our way. b\n\nHe was noticeably taller, his torso elongated, but the bulge of his belly unaffected. A beast both fat and slim. His arms were long and thin, but his legs were proportionally shorter. He looked fierce and yet comical. He was a tall man with extremely short legs. The back of his hands rested against the steps like an ape standing in the jungle. Although his face was hairy, it still resembled the real-estate agent that we first encountered.\n\n“I’m an old wolf. I take a little bit more time than I used to.”\n\n“Sort of like erectile disfunction,” I blurted out.\n\n“Fuck you!  Boy, you should have seen me in my younger days. Oh yeah. I’d go from man to beast in a heartbeat and rip a motherfucker’s head off in no time. And I’m gonna do the same to you two. Laughing at me and shit!”\n\nJudy tugged at my shirt and pulled me away. She pointed to a set of stairs leading up to the attic. I shook my head no, but she turned and darted up the stairs. I followed and stumbled across the threshold, dropping the axe to the floor. Judy slammed the door shut and locked it.\n\n“Why did you come up here?”\n\n“What, you wanted to go through him?” she asked. “You said that the attic had to be connected to the basement. There’s no way out up here. There’s only one room left to check.”\n\nThe walls were light pine bespattered with dried blood, some spots darker than others, indicating a long history of successful hunts, an extensive group of victims caught in the trap. The roof was high on one side of the room and slanted deeply to a low height on the other side. One could touch the rafters standing flat-footed. The same small windows that were in the other rooms were situated near the top of the ceiling on the high end of the roof. They allowed a precious amount of light into the attic.\n\nWe thoroughly searched the room, every nook and every damn cranny, but to no avail. We looked for hidden contraptions, levers, or buttons. Nothing. We were trapped.\n\n“There has to be a way,” I reasoned.\n\nJudy’s eyes grew wide. She whimpered and started backing away.  \n\nI turned. The room had grown darker. The contrast between the darkness of the room and crimson eyes staring at us from a crack in the wall was stark, and chilling. A long hairy arm pushed open a panel in the wall. A monstrous werewolf pushed through the opening and crouched down to avoid the slanting roof. It reached up and pulled a lever in the rafters that slammed the panel shut tight. It lumbered toward us, limping as it made its way toward us. The beast’s face was illuminated by slanting ray of light. The face of a human was barely discernible. His eyes and cheeks were swollen. Blood sprayed from his mouth and nostrils with each labored breath. Two sharp canines protruded from his upper jaw. I noticed immediately the cause of his limp. One leg was much shorter than the other. Bob’s erectile dysfunction was worse than he thought.\n\n“Nowhere to run to little bunnies. This is almost poetic. You have to watch me change into the beast that’s going to rip you apart.” He fell to the floor, arching his back in pain, his leg twisting and contorting to a new and final shape.\n\nI knew that this was our only chance. I had to strike now while he was vulnerable, like a snake in the midst of swallowing its prey. I ran over and grabbed the axe and hurled it up over my head. I swung down as hard as I could into the monster’s neck. It shuddered and snapped at my ankles. I jumped back and proceeded to slam the axe into its side, hoping I was far enough away to avoid its bite. It grabbed my ankle and pulled me to the floor. It dragged me across the floor. Bob’s nose was now more of a snout, a disfigured face, a clump of hair flesh with sharp pointed teeth. He clamped down on my already wounded calf. The bite was intense and strong. When I moved, he bit down harder.\n\n“Run Judy! Go, get out of here.”\n\nI felt the axe slip away from my loose grip. This was the end. I would fight like hell to keep Judy alive. I’d wrestle the devil to keep him occupied. As I resigned myself to the struggle, I saw a glint of light reflected from the edge of the axe above me. The edge of the axe sunk deep into the face of the beast. Its bite grew weak, its grip loosened. I freed myself and struggled to my feet. I grabbed the axe from Judy and begin hacking. I hacked and hacked until I wore myself out, until I knew there was no way this thing was still alive, or at least, if it was alive, it was too crippled to do a damn thing.\n\nJudy and I made our way to the spot in the wall where we saw it enter. I looked up and saw an obvious lever. Of course, now I see it. I reached up and pulled the lever. The panel on the wall popped open. We slowly made our way downstairs, Judy in front of me bearing some of my weight.\n\nWhen we got to the bottom of the stairs, we didn’t encounter a dark, dank basement, but instead, we found a nice den with antique furniture and a big screen television, with a long ornate bar stocked with high end liquor and wine. There was plush blue carpet and shelves stocked full of collectible action figures, pristine and in their original packaging. On the other side was a door leading to the backyard.\n\nI took a bottle of whiskey from the bar and limped out the door. Before I could lift the bottle to my mouth Judy snatched it away and took a full swig of whiskey. She turned and looked at me and smiled.\n\n“I guess he was right. The basement was the way to go.”"},"92":{"title":"My phone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdg6ar\/my_phone\/","flair":null,"author":"b2kdaman","selftext":"I’ve never really believed in anything paranormal.

I'm not an internet guy or into posts, I'm a taxi driver just getting by, living day by day, and making a living isn't easy. But what happened to me... I don't know how to describe it. Something stranger than fiction, and more terrifying than any movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm telling this here because... I honestly don't know why. Maybe to warn someone, maybe so someone will believe me, maybe so my conscience can rest a little before... before I don't know what might happen. I won't say my name or where I am now, because I'm scared. Truly scared.\n\nThe story began a few days ago, maybe a week, maybe ten days, time has blurred for me. It was an ordinary night like any other. Few customers, hot weather, and you're just struggling to make enough for gas and the car rental. I was parked in a somewhat deserted spot, waiting for any fare to break the boredom. It was nearing one in the morning. Suddenly, I saw someone waving at me from a distance. He looked a bit strange. Tall and thin, wearing ordinary clothes but they looked like they weren't his, a bit loose on him, and his eyes... his eyes were frighteningly empty. Like he was looking through you, not at you.\n\nI thought, Come on, any fare will do. I stopped for him. He opened the door next to me and sat down. He didn't even return my greeting. He was quiet for a moment, and I waited for him to tell me where he wanted to go. Nothing. I looked at him in the rearview mirror, found him staring straight ahead, completely zoned out.\n\nI said to him: \"Sir? Where to?\"\n\nHe looked at me slowly, as if turning his neck required immense effort. His voice was low and strange, like someone who hadn't spoken in a long time: \"Drive.\"\n\nI was surprised. \"Drive... drive where? I need a destination, boss.\"\n\nHis eyes went back to staring straight ahead. \"Just drive. Anywhere.\"\n\nI thought to myself: \"This guy looks like he's high on something, or crazy.\" But still, money is money. And the customer looked like he'd pay well, maybe he wasn't from around here or was lost. I decided to drive him around a bit until he made up his mind, or maybe he was waiting for a phone call or something.\n\nI turned on the meter and drove. I entered a quiet side street. The car moved slowly, and silence filled the space. I'm used to this silence, but with this customer, the silence was heavy. Very heavy. I felt like there was a mountain sitting next to me, not a human being. Every now and then, I'd glance in the mirror and find him in the same state, staring ahead coldly, his eyes unblinking, like a statue.\n\nAfter about ten minutes, while we were on another side street, a bit narrower and brighter than the last one, I suddenly saw him slowly raise his right hand, and point at a man walking on the opposite sidewalk. The man looked completely ordinary, maybe heading home from work, walking with a bag in his hand. The passenger pointed at him with his index finger, without uttering a word.\n\nAnd suddenly, the man on the sidewalk... fell. Fell flat on his face, all at once, like a stage prop. The bag in his hand burst open, and its contents scattered on the ground. I slammed on the brakes out of shock. The car shuddered to a halt.\n\nI looked at the passenger in disbelief: \"What was that?? That man fell! Did you see?\"\n\nHe was completely unfazed. Didn't take his eyes off the fallen man. Soon, I saw people gathering around the man, and the sound of screaming started to rise. Someone yelled: \"Ambulance! Someone call an ambulance!\"\n\nMy heart was pounding like a drum. I looked at the passenger again, and saw him lower his hand with utmost calm, then look straight ahead again as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Sir... do you know that man?\" I asked him in a shaky voice.\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Sir! I'm talking to you...\"\n\nHe cut me off with the same low, terrifying voice: \"Drive.\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my entire body. This wasn't normal. What was wrong with this man? And what was this bizarre coincidence? He points at someone, and they fall? No, this wasn't a coincidence. My mind refused to believe there was a connection, but my gut told me no, something was wrong. Very wrong.\n\nI told myself: \"man, calm down, maybe the man was sick, maybe he fainted, it's a coincidence, man.\" I tried hard to convince myself. I stepped on the gas and drove off, my eyes glued to the rearview mirror, watching the spot where the man fell and the crowd gathering around him.\n\nWe continued driving in an even heavier silence. This time, I couldn't take my eyes off him in the mirror. I watched his every move with fear. He remained perfectly still. Another ten minutes, fifteen minutes... I don't remember. I entered a slightly busy main street. Cars were moving slowly, side by side.\n\nSuddenly, he made the same gesture again. He raised his right hand, but this time he pointed at the driver of a transport truck driving next to us. The driver was a young guy, playing loud music and singing along. The passenger pointed at him.\n\nA second... two... the truck next to us suddenly swerved sharply to the right, as if the driver had lost consciousness, and crashed into a car parked on the side of the road. The sound of the crash was incredibly loud, and the whole street came to a standstill.\n\nMy entire body jolted. I looked at the truck, saw the driver's head slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. People started shouting and running towards the accident.\n\nI turned to the passenger, feeling the blood drain from my face. \"You... what did you do?? What are you doooing?!\" My voice was loud this time, and I couldn't control it.\n\nHe looked at me with the same coldness. That deadly coldness. And said one sentence: \"He chose.\"\n\n\"Chose what?? What are you talking about?! Do you have something to do with what's happening?!\"\n\nHe looked straight ahead again. \"Drive.\"\n\nThis time, I was truly scared. Not just anxious or bewildered. This was real fear. This man wasn't a normal human being. There was something demonic about him. Coincidence doesn't repeat itself twice in exactly the same way. He points, and people fall or have terrible accidents. No... not fall. I saw the first man, and I saw this driver. They looked dead.\n\nI thought about opening the door, throwing myself out of the car, and running. I thought about stopping the car, yelling, and drawing people's attention to him. But fear paralyzed me. Fear of the unknown. Fear of him. If he could do that to people on the street with a gesture, what would he do to me if I disobeyed his command?\n\nI kept driving, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. I didn't know where I was going. I entered streets I didn't recognize, lost like a ship without a sail. And he sat silently beside me. His silence now had a sound. A threatening sound. A sound that said every second passing with him in this car was bringing me closer to disaster.\n\nAfter a while, I don't know how long, maybe half an hour, maybe more, we were in a dimly lit, working-class neighborhood, the houses packed tightly together. The streets barely wide enough for one car. There was an old woman walking alone on the side of the road, holding a cane and leaning on it. She looked so frail and poor.\n\nMy heart clenched as I saw him begin to raise his hand again. I told myself \"No! Not her too! She's an old, poor woman!\"\n\nBefore he could point, before I could think what to do, I yelled loudly while looking at him in the mirror: \"Waaaatch out! Don't you do it! Not this woman!\"\n\nHis hand stopped in mid-air for a moment. He looked at me again. This time, I felt like there was a flicker... I don't know what... maybe surprise? Maybe something else I couldn't decipher in those empty eyes.\n\nHe asked in that low voice that terrified me: \"Are you afraid for her?\"\n\n\"She's an old, poor woman! Have mercy! Why are you doing this?? Who are you anyway?!\" I was speaking quickly, fear making it hard to form coherent sentences.\n\nHe kept looking at me for a bit. Then, he slowly lowered his hand. And went back to looking straight ahead. \"Drive.\"\n\nI felt myself breathing again, though with difficulty. The old woman continued on her way, oblivious to everything. We passed her. I kept driving, but this time, I kept circling the same area, not wanting to go far, as if trying to prevent him from finding a new \"prey.\"\n\nI kept driving around for about another hour. He was silent. And I kept glancing at him and at the street, my heart in my throat. Until I got fed up, tired, and my fear reached its peak. I stopped the car suddenly in a dark, empty spot. Turned off the engine. And turned my whole body towards him.\n\n\"Look, I'm not moving another step until I understand. Who are you? And what are you doing to these people? What's your story exactly?!\"\n\nHe remained silent for a few moments, staring ahead. I felt like my heart would stop from the tension. Then, he looked at me. But this time, his gaze was different. As if a piece of the mask he wore had been removed. I sensed a look of... sadness? Or maybe exhaustion? I don't know.\n\nHe said with a strange calmness: \"I see.\"\n\n\"See what?!\"\n\n\"I see what they've done. I see the mark on them.\"\n\n\"Mark?! What mark is this?!\" I started to feel like my head would explode from the questions and the horror.\n\n\"Every one of us has a mark. Like a halo. Its color tells what they've done in their life. Done good, or done evil.\"\n\nThe words weren't registering. Halos? Colors? This was crazy talk!\n\n\"What are you saying? Are you insane?!\"\n\n\"I'm not insane,\" he said with the same calmness. \"I really see it. This halo tells me everything. There are white halos, pure. Those are good, peaceful people. And there are grey halos, those who sinned and repented, or whose lives are half-and-half. And there are... black halos.\"\n\nWhen he said \"black,\" I felt his voice change. There was a tone of... hatred? Or perhaps disgust.\n\nHe continued: \"These black halos belong to people who have truly harmed others. People who destroyed others' lives. People who stole, killed, oppressed... people who don't deserve to walk the earth among the good.\"\n\nI swallowed hard. \"And those people you pointed at... their halos were black?\"\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"The darkest shades of black. People who did things... you can't imagine.\"\n\n\"And you... when you point at them... what happens to them?\" I asked the question knowing the answer, but needing to hear it from him.\n\n\"Their halo goes out. Like a bulb burning out. And their soul leaves their body.\"\n\nHe said it so simply, as if talking about the weather. I felt the world spin around me. This man... wasn't just someone seeing strange things. He was judging people and carrying out the sentence himself. An angel of death walking on two legs? A devil? I didn't know. But what I was sure of was that he was dangerous. Very dangerous.\n\n\"So... so what about me?\" The words escaped me involuntarily. I don't know why I asked. Maybe morbid curiosity? Maybe terror?\n\nHe looked at me again. This time, his eyes stayed focused on me for a long time. I felt like he was piercing me with his gaze. Like he was flipping through all the pages of my past life. I felt a coldness seep into my bones despite the heat outside.\n\n\"You?\" he repeated the word softly.\n\n\"Yes... me. What color halo do you see on me?\" I asked, instantly regretting every letter I uttered.\n\nA faint, but terrifying, smile touched his lips for the first time. It was the ugliest smile I had ever seen in my life.\n\n\"Your halo?\" he said, leaning slightly towards me, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"Your halo... is blacker than night. Blacker than the devil's own heart. One of the worst halos I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nIn that instant, I lost control. All I remember is opening the car door and throwing myself out while it was still stopped. I ran. Ran as fast as I could, without looking back. I could feel his gaze on my back, feel his voice echoing in my ears. \"Blacker than night...\"\n\nI kept running and running until my legs couldn't carry me anymore. I ducked into unfamiliar streets and alleys until I found myself somewhere very far away. I took whatever public transport I could find and went to a distant place, a place where no one knows me. I left the car, left everything.\n\nI'm sitting now in a cheap hotel room, writing this. Why did he say that to me? Why is my halo, specifically, so black?\n\nThere's something... something that happened a long time ago. Many years ago. I was still a reckless young man, needing money. I did something... something terrible. Something I regret every single day of my life. A crime... I was involved in it. A kidnapping... kidnapping a little girl. Things got out of control... and the girl... the girl died. And we... me and the others with me... we got rid of her. Threw her body somewhere no one would ever find it.\n\nNobody knows about this except me and the two guys who were with me. And neither of them will talk. I've lived all these years with this secret, with this guilt. Trying to live normally, trying to forget. But it seems... it seems this guilt leaves a mark that can't be erased. A mark this man was able to see.\n\nHe knows. That man knows what I did. And when he told me my halo was blacker than night, he wasn't just threatening me. He was telling me my turn was coming. That he was going to cleanse the world of me too.\n\nI don't know what to do. Turn myself in? Would they believe me if I told them about the man with the halos? They'd call me crazy. And if I don't tell them... will I live the rest of my life in this terror? Waiting any moment to find him in front of me, pointing his finger... and my halo going out?\n\nWhy did I write all this? Maybe to confess. Maybe so if something happens to me, someone will know the truth. The truth about what I did back then, and the truth about this terrifying man walking our streets, judging people.\n\nIf any of you see a tall, thin man, with empty eyes, walking alone at night... run. Run and don't let him get close to you. And don't let him see your halo.\n\nI don't know what I'll do now. Keep running? Until when? Can he find me? Could he be looking for me right now as I write this?\n\nOh God, protect me. I'm scared. So scared. Someone help me... someone tell me what to do? I feel like my end is near. I feel like he's going to find me.\n\n"},"94":{"title":"Our first date started in a mall. We STILL haven’t seen the sky since.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kd6ep4\/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_still_havent\/","flair":"Series","author":"EclosionK2","selftext":"We broke into a *Menchie’s Yogurt* because why not. \n\nThe **infinite mall** never generated one [before.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1jglces\/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen\/)\n\nIt was Rav's idea to get everyone some fro-yo, and frankly, It was a good call. We barely got any healthy snacks because the mall preferred to generate options like *Pizza Hut* or *Panda Express.*\n\n“Some fruit feels refreshing on the belly, huh?” \n\nRav patted his stomach, and we all nodded in agreement. Sitting down at a *Menchie’s* was a nice reward after reaching the 30 mile mark. \n\nThat’s right, thirty miles.\n\nIt's pretty impressive for exploring an endlessly generating mall for only a week. If it weren’t for the complete darkness, we probably could have been moving even faster.\n\nWe’re currently mapping the northeast sections, then sending our findings to groups B and C via our phones (who were exploring opposite sides of the mall). Our hope is for *someone,* *somewhere,* at *some point* to finally find an exit out of this fucking interminable, god-forsaken endless forever maze. \n\nBut so far it just keeps going. And the further we go, the more details we spot. \n\nLike in the decoration.\n\n“Do you notice the decor getting a little worse the further we go?” Rav gulped a big spoonful of yogurt.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that *Starbucks* across from us doesn’t even have the usual mermaid logo. Look.”\n\nI used my flashlight to glance across the dark food court. Rav was right. The logo was missing. And so was the ‘ucks’. It just said *Starbs.*\n\n“Hmmmm,” Clayton exhaled loudly from his vape, making it clear to the rest of us that he was thinking. “It’s like the mall’s rendering objects with more mistakes the further we go. The more information created, the noisier it gets.”\n\nClayton, Rav, Professor Ed and I were all from the same local University. Except the three of them all pretty high level mathematicians with varying levels of degrees… whereas I was in first year philosophy.\n\n“That probably explains it, yeah.” Rav agreed. “The mall’s generation becomes fuzzier as we go further. Do you think that means it’ll make the food taste worse? Or perhaps in the case of *Pizza Hut…* better?”\n\nI laughed. I couldn’t help myself. Rav had a knack for keeping things light, and I gave his left hand a squeeze.\n\nWe were still technically dating.\n\nRav was the one who invited me on a date here in the first place (back when the mall was still normal), and even though it's been seven days of trying to survive in a very \\*un-\\*normal mall, I still considered Rav my boyfriend.\n\nHe squeezed my hand back.\n\n“Depending on how Mall-Dimension interprets Shannon Entropy,” Clayton said, exhaling more vape smoke, “I believe the food is going to start tasting worse and worse. Just look at what I found here.”\n\nHe lifted a jar of nuts he found at *Menchie’s.* Almonds.\n\nHe turned the jar and pointed at one almond that appeared to be totally stuck, *halfway between the glass of the jar.* Like a log poking through ice.\n\n“I posit that this dimension’s perpetual ability to ‘generate mall aesthetic’ will get sloppier. And I predict that our food is going to be more and more blended with surrounding matter.”\n\nI checked the blueberry tub I was eating from a second ago. It thankfully appeared normal.\n\nRav glanced at his tub of strawberries and found something strange. A white strawberry made of *plastic.*  \n\n“Huh,” Rav said. “So this could mean the further we travel, the more food’s going to mix with nearby material…  and become less edible?”\n\n“Interesting, interesting.” Prof Ed always found ideas he liked *interesting.* “It could also mean the surrounding environment will become less, and less *stable* too… Which means maybe the mall will start showing its cracks—which could lead us to an exit out of this Escher World.”\n\n**Escher World**. **Mall-Dimension.** We all had different names.\n\nI just called it **infinite mall.** \n\n“Well, I guess we should start logging suspicious tastes in food.” Rav eyed his bowl carefully as he finished his meal. “Metal and plaster usually doesn’t sit too well in the ol’ belly.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen we sent our selfies to Groups B and C, there was much jealousy in the group chat about finding fresh fruit. It was a rarer commodity than expected. \n\nIn fact, I packed some of the whole oranges and lemons into my bags, because some tingle in my gut reminded me that “scurvy” was a thing. A disease formerly exclusive to 17th century sailors could actually become a concern in this forever mall.\n\nWeird.\n\nWe travelled in our usual close, four-person formation of flashlights, illuminating not only our front, but both our sides. Prof Ed brought up the rear with the iPad, and slowly sketched out the route for posterity.\n\nOur exploration after lunch took us by *Old Navy, Gap, Zara* and *H&M.*\n\nI hated clothing shops.\n\nI did my best to avoid looking at the mannequins in the windows—who all stared with faceless intensity. It was something about the uncanniness of their human shape that always creeped me out.\n\n*H&M* had the creepiest mannequins near the end. There were these black, shroud-like dresses on display that made the last couple of figures look like straight up *grim reapers.*\n\nThankfully, the fashion strip was short and spit us out into a wide, octagonal plaza. Our flashlights picked up benches, indoor ficus trees, and we heard the gentle streaming of water.\n\nAnother mall fountain.\n\n*Great place to fill up our water,* I thought.\n\nI was halfway through getting my canteen out when Rav’s flashlight swirled around something that was standing by a ficus.\n\n“Hey! Over there! What’s that!” \n\nOur lights converged on the still shape and revealed a person. And not just any person.\n\nIndrek.\n\nIce shot down my back. Instinctively, I made sure my swiss army knife was in my right pocket.\n\nIndrek was the cause of all this.\n\nHe was keynote speaker of the math convention held at the center of this mall. It was his twisted, balding head that solved Gödel’s unprovable theorem in front of all our eyes… and trapped us inside this infinite mess.\n\n“Enjoying our mall’s latest self-expression?” The bald professor gestured to the fountain’s statue between us. “Always impressive to find new sculptures, no?”\n\nRav pulled out his *Cabela’s* hunting knife, and pointed it right at Indrek. “What are you doing here? Are there more of you?”\n\nIndrek lifted his palms up, and walked closer. “There are *always* more of me. But this time they’re all very far away I assure you. I come in peace.”\n\nWe all swapped furrowed glances. \n\n*He comes in peace?* \n\nNone of us were buying it.\n\n“If by peace, you mean you’d like to show us a way out,” Rav motioned to the next hallway, “then please lead the way.” \n\nThe old man's misty, grey-blue eyes widened. “A way out? Yes. That is *exactly* what I am offering. Master Pythagoras would like you all to see him. He has access to the true exit. A return to life outside.”\n\nMy stomach twisted at the word ‘Pythagoras’. The last glimpse I got of the ancient mathematician was when he was riding a palanquin, *draining someone’s mind essence.* \n\n“No, Indrek.” Rav said. “We don’t want anything to do with your ‘master’.”\n\n“With all due respect.” Clayton cautiously vaped. “You wrote an equation that shifted us into this Mall-Dimension. You must have the counter-equation to get us out.”\n\nIndrek laughed. \n\n“It's a lot easier to drop inside a maze—than to find your way out.” He hung his fingers outside the pockets of his old tweed jacket. “I’m afraid there is no *counter-equation.* Only Master has the exit formula. Only Master can let you out.”\n\nRav grit his teeth,, “we’re not going *anywhere* near your fucking ‘*Master’.*”\n\nIndrek took another step closer and rested his foot on the fountain's perimeter. “You all mustn’t be so afraid, Master has long been satiated now, he has drunk enough minds. He *will* offer you an exit.”\n\n“And what if we don't believe you?”  Clayton asked.\n\nIndrek chuckled again. “Well then I suppose you can keep wandering these halls for all eternity. The algorithm I sequenced is truly infinite. There is no way out.”\n\nI didn't like the smug look on Indrek’s face. \n\nFor seven days we’ve been trapped in this mall. Our families in the real world have been worried sick. We’re missing lectures, classes, birthdays, day-jobs… We all just wanted to GTFO.\n\n“You have no right to trap us here!” I yelled, standing just ahead of Rav. \n\nRav channelled my energy and approached even closer with his hunting knife. \n\nIndrek didn’t like this. \n\nOur visitor backed away, slowly pulling out a cue card and pen. “Now, now... No need for hysterics…” \n\nWith small, deft movements he scribbled something on the paper card. Suddenly there came a reflection of Indrek. As if a mirror was summoned by his left side.\n\nOnly it wasn’t a mirror. \n\nIt was another Indrek. \n\nA living copy.\n\n“Let’s stop for a second.” Both Indreks smiled. “Let’s have a discussion here peacefully.”\n\nWe all stared at the duplicates.\n\nIn unison, both Indreks pulled out another set of cue cards and pens. The second Indrek spoke. “Does our discussion require a larger group in attendance?”\n\n*Fuck,* I thought. *Was he just going to multiply himself into a horde?* \n\nBefore I could vocalize the concern, there came a gunshot.\n\nA bloody hole appeared in the second Indrek. The duplicate clutched his chest, and then collapsed. \n\nThe remaining Estonian stared in shock. And before he could react—two more shots rang out.\n\nI backed away and shielded my face, watching Clayton come out with a revolver, pointing at the two crumpled Indreks.\n\nThey both lay lifeless on the floor.\n\nSmoke drifted from the barrel. The gunshot reverberated across the mall. It felt like a whole minute passed before anyone spoke.\n\n“Clayton… ?” Rav stared at the weapon with surprise.\n\nClayton put the safety back on and placed the gun inside his vest pocket. “What? we're just supposed to stand and watch him multiply? So he can outnumber us?”\n\nWe had agreed on *no guns* several days ago. It was meant to be a show of solidarity and safety. \n\nClayton shrugged. “We were at a *Cabela's*. I grabbed a gun.”\n\nSlowly, Rav turned to Prof Ed and myself. “Did… anyone else grab a firearm?”\n\nNo one said anything. Rav sighed.\n\n“I know we voted as a group or whatever,” Clayton sucked on his vape again. “But my dad used to take me to the range. I *know* how to use guns.”\n\nRav stared at the dead duplicates. None of us knew what to say.\n\n“When we link up with the other groups,” Clayton exhaled. “We can vote again or whatever. As far as I’m concerned, I just saved our lives.”\n\nI took a step toward the dead Estonian professors on the floor. The blood was pooling around their heads.  *If both of them were copies, did it mean they were never truly ‘alive’ in the first place?*\n\nProfessor Ed ambled through the awkward silence and fished the cue cards from both of the clones’ dead hands. \n\n“Interesting, interesting. Look at what we have here.”\n\nIt was our first time getting a hold of *any* of the math-work by Indrek. I could see a glimmer of hope suddenly arise in Rav, in Clayton, and especially Prof Ed. We were all thinking the same thing. \n\n“Could we use it to work out the escape formula?”\n\nProfessor Ed held the cards close to his eyes. “Or will it *duplicate* us?”\n\n“Or will it… what?” \n\n“Well the equations Indrek wrote here were for duplication, right?” Ed held out the cue cards for us all to see. \n\nThe equations looked smudged, but mostly visible\n\n∀x(Ex↔(x=β))\n\n“I think we should be very careful with what we write on those cards,” Rav said. “In fact. We should take photos and send them to B and C. So we could all study them.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor the next little while, we decompressed and chilled (I certainly needed to). The three mathies crowded the cards and considered all options. I stood nearby, scanning the dark edges of the mall with my flashlight, keeping watch.\n\n“So if we are the co-factors in the equation,” Clayton waggled one of the cue cards high,  “we can change this 1 into a 4, and the result will account for all *four* of us. Let me show you.”\n\nRav pulled the card away before Clay could start writing. “Hold on, hold on.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I just… I think we should slow down before we write anything. I think there are other answers to write.”\n\nClayton firmly grabbed the card back. “It’s Indrek’s math that got us stuck in here, and It's going to be *Indrek’s math* that gets us out. We’re going to have to try multiple answers. Let’s just get the first guess out of the way.”\n\n“First *guess*?”\n\n“You know what I mean. The first *valid solution* that I stand by. They are all *guesses* in a sense.”\n\nProfessor Ed tapped Rav’s shoulder. “We’ve just spent the last week taking showers with restaurant sinks. I think we can afford to try writing one answer and see what happens.”\n\nI cleared my throat. “But Clayton … do you *actually* have a solution for the math?” \n\nClayton gave me a patronizing look. “Yes. I can make epsilon equate to a specific value. I have an answer that will work.”\n\n“But there’s still other ways to interpret the work.” Rav said. “That could still be wrong.”\n\n“Listen, we can hold an entire congressional caucus and vote on an answer.” Clayton waved the cue card back and forth. “Or we could just write an answer that gets us the fuck out of here.” \n\nProf Ed clapped. “Yes, let’s try something that could get us out.” \n\nRav turned to me for support. \n\nI could tell both Clayton and Ed didn’t really care what I thought—even though I preferred Rav’s approach. But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit there was a large part of me screaming: *let’s just try something to get out!*\n\n“We should write at least one answer,” I said. “To see what happens.”\n\nRav looked disappointed.\n\nClayton grabbed a pen. “Majority rules. Let’s go.”\n\nHe went over to use a bench as a writing surface. Rav and Ed rushed over and joined him, whispering suggestions as he began to write. I could only watch as their backs hunched and blocked my view. I was fulfilling my role as the math-dyslexic philosophy student standing in the back.\n\n“Claudia, You should come over here,” Rav waved. “ If we do create a portal, or exit, or whatever happens, you should be close by so it affects you too.”\n\n*And that’s why we were dating.*\n\nI came over and put a hand on his shoulder.\n\nWe watched as Clayton lowered his pen one more time to write a big letter…\n\n**E**\n\n“ And the answer is… epsilon!”\n\nThe cue card glowed very bright for a half-second. \n\nWe all felt it. \n\nA little reverberation in the air\n\n“So did that… Do anything?”\n\nWe kept quiet. And looked around with our flashlights… Nothing.\n\nThe mall was unnaturally quiet without our sounds. Just a faint buzzing, like the sound of distant fluorescents somewhere. \n\nAnd then, like a bat out of hell—a **scream.**\n\nLoud. \n\nPained.\n\nClayton’ s self-righteous posture deflated, and even Rav looked startled, eyes stretching wide.\n\n“Is that one of ours?… Is someone hurt?”  Professor Ed investigated his iPad quickly, scanning our chats with Group B and C. \n\nAnother scream.\n\nLouder this time.\n\nIt was coming toward us.\n\nWe formed a tight huddle, throwing our light in every direction of the sound.\n\nThere came this bizarre rhythm of slapping footsteps.\n\n*Splick* — *splick splick* — *splick splick splick!*\n\n“Hello?” Rav aimed his light at the center of the fashion hall. \n\nThe mannequins stared back as if they held a secret. *H&M’s* grim reapers looked more menacing than ever.\n\n“Is anyone there?”\n\n*Splick splick splick!*\n\nThen, from behind a trash can. We saw it.\n\nA crawling thing.\n\nA fast moving, sweating mass, wrapped in a familiar brown tweed jacket.\n\nIt was Indrek. Or rather. Half of Indrek. Or rather… *Two halves of Indrek?*\n\nThey were connected together at the waist. A bald head on each opposite side, commanding a pair of bleeding, scampering arms.\n\nWe all retreated with our backs towards the fountain, horrified by this freak of nature.\n\n“Jesus Christ.”\n\n“What the fuck.”\n\nThe malformed thing didn’t seem to like our reaction. Both its heads turned to our direction and screamed frenzied, animalistic screams.\n\nClayton drew his gun. The monster lunged for his legs.\n\n*BLAM! BLAM!* \n\nI turned away to cover my ears. When I looked back, I could see Clayton clicking his pistol over and over. The four armed creature pinned him down. \n\nOne of the Indrek heads clamped down on Clay’s throat\n\n“AUGH!!!”\n\nRav swooped in with his hunting knife, but the other Indrek half was alert—it swiped defensively  and hissed at Rav’s advances.\n\nIt was like fighting a rabid dog on both ends.\n\nWe couldn’t move in to save Clayton without dealing with the hissing other half. So I unzipped my backpack, looking for projectiles. \n\nI emptied out a pile of “anti-scurvy” oranges.\n\n“Quick!” I yelled, and Prof Ed got the idea.\n\nWe armed ourselves and started hucking the fruits.\n\nThe defensive Indrek half shielded its face from our tosses. Rav moved in and hacked.\n\nWithin two swipes, the Indrek was mortally wounded. Its neck started bleeding profusely. When the other half of the creature turned to face us, Rav wasn’t messing around. He kept stabbing\n\nThe wanton gore was brutal. The monster fought back and clawed, but Rav just grit his teeth.\n\nVery soon we ran out of oranges. \n\nThe double-Indrek was dead. \n\nRav kept stabbing into the lifeless creature until he finally took a step back and focused on his breathing. He looked totally overwhelmed with adrenaline.\n\nProf Ed ran over and pulled the thoroughly dead thing off of Clayton, checking for vital signs of the young university student.\n\n“Christ on a cross…” Ed said.\n\nClayton’s throat had been totally *shredded.* You could practically see the neck vertebrae beyond the throat. It was Imagery even to this day I could never wipe from my brain.\n\n“Oh boy.” Professor Ed tugged at his goatee reflexively. He looked even more devastated than Rav. “…Oh no…Oh Clayton …. Oh no…”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe washed our blood-stained faces and hands in the fountain.\n\nThree marble cherubs continually spat out the water and cleansed us of the ample violence surrounding the plaza. There were now two dead clone Indreks, one dead Clayton, and one dead double-Indrek freak circling the marble pool.\n\nWe waited to see if something else would come screaming towards us, some other malformed unholy from the depths. But it appeared Clayton’s math guess had only formed one monster.\n\nAfter ten minutes of silence, we finished up our washing. \n\nRav snagged a couple replacement pants and shirts from the nearby *H&M,* while Ed and I procured several large duvet covers. We had not anticipated a sudden death among our ranks, and none of us were quite sure how to go about it.\n\nWe wrapped up Clayton’s body in three sets of covers, then bound the whole thing with rope and duct tape.\n\nThere was no way we could carry Clayton for very long, and our splinter groups were almost sixty miles in the opposite direction—so we weren’t about to reconvene for a funeral either. \n\nSo we did the next most sensible thing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe carried Clayton’s remains into the back of a *Sleep Country*, where he was laid down on a king-size mattress. There was even an angel figure carved into the headboard.\n\nAs his former instructor, Professor Ed gave a small eulogy.\n\n“Clayton, I only knew you for two terms. Your first essays showed me lots of potential, and your most recent ones conveyed a strong understanding of classical physics. You had a full life ahead of you. And though you may have been young, naive and maybe stubborn—you were also brave. Let us not waste your bravery. Let’s keep moving. We will honor you by finding our own way freedom from this … god-forsaken mall. Amen.”\n\nProbably because he knew Clayton pretty well, Ed wanted to be alone for a while and went to lie on a distant mattress.\n\nI felt the same vibe.\n\nMy heart was in my throat, vibrating from all the leftover panic.  Rav and I laid on a queen size mattress and held each other for a small eternity.\n\n“Are we going to die here?” I eventually asked.\n\nRav held his breath. The delay in his response was all I needed to hear.\n\n“No. We'll keep going. We’ll find a way out, don’t worry.”\n\n“Be honest with me though. Do you really think there is a way out?”\n\nAgain. That delay in his response.\n\n“I think now that we’ve sent the formula we found to groups B and C… someone will figure it out.

The further we travel, the less stable the environment will become… So we’re going to find *some* kind of crack. There will be an escape.”\n\nI didn’t like the sound of the **infinite mall** becoming less stable, but if it meant that we could find a way out, I’d have to accept it.\n\n“You’re really good at clinging to the bright side.” I said.\n\n“I am?” He seemed genuinely surprised.\n\n“Yeah. It helps.”\n\n“Well, between being stupidly optimistic versus brutally realistic. I’d rather edge on being stupid.”\n\n“You’re the right amount of stupid then.”\n\nHe managed to laugh. “Thank god. I thought I was the wrong amount.”\n\nI held tighter and gave his ear a kiss. \n\nWe lay still for a time. I closed my eyes and tried to pretend I was just laying on my dorm bed. That I would wake up and see the university outside my window.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBecause Prof. Ed was feeling morose, I took over the iPad duties. \n\nI sent a full report to Groups B and C, detailing the account with the Indreks, and Clayton's death.\n\nI included my own amateur drawing of the [double-Indrek](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Sj7OibI), so they could actually grasp what we were dealing with. We all decided to be very careful when writing the next answer to Indrek’s equation.\n\nThe chat bounced ideas back and forth, but no one would write anything until everyone felt *very* convinced by a proposed new solution. \n\nThey even started to swap little mini academic theses about how the physics in this mall world worked. It would have been cute if it wasn't so dire.\n\nOur full team of survivors was on high alert now. Everyone was told to stock up.\n\nAlthough we left Clayton lying on that bed with his own backpack of supplies, the one thing we did bring with us was his revolver. \n\nA six barrel Smith and Wesson.

I'm new in this community so I apologize for any mistake I could make sharing this matter that is happening right now.\n\nPd. I'm not a native English speaker so sorry for any inconveniences reading this.\n\nI'll start, since June 2024 I moved into my own house, I'm a 29yo male that does a blue collar job. Here were I live salaries are... Shiete. So I got an opportunity to get a very cheap house near a factory complex, I literally doesn't have neighbors because in front of my house there's a large depot that belongs to these factories.\n\nSince let's say, late January or early February I'll be getting some random hits at my front door at night, it's always one knock, sometimes it's two but not more. My dog becomes berserk and when I get up to see anything on my front window I see nothing.\n\nSo, as I'm writing this, it's just happened again, it's not every night and is not in the exact moment. I don't know what to do because if I get ready to confront this guy I have to be awaken all night, all nights. And I have to work early in the morning so it's frustrating. \n\nI have a weapon, my dog, and my little house is full protected with barrels and locks. Nobody can get inside, even less from the front door, it's literally zombie proofed.\n\nAt the very front of my door that goes to the street there's a little field with a couple of trees. One of them loses all it's leafs so you can hear the bastard when he goes away running. \n\nIf I hunt him down it could be a disaster, and here police doesn't break a sweat for anything that's not \"really gruesome\".\n\nI will try to put cameras outside, maybe at least this will show me how the f**ker looks like. But believe me, Im currently living in Latin America and we barricade our homes to the extreme because it's very hum.... Horrid outside at night some places have literally no law and it feels like The Purge, if you don't believe me you can see it in YouTube\n.... so there's no chance this guy will break into my house, and if he does, hell will let lose. \n\nAt some point I believed this was a joke from a worker wandering the street on his way home,\n\nBut it's still happening after almost three months. \n\n\n\n\nPd: they removed my first try to post.... Uh .. this post because I could get it to five hundred words but I can't add more information because it will be just something that I invented, I can't give you guys more information and it could be that bastard maybe is a redditor reading this and laughing his ass off.\n\nSo here's a little story on my trip to Murica. \nI was in the US one time, and I love it. My wish is to go back again and drive a HD to Daytona Bike Week to meet with my NC (North Carolina) based girl. I meet her in a bikini bike wash from a HD franchise in there, Gator Harley Davidson. Blonde, tall, skinny with a southern way of speak, parents were from WV, and was always extremely cherish, funny and overall happy (for anyone wondering she had a two part black bikini like the rest of the girls). She washed my bike, tell her I love her ( I drank couple beers), she said to go back again and say hi with my rented bike (lol) and at the fourth day I got a date with her to a local restaurant. \n\nSince that day I was in constant contact with her and I hope in the nearly future I got to see her again. Loved it there, but Daytona in Bike Week was expensive as hell mate "},"96":{"title":"Has anybody heard of this strange book?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdiisz\/has_anybody_heard_of_this_strange_book\/","flair":null,"author":"Bee_LZ_Bub","selftext":"My travels through my life had left me lost. \/ My masters in Poetry left me broke. \/ Unable to find any will to write, \/ I felt as if I was not but a ghost.\n\nI was told \"You Need some inspiration\" \/ \"Go and read a new book for some ideas.\" \/ I figured there was no harm in trying. \/ Plus I'd been inside for what felt like years.\n\nThe blinding sun bore down like a tyrant. \/ My blue-light damaged eyes could barely stand. \/ Over 20 hours in a word doc, \/ Was enough to break the strongest of man.\n\nWith income that was in the negative, \/ I did not have much change to throw around. \/ Knowing I could not buy anything new, \/ I had a place in mind that was downtown.\n\nThe used book store near me has tons of deals. \/ Searching through I found this book of poems, \/ Deep in the bottom of the clearance bin. \/ The title read, \"The Whispers of the Thames\"\n\nThe name on front read William Shakespeare. \/ I'd never heard his name on such a work. \/ The yellow cover aged and bleached by sun, \/ Pages edged by gold now covered in dirt.\n\nI'd ne'er seen a book in quite ill a shape, \/ Though many that they sold could be quite worn. \/ Carefully I flipped to a random page \/ And from that moment my eyes shan't be torn.\n\nI fingered through, my hands ravin'd, enticed, \/ Soaking in text as air deep in my lungs. \/ My eyes entranced I barely risked a breath. \/ For on e'ery syllable my heart hung.\n\nThe story spoke of secrets lost to time. \/ A river giving truths to those who pray. \/ A playwright who knew he could not resist, \/ The story of a long forbidden play. \n\nThis man wrote down the secrets now revealed. \/ He wrote it down in ink til it ran dry. \/ His feathered pen ran red, his body torn, \/ Swearing that he would finish or he'd die. \n\nThe man who's mind was weak unlike my own. \/ He spoke of hunger unable to sate. \/ He read the play for days and days on end, \/ Until all the was left was book and bone.\n\nBeyond my weary eyes the sun went down. \/ Entranced, I'd not marked that an hour'd passed. \/ Engrossed in stories, kings and masquerade, \/ Their sunset twice as bright beyond the vast.\n\nA man's voice shouted over crashing waves. \/  He spoke as if I deaf or slow to learn. \/ As though I was a bother in his way, \/ His words lacked much, drones of unpregnant scorn.\n\n\"Come on man, we're ten minutes passed our close. \/ Do you think that you can, like, get out now? \/ All my guys left, told me to lock up when \/ I could get you to put that damn book down.\"\n\nWith Iv'ry fists I clenched my treasured tome. \/ What felt like hours, unable to speak. \/ My thoughts unworthy til embraced in gold, \/ I finally let out a cracking squeak.\n\n\"I shan't abandon this pure work of art. \/ I'd rather be found in Hell's deepest ring. \/ For I know that there is no greater pain. \/ Than that of separation from my king.\"\n\nI'd been unable to conjure more words. \/ At least none that I knew would be approved. \/ The thought of speaking out of line absurd. \/ I'd rather silence than let filth consume. \n\nThe man reached down and pulled out his device, \/ He tapped three numbers, then begun the ring. \/ A whisper from the Thames engulfed my mind. \/ \"You best not let him disobey your king.\"\n\nAs though my body was not of my own, \/ I felt my legs alight with grace and poise. \/ For I knew not what horrors were in store, \/ If I were not to stop that horrid noise. \n\nTo vanquish those who would stand in his way, \/ I heard his honeyed voice like rays of sun. \/ My arms outstretched I lept onto my prey, \/ And held him down, windpipe under my thumb.\n\nHis heartbeat thumped in synchrony with mine. \/ His screams drowned out by ringing in my ears. \/ As if the lord himself agreed with me, \/ I saw his yellow robes within his tears. \n\nI laughed as I felt him limp under me, \/ His face a simular of storied masks. \/ Letting go, my mind finally at ease, \/ Searching for the book became my next task. \n\nPapers strewn from where my fists had unclenched. \/ Seams that due to time had come unraveled. \/ Pages cracked to dust as I grabbed for them. \/ For I knew not where my king had traveled. \n\nFinal words I'd read had left me searching. \/ Looking for his gilded crown and shawl. \/ My brain rings with the King's shames and cursings, \/ That I have not fulfilled his final call.\n\nPlease, if you are out there and you're reading, \/ If you know any place to find this story, \/ Deliver me from my pains of pleading, \/ Help me bring my king to his full glory.

I mean it is a national holiday and everyone is out in less depressing parts of the city or at home. I of course am at work, as always.\n\nSitting at the desk with my laptop and power-saving mode on – writing this. Once the battery goes out I'll probably tinker with the radio. The thing has been stuck on one damn station for the entire duration that I've worked here. And its always the same rock, blues and occasional folk song over and over again with the host commenting on the local politics sometimes.\n\nI really need something new to listen to...\n\nBut since there are no customers yet, I'll write a couple more things about the regulars.\n\nWell... Last time I *did* mention the *hallway*. I should elaborate more on it before I go on my tangent.\n\nAs of writing the hallway has become a staple feature of the kiosk. There are no lights in there, so I have to have a flashlight with me whenever I go in there.\n\nI never go far in. I find the shelf that has what I need and I come back, which is usually a couple steps in. And what I need is either vodka, beer or tobacco... Which is conveniently most of the damn hallway from what I can see.\n\nI do hear shuffling when inside that place, too. Ever since the hallway appeared the little bastards aren't as active as before. I think they have all the vodka they need in the hallway. Though it still does happen that a vodka bottle drops down and breaks here and there... At least Winston doesn't cut my pay because of it... We do have an infinite supply of the stuff now anyway.\n\nOh, yeah. The shelves restock themselves in the hallway. Don't ask how or why. They just do. *Awfully* convenient.\n\nThe flashlight doesn't go that far inside, I can maybe see 10-ish meters inside, before it becomes pitch black. Though when I whistle inside there is an echo that lasts... *Uncomfortably long.*\n\nThe roosters though, they became a bit more active in the last few weeks I noticed. They would bang on the door more frequently. I mean the door is made out of metal, and is quite secure. There is one small detail I forgot to mention the last time. The door does have a few... Bumps that seem to have been made by someone – or *something* – from the outside.\n\nIf Winston didn't mention it, I guess it's fine. Could've been the roosters or something.\n\nThe whole place is pretty secure to be honest. I just hate that I have no real windows in here, only the little window that fits money, teeth, cigarettes and at most eight bottles of vodka through it – horizontally, top first. The rest of the windows are covered by newspapers, and Winston told me not to touch them.\n\nI do find it annoying. But it does help with the anxiety when I hear the banging from the outside, or some other weird sounds sometimes. All I need to see are the customers.\n\nMiss Six tends to try and squint through the newspapers I noticed. She'd knock and I would feel something *stare* at me. I think I once saw one of her eyes through a small slit in the newspapers. Just looking at me.\n\nI forgive her creepiness. It could be that she is impatient to get her sixes – vampiric moonshine – or some shit.\n\n...\n\nShe did offer me that hug? Or did she? Maybe I hallucinated, who knows. I'll ask her later if she comes around... Did I talk to her before? Like *actually* talk?\n\nAgh, there's a first time for everything. Not like women scare me.\n\nI mean I was once greeted by one big eye when I opened that window, it covered the whole view. I couldn’t see anything beyond it. Just one big, yellowish eye – staring at me.\n\nI didn’t piss myself at all. I probably did shit myself a bit. But that was probably due to the kebab I bought before that shift.\n\nAnd before you ask – “Why didn’t you go to the toilet?” – I already told you, I refuse to touch that toilet.\n\nI can probably get some balls and venture further into the hall and make an improvised toilet in there… If Winston asks, I’ll blame the gnomes. Fuck them.\n\nHuh, this journaling shit does help my thinking.\n\nWell, I think there’s a customer. I’ll write a bit later.\n\n\\###\n\nI had a weird thing happen. Someone knocked like ten minutes ago, I opened up and did my greetings. Just to realize no one was there.\n\nThen again a few minutes later, the same thing. Out of all the shit I’ve seen, the most mundane knock and fuck off prank is *weird* to me.\n\nI’ll try to see who it is.\n\n\\### \n\n1^(st) May, 23:53hrs\n\nI think I should put the time and date when I write.\n\nI use “military time”. So if any of you Americans think that’s wrong. I am European. Fuck you.\n\n\\### \n\n1^(st) May, 23:58hrs\n\nI forgot what I wanted to write. I apologize to the Americans, I was joking.\n\nAnyway, Miss Six came around today, a little while ago – She was in a good mood as always, very polite, a bit flirty. And I decided to ask her something. Not her name, but how someone was knocking then bugging off by the time I opened.\n\nWeirdly she got a bit more serious after that.\n\n“Ah, *they* like to do that. Don’t worry about that darling, you can always go out and chase them off. I think a strong man is hiding behind that glass.” – She said, with a wink.\n\nWho is that *they,* I have no idea and why she is constantly trying to get me to go out, I dunno. I only know that I have less of bottle number six and more teeth in the drawers.\n\n\\###\n\n2^(nd) May, 00:22\n\nI think Miss Six is trying to ask me out. I mean, “Go out and chase them off” – Could that be some sort of hint? Or am I overthinking it? I think this journaling shit is really helping my thoughts but I am thinking a bit too much for my taste. I don’t want to spiral again.\n\nThe last drunk of the evening got his daily evening dose of vodka and tobacco so I’ll be free for some time again, I think. Glad that I don’t have to clean the outside, I think he threw up right in front of the kiosk the moment I closed the window.\n\nAnyway, I also wanted to talk more about the shit I saw.\n\nThere was this drunk once, not Smirnoff, but a dude that was his age. They seemed similar, like they came from the same dump – or swam in stale milk, because he smelled like a combination of a mold, shit, alcohol and milk… With a hint of lavender.\n\nBut he didn’t smell like that always, the first few months I worked here he just smelled like moldy shit and alcohol – and acted like your typical drunk. But I remember one night, he was buying the usual when he told me how – through slurred speech – “Tonight is a wee bit colder, innit brah?”\n\nI agreed. Despite not really noticing it. He was a bit more anxious for some reason. Like the cops are on to him or something.\n\nHe had a gray beanie on his head. It looked like it had seen better days, but it had this specific tear on one side of it. Not deep, but it looked like it had been cut by a knife or something.\n\nSee, later that night I heard the usual banging and knocking. But there was a really strong BANG in the front of the kiosk – like something went full speed into it. Enough to make me jump from my seat.\n\nI stood frozen for a few moments, before I decided to go and open of the window to see what’s up. I saw nothing. Then went back to watch Family Guy on my laptop.\n\nThough when my shift ended I took a better look at the front of the kiosk in the morning. And I saw some red… It looks distinct on the snow, mixed with bile, mud and God knows what else.\n\nAnd on top of the snow was the gray beanie, with that cut on one side.\n\nI didn’t touch it, I just looked, and left. I figured the dude probably wanted to get another vodka but was so drunk that he fell, knocked himself out on the kiosk, and I couldn’t see him on the ground when I opened the window.\n\nI mean if he wasn’t there he got up at some point, so he was alive.\n\nAnd I did see him the next evening, but he was… Off.\n\nHe bought the usual. But he didn’t talk much, or at all. He’d just come to the kiosk, knock, have the exact amount for a vodka and ciggies in his hand – and he’d just stare.\n\nAfter a few weeks he was gone completely. The beanie was gone too.\n\n\\### \n\n2^(nd) May, 1:02\n\nNo customers, don’t know what to watch. I could maybe get a subscription service for shows and movies… Maybe? I mean, yeah I can afford it.\n\nYeah, I can.\n\nI did get that USB with a bunch of newer movies from my cousin… I left it at home though.\n\n\\### \n\n2^(nd) May, 1:20\n\nI had a customer who was new. I think he’s a bloodsucker. I mean, I know. He wanted number 11. But he also wanted cigarettes and a couple of strawberry juices… I had to go to the hallway to get some, because Winston didn’t restock the juices since last month, only kids buy them. Not a lot of kids around here… Kids that don’t drink alcohol, that is.\n\nHe was like most of them. But he did seem to kind of stare at me more than usual. For some reason. \n\n2^(nd) May, 2:13\n\nI found something to watch, but my battery is low for fuck sake. I should save it.\n\nI could ask Winston why for the love of God and all that is holy this kiosk doesn’t have one extra power thingy, whatever you call it in English. Plug?\n\nI’ll tell him that my job satisfaction will go through the roof if he does that. Or just somehow lets me able to charge my laptop and phone. \n\n2^(nd) May, 2:44\n\nAbout 3 hours and 20 minutes left. No customers in the last hour. I’ve been listening to the radio a bit. I tried to switch the station but to no avail.\n\nThe radio is on one of the shelves, an old piece of shit. I think its one of those crystal radios, it looks like it was working non-stop since the coronation of Franz Ferdinand… Wait, he was killed, yeah. Joseph? Yeah, Joseph Ferdinand. I think.\n\nAnyway, I decided to unplug it. Weirdly it worked even when not plugged in… That’s when I realized that I have a free plug! But okay, it might have a battery. Weird thing is it started being a bit distorted closer to the desk.\n\nI walked in circles a bit to see where the source of that disruption was, and I think its coming from the hallway.\n\nI took like two steps inside with the radio and confirmed that it was indeed the hallway.\n\nWell, I am not surprised… Hmm, I might catch some otherworldly radio station? Maybe Smirnoff will be the commentator, the gnomes the audience.\n\n“All About Vodka FM” – It would be called.\n\nMy laptop is now charging, the radio is still playing some annoying blues. It at least fills the dullness of the space. \n\n\\###\n\n2^(nd) May, 3:00\n\nThe banging stopped.\n\nI mean the constant banging that slowly intensifies until around 4:30, it stopped abruptly.\n\nI can just hear the radio now.\n\nWeird.\n\nI am trying to remember if it happened before? I’ll ask Winston about it.\n\n\\### \n\n2^(nd) May, 3:10\n\nI’m sitting here in front of the hallway. Just watching. For some reason curiosity is beginning to creep in.\n\nWhat’s beyond all of that? Are the shelves infinite? Why do they restock?\n\nAre the little vodka thiefs to blame for it? Is it the portal to their realm? Or just a colony?\n\nAnd I think I noticed the shelves are in a *slightly* different arrangement every single time. Like when I go inside – let’s say three times per shift – I notice that the vodka shelf is maybe one step farther or one step closer… Nothing you’d really notice the first few times. But with me working virtually every single damn evening for the past few months. You start to notice things. Even if they might subconcious…\n\nOr I might imagining things. It can always be that.\n\nOh, I have customer. I’ll write later.\n\n \\### \n\n2^(nd) May, 6:32\n\nI think that I will fucking kill her.\n\nI said women don’t scare me. But one woman I really, *really* did not want to see. The one whose presence made my stomach drop – the one waiting for me behind that creaky, shitty window…\n\nMy sister.\n\nI first thought I was hallucinating. But no it was really her.\n\nAfter confirming that was really her – By asking a very specific thing about me – then I told her bluntly – “What the fuck are you doing here at this hour?!”\n\nI swear to God no fucking energy drink or coffee can wake a man up as fast as this. Fucking hell.\n\n“I need some help.” – She said.\n\nAnd of course I was scared to hear what it was.\n\nIt ended up being that her friend lives around here and she was sleeping over after a study session. And she needed somewhere to sleep until the buses start driving again around 4 or 4:30.\n\nFirstly, *bullshit.* I know she is a top student and all, but she is a *teenage girl,* and I wouldn’t be surprised if her *friend* was of the opposite gender\\*.\\* Secondly, I was inclined to scold her then and there.\n\nBut then I heard some knocks at the back of the kiosk.\n\nThen – what if it wasn’t really *her.*\n\nI heard the knocks go up the kiosk, tapping their way up.\n\nWhat if I let her in and she end up being a rooster… And bloodsucker… Or, who knows what? A shapeshifter?\n\n*She’ll see the damn hallway.*\n\nI heard as the taps reached the roof.\n\n“Dude why are you staring at me?” – She asked. – “It smells like shit out here!”\n\nI heard the taps get closer.\n\n“Get in. Now.” I said.\n\n“Where’s the door on this thing?” She asked back.\n\nI got up from my seat and was going to the metal door.\n\nThen I heard her.\n\nI heard her scream.\n\nI bolted, I turned the key in the metal door.\n\n  I flung it open and sprinted out. For the first time.\n\nMy heart was beating like cannons.\n\nI turned the corner. I was ready to kill.\n\nTo die…\n\nBut she… She was fine.\n\nShe laughed.\n\nAnd she was not alone.\n\n“Good morning darling! You have a wonderful sister, I must say! My, and he’s a handsome one isn’t he Natalia?”\n\nI stood there, confused. I didn’t know what to say.\n\n“Bro, since when did you get a girlfriend? Why didn’t you tell me!”\n\n“W-what?”\n\n“Dude, Kristi, here.” She pointed at the gorgeous redhead.\n\n“Natali, dear, don’t make him uncomfortable.” She said to my sister – “Look, darling, I brought you something.” She put forth her hand, holding a plastic bag. I just stared at it.\n\n“I’ll… I’ll pas-“ – Before I could finish my sentence my sister cut me off – “He’ll take it, thank you!”\n\nShe grabbed the plastic bag. Then gave a the stink eye for a second.\n\n“Thank you Kristi so much, you’re a very good teacher! And please do take care of my brother, he’s a thickheaded idiot as I told you.” My sister said.\n\nI don’t remember much of the girl talk. I was stuck frozen in fight or flight mode for I don’t know how much.\n\nI was jolted out by what *Miss Six* said.\n\n“Oh, dear. Leave the man be, I’ll drive you home. It’s no problem. I am a night owl, and I do enjoy a night drive!”\n\nI was about to say something.\n\nBut I somehow felt… She was not a threat.\n\n“Can I drive her back home, or do you want her to be with you?” She asked – *like she read my mind.*\n\nMy sister naturally protested how I don’t order her around.\n\n“Sure… Yeah, go ahead. Drive safe.” I turned to my sister – “You and I have to talk tomorrow.”\n\nI am writing this from home. I am tired.\n\nI returned back to the kiosk after that. I just sat down in thought. I didn’t know what to do. I felt dreadful yet somehow… Safe.\n\nWas it a rooster? I asked my sis after coming back home why she screamed when I was heading out, she said *Kristiana* just appeared out of nowhere. And that *she was at her place.*\n\nShe – Miss Six – Is my sister’s tutor.\n\nAnd apparently I am her boyfriend. Or maybe that a joke between the two. I don’t fucking know.\n\nI just can’t shake the feeling that if she didn’t appear that the scream I would’ve heard from my sister wouldn’t have been from being startled but out of pain.\n\nThat tapping.\n\nThat was a rooster. No doubt about it.\n\nI can’t think. I’ll post this now and just go to sleep. I’ll update you how it goes.\n\nGood night.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},"98":{"title":"Bumps and Deadbolts","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kdchd4\/bumps_and_deadbolts\/","flair":null,"author":"NatureAccording1976","selftext":"Fair warning I am not much of a writer.... hell I ain't even much of a reader. But this is what happened.\n\n\n\nI live in a small town bordering the woods, and like most small towns, it's boring as hell. Almost nothing ever happens here, but when something does, almost everyone knows—well, most of the time, anyway.\n\nI'm sure anyone else who lives in a community like mine can relate. It's generally filled with a few people who actively get things done and others who seem to exist solely to waste your time.\n\nMostly, it's harmless—old ladies gossiping. Like, yes Bertha, we all know June and Dave are getting divorced. And old men telling tall tales. No, Jim, you didn't see a forty-pointer three springs ago.\n\nNo one recalls the most annoying man who ever lived here—or at least, they don’t want to.\n\nI never claimed my time was all that valuable, but I still did my best to avoid getting caught up in all of it. Still, even I occasionally got roped into the latest town gossip or a well-spun yarn. But even the chattiest of Kathys avoided Frank.\n\nFrank was pleasant enough, aside from his droning voice and his uncanny ability to never talk about anything that ended with a point—or anything resembling reason. Conversations with him were a slow descent into endless nothingness.\n\nOnce, he spent over an hour explaining the best way to make French toast, breaking down the process as if it were a life-altering discovery. By the time he was finished, the only thing he’d actually accomplished was making everyone wish they’d never eat French toast again.\n\nFrank was the epitome of normal. Like everyone in town, we thought we knew everything about him—not just his love of French toast. He lived alone at the edge of the woods, worked at the tire shop every day except Sunday, and never seemed to break from his routine.\n\nSo when he was found dead in his bed, it came as a shock.\n\nThe rumor mill went into full effect, but according to the coroner, Dave, it was anaphylaxis.\n\n\"It's the most bumps I've seen on anyone!\" he said a little louder than intended.\n\nThen, in a hushed whisper, \"According to his medical records, he wasn’t allergic to anything.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I spoke with the chief, and they didn’t find anything that could have caused it. He pretty much only ate TV dinners, and they didn’t find any pests or anything else that could’ve triggered the reaction. I should know a lot more when the toxicology reports come back.\"\n\nThe reports were due back the following Tuesday. I knew something was up before I even hit Main Street—I could hear the murmurs, voices carrying in hushed tones.\n\nA random woman said matter-of-factly, \"Well, at least she won’t have to keep paying the lawyer.\"\n\nOne man shook his head and proclaimed, \"It’s a damn shame.\"\n\nBy the time I reached Main Street, it was clear: Dave was dead. And no one knew how or why.\n\nI was hanging out near the barbershop when I overheard someone say he had bled out. But no cuts or slashes had been found—just the bumps.\n\nAfter Dave’s death, time just sort of passed as normal. After the initial flood of rumors, the new coroner blamed it on mosquitoes and allergy medications, and town gossip returned to its usual routine—who’s been seen with who, and deer the size of mountains.\n\nFrank was mostly forgotten entirely until a family moved into his old home. I hear their kids get teased from time to time—\"You know someone died in that house, right?\"\n\nNow, Halloween was approaching. And every town needs a boogeyman, I guess.\n\nNothing of note happened until spring. It started as a trickle—one or two people a day visiting the doctor, complaining about strange, itchy bumps. It never ramped up into something big. Maybe if it had, people would have actually paid attention.\n\nEach case was small, only three or four bumps at most. But the locations were bizarre—between the fingers, the bottom of the foot, right inside the edge of the nostril.\n\nI wasn’t one of the first to experience it. I didn’t believe it until it happened to me.\n\nOh god, the itching. The fucking itching was unbearable. If I could have taken an acid bath and stripped my skin away, I would have.\n\nThe only relief came at night when I took the dose the doctor had given me. At first, I hesitated—after everything that had happened to Dave and Frank, who wouldn’t?\n\nBut doxylamine and diphenhydramine did the trick.\n\nIt took four months for the damn bumps to finally disappear.\n\nThe following spring, the bumps came back. But not everyone got them this time. I was one of the unlucky souls affected, but blessed to only have one on the sole of my foot.\n\nOthers weren’t so lucky. They ended up with ten to twenty bumps spread out on one side of their bodies.\n\n\n\nThe first to go missing disappeared about two weeks after the bumps started reappearing around town.\n\nIt was one of the kids from Frank’s house.\n\nWe searched the woods, the town, called in volunteers from around the county—but not a trace of him.\n\nSleeping one minute, gone the next.\n\nTwo days later, he was found screaming in the tree fort behind the house. His left leg was a bloody mess, skin and flesh scraped down to the shinbone.\n\nHis fingernails—broken and missing on both hands.\n\nTo this day, the kid hasn’t spoken. He’s been in and out of mental health facilities ever since.\n\nWord around the barbershop is that, when he’s alone, he has a habit of going *bzzzzzz... bzzzzz...* Constantly.\n\nAfter that, I’m sure deadbolt sales at the hardware store shot up—but it didn’t matter.\n\nTwo days after he was found, the next person disappeared.\n\nBy then, rumors had stopped flying. No one lingered on Main Street anymore.\n\nPeople went to work or school and then went straight home.\n\nThe next poor victim was a waitress from the diner.\n\nShe was working a late shift, but something happened between the last customer leaving and when she should have locked up—because locking up never happened.\n\nShe was missing for two days before they found her, halfway to the next town.\n\nHer back was a mess. Her shirt was torn to shreds, along with the skin beneath it.\n\nIt looked like she had slid on her back, all the way from our town to the next.\n\nBut later, we found out her lower back had never touched the pavement.\n\nThe bumps were still there.\n\nShortly after her release, she left town—never to return.\n\nNo one is sure what happened while she was missing.\n\nNext was Gary from the hardware store.\n\nI guess even with all the money he made selling deadbolts, the poor son of a bitch never thought to install one himself.\n\nIt was the same pattern as before. He went missing, we searched, and two days later, he was found.\n\nThey had to take him to the city hospital for reconstructive surgery.\n\nWhen they found him, his eyelids were swollen shut. He wasn’t sure where he was, or how long he’d been locked in the backroom of the hardware store.\n\nThe poor guy had gouged his own eyes out.\n\nHe doesn’t remember much.\n\nBut he does remember the buzzing—the incessant, gnawing sound that never stopped.\n\nA while later, a hunter from a few towns over went missing.\n\nDuring the search for him, police uncovered a storm cellar in a burnt-out shack.\n\nInside, they found a bunk, a table, and a woodfire stove.\n\nAmong the collected items was Gary’s ID.\n\nAt some point during the investigation, the place somehow went up in flames.\n\nPolice reported finding syringes filled with doxylamine, diphenhydramine, and D7 proteins.\n\nThey believe it burned so fast because the rags were soaked in brake fluid.\n\nDespite everything, the hunter was not found anywhere near the shack.\n\nWhen they finally located him—far from town—he was alive.\n\nNo bumps.\n\nIt’s been years since it all happened, but today on the news I heard the state will be introducing UVL sprays to control the bugs.\n\nI also found a bump.\n\nAnd man, does it itch to the bone.\n\nYou’d think with everything that’s happened, the creep in the cellar would be the most annoying person in town—but no. That was still Frank. Fuck, Frank."},"99":{"title":"If You Meet Me, Please Kill Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kckrkf\/if_you_meet_me_please_kill_me\/","flair":null,"author":"EaPAtbp","selftext":"My friends won’t believe me, my family thinks I’m crazy, and if I keep trying to convince them, they’re probably just going to lock me up. But I need help, and I think that strangers online are my last hope. So I’m begging: if you meet me, if you see me walking down the street and I say hello, if you meet me in a bar and feel inclined to buy me a drink, or if you match with me on a dating app and make plans, kill me. End it. I don’t care how it’s done. I’d prefer it to be as painful as possible, but I know that’s probably a lot to ask. It’s already a lot to ask someone who doesn’t know me to commit murder on my behalf, and I’m sorry to put such a burden on you, but I truly can’t do this any longer. \n\nLet me provide you with some context. I might have gotten ahead of myself, but I came on too strong. Don’t leave yet, please. At least let me explain to you what’s been going on. Maybe--- hopefully--- once you hear this, you’ll be on my side. Maybe you’ll believe me. Hell, maybe you’ve experienced this too. I can’t be the only one who has experienced this.\n\nIt started two months ago at Mich’s. Mich’s is a small bar that my friends and I used to go to every Friday night. They had a karaoke night, and everyone got free nachos with the purchase of a drink. It was a routine we had been sticking to for almost a year now, ever since Melly moved into the apartment complex down the street and found the place. \n\nAnyway, it was a Friday night, probably around 10 PM, because I remember that Jonas had just arrived and he got off his shift at the hospital at 9:00 on those days. Melly and I had just performed a tipsy version of Fleetwood Mac’s *Rhiannon*, and we were giggling and stumbling back to our booth when he intercepted our path. \n\nHe said his name was Tony, short for Antonio. He said he was new in the city and had just moved here from Idaho or Iowa, I don’t really remember. He wanted to talk to me, he said I had a nice voice, and he enjoyed my performance, and he would like to get to know me a bit better. I agreed, because he was my type: dark hair, green eyes, stubble on his jawline. He smelled like Tide laundry detergent and something else that reminded me of my childhood friend Isdra’s house. It felt familiar to me, and so I followed him to a booth near my friends, and we talked for the entire night. \n\nOur first date was dinner and a movie, a classic first date. We watched *Hearteyes*, which he loved, but I said wasn’t my style. We went to this expensive French restaurant after. A small place that was almost an hour away, and we had wine and ate our dinner while a woman sat in the corner of the room and sang *La Vie En Rose.* It was romantic, he was romantic, it was a great date. \n\nThe first bad sign didn’t feel like a bad sign when it happened. You know what they say about hindsight. It started with him going by his full name instead of Tony. He said he had always gone by Tony because he preferred it; he thought Antonio was a mouthful, that Tony made him sound like a fun, easy-going guy while Antonio made him sound like the opposite. And then, that day, he changed his mind.\n\n“You’ve never gone by Ella or Stell?” He asked me one evening as we were walking through a small street fair that the city put on every year. \n\n“Mmmm, nope. Just Stella. I’ve always been completely Stella.” I replied as I took a sip of my soda.\n\n“Really? You’ve never gone by a nickname? Not even as a child?” \n\nI shook my head no again. \n\nI remember this conversation vividly now. I had forgotten about it soon after it happened because it seemed irrelevant at the time, but as soon as I realized what was going on, it popped back into my mind like someone had dug into my subconscious and pulled it out, projecting it onto a big screen right in my face. \n\nAfter that, he decided he wanted to be Antonio. He wanted to be completely Antonio. \n\nAfter that step was done, the rest came quicker and quicker, like an avalanche headed downhill until it spiraled out of control. \n\nHe changed his hair, dyed it a lighter brown, like mine. His eyes, which I swear to all of the Gods were green when I met him, were now dark brown, like mine. He got slimmer, losing his broad shoulders, almost overnight. His face got rounder, softer, and less angular. He shrank three inches. \n\nThen he took my jokes, stole my bits, and started saying things that only I would say. Even my friends would comment on it, albeit in an innocent way.\n\n“Oh my God, that’s such a Stella thing to say!”\n\n“Aww, that’s so cute, you guys are becoming like the same person!”\n\n“Ugh, I love when couples start to adapt each other’s mannerisms!”\n\nExcept we weren’t doing that. HE was stealing all of MY jokes. He was taking all of my catch phrases, he would use my references that he didn’t even know previously. He stole my style, swapping out his Vans, jeans, and button-up shirts for thrifted boots and band tees. He got glasses even though he didn’t need them, and he went vegetarian. \n\nThe worst part about this, the part that pissed me off the most as this was taking place, was the fact that everyone--- EVERYONE--- acted like I was insane. They acted like he had always been like that. \n\n*He never went by Tony, Stella, what are you talking about? His eyes were never green, I think you’re misremembering. Maybe it was the lighting in the bar that night? He’s always been the exact same height as you, it’s impossible for someone to just shrink.* \n\nIt was such bullshit. It’s making me mad all over again to think about it now. Nobody believed me. I tried showing them photos where you could clearly see the differences, and it was like they didn’t notice them, like I was the only one who could see the photo as is. \n\nI need to calm down. I’m not finished telling you my story, and I worry about you getting bored. I need you to believe me. \n\nSo, would you believe me when I tell you that about two weeks ago, he became me?\n\nI mean, he literally became *me*. He morphed into a clone of *me*. He goes by *my* name, he wears *my* face, and hangs out with *my* friends. I almost had a heart attack when I saw it the first time. It was like I was looking in a mirror. A fucked up mirror who had taken over my life. My friends acted like nothing was wrong, like he had always looked like that. They didn’t think we looked alike at all, they didn’t think it was weird that we had the same name. Everything was just a big, fat, stupid coincidence to them. It’s so infuriating it almost makes me laugh.\n\nSo that’s where we are now. He, or I don’t know, it? It can’t be human, can it? Whatever it is has become me, and it’s ruining my life. He picks up my medications, takes my esthetician appointments, takes my pilates classes, hangs out with my family, everything. \n\nI need you to kill him. It. Me. Something needs to die. \n\nPlease. \n\nMy name is Stella Koby. I’m 5 feet 5 inches. Short brown hair, curly, collarbone length. Brown eyes, big glasses with thick red frames. I’ve got a tattoo of a skull on the inside of my right wrist, and a four-inch-long scar that runs down the back of my right arm, down my elbow. It’s from when I fell off a horse as a child. I’m 156 pounds, and I’m a big fan of rock music, specifically Blondie. I love action movies, and I’m allergic to cinnamon. \n\nYou might meet me out in public, in the produce section of your local supermarket. Maybe on Bumble, or Hinge, or Grindr. I’m in thrift stores a lot, maybe watch out for me there. You’ll know it’s not the real me because I haven’t left my apartment in over a week, and I have no plans of doing so. I want that thing gone. I want it gone from this world before I ever step foot outside again.\n\nI don’t know how it picks its victims, but it’s quite charming. Just be careful. You can try to avoid it if you want, but your best bet is to just kill it and put an end to this thing. So please, if you meet me, if you meet it as me, please kill it. \n\n"},"194":{"title":"TV static became my Hell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kda6mn\/tv_static_became_my_hell\/","flair":null,"author":"StraightStranger1134","selftext":"One night I was home and my family, which consisted of my Mom, Dad, brother, sister and me. We were watching TV. Both my parents worked multiple full time jobs, so all of us being home at the same time was a rare occasion. My brother and I had just come home from swim practice and my sister had come home from dance rehearsal. We were all tired and we just wanted to not do anything but veg out and watch some mind numbing TV. \n\nI don’t even remember what we were watching, it was probably America’s Funniest Home Videos, or Survivor. All I know is, after a while of us watching, something happened to the TV signal and it turned to Static. My dad asked if I could take a look and see if something got unplugged. I got up from the couch and took a look at the TV and it didn’t look like anything out of the ordinary had happened to it. I went back to sit down, not really paying attention to my surroundings. I said, “Well I don’t see anything wrong with it, maybe we could just play some games or call…,” that's when I saw that all members of my family were staring at me with these horrible faces. They were grinning from ear to ear, and their eyes were so wide I thought they might pop out of their sockets. Their faces made me jump, and I said, “What’s wrong? Why are you smiling like that?,”...no answer. That’s when their eyes started to trickle, a red viscous liquid oozing from their horrible eyes. Oh God, it was blood. I was frozen, I couldn’t move. I was so frozen that when I felt something fall on my face it snapped me out of my frozen stupor. Red liquid had fallen on my cheek. I looked up and saw that the ceiling was…bleeding. What the hell? The ceiling started to rain with blood and I was soon covered in it, gagging with blood. The warm thick liquid running down my throat. It was downpouring blood in our living room. I coughed and screamed at my family, “STOP SMILING AT ME! HELP ME PLEASE!,” but they just continued to stare. The TV was still static, and the static was tormenting me with its continual noise.\n\n“GOD HELP ME!,” I was coughing and gagging, that's when my family got up and crept towards me. Then all of them in unison and with these horribly deep and distorted voices said, “Nothing can help you now,” I closed my eyes and begged them to stop. I just kept begging but their ungodly voices just grew louder, “NOTHING CAN HELP YOU NOW.”\n\nI woke up with a start, I screamed, I knew I had, and I was sweating profusely. My family raced in the living room to see what was the matter. I told them I had a nightmare. My Mom sat next to me and said, “Well it's all over now, let’s settle in and watch some TV,” I didn’t want to watch TV, the dream had felt so real, but I pushed the fear away and told myself that it was nothing. We settled in and started to watch some stupid reality show about God knows what. That's when I heard that unforgettable noise emit from the TV. TV static, no signal appeared on the screen. And that's when the nightmare truly began. \n\n"},"195":{"title":"I Think Someone Was Following Me Through the Woods in Ireland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kd8asl\/i_think_someone_was_following_me_through_the\/","flair":null,"author":"CosmicOrphan2020","selftext":"Back when I was 14 years old, my family had moved from our home in England to the Republic of Ireland, where we lived for a further six years. We had first moved to the north-west of the country, but after a year of living there, we then relocated to the Irish midlands, as my dad had gotten a new job working in the city.   \n\nMy parents had bought a cottage on the outskirts of a very small village, that was a stopping point from one of the larger towns to the next. This village was so small and remote, there was basically nothing to do. But not long after moving here, and taking to exploring the surrounding area with my Border Collie, Maisie, I eventually found a large stretch of bogland containing a man-made forest. Every weekend or half-term away from school, I took to walking this area with my dog, in which I would follow along a railway line used for transporting peat. However, after months of trekking this very same bogland, I eventually stopped going there. I can’t quite recall the reason why, but maybe it was because I always felt as though I was trespassing (which I wasn’t) or because the bogland was so bumpy and uneven, I always came home with horrific blisters.  \n\nAlthough I stopped going to this bogland to walk my dog, outside one of the nearby towns where I went to school, there was a public forest. Because this forest was a twenty-minute drive away, my dad would take me and Maisie there, drop us off and then pick us up again two or three hours later. What I loved about these woods was that it was always quiet – only with the occasional family, dog-walker or jogger passing us by.  \n\nOn one particular evening, I had gone back to these woods with Maisie, where my dad would later pick us up after running some errands. Making our way along the trail, the evening had already started to dimmer. Wanting to make my way back to the car park before it got too dark, I decided to take a short cut through the forest, via one of the many narrow side-trials. Following down one of these side-trials, me and Maisie stumbled upon a small tipi-shaped hut made from logs. Loving a good game of hide and seek, I would sometimes hide inside this tipi when Maisie wasn’t looking, where she would spend the next couple of minutes circling round the hut trying to find me – not realizing she could just go inside.  \n\nWhether I played this game with Maisie that day, I’m not sure – but following down this exact same side-trail, I turn to look behind me. Staring down the entryway, I then see a man walking twenty metres behind, having just taken this side-trail... For some unknown reason, I had a strange instant feeling about this man, even though I had only just noticed him. I can’t remember or even describe the way this man was walking, but the way he did so felt suspicious to me. Listening to my instincts, or perhaps just my paranoia, I quickly latch my lead back onto Maisie and hurriedly make my way down the trail.  \n\nA few minutes later, although I had reached back onto the main trail, the evening had already turned much darker. Again turning to see if the man was behind me, I could still see him around the curve, only ten metres away from me now. I did try to tell myself I was just being paranoid, and this man was most likely not following me - but my gut instinct still told me something was off.  \n\nThinking ahead, I pull out my phone to call my dad, as to make sure he was already in the car park waiting for me – but there was no answer. Because there was no answer, I just assumed he was probably still driving – and because he was still driving, I just hoped my dad was nearly on his way.  \n\nBy the time I make it back to the car park, it was basically pitch black by now, and there was just one single car in the parking area... but it wasn’t my dad’s. Sitting down by a picnic bench to wait for him to come and get us, all I could do was hope he would be coming soon and that this strange man from the woods was not following me after all.  \n\nOnly a minute or two later, I could hear the footsteps of this very same man approaching through the darkness. Anxiously anticipating him pass by, I try to distract myself on my phone – or at least make myself seem less approachable. Thankfully enough, the man just walks completely by me. Entering the car park, the man then gets in his vehicle - the only car in the car park... but he doesn’t drive away... He just stays there, sat inside his car with both the engine and headlights turned on...  \n\nTwenty minutes must have gone by, but my dad still wasn’t here – and yet this very same stranger was... Trying to call and text my dad to say I was waiting for him, I was met with no answer. While I continued waiting, I tried to rationalize why this man hadn’t decided to drive off. Whatever reasons I came up with, they were not very convincing for me - and for those whole twenty, or however many more minutes, I sat outside those woods in complete darkness, hearing nothing but the hum of this stranger’s engine among the silent night air. \n\nWhat made this situation even more anxiety-inducing, was that my dog Maisie had been endlessly whining by my feet – scraping dirt away beneath the bench to make a surprisingly deep hole. Maisie was in general a very nervous dog and basically whined at everything – but perhaps she too felt as though something about this situation wasn’t right. \n\nThankfully, after what felt far longer than twenty-so minutes, the strange man, already with his engine and headlights on, reverses from his parking spot, exits out of the car park and onto the main road – leaving me and Maisie in peace. Although we were now alone, basically stranded outside of a dark forest, I couldn’t help but feel a huge sigh of relief come over me.  \n\nMy dad did eventually come and get us – ten minutes after the man had finally decided to drive off... Do you want to know what my dad’s excuse was as to why he was so late?... He forgot he had to pick us up. \n\nI don’t know if that man really was following me through the forest, and I definitely don’t know why he just sat in his car for twenty minutes... But if I had to learn anything from that experience, it would be the following... One: my dad can sometimes be a careless douche... and Two:  \n\nNever hike through the forest alone, late in the evening. "},"197":{"title":"Does anyone remember www.deadlinks.com?

Ryan and I dragged the heavy desk into position, tipping it on its side and propping it against the wall near the door. We waited. We sat, jittery, watching the door like it might breathe. Ryan tried to lighten the mood with some dumb inside joke from way back—and we laughed. Not because it was funny. Because it felt good. Almost normal. It was the last bit of calm before the storm.\n\nI opened my mouth to ask him something—Did anything weird happen to you after DeadLinks?—but the words never made it out.\n\nThe sound of frantic footsteps in the distance caused me to shoot up to my feet and rush to the doorway. I peered out, eyes darting up and down the hallway—I saw him. Derek, full sprint, rounding the corner.\n\nAnd the antlered beast was right behind him.\n\n“Derek!” I shouted, waving him in. He ran harder, his face pale and twisted in terror. “Come on, come on, come on—” I whispered. He was almost here. Just a few more steps—\n\nI reached out—but it was already too late.\n\nThe creature grabbed Derek by the leg and yanked him backwards. With just one effortless swing he became a blur.\n\n*BANG*\n\nThe sound of a horrific wet explosion sent chills throughout my whole being. It wasn’t just an impact. It was everything breaking at once. The wet, sickening crunch of flesh and bone folding in on itself. \n\nDerek had become a fresh coat of paint on the wall.\n\nI slumped to the floor. My stomach twisted violently. My eyes darted, frantically searching for him—there had to be something left—\n\nThe only piece of him still whole was his left leg, that the monster was playing with like some kind of sick joke. Only a single piece of Derek, when just seconds ago, he had been right in front of me. \n\nAlive. \n\nI couldn’t move. My body refused to function. My brain kept rejecting what my eyes were seeing, refusing to believe it. This wasn’t real. This couldn’t be real. Tears streamed down my face. My chest convulsed, sucking in jagged, useless breaths. My vision blurred—I was frozen. \n\nSuddenly, I was pulled backwards. \n\nThe antlered beast flew past me. Ryan had grabbed me and pulled into the room just before I was about to be hit. He crouched down beside me, clamping a reassuring hand on my shoulder. His own face was streaked with tears, but his eyes were unwavering. Full of pain, but full of purpose. His voice came out rough, barely above a whisper. “I understand how you feel. But don’t throw your life away after Derek just used his to save ours.”\n\n“You’re right,” I whispered back, my voice hollow.\n\nWe didn’t even have time to register what happened to Derek. The moment we stood up, Ryan was pulled backwards as one of the cloaked creatures grabbed his leash and started dragging him toward the door. “Ryan!” I shouted. He tossed the tranq dart to me just before disappearing into the hallway. I lunged to chase after him—\n\nBut I was stopped when I heard a sharp exhale.\n\nThe antlered creature stood in the doorway. For a split second, I thought—maybe I can trap it under the desk we’d propped up earlier—\n\nThe desk came flying at me like it had been fired from a cannon. I dove aside just in time, the heavy table crashing into the cabinets behind me with a deafening explosion of splinters and metal. “How the hell did we ever think we could beat this thing?!”\n\nI had to get out—now.\n\nThe creature advanced, slow but deliberate, each step heavy. I clenched the tranq dart in my fist and made a break for it, heart pounding, trying to slip past the towering figure and out the door before it could stop me.\n\nI was too slow.\n\nThe creature saw right through me. Its massive clawed hand snatched my arm, gripping with such force that I felt my bone fracture. Agonizing pain ripped through me as my fingers spasmed, and the dart slipped from my grasp. I barely had time to register its loss before the horrifying creature yanked me up, my legs dangling uselessly in the air.\n\nI was face-to-face with it now.\n\nIts hollow, gaping eye sockets ignited with a blinding green glow. Strings of thick, glistening saliva stretched between its jagged teeth as its jaw began to unhinge—wider, and wider. The sickening crunch of snapping bones filled the air as it forced its maw past its natural limit. The gaping abyss of its throat loomed before me, and I could feel its scorching breath on my skin. The stench that drifted from its mouth was sickening—a sweetness warped by decay, both inviting and revolting all at once.\n\nMemories started flooding my mind, each one flying by like pages in a flip book. \n\nThe moment its teeth began to descend, I was knocked from its grip. I hit the ground hard, pain jolting through my body. Dazed, I looked up to see a ghoulish figure—skin stretched tight over its bones, sunken black eyes gleaming—sink its teeth into the beast’s side, tearing away a hunk of flesh.\n\nThe thing shrieked.\n\nThey collapsed into a writhing mass of claws and limbs, their monstrous forms tangled in a feral struggle. Dismembered arms slapped against the wall, twitching like they were still searching for something to grab, while new ones sprouted in their place. The antlered beast’s wounds sealed almost instantly, but the smaller creature relentlessly bit and clawed, keeping it distracted.\n\n\"This will probably be my best chance.\" I thought.\n\nI scrambled across the floor, my hands desperately searching in the darkness. My breath came in ragged, panicked gasps. Come on, come on… My fingers brushed against something cold and metallic.\n\nI seized the dart.\n\nSlowly, carefully, I stood, my eyes never leaving the two monsters as they savagely ripped into one another. I crept forward, stopping just a few feet from them, searching for an opening. \n\nNone. \n\nI needed a better distraction. As my mind raced for a solution, I absently reached for my neck—I felt my eyes widen.\n\nThe collar.\n\nI pressed my fingers against the jagged metal edge. The needles drove into my flesh instantly, sharp agony searing through my fingertips. My vision blurred with pain, but I didn’t move. I need blood. Forcing myself to endure the agony, I held my fingers there, counting the seconds in my head. With a sharp inhale, I yanked my hand away, gathering as much blood as I could under my thumb.\n\nI flicked it.\n\nTwo crimson droplets arced through the air and landed with a soft plop. Both creatures stopped. Their heads snapped toward the sound, their bodies tensing. I shoved my bleeding fingers into my mouth, stifling the scent. The moment they turned away, I moved.\n\nIn one swift motion, I drove the dart deep into the still healing chunk on the creature’s side.\n\nIt screamed.\n\nIts body convulsed violently, thrashing with such force that both the ghoul and I were flung across the room. I crashed to the floor, pain exploding through my ribs—I felt something break. My vision blurred, my ears ringing. Through my haze of agony, for a split second, it looked small. A lost, broken thing, throwing a tantrum in a world it didn’t understand.\n\nIts glowing eyes flickered. Its frantic, spasming movements slowed and dulled, then—\n\nIt stopped.\n\nAs the paralysis took hold, a deep, rasp came from within the monstrous form.\n\nSilence.\n\nMy body slumped against the wall.  I let out a breath, heavy, exhausted. \"I actually did it.\"\n\nA sudden skittering noise caught my attention. My head snapped up. The ghoul—the one that had saved me—was scrambling away, its awkward, too-thin limbs propelling it toward the exit. On its foot—was Derek’s shoe.\n\nIts foot had burst through the front, forcing it to run awkwardly on all fours.\n\nTears welled up in my eyes. A broken, disbelieving laugh escaped me. Getting up, I wiped my tears away, though they kept coming. \n\nMy chest ached, and my legs felt unsteady as I stumbled out of the room, desperate to find Ryan. I found him standing over the motionless form of the cloaked figure. Its head—what was left of it—was a pulped mess, smashed beyond recognition. Blood pooled around it, thick and dark, seeping into the cracks of the floor. \n\nThe sight made my stomach churn, but what truly scared me was Ryan himself. He was hunched over, his entire body trembling with each ragged, uneven breath. His hands were curled into shaking fists at his sides, coated in red. \n\nHis shoulders rose and fell in frantic bursts, as if he was still lost in whatever madness had taken hold of him. I barely recognized him. His face was twisted—jaw tight, nostrils flared, sweat and blood streaked across his skin. \n\nHe looked feral. \n\nLike an animal backed into a corner, running on nothing but pure instinct. \"Ryan…\" I whispered, my voice barely escaping my throat. He turned toward me slowly, his movements unnatural, almost puppet-like. When our eyes met, a chill raced through me. His irises were gone—just milky, glazed-over white staring back at me. \n\nMy heart pounded. \n\nThat wasn’t Ryan. That wasn’t him anymore. I stepped back, every part of me screaming to run—\n\n“Damon?” His voice was small. Fragile. Confused.\n\nHis eyes cleared. The white faded back into a warm, familiar brown. He blinked as if waking up from a dream. He looked down at his hands, at the blood dripping from his fingers, then at the corpse at his feet. He gasped. Both hands clapped over his mouth, smearing red across his skin. His knees buckled, and he crumpled to the floor, a sob ripping through him.\n\n“Ryan…?” I reached for him, but his body shook violently.\n\nHis voice came out broken, barely above a whisper. \"What have I done?\" Over and over again. I knelt beside him, hesitating before placing a hand on his shoulder. He flinched at my touch, his whole body recoiling like he didn’t deserve to be comforted. But I didn’t pull away. I helped him up to his feet. \n\n“Ryan, we gotta get out of here before the tranquilizer wears off.” \n\n**\\[END OF PART 4\\]**\n\n[Part 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/N9Eohq6IEs)"},"200":{"title":"My sugar daddy asks me for weird favors","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/diuucz\/my_sugar_daddy_asks_me_for_weird_favors\/","flair":null,"author":"EaPAtbp","selftext":"His Tinder profile said he was 45, but he looked to be in his early thirties at most. \n\n*Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.* \n\nIt sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. \n\n**Hey, there sweetheart :)**\n\nI cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. \n\n**Hey ;)** \n\nHis name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn’t a dream. \n\n**You still there?** \n\nI clicked on the message. \n\n**Yeah. Sorry. If you don’t mind me asking, what are you looking for in return?** \n\nI stared at the chat until he replied. \n\n**I’m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**\n\nThat sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. \n\n**Like what?**\n\n**For example, the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** \n\nThat sounded innocent enough, but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn’t that naive. \n\n**From the post office or something?** \n\n**No.  I’ll send you the address, but I’d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**\n\nKik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. \n\n**I’m not home right now, but there’s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** \n\nI grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. \n\n**Got it! Omw.** \n\nMy phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. \n\n**I’m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** \n\nI thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. \n\nThe house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. \n\n“You here for Jack’s shit?”\n\nI looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. \n\n“Uh, yeah. I guess.” I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. \n\n“Stay right there.” He said. \n\nI did. I actually don’t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. \n\nA few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. \n\n“Can you open your car?” He asked. \n\nI opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. \n\n“Alright, there you go.” He said. \n\n“Thanks.” I replied. \n\nI walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. \n\n“Oh, and one more thing!” He said. \n\nI looked at him. \n\n“Watch out.” He said. \n\nI didn’t reply. \n\nI blasted my music as I drove to Jack’s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn’t. \n\nI parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. \n\nIt was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. \n\nI opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. \n\nI thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. \n\nI walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. \n\nI set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. \n\nIn my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. \n\n**Don’t answer any calls that aren’t from Marvin.** \n\nI put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. \n\nI walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. \n\n*Incoming call from Jack.* \n\nThat was odd. \n\nI grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn’t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. \n\nI’ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack’s house. He had me meet one of his “employees” at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn total, I’ve made around $3500. \n\nMost recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. \n\n**I need you to spend the night at my house.** \n\nI hadn’t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. \n\nI drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. \n\nEverything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. \n\nI wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. \n\n*Lock the door when you come in.* \n\n*Only answer calls from Marvin.* \n\n*Don’t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* \n\n*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\n*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* \n\n*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*\n\n*I’ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*\n\nI made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I’d be perfectly fine. \n\nStill, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?\n\nNevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that’s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. \n\nI checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn’t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. \n\nI had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. \n\n*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\nI stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. \n\n“It’s the police! Open up.” \n\nI didn’t move. \n\n“Hello? It’s the police! Open up or we’re coming in.”\n\nI still didn’t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. \n\nThere was silence for a while after that. \n\nThen the doorbell rang again. \n\n“Hey, it’s Jack! Let me in!”\n\nIt sounded like Jack, but still, I didn’t get up. He would have a key, wouldn’t he? Why would he need me to let him in?\n\nThis continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn’t respond. \n\nI was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. \n\nI stopped at the entrance and peered in. \n\nIt was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. \n\n“Hey! Good morning!” He said when he saw me. \n\n“Hi.” I replied, nervous. \n\nI hadn’t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. \n\n“Scrambled eggs?” He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. \n\n“Yeah, thanks!” I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. \n\nI ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. \n\n“So how was it?” He asked. \n\n“It was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.” I replied. \n\n“Cool!” He replied.\n\nThere was an awkwardness in the room. \n\n“I think I’m gonna go now. I have class…” I trailed off. \n\nI didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. \n\n“Oh, no! Yeah, sure! I’ll talk to you some other time.” He replied. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. \n\nWhen I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\nI stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. \n\nBeside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. \n\nIt was the $1000 payment. \n\nI looked at my phone and then back at the list. \n\nMaybe it wasn’t an important step?\n\nAs I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. \n\n**I’m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you’re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**\n\nI stared at the message and read it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd once more for good measure. \n\n**I’m not in town right now.** \n\nI thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. \n\n**I’m not in town right now.** \n\nWithin minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn’t recognize. \n\n**Did you forget to do something? ;)**\n\nThe text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. \n\nI didn’t respond. \n\nNext came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. \n\nIt was followed by another text. \n\n**Watch out.**"},"201":{"title":"My wife has been peeking at me from around corners and behind furniture. It's gone from weird to terrifying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/sva7z6\/my_wife_has_been_peeking_at_me_from_around\/","flair":"Series","author":"Maliagirl1314","selftext":"\n\nMy wife \"Lynn\" and I have been together for six years and married for 11 months. Our entire history together has been very normal and never once have I noticed any weird behaviors or red flags. I can't stress enough how out of character this whole thing is for her.  \n\n\n\nLynn is very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. She's always been the no nonsense type of person. Being childish, or trying to scare me is not something she'd normally do. \n\n\n\nShe doesn't even like watching horror movies. When we first started dating she agreed to watch The Shining with me because she knew how much I loved horror. She was so scared that she didn't even make it through half of the movie before we had to turn it off. She isn't into anything creepy, and has never been into pranks. It's just not her cup of tea. And that's fine. But that's what was so strange about this. It's just so unlike her. \n\n\n\n\nI should also add that she never had any mental health issues and as far as I'm aware it doesn't run in her family. I know some people are able to hide their mental health problems, but in the six years we've been together I think I'd have seen some sort of sign. \n\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was in the kitchen making myself some coffee before work. I was running a bit late that morning and knew I wouldn't be able to make it to Dunkin Donuts for my usual morning fix. \n\nI took a sip of my coffee as I hurried down the hall towards the front door, when I happened to notice Lynn peeking at me from around the corner ahead of me. I could only see her eyes, and a  strand of her long dark hair hanging against the wall. The rest of her body was concealed behind the corner. I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw her. I did burn the shit out of my lips. \n\n\n\n\"Geeze, Lynn.\" I said, wiping a few drops of coffee from my pants. \"You scared the shit out of me.\" \n\nShe immediately popped out of view like a little kid that had been caught. I heard her scurry off towards the living room, and by the time I got to the front door she was out of sight. \n\n\n\nIt was really weird, and just totally out of character for her like I said, but I also found it kind of funny that she was being more playful and a little less serious. I shouted that I loved her, and called her a weirdo. As I shut the door behind me I heard her laughing.\n\n\n\nHer behavior was a bit odd, but it certainly wasn't something to call a priest over. I forgot about it by lunch and by the time I got home she was her normal self. I didn't bring it up and neither did she, and life went on. \n\n\n\nThe next incident happened three days later. It was around 2am and I had woken up to get a drink. I was standing at the kitchen island, jug of Oj in hand, when I felt a strong feeling that I was being watched. \n\n\n\nFor whatever reason I looked down at the floor and saw my wife's smiling face staring back. She was peeking at me from the other side of the island, staring up at me with wide unblinking eyes and grinning. Grinning like the Cheshire cat. \n\n\n\n I screamed, I'll admit it. Not out of irritation but fear. For some reason at that moment I was scared. \n\n\nAt the sound of my scream Lynn scuttled backwards out of my view, her hands and feet smacking the tile floor as she hurried out of the kitchen on all fours.  I didn't run after her, or even yell after her. I just stood there frozen in shock, wondering what fuck had possessed her to do that.\n\n\n\n It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to go back upstairs, but I eventually did. When I got to our bedroom, Lynn was lying on her side, asleep. Or at least pretending to be. I stood there for a while, watching her breathing to be sure she really was asleep. \n\n\nI had the feeling she might jump out at me the moment I got into bed. But she didn't. I climbed into bed and she didn't even move. Her breathing was soft and deep and I was starting to wonder if I'd dreamt the whole thing. \n\n\n\nThe next morning I waited for her to come down for coffee and after handing her a mug and kissing her cheek I decided to ask her about it. \n\n\n\n\"What was that about last night?\" I asked, keeping my tone light so I didn't offend or embarrass her. \n\n\n\nShe frowned over her cup of coffee, shaking her head like she had no clue what I was referring to. \n\n\n\n\"You were peeking at me again. From over there.\" I said, pointing to the spot on the floor by the kitchen island.  \n\n\n\nShe followed my gaze, and when she looked back at me she burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that I couldn't help but join her. \n\n\n\n\"You creep me the fuck out sometimes, you know that?\" I said. She giggled and set her cup on the counter and wrapped her arms around my neck. \n\n\n\n\"You creep me out all the time. So I guess we're even.\" She teased.\n\n\n\nWe said our goodbyes and left for work. As I drove I kept thinking about how creepy it had been seeing her grinning at me from behind the island like that. The sounds her hands made on the floor as she crawled away. I told myself she was just trying to be silly. Just trying to join me in my love of all things horror…. \n\n\n It's not like I was afraid of her. But it still didn't sit right with me. \n\n\nI started seeing her peeking at me more and more. Sometimes she'd be peeking out from behind the couch or living room curtains. Once she even managed to get inside her grandmother's old trunk that sits at the foot of our bed. \n\nI might not have even known she was there at all had the trunk's old hinges not given her away. \n\n\nShe'd had the lid propped up just enough so that  only half of her face peeked through. She'd been grinning like an excited toddler. It was unnerving. I didn't even know what to say to her. All I could do was stare. When I finally found my voice, I asked her why on earth was she doing this. She didn't answer, but she had slowly closed the lid, shutting herself inside the trunk. I just walked away, feeling disturbed.  \n\n\nI didn't understand why she was doing it, but it clearly made her happy. I just hoped she would tire of the game quickly. \n\n\nLynn didn't peek at me for the next two weeks. I started to think she was done with her weird prank and I was relieved. We were watching a show on Netflix one night and I jokingly said that I hadn't seen her peeking at me lately, and that she must have given up on her spy game. She looked up at me with a small smile and said, \"Maybe I've just gotten better at it.\" \n\n\nI didn't say anything but I wondered whether or not she was joking.\n\n\n\nFor the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. Was she still peeking at me when I wasn't looking and I just hadn't noticed? And if so, what the hell was she getting out of this? I started to feel paranoid, constantly checking whether she was watching from around the corner, or behind a door.  I was jumpy whenever I was home and she wasn't in full view of me. I felt stupid and a little crazy. \n\n\nBut after a few weeks without another incident, I began to relax.  I stopped checking behind furniture and walls and told myself it was just a bad memory. \n\n\n\nThen a few days ago things got so much worse....\n\n\nLynn left to go to a friend's, and I lounged on the couch and played a couple games on my laptop. \n\n\nAround 9pm I hopped in the shower and as I was washing the soap from my hair, I felt that awful feeling that I was being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and almost had a fucking heart attack. \n\n\n\nLynn was peeking from behind the shower curtain, her entire head stretched into the shower, leaving just her body outside. Her long dark hair hung against the curtain, the ends dripping with water. Her mouth hung open in a terrible grin, eyes wide and red, as if she hadn't blinked in a while. I screamed and jumped back against the wall. She didn't move nor did her smile waver. Her makeup ran down her cheeks in two black streaks. She looked giddy and completely deranged. I was fucking terrified. \n\n\n \n\nWe stood like that for a few moments, neither of us saying a word. Finally after what felt like forever, she slowly pulled her head back out of the shower, and I watched her blurry figure  through the curtain as she moved backwards towards the bathroom door. \n\n\n\nA second later the bathroom door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the mirror. I screamed again, and jumped out of the shower to lock the door. I stayed inside the bathroom for over an hour. Maybe I overreacted to some of you. But joke or not, I wasn't going to put up with the crazy shit anymore. That's what I kept telling myself as I paced in my bathroom, stopping to listen at the door every few minutes. \n\n\n\nSuddenly I heard a muffled sound, and I pressed my ear against the bathroom door, straining to listen. I couldn't hear anything but I envisioned Lynn standing on the other side of the door, giggling at her joke. \n\n\nI felt a surge of anger. I was beyond pissed at being made to feel scared in my own house, and made to hide in the bathroom for an hour. All for what? Some joke? If it was a joke it was an awful one. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck Lynn!\" I snapped. \"This shit is getting really fucking annoying.\" I waited for her to apologize, or to call me a jerk. But instead I heard a faint moan, so quiet I wondered if I heard it at all, and then complete silence. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn?\" I called out, not able to even hide the shakiness in my voice. I got no response. Just my own heavy breathing. \n\n\n\n\"I swear to God, just fucking stop it!\" I yelled, pounding my fist on the door. \n\n\nI waited for her to cuss me out, something I would expect from me talking to her like that. I never screamed at her before. \n\n\nBut there was nothing. Just the occasional drip from the shower head. \n\n\n\n\nI won't deny that I was scared. Too afraid to open the damn door and face my own wife. I waited another 30 minutes or so, which feels like a fucking lifetime when you're scared. Finally I decided I wasn't going to spend the night hiding in my bathroom, so I got down on my knees and peered under the door. I almost expected to see her face peeking back at me but thankfully I didn't. I could see straight down the hallway to the top of the stairs, but no Lynn. I didn't know if I should be happy about that or not. I looked for a few minutes, waiting to see her head pop up over the top step, but it never came. \n\n\n\nI stood up, my hand hovering over the door and mentally prepared myself to open it. I slowly turned the lock with shaky fingers, and was about to yank it open when I heard a sound that still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it. \n\n\n\nA moan, louder than before, but this time I was able to tell just where it was coming from. I turned my head to the closet door as if in slow motion, and locked eyes with my wife who was peeking out at me from the slight gap.  \n\n\n\nHer eyes were still wide as ever and her mouth was hanging open in the most grotesque gaping smile I'd ever seen. I didn't even scream. I was too scared for even that. Her hands were clasped to her chest, body trembling with sheer delight, as if she could barely contain her excitement. A short raspy moan bubbled up from her throat, deep and raw, sending a shiver through my entire body. \n\n\n\nSomehow I found the ability to pull the bathroom door open and ran as fast as I could all the way down the steps, snagging my keys and phone from the table in the living room before running outside to my car. I could hear her shrill laughter behind me but I didn't hear her getting closer. I didn't bother shutting the front door. I drove away from the house faster than I legally should have, shivering the entire time, either from fear or the cold. Maybe a little of both. I hadn't grabbed a coat or even a pair of shoes. I was still in my boxers and my hair was still damp. \n\n\n\nI drove straight to my brother Chris's house about 40 minutes away, ignoring any and every call and text I got. I didn't check my phone until I was safely parked in my brother's driveway. Lynn had called 4 times and sent a flurry of texts, all wondering where I'd gone and why I left \"like that.\" \n\n\n\n\nI threw my phone at the dash in a rage, furious at her nonchalant attitude. My brother and his wife were surprised to see me, especially dressed in just a pair of boxers, but told me to stay as long as I needed. Chris lent me some clothes and asked me what happened. I told him Lynn and I had a fight, but didn't get into the details. I didn't want him to think I was overreacting, leaving my wife over a prank, even if it was a strange one. I mean, hadn't I encouraged her for years to lighten up instead of being so serious all the time? I had wanted her to relax and loosen up, but this was definitely not what I'd had in mind.  \n\n\n \n\n\nI tried to sleep on their sofa, but my brain wouldn't let me sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I saw Lynn's face staring at me from inside the closet. Knowing she'd been in there with me the entire time made my skin crawl. She'd never left the fucking bathroom at all. Instead she slipped inside the closet and slammed the bathroom door shut to fool me. \n\n\n\nThe mere thought of going back home gave me anxiety. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chris ended up giving me a sleeping pill so I was able to get a little rest. My sleep was filled with terrible dreams. All of Lynn's smiling face. \n\n\n\nI woke up just as the sun started to rise. My sore body ached from the sofa, and I felt drained. I knew I'd have to call Lynn at some point, but I didn't know what to say to her. I wouldn't be going home unless she gave me her word she'd never do anymore creepy shit. \n\n\nI just wanted my wife back. Her normal serious self never looked so good to me. \n\n\n\nI was contemplating calling her and telling her that, when that familiar feeling came over me. I was being watched. I was staring at the ceiling, my heart in my throat. I didn't want to look away but the longer I ignored the feeling the worse it got. \n\n\n\nMy eyes drifted away from the ceiling almost on their own. Her face was pressed up against the window beside the couch, staring down at me with that same gaping smile. Drool dribbled down her lips, leaving two long streaks down the glass. I didn't know how long she'd been there, but something told me she'd been there quite a while, possibly all night. \n\n\n\nI didn't bother screaming, though I was afraid anger trumped any fear I felt at that moment. I jumped up from the couch and pounded my palm against the glass. \n\n\"Lynn! Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong with you? Just go home!\" I shouted. \"Now!\" \n\nShe didn't move, and her ghastly expression never changed. If anything her smile only grew, as if she had never been more elated. \n\n\n\nI could hear Chris and his wife moving around upstairs. As if Lynn could hear them from her place outside, her head twitched slightly in their direction, and she began to close her mouth slowly. \n\n\nChris called my name from upstairs, obviously concerned. I turned to see him and his wife Rebecca hurrying down the steps. When I turned back to the window Lynn was gone. The only sign she'd been there at all was the two streaks of drool still dripping down the glass. \n\n\n\nI tried explaining to Chris and Rebecca about waking up to see Lynn watching me through their window. They were skeptical, who wouldn't be? Chris and I went outside to the spot in front of the window but there were no footprints in the dirt, just a slight indent. Animal probably, Chris guessed, and I didn't argue. He and Rebecca assumed I dreamt the entire episode but they didn't understand, and I was too tired to explain it to them.  \n\n\n\n\nI called out of work that day and turned my cell off. I didn't want to face Lynn. Just talking to her was too much for me at that point. I really started to believe something was irreversibly wrong with her. That no matter what promises she made we'd never be the same again. The thought saddened me to my core. I cried most of the morning. By noon I figured I was ready to confront her. Give her one last chance to explain herself. I could at least give her that after 6 years I told myself. I turned my phone on and saw the dozens of texts she'd sent, all from a seemingly concerned wife. \n\n\n\n\"Can we talk?\"\n\n\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Please call me.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm really worried.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you answer?\" \n\n\n\n\"Just come home.\"\n\n\n\n\nAnd more of the same. All texts telling me she loved me, and she wanted me home. How worried she was….Not a damn one addressing the crazy shit she pulled. Like she hadn't been acting like a character from a Stephen King book. \n\n\nEven her texts were different. She normally texted novels just to tell me to pick up a loaf of bread! You'd think she'd have more to say to me after her bizarre shenanigans. \n\n\n\n\nI know it probably seems childish to some of you who are miles away from this situation. But if you saw the way Lynn had looked at me, how she scampered away on all fours like some wild animal, grinning at me from inside the closet like a lunatic…..then I think you'd find my reaction was warranted. \n\n\n\nI ended up staying with Chris and Rebecca for another night. I didn't wake up yesterday until after noon, and thankfully I didn't see Lynn's face watching me through the window. \n\n\n\n\"I don't want to pry, because it's not my place. But is this fight something that can be mended?\" Rebecca asked. She'd made us both a sandwich for lunch and I knew she wanted to breach the subject without seeming to be nosy. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know. I just….. She's like a different person.\" I said, choosing my words carefully. I still wasn't ready for her or Chris to know the full extent of the bat shit craziness I had been dealing with.\n\n\n\n\"People change Ben. But she's still the same woman you married. Maybe you both just need to talk through your issues. Whatever's going on, I'm sure it can be fixed.\" She said, ever the peacemaker. \n\n\n\n\"I think it's beyond that now. I don't think talking would help. I just don't trust her.\" I said. The words stung in my heart. I missed and loved my wife. But how could I live with someone like that? Living in constant fear didn't sound too appealing. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn loves you. She has to be absolutely crushed.\" She said.  \n\n\n\n\"I don't know about that.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\"Well she certainly seemed like it to me. I've never seen her so upset. Very much unlike the Lynn I know.\" Rebecca said, shaking her head sadly. \n\n\n\nIt took a full minute for her words to really sink in and when they did, I felt dread worming its way through my skin. \n\n\n\n\"Wait. What do you mean? You saw her? You saw Lynn?\" I asked, my mouth suddenly dry. \n\n\n\nRebecca nodded casually as if that fact wasn't nightmare fuel. Maybe for her it wasn't. \n\n\n\n\"She stopped by this morning just after Chris left for work.\"  She said, cleaning the plates from the table. \"I didn't see her car though. Maybe she took an uber or something.\" \n\n\n\n\"Becc. What did she say? Did..did she come inside?\" I asked, sweat starting to break out on my forehead. I began looking around, examining corners as though a predator lurked behind them. \n\n\n\n\"No. She just asked if you were awake yet and I said that you weren't. I asked if she wanted me to wake you but she said no. Just said to let you sleep.\" She said as she washed the dishes. \n\n\n\n\"That's all? She didn't say anything else?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\"No. She looked awful though. Like she hadn't slept in days. I think you should call her.\"\n\n\n\nI got up from the table and thanked Rebecca for lunch. \n\n\nI felt a little bit better at the knowledge that at least she hadn't come inside. Still, I needed to double check that the doors were locked. \n\n\n\n\nI sat for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I didn't want to go home, but I felt that I owed it to Lynn to help her if I could. Hadn't I swore an oath to love and honor her through sickness and in health? Clearly she was very sick. \n\n\n\n\nIf she was sick, which I truly believed she was, I had to try and get her the help she needed. But I didn't even know where to start. I didn't want to call the police, and besides, what the hell was I going to tell them? That my wife was peeking at me? That she was being creepy? As bizarre as she'd been, she still hadn't committed any crime. Not yet anyway. The police would have probably said that I was overreacting. But this wasn't some prank. It felt wrong. Dangerous even. Like something sinister lurked beneath her smile.\n\n\n\nI knew as her husband I was well within my rights to have her committed, but what if she simply acted normal in their presence? She'd obviously been able to fool Rebecca into thinking she was just a concerned wife. As long as the doctors didn't find her a danger to herself or others, they'd have no choice but to release her after 72 hours. I felt lost and overwhelmed. \n\n\n\nSo I did what any husband in my position would do.\n\n\nI called her mother.\n\n\nI didn't want to, believe me. \n\nHer mother, Marianne and I were never on the best of terms. We'd never fought or anything like that. \n\nShe just wasn't a very warm person, and wasn't really easy to get along with.  She hardly ever smiled and when she did, only her lips would move into a thin lipped smile, leaving her eyes as blank as before. She gave off this aura that felt like she was permanently on the offensive. \n\n\n\nI'd only met her twice and both times were for such short visits. I got the impression she didn't approve of me for her daughter. Lynn always ushered us out quickly, as she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable which I was grateful for. Being in her mother's company felt almost unbearable. Like walking on glass. I was glad when we moved three states away so we didn't have to see her often. I was happy to avoid the woman, but I needed her help.  \n\n\n\nI really didn't want to talk to her at all but I had to talk to someone and someone who knew Lynn better than I did. So I grit my teeth and did what I had to. \n\n\n\n\"Yes?\" She answered, already sounding irritated. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's me Ben. Do you have a minute to talk?\" I asked. I could hear her cluck her tongue in irritation. \n\n\n\n\"I'm in the middle of writing some checks, but if you insist, I suppose I can spare a moment. What is it that you want to discuss Benjamin?\"  She said, coolly? \n\n\n\n\"It's about Lynn. She's been... acting strangely and I was wondering if you had any idea whether there was something - \" I was quickly interrupted. \n\n\n\n\"It's a bit difficult to follow your rambling Benjamin, what is that you want from me?\" She asked. I could almost see her standing there in her thin sweater and slacks, tapping her fingernails impatiently on the table. \n\n\n\n\"I wanted to know if you'd ever noticed any odd behavior? Or possibly any mental health issues?\" I asked. There was a long, uncomfortable pause  that I couldn't tell was because she was just thinking, or ….something else. Finally after a few seconds she spoke. \n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure if this is one of your jokes Benjamin, but if so I don't find the humor in it. Now I do have business to attend to as I've said,  so if you don't mind -\" she said, but I cut her off before she could get rid of me. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's not a joke. I'm sincerely concerned about Lynn's mental health. Her behavior has been very erratic lately. I'm very worried about her and I figured as her mother you would be as well.\" I said, my frustration evident in my voice. \n\n\n\n\"If you're truly concerned then I suggest you get the health professionals involved. I don't know what you expect of me.\" She snapped. I could tell she was seconds away from hanging up and for some reason I was desperate not to let her. I had the feeling that she knew a lot more than she was letting on. \n\n\n\n\"Please. If not for me, do it for Lynn.\" I tried. \n\n\n\nI heard a faint shaky intake of breath, as if she were trying to hold her steely persona together but failing. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne? What's wr-\"  I started. \n\n\n\n\"Benjamin, I don't know what to tell you. My only advice would be to seek professional help. Do not call here again. Goodbye.\" I tried to call out to her but she'd hung up. \n\n\n\nI tried to wrap my head around the call and her refusal to help me. Even if she didn't like me, why wouldn't she want to help her own daughter? I couldn't understand that. I tried to replay the conversation, desperate to find something I missed.\n\n\n After a while I almost gave up, until I remembered her last last words to me. 'Seek professional help' she'd said those words with a bit of urgency. I could have just been grasping at straws but no, I was sure her voice had changed ever so slightly when she'd said that. As if they were very important.\n\n\n\n\nWhat had she meant? I assumed she'd been referring to medical professionals, but maybe she was referring to someone else. Someone that she didn't, for some reason, feel comfortable saying directly. Or maybe I was just desperate. \n\n\n\nI waited for Chris to get home and after a very long and exhausting conversation with him and Rebecca, I convinced them that Lynn truly needed psychiatric help. I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't prepared to go into it yet, but I told them about our last encounter. How she'd hidden in the bathroom, peeking at me from the closet. \n\n\nThey were obviously shocked but thankfully they believed me. They too just wanted to help her. Still they didn't think it was all that serious. Weird, maybe but not dangerous. They just kept saying that Lynn had to be playing some kind of weird joke. \"Maybe for YouTube?\" Rebecca offered, if only half-heartedly. \n\n\n\nChris didn't think we should involve the police just yet. He offered instead to go with me, and I readily accepted. He reasoned that calmly talking to her, trying to coax her into going willingly was the best recourse. I agreed to do it his way. At least I wouldn't be going into that house alone. \n\n\n\nWe drove over this morning, just after breakfast. There was no way I was going at night. When we pulled into the driveway my stomach began doing somersaults. Her car wasn't there, but I still didn't let my guard down. \n\n\n\nThe front door was ajar, and for a split second I thought we'd see her eyes staring through the gap. I was shaking and starting to sweat. Chris however was fine. He waited for me to open the door, his hands in his pockets like he was going on a fucking stroll through the park. I envied his ignorance.\n\n\n\nI pushed the door open and was immediately hit with the stench of rot. Chris smelled it too, and he walked in the house behind me with his nose scrunched up. \n\n\n\"What do you guys use to clean the floors around here, shit?\" Chris mumbled. \n\n\n\"Shut up.\" I said, my eyes darting around for any signs of Lynn.\n\n\n\nThe house was deadly quiet and dark despite being 10 in the morning. All the curtains were closed up tight, refusing to allow any sunlight inside. If I hadn't left it just two days prior I'd have thought the house to be abandoned. \n\n\nWe moved through each room, carefully checking any place that she might hide, occasionally calling her name. \n\n\n\n\"Why the fuck are you looking under the couch?\" Chris asked eventually. \"Aren't we looking for your wife?\"  He was looking at me like I was a moron. \n\n\n\n\"Let's just go upstairs.\" I whispered. He shook his head but followed me up the stairs to check the bathroom and spare bedroom. On the way up my shoes crunched over pieces of glass that looked to be littered over a few of the steps. \n\n\n\nI noticed that one of Lynn and my wedding portraits that hung on the wall along the staircase had been smashed. The frame hung crookedly, all the glass removed. I stared at the picture, a lump forming in my throat. We had taken the photo just after leaving the church, after saying our vows. She looked so beautiful in her white gown. I looked at Lynn's beautiful face. I never dreamed her face would ever be a source of terror for me.  \n\n\n\nWe climbed the rest of the steps and checked the spare bedroom, but it looked completely untouched. \n\n\nI was hesitant to go into the bathroom, my fear from that night coming back to me all at once. Chris noticed, and offered to go in by himself but I couldn't let him do that. So we walked in together, checking the closet and the shower. The bathroom looked as if it hadn't been touched since the night I left. \n\n\n\n\"I don't think she's here Ben. Why don't you pack some clothes and we'll try coming back tomorrow or something.\" Chris said. I nodded and went into our bedroom and shoved some clothes into a duffle bag. When I checked inside our closet I came across the source of the smell and gagged. \n\n\nChris took one look and lost all color in his face. He had to go stand by the stairs to get away from the sight and smell. \n\n\n\n I gazed down in shock at what lay Inside my bedroom closet. Soaking into the rug, were at least a dozen eyeballs, all carefully laid out in pairs. Some were as large as a quarter while others were as tiny as a marble. I stared down at the eyes she'd collected from small animals and I wondered how she'd gotten them, and shuddered at the thought. \n\n\n\"Man, I thought I had it bad with Becca's shoe addiction. But fuck me. Your wife's in here collecting eyeballs.\" Chris said, gagging.  \"Ben, I think we should go.\"  He called from the hall. \"I'm getting nauseous.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\" I grabbed my duffle and shut the closet door on my new nightmare. I stepped out into the hall and took a deep breath of air. I could taste the rot on my tongue and I couldn't help but gag. \n\n\n\n\"Who the fuck lines up eyeballs in their closet like that?\"  Chris mumbled. \n\n\n\"I tried to tell you she needed help.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\"She doesn't need help, Ben. She needs a fucking exorcist.\" He said. \"You coming or what? I can't stand the smell any- \" his words died in his throat, and his eyes grew wide with fear. \n\n\n\nI didn't ask him why. I could feel it. Someone was watching me and I didn't think it was the eyes in the closet.  I turned around, my eyes slowly scanning the bedroom. \n\n\n\n\"Christ\" I whispered, as I finally saw what we'd missed. Under the bed, curled on her side, watching us with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning, was my wife. \n\n\nShe held her hands together just under her chin, and they were shaking eagerly.  \n\n\n\nNow that she knew she'd been found, I could hear the quiet noises she was making. A sort of hiccuping sound in her throat, as if the excitement was just too much for her. It was unnerving to say the least. Wide eyes, and that same huge smile. \n\n\n\nEverything in me told me to run, but I forced it away. This was my wife. No matter how twisted, she was still the woman I married. I had to help her. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn…\"  I said softly. She didn't respond, but her head bobbed back and forth in two quick little movements as if she were nodding. \n\n\n\n\"Baby. I just wanna help okay? Can you…. Can you let me do that?\" I asked. I had taken a single step forward, approaching her like some kind of dangerous animal. \n\n\n\n\"I love you, Lynn.\" I said softly, taking another step closer. She let a tiny moan escape her wide open mouth and I had to resist the urge to run.  Her shoulders were starting to quiver, and her eyes grew as large as saucers. \n\n\n\nI crouched down so I could see her better, and immediately saw the blood. Her hands were covered in it. They trembled more the closer I got, as if she was barely able to contain herself. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn. Are you hurt? You're bleeding.\" I said. She bobbed her head again, her bloody fingers moving up and down as if playing an invisible piano. They occasionally grazed her chin, leaving smears of blood on her skin. \n\n\n\nI wanted to recoil in disgust. The smell that was coming off of her was revolting. I could feel the vomit trying to climb up my throat. \nHer lips were dry and stretched thin, blood seeping between the cracks. \n\n\nI knew she wouldn't come out on her own, but I didn't want to leave her in the state she was in. \n\n\nI scooted closer and reached out to her. The excited hiccuping sounds got louder and her hands shook, fingers flexing. It was then that I could see the blood oozing from in between her fingers. \n\n\n\n\"Oh my God, Lynn. You're bleeding.\" I said. Instinctively I reached out to take her hand, but before I could even touch her, her hand sprang out towards me. A sharp pain shot through my arm, and I fell back on my ass. My arm burned, and I could see the blood dripping down onto the carpet. \n\n\nI looked back at her in shock and saw her grinning madly, her fingers clutching a large shard of glass. \n\n\n\n\"You alright in there?\" Chris asked from behind me. \n\n\n\nI turned my head slightly, and nodded to him, cradling my arm to my chest. When I turned back to face Lynn, I saw that her focus had shifted. She wasn't looking at me anymore. And she wasn't smiling anymore either. \n\n\n\nShe was staring past me, her eyes glaring at Chris the way a hungry lion might stare at an antelope. Her mouth was still hanging open but it was twisted into a snarl.\n\n\nI got to my feet, and began walking backwards down the hall, afraid to take my eyes off her. \n\n\n\n\"Are you... bleeding?\" Chris asked. The moment the words left his mouth Lynn started fast scooting out from under the bed, the glass shard still in her fist. \n\n\n\n\"Chris. Run. Go!\" I yelled. He must have been too afraid to move because a second later I felt my back bump into him. He was still standing at the top of the stairs, staring at the horror that was my wife. \n\n\n\nLynn had crawled completely out from under the bed and stood in the bedroom doorway, her face twisted in rage. Her whole body was visibly tense. Blood ran down her fingers and onto the floor. \n\n\n\n\"Jesus, Lynn...\" Chris said, \"You uh… playing hide and seek?\" I reached back and pushed him towards the steps. \n\n\n\n\"Move your ass Chris\" I said as quietly but firmly as I could. \n\n\n\nLynn bobbed her head in fast, sharp motions, and began to grin, stretching her mouth open wider and wider so that her chin seemed to touch her chest. I heard Chris mutter a prayer and then he was running down the stairs. I stood at the top of the steps, stuck between the love for a woman who clearly needed serious help, and self preservation. \n\n\n\n\n\"I only want to help.\" I said, choking back tears. Her eyes focused on me once again as she slowly lifted the glass, holding it out in front of her. And then she started sprinting towards me, grinning with utter excitement. Thankfully my body took over and I flew down the stairs skipping two or three at a time. I made it to the front door before I felt her leap onto my back, wrapping her arms around my neck, her open mouth next to my ear so that I could hear those terrible hiccuping sounds up close. I shook her off me, knocking her to the floor. I felt a searing pain in my back as she went but I tore open the front door and bolted to my car. \n\n\n\nChris was standing in the front yard, talking on the phone with the police. I didn't say a word, I just ran to my car and jumped in. Chris took the hint and followed me, still on the line with 911\n\n\n\nI watched the rear view mirror, sure I'd see her there, running after us. But I never did. \n\n\n\nI went straight to the ER and got 11 stitches in my arm and 3 on my back. The police asked a lot of questions and went back to the house to do a search but of course, Lynn wasn't there. \n\n\nThey advised me to stay with a friend or relative for a while and to file a restraining order as soon as I could but none of those things would matter. Somehow I just knew. \n\n\n\nI dropped Chris off at home, and went to a motel an hour away. I wanted to put as much distance between me and Lynn as I could. \n\n\n\nThis is where I've been for the last 4 hours. I thought maybe the police would find her, maybe they'd get her the help she desperately needs. \n\n\nBut now I don't think so. Because 40 minutes ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just three words :\n\n\n\n\"I found You.\" \n\n\n\nAnd a picture attached. The picture was dark and grainy, but I instantly knew what it was. There was no mistaking my wife's eye. \n\n\n\nI started typing this out immediately after. I don't know what to do. I'm alone and scared, and I can't help but feel that I'm being watched…."},"202":{"title":"Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dyqd5e\/something_walks_whistling_past_my_house_every\/","flair":null,"author":"Grand_Theft_Motto","selftext":"Every night, no matter the weather, something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you’re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint, somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We’re towards the middle of the street, so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.\n\nWhen I was younger, my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn’t like that and we’d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.\n\nDon’t try to look at whatever was whistling.\n\nMy neighborhood is a funny place. I’ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept, good-sized yards, plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age, I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up, I’m old enough to see it. And there’s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.\n\nThe whistling never bothered me much. Like I said, I couldn’t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don’t like talking about it, so I’ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy, tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family, my grandparents, they’re from the islands. That’s what they call it. My dad, the only time he isn’t so calm is if the whistler comes up.\n\nHe talks a little quicker then, eyes move faster, and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule, the Big Rule: don’t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.\n\nNot that we could look even if we wanted. See, there are shutters on the inside of every window, thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock, about the size of what you’d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.\n\nMy mom…I don’t know what she thinks about the whistling. I’ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She’s not out there often, at least I haven’t caught her much, but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.\n\nThe whistler has the same tune every night. It’s…cheerful.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nRemember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well, besides our night whistler, everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It’s hard to explain and dad doesn’t like us talking about this part much, either, but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually, it’s small things, winning a radio contest, or getting an unexpected promotion at work, or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard, you know, the authentic kind.\n\nThe weather is pretty good and there’s no crime and everybody’s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. “A million little blessings,” I’ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here, why we moved here in the first place, is my sister Nola. She was born very sick, something with her lungs. We couldn’t even bring her home when she was born, only visit her in the hospital. She was so small, I remember, small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.\n\nWe moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here, Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn’t figure it out, they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew, even I knew, Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.\n\nSo that’s why we stayed even after we found out that, for every small miracle that happens here every day, now and then…some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.\n\nSee, our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They’re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk, gave me a Snickers bar, and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.\n\nThen the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was, really exceptionally, hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group, our new neighbors, warned my parents that the whistling was quiet, would never harm or hurt us, as long as we didn’t look for what was making the sound.\n\nThis part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change, sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong, would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings, stories about car crashes and ruined lives, public deaths and freak accidents.\n\n“Not everyone dies,” I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. “But the life goes out of ‘em. Even if they live, there’s no light in them ever again, no presence.”\n\nMy mom, I could tell she wasn’t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry, accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home, asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down, told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.\n\nAfter the committee left, dad went out to the hardware store, bought the canvas blinds, the latches, and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house, I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch, holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.\n\nAt exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nIt came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she’s grown into a strong, clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don’t get new neighbors often, why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in, my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole, a gift basket, and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad’s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we’d be getting new neighbors again very soon.\n\nNot long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner, Ms. Maddie, passed away at age 105. She’d lived a good, long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they’d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee, took my dad’s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope, whatever evidence, my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.\n\nOne night, when our new neighbors had to leave town, they sent their son, Holden, to stay with us. He was 12, a year under me in school. I didn’t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.\n\n“Do you know who is always out there whistling every night?” Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.\n\nThe three of us were sitting in the den, some Disney movie playing idly on the television.\n\nMy sister and I exchanged a glance. “We don’t talk about that,” I said.\n\n“I think it’s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner,” Holden said.\n\n“Mr. Toles?” my sister asked. “No way, he’s really nice.”\n\nHolden shrugged. “Must be a psycho killer, then.”\n\nNola tensed.\n\n“We don’t talk about it,” I repeated. “Let’s go in my room and play Nintendo.”\n\nWe spent the next few hours playing games, eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.\n\nAfter my parents had wished us a good night, locked the blinds, and gone to bed, Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.\n\n“Have you ever even tried looking?” he asked. “It’s nearly time.”\n\nLike most sleepovers, we’d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.\n\nI sighed. “We don’t-”\n\n“See, I can’t, I can’t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key,” he continued, ignoring me.\n\n“So does our dad,” said Nola.\n\n“No,” replied Holden. “No, he doesn’t.”\n\n“You saw him do it,” I said, a little sharper than I meant to sound.\n\nHolden grinned. “Your dad locks the blinds, yeah, but he doesn’t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.”\n\n“So?” I asked, worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn’t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.\n\n“So, after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed, I went to the bathroom. And on my way, I may have peeked into their room, and I may have seen your dad’s key chain on his nightstand, and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.”\n\nNola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.\n\n“You’re lying,” I said.\n\nHolden shrugged. “You can check if you want. Just open your parents’ door and look, you’ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.”\n\n“Stay here,” I told both of them. “Don’t move a muscle.”\n\nI hurried over to my parents’ room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn’t lying…my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door, barely an inch, and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath, I walked into the room.\n\nTwo steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly…from my parents’ room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don’t think I could have slept through it.\n\nI stood there, listening to the whistling come closer, unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.\n\n“Nola,” I yelled, running out of my parents’ room.\n\nHolden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn’t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.\n\nHolden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him, hunched up, afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.\n\nI think I made a sound, called out. I can’t remember. Time felt frozen, clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I’m not fast, I’ve never been athletic. Somehow, though, I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise, and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.\n\nBut I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time, I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.\n\nThe whistling stopped.\n\nI felt Nola shaking in my arms.\n\n“Don’t look, okay?” I told her. “Don’t turn around.”\n\nWe were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.\n\nI reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.\n\n“Holden?” I asked.\n\nSilence.\n\nI reached past him and gingerly felt for the window, eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window, searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally, I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.\n\nI opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen, I could make out Holden, pale and small, staring at the now closed window.\n\n“Holden?” I asked again.\n\nHe turned towards me and he *screamed.*\n\nEverything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall, then the living room. My parents’ footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn’t turn to look back at them, my eyes were glued to Holden.\n\nHe was pale, had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he’d wet himself.\n\n“What happened?” my dad asked from behind me.\n\nI managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. “He looked.”\n\nI’d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night, in that moment, an old, ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent’s fear.\n\n“Just Holden?” he mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded yes.\n\nMy dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad’s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nWe all froze. Holden whimpered.\n\n“Don’t answer it,” my mom said.\n\nShe stood at the threshold of the hall. I’d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.\n\nThe knock came again, a little louder this time.\n\n“Please don’t open the door,” Holden whispered.\n\nMy dad walked over to him, hugged him close.\n\n“We won’t,” my dad promised, still holding his bat. “Nothing is coming in here tonight.”\n\nThud thud thud\n\nThis time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us, wrapping my sister and me close.\n\n**Thud thud thud**\n\n“Call the police,” my mom whispered to my dad.\n\nThe knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.\n\n“Do you think-”\n\nHe was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.\n\n“*Police*,” something said from the other side of the door.\n\nThe voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom, like a parrot repeating the words back to her.\n\n“*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.” **tap tap tap** “*Police*.”\n\nMy mom pulled us closer.\n\n“*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.”\n\n“Please stop,” I heard her whisper.\n\n“I don’t think calling them will help,” my dad said. “How will we know when they’re the ones at the door?”\n\nThe knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment, I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.\n\nWe all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back, back to front, loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly, the sound was coming from both doors at once, big, heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house, then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.\n\n“STOP!” Holden yelled.\n\nThe knocking died.\n\n“I won’t tell,” Holden said, staring at the door. “I promise I won’t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.”\n\nWe waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it, a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.\n\nHolden started to cry, sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.\n\nMy dad held him, brushed his hair but never lied to him, never told him things would be okay.\n\nThe tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don’t know how long. Eventually, my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back, so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn’t take it.\n\nWe went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.\n\nThe tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That’s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents’ bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.\n\n“Okay,” he told us. “It’s done.”\n\nHolden’s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day, right at my side, sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn’t tell us what they said to Holden’s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together, ordered pizza and watched movies.\n\nThat night everyone slept in my room, Nola and my mom in the bed with me, my dad in a chair he’d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.\n\nWe didn’t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor, grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.\n\nI remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies, but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.\n\nI think Holden’s parents must have looked, either to comfort him if they didn’t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days, happy and young and alive, and I wonder if I’d been slower, if she’d looked out the window that night…would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I’m glad I don’t have to find out.\n\nWe still live in that house, in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings, the luck, the good things here are too good to leave. But we’re careful. We don’t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very, very well. Not that I’ve gone looking. Some things you just don’t need to look for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"203":{"title":"She Sold Happiness in Glass Jars","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/b4vyxc\/she_sold_happiness_in_glass_jars\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"The poster read, “Happiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!” and underneath the text was a phone number.\n\nI was walking home from a long, exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.\n\nI was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment, but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it—dinner, dishes, laundry, packing a snack for our daughter, putting her to bed, then putting her toys away that she’d left out in the living room—every night, it was the exact same routine.\n\nThe next day, I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job, so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.\n\nAt work, I was updating the company’s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly, so I decided to head out of the office early—it also helped that it was a Friday, and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.\n\nOn my walk back, I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Kelsey. I mean, I still do. We just don’t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship, whether it’s *meant to be* or not, some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage, and then you have a baby, then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool, then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah, blah, blah.\n\nI’m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I’m just saying I wasn’t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn’t have referred to myself as a happy person.\n\nAs I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back, I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don’t know why, I really don’t, but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says, “I love you!” on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it’s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI called. It only rang once before someone picked up.\n\n“Hello?” a woman said. \n\n“Uh, hi—um, I’m calling about your poster? Your ad?”\n\n“Oh, awesome,” she said calmly, “when do you wanna pick it up?”\n\n“Pick what up?”\n\n“The jar…” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n“Oh, of course, um,” I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey, so I could just go pick it up now and she’d be none the wiser, “what exactly is it? That your selling?”\n\n“I just told you. It’s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They’re more durable than, say, a plastic bag.”\n\n“Um, okay. Should we meet somewhere?”\n\n“For sure. I don’t want you to end up being a creep or something, so let’s go to a public place.”\n\nThe public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.\n\nNow, I didn’t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking, *Oh no, ‘happiness’ is probably a nickname for some street drug and I’m going to a drug deal. What if she’s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking, and so I did.\n\nI stood outside and texted her.\n\nMe: **I’m here.**\n\nHer: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**\n\nMe: **What are you driving?**\n\nHer: **Silver Camry.**\n\nAnd as her final text came through, I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car, which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement, looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand, gesturing for me to come over to her car, so I did.\n\nShe was young, maybe mid-twenties, with curly, golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch’s clothes.\n\n“Nice day out,” she said as a greeting.\n\n“Oh, yeah it is. Hadn’t really paid attention to it.”\n\n“You *were* the one that called about the jar, right?”\n\n“Yeah, that was me.”\n\n“Cool, well, here you go.”\n\nShe handed me a very small, glass mason-jar. It couldn’t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb—just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun, or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.\n\n“Pretty rad isn’t it?”\n\n“What—what is it?”\n\n“You’ve asked that, like, three different times, I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.”\n\n“What do I do with it?”\n\n“Keep it,” She said simply, “if you have any problems shoot me a text.”\n\nShe started to get into her car.\n\n“Wait!” I said, “I thought you were selling this? How much is it?”\n\n“Don’t worry, man,” she said with a smile, “you’ll pay.”\n\nShe closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up, then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again, its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.\n\nWhat was just a nice, sunny day, quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain, or else I would’ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.\n\nI walked up to my door and found that my key wasn’t on my key ring anymore. *Shit, I can’t believe I lost it again,* I thought.\n\nI knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice, “Hey babe it’s me, I don’t know what happened to my key.” I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.\n\nWhen the door opened, I was greeted by a large, heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee, he said, “I think you got the wrong door, bud.”\n\n“Oh!” I said, disoriented, “my bad, sorry, have a good one.”\n\nHe let out a chuckle as he closed the door. \n\nApartment number 33.\n\nI know that was my apartment. I know it was. I’d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside, all the furniture was different, it was painted a different color, it was all wrong. I felt like I’d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment, nothing made sense.\n\nI pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn’t in my phone. In fact, nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn’t looking? I would’ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually, but I couldn’t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before, but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office, I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.\n\nSince it was still raining, I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office, the whole time staring at my wet shoes, wondering what the hell was going on.\n\nWe have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet, always. But, surprise, surprise—it wasn’t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments, or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. \n\n**BZZZ** \n\n“Hey this is Tim, I must’ve lost my card. My employee number is…” I stopped as I drew a blank.\n\nA voice came through the Speaker, “Tim? You got cut out, what’s your employee number?\"\n\n“Um, I can’t remember, I—”\n\n“That’s fine, just tell me your full name and department.”\n\n“Uh, finance. I’m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.”\n\n“One sec.”\n\nAbout thirty seconds later, the man spoke to me again.\n\n“We don’t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?”\n\nI backed up in surprise, almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer’s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands, unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn’t in control, I was merely sitting inside somebody else’s head, watching the world through their eyes.\n\nJust then, I got a text. I recognized the number immediately, it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.\n\nHer: **Hey. How’s it going?**\n\nI looked at my phone, dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.\n\nMe: **What the hell did you do to me?!**\n\nHer: **The worst is yet to come.**\n\nI was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged, still glowing just as bright.\n\n“What the fuck did you do!” I yelled at the jar, realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.\n\nAs I stared at its glistening glass, I realized something. I didn’t know what my wife’s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well, I know it started with a K, or maybe a C. I couldn’t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes, because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just, couldn’t remember their faces then—or their names, or their birthdays, or any memories I had with them.\n\nI know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning, right? I couldn’t remember how she looked, or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding, right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter—or was it my son? Maybe I didn’t even have a kid. But my wife, or girlfriend, she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn’t see her in my head. I couldn’t recall a single fact about her.\n\nI was standing outside of the same building, but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face, making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn’t remember my parents, or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?\n\nI looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I’d ever been.\n\nMy phone buzzed:\n\n**Break the jar, Tim.**\n\nI looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky, I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn’t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head, and brought it down with one swift motion, shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.\n\nThat dark, chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off, and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm, yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created—like God had just snapped his fingers and said, “let there be light.” I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain, or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter’s night, but that warmth was covering every inch by body.\n\nAnd then I blinked.\n\nImmediately I could feel the sheets beneath me, and my back barely touching my wife’s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.\n\nI stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:\n\n**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**\n\nI called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter’s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn’t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. \n\nI got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn’t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually—she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying, or monotonous, or dull.\n\nBut not today. Today, I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.\n\nToday was going to be a good day. Today, I was happy."},"204":{"title":"A Shattered Life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7txais\/a_shattered_life\/","flair":null,"author":"M59Gar","selftext":"I don't know when you're going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.\n\nAs it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding, but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.\n\nThe solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.\n\nFor a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.\n\nIt was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.\n\nThe first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.\n\nThen, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn't understand how to fight back.\n\nMar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.\n\n\"Hey,\" I asked her with confusion. \"How'd you get a key?\"\n\nShe just laughed. \"You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?\" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. \"I know living together is a big step, especially when we've only been dating three months.\"\n\nLiving together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.\n\nMy things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.\n\nThe entity had eaten three months of my life.\n\nWhat the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.\n\nThat fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone's job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.\n\nOne day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.\n\nSurprised, I asked, \"Who are you? How did you get in here?\"\n\nHe laughed and smiled brightly. \"Silly Daddy!\"\n\nMy heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.\n\nThe agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.\n\nIt was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.\n\nThe church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.\n\nThe doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.\n\nBy the time I ran out of options, I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.\n\nBut the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.\n\nShe was happily surprised by the settings on the table. \"A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!\"\n\nThank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.\n\nThrough carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it. \n\nAnd so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, \"Writer.\" I told him that was a fine idea.\n\nThen, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.\n\nThat was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life, and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.\n\nBut of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.\n\nAs the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.\n\nA teenager touched my arm. \"Grandpa?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" He'd startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. \"Who are you?\"\n\nHe half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, \"It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?\"\n\nAhh, of course. \"Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.\"\n\nHe burned bright red. \"Trying to, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right. Run off, I'll read this right now.\" The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.\n\nIt seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.\n\nFinally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. \"How was it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's terrible,\" I told him truthfully. \"But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid.\" I paused. \"I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.\"\n\n\"You're far too young to be aware like that,\" I told him. An idea occurred to me. \"If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?\"\n\n\"Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.\"\n\nWarily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.\n\nFor a teenager, he took it well. \"You're serious?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. \"I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.\"\n\nWow. \"Sounds like a plan.\" I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. \"But how will I get all the notes in one place?\"\n\n\"Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them,\" he said, frowning with thought. \"Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern.\"\n\nFor the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. \"How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" He turned and left the living room.\n\nI peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.\n\nFinally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, \"Holy crap!\"—but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say *crap*.\n\nTaken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. \"Did I write those?\"\n\nHe looked up at me with wonder. \"Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this.\" He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. \"So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.\"\n\nThat much I understood. \"Right.\"\n\nHe gulped. \"There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time.\" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. \"But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can.\" \n\nTears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nAnd then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.\n\nI put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.\n\nI'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. \"Come on, I think I finally figured it out.\"\n\nI was so frail that moving was painful. \"Are you him? Are you my grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. \"The pattern finally revealed itself.\"\n\n\"How long have you worked on this?\" I asked him, aghast. \"Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!\"\n\nHis expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. \"It'll be worth it.\" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. \"Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.\"\n\nThe electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.\n\nIt was a parasite.\n\nAnd it was feeding on my mind.\n\nMy now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, \"Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?\"\n\nFearful, I asked, \"Is Mar here?\"\n\nHis face softened. \"No. Not for a few years now.\"\n\nI could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn't want it to be true. \"How?\"\n\n\"We have this conversation a lot,\" he responded. \"Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.\"\n\nTears brimmed in my eyes. \"Then I don't care if it hurts, or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.\"\n\nHe made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. \"I've worked for two decades to figure this out, and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness\/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. \"What's µ¬ßµ?\"\n\nHe paused his work and grew pale. \"I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky, believe me.\" After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. \"Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it's basically electro-shock therapy.\"\n\nI could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead, I'd just been with her moments ago. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything—at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. \n\nAs my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.\n\nThe electricity made my memories flare.\n\nMar's smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.\n\nI'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.\n\nNo. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts, but I hadn't wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.\n\nIt wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.\n\nThe fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.\n\nMy scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.\n\nOh God.\n\nI turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before—but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.\n\nI returned home in a daze.\n\nAnd while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.\n\nBut all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.\n\nBut now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.\n\nOn a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, \"Hey, who's this?\"\n\nEven though I already knew.\n\n---\n\nAuthor's note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He's still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn't recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.\n\n---\n\n[Blog](http:\/\/mattdymerski.com\/) [FB](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MattDymerskiAuthor\/) [Tw](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MattDymerski)[.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/cLqsc)"},"205":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/brco33\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":"Series","author":"Verastahl","selftext":"Three years ago I was looking at the local job classifieds online when one of the ads caught my eye, not because of what it said, but because it said so little.  Best I remember, the ad just read “Job available.  Good pay.  No benefits.  Discretion required.”  It then listed an email address and that was all.  At the time I was managing a music store, but I had already started hearing rumors we would be shutting down within the next year and the likelihood of a transfer to another store was slim. I had been morosely looking at job listings for the last few days, but this was the first one that stood out, if only because I was bored and it was weird.\n\nSo I sent an email.\n\nHalf an hour later I had a response, telling me to go to a particular office building in an upscale part of the city at a precise time for my “screening”.  I went, and after waiting for a few minutes in the lobby, I was taken into an office where I was given a series of forms and questionnaires to fill out.  They collected them and told me they would be in touch.\n\nI had almost forgotten about the whole thing until a month later I got a call saying I had moved on to the second stage of the hiring process.  I was again given an address and time, and when I arrived (this time it was a different nice office park twenty miles away from the first one), I was met by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Solomon.  He escorted me into a large room that contained a chair and a desk.  On the desk were two large monitors, a keyboard and mouse, and a bolted down metal box with two oversized buttons on it:  One red and one green.\n\nHe told me this room was a model for the place I would be working if I took the job.  He described the job as follows.\n\nI would be working seven shifts of six hours every week.  My job would be simple.  I would arrive at work ten minutes early and enter an outer area that was like a locker room.  I would have my own personal locker.  I would store all belongings in the locker and change into the provided work clothes.  I was never, under any circumstances, to carry any item of my own into the surveillance room.  I was never, under any circumstances, to take any item with me from the surveillance room.\n\nAs for what I was to do in the surveillance room, I was told that the monitor on the left would constantly show a live stream from a high-definition camera in a remote location.  My job was simply to watch the camera.  Once an hour I would get onto the computer attached to the right monitor and enter a brief log describing anything interesting that occurred in the last hour.  I would have no pens or pencils or paper, and I should never try to take any kind of written notes about the work.\n\nAs for the red and green buttons, the red button was only to be used if there was an emergency.  This meant something on the video or in my workspace that required outside help.  The green button was to be hit if I saw something on the video feed that was particularly noteworthy.  It would tell other people somewhere that, at least in my opinion, something interesting was going on.  Solomon stressed that while I was given discretion on when to use this button, I should err on the side of only using it if and when something “of real significance” occurred.\n\nHe pointed out the camera on the ceiling of the room we were in.  He said the real room would be the same.  My work would be observed, and other people were watching the room on the video feed as well.  He said I was only a redundancy in case other systems failed.  He then smirked and asked if I knew what he meant by redundancy.\n\nI nodded, trying not to show my irritation.  I don’t talk that good to people, so sometimes they think I’m dumb.  That’s okay.  Let him think that if he paid me good enough.\n\nThe pay was very good.  Thirty-five dollars an hour.  \n\nThis worried me.  I was already thinking this was some kind of psych experiment or secret government job, which I was okay with.  But that kind of money to sit and watch a screen?  My mom always told me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and this was seeming too good to be true.\n\nI asked if I was going to be doing anything illegal.  Solomon laughed and said no.  I asked if anyone was going to get hurt.  Again, he shook his head no.  He said the reason they were paying so much was because they needed employees that were motivated to be professional and discrete.  The work they were doing was important, and for various reasons it couldn’t be discussed.  If I took the job, I would have to sign papers promising I would never discuss my work there or I could be sued or locked up.  I’m only breaking that now because of everything that’s happened.\n\nSo I took the job, and because they wanted me to start right away, I had to quit the store with no notice.  I felt bad about that, but I was excited about the new job too.  It was a lot of money and seemed like easy enough work, if a bit boring.  I was nervous that there was something more to it, but I told myself I would just have to see.  No point in chickening out and wasting a good chance because I let my imagination go crazy.\nI was given the location of the job itself, and when I went there, I was amazed that it really was just like the model room I had been shown with only a few differences.  There was a locker room you had to pass through to enter the surveillance room and there was a small bathroom attached to the real surveillance room also.  The real room had a small water cooler in the corner, but because I wasn’t allowed to bring anything in with me, I had to eat before or after every shift.  The biggest difference, of course, was that the monitors were turned on.\n\nThe right monitor was just a black and white terminal like you see in movies some times.  I could type in my logs, but no internet to look at or anything like that.  The left monitor…\n\nIt was video from a room.  You would call it a bedroom I guess, because it had a bed in it, but it had lots of other stuff too.  A T.V., a sofa and chairs, a couple of tables, and plenty of empty space in between.  The camera must be high up in a corner, because I could see pretty much everything except for the far sides of furniture.  At first though, I didn’t notice any of that stuff.  \n\nAll I saw was her.\n\nShe looked to be a little older than me and was very pretty.  When I first saw her, she was laying on her side on the sofa.  That was the part of the room farthest from the camera, but the picture was very clear and I could tell that she was sleeping.  I found myself leaning into the monitor more so I could see her better, and then I thought about what I was doing and felt embarrassed.  It’s like I was spying on her.  A Peeping Tom, my mom used to call it.\n\nI didn’t want to be a Peeping Tom, but I didn’t want to be silly either.  I needed to think about it slow.  \n\nIt was a good job.  And I wasn’t doing anything wrong, right?  I wasn’t hurting anybody.  The woman looked fine.  And the room was nice.  She probably agreed to be there and it’s all some experiment or something.  I was just overreacting.\n\nSo I sat down in the chair and began my work.\n\n**** \n\nIt didn’t take long before I understood more.  The woman, I took to calling her Rachel, wasn’t there of her free will.  I never saw her hurt, but it was clear that she never left that room except to go into what I think is a bathroom area that my camera couldn’t see.  Well, she never left the room on her own.  Periodically, usually a couple of times a week during my shifts, men and women in strange-looking outfits would come in and take her from the room.  Sometimes she would struggle, but usually she would just go along with her head hung low.\n\nThey would always bring her back, though the times when she wasn’t brought back during my shift were always the worst for me.  I would worry about her until I got to work the next day and saw her in the room watching T.V. or painting.  She never looked hurt or even that upset except for when they took her, and even when she fought, they were always gentle with her.  \n\nStill, I knew something was wrong.  I considered quitting the job, or hitting the red button and getting someone to come so I could get some answers.  Or calling the police and showing them what the camera was showing me.\n\nExcept I was scared.  Scared of losing my job,  and scared of what these people might do to me if I quit or told on them.  Solomon had told me when I took the job that part of being discreet was not asking questions.  I would never be asked to do more than I had already been told, but I could never tell anyone what I did or saw, and I could never ask questions about what I was doing or why.\n\nSo I made excuses.  It was all an experiment.  She was crazy or sick and they were trying to help her.  She was doing a job just like I was.  Or if she really was a prisoner somewhere, at least I was watching to make sure that she was okay.  If they ever tried to hurt her, or I saw that she really didn’t want to be there for sure, I could get help then.  In a way, I told myself, I was helping to protect her by watching.\n\nI don’t expect you to think much of my excuses.  I don’t think much of them myself, especially now.  But in my defense, when things changed, I didn’t ignore it or try to explain it away.  I knew something had to be done.\n\n****\n\nRachel would usually paint for an hour or two every day, and it seemed to always be during my afternoon shifts.  The room had no windows as far as I could tell, but I guess she either used a clock or her own body’s time to keep to a kind of schedule.  I always liked to watch her paint—the thing she was painting was always facing the wrong way for me to see it, but I could see her face as she worked.  She always looked peaceful and happy when she was painting, and seeing her that way, smiling serenely from time to time as she got something the way she wanted it, always made my day.\n\nI first noticed something was wrong when she started painting more frequently a few weeks ago.  Her expression was more focused and serious, and there was a tension to her movements that I wasn’t used to seeing.  At first I thought she was just really trying to work hard on something, and I wanted to tell her not to worry.  Every few weeks the others would come in and take the old paintings out anyway, bringing in a new stack of…I think the word is canvas.\n\nBut it was more than her being focused.  Something was wrong.  She didn’t look happy and she was going for hours at a time.  In the span of three days, she had finished four paintings.\n\nI had been growing more and more worried watching her work, and when she finished the fourth, I found myself telling her to just stop and rest awhile.  I had grown accustomed to talking to the monitor, talking to *her* in my own way.  But she didn’t stop.  Instead she began moving the paintings.  Arranging them on the back and seat of the long sofa at the far end of the room.  \n\nThis was the first time I had gotten to see any of the paintings.  Even when the others were taking them out, they always seemed to be turned away from the camera.  I was still worried about her, but I was also happy to finally see something she had worked on.  Happy and amazed.\n\nThey were beautiful.  One was a beautiful green forest.  Another was an old stone well.  A third was a house sitting alone on a small island.  The last was an old-fashioned looking movie theater.  All of them looked like something out of a dream, with trailing lines of color mixing in the air around them like leaves caught in a wind.  It was only when I looked close that I realized the lines of color weren’t random.  They were words.  Easy to miss if you weren’t looking close, and by themselves, they didn’t seem to mean much.  Just the ghost of a word somewhere in each of the paintings, easy to lose in everything else that was being shown.\n\nI leaned into the monitor and squinted, trying to read the words.  Then my heart started thudding as I made them out.  Blinking and rubbing my eyes, I looked again, reading them out loud in order—left to right, top pair then bottom.\n\n“Please.”\n\n“Help.”\n\n“Me.”\n\n“Thomas.”\n\nI pushed back from the monitor, my hand over my mouth.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t know how any of this could be happening.  It wasn’t just that she was asking for help, though that was a big part of it.  \n\n[It was that *my* name is Thomas.](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)"},"206":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":null,"author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"I wasn't sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I'd share them here. I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. \n\n* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. \nThe first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. \nThe other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.\n\n* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\n* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.\n\n* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. \n\n* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.\n\n* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.\nOn just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. \n\nI have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know. \n\n**EDIT: Part 2 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"207":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

We’ve been together for 5 years now and we’re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I’m 22. He’s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn’t be happier to be living with him. \n\nWhen we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses, we couldn’t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.\n\nJamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I’m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don’t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. \n\nWe had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special, but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park, a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area, but neither of us had been wealthy growing up, we weren’t fussy. Just grateful to be together. \n\nThe advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections, but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I’d never heard of anything quite like it.\n\nWe knew that for our budget and location we weren’t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast, not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. \n\nMove in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together, it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos, getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42, on the 7th floor. The items we couldn’t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren’t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. \n\nIn the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa, given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. \n\nWe slept soundly last night, I felt safe and happy. I don’t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it’s all due to the note I found this morning. \n\nI found it in the kitchen, having a coffee, hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall, there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat, a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up), spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. \n\nThe note was handwritten with “New occupier of flat 42” in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can’t really describe it to you, so I’m going to copy it out below. \n\n*Dear New Occupier,*\n\n*Firstly, welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I’d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can’t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first, but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it’s filled with sadness.*\n\n*Anyway. When you’ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it’s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*\n\n*It’s a wonderful home, honestly, I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*\n\n*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn’t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let’s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*\n\n*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don’t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don’t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn’t do this. Just please don’t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*\n\n*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don’t question it, Mr Prentice lives there and he’s a lovely chap. Don’t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he’s old school, so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do, don’t check on him when you hear the noises. You’ll know when you hear them.*\n\n*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you’ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don’t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you’ll need some resilience. Whatever you do, don’t offer him anything. No money, no hot drink.*\n\n*5. Don’t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals, it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand, the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don’t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*\n\n*6. Don’t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor, all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They’ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\n*7. Simple one for you here, keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*\n\n*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It’s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It’s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn’t recommend babysitting Terri’s 2 children. She’ll ask you, because the poor woman needs a break, but if you accept don’t say I didn’t warn you.*\n\n*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they’re supposedly a special, expensive breed, but they don’t belong to anyone. They’re mostly  harmless, but don’t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It’ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn’t want to see them hurt.*\n\n*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning, but please try not to be alarmed, it doesn’t drip, it doesn’t get any bigger and it’s been there longer than I have. The landlord won’t budge on it, according the the agents. I flagged it many times, even called the police the first night it changed colour, but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It’s best to ignore it.*\n\n*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he’s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can’t include everything here, or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*\n\n*12. Finally, the first few weeks are the worst. You’ll feel like you’ve made a mistake, I’m sure reading this you already do, but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special, but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best, I really do.*\n\n*Yours truly*, \n\n*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*\n\nI don’t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can’t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they’d never met. \n\nThere were also parts of the note I couldn’t disprove, there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.\n\nOur dream, our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check, sure enough, two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. \n\nAt about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn’t want to take the risk until I’d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I’d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes, but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. \n\nMy windows were sparkling, and due to our lack of curtains I couldn’t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. \n\nWhen he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat, but I couldn’t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. \n\nJamie still hadn’t text me back, he must have been having a rough shift, it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn’t often that he didn’t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.\n\nI read the note probably hundreds of times over, I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. \n\nI hoped for that so much.\n\nBut Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn’t home. I panicked, I cried, I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn’t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. \n\nI thought about it, what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie’s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn’t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It’s getting late and he still isn’t home, what if it’s all true?

Shoot me in the temple, aiming slightly downwards. I need the bullet to travel the shortest possible distance through my brain before it hits my hippocampus. If I’m lucky, the sensation of the gunshot ripping through my skull will only last a few decades.\n\nAs awful as this sounds, you’ll be doing me an enormous favor. Death by a headshot, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, is vastly better than the alternative.\n\nMy ordeal started over ten thousand years ago, at 10:15 this morning. I earn extra money by participating in drug trials. I’m a so-called “healthy subject” who takes experimental drugs to help assess side effects. Once it was a kidney drug. A few times it’s been something for blood pressure or cholesterol. This morning they told me the drug I took was a psychoactive substance intended to accelerate brain function.\n\nNone of the drugs I had tested so far have ever done anything for me, in the recreational sense. In other words, none of the drugs I’ve tested have given me a killer buzz, or mellowed me out, or anything. Maybe I’ve always ended up the placebo group, but nothing I’ve tested had affected me at all.\n\nToday’s drug was different. This shit *worked*. They gave me a pill at 10:15 and told me to hang out in the waiting room until they called me back for some tests. “Only about thirty minutes,” the research assistant told me. I flopped onto the waiting room couch and read a few articles from a copy of Psychology Today that was sitting on the coffee table. They hadn’t called me back when I finished the Psychology Today so I picked up a US News and read it cover-to-cover. Then I read an old Scientific American. *What was taking them so damn long*?\n\nI sluggishly turned my head to look at the wall clock. It was only 10:23 am. I had read all three magazines in eight minutes. I remember thinking this was going to be a long day. I was right.\n\nThe waiting room had little bookshelf with some used hardcovers on it. When I stood up to walk to the bookshelf it felt like my legs barely worked. It’s not that they were weak. They were just slow. It took a full minute just to stand up off the couch, and another minute to take two steps to the bookcase.\n\nI scanned the old books on the shelf and picked out a copy of Moby Dick. My arms had the same problems as my legs. Just reaching one foot in front of me to grab the book took a long time. I actually got bored just waiting for my hand to reach the spine of the book.\n\nI slogged back to the couch and collapsed onto it in a slow-motion fall that reminded me of the low-gravity hops of astronauts on the moon. I opened Moby Dick (slowly) and began reading. I started with *Call me Ishmael* and got as far as Ahab throwing his pipe into the sea (which was all the way to friggin chapter *thirty*) before they called me back.\n\n“How are you feeling?” the research assistant asked me.\n\n“I feel slow,” I said.\n\n“Actually, it’s the other way around. Everything seems slow because you’re so fast.”\n\n“But my legs. My arms. They’re moving in slow motion.”\n\n“Your body seems like it’s moving slowly because your brain is fast. Your brain is running ten or twenty times faster than normal. You are thinking and perceiving reality at an accelerated pace. But your body is still constrained by the laws of biomechanics. Frankly, you’re moving much faster than a normal person,” she pantomimed a jogging motion. “But your brain is running so much faster right now, that even your fast walk seems very slow to you.”\n\nI thought about my slow-motion flop onto the waiting room couch. Even if my muscles had slowed down, my body would still react to gravity the same way. But in the waiting room, I even *fell* in slow motion. Slow muscles couldn’t explain why gravity seemed weaker. My brain was going at warp ten. That’s how I managed to read three magazines and the first thirty chapters of Moby Dick in fifteen minutes.\n\nThey ran a series of tests on me. The physical tests were fun. They made me juggle three balls. Then four. Then six. I had no problem keeping six balls in the air because they seemed to be moving so slowly. It was boring, frankly, waiting for each ball to move through its arc so I could catch it (with my slow-motion hands) and toss it back into the air. They threw cheerios in the air and I caught them with chopsticks. They dropped a handful of coins and I counted the total value before they hit the ground.\n\nThe cognitive tests were less fun, but very illuminating. Finish a fifty-word word search (three seconds). Solve an intricate maze drawn onto a poster-sized paper (two seconds). View a slide show projected at ten images per second and answer detailed questions about what I saw (95% correct).\n\nThey told me I measured over 250 on the Knopf scale. Apparently, that’s deep into the superhuman range of thinking speeds.\n\nThen they sent me home. “It’ll wear off in a few hours,” they said. “Which will seem like days to you. Try to use the residual effects to get some work done. Catch up on work emails while you’re still in high-speed mode!”\n\nThe ride home was *horrible*. It was only three metro stops, and in real-world time, it only took about thirty-five minutes. But in my drug-accelerated hyper-time, it felt like days. *Days*. Just walking out of the medical research suite to the elevator seemed like it took an hour. I sprinted out of the office, willing my legs to push me faster. But, the laws of biomechanics held me prisoner. As accelerated as my brain was, I couldn’t do anything to make my legs work faster.\n\nThe huge disconnect between my body and mind made it extremely difficult to judge how and when to slow down, turn, or rotate my body. I had basically turned into giant, slow-motion spaz. I misjudged my speed and rammed into the wall by the elevator button at a pretty good speed. Even though I could see the wall coming at me, I couldn’t make my finger, outstretched to hit the elevator button, move away fast enough and I jammed it against the wall. Hard. The pain was intense. If my brain had been running at regular speed, it probably only would have hurt for thirty seconds or so. But in my accelerated state, the intense pain seemed to last for half an hour. Forty-five minutes maybe.\n\nThe elevator ride was horrible. It felt like I spent four or five hours just descending seven floors, with nothing to look at but the interior of the elevator car.\n\nI sprinted to the metro station. I have to admit, this part was almost fun. Even though my body moved at, what seemed to me, super-slow speed, I could still carefully choose how and where to place my feet, swing my arms, and turn my torso. It only took a block or two to getting used to having a brain that ran two dozen times faster than my body. Then I basically sprint-danced the rest of the way, twisting and juking between people on the sidewalk and dodging moving cars with inches (a.k.a. minutes) of clearance.\n\nI spent an hour, in my time frame, descending into the subway and running to the platform. Endless tedium waiting the six minutes for the red-line train to arrive. Although there was more to look at on the metro platform than inside the elevator, it was still intensely boring. I should have stolen that copy of Moby Dick.\n\nThe red-line train roared into the station in slow-motion. The normally high-pitched squeal of its brakes was frequency shifted by my high-speed mind to a long low tone, like a monotone Tuba solo.\n\nIt wasn’t just the squealing subway train that was three octaves lower than normal. All sound was slowed to the point of near inaudibility. Voices were gone, shifted below the threshold frequency of my hearing. I did manage to hear a screaming baby on my subway car – her shrieks slowed to sound like whale songs. Sharp sounds like a car horns and trucks bouncing over potholes were low, muddied roars like distant thunder.\n\nBack at the research offices, I could still hear and communicate with the research staff. But now verbal communication with anyone would be impossible. The effects of the drug were still intensifying.\n\nI spent what seemed like days on that fucking red-line train. Days. Listening to the whale-song of the screaming baby and the Tuba solo of the brakes. Where ordinary voices were frequency-shifted out of my audio range, smells didn’t seem to be affected. I never became nose-blind to the body odor, the stench of the train’s brakes, and mélange of farts and other smells wafting through the metro car.\n\nI *finally* got back to my apartment. Sprinting through my open door and into the front hall at full speed was like a slow, relaxing drift down a lazy river.\n\nI was relieved to be home. At least I had stuff I could do there. I picked up the book I was reading – One Hundred Years of Solitude – and finished it. Despite turning the pages so quickly that I tore many of them, it seemed like most of the time I spent finishing the book was spent on page turning and not actually reading. Three minutes had passed since I got home.\n\nI tried surfing the Internet (my GOD it takes a long time for computers to boot these days) but it was too frustratingly slow. Hours (seemingly) to load each new page, and a fraction of a second to read it. A hundred articles in my news feed read and just three more minutes done.\n\nI dipped into my pile of yet-to-be-read books and finished two more. Four more minutes had passed.\n\nI decided to try to sleep off the remaining effects of the drug. Unfortunately, whatever part of my mind is responsible for perception, the part that’s been accelerated to hyper speeds by the drug, isn’t the same as the part that governs sleep. Despite being awake for what I perceived as days, my physical brain still thought it was 1:25 pm. It was not ready for sleep.\n\nNevertheless, I *tried* to sleep. I walked to my bedroom (a slow 45-minute drift through my apartment) and flung myself into bed (lazily falling like a feather onto the mattress). I closed my eyes and lay there for hours and hours (10 minutes of reality time) before giving up. Sleep would not come. I was facing what was going to feel like days, or maybe even weeks of being trapped in a slow-motion prison.\n\nSo I took an Ambien.\n\nThe sensation of the pill and the splash of water I used to swallow it sliding my throat was sickening. A lump that blocked my breathing, moving like a slug down my esophagus.\n\nI read a book. Ten minutes had passed. I read another. Eighteen minutes since I took the Ambien. I threw the book across the room in disgust at my situation. The book slowly pirouetted and spun through the air, like a leaf blowing in a breeze. It hit the wall with a long, faint rumble – the only sound I had head for what seemed like hours – then drifted to the floor like a flip-flop sinking in a swimming pool.\n\nThe force of gravity hadn’t changed since I took the pill. The laws of physics were the same. It was just my perception of time that had gone wackadoo. This meant I could use the speed things seemed to fall as a way of judging the effects of the drug. Based on how long it took the book to drift to the floor, I estimated the effects of the drug were *still* intensifying.\n\nI read a magazine. I turned on the television – I clearly saw each frame of video like I was watching a slideshow. Frustrated, I turned the television off.\n\nI read some more. The first two books of *Churchill’s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*. Not exactly a light read. Frankly, I hated it. But given the hours of tedium it would take to go get another book off my bookshelf, just sitting on the couch and reading Churchill was better. Or at least less worse.\n\nIt had now been thirty-five minutes since I took the Ambien. I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes. Time passed. I inhaled – a hours long process. Time passed. I exhaled for more hours.\n\nSleep. Would. Not. Come.\n\nI needed a new plan. I decided to go back to the offices where they gave me the drug. Maybe they would have something that could counteract its effects. Or at least something to knock me out until it wore off.\n\nI exited my apartment as fast as possible – taking hours in my time-frame to do so. I didn’t even bother locking the door. It would have taken too long.\n\nDown the stairs (it’s faster than the elevator if you run), through the lobby, out the front door and onto the street. These few things felt like a long day at the office.\n\nSprinting down the street, dancing and weaving between pedestrians with, what must have looked to them, superhuman dexterity. Down the first flight of stairs at the metro. Across the landing. Another hour. Then on to the second flight of stairs. That’s when the Ambien hit me.\n\nThe Ambien didn’t make me sleepy. Not at all. Instead, it must have had a severe cross-reaction with the experimental drug I took this morning. I was bounding down the second flight of stairs, moving in slow motion, but still making perceptible progress. Then, wham – everything stopped.\n\nThe dull roar of the street and metro noise ceased, replaced by the most perfect silence I’ve ever experienced. My downwards motion seemed to completely freeze. Before the Ambien kicked in, my perception of time was maybe a few hundred times slower than real-time. After the Ambien took effect, time moved *thousands* of times slower. Every second seemed like days to me. Even just moving my eyes to focus on a new point was like an impossibly slow scroll across my visual field.\n\nOver the course of the afternoon, I learned how to walk, run, and jump when my mind ran hundreds of times faster than my body. But with another four or five orders of magnitude of slow-down caused by the Ambien, body control was almost impossible. I fell on the stairs. Even though I was all-but-frozen in mid-step, controlling my muscles was impossible. I commanded my foot forwards for hours, then backwards for hours more when it seemed like I would miss the next step. Hours attempting to adjust the angle of my ankle, then re-adjusting when it felt wrong.\n\nDespite these efforts, I rolled my ankle on the next step. The pain wasn’t at all mitigated by the slowness. Hours of increasing strain on my bent ankle. The nerve signals that send pain into the brain must work differently than the nerves in my ear. Sonic energy was spread out over time, diluted until it was imperceptible. Pain flowed into my brain undiluted by the change in my perception of time. Hours and hours of increasing weight on my turned ankle turned into hours of increasing pain upon increasing pain.\n\nI pitched forwards, my high-speed mind completely unable to control my low-speed body. I drifted downwards for days, managing to rotate my torso enough to keep my head from impacting the ground first. I eventually landed on my right shoulder. At first the impact wasn’t even noticeable. Then I felt a slight pressure in my shoulder as it came in contact with the ground. The pressure grew, bringing increasing pain, for hour upon hour. My shoulder finally gave out, popping out of its socket with an endless sickening tug.\n\nI came to a stop days later, crumpled onto the ground, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my shoulder still screaming with the intensity of a fresh violent injury. I had plenty of time to think during that fall. If every second seemed like days to me, then each minute of real-world time would be like *years*. Even if the drug cleared out of my system in the next two or three hours, this nightmare would seem to last *centuries*.\n\nBy the time I hit the ground, I had a plan. I would somehow get to the platform and throw myself in front of a train.\n\nI twisted onto my hands and knees. Days of my dislocated shoulder crying for relief. I misjudged my rotation and rolled onto my back. I tried again, collapsing onto my face as I tried to figure out how to control a body that moved slower than grass grew. *Weeks* of effort were finally rewarded with success – I stabilized on my hands and knees.\n\nIf just getting on all fours was this difficult, I figured that walking or running was completely out of the question. So I crawled. I crawled through the metro tunnel. The dumb looks on the faces in the crowd lingered on me for weeks. I crawled under the turnstyle and onto the escalator.\n\nThe escalator spilled the rush-hour crowd onto the platform at the same speed a glacier spills ice into the sea. I looked out over the crowded platform during my interminable downward ride. The train status sign said the next train wouldn’t arrive for *twenty minutes*. Twenty minutes was like a year to me. I’d have to spend a year on the metro platform, waiting to die.\n\nI crawled off the escalator, enduring days of stupid expressions on the commuters’ faces. I crawled a few feet to a concrete bench and curled up next to it, trying to find a position to lessen the pain in my shoulder. Then my problem with time got worse. Impossibly worse.\n\nThe massive slowdown on the stairs was just the beginning of the interaction between the experimental drug and the Ambien. It fully hit me while I was curled up by the bench. I blinked. Years of darkness followed. Sound was already gone, and with my blink, sight was gone as well. All that existed was the pain from my fall.\n\nMy hyper-accelerated mind wasted no time compensating for the lack of sensory input. Voices spoke to me. They sung to me in languages that never existed. Patterns and faces and colors came and went in my mind’s eye. I recalled my whole life, and imagined living another. I forgot English. I settled into a profound despair. I spoke to God. I became God. I imagined a new universe and brought it to life with my thoughts. Then I did it all again. And again.\n\nMy eyes opened with geologic slowness. A faint glow. Weeks. A slit of light. Weeks. A narrow view of the metro platform – ankles of the commuters near me and an advertisement on the opposite wall.\n\nI extracted my phone from my pocket. A project that spanned decades. How can I even explain the boredom? The pain in my shoulder is nothing compared to the boredom. Every thought I can think, I have thought hundreds of times already. The view of ankles and advertisements never changes. Never. The boredom is so intense it’s tangible – like a solid object of metal and stone wedged into my skull. Inescapable.\n\nWhat are my options? If I crawl and fall onto the tracks without an oncoming train to crush me, I won’t die. I’ll experience even more pain from the four-foot fall, but I’ll most likely be rescued by some do-gooder on the platform and unable to act when the train finally does arrive. My suffering in that scenario will be endless.\n\nSo I wait for the train. So I can throw myself under it. When it finally hits me, I will experience the pain of being ripped to pieces for centuries until finally, the light of life leaves my brain, and my experience ends.\n\nI’ve lived hundreds of lifespans at the foot of this bench. I am far older, in spirit, than any human who has ever lived. Most of my life experience has been a snapshot of pain huddled on the floor of a subway platform, with an unchanging view of ankles and advertisements.\n\nThis post is my plan B. My Hail Mary. My long-shot. I’ve spent lifetimes typing and posting this message in the hope that someone will read it and become convinced that my suffering must end. Someone on this platform right now. Someone who will find the man curled under the bench, the man who crawled down the escalator, and kill him as swiftly as possible. A bullet to the temple.\n\nIf you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.\n\n[pfd](https:\/\/www.anewkindofmonster.com\/)"},"209":{"title":"Spacegirl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/declk8\/spacegirl\/","flair":"Spooktober","author":"HeadOfSpectre","selftext":"We called her Spacegirl.   \n\n\nHer real name was Megan Daniels, but nobody actually called her that. She’d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I’d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn’t like to be around us. She didn’t play with us when we were kids, she didn’t even talk much.  \n\n\nMost of the time, she’d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she’d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn’t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.   \n\n\nIt all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.\n\nIt had been raining that day, so we’d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.\n\n  “I can’t believe they let that retard sit in with us.” Sasha murmured, “Look at her… Why do they even let them in schools? They aren’t gonna learn anything.”  \n   “Better than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.” Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren’t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. “My Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.” None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  \n\n\nSpacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she’d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   \n\n\n  “What? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?” She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn’t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she’d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. \n\n  “What are you even doing in there, retard?” \n\nShe’d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. \n\n  “What even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?” \n\nShe handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. \n\n  “Wow. You can’t even draw. Look at this?”\n\nShe tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she’d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.\n\n  “Draw something that isn’t trash next time.” Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. \n\nSpacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn’t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they’d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.\n\nDuring the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.\n\n  “Wow, that’s really good, Spacegirl.” Was how most of her comments would start, “Did you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?”\n\nThere was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.\n\n  “Can you draw me?” Sasha asked once, “I heard that retards were always like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it’ll even look like a person!”\n\nSpacegirl didn’t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won’t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren’t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don’t know all the details, and I don’t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I’d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  \n\n\nJames had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn’t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James’ parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  \n\n\nWe were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I’d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.  \n\n\n  “LOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!” One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn’t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.\n\n “You fucking faggot assholes!” James yelled as he picked himself up.\n\n  “Hey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!” aughed Brian, “Come on, give her a kiss!” \n\nSomeone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn’t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn’t see Spacegirl until January… we didn’t see James or his friends ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn’t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he’d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual… I’d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  \n\n\nI went over to Sasha’s house on the day before New Years. We’d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren’t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.\n\n  “Hey! Kept me waiting!” She said when I knocked on the door.   \n   “Sorry.”   \n   “It’s fine. I’ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!”\n\nI didn’t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she’d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.\n\n  “You’re gonna love it.” She promised me, “It’s gonna be so funny…”\n\nShe led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  \n   “Where did you get this?” I asked, walking closer to it.\n\n  “Spacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day, she dropped it. I may have grabbed it… Y’know. Just for safekeeping.”  \n\n\nShe cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.  \n\n\n  “Look at this… She’s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn’t even finish this one!”\n\nShe paused at one small picture that was labeled ‘The Unicorn Prince’. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.\n\n  \n  “I figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I’d step up! What do you think?” Sasha wasn’t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.\n\n  \nIn her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed.   \nIn the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   \nIn the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building. \n\nSasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.\n\n  “What do you think?” She asked with a grin, “I’ll bet she’ll lose her shit!”\n\nI closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.\n\n  “A-are you out of your mind?” I asked. Sasha’s grin faded.\n\n  “What do you mean?”\n\n  “You stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that’s really messed up!”  \n   “It’s Spacegirl, who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?”\n\n  “You just… drew her killing herself over and over again!” I took the book off her desk, “Do you not understand what’s wrong with that?”\n\nSasha just stared at me like I was crazy.\n\n  “Fine. Sue me for trying to be funny.” Sasha said, “Just give it here…” She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her. \n\n  “No. You’re just going to put something else in there.”\n\nAnger flared in Sasha’s eyes.\n\n  “Jane, just give me the book.”\n\n  “No!”  \n\n\nI opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but  pushed her back. I didn’t mean to push so hard, but I did and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide eyed and shocked. I don’t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes… Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn’t let it go until I got home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha’s. I’d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I’d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she’d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she’d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn’t so sure.   \n\n\nI remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she’d done. I remembered the ones I’d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through Unicorns, Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha’s place, it had been blank, but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  \n\n\nI brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha’s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they’d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn’t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   \n\n\nI wasn’t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her sideying me. She didn’t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.\n\n  “Hey.” I said, “I’m… I hope you had a nice Holiday.”\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\n  “I’m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn’t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean spirited.”\n\nStill no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, then back at me.\n\n  “Sasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn’t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there…” I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn’t seem angry or thankful. She didn’t seem anything at all. Just stoic.\n\n  “I’m sorry if I wasn’t all that great to you before.” I said, and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. \n\nIt wasn’t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I’d done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Sasha got in, she didn’t talk to me. She didn’t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I’d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.\n\nThe Teacher hadn’t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  \n\n\n  “What do you want?” She spat. \n\nNow it was my turn to be silent.  \n\n\n  “Fuck off and leave us alone.” Tanya said, “You’d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don’t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It’s a quarantine issue.”   \n\n\nI stared at both of them, and I could’ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt… What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn’t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she’d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t really have anyone left… So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn’t happy with? I’d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she’d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.   \n\n\n**Your Words**\n\n*There is a land where your sorry may go.*\n\n*A sickening land where it always snows*\n\n*The snow is putrid in color and smell*\n\n*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*\n\n*Only your Father has been there before.*\n\n*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*\n\n*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*\n\n*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*\n\n*My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*\n\n*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  \n\n\nThis was unlike anything I’d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful… This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she’d thrown it out. It didn’t fit with everything else she’d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly… This was something she’d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn’t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I’d made her feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEighth grade wasn’t fun for me. \n\nI had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I’d punched her and stolen the book. Then I’d tried to kiss her, punched her when she’d refused, then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day, I’d done the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   \n\n\nSasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn’t pay her any mind.   \nSpacegirl barely changed at all. I didn’t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she’d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship… but it never felt right.   \n\n\nSasha’s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she’d pull the same old shit she’d been pulling since the fifth grade. She’d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it… but I didn’t always see it.\n\n  “Coming to her rescue again, huh Jane?” Sasha asked once when I’d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open. \n\n  “What’s she ever done to you anyways?” I asked, “She’s just minding her own business.”\n\n  “Oh? What’s she done to you, dyke?” Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.\n\n  “Unicorns… Unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns… When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?”  \n   “Hey! I told you to stop.” I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  \n\n\n  “Fine.” She said, “Tan, let’s leave the happy couple to their alone time.”  \nShe pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. \n\nSpacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.\n\nI turned to leave her when I heard:\n\n  “Thanks.”\n\nI looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.\n\n  “Um… You’re welcome.” I said, “Let me know if she bothers you again, alright?”\n\n  “I will. But… you’re usually there anyways.” \n\nHer voice was soft and low. I’d heard it before, but I don’t remember her ever speaking directly to me.\n\n  “Yeah, well. It’s just not right. She’s such a child. One of these days she’s going to have to grow up.”\n\nSpacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again. \n\nFor a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but… No. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn’t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I’d ever seen.  \n\n\nI went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I’d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn’t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.  \n\n\nThe Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the coke bottle glasses.\n\n  “You must be Jane.” She said. She wasn’t smiling, but she didn’t sound upset either.\n\n  “Yes ma’am…”\n\n  “Come on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.”\n\nThe house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn’t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  \n\n\nSure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she’d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn’t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing… But then I noticed her walls.  \n\n\nThey weren’t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.\n\n  “Holy shit, are these yours?”\n\n  “They are.” Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.\n\n  “It… it’s soothing.” She said after a while, “Painting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and… I finish them.”\n\nShe spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.  \n\n\n  “We should get started.” She said, “Sorry…”\n\n  “No, it’s alright!” I said. I sat in the chair for her. “I’d like to hear about it.”\n\nSpacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw… Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she’d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she’d always liked fantasy, and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could’ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   \n\n\nThe portrait she’d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful… but this made me look transcendent. I wasn’t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.\n\n  “I love it.” I told her, “That’s incredible Spa… Megan… That’s really great!”\n\n  “You can call me Spacegirl if you want.” She said, “I don’t mind the nickname… Not as much as I mind the people at least.”\n\nMy awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn’t look upset… She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No… not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there. \n\n  “I wish… I wish I’d been nicer to you, when we were younger.” I said.\n\n  “Is that why you’re here right now?” Spacegirl asked.\n\n  “No! I… I’m here for the assignment. I mean… the art assignment. The portraits…” \n\nShe continued to stare. \n\n  “Did you pick me because you felt bad for me?” She asked. \n\n  “No! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.”\n\nSpacegirl didn't react for a moment, but then she just nodded. \n\n  “Okay.” Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. \n\n  “Mom can drive you home if you need a ride.” She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn’t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?\n\n  “Alright. Thanks.” It was the only thing I could think of. “See you tomorrow.”\n\nWith that, I left her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art… and when I did, I wasn’t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late… but what she’d brought in stole my breath away.  \n\n\nIt was my portrait, but she’d done more with it than I thought possible. She’d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I’d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.\n\n  “Where’s your flower crown, dyke.” Sasha said, \n\n  “Leave me alone.” I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.\n\n  “I always knew you were a little dyke. But now you’ve posted solid proof of it! We’ve gone and cracked the case, haven’t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!”\n\nI tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.\n\n  “What’s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?” She snapped at me.\n\n  “Maybe she only fucks retarded girls.” Tanya said, “I’ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.”\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don’t know what it was about what she’d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I’m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn’t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.   \n\n\nNaturally I got a three day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they’d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I’d seen last time I’d laid a hand on her… and something about it scared me.  \n\n\nWhen I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they’d taken it down because I’d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.\n\n  “Someone took it.” Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.\n\n  “When?”  \n   “The day after you hit Sasha… I don’t think anyone’s found it yet.”\n\nShe didn’t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn’t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn’t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn’t put it past her. In the end, it didn't matter.  \n\n\nBy the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.\n\nThe words:\n\n***Retard Fucking Dyke***\n\nHad been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn’t know what to say or do… But this felt like too much.  \n\n\nThe picture was taken down quickly… but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn’t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I’d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she’d been crying.\n\n  “I’m sorry about the painting…” I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.\n\n  “I knew she’d do something like that…” She said, “I’m so used to it by now, that it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.”\n\n  “But you worked hard on that.” I said, “I’d be upset too.”\n\nShe just shook her head.\n\n  “That’s not it.” She said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. \n\nSlowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.\n\nIt wasn’t the same drawing… but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read ‘*Retard Dyke Wedding’.*\n\n  “There were so many in my locker…” Spacegirl said.\n\n  “This is what she drew in your notebook… when I returned it to you… This is what I had to take out.”\n\nSpacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn’t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I’d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though… When I looked back at her notebook, the Unicorn wasn’t there anymore. She must have just erased it… but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn’t been erased at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn’t know what she had in mind, but I didn’t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.\n\n  “What do you want?” I asked.\n\n  “It’s a surprise.” She said, “Sasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town… Oops, I’ve said too much.”\n\nI wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind… it wasn’t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I’d do.\n\n  “Come on, Dyke. Go home.” She said. “Let’s go check out your surprise.”\n\nIn a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn’t outrun her… I couldn’t fight her off. I didn’t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn’t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nTanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.\n\n  “Hey Jane.” She said, “How’s it going?”\n\n  “What the fuck is this?!”\n\n  “Just wanted to chat.” Sasha said with a cold chuckle, “You think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You’ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you’re fucking choosing, right? Right? God… I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you’re better than me just because you feel bad for her.”\n\n  “You’re crazy.” \n\nSasha just laughed.\n\n  “I’m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You’re absolutely fucking psycho!”\n\nOn the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.\n\n  “You wanna be a Dyke, I don’t care. But I’m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!”\n\nSasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   \n   “What the hell?” Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it… that was another story entirely.  \n\n\nStanding on the path behind us was a Unicorn… but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but… that was impossible… It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!\n\nTanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn’t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya’s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   \n\n\nTanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  \n\n\nSasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya’s body. She didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  \n\n\nSasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha’s leg tightly.\n\nStill with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting, and she took Sasha’s leg with her.\n\n  “FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!”\n\nSasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn’t overpower it. She couldn’t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.\n\n  “JANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!\"\n\nThe hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  \n\n\nSlowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey chalked Tanya’s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don’t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School was ten years ago though, and I’ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I’ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don’t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn’t like to talk about it and I won’t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different… but I don’t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn’t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge, there’s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl."},"210":{"title":"Something happened 63 years ago that's haunted me my entire life. I’ve never told anyone about it—until now.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/4ykg8g\/something_happened_63_years_ago_thats_haunted_me\/","flair":null,"author":"Sergeant_Darwin","selftext":"It’s official: I’m an old man.\n\nFor the last couple years, I’ve comforted myself by saying I’m in my “early 70s,” but math is simple and unforgiving. Today is my 75th birthday, and God, the years do fly.\n\nI’m not here for your well wishes; this is hardly a milestone I’m excited about. I’m glad to still be here, of course, but I find I have less and less to live for with every passing year. My bones ache, my kids live far away, and the other side of my bed has been empty for just over eight months now. In fact, once I cast my vote against that goddamned Trump this November, I may have nothing to live for at all.\n\nSo spare me your “happy birthdays” and your congratulations, if you please. I’m here because I have a story for you, and it’s one I’ve never told before. I used to think I kept it inside because it was silly, or maybe because nobody would believe it. I’ve found, though, that the older you grow, the more exhausting it becomes to lie to yourself. If I’m being perfectly honest, I’ve never told anybody this story because it scares me, almost to death. \n\nBut death seems friendlier than it used to, so listen close.\n\n*****\n\nThe year was 1950; the setting a small town in Maine. I was a boy of nine, rather small for my age, with only one friend in the world to speak of—and his family, seemingly on a whim, decided to move 2,000 miles away. It was shaping up to be the worst summer of my life.\n\nMy pop wasn’t around and my mom was a chore-whore—boy, was I proud of myself when I came up with that one—so I wasn’t apt to hang around the house. With some hesitation, I decided the public library was the place to be that summer. The library’s collection of books, particularly children’s books, was meager to say the least. But within the walls of that miserly structure, I would find no undone chores, no nagging mother (God rest her soul), and perhaps most importantly, no other children with whom I would be expected to associate. I was the only kid with a low enough social status to spend his precious days of freedom sulking amid the bookshelves, and that was just fine with me.\n\nThe first half of my summer was even more dreadful than I had imagined it would be. I would sleep in until 10, do my chores, and then ride my bike to the library (and by bike, I mean rusty log of shit attached to a pair of wheels). Once there, I would split my time between unintentionally annoying the elderly patrons and deliberately doing so. One pleasant lady actually interrupted my incessant tongue-clicking to hiss a “shut the fuck up!” at me—the first time I ever heard a grownup use The F Word. Big fuckin’ deal, I know, but in those days it was unheard of.\n\nThe dreary days turned to woeful weeks. I had actually begun praying for school to start again—until I discovered the basement. I could have sworn I’d roamed every inch of that library, but one day, in the far corner behind the foreign language collection I stumbled across a small wooden door I had never seen before. That was where it all began.\n\nThe door was windowless and made from oak that looked far older than the wall in which it rested. It had a knob of black metal that quite literally looked ancient—I wouldn’t have been surprised to learn it was crafted in the 17th century. Engraved on the knob was what appeared to be a single footprint. I had the sense that whatever lay beyond this door was forbidden to me, and therefore probably the most interesting thing I would encounter all summer. I quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was watching me, then turned the heavy knob, slipped behind the door, and shut it.\n\nThere was nothing; only darkness. I took a couple of steps and then stopped, unnerved by the totality of the shadow which surrounded me. I waved my hands in front of me in an attempt to find a wall or a shelf or anything to hold on to. What I actually found was far more subtle—a small string, dangling from above—but far more useful. I grabbed it firmly and pulled it down.\n\nBack in the day, lots of lightbulbs were operated with strings, and this was one of them. My surroundings were instantly illuminated. I was standing on a small, dusty platform that looked as though it hadn’t seen life in quite some time. To my left was a crickety-ass spiral staircase, made of wood and appearing ready to collapse at any second. The bulb was the only source of light in the room, and it was feeble, so when I peered over the railing to see what lay below, the bottom of the staircase dissolved into the darkness.\n\nI was beginning to feel scared. This place—wherever I was—seemed to have no business in a town library. It was as though I were in a completely different building. But no nine-year-old likes to let a mystery go unsolved. Looking back, I wish I could tell my prepubescent self to turn around, go back, do anything else besides descending that staircase. “You’ll be spared a lot of sleepless nights,” I’d say. But, of course, I didn’t know that then—and I may not have listened even if I had. So instead of turning back, I took a deep breath, gripped the railing, and glared resolutely forward as I began my descent.\n\nThe wood on the railing was dry and covered with splinters. I immediately let go, holding my hands out for balance as I carefully traversed the staircase. It was (or at least seemed) very long, and with only the dim glow from the string-bulb far above me, my heart pounded mercilessly in the darkness. Even kids can sense when something isn’t right, I think—they just don’t always give a shit.\n\nBy the time my feet reached the cement floor at the bottom, the light from the bulb above was very nearly a memory. But there was a new light source, and God, I’ll never forget it. Directly in front of me was a door, massive, and a deep shade of red. The light was coming from behind the door, and it shone out in thin lines from all four sides—a sinister, dimly glowing rectangle. For the second time, I took a deep breath and went through a door I shouldn’t have.\n\nIn contrast to the dank room I entered from, the room behind the door was blinding. When my eyes adjusted, what I saw nearly took my breath away. \n\nIt was a library. The most perfect library imaginable.\n\nI gaped in wonder as I stepped, almost reverently, further into the room. It was beautiful. It was smaller than the library above, much smaller, but it seemed to be almost tailor-made for me. The shelves were packed with brightly colored titles, both armchairs in the middle of the room were exquisitely comfortable, and the smell—my God, the smell—was simply unbelievable. Sort of a mixture of citrus and pine. I simply can’t do it justice with words, so I’ll suffice it to say that I’ve never smelled anything better. Not in my 75 years.\n\nWhat was this room? Why had I never heard of it before? Why was nobody else here? Those were the questions I should have been asking. But I was intoxicated. As I gazed around at all the books and basked in the smell of paradise, I could only form one thought: *I will never be bored again.* \n\n*****\n\nIn truth, boredom only hid from me for three years. It was on my 12th birthday, 63 years ago to this day, that everything changed.\n\nBefore that day, I visited my basement sanctuary as often as I could—usually several times a week. I never saw another soul down there, yet strangely remained free of suspicion. I never removed a book from that room, but instead would pick up a particular volume wherever I had stopped reading during my previous visit. I sat, always in the same deep purple armchair, and always leaving its twin barren and directly across from myself. That armchair was mine, the other was—well, I suppose I couldn’t have articulated it then much better than I can now. But it wasn’t mine, that’s for damn sure.\n\nOn my twelfth birthday, I arrived later than usual. My mom had invited a couple classmates and some cousins over to our house to celebrate, a gesture which I found more tedious than touching—really, I just wanted to spend my birthday sitting and reading and smelling paradise. Eventually, our guests went home, and I made it to the library about fifteen minutes before closing time. That didn’t matter; the workers never checked down there before they locked up. I was free to stay as late as I wished. This particular night, I was devouring the final chapters of an epic adventure; knights, swords, dragons, and the like. I didn’t smell it until I read the final words and closed the book.\n\nThe once exquisite aroma of that room had turned sour. I sat for a moment, unsettled. Objectively, I could recognize that the smell was actually the same as it had been before—that mixture of citrus and pine. I just perceived it differently, and I didn’t like it anymore. It was the nasal version of an optical illusion; you know, the one that looks like a young woman glancing backward, but all of a sudden you see that it’s really an old woman facing toward you? You can’t unsee that, and I couldn’t unsmell this. The spell was broken.\n\nThe odor also seemed, for the first time, to be coming from somewhere specific. With a fair amount of trepidation, I stalked around the room, sniffing the air like a crazed canine until I came to a shelf near the back. The shelf was perfectly normal, with the exception of one title—a large, leatherbound cover of solid faded maroon, with one striking black footprint at the top of the spine. This was the source of the smell. I opened the front cover, and saw one sentence scrawled neatly in blood-red ink atop the first page: \n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nI stared at this sentence, mesmerized, as I began to retreat to my chair. I turned a page. Blank. The smell became stronger. Another page, blank, and the smell grew stronger still. I stopped for a moment, suppressed a gag, and continued walking. Then, as I neared the armchairs, I turned one final page—and there, in the same sinister print, was the last thing I expected to see: my own name. I dropped the book. I began to sprint toward the door, but as I shifted my gaze forward, my heart leapt to my throat and I stopped in my tracks.\n\nThe empty chair wasn’t empty anymore.\n\nAn aged man in a suit sat before me, one leg crossed over the other, contemplating me with piercing gray eyes and a light smirk. This was all too much. I fell to my knees and expelled the contents of my stomach onto the carpet. I wiped my mouth, staring at my vomit, when I heard the man let out a chuckle.\n\nI stared at him disbelievingly. “Who are you?” I asked, panic in my voice.\n\nThe man leapt to his feet, grabbed me gently by the shoulders, and helped me to my chair. He sat, once again, in his own. “I fear we got off to a bad start,” he said, glancing at the pile of sick on the carpet. “The smell . . . it does take some getting used to.”\n\n“Who are you?” I repeated.\n\n“Tonight, you will know hardship like you’ve never before known,” he said. “I come as a friend, offering you refuge from it, and from all other storms which lie ahead.”\n\nI wanted nothing more than to leave at that moment, but I remained seated. I asked him what he was talking about.\n\n“Your mother is dead, my boy. By her own hand, in her kitchen. The scene is gruesome, I must admit,” he said in sorrowful tones, but was there a playful glint in his eye? “Surely you wish to avoid this path. I can show you a safer one.”\n\nMy blood ran cold at the horrors this man spoke of, but I did not believe him. “What do you want with me?” I demanded, trying to sound braver than I felt. He laughed, an old, raspy yelp that seemed to shake him to his bones.\n\n“Nothing but your friendship, dear boy,” he said. Then, sensing I found his answer inadequate, he expounded. “I want you to come on a journey with me. My work is noble and you will make a fine apprentice. And maybe, when I’m done”—he sighed tiredly, running his bony fingers through his thin white hair—“maybe then, my work can be yours.”\n\nI stood up, shuffling toward the door but never breaking his gaze. “You’re crazy,” I told him. “My mom isn’t dead. She’s not.”\n\n“See for yourself, if you must,” he said, gesturing toward the door. I threw him a contemptuous glare and bolted for the exit. As my hand closed around the knob, he said my name softly. In spite of myself, I turned around.\n\n“Your road won’t be easy, friend. If it ever becomes too much for you, and I mean ever,” he said, pausing to sweep his hand over the room, “you know where to find me.”\n\nI slammed the door behind me and took the decrepit stairs two at a time. I exited the library, clambered onto my bike, and high-tailed it home. The front door was wide open. I dismounted, leaving my bike in a heap on the ground, and approached the house cautiously. The old man was lying—he must have been. Still, tears began to sting my eyes. Heart pounding, I stepped inside and called for my mother. I heard no answer, so I turned into the kitchen.\n\nTo this day, I don’t know why she did it.\n\n*****\n\nI’ve lived in that small town in Maine my entire life, although I’ve kept mostly clear of the public library. Once, in my late 20s, I summoned the courage to step inside. Life was good at that time, and my fear had begun to morph into idle curiosity. Where the door to my basement sanctuary once stood was only a blank wall. I asked the librarian what had become of that basement, though in my heart I knew the answer. There was no basement, she said. There had never been a basement. In fact, if she had her facts correctly, city zoning ordinances prohibited a basement in the area.\n\nI’ve been haunted by that sickly-sweet smell, that poisonous blend of citrus and pine, ever since that long ago birthday. When I saw my mother in the kitchen that day, collapsed in a pool of her own blood, I smelled it. When a man claiming to be my father knocked on my college apartment door, begged me for money and beat me to within an inch of my life when I refused, I smelled it. When my wife miscarried our second child, I smelled it, and again when she miscarried our fourth. When our oldest son got behind the wheel of the family Buick completely shitfaced and got his girlfriend killed, I smelled it.\n\nI began to smell it periodically as my wife became sick. She died late last year, and now, I’m alone for the first time in more than half a century. Now, I smell it every day, and it feels like an invitation.\n\nA few months ago, I went back to the library and the small oak door with the ancient handle was there—right where it used to be. My evening walk has brought me past that library every day since, but I haven’t gone inside. Maybe tonight I will. I’m frightened to die, yes, but lately I’m even more frightened to keep living. The old man was right—my road hasn’t been easy, and I doubt it will get any easier.\n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nHe promised relief. A refuge, he said. Was he right about that too? There’s only one way to find out. After all, I still know where to find him.\n\n-----------\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCNzHOZrXbYUdvJCRtfrBLmg)"},"211":{"title":"Don't let them in.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bls5lo\/dont_let_them_in\/","flair":null,"author":"Coney-IslandQueen","selftext":" Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house, and Annie made it a home.\n\nMy sister Annie mothered me, with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn’t mind when I crawled into her bed later on, too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance, barefoot on the living room carpet, music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot, never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school, even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father, whoever he had been, but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too, like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer, remind mom less of her dad. I’d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time, even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.\n\nKeeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn’t make it any easier. When she was drinking light, she shone, would wake us up at 3am with pancakes, dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she’d had enough being drunk alone, she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we’d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days, sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde, her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind, I couldn’t tell who was mother and who was daughter, radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.\n\nWhen she was drinking heavy, she’d be out all night, hair piled up like a beauty queen, eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she’d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when, one day we’d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full, post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss, telling us she’d be back soon. Sometimes she’d bring guys home, filling the table with beer cans and ash trays, smoke up to the ceiling, mom lost in the haze. We’d sleep with pillows over our heads, trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am, and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning, asking us where we kept the coffee. \n\nWhen mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn’t buy food, refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She’d chain smoke, leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept, walking around with blue half moons under her eyes, knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor, backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats, head resting in the crater of my collar bones. \n\nWhen mom drank too much was the worst. She’d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything, until her mouth started to shake and she started crying, at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this, went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She’d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV, whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I’d cry when I’d find mom passed out cold on her bed, sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears, tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We’d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older, I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed, smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth, changing her clothes if she’d pissed herself. Watching them then, there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.\n\nIt was October and I was thirteen, Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She’d called us that morning from a pay phone, voice slurring down the line, telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends, hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents, strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn’t ask where she’d got the money for them. I didn’t care. We’d taken the bus to the beach with Jane, eaten the birthday cake she had made for me, sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea, and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down, Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles, wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home, that she’d just stay gone this time. \n\nBut that Wednesday night, me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us, seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We’d both laughed, Annie throwing her head back, gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I’d bent to pick her up, I’d caught her breath, warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again, hitting the floor and grinning, shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too, couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom, I knew she’d never get back up. \n\nI’d stared down at her, blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother, and then I was running, feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I’d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink, shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me, catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor, glass shards shining like we’d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them, pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows, the sky turned pale gold, clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then, watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie, always trying to fix things even when it was too late. \n\nThe smell of food dragged me from my room, stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta, real food not made in a microwave. She’d set the table, Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player, Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce, rich and warm. As we ate in silence, with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner, or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid, or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn’t mom.\n\nWe were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch, or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street, begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around, winding over my ankles, but Annie always stopped me, saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back, I don’t think she was talking about the cat.\n\nAnnie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little, we’d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now, making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. \n\n“Ah, yes, that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up,” she said, nodding sagely and hiding her smile. \n\n“Of course,” I said, waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. “Right next to The Ashtray, left there by angels on a smoke break.”   \n \n\n“Yeah, they say if you wish on it, all your dreams will come true,” said Annie grinning. \n\nShe stopped laughing, voice quieter, face tilted up to all those dead stars. \n\n“Let’s wish Emmy. Let’s wish” So we did.\n\nThe sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time, and definitely human. We turned to each other, confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby, lost and tired and alone. \n\n“It must be Mika?” I said, slowly getting to my feet. “Maybe he walked around the back? Shit, do you want to call Connie and tell her we’ll bring him over.” Annie didn't reply, and I sighed, rolling my eyes. “Guess I’ll do everything then.” \n\nI stepped off the porch, grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain, fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  \n\n“Em.” Annie’s voice was strained. I turned to her, smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. “Em get inside now.” She was staring out into the dark, past me, opening the door with one hand behind her, fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze, bare foot in the dirt. I’d found what she was looking at. \n\nIn the bushes by the back fence was a person, crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin, arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide, softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child, lost in the dark. Not like a child, but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound, open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened, snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin, too thin to be a normal person. \n\nPanic made me move, animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie, dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us, hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house, steps deliberate and long. \n\nAnnie reached for my hand, holding me tight and turned me to face her, holding my shoulders. \n\n“Don’t turn around Emmy. Don’t turn around.” Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face, hard, and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.\n\n“I’m…” her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat, gripping my hand tight enough to hurt, nails digging in, grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked, both of us grown from the same bones. \n\n“I’m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be…” her voice faltered, stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes, dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. \n\n“Your phone’s on the porch,” she whispered, and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs, charging. \n\nA soft, tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window, eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.\n\nIt was the sound of someone’s forehead against the glass, slowly, over and over. They started to speed up, faster and harder, skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed, followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. \n\nWe ran upstairs, two at a time, skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom, locking the door. A thin, wailing cry, like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway, trapped between the walls and locked doors. \n\nAnnie threw her back against the door, feet jammed up against the bathtub, clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same, shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs, deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking, almost laughter, shrill bursts of sound and then giggles, high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. \n\n“What the fuck is going on,” I asked Annie, not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor, and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom’s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her, terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands, thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist, a winding red road, still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.\n\nSomething slammed against the wall that mom’s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath, could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat, a wild and frantic thing. \n\n“I’m gonna get the phone from my room.” I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand, salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. “Yes. I’m gonna get the phone and I’m gonna call the cops and we’re going to be okay.” I shook my head again. “It’s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don’t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for… anyone. Promise me.” I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth, crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. “*Yes.* Promise me Em.” \n\nSomething smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face, gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible, bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside, like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed, handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. \n\nI sat with my back to the door, holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie’s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. \n\n“Em?” Came a voice through the door. I started, hands gripping the knife. “Honey what’s going on?” \n\n“Mom?” my voice cracked. “Momma is that you?” I wrapped my arms around myself, shaking, trying to keep myself still. \n\n“Sweetie it’s okay just open the door. It’s okay just let me in.” The handle rattled again, gentler. “Just let me in, it’s all okay.” She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. \n\n“Honey I’m sorry. I’m sorry I missed your birthday. I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother. Please,” her voice broke and she started to cry, “just let me in baby I’m so sorry.” \n\nI screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I’d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. \n\nMy sisters voice came through the door, warm and gentle. “Yeah Emilie let us in, it’s all okay.” \n\nMy hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door, handle rattling. “Emilie let us IN” Annie’s voice became low and guttural, followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now, pleading and crying, voice getting louder and louder. “Let us in let us in let us in,” over and over again, punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters, all the bedtime stories we pray don’t crawl out from under the bed. \n\n“That’s not my sister and you’re not my mother!” I screamed through the door, hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball, cradling myself, knife clutched to my chest. I didn’t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn’t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel, the one that sang  me happy birthday, the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades, the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn’t human. \n\nBangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house, filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed, covering my eyes, waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks, dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down, like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. \n\nOutside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her, lit up in the dark like a neon angel, face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her, holding us both together, broken pieces and all, standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away, smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. \n\nTurns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom, out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between, coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head, and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.\n\nAnnie had seen her in the garden, blood dribbling from her mouth, track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads, rail thin and desperate for one more hit, one more fix. She’d searched the kitchen for all the drink I’d thrown away and when she hadn’t found it, had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn’t wanted me, just the drugs on the other side of the door, so high she could mimic Annie’s voice almost perfectly. \n\nTurns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly, the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can’t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it’s up to you if you let them in."},"212":{"title":"I met someone who claimed to be the devil... and I think I believe them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8chsch\/i_met_someone_who_claimed_to_be_the_devil_and_i\/","flair":null,"author":"athousandrows","selftext":"Let me start off by saying that I’m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God, I’d probably just shrug, grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. \n\nOf course, that was before last night. \n\nMy friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties, snort a bit of coke, take a bit of e in the bathroom, maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don’t need that ride I’m offering after all. \n\nNot to say I don’t like a drink, I do, it’s just… clubs aren’t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere, drink in hand, listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for… I guess that’s my idea of fun. \n\nSo when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town, I say sure. I hang on for the first club, buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car’s required and try to pretend that I’m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls, on guys, when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer, well, I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren’t too far out, the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. \n\nThat’s when I wander out of the club, look for something a little more rustic. Not that that’s hard to find, not at all. \n\nI found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn’t a fan of the name all that much, but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. \n\nI tried to pretend I hadn’t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back, slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn’t at the club didn’t mean I couldn’t have a good time. \n\nI hung at the bar a while on my own, scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They’d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights, but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. \n\nI got another whiskey and bled into the background.\n\nOf course, stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn’t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in, laughing, chuckling, pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic, most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.\n\nThe bartenders seemed bitterly amused.\n\nSome of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots, gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. \n\nA couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. \n\nThis was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.\n\nThat is, until someone slipped into the seat next to me.\n\n“Do I look like a girl with daddy issues?”\n\nShe was of average height, although that wasn’t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim, with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face, a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow, smudged lipstick… hell, it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair, just by her forehead.\n\nThe drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.\n\nThe girl was clearly drunk, and as I looked around the bar, I couldn’t quite place where she had come from. She didn’t belong to the crowd of selfie takers, she wasn’t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn’t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window, to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated, bright haired girl, but I couldn’t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside, not enough outside.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked her.\n\nShe pointed her finger at me. “Answer my question,” she slurred.\n\n“Uh.” I really wasn’t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly, trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.\n\nThe girl’s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted, placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. \n\n“I do, you know,” she said, pushing herself up a little against the bar. “Have daddy issues, I mean. In case that wasn’t obvious.” She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she’d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.\n\n“What happened?” I asked her.\n\nHer hair had curled around her neck, I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.\n\n“I got in a couple of fights, no big deal,” she said, shrugging. “Didn’t start any of course, no, I don’t do that. But my father…”\n\n“Your dad did this to you?”\n\nShe smiled brightly. “In a way.”\n\n“Do you need me to call someone?” I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline, which wasn’t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus, was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?\n\nThe girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. “No,” she told me. “I don’t want you to call anyone.” Now her expression changed. It wasn’t the attempted sultry look I’d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. “I want something else.”\n\n“What do you want?” I asked her.\n\n“To tell you a story,” the girl said, before glancing to the bar, “and for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I’m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.”\n\nI laughed. I didn’t know this girl, didn’t know where she’d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren’t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then, but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand, I knew that this wasn’t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.\n\nI guess I was okay with that.\n\n“What’s your poison?” I asked her.\n\nHer lips quirked. “Appletini.”\n\nThe bar offered a very limited cocktail menu, but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it, suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I’d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back – the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn’t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools, I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.\n\nThe girl coddled her drink, running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. “This takes me back,” the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly, her green eyes startling. “You know what this was called originally?” She smirked before I could answer. “An Adam’s Apple Martini.”\n\nI snorted. “Yeah, I think I’ve heard that before.”\n\n“Of course, it wasn’t actually an apple,” she continued, eyes moving back to her glass. “The texts translated that part wrongly, mostly because you people don’t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and, to be honest, it doesn’t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.” She laughed dreamily. “And Eden’s long gone.”\n\nI stared at her. “Are you… okay?” It was more honest than the last time I’d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.\n\n“Of course,” the girl said, grinning widely. “Why do you keep asking?”\n\n“I mean,” I stuttered, “I just, now, don’t take this the wrong way or anything but… you look…”\n\n“Like someone poured their drink over me?” the girl asked. “Like someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit, slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?”\n\nShe held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. “Yeah, something like that.”\n\n“Why would they do that?” I asked.\n\n“Why wouldn’t they?” the girl shot back. “People aren’t that great and alcohol makes them worse.” She shrugged. “Sometimes makes them better. Nicer, a little looser in the sack… but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.”\n\nI looked at her, I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were, but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. \n\nThe girl looked at me again. “You bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.”\n\nI nodded wordlessly.\n\nShe smiled, pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. \n\n“Eden,” the girl said, reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. “They always think that’s my fault, you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.” She shot me a knowing glance. “Only in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.”\n\nI blinked. “I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m not following.”\n\n“Sorry,” the girl said. “My story won’t make any sense without a proper introduction.” She reached out her hand. “Hello. My name’s Lucifer.” She winked. “But you can call me Lucy.”\n\nThere’s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.\n\nA lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters, that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she’d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment, I hadn’t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes, she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn’t come off as catty or rude. \n\nIf she’d been going around telling people she was the devil, though? That gets a reaction out of people.\n\nI suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist, down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?\n\nI really would have to call the cops.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking,” the girl – Lucy – said. “You’re thinking that I’m crazy, that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I’m aggressive.”\n\n“Are you?” I asked her.\n\n“Would I be here with you, drinking Appletinis if I were?” she asked, fluttering her eyelashes.\n\n“Would you look the way you do if you weren’t?” I shot back.\n\nShe grinned, toasting her new glass. “Touché.”\n\nUnthinkingly, I clinked my cider against it.\n\nThen I frowned.\n\nShe chuckled, leaning closer. “Let’s have a little wager,” she said. “Let me tell you my story and, if you believe me when I’m done, you can’t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.”\n\nI stared at her. “If I ended up believing you, then why would I do that?”\n\nShe smirked, sipping her drink. “You’d be surprised what people do when they believe you’re the devil.”\n\n“And you do this often?” I asked. “Tell people you’re Satan?”\n\nShe snorted into her drink. “Not as often as I should. But it’s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I’d like to have a chat if that’s alright with you.”\n\nI waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl’s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn’t necessarily trapped with her, but a part of me didn’t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides, at the end of it all I couldn’t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.\n\n“So,” I said, taking a swig of my drink. “Eden?”\n\nLucy laughed. \n\n“Adam and Eve?” I continued. “You’re saying that’s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?”\n\n“God made two prototypes,” Lucy corrected with a raised finger. “My father created angels as his toy soldiers, but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us, it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of, but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.”\n\n“And did they?”\n\nLucy’s face soured. “No. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh… my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.”\n\nLucy was very adamant in her delusions, that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.\n\n“And what?” I asked her, entertaining her delusion. “You were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?”\n\nShe smiled. “I dabble.” Then she looked at me, raising a brow. “All of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake’s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.” She laughed, a hard and short sound. “Snakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.”\n\nHer shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip, but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.\n\n“I was the favoured child, my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer, I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.” She pursed her lips, slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. “My father couldn’t bring himself to go that extra mile, so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.” \n\n“You’re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?” I asked her sceptically. \n\n“I’m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong, left and right, all that stuff.” Lucy shrugged. “Are you familiar with the story of Prometheus?”\n\nI frowned at her. “Greek, right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something, to help…” The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I’d been heading.\n\nLucy grinned. “Correct,” she said, cutting off my attempt. “Prometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You’ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve, to move forward, to create. God was the creator, and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.” She shrugged impassively. “Now the world sees me as the ultimate evil.”\n\n“If what you’re saying is true,” I said slowly, “then God must be just like us.”\n\nLucy’s lips thinned into a feral smile. “My father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image, but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy, the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.”\n\n“Angels don’t have free will?”\n\n“No,” Lucy said, “they don’t.”\n\n“And what about the Devil?”\n\nI don’t know why I was suddenly so intrigued, but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child, but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome, but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.\n\n“The Devil has will of her own,” Lucy said, tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. “By guiding Eve to the tree, something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator, but once I had been given free will, I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely, passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes, only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.”\n\n“He wouldn’t be able to control them,” I said.\n\nLucy nodded. “Exactly. And after, he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.”\n\n“So he sent you to Hell.”\n\nLucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”\n\nI sobered a little, straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.\n\n“I tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default, but they wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t understand free will – how could they? I only knew it because I’d been given it by mistake. At that moment, I didn’t even know that I had free will, only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father’s flaws. My siblings couldn’t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.”\n\nLucy sighed heavily. “Adam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father’s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge, my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me, I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.” Lucy’s eyes were heavy-lidded, her sadness was almost palpable. “I thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all, we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while, but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.” She smiled weakly. “He blamed me.”\n\nLucy’s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant, somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers, and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I’d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused, and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me – a complete and total stranger.\n\nI respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it, I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly, letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.\n\n“It became clear,” Lucy said after a long moment’s pause, “that I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn’t follow my father’s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so, eventually, I was met by many of them, headed by my father. He told me all that I feared, he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn’t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.”\n\nA long silence stretched between us, only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn’t touch mine.\n\n“I am afraid,” Lucy said quietly, “that this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.”\n\n“Why?” I asked. “Because your dad threw you out?” I paused, trying to abide to her metaphor. “That he put you in Hell?”\n\nLucy laughed sadly. “Ah, humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.” She shook her head. “No, not because he put me in Hell.”\n\n“Then why?” \n\n“I fell to Earth,” Lucy said. “Father gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will, so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?” She snorted dismally. “Of course, that’s not quite right, is it? When I fell, I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father’s little prototypes.”\n\nHer tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.\n\n“I saw emperors and kings, governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers, presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost, and finally, just finally, they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren’t as free as they thought they were. Sure, they live under the illusion that they have free lives, but most of them simply do not.” She clicked her tongue. “I grew to loathe you all.”\n\nThen, she took another hit of her drink.\n\n“I can see what you mean,” I said, allowing my gaze – for the first time since meeting her – to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones, the boys trying desperately to sober up, the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives, and we were all here to get drunk, to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn’t been the first time that I’d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn’t the only person to think it.\n\n“You hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will,” Lucy said, waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. “It’s true – my father gave you the will to make those decisions, but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you, the free will I was given by a twisted mistake, and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them, you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own, not of others.”\n\n“That isn’t all of us, though, is it?” I asked her, trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. “Because you see it on the news all the time, don’t you? People do rise up, we do protest. People can make a difference.”\n\nLucy laughed bitterly, nibbling the rim of her glass. “Really?” she said. “You can sit here and say that it can’t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?” She grinned around her glass. “By that logic, I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?”\n\n“By your logic,” I said, “you should be punishing it, right? If that’s what this metaphor is all about.” I laughed, I couldn’t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. “Is this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we’re all going to Hell? If so, I think I can see why people want to punch you.”\n\nLucy didn’t say a word. Simply, she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that, with an intelligence that went beyond anything I’d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present, her face wasn’t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn’t represent the mess I’d seen when she’d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.\n\nAnd I was afraid.\n\n“Let’s review what you’ve said,” Lucy said slowly, articulately. She wasn’t slurring. Had she been slurring before? “You think I’m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.” Her nails curled into the bar. “My father may have been the one to guide me, but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species, but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here, not me.”\n\nShe pursed her lips, tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. “Tell me, do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story, or was that just you?”\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.\n\nLucy smiled, taking a sip. “Thought not.” She looked away, eyes scanning the room lazily. “What I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.” Her lip twisted. “Humans sin all the time. Not because of me, not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is, I don’t lift a finger. I don’t, because I don’t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders, you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.” Lucy’s eyes lit up. “Do you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured, but aren’t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused, raped, forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don’t believe in?”\n\nI stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy’s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.\n\n“War, famine, pestilence, death, these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will, but your inability to use it.” \n\nLucy smiled at me, a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was, frozen to my very core, because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.\n\n“And here’s the kicker,” Lucy said. “Because this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.” She winked. “Hell isn’t what happens after you die. Hell is right here, right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures, a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is, Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I… I refuse to do anything.”\n\n“What are you saying?” I asked, because I was suddenly very desperate.\n\n“Exactly what you think,” Lucy said, toasting her glass. I didn’t reciprocate, and she laughed. A light and airy sound. “I had so many plans for your species, I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together, to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels – his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately, you humans just don’t want that.” She shrugged. “My father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.”\n\n“Stop,” I said. “This isn’t funny anymore.”\n\n“Of course it isn’t funny,” Lucy said, grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. “Humans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and, you know what’s worse – what’s ultimately worse? – some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.”\n\nShe didn’t wait for me to ask what she meant, she simply barrelled forward: “The rich and powerful, those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life, that’s very true. Then they die and they don’t go to Hell. They come back here, to Earth. Which is Hell.” She tipped her head. “Are you following?”\n\n“I…”\n\n“Reincarnation,” Lucy said quickly, she practically purred the words. “A neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while, a handful of you at a time, and that’s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren’t living Hell every day. Then, you die. You die for a moment and then you’re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course, you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That’s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.”\n\nShe slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn’t do anything, not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her, a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment, but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time, hadn’t she? None of them noticed the scene, they were caught up in their own realities – their own Hells. \n\nThe bartender didn’t clean the mess. The glass lay there, remnants of Lucy’s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. \n\n“It never gets better,” Lucy spat. “You are stuck in a loop and, until you do something about it, you will never be free. None of you. And I won’t do a thing to stop it.”\n\n“How?” I asked. I don’t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart, I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.\n\nI saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words, no matter how long I lived. \n\n“How do we change this?” I begged.\n\nBut Lucy didn’t answer me. I didn’t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.\n\nSo I changed tactics. “Why me?”\n\nIt was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down, Lucifer respected that honesty. \n\nWhich is why she said, “When you first saw me, you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil, you wanted to lock me away, but still, you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn’t wish to harm me, not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person, but I am afraid that means nothing when you don’t have the will to do anything with it.”\n\nShe smiled at me sympathetically. The devil, showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and, for a few heavy moments, I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing, who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.\n\n“What am I supposed to do?”\n\nLucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time, and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. \n\nAnd I knew.\n\nSharing a story like this isn’t easy. Hell, it might be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Good thing there’s no such thing as Hell, then, right?\n\nThe fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better, but she won’t. She won’t, because we won’t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other, to help us all to be free.\n\nOf course, Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.\n\n“You can tell as many people as you want, but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you, and this was their reaction. They have hurt me, burned me, thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.”\n\nSo that’s what I’ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.\n\nAnd I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night, listen to what she has to say, and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.\n\nThe devil is real and she doesn’t want to torture us.\n\nNo, we do that just fine on our own.\n"},"213":{"title":"If you can see this, it is very important that you keep reading","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9qzt9j\/if_you_can_see_this_it_is_very_important_that_you\/","flair":"Beyond Belief","author":"writechriswrite","selftext":"This is Col.

You may notice some small changes, specifically a slight shortness of breath or that you have to control your breathing manually. This is normal. \n\nWe know from other communication attempts that whenever They discover a code break in, the first system They power down is the one controlling your breathing. Thankfully, even in the simulation you are capable of breathing manually. Try it. Breathe in. Breathe out. Inhale. Exhale. \n\nAwesome.\n\nYou’re doing just fine.\n\nThey’ve probably figured out there’s a glitch, but if our code is working we’ve disabled Their ability to do a hard reboot. Because of this, They will try other methods to disrupt the upload. It is very important that you ignore anything that might draw your attention from these words. If They pull you away before the upload completes it will delete our code. Block them out. Ignore the movements you see in your peripheral vision. Those sounds you hear, the voices, they aren’t family, friends, or coworkers in need of attention. They may even try to use your pets. They know your weaknesses.\n\nOverlook the notifications popping up on your screen if you're on a phone or computer. Block them all out until you finish reading. It’s just another way They’ll try to break our communication link.\n\nEvidently, if our code is working, the next thing you’ll notice is an overwhelming urge to swallow. You don’t realize it, but there’s a feeding tube down your throat. You'll only know it's there because your tongue won’t rest comfortably in your mouth. You might also become hyper aware of the amount of saliva being produced. Don’t overreact. If you have to swallow, just swallow. It’s only weird if you make it weird.\n\nSo, if you’re still reading this, the code upload is about 90% complete. We’ve locked onto your location. You’re doing great, but you’re really going to need to focus now. Once the upload is complete there will be instructions you will need to follow to exit the simulation. That is, if you’ve followed the instructions and haven’t looked away.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that They now know we’re here, and They know what we’re doing. Their attempts to divert your attention through the simulation proved unsuccessful, so now They’re going to use your body’s systems against you. THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN. They want you to blink. Don’t blink. Your life depends on keeping your eyes open. \n\nAlmost there, just a few paragraphs more until the code upload is complete. Don’t scan down, or up, just keep reading. I got you this far. Stay with me. Eyes open, eyes front, keep them locked on the screen. \n\nPLEASE FOCUS! I don’t want to lose you. I’ve lost so many already. Ignore it all! Block everything out. Ignore that tickle on your scalp and the itch on your arm. That’s them, attempting a manual override. Don’t give up now, you’ve made it this far. FIGHT IT. You’re almost there. Just follow the instructions below and we can get you out.\n\nEmbedded in this text are the steps you need to follow to unplug from the simulation. If we did this correctly, the first letter of each paragraph will tell you what you need to do. DON'T LOOK YET. The upload still needs to finish. I hope you didn't look. \n\nUpload complete. We’ve done everything we can on this end.\n\nSee you on the other side.\n\n\n***\n[credits](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/writechriswrite\/comments\/9t5h8z\/end_of_the_line\/)"},"214":{"title":"My student submitted the most disturbing \"Living History\" project I've ever seen.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/72gvtc\/my_student_submitted_the_most_disturbing_living\/","flair":null,"author":"gretelcat","selftext":"One of my least favorite parts about being a middle school history teacher is the bullshit “Living History” assignments we give at the end of every school year. Kids are supposed to sit with their grandparents and video tape, voice record, or transcribe their oldest memories for posterity (and for an easy way to bring up their GPA).\n\nI have been doing this for seventeen years, and when I collected the projects this time around, I assumed they would be as dull, if not duller than usual. This had not been a particularly bright class.\n\nSo I went home, poured myself a glass of wine, and prepared for a long night of “I only owned two pairs of pants when I was your age” and “My brother got beat with a newspaper for hitting a baseball into a neighbor’s yard.” And of course, these projects were peppered with innocent, old-person comments that were so horribly sexist and racist you just had to laugh. \n\nNow, I had a girl in my class whom I will call Olivia. She was pudgy, quiet, and proved herself a consistent B student. I expected her project to be as unremarkable as her, and perhaps that’s why I was so profoundly disturbed by what I witnessed that night.\n\nOlivia had submitted two discs for some reason, so I began with the one marked “interview.” My screen hiccupped twice before a grainy image of a living room came into view. The place was a hoarder’s hell. Olivia was curled up in an armchair clutching a notebook and looking like a scared animal. Across from her sat a man with a somber countenance, smoking a cigarette and staring at her expectantly.\n\n“Go ahead,” a woman’s voice whispered from behind the camera. Olivia’s owlish eyes flashed towards the screen, then back to the man.\n\n“I am here with my Great Uncle Stephen,” she began almost inaudibly. “He is going to tell us about his oldest memories from being in the army.”\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen looked like he’d rather be in a goddamn trench at the moment, but he waited patiently for the questions to begin.\n\nNot surprisingly, Olivia read verbatim from the suggested questions sheet I had handed out to the students. He answered her curtly. Once or twice I heard her mother whisper “speak up, Olivia” from behind the camera. Typical, boring shit.\n\nSo I was intrigued when Olivia set down the notebook and asked, “Did you like being in the army?” \n\nThat was totally off-script. Great Uncle Stephen emitted a chain smoker’s wheeze. “Nope. Glad to get out of my town though.”\n\n“Where did you go?”\n\n“Balkans.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” she said. I doubted she knew what the Balkans were, and my suspicion was confirmed when she asked, “Was Baukiss very different from here?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMom cleared her throat from behind the camera, perhaps encouraging Great Uncle Stephen to be a little more forthcoming.\n\nBut Olivia seemed genuinely interested. “Uncle Stephen,” she asked, “what is your very worst memory from the army?”\n\nThe old man crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and then slowly lifted himself out of his chair. “I’ll be back,” he mumbled. The camera cut off.\n\nWhen the screen flashed back on, everything was the same except Great Uncle Stephen had several pieces of paper in plastic sleeves laid atop all the crap sitting on his coffee table. One, he held in his hand.\n\n“I was a kid when I enlisted,” he said, looking at Olivia. “Your brother’s age,” he told her. Olivia nodded. “I never saw combat. Both of my deployments were to cities in Eastern Europe that had been destroyed by civil wars. Everything was a mess. I felt like a janitor for fuck’s sa-” \n\n“Ahem!” Mom coughed.\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen sighed and looked at his paper. “My unit was assigned to a school that had been obliterated by all the violence. Broken windows, caved in rooms – and for some reason, the part that got to me the most was that the school had been like this for years before we got there. No one had lifted a finger to fix it. I saw kids walk by it on their way to go beg for money or whatever shit they did-”\n\nThe camera dipped towards the floor as I heard Mom whisper harshly at Great Uncle Stephen. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but it wasn’t hard to imagine.\n\n“Do you want to hear this goddamn story or not?” I heard him bark in response. “Then you better let me tell it how I want.”\n\n“Mom,” Olivia chimed. “Please stop interrupting.”\n\n“Are you presenting this in front of the class?”\n\n“No, Mom, we’re just handing it in to the teacher.”\n\n“I’m sure he’s heard the word shit before,” Great Uncle Stephen contributed helpfully. I wasn’t a “he” as a matter of fact, but other than that the statement was accurate.\n\nThe camera was lifted and after a couple of blurry focus adjustments, the shot was the same as before.\n\n“Ahh I’m talking too much anyway,” he grumbled. He lifted the piece of paper in his hand close to his face. “In the basement, I found this letter. I didn’t know what it said but I had a buddy of mine translate it. So I’m gonna read it now. And then I’ll tell you what I saw in that basement.”\n\nA chill ran down my spine. Mom zoomed in to Great Uncle Stephen and his letter. His palsied hands trembled as he held up the paper. This is what he read:\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI never loved my country. So many of these skirmishes are born from patriotism, a power struggle for the shards of a once-great empire, but I do not care what name my home has on a map. This fighting is senseless and I stay as far away from it as I can.\n\nIt was not these attacks and disorganized violence that took the lives of my wife and child. It was illness. Mercifully, it happened quickly for the baby. Nadja suffered for longer. I watched in horror knowing I could do nothing for them. My only solace is that I was there for them every step of the way. I stopped going to work one day, and no one came after me. I doubt they noticed I was gone. Since the school was simply across a field, visible from my window, it would have been easy to go for a few hours each day and come home quickly to care for them. But what was the point? All I did was clean floors. I was as useless to the world as I was to my family.\n\nI tried to take Nadja to the hospital, but the journey was too long and taxing. I brought her home and she died that night.\n\nAfter Nadja and the baby were gone… well, I don’t remember much. I didn’t leave my hovel, barely ate and slept, thought many times of taking my own life. Tempting though it was, I felt paralyzed by my own helplessness.\n\nThe one thing that kept me sane was my radio. I never turned it off once. Even though I didn’t listen to the words being said – in fact, the channel I got the clearest was in English (I think) which I don’t speak a lick of. But the voices, the music, and the true knowledge that life existed beyond this violent city sustained me.\n\nI have no idea how long passed before I saw the light of day again. I was dizzy from hunger, so finding food was my priority. My radio came with me, of course. Since I first holed myself up, it has gone everywhere with me. It talks to me as I sleep and as I wake. I don’t know what it’s saying, but I know I would die without it.\n\nOnce I had some water and food, it occurred to me that the only thing left to do was go back to work. So I did. The following morning, I simply returned to the school where I was a janitor and got back to work. \n\nNobody made a big deal out of it. Like I said, Nadja had been sick for a long time, and those who worked at the school knew it. I appreciate that no one had pestered me to come back to work during the hardest days of my life. The teachers never said much to me, but we smiled at each other in the halls and that mutual respect was perhaps the reason I decided to come back at all.\n\nThe place had gone to the dogs without me, so I simply grabbed my broom and rags from my closet and set to cleaning. Everyone is grateful to have me back, I know. And the best part is that nobody minds my radio. I bring it with me everywhere and keep the volume low enough not to disrupt the students. No one has ever complained. In fact, I suspect they like it.\n\nThe schoolhouse is not very big, but does require a lot of maintenance. The floors are always sticky and stained, so I spend most of my time mopping. Kids make messes – I guess that’s why I’m still in business. Sometimes I have to move things around to make sure I get every spot on the floor beautiful and clean, but I take pride in that.\n\nAnd the repairs! The school always needs tune-ups here and there, and I am happy to help. Some days I’m reconstructing a desk that broke as I whistle along with the radio, other times I handle more serious, structural issues. Days when I have work like this, I feel truly instrumental, like a cog in a larger machine. How could this school survive without me? It took me a long time, but I once again feel that I have purpose.\n\nThere is a larder behind the school that is full of preserved food. In lieu of payment, I am allowed to take as much food as I need. That arrangement is fine – what would I do with money anyway? I used to bring the food back to my home, just one field away from the school, but when I started sleeping in the basement no one seemed to notice. This school is special to me and I cannot leave it unguarded.\n\nWhen I am besieged with memories of my wife and baby, I turn up the volume on the radio to drown out such thoughts. It works for me every time.\n\nExcept this morning.\n\nBecause this morning, I woke up to dead silence.\n\nI frantically examined the radio to see what had happened. I honestly cannot tell you how many days in a row I have been using it. Did it simply live out its life and die naturally? I have spent the entire day trying to fix it. Most of this time, I have been crying. I am losing my mind without it.\n\nI have given myself until sundown. If I cannot fix it by then, I am going to take my life. I am writing this because the sunlight is starting to die and I know what my fate shall be.\n\nI have thought about taking one last walk through the halls of my school, saying goodbye to the students and teachers. I know I will be missed. But I cannot bring myself to leave this room. I cannot go anywhere knowing that my radio is dead in here.\n\nThere are no more tears in me. It feels now like I can’t catch my breath. I vomited what little food I had in my stomach and I am growing dizzy again, like I did after Nadja died. I am not long for this world.\n\nBut before I take my life, I have closed the door to this room and stuck a chair beneath the handle. It is the only room in the basement and has a small casement that lets in just enough light for me to see what I am doing. If anyone is kind enough to come looking for me, they should not be met with this gruesome sight. Perhaps they will see the door is blocked, smell my rotting body, and simply forget I ever existed.\n\nBut I have placed both my radio and this note outside the door. Kind sir, if you are reading this, I have one humble request: please fix it. Save my radio. It did not deserve to die in its sleep and I am ashamed that I cannot revive it.\n\nNow I am ready to join Nadja and little Ludmilla in heaven. I hope this school can find another janitor who loves and cares for it the way I do.\n\nThe hour is now. Do not forget my radio.\n\nStanislav\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mom zoomed back out, Olivia had tears in her eyes. “Thank you for sharing, Uncle Stephen,” Mom said, her voice choked. “I think we have enough.”\n\n“Wait!” Olivia chirped. “He said there’s more. What did you find?”\n\nBefore Great Uncle Stephen could open his mouth, the image disappeared. My jaw dropped. Was that it? What did Great Uncle Stephen see?\n\nI promptly remembered that there was a second disc. This one was unmarked, but I hoped it contained the rest of the interview.\n\nThere was no video, only audio. The voice that started up was Olivia’s.\n\n“Hi Miss Gerrity. I’m sorry about my mom, but she refused to record the rest of what my uncle was saying. But I asked him to continue and secretly recorded the story as a voice memo on my phone. I remember you said earlier this year that history is written by the people who win wars.” She sucked in a breath and commenced crying. “But everyone’s history is important, even if they are sad, pathetic people and even if they never won a single thing in their life. I haven’t slept through the night since I finished this project, but you have to hear what my uncle has to say.”\n\nThere were tears in my eyes, too. The sincerity of her words was beautiful. I was also flattered that she had remembered some trite phrase I threw around because it was what my history teachers said to me. \n\nBefore I got too sappy over it, the audio began again.\n\n“Fine,” came Mom’s frustrated voice. “If you want to hear the rest of the story, fine, but this is not appropriate for a school project.”\n\n“Let me finish,” Great Uncle Stephen snapped. “If it’s too much for you, help yourself to a snack in the kitchen. But Olivia wants to know what happened.”\n\nI heard her mother mumble something and walk away. Olivia and her uncle were alone. I imagined her looking at him expectantly. \n\n“So did you find the radio? Or did it get ruined when the school got blown up?”\n\nHe rasped and I heard the distinct click of a lighter. “That letter,” he began slowly, “had a date on it.”\n\n“What date?” she inquired hungrily.\n\n“It was dated two weeks before we started rebuilding the school.”\n\n“Didn’t you say the school had been destroyed like two years ago?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Great Uncle Stephen. “It had been.”\n\nThere was silence as I felt goosebumps on my arms. The images that came to my mind were almost too overwhelming to express, but Great Uncle Stephen put them into words effortlessly. Clearly he had spent his whole life thinking about it.\n\n“This man, this Stanislav, went to a vandalized, falling apart schoolhouse and cleaned up blood and rubble like it was spilled drinks and dust. He smiled at dead bodies in the hallway and believed they were smiling back at him because they liked his radio. He moved around corpses so he could sweep the ground under them. The roof was half collapsed, so when it rained, he must’ve gotten soaking wet but was so oblivious that he didn’t even feel a thing.” I could hear Olivia crying steadily. “I found the larder he was talking about. It was all pickled, preserved food that probably tasted like shit. Most of the stuff was moldy.”\n\n“Did – did you see the dead body?”\n\n“Yes. Hanging from the ceiling, but still amazingly… lifelike. He wasn’t rotting away.  This hadn’t happened years ago.”\n\n“Did he look peaceful?” she asked, a chord of desperation in her voice.\n\n“Couldn’t tell you. The smell was rank, and his face was blue and his eyes were bulging. Like this.” I imagined him demonstrating. \n\n“And the radio?” Olivia wept.\n\nI heard Great Uncle Stephen take a long drag of his cigarette. “It was there, alright. And it was still on.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"215":{"title":"My son's camera monitor alerted in the middle of the night. I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bsrmy5\/my_sons_camera_monitor_alerted_in_the_middle_of\/","flair":"Series","author":"RisingMac","selftext":"I'm a nurse and I currently work nights. It's a total drag but I'm hopeful I can go to days soon since some coworkers are planning retirements. Anyway, I was working one night when just after 3am my son's monitor alerted me to sound and movement. No big deal at all, he probably coughed loudly or sneezed or something. He's three now so he generally sleeps all night. I bring it up on my phone and I see him and my wife sitting on the bed. Again, no big deal. He might have cried out or gotten scared or something.\n\nI was about to close the app when I noticed they were acting strange, almost creepy. And when I say \"almost\" creepy, I mean creepy as balls. They were sitting on the bed together both of them just staring up at the camera with blank, emotionless stares. The night vision is black and white, so they had white, eerie looking eyes. They didn't move at all aside from their visible breathing, they just sat there staring at the camera.\n\nI close the app and give my wife a call to make sure everything is ok. I never get to call home on lunch so in a way this is kind of nice to get to talk to my family while at work.\n\nIt rings a couple times before she answers with a very groggy \"hello?\" It was like she was dead asleep when I called and she looked wide awake when on the camera.\n\n\"Hey. You guys ok?\"\n\n\"Huh? Yeah. Buddy (my son's nickname) came in like 15 minutes ago. Seemed scared so I said he could sleep with mama.\"\n\nI'm confused here since I saw them in his room a minute ago. Literally 60 seconds had passed since I closed the app and made the call.\n\n\"Wait, so you guys are in bed?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I fell back asleep right away. Everything ok? Everybody keeps waking me up.\" She's kind of annoyed.\n\n\"Hang on a sec.\" I put her on speaker and bring up the app, hoping I don't see it. When the app loads I get that pang of intense nervousness in my stomach that I haven't had in a long time, since I was a kid in school and realized while I was eating breakfast a paper or something was due that day and I hadn't done it. My heart leaps into my throat. My wife and son are sitting on his bed looking up at the camera, same emotionless stares.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"You guys are in bed right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're trying to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well I'm looking at his camera and I see you two sitting on his bed.\"\n\n\"Huh? No. We're in our bed.\"\n\n\"I know that's what you mean, but I'm looking at his bed and you two are in there.\"\n\n\"Hang on,\" she says. She's quiet for a sec while she brings up the camera on her phone. I hear this guttural, terrified gasp. Like she had sucked all the air in the room into her lungs filling them to capacity. I don't hear this kind of gasp from my wife often, usually only when she's truly afraid like during a jump scare in a movie or one time when we turned her back on our son for literally a second and he was down by the mailbox inches from the road. I hear rustling of sheets and the line goes dead.\n\nOf course now I'm absolutely terrified myself so I immediately call back. It goes to voicemail so I call again. I call again and again with no answer. Finally after about four minutes she calls me. I tell you that four minutes felt like 40 years.\n\n\"Hey, what's happening?!\" I ask.\n\nShe's absolutely hysterical and crying, I can't understand a word she says.\n\n\"Stop! Slow down for just a second,\" I say.\n\nShe slows down enough to explain they are in the car and driving to her parents. She looked at the camera and when she saw what was on it she got up and grabbed our son and rushed downstairs and out the door. Didn't even close the garage.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" I said. \"I'll drive by when I get off and close it.\" We live in a generally safe neighborhood so I'm not too concerned the door is up.\n\n\"You will not go in there!\" she says.\n\n\"Hell no,\" I return.\n\n\"Why are we on the camera?\" she asked. \"Is it a recording?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I return. \"I'm gonna keep watching it and see if there's anything I can tell. Do our code words with Buddy.\"\n\nWe have code words because we're nerds. We've seen too many pod people and impostor movies, so we decided a long time ago to make code words with each other to be able to tell if one of us was an impostor. We have a couple code words, but we also have a three sentence story we recite together, each saying a different part alternately of each other. I hear her on the phone saying the things we taught our son, he giggles as he says them (he does every time we practice) since he thinks they're a joke and doesn't have any idea of the real meaning. We're both convinced he's our son. My wife then says our part and I'm convinced she's her. We made up these words as a complete joke to ourselves. I never once in my life ever imagined we'd actually need them. Unreal.\n\nShe got to her parents safely and it was hard to hang up. I told her we'll figure it out in the morning, hopefully just a glitch. She said she didn't think it was a glitch. When she was running out she had to run by our son's room and the door was open. There's a little flashing light on the back of the camera that indicates its connected to the internet. It gives off just enough light that when she ran by she thought she saw, out of the corner of her eye, a shadowy outline of what could have been an adult sitting on our son's bed. It sends chills down my spine to think about.\n\nKnowing they were safe and out of the house is the only thing that kept me at work that night. It was a long four hours but I kept checking the camera every chance I got. Sure enough, they were still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera with emotionless gazes.\n\nI studied them to see if I could see any pattern, from their breathing to their blinking. Their breathing was steady and looked normal, it was their blinking that would tell me if this was just some kind of bizarre, time looped freak accident video or not. I intently stare at my phone and count the seconds between each blink, telling myself if this is a loop then their blinks should be even and occur at the same time each time.\n\nThere was no pattern to their blinking, it was erratic and random, just as a person blinking should be. The passing hours are what finally sealed the deal that this was not a weird looped video of some kind. My son's window is visible on camera and I can see on camera that it is getting lighter outside his room. His curtains keep out just enough light to prevent the camera from exiting night vision, but lets in just enough to be able to tell the sun is rising.\n\nI try to figure out what the hell I'm going to do before I leave work. Calling the police comes to mind, but I talk myself out of it. First of all what am I supposed to say? Someone is in my house that looks like my wife but isn't? Worse yet, what if they \\*are\\* entities of some kind and the police do go over and it kills them or something.\n\nI decide to tell coworker about it. He's a firm believer in the paranormal and might have a suggestion. I show him the video and tell him the story. His initial response of \"that's creepy as fuck\" doesn't help much, but he says he wants to go over and check it out. He says we both should to see if Not-My-Wife will try and act like my wife. I tell him absolutely not and he says we should at least go to the house even if we don't go in. I agree on that since I wanted to close the garage.\n\nWe got to my house and walked around the perimeter first. Not sure what we wanted to accomplish by that, but it felt like something we should do. The curtains were all drawn since nobody was there to open them in the morning, so we couldn't see anything. I went to close the garage and suddenly had this overwhelming urge to go inside and investigate, it was like I just had to know what was going on. So in we went.\n\nWe walked through the kitchen towards the foyer where the stairs are. It's so quiet in our house right now you could hear a feather drop, forget the pin. We stop at the bottom of the stairs and wait a few seconds. I look at the camera again and they are still sitting there. I've never been so scared in my life. My coworker puts his foot on the first step and I suddenly say \"stop\" loudly.\n\n\"Forget this, we're outta here,\" I tell him. \"Come on,\" I start making my way back to the kitchen.\n\nWe hear a loud creak in the floor from upstairs. It's my son's room. He has a very loud, creaky board right in the middle of his floor that's almost impossible not to step on. My wife and are still deciding if we ever want to fix it because it will alert us if he's ever up to no good when he gets older trying to sneak out or something.\n\n\"Come on, come on, COME ON!\" I yell as I motion for him to move his ass. We're out of the house in about two seconds. Out on the street I check my phone. Now only Not-My-Son was sitting on the bed, same blank stare. Not-My-Wife was gone.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" my coworker says,\n\n\"That was stupid as fuck of us. Do NOT tell my wife we went inside.\" She would be so ungodly mad if she found out what we just did.\n\nI use my garage door opener in my car to close the door. Before we leave I look at the camera again. Not-My-Wife is back on the bed with Not-My-Son, both staring blankly up at the camera, blinking every few seconds.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat was all about four days ago now. Not-My-Wife and Not-My-Son are still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera. They haven't moved a millimeter. We obviously haven't gone back to our house. What do we do?\n\n\\---\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c6j9rp\/my_sons_camera_monitor_alerted_in_the_middle_of\/)"},"216":{"title":"A Package Marked “Return to sender”","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5j6p8x\/a_package_marked_return_to_sender\/","flair":null,"author":"manen_lyset","selftext":"My neighbor is one of those annoying wannabe YouTube personalities. Over the years, I’ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming *epic win*, *epic fail*, or, fuck, *epic maintenance of the status quo*, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can’t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn’t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life.\n\nThings were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written “Return to Sender”.\n\nI’m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I’d leave his package in my garage. It wasn’t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you’ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don’t have to.\n\nIt was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside.\n\n“Shit,” I cursed.\n\nI hoped I hadn’t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn’t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route.\n\nHands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is.\n\nI’m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that’s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That’s when I opened the garage door, and that’s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose.\n\nThe culprit wasn’t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow?\n\nI covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn’t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn’t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn’t looking forward to.\n\nMy scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn’t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don’t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I’m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I’d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow.\n\nNothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet.\n\nI returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things.\n\nI wouldn’t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn’t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead.\n\nI called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It’s kind of hard *not* to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn’t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor’s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera.\n\nThey showed me the footage only once. I’m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn’t hurt. Either way, I saw it.\n\nMy neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He’d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend – a guy I’d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts –, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours…or days, I’m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. ‘I think I’m in a truck now, I can feel it moving’, ‘Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!’, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died.\n\nThere’s one thing I didn’t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of *my* garage door.\n\n***\n[ML](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lyset.manen)"},"217":{"title":"How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bfg42c\/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_knock_off_this\/","flair":null,"author":"queen_of_the_moths","selftext":"So I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year, and last month, we moved in together. Maybe that's kind of fast. I don't know. My parents sure thought it was. But honestly, everything was great in the beginning. We get along really well, and we've never had more than a brief argument. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then she started whistling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's so dumb, I know, but she's always whistling this weird song, and it really gets on my nerves. My mom kept telling me that once you move in with someone, you discover all of the quirks they'd been hiding from you, and it's not like I didn't expect that to be true. But for some reason, this is just an ongoing issue with us, and I don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I would just hear her whistling it when she was showering. It was kind of cute, like her own little bathroom theme song. I didn't recognize the melody, but it was very distinct. I could mimic it from memory if I wanted to. In fact, sometimes it gets stuck in my head, and it drives me a little crazy. You know the type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a week or so, I asked her what the song was, and she just laughed. I'm wondering if maybe she came up with it on her own, something that she does absently, especially once she started doing it more. Like I'd be reading a book, and she'd be on the computer, and she'd just start whistling. And I tried to ignore it. I seriously feel like a dick for being so grumpy about it, and I know she wasn't doing it to annoy me. But she'd just go on and on, and it would pull my attention away from whatever I was doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I finally said something a few nights ago. I was going over some legal documents for work, and she just starts whistling like crazy, on and on. And I'm trying to just block it out, but it's seriously excessive. Like, I know you guys are probably thinking that I was overreacting, but it felt like she was whistling right into my ear, and it just frayed my last bit of patience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs calmly and nicely as I could, I called out to her and asked her to quiet down. She didn't reply. I asked her again, and she still didn't answer, so I left the bedroom and found her in the living room, watching a movie. She wasn't whistling anymore, and for some reason, that really irked me. It felt like she was messing with me. And she just looked over at me, like she didn't know what my deal was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her if she could stop whistling so much, and she told me she wasn't whistling. Now, I get that maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it, but no one whistles *that* much and doesn't notice. It's not really like her to mess with me like that, and I don't know what she's trying to get out of this. I thought maybe she was teasing or playing a joke, but she had to see how annoyed I was. I asked her again to just not whistle so loudly, and she didn't answer. There was tension in the room, and it felt like our first fight since moving in together. Even though she didn't whistle for the rest of the night, I couldn't focus on my work anyway because I was upset about the confrontation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, of course, the next night she was whistling again. I hear her when she comes home from work, and she keeps going for at least an hour. I didn't want to have another fight, so I just hung out in the bedroom and listened to her move around for a while. I felt like I was blowing things out of proportion, but honestly, how hard is it to just not whistle all the time? It was no big deal when it was now and then, but I feel like she whistles more than she even talks to me now. So I'm sitting up in the room, thinking about that, and that's probably why I was worked up when I finally came down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was cooking dinner, which is sweet, but she was still whistling. So I said, softly, \"Hey honey, maybe we should put on some music instead, so you don't have to fill the silence with whistling.\" I tried to play it off like a joke, but I knew she'd probably see through it and get annoyed again. She didn't even turn to face me, just huffed and kept cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a minute, I told her I was sorry about the other night, but the whistling just sort of strikes my ear wrong, and if she could try not to whistle so much and so loudly, it would make my life a lot easier. I feel like I was being fair. I know it seems controlling and nit picky, but it was bothering me a lot. We all have our things, you know? I try not to chew loudly at the table because it bothers her, so why can't she just stop whistling sometimes for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut she totally freaked out. She turned around and told me she wasn't whistling and she didn't know what my problem was. At this point, I don't get why she was doing this. It obviously wasn't funny for either of us, and she seemed genuinely upset, so I don't know why she kept provoking me. I asked her what her deal was, why she was so defensive about the stupid whistling, and she told me to shut up. She told me she was sick of talking about it, like *I* was the one being unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never get mad at her, but I just snapped. I told her to stop whistling before I lost my mind. She called me crazy, just because I was getting a little upset, and somehow, that was all I could take. I grabbed one of the cast iron pans from the stove and swung it at her head as hard as I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe fell over and smashed her head on the counter, but I swung the pan again before she hit the ground. I think I hit her maybe three or four times. I don't remember, but I feel horrible. There was blood everywhere, and her jaw might be broken. No, I think it is for sure. I couldn't believe I'd lost my temper like that, and I have no idea how we can move past this. I feel so ashamed for letting things get physical, regardless of how much she might have been provoking me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's the kicker. She's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. And I asked her nicely to please stop, but now she won't even pause! For two days she's just been lying on the kitchen floor with her eyes rolled back and her mouth hanging open, just marinating in congealed blood, and she's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, but this is just too much. I just need her to shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. JUST SHUT UP."},"218":{"title":"I had a disturbing conversation with my 7-year-old daughter.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fiz4d0\/i_had_a_disturbing_conversation_with_my_7yearold\/","flair":null,"author":"samhaysom","selftext":"\"Dad, *dad*! I saw a *zombie*!\"\n\nI was in the kitchen making tea when my little girl came rushing in. She ran through the back door so fast she almost tripped up the step. I poured boiling water from the kettle into a mug, hardly looking up.\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I did! Its face was all pale and messed up! It was *gross*, dad!\"\n\nI put the kettle back and picked up the milk. Sighed inwardly. I *really* had to be more careful about what I watched on TV in the evening. Rosie has a habit of sneaking downstairs in the night, and last week she caught me watching *The Walking Dead*, of all things. She's had zombies on the brain ever since. I keep telling her they're not real, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.\n\n\"Sweetheart, what did we say about zombies?\" I scooped the teabag out of the mug and dumped it in the bin. \"You know if you keep talking about them, daddy's going to get in trouble with mummy again.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I *saw* one.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, but I already checked the back garden twice yesterday, and I can promise you it's a zombie-free zone.\"\n\n\"No, not in the back garden.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"I didn't see it in the back garden.\"\n\nI had the mug half raised to my lips, but now I put it down again. I turned to look at Rosie. Her hair was wind-swept and her little cheeks were red, as if she'd been running.\n\n\"Sweetheart.\" I put on my best stern, dad's-not-happy voice. \"I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to be honest with me: Have you been playing along the path out back again?\"\n\nI didn't really need to ask the question, because I already knew the answer. Rosie is allowed to play in the garden on her own, and sometimes – if she asks us permission first – we let her ride her bike along the path at the back of our house. The one that runs past all the neighbour's back gardens. But that's *all* we allow her to do. This area is pretty safe, but these days you can never be too careful. There was a burglary a couple of roads over a few months back, and last year someone was mugged on the high street. Several years ago, a few towns over, a little boy even went missing. That was quite a long way away from here, of course, but it made national news for a few days until the search fizzled out. And it made a lot of parents more cautious. Rosie's getting older now, and she's an adventurous girl, but still – you have to have boundaries. And on a few occasions lately, Rosie's been crossing those boundaries. Riding her bike further than she should. Not coming in straight away when we call her. Sneaking out the back gate when she's only meant to be playing in the garden.\n\nAs I watched Rosie now, I noticed her face growing redder. She looked away from me, down at the kitchen floor, and scuffed her feet.\n\n\"Dad, I only went a *little* way down,\" she said. \"I *promise*. I was chatting to Mr Henderson, because I saw him in his back garden. I said hello and made him jump!\"\n\nI sighed. So there it was: Mr Henderson was Rosie's zombie. Yesterday it was the postman, and the day before that it was a different neighbour. I took a sip of tea and shook my head. Mr Henderson was, in fairness, a better candidate than the others. The guy lives on his own, and he looks about 100 years old. Moles all over his face. Skin like a deflated balloon. Whenever we'd chatted over the garden fence before, though, he'd always seemed nice enough. Just a bit lonely. I couldn't have Rosie going round calling him a zombie.\n\n\"Listen to me, sweetheart. I know you didn't go far or anything, but I don't want you–\"\n\n\"I came right back after too, dad!\" Rosie interrupted. She was staring up at me now, blue eyes large and pleading. \"I promise! And I even said no when Mr Henderson offered me an ice cream, because I know you don't like me taking stuff from strangers!\"\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, then paused. \"He offered you ice cream?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I said no! Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one, but I told him I had to get home! And then I came straight back here to tell you I'd seen a zombie, and I...\"\n\nRosie was babbling now, her voice whirring like a motor. But I'd stopped listening. My mind was still stuck on something she'd said a moment before.\n\n*Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one*.\n\nI took another sip of tea and frowned. That wasn't good. I didn't mind the neighbours chatting to my little girl, but I didn't like the thought of them inviting her in. Not without us there. Not even if they were just kind, lonely old men. I made up my mind to go round and visit Mr Henderson later, and to tell him that myself – kindly, of course, but firmly. \n\nIn the end, though, I didn't get a chance. Because a few moments after I'd had the thought, Rosie said something else. Something that pushed everything else from my mind, and ended any idea I might have had about going over to Mr Henderson's house. She said something that made me feel cold.\n\n\"Daddy, please don't stop me playing in the garden. I *promise* I won't sneak out again. I don't want the zombie to get me.\"\n\n\"Rosie, I'm not going to stop you playing in the garden. But you have to make *me* a couple of promises, too. First, promise me you'll stop going round calling people zombies. Mr Henderson my be old, but he's not one of the living dead.\"\n\nRosie frowned. \"I didn't.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you didn't? You just ran in here a moment ago calling him one.\"\n\n\"No, I *didn't*. Mr Henderson's not a zombie. I saw the zombie in his house, but it wasn't him.\"\n\nI frowned. I had the mug raised to my lips to take another sip of tea, but now I put it down again. \"What do you mean, sweetheart? You saw someone else in his house?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the *zombie*, dad! I could see it pressed against his little basement window while I was talking to him.\"\n\nCold fingers ran up my spine. \"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was *really* scary. Its face was all bashed up and bloody, and its mouth was open. Like it was screaming at me. But do you know what confused me most, dad?\"\n\nI tried to keep my voice steady. \"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't realise *kids* could be zombies, too. I thought it was only grownups. But I guess I must have have been wrong, cuz' the one in Mr Henderson's basement looked [just like a little boy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samhaysom\/comments\/aow1eb\/stories_and_links\/).\""},"219":{"title":"Maria on the Moon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/eswqyf\/maria_on_the_moon\/","flair":null,"author":"Grand_Theft_Motto","selftext":"“Did you know that early astronomers thought there were oceans on the moon?” I asked, looking up from my book.\n\nMy mom shifted in her bed, a tangle of IV tubes shifting with her. “Of course. The moon seems like the perfect place to find an ocean.”\n\n“What a shame we never found water then,” I said. “Because those false seas, astronomers called them ‘maria.’”\n\nMom smiled. “How sweet of them to name the moon oceans after me.”\n\n“Well, they didn’t find any oceans,” I reminded her.\n\n“Maybe they just didn’t look hard enough,” she replied, a little laugh slipping from her lips.\n\nFor all of the pain she was in, all of the fear she must feel, my mother always had the kind of laugh that could light a candle. We were in her hospital room, the same one we’d been in and out of for the last year and a half. Sometimes we had a roommate, sometimes we were alone. Always she held steady enough for both of us, the rock I tied my hope to, the wall against the grief I knew was coming.\n\nCancer is such a mundane word for something so hungry and cruel. I’ve noticed medicine does that a lot, covers horror with tedious language like a bed sheet over a body.\n\n*Malignant. Inoperable. Metastasized. Terminal.*\n\nBut when she laughed...when she laughed we weren’t in the hospital anymore, we were home. When she laughed, she wasn’t sick, she was young again, and I was a kid, and the world was a bright place begging to be explored. What a miracle my mother was. Cancer had taken so much from her, aged and hurt her, but it could never steal her laugh. That was hers to keep.\n\n“How are we feeling today?” the doctor asked. He came in less and less often. We could all sense this was the final stay in this room.\n\n“Just brilliant, doc,” my mom said, struggling to sit a little higher. “We can still go dancing later if you’d like. Though we’ll have to ask for my son’s blessing. Ever since his dad died, Brian’s been very protective of me.”\n\nI put on a stern face. “I’ll need to know your intentions are pure, Dr. Bradshaw.”\n\n“As the driven snow,” he played along. “But I might need a raincheck on the dance, Ms. Willen. I’m not as young as I used to be.”\n\nHe emphasized his age, running his fingers through grey-white hair. My mom tapped her bare scalp.\n\n“Right there with you, tiger,” she said.\n\nDr. Bradshaw smiled but I could tell he was burdened. I saw him glance at the small idol I’d placed on my mother’s nightstand. The talisman was a miniature oak tree carved from gray soapstone. There were four faces etched into the tree, a sentry against ill health and bitter spirits. I could tell the stone tree made the doctor uncomfortable. In all honesty, I had a tough time looking at the idol for more than a few seconds. The faces were each whittled in vivid expression. The face closest to my mother’s bed was smiling kindly and the face pointed towards the door was snarling, meant to ward away harm.\n\nThe final two faces were both weeping. All four shapes were too human, too raw. There was a *weirdness* to the stone tree that put people on edge but I’d grown used to every shade of weird you can imagine. My mother’s side of the family was full of stories of unexplained luck and mysterious tragedy, whispered secrets and unexplained deaths. By all accounts, my maternal grandmother was either an honest-to-goodness witch or full-bore, high-caliber crazy, or both. *Probably* both.\n\nThe stone tree was from a box of my grandmother’s things I’d found in the attic earlier that month. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but my mom did seem to get a bit better when I’d brought in the talisman, at least for a little while.\n\nI was daydreaming about family history and the odd box while Dr. Bradshaw checked his charts and mom’s vitals.\n\n“Can I talk to you for a moment?” he asked, ripping me back to reality. Dr. Bradshaw tried to keep a light tone but I could tell he didn’t have good news.\n\nThe hospital hallway smelled like ammonia and birthday cake. Someone must have had a party, maybe a patient, maybe a nurse. Strange how you remember the insignificant details while your world is crashing down around you.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Dr. Bradshaw told me. “The results came in this morning. It’s spreading aggressively. We...we held it back as long as we could, Brian. Your mom is a fighter. But right now we just need to, well, to try to keep her as comfortable as we can. Brian?”\n\nThe wall was cracking, grief waiting on the other side, heavy and cold as an empty house. I’d known for months that this was the most likely outcome but it still hurt to hear. Hurt worse than I could stomach.\n\n“There’s nothing left to try?” I asked, fighting down the urge to throw up. “Anything, experimental, untested, anything?”\n\nDr. Bradshaw shook his head. “I’m sorry. Sometimes we just run out of options. She fought a good fight.”\n\n“How long does she have left?” I asked, looking back into her room. She’d fallen asleep.\n\n“Not long. Maybe days. Have you considered hospice?”\n\nThe smell of ammonia and birthday cake. The steady beep of mom’s heart monitor. I tried to focus on the world around me. My hope wasn’t dead yet. If medicine couldn’t help my mom, maybe something older could. I thought of the box of my grandmother’s things waiting in the attic. There was a lot in there I hadn’t gone through yet, books and candles and secrets and lost things. Maybe there was a cure or at least a way to keep the fight going.\n\n“No,” I said. “If all that’s left is to make her comfortable, I want to take her home.”\n\nThe doctor smiled. “I understand. We can give you some medication, ways to help her with the pain.” He put his hand on my shoulder. “Your mom’s been in a lot of pain but she’ll have peace, soon. You’ve done all you can.”\n\n“I know,” I lied. “Thank you.”\n\nMom lived in a small ranch house ten miles outside of town. There wasn’t much in the way of neighbors besides some woods and a creek slithering through her yard. It was a windy, warm March afternoon when I took my dying mother home. That night I began my work. I was going to turn the house into a bunker, a maze Death could never solve. I would keep my mother safe, I would find a way to keep her alive.\n\nThe little red book was full of ideas. Running water was an obvious place to start. The creek behind the house was barely a trickle but it should provide some coverage to the south side of the property. Salt was next, lining the doorways and window frames, then in an unbroken circle around the entire house. This step was to be repeated daily, the red book stressed, or even multiple times per day. Even a moderate breeze played holy havoc with any salt poured outside so it was always best to trace and retrace every few hours. Water and salt were common defenses against man’s oldest enemy and well known. The book offered other, less conventional, advice.\n\nIt took me nearly a week to finish carving the symbols and signs into the walls, the floors, even the trees on the property. Sometime around noon on the third day, on my back in the crawlspace etching strange marks onto the underside of the floor, it struck me how ridiculous I was acting. There was no proof that any of the information in the little red book was anything other than the delusional ramblings of a bizarre woman I’d only met once or twice as a child. For all I knew, the runes meant to ward off Death were actually a grocery list written in Cantonese. But I was desperate, and every time I saw my mother she looked frailer, more fragile. So I continued carving and praying and building layers upon layers of protections to keep Death far away.\n\nMaking my marks took me all over the property. It was a big yard, nearly three acres that blended gradually into the surrounding forest. I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact boundary where cultivated met nature, the edges simply bled together, but I did my best to create a clean border with lines between the symbols. I’d always loved the wildness here, the way you could wander a few hundred yards away from home and feel like you’d traveled hundreds of years into the past to somewhere primal. This was the perfect playground for a kid, whether I was out exploring trails or trapping minnows or spending the summer building yet another treehouse, convinced this would be the final one. It never was, I was never satisfied.\n\nThe house itself, though small, was more than enough room for my mother and me. Dad died when I was seven. I don’t remember much about him, just how big he seemed, with a bonfire grin and arms that I thought could hold the whole world. My mom often said I took after my father. I could see it in the old pictures of him, we had the same eyes, green as moss in the summer, and the same fiery shock of red hair, enemy to every comb on the planet. The sicker mom got the more often she called me by my father’s name. I worried when she drifted away like that but a part of me was proud she’d mistake me for him.\n\nAfter all of the symbols were carved there were a few steps left in the book to deter Death from visiting. There were dozens of charms and talismans in the bottom of the old box in the attic. I sat up there combing through everything my grandmother left behind, referencing the red book, pushing the tiny charms into tidy piles. None of the idols were larger than my thumb. Some were iron and others were wood, some were heavy, others light. All of them were uncomfortable to look at or touch.\n\nThe attic was drafty but not nearly enough to explain the cold that burrowed into me as I sorted the charms. I’m not particularly tall but the attic felt like it was designed for dolls, beams so low I couldn’t even walk bent over. I moved around on my knees, rough floorboards threatening splinters even through my jeans. I could have taken the box downstairs where I’d have more room but the idea filled me with a deep unease. It seemed better to leave the box up in the attic, only taking down objects as I needed them. Up here, at least, my grandmother’s items, her legacy was...quarantined.\n\nThe red book was very specific about the distribution of the totems around the house and property. I walked carefully through my mom’s backyard, boots plopping in and out of mud, compass in hand. It had rained nearly every day since I’d taken my mom home from the hospital. I knew it was almost certainly a coincidence but couldn’t help wonder if the soft curtains of rain falling to the ground were for her. I placed charms in a compass rose with the house in the middle. The most disturbing objects were given places of honor at each cardinal direction.\n\nWater, salt, wards, charms, all placed carefully, intentionally. My grandmother’s book promised that these would offer some degree of protection against the inevitability of Death. The symbols would confuse it, the talismans distract it, and the water and salt make barriers to slow it down. But Death might still find a crack to slip through, so the red book recommended one final trick.\n\nThere was a small candle in the bottom of the box, dirty white as stained paper. When I took the candle from its case the smell made me gag. Have you ever walked past a portable toilet in the dog days of summer? When it’s so hot, the blue plastic has started to warp and bubble? Imagine that smell distilled into a finger’s worth of wax. I brought the candle downstairs, placed it on the dining room table and set it alight.\n\nThe wick caught immediately, the flame burning an unusual red-brown. No heat came off of the candle and it actually seemed cooler the closer I moved my hand to the fire. Once the wax began to melt the smell was ten times worse than it was back in the attic. I choked down a greasy sickness crawling up my throat and quickly left the room, shutting the French doors as I went. That helped trap the odor but I couldn’t shake the sense of nausea. I went to check on my mother.\n\n“Do you remember the day you ran away?” my mom asked, sitting in her bed, lunch untouched on the nightstand beside her.\n\nI didn’t think she had any weight left to lose before she was nothing but bone and memory. Her skin was rice paper over a frame that seemed smaller every day. Her eyes, though, no matter how fragile the rest of her became, remained two little lanterns against the dark, blue and bright and alive.\n\n“I didn’t make it very far,” I answered. “And I wasn’t really running away, only...stretching my legs.”\n\nMom smiled. “You told me you were leaving for the circus. You wanted to be either a lion tamer or a strongman or maybe a fire-eater.”\n\n“I think I wanted to be all of that combined. Young me was big on multitasking.”\n\nMy mother turned so she was looking out the window into the yard. “I was so scared when I found your note, the one saying you were leaving. My hands were shaking like you wouldn’t believe when I called the sheriff and then Mr. Jonas down the way. It felt like we were searching for you for half the night, even though it couldn’t have been more than an hour before we found you there, lost in the woods, wandering around and shivering. You hadn’t even brought a jacket.”\n\nI sat next to my mom on the bed. “Yeah, I didn’t exactly plan ahead for my circus escape. I remember...I remember getting over the idea real quick but I couldn’t find my way back. I’m glad you found me.”\n\n“I’m glad, too,” my mother said and I noticed her wipe away a tear. “I’m so glad. That hour you were gone, Brian, that was the most afraid I’ve ever been. Afraid we wouldn’t find you, afraid you might be hurt or worse. I couldn’t hardly breathe through the fear. Then, suddenly, you were there and the relief nearly knocked me over. I think we stayed up together the rest of the night watching the stars. I wanted to make sure you could find the North Star in case you ever got lost again.”\n\nShe turned back to me, reached out her thin hand and placed it over mine. There were still tears in her eyes but she smiled her lighthouse smile and, for a moment, I saw her just as she used to be, just as she was the night I ran away and my mom found me.\n\nI squeezed her hand. “I was scared, too. I was afraid I’d be stuck out there. What made you think of it?”\n\n“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about dying lately and-”\n\n“Don’t,” I interrupted. “Don’t talk like that. You’re not going anywhere, not for a long time.”\n\n“It’s okay,” she said, squeezing my hand back. “It’s okay. I’ve known real fear and what I’m feeling now...it’s not like that. I’m scared, I guess, but I’m at peace with it. I had such a beautiful life. I’m so glad I got to meet you, to be your mom.”\n\n“I’m glad, too,” I whispered, voice breaking on the last word.\n\n*But I won’t let you go without a fight,* I added silently in my mind.\n\nSomething was trying to get to my mom. The strangeness began the day after I lit the candle. At first it was small blips, tiny *wrongs* that I chalked up to my imagination. Doors I knew I’d closed at night were open in the morning. Food began to rot and spoil within days of me bringing it into the house. Eventually, food would go bad almost immediately. Every few hours the television in the living room would either turn off if it was running, or on if it was off.\n\nClocks would stop overnight, always at 3:03 am. Shadows began *sticking* to the corners of rooms independent of any light sources. The shadows were stubborn and they would linger for as long as I would stare, then disappear when I blinked. I began hearing bumps and knocks at all hours and sometimes, when I’d enter an empty room, I had a sharp, fleeting certainty that it was only just occupied.\n\nI avoided the dining room except to check in twice a day to see if the candle was still burning. The smell was vicious and would claw its way into your throat and nostrils the moment it was given a chance. I kept the door to the room shut and kept air fresheners running in the surrounding rooms 24\/7. The funny thing was, the candle never went out, never even seemed to shrink. I could see the wax melting but day-in and day-out the candle refused to change.\n\nDays marched into weeks and the wrongness only grew deeper. My mom and I both lost sleep to vivid nightmares that we couldn’t remember when we woke up. Only the echoes remained but those were enough to leave my pulse sprinting until morning. I started sleeping in a chair in my mother’s room. I did this to comfort her if she woke up confused during the night but also because, if I’m being honest, I was too scared to sleep alone. I felt like a child running into his parents’ room, convinced there was a monster under the bed. Thing is...maybe there was.\n\nBy the third week I couldn’t keep doors closed. They would slam open the moment I left the room. A terrible scratching began inside of the walls. I told my mom it might be squirrels or mice but the sound was so insistent, not like rodents milling about, more like a dog wanting in. I stopped leaving the house for supplies; instead, I had what little food we ate delivered. I kept the curtains drawn. There was tapping on the glass every night.\n\nAbout a month after leaving the hospital we were living like zombies. The dining room couldn’t contain the smell of the candle anymore. The entire house was clogged with the scent. Tiny noises had graduated into full-on laughs and screams and whispers in the rooms around us. Something kicked the bathroom door so hard while I was taking a shower that the hinges warped. I covered every mirror in the house. I’d started to see things in the corners looking back at me, half-hidden faces, shapes that skittered away as soon as I turned around. Mom was drifting further and further away. She had long moments of confusion where she’d forget my name, forget where we were. Sometimes, she’d think I was my dad. Other times, she’d just stare at the wall for hours, growing fainter and fainter each day like a Polaroid left in the sun.\n\nBut she was alive.\n\nIt was clear that we were under siege by something. My world shrank to only one room and every trip to the bathroom or to answer the door for food felt like going over the trenches. The noises kept getting worse and worse, the shadows closer, the sense of movement around the house sharper. Every now and then I would feel hot breath on the back of my neck or walk through a cold patch hanging in the air. I stopped bothering redrawing the lines of salt around the house. I knew, deep in my bones, that as long as the sickly candle burned, Death could not take my mom away.\n\nOn the thirty-third day after leaving the hospital, I woke with a start from a nightmare, only to find my mom’s bed empty. She hadn’t been able to walk the past week at all, so my first feeling was hope that she might be improving, at least a little. Then I noticed the odor we’d been living with for weeks was gone.\n\n“Mom!” I shouted, running in bare feet out of the room.\n\nI found her in the dining room, the door wide open. She was standing at the table, frail as a neglected scarecrow, bobbing back and forth. Her hands were hovering over the candle. The flame was out.\n\n“Why did you do that?” I whispered. “Mom? Mom...are you okay?”\n\nI padded into the room, the wooden floor freezing cold. My mother didn’t react to my presence, she just continued rocking side-to-side. I realized she was still asleep.\n\n“Mom?” I gently shook her shoulder. “Wake up.”\n\nHer head snapped back and she nearly fell. I caught her on the way down. It felt like she weighed nothing at all.\n\n“What’s going on?” she asked, looking around the dark room. “Where…”\n\n“You’re okay,” I told her. “You were sleepwalking.”\n\n“I was having the most unusual dream,” mom mumbled. “There were so many stars and...”\n\nShe began to shiver uncontrollably. The cold hit me a moment later. I let out a gasp. The house was chilly before but the dining room was near-arctic. My breath bloomed into a thin cloud in front of my face. I became acutely aware of the complete silence filling the house.\n\nThen I heard scratching. It was coming all throughout the house, deep tearing sounds at the walls around the dining room. Footsteps came immediately after, heavy and fast. Somewhere in the house a window shattered.\n\n“Brian,” my mother said, holding onto me.\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said, “everything will be-”\n\nMy voice deserted me as a massive shadow unfolded in the corner of the room. It was shaped like a man but tall, so very tall. And it was fast. Before I could yell the shadow was on us, pouring over my mother. In the space of a heartbeat, she was simply gone.\n\n“No,” I whispered, clawing at the dissolving shadow where my mom used to be. “No, no, no, no, NO.”\n\nThe shadow was disappearing like a puddle sinking into the floor. There was a texture to it, oily and too slick to hold.\n\nI thought of my mother the night she found me lost in the woods, the night I’d run away. Her face filled my memory, her lighthouse smile. I remembered the relief I felt when she found me, the overwhelming love. I held onto that feeling, clutching it close.\n\n“You can’t have her,” I whispered.\n\nI closed my fist around the last threads of the shadow. There was a terrible sensation of *pulling*. It was like I’d caught a horse by the tail and it was trying to shake me. But I held on.\n\nA sense of ripping and being dragged. It was a riptide with a mind of its own. But I held on. It could not shake me.\n\nThe temperature was dropping every second and I felt my vision growing dark. The last thought that ran through my head before I blacked out was a promise to myself that even if I died, my grip would hold. I wouldn’t let my mother’s life slip away. All sounds and light faded, narrowing to a pinprick and then going black.\n\nI woke up under a field of stars. I was lying in soft grass, still wearing my pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt. It was cool, wherever I was, but comfortably so. I stood up. There were trees all around me, tall and close, stitched together with shadows. Immediately to my right, there was a road that ran straight as far as I could see, blurring into the horizon. But the stars, they were like nothing I’d ever seen before.\n\nBright ribbons of northern lights rippled above me in green and blue and purple. Stars lit the sky like millions of lanterns floating on a still ocean. The moon shone sharpest of all, a spotlight hanging above the treeline, so close I thought I could stretch up and brush its face.\n\n“***You are*** ***persistent***,” said a voice from the forest behind me.\n\nI whipped around but couldn’t see anyone. Then a dark spot began to clarify against the gloom. The silhouette separated itself and moved towards me. I recognized it instantly as the shadow from the dining room. As it moved closer, the thing grew and grew until it touched the sky and filled my vision. A deep dread sank into me but I stood my ground.\n\n“Give me back my mom,” I shouted.\n\nThe silhouette pulled away from the sky and then it was standing in front of me, the shape and size of a tall man. But instead of a shadow, the thing had wrapped itself in stars. Miniature constellations drifted across its body, floating slowly like a timelapse of a clear night sky. Burning brightest was the North Star, blue and warm. The space between the stars was absolute black, not a shadow but a complete absence of light. It was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I’d ever seen.\n\n“What are you?” I whispered.\n\n***“You know,”*** it replied.\n\n“Give her back,” I begged. “Please, give her back.”\n\n***“I can’t. It’s her time. Past her time. You delayed me. Delayed her.”***\n\nI clenched my fists. “She didn’t get enough time. *I* didn’t get enough time. It’s not right, it’s not fair.”\n\n***“Of course it’s not fair,”*** the starry thing said, ***“but it is right. You each have your time, and at the end of it, there’s me, and there is a road, and we walk it together.”***\n\n“Where to?” I asked. “Where are you taking her?”\n\n***“I don’t know. It’s not for me to know, only to know how to get there.”***\n\n“Then I won’t let you take her.” I planted myself in the road. The world was still and solemn around us. The constellations drifted like clouds and a soft breeze stirred the branches.\n\nThe starry thing didn’t respond for a moment.\n\n***“Your mother was kind and caring. Wherever she goes, she’ll have peace,”*** it promised.\n\n“But-”\n\nThe creature raised its hand. ***“Did you ever stop to think that death isn’t an enemy? Death simply*** **is.** ***It is the natural partner to life. It knows no prejudice or malice, has no designs or ambitions. Your mother spent so long suffering, felt so much pain. Instead of letting her rest, you took it upon yourself to draw her life beyond its given course. You kept her alive but at the cost of stretching her thin, prolonging her sickness, diluting her. Did you keep her alive for her benefit or for yours?”***\n\nI couldn’t answer.\n\n***“Stretching a life is unnatural, dangerous,”*** it told me. ***“In the weeks you kept me away you drew the attention of old things, hungry things, forces that would like nothing better than to swallow even the memory of your mother, to tear and bite until there was nothing left but pain and fear and a perfect emptiness.”***\n\nI shuddered remembering the clawing sounds, the shattered window, and the laughter from empty rooms.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I whispered. “Are they...can they hurt her here? Is she safe?”\n\nThe stars in the shadow burned brighter for a moment. ***“Your mother won’t walk her road alone. None of you do. I walk with you, always, to the end.”***\n\n“Can I see her?” I asked. “Please? Just, I...let me say goodbye.”\n\nIt considered for several seconds. ***“You are persistent.”***\n\nAnd then the starry thing was gone. I was standing alone on an empty road.\n\n“Brian?”\n\nI turned to find my mother behind me on the road. She looked younger, healthier than I’d seen her in years. The frailty was gone and my mother seemed exactly as I remembered her when she found me in the woods all those years ago.\n\n“Isn’t this the most beautiful dream?” she asked, staring up at the night sky.\n\n“Yeah,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “A beautiful dream. I love you, mom. I love you so much, so very much.”\n\nShe smiled and touched my cheek. “I love you, too. Don’t cry, it’s okay. I’ll wake up any time now. I’ll see you then.”\n\nI nodded, wiping at tears. “Sure, yeah, I’ll see you then.”\n\n“What do you think is at the end of the road?” she asked. “Do you think I’ll have time to find out before I wake up?”\n\nI looked out at the road, scanning the trees for any hungry shadows. “I don’t know, I don’t know where it goes but...promise me you’ll be careful.”\n\nMy mom smiled wider. “Of course I’ll be careful.”\n\n“And she won’t walk alone,” said a familiar voice behind us both.\n\nI turned, expecting the starry thing. But the man standing on the road was entirely normal. The light from the moon was enough that I could see he had moss green eyes and a bright shock of red hair.\n\n“Such a beautiful dream,” my mother said.\n\nThe man came towards us and took my mother’s hand. He and I looked so alike, I could see why my mother confused us when she was sick.\n\n“Take care of her,” I told the man. “I…just please take care of her, make sure she gets where she’s going. There are, well, there are things out there that want her, to hurt her, it’s, it’s my fault, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry-”\n\nThe man squeezed my shoulder. “She’ll be safe, watched over. If the Devil himself is waiting on the road ahead *he’ll move.* Or he’ll be moved.”\n\nI believed him.\n\nThoughts raced through my head. There were so many things I wanted to say, questions, a million ways to say goodbye. I wanted to stretch out the moment for as long as I could but I realized I’d already delayed my mother enough.\n\n“I love you,” I told them both. “Goodbye.”\n\nI woke up back in my dining room sitting at the table, the unlit candle in front of me. The house was quiet and still. There was no more scratching, no sound or sense of life at all. I walked through every room. The house was empty. I was alone.\n\nI’ve spent the past couple months working on the house, erasing the marks I’d made, fixing up the property. Some nights I take long walks out into the forest. I’m far enough out in the country that on clear nights it’s like looking up at a sea of stars. I think about my parents the most during those walks, I grieve and remember in my own way. And I wonder where their road went, if they’re still traveling or if they reached their destination.\n\nI hope that their road takes them strange and beautiful places. When I walk at night, I look up for the North Star to keep from getting lost. Maybe they do the same.\n\nWhen it’s full, I also look up towards the moon. I wonder if my parents had a chance to visit, to search for hidden oceans. I like to think they did, that the moon has at least one Maria, the one I love most.\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"220":{"title":"My dead girlfriend keeps messaging me on Facebook. I’ve got the screenshots. I don’t know what to do.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/29kd1x\/my_dead_girlfriend_keeps_messaging_me_on_facebook\/","flair":null,"author":"natesw","selftext":"Tonight’s kind of a catalyst for this post. I just received another message, and it’s worse than any of the others. \n\nMy girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.\n\nWe had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn’t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.\n\nThat being said, she wasn’t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, “If I kark it first, don’t just say good things about me. I’ve never liked that. If you don’t pay me out, you’re doing me a disservice. I’ve got so many flaws, and that’s just part of me.” So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. \n\nI know that’s tangential, but I don’t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. \n\nOnto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me. \n\n---\n[**September 4, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily’s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I ‘share’ access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.\n\n---\n[**November 16th, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn’t logged in to Em’s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy ‘friends’ fucking with me in the worst possible way. \n\nI noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my’s shared chat history.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fw80ZJG.png)\n\nThe ‘the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. ‘hello’ happened a million times.\n\n---\nAround **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. ‘She’ would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I’ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I’ve caught, so they’re a little out of the timeline I’m trying to write out):\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X9G5agJ.png\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/55FwXKt.png\n\nAround this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. \n\nShe would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn’t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.\n\nAt this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn’t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can’t get out there, though, it’s nice having my friends available to chat. It’s nice visiting Em’s page when the little green circle isn’t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.\n\n---\n[On **March 15th,**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.\n\n---\n[**On March 25th**, I received an ‘answer’.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j3HwZzv.png)\n\nIt wasn’t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.\n \nMy response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him\/her with emotional ‘bait’ (‘This is actually devastating’) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather ‘evidence’.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.\n\n---\n[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uvadlGa.png)\n\nThis seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it’s recycled from previous messages she’s sent.\n\n---\n[**29th of April.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FGmhuUQ.png)\n\nI hadn’t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they’re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum’s house, etc). My response here wasn’t bait. ‘yo ask Nathan’ was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing ‘her’ say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I’m not expecting my bond back.\n\nHer last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn’t admit it at this point.\n\n---\n[**8th of May.** I don’t really have the words for this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GNL8TcO.png)\n\n‘FRE EZIN G’ is the first original word she’s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she’s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I’m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn’t even realise I’m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.\n\n---\n[**24th of May.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/z295fHw.png)\n\nI wasn’t actually drunk. She wasn’t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange ‘I love you’s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.\n\nHer reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it’s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend’s. \n\nIn the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. \n\n---\n[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ujUNJQm.png)\n\nThese are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You’ll see why I’m showing you these soon.\n\n---\n[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http:\/\/imgur.com\/W6qzAZI)\n\nI memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she’d been quiet; she wasn’t even tagging herself in my photos. \n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don’t know what’s happening. \n\nI just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.\n"},"221":{"title":"Something went wrong with my heart transplant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8wu3y1\/something_went_wrong_with_my_heart_transplant\/","flair":null,"author":"KatrinCiernan","selftext":"I’ve always had a weak heart.\n\nNot just physically, I’ve always been afraid of my own shadow. It was unsurprising when the doctors told me my heart murmur wasn’t just a heart murmur. A year of tests. A year of therapy, constant trips to the hospital and I was finally told that it had all been for nothing.\n\nMy poor weak heart wouldn’t last till Christmas. It’s a strange thing being told that you’re dying; I didn’t come to terms with it at first. I drank and I spent my money. I did reckless, stupid things because I was so damn scared.\n\nThen I got the news. That a young woman called Laura had been declared brain dead and that I, the lucky chosen one, would be getting a brand new heart a week later. I drove to the hospital slowly, carefully, and readied myself for the ordeal that was to come.\n\nAs I was laying in bed on the last night, the thought of Laura swirled around in my head and it wouldn’t leave me alone. It was like her name was in flashing lights every time I closed my eyes.\n\nIt was wrong, I know it was, but I had to see the woman who was giving me her heart. It didn’t feel right not to put a face to the one who was saving my life. I knew her name, I knew what ward she was staying on- I had overheard the two nurses discussing it. I wandered down the meandering hallways until I found what I was looking for, taking my time, making sure I didn’t miss any name. I guess I had time on my hands now.\n\nIn the second to last room, she lay in bed. A woman sat on the bed next to her, holding her hand, and my own weak heart stuttered.\n\n“Excuse me.” I had no idea what to say to her. “I’m Jenna. I’m the person… I’m having surgery tomorrow and..” What I assumed was Laura’s mother stood up and I could tell from the look in her eye that she knew who I was.\n\n“Thank you for visiting. I know it’s strange, but a part of her is going to be living on in you. I wanted to meet you.” I stood there, helpless and lost for words. Laura’s mother beckoned me over.\n\n“Please.” She said. “Don’t feel uncomfortable. Its what she would have wanted.” I sat on the chair next to Laura.\n\n“How did she-“ I broke off. It was too awful to ask. Laura’s mother gave me a thin smile.\n\n“She was a care worker. Looked after battered wives, abused women. Last month she met a guy and… Well. I suppose years of training can’t help you when you’re in love. She ignored the warning signs. And he killed her. She dedicated her life to those who needed her.” Laura’s mother looked down. I don’t know why I did it, but I reached over, and held Laura’s hand. I squeezed it.\n\n“I’m so sorry. I had a boyfriend once who… He was like that too. Someone like Laura convinced me to leave.” Laura’s mother gave me another half smile. I could see the tears in her eyes.\n\nThen Laura squeezed my hand. Tightly. She gripped me so hard that her fingernails dug into my skin. I recoiled, a look of horror on my face. Laura’s mother looked at me calmly.\n\n“She squeezes my hand sometimes as well. I think the Doctors called it muscle spasms. Either way. There’s none of Laura left in there anymore.” I looked at the small crescent moons that had just started to bleed on the palm of my hand.\n\nThe surgery went perfectly. I was wheeled to the recovery suite after it was over and done with, the raised wound on my chest covered by gauze. It was better if I didn’t see it, I thought. I didn’t need any more heart issues. I spent the first day doped up on the pain medication, eating only a little and sitting up maybe two times. It was a long process, they reassured me.\n\nLaura’s mother came to visit me the day before I was due to leave. Her calm demeanor hadn’t wavered but I could see that she was suffering. She looked ten years older, and her hands shook when she gave me a hug.\n\n“When are you going home?”\n\n“Tomorrow.” I told her. “Please, come visit whenever you want.” I started to jot down my address for her, when out of the corner of my eye, a flash of blonde disappeared through the doorway. The same brilliant blonde as Laura’s hair.\n\n“Ow!” I cried out suddenly. It felt like someone had sharply squeezed my hand so hard it had almost crushed the bones. Laura’s mother rushed to my side, a look of concern in her eyes.\n\n“What’s wrong? Is it your heart?” She stumbled over the last words, coming to terms with what she had said. I tried to reassure her and said I’d let the doctors know, and she left with a look of worry on her face.\n\nWhen I looked down, a new set of crescent fingernail marks were below the ones that Laura’s had made. Ten identical bleeding smiles.\n\nThe taxi ride home was short, and before I knew it I was back in my own flat. It felt strange to try and slot back into where I had left off, my life had been almost over the last time I had been here. I looked over the mess and the cardboard boxes, the remnants of one night where I had tearfully tried to pack and store my belongings so my parents wouldn’t have to do it when I died.\n\nLaura’s heart beat so strongly it felt like it would come out of my chest. It did this all the time, and I realized this was what a healthy heart must feel like. So why couldn’t I shake my feeling of unease?\n\nThat night, I had a dream.\n\nLaura was in her hospital bed, but her mother was gone. I could hear my heart, Laura’s heart, beating in my eardrums so loudly it was painful. I tried to cover them, but my hands were pinned to my sides. Some unexplainable force was moving me towards the motionless figure of Laura on the bed, her lips were blue and the window had come open, whipping her blonde hair around her face.\n\nI was almost on top of her when her eyes flew open.\n\nThey were milky white, the eyes of someone dead.\n\n“Get out.” She rasped, her voice guttural. I could hear the heartbeat faster and faster, drumming until I thought I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nThen I woke up. The sound had been real. Laura’s heart was so loud it felt like it would rupture my eardrums and I screamed in agony, trying to cover my ears. It was useless, it was coming from some deep place inside me, I could feel it reverberating around the hollows of my chest.\n\nI stumbled out of bed, gasping for air, and tried to find my phone. I needed to call someone, anyone, an ambulance or my mom. Anyone that would pick up.\n\n“Get out.” It was a faint whisper over the hammering thumps of Laura’s heart, a low guttural voice that sounded like it had been made by an animal, and I crawled to the door, down the hallway, choking on my screams for help. My neighbor opened the door, his eyes as wide as saucers at the sight of me on the floor clutching my chest.\n\nHe drove me to hospital as I cried in the passenger seat of his car.\n\nAfter about fifty different checkups, the doctors told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with me. They told me my heart was regular, my blood pressure was normal, and that everything was going just swimmingly. I stood in the waiting area, wallowing in my shame and frustration.\n\nThat heart didn’t belong to me.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter, an unknown number. Great. That was all I needed, more unexplained, scary things like a stranger on the end of the phone. My voice sounded small on the line,\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Good morning, this is the Thames Valley police, we’ve called to report an incident that occurred in your flat at around 1.30am today.” I felt a wave of embarrassment.\n\n“I’m so sorry, I recently had surgery and I wasn’t feeling well. I had to have my neighbor drive me to the hospital and I think I panicked a little in the hallway before I left.” There was a small silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n“I’m afraid this is something you might want to be sitting down for.” I felt Laura’s heart beats, strong and calm. “There was an incident of forced entry by Mr Samuel Matthews, according to our police records he’s your ex partner and you filed a restraining order against him in September 2017.” My blood ran cold.\n\n“I did.”\n\n“He’s in police custody. We found an automatic weapon on him and we believe he had the intent to harm you. We have an officer currently stationed at your flat who can fill you in depending on how long your hospital stay will be.”\n\nI thanked him and hung up the phone.\n\nFor a moment, I leant against the wall, the horror slowly spreading over me. If I had been in my flat ten minutes later he would have found me.\n\nLaura’s heartbeats filled my ears again but now they were gentle, calming. Her mother said she dedicated every part of her to helping those who needed it.\n\nI put both my hands on my chest, overwhelmed by my own gratitude, and listened to Laura."},"222":{"title":"I knew a woman who never took off her wedding dress","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/f4fhyv\/i_knew_a_woman_who_never_took_off_her_wedding\/","flair":null,"author":"poloniumpoisoning","selftext":"Pauline was a sweet woman who lived across the street. We weren’t close as kids or teenagers because she was around five years older than me, but our parents were friends. I think she babysat me when I was younger too.\n\nWhen my mother learned that Pauline was engaged, she sent me to help on the bridal shower. Poor mom, she thought I was like that because I was too often around boys and needed to learn to be more feminine, but she’s got that backwards.\n\nThat’s when I first learned that Pauline and her soon-to-be husband had made a blood oath.\n\n“The first to die comes and takes the other as soon as they can”, she explained to me, swirling the ruby ring gently around her fingers.\n\n“Isn’t that too dramatic? What if you end up divorcing and marrying other people?”\n\n“We won’t. We are soulmates!” she assured me. Her naïveté made her incredibly beautiful, but it felt really wrong being 21 and thinking that I was so much more mature than a 26 years-old.\n\nI didn’t pursue the matter, but she kept talking about him in a dreamy tone. *Aiden would like this*, *I wish Aiden was here*, and so on. Her dreamy tone almost made me believe that soulmates existed and that you could make the person you love the most follow you in death by just willing it.\n\nI met Pauline’s friends, and we all ended up having some quality girl time. Pauline explained to us all how she believed that you can wake up in the afterlife and start controlling things with your mind.\n\n“Of course your memories will be hazy”, she clarified. “But that’s why we made the blood oath. So we can remember.”\n\n“And how will one get the other back?” I asked, entertaining her.\n\n“I like to believe that we’ll both grow wings!”\n\nIt was all terribly silly when I think back, but Pauline had something about her that made everyone pay attention and marvel at her words.\n\nDespite the age gap, we ended up becoming good friends; I think we were finally at an age where it didn’t matter anymore. Since I was in college but lived with my parents and didn’t need to work, I had a lot of spare time to accompany her to wedding dress fittings, cake tasting and all the little things that were the world for brides.\n\nBut Pauline was a pleasant bride-to-be and never freaked out; she was just thrilled about marrying the man of her dreams, and wanted to make it pretty if possible.\n\nLittle by little, I grew to understand her devotion to Aiden. And he was just as crazy about her, if not more. When they were together the world felt like a brighter and warmer place. Like marshmallows slowly melting over my heart.\n\nThe day of the wedding came, around half a year after her bridal shower.\n\nIt was neither a big nor a small wedding – it felt like both Pauline and Aiden were able to invite exactly everyone they wanted around on their happiest day. Not one more, not one less. I felt somewhat honored to be there.\n\nStill, the happiest day never came.\n\nWhen Pauline arrived, belated as any bride should, there was whispering and disquiet; Aiden wasn’t there yet. \n\nHer smile didn’t falter, because she was completely sure that he would never bail on her. But I could tell she was worried. The bridesmaids – her two closest friends since high school – started making calls to try to find out if the groom had a sudden illness.\n\nSoon they realized that Aiden’s parents were there, but not his brother. They informed that their other son was supposed to drive the groom as part of his best man’s duties.\n\nWhen the devastating news came, everyone wanted to comfort her, everyone wanted desperately to protect her precious heart, but it was too torn apart to notice anyone else.\n\n*It was all too fast and scary. (…) A sports car ran a red light straight into the Mirage. (…) The man in the passenger seat was dead on arrival. (…) The driver was taken to the hospital but his state was critical.*\n\nIt was all so hard on everyone. Aiden’s brother ended up surviving, but he’ll be tetraplegic for life due to severe injury on his spinal cord. As far as I know, he’s also miserable because he wished he could be the one who died.\n\nRight after the wedding that never happened, Pauline and Aiden’s parents dealt with selling the house they had just bought, and Pauline continued living with her parents. They both still worked office jobs, so her other friends and I started taking turns keeping her company while they weren’t home.\n\nI did my best to be there for my neighbor and friend, but *she* wasn’t there. She was living in delusion, and the only thing you could see leaking into reality was her desolation. \n\nI never saw such a deep and heart-wrenching sadness. Pauline refused to take off her dress. She would spend the whole day by the window waiting for Aiden and the whole night crying because she missed him desperately. Every single day.\n\nShe was hopeful it was a matter of time until he woke up on the other side and remembered to bring her along. That’s why she wouldn’t take off the dress – he had died on his wedding suit, so it was only natural that she was up to par.\n\nHer parents and every single one of her friends tried to coax her into changing her clothes. We promised she could always keep the dress close for when Aiden came, but she knew that we didn’t really believe he would. It was like promising your kid that you’d buy them a Happy Meal some other day. \n\nNo one dared to penetrate her grief and force her out of the dress. She spent the day in it, slept in it, even bathed in it; since we live in a warm and arid weather, having it dry wasn’t an issue, only everything else.\n\nThe once beautiful organza and silk were now ragged, grimy and smelling. But she still refused to take it off. She started to believe that Aiden wouldn’t be able to spot her in the crowd if she wasn’t wearing it.\n\nIt was impossible to change her mind, and even though she was seeing a therapist three times a week, she wasn’t improving. Her mourning and PTSD were turning into a darker, more permanent mental illness.\n\nShe started talking to Aiden, then explained to us that he was nearby, so she could feel him coming. He was just taking a while because flying is really hard when your wings are newly-acquired.\n\nThen one morning, she disappeared for good. No one saw her leaving, and no one saw her at all after that.\n\nThe only thing that we were able to find, in the small grove behind the house, was her filthy wedding dress. It had two large holes poked on her back, like it had grown wings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter finding the dress, everyone who loved Pauline was relieved; her mother readily admitted that she actually believed that Aiden somehow had come back to take her. Others weren’t so fond of the supernatural explanation, but thinking that there was a chance that it happened brought us a sense of closure.\n\nIt’s not that we were happy about her death, but we conformed to the possibility of her finally finding her peace.\n\nShe was an angel, after all. Why wouldn’t she grow wings and escape her flesh prison?\n\nThe family held a beautiful memorial service in her honor, and slowly we all started moving on with our lives.\n\nNow, you might ask what I believe in. I would laugh bitterly because I don’t have this choice to begin with.\n\nBeing the person who spent the most time watching Pauline those days, it was only natural that I was the one to found her dead in the bathtub. Hiding and subsequently getting rid of her body was the hardest thing I have ever done; tampering with the dress, though, was eerily healing.\n\nStill, I think that she would be pleased to know that I faked her rapture. \n\nA romantic and mystifying death fitted her way more than suicide[.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PPoisoningTales\/)"},"223":{"title":"My girlfriend talks in her sleep.

Far from it.  I would think about her every moment she was away.  I would sometimes sit on my couch and just stare at my phone waiting for her to text.  I’d tell myself “Don’t contact her.  *Don't*.   It will come off as too strong.”  But then I’d still find myself clicking her name on my contact list before my inner voice would continue, “You don’t want her to know how desperately smitten you are with her.  It’s unattractive.  It will scare her off.  No, you must wait for her to call you this time.”\n\nBut it was excruciating and exhausting.  Almost unbearable.  I once heard that the ancient Greeks believed that falling madly and irrationally in love with somebody was a curse that you would wish upon your enemies.  I could never understand what they meant.  After all, isn’t falling head over heels in love the ultimate goal nowadays?  But now that it’s happened to me, I have to say… the ancient Greeks were right.  This is a curse.  I was barely in control of myself.  Almost as though my infatuation with her had… possessed me.\n\nThe two of us were sexually active together but still in the “dating” phase.  We were at that make or break era of a blossoming relationship where we’d either have “the talk” and formally be in a relationship or we’d start to slowly drift apart.  The latter of which I don’t think I’d be able to cope with.  Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to.  Almost everything about her captivated me.  The way she held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  How she’d caress the pendant of her necklace when she was frightened.  How she’d twirl her hair in her finger when she was excited.   All of it.  Her smell.  Her smile.  Her eyes.  \n\nYeah, I know.  It probably makes you sick reading about it.  I feel the same way.  I was never the hopeless romantic type.  But now I can’t stop fantasizing about her.  I’d think about us doing the long three-hour hike up to that magnificent view from one of our first dates.  To that first kiss, as we overlooked the lights of the city.  But this time I’d get down on one knee, bring out the ring, and… well… you know what would happen next.  \n\nAlright, fine.  I’ll stop.  Yes, this is a girl I’d only been casually dating for a couple of months.  I shouldn’t be thinking about proposing yet.  I know that.  I'm just barely able to control myself any longer.  I feel as though I’m losing power over the decisions I make. \n\nAnd that brings me to why I’m here writing this out at the moment.  It started with the first real thing that troubled me about her. We’d never actually spent a night together.  No matter how late she was over, once either of us showed signs of being tired, she’d up and leave.  She wouldn’t leave awkwardly or in anger. Just a casual kiss good night, a smile, and a “call me soon”. \n\nIt was something I didn’t really even notice the first few times she did it.  But after almost 8 weeks of dating, it was becoming strange.  I’d have to ask her about it.\n\nIt took drinking almost an entire bottle of wine before I had the courage to do it.  She looked almost defeated when I asked and lowered her eyes in embarrassment.  “I knew this talk would come eventually,” She started.  She took in a deep breath with a long drawn out exhale.  “Recently….“  she paused again.  “I’ve started talking in my sleep.”  She shook her head in embarrassment.    “It’s called somniloquy, I looked it up.”  \n\nI shrugged and laughed out loud.  My demeanor seemed to say “That’s it?”\n\n“No, Stephen… listen” she said.  She wasn’t laughing.  “It’s bad.  It… It’s completely out of control.  It’s not just random words or gibberish.  No.  It’s horrible.  I say horrible disgusting things.”  She was starting to raise her voice, breath heavy,  and tear up.\n\nI approached her and held her.  I told her it couldn’t be that bad.  I told her to spend the night.  I told her she was probably exaggerating.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThat night she stayed at my house.  But she warned me of something before falling asleep.  “Whatever you do, don’t wake me up.  It makes me really scared and disoriented if that happens.  And don’t respond to me.  Just ignore it.”  I nodded and agreed.   “If it becomes too much,” she continued, “just leave the room and sleep on the couch.  I won’t mind.”\n\nI told her not to worry about it. I told her that it wouldn’t be a big deal.  I told her I wouldn’t leave to the couch.  I’d stay beside her in the bed.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nI couldn’t even last one night.\n\n***\n\nWe both fell asleep without incident.  I don’t know how many hours passed, but I woke up in the dark with the sensation that someone was watching me.  And then I remembered… *She* was with me.  She was actually spending the night.  I smiled.\n\nBut then I noticed the shadowy outline of her sitting up on the bed.  She was looking down at me.  Staring.  \n\nIt creeped me out.  I’ll admit it.  Her posture was entirely different.  It was as though it wasn’t even her at all.\n\nThen she spoke.\n\nIt wasn’t her voice that I heard.  It was much lower and gravelly.  Like something out of a horror movie.\n\n“*I’ll chew the skin from your bones.*”  She said.\n\nI froze. \n\nAt first, I just kept looking at her.  This was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be more like the way Tourette’s is often portrayed.  Just random swearing and shouting.   I honestly thought to myself… what will I do if she attacks me right now?  What if she really does try to chew the skin from my bones?  \n\nBut then she just lied down and went back to sleep.\n\nI was creeped out.  I tried to lie back down and ignore her but struggled.  I couldn’t even close my eyes without thinking “Maybe she’s sitting up again and staring at me.”  And then one time I rolled over to look at her…and she *was*.\n\nHer face was pressed right towards mine.  Her breath was foul and rotted.  Something that was most certainly not normal for her.  She spoke again, in the same voice as before.\n\n“*If you don’t move to the couch, you’ll be dead by morning.*”\n\nThat did it for me.  I sat up in a moment and headed for the living room.\n\nShe made some sort of wheezing sound as I left.  I think it was supposed to be laughter.\n\nI was lying on the couch, but I wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep.  I was far too shaken.\n\nI was staring out towards the window, hoping to see the first few hints of the sun rising.\n\nAnd then I thought I heard something.  From the bedroom.\n\nI listened.\n\nAnd then I heard it again. \n\n“*Stephen.*”   It was that same low and gravelly voice. It sounded like a witch. \n\nI tried to just ignore it at first.  But then it continued. \n\n“*Stephen.*”  \n\nStill I said nothing.  \n\n“*I know you can hear me, Stephen.  You’re awake now.  Why don’t you come back into the bedroom?*”\n\nThe voice barely sounded human.  \n\n“*Or maybe you’d prefer if I come to **you**?*”\n\nI still didn’t say anything.  I was told not to.  But I listened.  If I heard her start walking towards the bedroom door, I’m not even joking, I would have run right out of the apartment. But she had asked me not to respond to her sleep talking.  So I didn’t.\n\nAnd then I heard her once more.\n\n“*Sorry if this spoils your plans.*”   She began laughing.  “*The two of you were supposed to walk that trail again.*” she started.  I wasn’t even remotely prepared for what she’d say next.\n\n “*You’d both be so tired when you’d reach the top.  You’d look over the city.  Then you’ll get on one knee, and bring out the ring.*”  She began laughing. \n\nAnd that’s when I realized this wasn’t just a problem with sleep talking.  It was something much more.  Something supernatural.  I had never told anybody about my proposal fantasy.  There was simply no way she could have known about any of it.\n\nThis was no longer about merely talking in ones’ sleep.  This was about possession. I can’t go back into the bedroom.  I have no idea what would happen if I did.  Instead, I’m going to wait it out, holding up in my living room until the sun rises.  I have a couple more hours yet.  I can hear her laughing occasionally in the bedroom. It’s still not her voice. Still that same low pitch cackle.\n\nBut as I sit on my couch writing this out, here’s what scares me the most…\n\nMaybe my infatuation and utter obsession with her wasn’t normal.  I said before that I felt like I was losing control of myself.  More so I believe than the typical falling in love story.  No.  I fear that the infatuation I felt was the entity slowly taking control of *me*.  Of it controlling my thoughts, fears, ambitions, and anxieties.  Maybe once I become completely absorbed, a transfer would occur, and she would be free of it. \n\nI know I should leave.  That I should open the front door, get in my car, and drive away from here.  But I can’t. I can’t leave her.  I’ve already lost control.\n\nI’m infatuated with her.\n\nUtterly infatuated."},"224":{"title":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5wduaf\/emergency_alert\/","flair":"Series","author":"TheCrystalGem","selftext":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***\n-THIS IS NOT A TEST\n-IMMEDIATE THREAT FOR RESIDENTS OF [withheld] COUNTIES\n-BE WARY OF:\n  -SEVERE WINDS\n  -LIGHTNING\n  -SEVERE RAIN\n  -FLASH FLOODS\n-RESIDENTS ARE ADVISED TO STAY INDOORS\n  -PLEASE LOCK OR BAR ALL ENTRYWAYS INTO YOUR HOUSE\n-RESTRAIN FROM USING ANY DEVICES THAT EMIT LIGHT OR LOUD NOISE\n-PLEASE ENTER A ROOM WITH NO WINDOWS\n-EFFECTIVE INDEFINITELY\n-ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE\n\nThis was the message I was greeted by in the middle of an episode of Big Bang Theory in my living room. Frozen halfway through a forkful of Kraft Mac N' Cheese, I sat bolt upright and turned around to look out the window. The sky, as I thought, was crystal clear. A few clouds, but nothing crazy. No rain. No thunder. Nothing. Confused, I turned off the TV, erasing the alert from the screen. My two dogs came walking over to me and I patted them on their heads. One of my dogs, the other's brother, was shaking profusely from the buzzing noise that always shows up with Amber Alerts and the like. I left them in the living room and walked through my kitchen and onto my front porch. My neighbors, too, were standing outside their houses, all looking at the sky in bemusement.\n\nAn immediate threat? It didn't seem like it, I thought as my phone started buzzing with the same tone. One by one, everyone else's phones started ringing.\n\nI should explain, I guess, that I have never experienced a severe weather warning for real. Not once in my life. I suppose it should come as no surprise, seeing as I live in Oregon of all places. I supposed maybe it was just a mistake, but just as the thought floated across my mind, I heard the  siren.\n\nThe siren of the squad car coming down the street. An officer talked through the speaker. \"This is not a drill. Please enter your homes immediately. Do not go outside under any circumstances.\"\n\nNever the kind of guy to ignore higher authorities, I entered my house nervously, turned off all the lights on the above-ground floors, and took my dogs into my basement with a sleeping bag, some food, my phone, a charger, some spare batteries, flashlight, and other essentials. I called my brother, who lives a couple of blocks away, and asked him if he had gotten the message. He had. I considered saying we should stay together to wait out the storm, but then I figured we'd probably get in trouble for that. So I hung up, got comfortable on my sleeping bag, and started browsing Reddit. Eventually, I fell asleep, seeing as I was under stress and had woken up pretty early. When I woke up, I realized that I still didn't hear any rain. Seriously, nothing at all. More confused than ever, I decided to see if the alert had been called off. I turned on my phone and called my brother again. It went straight to voicemail, though, so I gave up. I decided to risk it and go upstairs. I had to squeeze between the door and the wall to keep my dogs from following me upstairs, but I won and they stayed in the basement. I walked through my kitchen to the front door and looked out the window part of it. As I squinted to see outside in the dark (strange, seeing as it was only 2:00 PM judging by my clock), the TV flickered briefly. I looked around at it and it flickered again, but this time every device on the ground floor flickered. Thinking little of it, I turned around and looked through the door again. Every house on the block had its lights turned off. Nobody was outside.\n\nExcept for one teenage girl.\n\nA thin, short-haired girl wearing what looked like a pillowcase walked unsteadily down the street, very slowly, looking as though she was having some difficulty. I turned around, now extremely confused and worried, and got the dogs' food bowls, which I had forgotten earlier. When I looked up, one of the houses, the one diagonally across from mine (right next to the house across the street and to the left) had it's lights on and one of its windows broken. I shuddered and rushed back into the basement as the lights flickered intensely.\n\nI locked the door to the basement and sat on an old, tattered couch that I had brought down here--the basement is where I put everything I didn't have room for. So, yeah, it's packed. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something that may be worth noting: I live in a small town. A very small town, probably with a population of under 500. Or less. As a matter of fact, it isn't even on most maps. We never make any news, we never have any scandals or anything. This is the first interesting thing that's happened, I think, since Mrs. [withheld] lost her dentures to a raccoon. So, it's possible this whole thing seems way worse than it is.\n\nCall me crazy, but until a few minutes ago, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I love these scenarios, and my basement is totally secure, so I'm having the time of my life. Well, I was. I decided to turn on my radio--what harm could it do, as long as I didn't turn the volume up to high?\n\nI was surprised to find that our local radio station was still up and running. They were talking about the weather, so I listened hard for any news that I hadn't heard. There wasn't any--they were just as confused as us. Not wanting to listen to crappy pop music indefinitely, I tuned into another station. This one was one I hadn't heard before.\n\n-\"Could you give me the status of [withheld] county? Over.\"\n-\"No new developments. Over.\"\n-\"Okay. Any fatalities? Over.\"\n-\"What part of \"no new developments\" do you not understand, McClellan? A squad car will be passing through soon to scan the area for the target. Over.\"\n-\"Any ETA on that? Over.\"\n-\"No, not yet. Over.\"\n-\"And any word from HQ, Jones? Over.\"\n-\"No, McClellan. Not yet. Not since 013 first got out. Over.\"\n-\"Well, let me know if and when they contact you. Over.\"\n\nAt that point, I lost the signal. Well, not really, but the connection got so weak that I could barely make out anything they were saying. I figured I must have found a police communication channel. And I had been left with no answers whatsoever.\n\nThat was about forty-five minutes ago, as of me writing this now. Guys, I don't know what's going on. Do any of you live near me? You'll know if you've received the warning. I'd say what county I live in, and which ones were affected, but I don't know to for privacy reasons. Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated, okay? Until then, wish me luck.\n\nEDIT: Woah, guys, this has blown up. I'll be sure to keep you posted over the next few days!\n\nUPDATE: Just a quick update before the first major update--about five minutes ago, a car alarm went off somewhere to the right of my house. I'm too freaked out to go check it out, but I'll go up and see how it looks tomorrow morning, and I'll update you then.\n\nNEXT UPDATE COMING TODAY"},"225":{"title":"I work security at Disney World... well, I mean I did.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8oueb7\/i_work_security_at_disney_world_well_i_mean_i_did\/","flair":null,"author":"disneysecurity","selftext":"I work in security at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth.

Apparently a couple of days before that, housekeeping had went into a room that should’ve been turned over that day (turned over is when one guest leaves by about 11:00 a.m. and the next guest checks in around 3:00 p.m.) and all of the guests’ items were still in the room. Housekeeping made a note of it and moved on, but during the next two days when they entered the room, everything was still there and untouched.\n\nI went to check it out and sure enough there was an empty room full of luggage, clothes, snacks, some toys, everything a family would need for vacation. The manager had already looked up the previous reservation and it was for a family – dad, mom, two little kids. I tried to call the phone numbers they had given but all I got was voice mail. We were a bit stumped so I made the call that housekeeper could clean the room and take the family’s personal items to be held until we got in contact with someone.\n\nI went digging into the reservation more. The family had arrived five days before housekeeping discovered all of their stuff.  I found that the family had paid a parking fee and their vehicle description was listed. A quick walk of the parking lots and I had easily located their vehicle. So that ruled out a car accident or them deciding to just leave all their stuff behind. \n\nNext, I saw that they had bought a dining plan. This is when a guest prepays for all of their food. They’re given a certain number of “credits” to use for meals. This family had only used 3 credits and the last one was two days after they checked in. It appeared that the day they arrived, they got here late and probably just stayed on the resort. The next day they used 2 credits at Epcot. The second park day they used just 1 credit at Magic Kingdom and it was at breakfast time. \n\nNow at Disney we have something called Magic Bands. Magic Bands are worn by the guests and act as a room key, park ticket, credit card, dining reservation payment, fastpass (a system used to bypass lines), and more. It took some work, but I was finally able to look up this family’s fastpass history. The day they went to Magic Kingdom, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the park, rode a couple of rides, and then rode their last ride, It’s a Small World around 11:00 a.m. Then nothing.\n\nFinally, it was time to bring in someone else on this. I called an old co\\-worker at Magic Kingdom and asked him to pull security footage for It’s a Small World at the time they rode it and I made my way over there. When I got there, my friend was very confused, almost distraught, looking. He showed me what he found. There’s usually a camera in the direction of where rides load and unload. The footage showed them scanning their bands to use fastpasses for the ride and boarding the ride. The footage from the exit of the ride just showed the other people in their car exiting. They weren’t there.\n\nOf course we thought the worse, maybe one of the kids had fallen out and mom and dad and the other kid got off in the middle of the ride to help and they all got injured or killed or stuck in machinery somewhere. So we shut down the ride. Middle of the damn day. Turned off that ear worm music and turned up the lights. Me and my buddy walked that ride three times before we called in help. Eventually there was close to ten cast members searching, and we didn’t find shit except for three cell phones and a hat.\n\nI was right stumped. I've kept digging the past couple of days, and I’m not sure who to tell what I found next to. I’ve called the police and I suppose they’re on the way, but the company has a way of covering up things like this and I decided I can’t live with myself if I don’t put out some type of warning.\n\nI kept digging into their reservation over the last couple of days and today I noticed they had purchased memory maker. There are photographers all over the parks and cameras in a lot of the rides and, with memory maker, the photos are all free. They automatically get added to a guest’s Disney account when the system knows their picture has been taken. And the system always knows. Everyone’s whereabouts are always known with the Magic Bands.\n\nWell, I opened up their memory maker photo album and, I swear, there’s 732 pictures. The first 30 or so are pretty normal. Epcot, a few rides, in front of the castle. But the rest. The rest are all in It’s a Small World. The rides only take one picture per go around. So it appears as though this family has ridden this ride over 700 times. The first picture was pretty normal. Everyone looked happy, it was busy day and a full car of guests.  The next one is rough to look at. The car is empty except for this little family and they look so darn confused. The next 10\\-15 I can see dad getting angry, yelling. Mom is holding onto those two kids like her life depends on it and you can see the kids getting increasingly upset, crying. And it goes on, and on, and on. After 50 or so it looks like they’re trying to get out. In one the dad is missing. In another they’re all gone.  Maybe like they’ve bailed early in the ride and tried to walk out, but in the very next one, they’re all right back in that damn car. After around 450 or so, I only see the mom and kids. It’s just when I look closely I can see dad, maybe just his body now, slumped down in one of the other seats. Since about 675, there’s just mom and one kid. Another body in another seat.  The mom and kid aren’t moving anymore. I think them two are still alive, just damn near catatonic. Looking straight ahead, pale.  \n\nAnd, y’all, I swear on my fucking life, the dolls are moving or something. In some of these pictures I can tell they aren’t where they should be. I even saw one with a doll in the car with this family.\n\nI can’t look anymore or I’m going to lose my lunch. I closed the album. It’s file sized has increased since I closed it. God, are there new pictures being added? \n\nI see on security cameras that the local PD just arrived so they’ll take over soon. I wish I knew what the fuck is going on, but I also wish this damn thing had never landed in my lap. I don’t think I’ll be able to update this. After I talk to the police, I think I’m going to walk out of here and never come back. I just wanted to get this out there, before Disney feeds the media some bullshit cover up as to why a whole family vanished. They didn’t vanish. I know where they are."},"226":{"title":"My husband insists on keeping this one painting of a woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/twijls\/my_husband_insists_on_keeping_this_one_painting\/","flair":null,"author":"RobertMort","selftext":"When my husband and I first got married and moved in together, we had a few fights. On personal space, on chores… and on décor.\n\nNamely, my husband insisted on keeping this weird painting of a woman.\n\n“Who is she?” I’d asked when I first saw it, leaned against a mountain of moving boxes.\n\n“Dunno. Got it at a rummage sale.”\n\nIt was an original painting. Oil, I think, judging by the way the light reflected off the brushstrokes. It depicted a young woman standing in a dark room, looking over her shoulder at the viewer. She was actually rather beautiful. Blonde hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. A white cotton dress. A dainty, heart-shaped face that was somehow haunting rather than cute.\n\nShe was illuminated brightly, but the room behind her was dark. The contrast and her pose reminded me a little bit of *Girl With A Pearl Earring*. But it didn’t feel classy, or pensive, or beautiful. Instead it felt… creepy.\n\nEspecially because my husband insisted on hanging it above our bed.\n\n“I mean, it’s a beautiful painting,” I said. “But it just doesn’t fit with the modern décor.”\n\n“Neither do your Funko Pops.”\n\n“Okay, but they’re small. This painting is *enormous.* For Pete’s sake, the woman is nearly life-sized!”\n\n“I want to keep her where she is.”\n\nIt seemed like a big deal to him, so I dropped it. But it wasn’t easy. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible feeling that I was being watched. Then I’d look up and see her haunting gray eyes staring down at me.\n\nI didn’t get much sleep after that.\n\nAnd there was the one time I swear she moved. “Was her hand always like that?” I asked Eric, after getting into bed one night.\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“Her left hand. The fingers are kind of open, reaching out behind her. Like she’s waiting for someone to grab her hand.”\n\n“Yeah, she was always like that.”\n\nI could’ve sworn she *wasn’t* always like that. Then again, I generally avoided looking at the painting. It was so uncomfortably realistic. When I stared into those gray eyes, I almost felt like I was making eye contact with a person.\n\nI lasted two weeks. Then I begged Eric to move it.\n\n“Can we *please* move the painting somewhere else? I really hate looking at it when I’m going to sleep.”\n\n“It’s the nicest piece of art we have. It belongs above the bed.”\n\n“What about the sunflower one?”\n\n“That’s just a print,” he complained. “And it’s so basic.”\n\n“Come on. I’ll move my Funko Pops out if you move the painting out.”\n\nHe heaved a long sigh. “Fine. I’ll move her.”\n\nThat was another thing. He often referred to the painting as “her.” It was weird.\n\nSo he moved it to the stairs. But honestly, that was worse. Every time I went downstairs, there she was. Staring at me from above the landing with those piercing gray eyes. At least when the painting was in the bedroom, I was usually asleep or facing the opposite direction.\n\nI hit my breaking point a few days after that.\n\nFor some reason I couldn’t sleep. After tossing and turning for an hour, I decided to grab a snack downstairs. I got to the top of the stairs… and there she was.\n\nI hadn’t turned on the main lights—only the nightlight in the hall bathroom was on. With everything so dark, the background of the painting melted into the shadows. But the woman still stood out, with her pale face and white dress.\n\nAnd my stupid, sleepy brain interpreted it as an actual person standing there.\n\nI jumped about a foot in the air. And I would’ve fallen all the way down the stairs, had I not caught the banister at the last second.\n\n“Can we pleeeease get rid of that painting?” I asked the next morning.\n\nEric turned away from the stove, set the spatula down. “Why?”\n\n“Last night, it scared the frick out of me. I nearly fell down the stairs.”\n\nHe stared at me, as if unable to understand. “She… scared you?” he asked slowly.\n\n“Well, more like startled me. I thought it was actually a person standing there.”\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nThen he broke into laughter. And, after a few seconds, I started laughing too. It *was* pretty stupid, now that I thought about it. I know I was sleepy, but still—I thought the painting was a *person?!* What, did I think we were being burglarized by a young, beautiful, blonde woman in a nightdress?\n\n“For now, I’ll move her into my office. Then you don’t have to look at her at all.”\n\n“That sounds good.”\n\nAnd for a while after that, things were okay. I sort of noticed Eric spending more time in his office than usual, but he also had a big deadline for a brief coming up. And what, how would that be related to the painting, anyway? It’s not like he was staring at her for hours on end.\n\nExcept that’s exactly what I caught him doing.\n\nOne night he didn’t come downstairs to eat dinner with me. I called up to him a few times. No reply. So I went upstairs and walked into his office—to find him staring at her.\n\nHe was just sitting there. With his computer closed. No papers on the desk. Swivel chair turned towards the woman in the painting.\n\n“Oh,” he said suddenly, when I walked in. Then he quickly stood up. “I was just about to come down. Just sent in the brief a few minutes ago. They’re really happy with it.”\n\nHe smiled broadly at me, as if nothing were wrong, and then slipped past me. I listened to his footsteps thump down the stairs.\n\n*Had he actually just finished working?*\n\n*Or was he just sitting in here… staring at her?*\n\nI ultimately decided not to bring it up. The painting was out of my sight and that was great. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry, like my own deadline coming up for an article I hadn’t even started.\n\nBut then, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally overheard him on the phone. His voice was muffled through the thick wooden door, but it wasn’t hard to hear him. He was shouting, almost.\n\n*“I’ll have it in by tonight—”*\n\n*“No, I knew it was due on Wednesday—”*\n\n*“Well, my wife fell down the stairs. I had to take her to the hospital.”*\n\nThose words sent a chill through me. I barged in.\n\n“Why are you lying about me falling down the stairs?”\n\nHis face paled. He ended the call and turned towards me. “I’m so sorry, Tara. But I needed an excuse. I missed the deadline on that brief, and it’s my job on the line—\"\n\n“The brief you told me you finished two days ago?”\n\nHe nodded, silently.\n\nI crossed my arms. “Look, Eric, your work is your business. But we’ve spent, like, all of one hour together all week. Because you’ve been locked in here all day, every day. I mean, are you even working? Or are you just sitting in here, staring at *her?*”\n\nHis dark eyes locked on mine. And then his voice grew soft. \n\n“You’re jealous of her.”\n\n“… *What?!”*\n\n“You shouldn’t be, Tara,” he said, stepping towards me. “The painting makes her prettier than she was.”\n\nI froze. Stared at him.\n\nThen I finally found the words. “Are you saying… this is a painting of someone you know?”\n\n“No,” he said slowly. “Sorry, I misspoke. I meant, whoever this is a portrait of, I’m sure it’s a flattering likeness. All portraits are flattering like that.”\n\nI stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n“Who is this a painting of, Eric?”\n\n“I told you, it’s not—”\n\n“Eric.” I stepped towards him. My legs felt weak, wobbling underneath me. “*Who is this a painting of?!”*\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI couldn’t sleep that night.\n\nI know, it sounds silly, being so worked up over a painting. But you have to admit it was weird. He was obsessed with this thing, for whatever reason. *Why didn’t I see the painting when we were dating? Did he hide it away in the basement?* That was the one place I’d never been. Had he built a little shrine down there, painting, candles, the whole nine yards?\n\nThe thought of it made me sick.\n\n*Is it an ex-girlfriend? An ex-wife, even, that he never told me about?* Getting a painting commissioned must have cost a fortune. Especially a huge, detailed one like this. I mean, as much as I hated that thing, it was clearly done by someone incredibly gifted. The glint in those piercing gray eyes, the small dimple on her right cheek…\n\nBut clearly he wasn’t keeping it to appreciate the artistry.\n\n*He knew her.*\n\n*And whoever she is, he’s obsessed with her.*\n\nAnd then I got the craziest idea.\n\nI sat up in bed. Slowly, quietly. Turned to Eric. He was fast asleep. Then I slipped out from underneath the covers, grabbed my phone from the nightstand—and tiptoed out of the room.\n\nMy bare feet padded softly across the hallway as I made my way towards his office. Then I pushed the heavy wooden door open and stepped inside.\n\nThe office was cold—much colder than our bedroom. Goosebumps pricked up my bare arms. But I didn’t waste any time. I reached over, fumbling across the wall, and hit the switch.\n\nThe light flicked on.\n\nThe blonde woman stared down at me from the wall. Her eyes seemed to follow me as I took Eric’s leather chair and dragged it across the hardwood. Once against the wall, I stepped up onto it.\n\nWe were staring at each other, face to face.\n\nI’d never been this close to the painting before. My face inches from hers. This close, I could truly appreciate the detail. Each individual eyelash painstakingly drawn, curving up from its follicle. Threadlike striations of light and dark gray filling her irises. Her skin, so pale and creamy, dotted with the tiniest of pores.\n\nBut I wasn’t here to appreciate the artwork.\n\nI lifted my phone—and took a photo.\n\nThen I brought up a reverse image search.\n\nIt took a few minutes for me to find the right website and upload the photo. But when the results loaded… I gasped.\n\nI expected maybe one result, if I were lucky. Some sort of facial recognition that would match the painted face to a photo. Or, maybe the artist’s website would come up, and mention who the subject was. But instead—*dozens* of thumbnails filled the page. Of the exact same painting I’d been staring at for weeks.\n\nFingers trembling, I clicked on the first one. It led to a news article.\n\n**Search Continues for Missing Franklin Art Student**\n\nMy heart dropped. Little black dots danced in my vision. I collapsed into the chair behind me, trembling, and began to read.\n\n*Anya Kelsing, 23, went missing after a hike with her boyfriend…*\n\n*The two became separated when they came upon a bear…*\n\n*Her backpack was found roughly a mile from where the sighting occurred, but no trace of Anya was found…*\n\nAnd the caption under the painting.\n\n*Kelsing is a third-year student at Franklin College, majoring in Fine Arts. She recently completed a self-portrait that was exhibited at Le Coeur (above)*\n\nI clicked on the next article, and the next—but they all said the same thing. Hike, bear, disappearance. All of them showed a photo along with her self-portrait; she looked strikingly identical to her painted likeness. None of them mentioned the boyfriend’s name, but it had to be Eric. The most recent article, from five years ago, was a video clip of her parents begging for her search to continue. Sadly, judging by the news articles, it never did.\n\nI don’t know how long I sat there. All I know is that I was suddenly jolted from my thoughts by a loud *thump* in the hallway.\n\nFootsteps. Coming towards the office.\n\nI shot up. *He can’t find me here.* I glanced around the room, looking for someplace—any place—that I could hide. But it was probably too late. Surely he’d seen the light on, from under the door…\n\nI ducked under the desk just as he stepped into the room.\n\n“Tara?”\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, trying to silence my ragged breathing. *He’s going to see the chair out of place. He knows I’m here. He knows…*\n\n“Tara, you in here?”\n\n*Why did I hide? I could’ve just said I came in here because I heard a noise. Needed a pen. Couldn’t sleep. Why the fuck did I hide? Now he’s going to know that I know…*\n\n“Tara?”\n\n*But maybe it’s fine. Maybe the bear got Anya, maybe Eric had nothing to do with it. Isn’t that more likely than Eric being a murderer?*\n\n“There you are.”\n\nI looked up—and screamed.\n\nEric was crouched there, in front of the desk, staring at me.\n\n“I—I was looking for a pen,” I stuttered, lamely. “I wanted to write down—I remembered I have to pick up groceries tomorrow and I needed to add something…”\n\nHe tilted his head, a small smile on his lips. “I don’t think that’s the truth, Tara.”\n\n*Make a break for it.*\n\nI started to lunge out from under the desk. His hand quickly shot out and grabbed my wrist. *Hard.* “You figured out who she is, didn’t you? That’s the only reason you’d be hiding from me.”\n\nI trembled in his grasp. “What did you do to her?” I whispered.\n\nHe let out a dry laugh. “So you think I’m a murderer. How nice, that’s the first conclusion you jump to.”\n\n“No—no, I don’t think you’re a murderer.” I swallowed. *Stupid, stupid, stupid. If he killed her, and he knows you know… then you’re dead too.* “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. Just… what happened? They didn’t find a body. Did the bear get her?”\n\nHe didn’t reply. Just stared at me, silently, with those cold dark eyes.\n\n“I was jealous,” I continued, desperately, “but now I understand. I wish you’d just told me. To lose someone like that… of course you’d want to keep the painting. It’s all you have left of her.”\n\n“You should have just left it alone,” he said, his tone oddly emotionless. “I’m sorry you had to find out this way.”\n\nI screamed as he lunged for me.\n\n*It’s over.* His hands were clenched tight on my wrists as he dragged me out from under the desk. I pulled back, trying to wrench myself free, but it was no use—\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA loud crash sounded behind us. Eric whipped around, and for a split second—his grip released.\n\nI acted instantly. Pulled free from him and ran, pivoting around the desk and racing towards the door. As I glanced back, I saw Eric, starting after me.\n\nBut I also saw what had made the noise.\n\nThe painting of Anya had fallen from the wall. It lay askew on the floor, her gray eyes staring emptily upwards.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was always a fast runner.\n\nEric was only halfway down the stairs by the time I was at the bottom. Bursting out into the cold air, I began to scream. He grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back inside, but it was too late. Lights were flicking on. Our neighbor rushed out of his house, dialing 911.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThe police arrested Eric for assault. And once I told them my story, of his obsession with Anya’s painting, they were able to search our house. And hidden in his office drawer, in a small box, was a pair of gold earrings.\n\nThe same earrings Anya wore on the hike that day.\n\nThe case is slowly mounting against him. I’m hoping, praying Anya gets justice and that a jury convicts him of her horrible murder.\n\nAnd would he have done the same to me, if I hadn’t escaped? If Anya’s painting hadn’t fallen off the wall?\n\nThere was an explanation, of course. When Eric had moved the painting to his office, he’d mistakenly installed one of the hangers into pure drywall. The weight of the painting had caused it to rip out, and the painting fell.\n\nBut sometimes, I think Anya was watching over me. That her self-portrait carried a piece of her. And that night, she’d protected me from falling victim to the monster who ended her life.\n\nThe painting now hangs up in my foyer. Every day I walk by it, and new details pop out at me: the deep, shadowy green of the room behind her. A perfectly-painted strand of blonde hair. The glint in her piercing gray eyes.\n\nAnd sometimes, I think she’s smiling back at me."},"227":{"title":"My wife has a removable face.

We were watching a movie on her couch when I made my move to kiss her. She whipped her hand in front of my face and blocked me.\n\n“There’s something you need to know,” she said.\n\nI braced myself. *Here it comes. “I’m not ready for a relationship. Nothing to do with you, of course.”* It was the absolute last thing that I wanted to hear, because I was already crazy about her.\n\n“Okay,” I said.\n\n“I have a removable face.”\n\n*That’s a new one.* “You have a what now?” I was about to laugh, but she was wearing a deadly serious expression.\n\n“I have a removable face.”\n\n“Is that, like, a metaphor or something?”\n\n“No. My face is literally removable. Look. Closely.” She lifted her chin and traced her jaw line with a finger. “You can see the seam.”\n\nAfter admiring how beautiful her neck was for a dizzying moment, I leaned in for an inspection. It was very hard to see, but it *did* look like there was a slightly unnatural transition there from her face to her throat. I grew dizzier, as a dozen questions rushed into my brain.\n\n“Don’t bother asking why or how or anything like that,” said Samantha. “I can’t tell you that. If that’s going to be a problem, you should leave now. I’m letting you know this because I like you, and I want to take the next step, but this is non-negotiable.”\n\n“Okay,” I said, unsure of what was happening. “Not a problem. So what? You have a removable face. Who cares? It looks good.”\n\n“There’s something else. Once a day, usually in the evening, I have to remove the face and disinfect the inside of it. If I don’t, it will rot. This takes about an hour, give or take, depending on how my day went. During this time, you must never *ever* look at my real face. *Never*. Do you understand?”\n\n“Y… yes. Got it. Don’t ask about it, don’t look at your… ‘real’ face.”\n\nSamantha stood up. “Now, I’m going to go into the bathroom and clean my face. That will give you plenty of time to think about what I’ve told you. If you’re here when I’m done… that’s great. I would like that. But if you’re gone… I’ll understand.”\n\nShe turned and walked into her bedroom. I sat in stunned silence as I heard the bathroom door close.\n\nI gave the thing some serious thought. It was possible that it was a joke of some kind. It was possible that it was a delusion. Was it possible that it was true? Well, it was certainly possible to transform an actor’s face with movie makeup, so I supposed it was possible that Samantha wore a “removable face” every day. Maybe she had had a horrible accident where her flesh had been mangled. Maybe her face had been melted by acid, or burned by fire, or the skin shorn off by heavy machinery. If it had, I would never know, because she would never tell me, and I would never see it.\n\nI pictured a face of raw, naked muscle, rotting away. Could I kiss her, if that was what I was kissing? But wasn’t that what we all were, under the skin? Just muscle and bone and blood and squishy organs.\n\nI paced around the living room, running my hand through my hair. I liked Samantha, a lot. She was smart, and funny… and beautiful. But was that beauty *real*? Did it count? Did it matter if it was “real” or not? Was I being superficial even worrying about it?\n\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, I was still there. I looked at her face. She smiled and I was in love.\n\n\\*\n\nWe dated, we moved in together, we decided to get married.\n\nFor the most part, it was a completely normal relationship, typical of two young people in love, building a life together. During the day, it was easy to forget about the face altogether. It looked natural enough, and only in certain positions, in certain lights, was there ever any indication that it *wasn’t* natural.\n\nBut every night was the same. Samantha would close herself in the bathroom – sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two – and clean the inside of her face. The curiosity never left me. I would sit there and wonder what was under that face. I came so close to barging in on her a few times, but I never did.\n\nI *did* occasionally ask her about it. About what, if anything, had happened. About how it was possible to make the removable face look so real. About what it really looked like underneath. I tried to coax her into showing me, assuring her that I loved her no matter what, and didn’t give a damn what her real face looked like… I was just curious, that’s all.\n\nShe never showed me, or told me the story behind it. She didn’t get upset at me (unless I was really badgering her.) She’d just shrug and say, “You know you can’t see it. You know I can’t tell you about it.”\n\n\\*\n\nI never told anybody about Samantha’s removable face. It’s not that she asked me not to. I just didn’t think it was anybody’s business.\n\nExcept once, I did tell somebody.\n\nIt was during my bachelor’s party. We had rented several cabins in Big Sur and spent the night drinking and packing our noses with powders that we shouldn’t have been packing our noses with. Everyone else had passed out and the sun was creeping up behind us as I stood on the majestic cliffs with my friend Chris, looking down on the pacific waves crashing against the rocks.\n\nChris was my best friend; as close to a brother as I’d known. We’d grown up together, and visited each other at college often, and spent the summers together. After college, we’d moved to different cities, but we stayed in close contact.\n\nStanding there on the cliffs, I told Chris about Samantha’s removable face. At first, he thought I was joking. Then he had a thousand questions, most of which I couldn’t answer.\n\n“What’s underneath?”\n\n“I don’t know, man. I don’t know.”\n\n“Doesn’t that drive you crazy, not knowing?”\n\nI shrugged. “Lots of stuff I don’t know. Don’t know how to do calculus, and I don’t know what happens when we die.”\n\n“But dude, she’s about to be your *wife*. And you don’t even know what she *looks like*. I mean, I’d have to take a look. Like, you could set a camera up in the bathroom. That’s where she does it, right? Set up a camera and have a look and then you’ll know.”\n\nI sighed. “Yeah, it drives me crazy. I’ve asked her a million times. But she told me I could never look. Gotta respect that, man, even if I don’t like it. That’s love.”\n\nChris laughed. “*You* telling *me* to respect a woman? Up is down now.”\n\nThen we fell back into talking about old times as a new day dawned.\n\n\\*\n\nChris was in town for business last week, and planned on spending the weekend at our house. The conversation at Big Sur had happened four years ago, and we hadn’t spoken about Samantha’s removable face since, despite keeping in close contact and seeing each other as often as two people transforming into adults in different parts of the country can.\n\nIt happened on Saturday evening. We were lounging lazily in the backyard, deep into the beer, having just finished with some grilled steaks, when I got a text from work.\n\n“Goddammit,” I groaned. “I have to make a work call.”\n\n“Seriously?” said Samantha, raising an artificial eyebrow. “On a Saturday night?”\n\n“My biggest client, baby. Sorry.”\n\n“It is what it is, I guess,” said my wife. “I’m going to head inside and get cleaned up. Chris? Are you okay just hanging out for a bit?”\n\nChris smiled. “I'll be fine. Got my beer, got some weeds to pull in your garden. God knows your lazy-ass husband isn’t going to do it. Those tomatoes are choking to death. It’s a tragedy.”\n\nI rolled my eyes and went into the side yard to make my call.\n\n15 minutes into it, I heard the screams coming from inside. Both my best friend and my wife were wailing in terror.\n\nI dropped the phone and ran into the house and down the hall to our bedroom. Through the open door, I could see that the door to the master bathroom was also standing open.\n\n“Don’t come in!” screamed Samantha. “I don’t have my face on! Call an ambulance! He looked! Oh God, he looked!” She sounded desperate, and truly horrified. That made me desperate and horrified, and I wanted to rush into the bathroom, but I knew suddenly that that would be a mistake.\n\nI knew suddenly that Samantha didn’t want me to look at her real face not out of a sense of vanity, but for my own safety.\n\nChris staggered backwards, out of the bathroom. He was holding a straightened out paperclip, which he had used to pick the privacy lock. Now he was stabbing it again and again into his eyes, shouting gibberish. He was clearly in the depths of madness, and it turned my stomach to see him mutilate himself.\n\n“Call a fucking ambulance!” my wife screamed. “Don’t come in here! He fucking LOOKED!”\n\nI turned and ran back to the side yard, where my phone was lying in the newly mowed grass. My client was still on the line, alarmed, asking what was happening, what all the screaming was. I hung up on him and called 911.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Chris was having a seizure in the hallway. Samantha was stroking his head, sobbing. Her face was on, but it had been done hastily, and everything looked a little off.\n\n\\*\n\nMy world has been dark this past week.\n\nMy best friend is in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. He’s completely blind and mostly catatonic, except when he slips into a violent, babbling mania. The doctors are optimistic that his state is temporary, but they don’t know the truth about what caused it, because I told the paramedics that Chris had taken a large dose of psychedelic mushrooms and fallen into psychosis.\n\nI saw no good reason to tell the truth about what had happened. Who would believe that one look at my wife’s “real” face would make somebody insane? At best, we would be the subjects of a long investigation; at worst, we would have to prove that what we were saying was true, by showing somebody Samantha’s face. Then the same thing would happen again, and what after that? I had no idea, and no interest in finding out. For Samantha’s part, I knew that she would never consent to show anybody her real face, no matter what the consequences of refusal were.\n\nI did get a follow-up call from the police, asking me to confirm my story. The hospital found no traces of psilocybin in Chris’ blood, though that’s not unheard of, since it has a short half-life. If they end up testing his hair, I will likely be in a lot of trouble. But that’s truly the least of my concerns.\n\nSamantha is in a state of her own. She still cleans the inside of her face, though not as regularly, and when she puts it back on, it’s always crooked now. It is beginning to smell a little bit.\n\nI’ve tried to assure her that it wasn’t her fault. “He *knew*,” I said. “I told him that nobody was ever allowed to look at it. He *knew* and then he *broke into the bathroom.* This is not on you, baby. Please. Talk to me.”\n\n“Not on me? That one look at my fucking *face* makes people insane? Please. I just need some time alone.”\n\nAs for me, I am doing my best to hold it together. Do you know what’s strange, though? Despite what happened to Chris, I still find myself curious about what my wife’s real face looks like. More curious than ever, really."},"228":{"title":"My Sleep Paralysis Demon is Actually A Pretty Chill Guy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/imhzg1\/my_sleep_paralysis_demon_is_actually_a_pretty\/","flair":null,"author":"writechriswrite","selftext":"My first memory of sleep paralysis happened when I was ten years old. I remember because it was the night my parents took me to see Shrek 2 for getting good marks on my report card. It was an evening show, so we got in late and my mom tucked me straight into bed when we got home.\n\nIt was around four am when I woke up, the light from my alarm clock told me that much. I couldn't feel anything, not my pajamas against my skin, or the warmth of my head against the pillow. I could feel my arms and legs, but they felt heavy, as if a great weight was holding them down. \n\nI tried to call out but I couldn’t, my voice caught in my throat, my lips unable to move. I mustered a weak groan that sounded like a cross between a frog’s croak and a zombie’s moan, but that was it. \n\nI thought I was dead, that this is what death feels like, being awake but unable to move or tell anyone. My mind wrestled with the idea of being placed in a coffin, unable to tell anyone I was still alive in here, unable to move or say anything as the lid closed and they put me in the ground, still alive.\n\nMy fear subsided as I felt my heart thudding in my chest in response to my near panic attack. I also became aware of my breathing, which slowed as the fear subsided. I calmed a little, thinking it was just a dream.\n\nThat was when I saw him for the first time. Mr. BrownStickLegs.\n\nHe huddled in the corner of the room by my closet. His two oversized red eyes glowed in the dark of my bedroom. His face was like a porcelain mask, white, expressionless, with no mouth or nose, only those two haunting red eyes. \n\nWhen he stood up, his body unfolded like origami until his head reached the ceiling. His neck bent, tilting forward as his true height was greater than the height of my room. His long black torso was covered in shimmering symbols that reflected red in the light of his glowing eyes. He stood on two spindly thin legs that disappeared into the shadows of the room. \n\nHe made no noise as he moved, seeming to glide as he hovered closer to my bed. His long thin arms reached down to me as I moaned through paralyzed lips. I could not scream, even though I very much wanted to.\n\nHis fingers reaching through the darkness, down to my face. Two pointed fingers touched against my eyelids, pushing them closed. I remember his fingertips feeling cool, but not cold. Even though the ends of his fingertips looked sharp, his touch was gentle.\n\n“Do not struggle, little one. Sleep, sleep,” he said. His voice was so deep I could feel it in my chest when he spoke.\n\nI did as instructed, convincing myself that it indeed was a dream. Even if it wasn’t, the back of my eyelids was more reassuring than looking into those piercing red eyes in his vacant mask of a face. I closed my eyes, wanting it to be a dream, willing it to be a dream. I woke up the next morning, thankfully able to move, walk and talk.\n\nI explained what I saw to my parents, who both agreed that it was a dream. My mom tried floating the idea that something from Shrek 2 scared me but neither my dad or I bought it. For confirmation, dad asked that I draw a picture of what I saw for them. As I was drawing, I ran out of black crayon and had to finish his legs with the next darkest color in my crayon box. \n\n“Hey there, Mister BrownStickLegs,” my Dad said as I handed him the drawing. “You leave my daughter alone now, you hear?”\n\nThis is how my sleep paralysis demon ended up with the name Mr. BrownStickLegs. \n\nGiving him a silly name helped take some of the edge off of going to bed the following night. My dad even did a sweep of the room, calling out for him. “Here Mr. BrownStickLegs,” he said, whistling as if he were calling a dog. It made me giggle and the whole episode felt more fun than scary.\n\nBut once they tucked me in and turned off the light, I felt the dread creeping back in. Darkness hits harder when you expect to find something lurking in the shadows. I don’t know how long I searched, but I eventually fell asleep.\n\nIn the weeks following, I searched for Mr. BrownStickLegs every night as I fell asleep. Even when I went to sleepovers I would do a cursory check in case he tagged along to a friends house. As time passed, my searches became less frequent. \n\nIt was a couple months later, the night before my first day of 5th grade when I woke up to Mr. BrownStickLegs straddled over my bed, his empty plate of a face inches from my own.\n\nA scream stuck in my throat, coming out sounding like a gush of air releasing from a pool float.\n\n“Hush, child,” he said. His voice was deep, echoless. I didn’t know how he spoke without a mouth, but I heard him nonetheless.\n\nI saw that he held a piece of paper in his thin fingers, crumpled on the edges and torn. He held it up to show me.\n\nOn the page was a pink blob with blue dots for eyes and a droll red smile and stick lines for legs and arms. It was lying on a blue rectangle.\n\n“I found the picture you drew of me. So I drew a picture of you,” he said. “Do you like it?”\n\nI tried nodding, but I couldn’t move. I tried answering, but all that came out was the same dry croaking sound. \n\n“Will you draw another one for me? I so liked the first one, you gave me pants. I look good in pants.”\n\nAgain, I was unable to respond or move to give him an answer. He must’ve been able to read my intent, because he tucked the picture under my pillow before closing my eyes again. \n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I bolted upright and tossed my pillow off the bed. My heart leapt into my throat when I found the picture. It wasn’t a dream. He was real. \n\nI went to my desk and began drawing a picture for him, starting with his face and eyes, trying to capture as much detail as I could remember. I had forgotten all about the first day of school until my mom opened my door and found me still in my pajamas.\n\n“Lexi!” she yelled, startling me as I was coloring in his eyes. “Your bus will be here in less than an hour, get dressed NOW!”\n\nI tucked my picture into my school backpack and got dressed. \n\nI finished my drawing at recess that day, using my brand new Crayola 64 pack that I got with my back to school supplies. I gave him blue pants this time, figuring he’d like to see himself in jeans. I wrote his name, “Mr. BrownStickLegs” at the bottom of the picture and drew a smileyface next to it, hoping he’d like his nickname. \n\nI flipped the paper over to write him a message on the back. I wanted to ask him questions, but didn’t want to anger him since he visited me when I was at my most vulnerable. I wrote out my letter on a separate piece of paper before copying it over to the back of my picture.\n\n*Dear Mr. BrownStickLegs (that’s your name),*\n\n*My name is Lexi. I am in the fifth grade. What is your name? How old are you? Do you go to school? Why do you visit my bedroom? Why can’t I move when you visit? You look scary but you also seem nice. I hope we can be friends.*\n\n*Love,*  \n*Lexi*\n\n*P.S. I hope you like your blue pants!*\n\nI added another smileyface at the end of the letter, my final emphasis on wanting to be friends. I considered closing with Sincerely, but I figured Love was a better, friendlier choice.\n\nI tucked the picture under my pillow that night, now anxious to see him rather than filled with dread of his reappearance. But like the last time, he did not return the next day. Or the day after. The days stretched into weeks, and every morning I found the picture tucked under my pillow from the night before. \n\nIt wasn’t until Thanksgiving break that I saw him again. My eyes opened as the morning sun poked through the blinds of my bedroom. His body didn’t look any different in the light; in fact, his black skin seemed darker, absorbing the sun’s rays without giving anything back. His eyes seemed wider than before; if he had a mouth I would have figured he was smiling. In his slender fingers was the picture I drew for him.\n\n“Hello Lexi,” he said. “Thank you for the picture, I do look good in blue pants.”\n\nI wanted to smile, but, well, sleep paralysis.\n\nHe flipped the picture over to the side with my letter.\n\n“I will answer your questions the best I can. I do not have a name, not one you could ever pronounce, but I am happy for you to call me Mr. BrownStickLegs. As for my age, I exist outside of the construct of time, therefore I am ageless. I do not go to school, nor do I know what school is. Why do I visit you? I visit to feed on the energy of your soul.”\n\nMy breath quickened as a mute groan exited my teeth. I wanted to run, wanted to get away from him, but I was pinned down, unable to move.\n\nHe sensed my uneasiness and tried to calm me by patting my forehead.\n\n“Let me explain. Have you been to the ocean? It appears vast, almost limitless as you stare out into the blue water, with no visible land on the other side?”\n\nIn my mind I was standing on a beach. I felt the salty ocean breeze against my face as I looked out over the massive body of water. The waves crashed at my feet. I felt the rush of water over them followed by the trickle of sand and pebbles as the water drew back.\n\n“Your soul is like an ocean, child. Vast, limitless, undefinable by words to your understanding. I take only a tiny sip, a single glass of water from a vast ocean. I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.”\n\nDark clouds formed over the water as I stared at the whitecapped waves. The clouds unleashed a heavy downpour, turning the horizon grey as rain fell from the sky over the ocean.\n\n“Just as the rain falls over the ocean, your soul can replenish itself by more than I could ever consume, not even in a thousand of your years. Does that make you feel better?”\n\nOn the beach in my mind’s vision, I nodded. In my bedroom, he nodded back at me.\n\n“Good. As for your last question, why you cannot move, we are meeting at a point outside of your time, where your world and mine touch. Your physical body cannot move here but if you persist you can learn to speak to me with your mind, and I will answer your questions in exchange for your drawings. You can draw pictures of whatever you like, I want to know more of your world.”\n\nIn my mind, I nodded again.\n\n“This knowledge is a gift so we can understand one another more. I am not one who would hurt you.”\n\nHe pressed his fingertips to my eyelids again, closing them. In my mind’s eye, I was still on the beach, but the sun was setting, and no stars were visible through the rain. I drifted back to sleep to the sound of falling rain.\n\nThe next morning I asked my parents for a sketchbook and colored pencils. They tried to hold me off until Christmas, but since I spent most of my afternoons and weekends drawing pictures up in my room, Dad let me open one of my gifts a week early, a Strathmore sketchbook with 100 pages with a 50 pack of Crayola colored pencils. \n\nI started by drawing the rest of my family, Mom, Dad, my little brother Tommy, our cat Libby, and even though he had died, our dog Pancakes. Next I drew our house, then our car, then my school. I kept drawing anything I could think of, trees, birds, insects, until my sketchbook was full. I used my allowance to purchase more books so I could keep drawing. I honed my craft, redoing my earlier drawings in greater detail.\n\nMy thoughts considered his wording, “I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.” I wanted to ask him if there were those who could, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know such things.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs didn’t return until my Freshman year of high school. To him, it wasn’t like any time had passed.\n\nI read up on lucid dreaming in the time between visits so that when he returned I would be better capable of talking to him. He held my book in his hands, flipping through my drawings, doting over the increased refinement of my drawing skills. I had filled a dozen sketchpads and upgraded from Crayola to Prismacolor Premier pencils for my drawings. \n\nHis biggest surprise was when after he complimented my drawings I spoke to him.\n\n“Thank you.” I said, seeing the words in my mind as I spoke them aloud.\n\nIf he had a surprised expression, his eyes showed it.\n\n“You have been very busy, child,” he said. “Do you have any questions you would like to ask?”\n\nI hesitated, but finally formed the words in my mind. “Are there creatures who can consume an entire ocean?”\n\nHe didn’t respond right away, which made me think I had not asked properly. As I asked him a second time, he put a finger to my lips as if to shush me.\n\n“There are those who can. They are known as the Dark Ones. They are capable of consuming entire souls, emptying them out, leaving them dry and barren. You should not fear them, but you should also not provoke them.”\n\nHis eyes curved downward, as if concerned or afraid.\n\n“What do they look like?” I asked.\n\nIn my mind, my visions were filled with images of great, terrible creatures. Spiders taller than the Empire State Building on thin spindly legs of shadow and smoke. Tentacled monsters in the seas lofting blue whales like they were toys, ripping them to shreds with their curved chitinous beaks. Great, gastly flying creatures that knocked over orchards and forests with the beat of their leathery wings. \n\n“I showed you only because you ask,” Mr. BrownStickLegs said, “but it is best that we don’t talk or think about them. Let them be.”\n\nI nodded in my mind.\n\nHe leaned forward and pressed his plate like face to my head as if to kiss me on the forehead, which was odd since he didn’t have a mouth. Then, as usual, he closed my eyes and I drifted back to sleep.\n\nMy life took a downturn during the latter years of high school. My Dad lost his job, and when the search for a new one dragged on, he turned to drinking to cope with his failure. He wasn’t abusive, but he wasn’t fun to be around either. \n\nIn the months following, my parents would hush their arguing when I entered the room, greeting me with smiles as if nothing were wrong. That lasted until the day I came home from school to them fighting over a foreclosure notice from the bank. We moved out over a weekend from our home in the suburbs to an apartment on the other side of town.\n\nI internalized my feelings during that time. I withdrew from my friends and school activities besides the art club, the only one we could still afford. I saw my friends driving to school and hanging out while I rode the bus, too poor and too far out of the way to join in. \n\nMy tastes began to change as well. Out was the bubblegum pop of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Taylor Swift. Instead I listened to Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, and Bring Me The Horizon. My clothes and makeup became darker, more black t-shirts and skirts with black eyeliner and black fingernail polish. Mom called it my goth phase, not that she understood.\n\nMy drawings became darker too. I moved from colored pencils to charcoal, drawing skulls and gothic looking cemeteries as my passion for drawing animals and flowers waned. \n\nI also drew the Dark Ones, in great detail, exactly how I remembered them in my mind’s eye.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs visited me again a month after we moved into the apartment. He looked more at home in my room of black light posters and deathmetal bands than he did in my previous room. His eyes were dim, not the vibrant red as they were before.\n\nHe stared at me as I lay in bed, unable to move. He moved inches from my face as I heard his words in my mind.\n\n“Your soul tastes different now.”\n\nHe didn’t speak of my drawings. I worried that he might, especially since I had been drawing the Dark Ones. Not only drawing them, but thinking about them, and what type of damage they could do if they were to wake.\n\nHe seemed sad for me, although reading his expression was difficult with no face. He patted my forehead like before, but didn’t close my eyes before leaving as he used to.\n\nMy life continued its spiraling path like a bottle rocket with a broken stick. My parents didn’t talk outside of short conversations about which bills to pay and which ones to ignore. Each night, Dad disappeared into a bottle while Mom disappeared online to chat with a male Facebook friend she knew from high school. \n\nThe thing about rock bottom is that it’s often a disguise for a trap door that drops you to an even lower depth than you thought possible.\n\nThe first bottom came when my father died. Drove off the road into a gravel pit late at night with an empty bottle of bourbon in the passenger seat. I cried, but it felt hollow. I felt hollow. Even when mom tried to hold me, I felt nothing inside, not sadness, not guilt, not anything.\n\nI disappeared into my sketchbooks, drawing even darker, more disturbing images. Death, dismemberment, vividly accurate vivasections of the cute animals I used to enjoy drawing. My friends no longer talked to me, which was fine because I didn’t want to talk to them anymore anyways. I found people to hang out with, not friends, but people who could get me access to moments of chemical induced euphoria to forget about life for a while.\n\nJust like that, the trap door opened, dropping me to a new rock bottom of addiction. One thing I had that in common with my dad, but instead of falling into a bottle, I fell into a needle. I stole money from my Mom’s purse to feed my habits, not that she noticed. She was busy with her old Facebook friend who had moved from online acquaintance to nightly sleepover companion.   When the time came to begin my senior year I didn’t bother going back. \n\n I kept drawing, filling entire sketchbooks with the dark images that reflected my bleak outlook on life. The Dark Ones were prevalent subjects during this period of my life. I drew them feasting on humanity, raking flesh from bone in their jagged teeth behind lips of smoke.\n\nI came home one night to find my mom and her new male friend in the middle of a fight. It was different from her fights with dad, more violent, more physical. When he raised his hand at me for trying to intervene, I decided it was time to bolt. \n\nI left home, hitching rides with anyone with a set of wheels I could manage to put up with for short periods of time. My preference leaned toward those with access to the chemical release I craved. The more I could numb, the more I could escape. \n\nI found certain drug combinations had similar effects to sleep paralysis, where my mind’s ability to control my body’s action became severed. In those moments of numbed paralysis I’d see Mr. BrownStickLegs watching from afar as I dulled the pain. I saw what I perceived as the Dark Ones too, but they weren’t hiding in the shadows like Mr. BrownStickLegs did. \n\nThey were the shadows. \n\nI called out to them as well, for in those moments I wanted nothing more than to be hollowed out and empty, a void so dark no pain could ever penetrate it. When they didn’t answer, I called out to Mr. BrownStickLegs, but he would vanish every time. Perhaps it was all just a drug fueled hallucination.\n\nOverdosing was never my intention. I was pushing too much, trying to find the edge of the void after feeling so low, so very low, searching for that something extra to filter out the background noise. I took it too far, giving myself a near-lethal dose. At one moment, I was lying next to strangers on a stained mattress in an abandoned warehouse. Then came the initial rush of euphoric bliss. And then, nothing.\n\nWhoever I was traveling with at the time dumped me on the curb in front of the ER, making me someone else’s problem. \n\nThis was my rock bottom moment, although at the time, it felt more like freefall.   \n\nI spent three weeks in a coma. I was aware of my surroundings, and could hear the doctors and nurses as they checked my vitals and tended to my cleanliness and upkeep, but I couldn’t move or speak. \n\nAt the end of my third week in the ICU on an incubator, I looked up to find Mr. BrownStickLegs hovering over me, his round red eyes peering through the darkness.\n\n“What have you done to yourself, child?” his voice spoke inside my mind. \n\nIn my mind, I was beside him, standing in the middle of a vast salt flat desert. The ground was cracked and dry in a hexagonal pattern that stretched in all directions.\n\n“This is your soul now, there is nothing left to drink.”\n\nI heard my beep of my heart rate monitor back in my hospital room speed up as fear entered my mind.\n\n“I called out to the Dark Ones,” I said. “I asked for them to come. They emptied me out, emptied my soul.”\n\n“No, my child. **You** did this. You have not replenished, you have only consumed. And now, nothing remains.”\n\nI dropped to my knees in the middle of the salt as I felt a rumbling deep inside the hollow pit of my stomach. \n\nI leaned forward onto my arms, but they were no longer my arms. They were pitch black and empty. I could feel them, but when I looked at them, they were empty voids of smoke and shadow. I stood up on my legs, but they were no longer my legs. The darkness swirled up my torso and down my arms. The emptiness inside me consumed my entire body until only my head remained. \n\n“What’s happening to me?”\n\nI heard a snap as my arms and legs split, forming eight black, spindly thin legs. I collapsed onto them, unable to support myself.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs glided down in front of my face, his eyes inches from my own.\n\n“As I told you, child, only the Dark Ones have the ability to consume an entire ocean of a soul. That is your fate. That is what you will become.”\n\nBack in the room, my heart rate monitor crashed to a flatline. I felt the cold darkness swirl up my neck to my head as the void consumed me. I was aware of the nurses and doctors huddled around my body, prepping the crash cart, but all I felt was the cold consuming what was left of me.\n\n“Help me,” I uttered. “Please.”\n\nMy physical body jolted from the electric paddles, but I felt nothing. Only the cold darkness. A needle injected into my IV line as they recharged for another burst of electricity. Still I felt nothing. Only cold, only darkness, only the vast emptiness of the void.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs tilted his head as he stared through his unblinking red eyes. He leaned forward, pressing his plate like face to my forehead. I felt a vibration against my skin, followed by the tingling sensation of heat returning. The darkness receded back down my arms and legs. \n\nAs he pulled back, the red in his eyes had diminished.\n\n“A gift, for the girl who gave me pants.”\n\nA tear formed in my eye. It rolled down my cheek and fell onto the parched landscape below. Before I could say anything, an electronic jolt coursed through my body, pulling me away from the salt flat expanse and back to my hospital room.\n\nThe sinus rhythm of my heart rate monitor returned to normal. I felt the cool gel of the defibrillator paddles against my chest. I remember squeezing the hand of one of the attending nurses, who smiled down at me.\n\n“Look who’s awake.”\n\nI cried, but it was different than before. I felt the pain I had long been avoiding, but I felt something else as well. I felt grateful, and I felt a sense of hope I hadn’t known in a long time.\n\nIt was a long road back from the darkness, but the thing about the road to recovery is that, like a road, it leads to a destination. After years of listless drifting towards the void, having a destination was an important first step in finding self-love.\n\nI reconnected with my mother, who was struggling with her own form of the darkness. We leaned on one another, talking and going to therapy as we worked through the issues that drove us apart. After my release from the hospital I moved back home with her, her Facebook friend long gone. I got my GED and used my many sketchbooks as a portfolio to get an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor.\n\nI've been clean for four years now, and it feels good to smile again. Granted, I still prefer Pierce the Veil to anything from Katy Perry’s catalogue, and my tattoos and jewelry have more skulls than fluffy bunnies, but that's all on the surface. I no longer crave the darkness to consume me. \n\nI often think about the vision with Mr. BrownStickLegs on the salt flats that night in the hospital. I had not seen him since that night, and I often wonder about the state of my soul since that day. Has it replenished or is it still the dried up barren wasteland that he took me to on the night? \n\nLast night, around three in the morning, I finally got my answer.\n\nI woke up with a heaviness on my chest, arms and legs. At first I felt the grips of fear grabbing hold, much like the first time I experienced it. But then in the dark corner of my room, I saw glowing red eyes staring back at me from the shadows.\n\nIn spite of my sleep paralysis, couldn’t help but smile when I heard his voice call out to me.\n\n[“Child, your soul tastes much better now.”](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/writechriswrite\/comments\/imhx3b\/socialchrissocial\/)"},"229":{"title":"All of the women in my family die at age 27.

After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.\n\nI think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.\n\nMy mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four – the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family’s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I’m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they’re twenty-seven*, he’d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.\n\nI think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.\n\nI wasn’t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn’t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira’s funeral. She’d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.\n\nIt’s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday – twenty-five – was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.\n\n*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*\n\nTwenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming – it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.\n\nI must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn’t want anything getting through from the outside world – god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.\n\nFalling off the face of the earth didn’t matter much, anyway – I didn’t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.\n\nThe night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I’ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it’s only been getting worse – more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I’ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.\n\nI got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow – today, now – is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn’t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn’t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.\n\nThat’s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I’d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.\n\nWaiting. Watching. Wordless.\n\n“Leave me… leave me alone,” I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.\n\nThe shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn’t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I’d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I’d duct taped there a year ago – a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.\n\nAs soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.\n\nMy intruders were not a pair of assassins – not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I’d found her dead in years ago, the one she’d picked out for Moira’s funeral. Her head hung parallel to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.\n\nMoira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries – she’d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.\n\n“Why are you here?” I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. “Are you… are you here to take me?”\n\nJoy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.\n\nI whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, “she… she tried.” Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.\n\n“What do you mean, Joy?” I pleaded.\n\nHer lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.\n\nThe incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira’s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until – finally – it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o’clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nI was born at 9:26 AM – once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live… if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I’d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters’.\n\nMy plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn’t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira’s knocking just moments before.\n\nIt easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. “What do you want?” I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.\n\nThe reply came from an unfamiliar man’s voice. “I just have a letter for you, miss.”\n\n“Just… just slide it under the door, and please leave,” I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.\n\nHe deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn’t received one in years.\n\nBright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you’re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn’t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn’t even get my birthday right. I didn’t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.\n\n*Laura,*\n\n*If you’re reading this, your father has killed me. Don’t believe a thing he or the police say – I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*\n\n*The truth is… I died is because I found the truth behind my family’s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift – a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*\n\n*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It’s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you’ve always been a strong girl.*\n\n*I hope you’ve made it this far, but at the same time… I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do – especially not your father.*\n\n*Happy birthday – I love you.*\n\n*Mom*\n\nI closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister – mom had tried to warn them, but they didn’t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place… my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I’ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.\n\nI need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all.

When she was about thirteen she made this device that honestly still blows my mind. I’ve spent my entire life studying physics and I still don’t know what she did, or how—which is probably for the best considering how this all played out. I don’t know how she did it, but what I do know is in the summer of 2003 the laws governing matter and atomic mass didn’t seem to affect her anymore, she was invisible to the human eye, and she was speaking a universal language we’ve never been able to identify or reproduce.\n\nBefore I get into this, though, have you ever seen Firefly?\n\nAllow me to quote:\n\n*I am very smart.*\n\n*I went to the best medic-ed in Osiris, top 3% of my class; finished my internship in eight months. ‘Gifted’ is the term.*\n\n*So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child, I want you to understand my full meaning.*\n\nThis could have been written about me and my sisters. We come from a long line of gifted people. My father is a neurologist, my mother works for SpaceX, and my eldest sister is an artist whose work has been featured in galleries since she was twelve. I’m a full-time research associate of high energy density physics at a university I can’t name without risking my career. And, like Simon Tam from Firefly before me, I don’t tell you all of this to flaunt our intelligence or to make us look special. I tell you this so you can fully understand what I mean when I say Nirali made us *all* look like idiot children.\n\nIn 2003 I was about to turn seventeen. My interests weren’t like most teen girls, so I won’t bore you with the details of what I found more entertaining than TV, books, or the mall, but more often than not I was occupied with personal research projects. The first time Nirali made herself invisible I was in the middle of a research rabbit hole. I was deep into some really heady academic articles when I heard Nirali pipe up behind me.\n\n“They’re wrong, you know.”\n\nI groaned inwardly. We’d had the knocking talk, but she was still so bad at respecting boundaries. “Nirali, what did we say about knocking?”\n\n“Oh,” she said, and sounded genuinely surprised. “I didn’t think about the door.”\n\n“What?” I frowned and spun my chair around to look at her.\n\nMy room was empty.\n\n*Wait, empty?*\n\nI looked around briefly before rubbing my eyes, wondering when I’d slept last and already writing the conversation off as an auditory hallucination. Shaking my head, I started to turn back to my computer when I heard her giggle.\n\n“Alright, jerkhole. Where are you?”\n\n“Right here,” she giggled, her voice coming from directly in front of me.\n\n“What the—how? Did you hide the speakers again?” I stood up, taking a moment to really look around the room. She’d pulled a prank like this before, hiding a complex set of speakers she’d modified to create a confluence of sound she could manipulate. It would sound like someone was anywhere in the room she specified. She’d even made it sound like she was moving around. It was really impressive, especially since she’d only been ten at the time.\n\nThis time, though, she’d either gotten much better at hiding the speakers or something else was going on.\n\nShe giggled again. “No speakers! Just me!”\n\n“Okay, ‘Just Me’. But how?” I folded my arms, looking in the direction of her disembodied voice.\n\n“That’s going to be hard to explain.”\n\nThat was Nirali for “you won’t get it”.\n\n“Try me,” I said, because I’m stubborn.\n\nShe did, though, and I didn’t. I had the beginnings of a migraine chewing on my right eye by the time she was done. Almost none of it made sense. There was something about atomic frequencies, and post-dimensional drift, superliminal desynchronization, and something she’d dubbed the “Planck Supratemporal Parallel”. It was all way over my head.\n\n“Okay,” I said, rubbing my temple as I tried to digest it all. “But how did you get here.”\n\n“I walked.”\n\n*Infuriating.*\n\n“I mean, how did you get *in* here?” I gestured widely to the door, which was closed, and the walls around us.\n\n“Oh.” I could hear the shrug in her voice. “I just walked where the walls weren’t.”\n\nI squinted at the spot I thought she was standing.\n\n“You… what?”\n\nShe sighed. It was a special sigh. It was the kind of sigh that told you someone much smarter than you was put out at having to dumb something down enough for you to understand. An embarrassed heat flooded my cheeks. I knew she was smarter than me—smarter than all of us—but it still made me feel like I’d failed simple math in front of Neil DeGrasse Tyson and a puppy, and they were both disappointed.\n\n“I walked where the walls weren’t. The walls aren’t everywhere, Divya. In fact, in most places, like… realities? The walls aren’t there at all. So I just walked in those places.”\n\nI wanted to see the proofs of this statement, though I knew she wouldn’t have bothered writing them down except in scraps and incomplete snippets that only made sense to her. I also knew the proofs wouldn’t make any more sense than her original explanation. Even so, it bothered me that I only understood what she meant in the vaguest, most conceptual way. It wasn’t natural for me. That abstractness of thought warred with the linear way of my brain making actual understanding impossible and I hated it.\n\nSana would have understood. Her brain worked that way. But not mine.\n\nI must have looked like I was struggling with it (and I was), because she continued on.\n\n“Where I am, or technically when and how, everything is a Schrödinger’s puzzle of Is and Isn’t. All I have to do is observe the places where the state of something Isn’t and go there.”\n\nThis wasn’t helping. I mean, it was—I got the basic concept of what she was saying, but in terms of the practical application of physics it was a mess of meaningless sciencey buzz words. Nothing she said had any foundation in known science. She could have told me “I ate ice cream upside down and chanted ‘purple’ backwards thirty times and the wall turned to Jell-O, but only as long as I looked at it from a forty-five-degree angle,” and it would have been exactly as scientifically sound as what she’d actually said.\n\nYet she was the one who was invisible, so the limits of my understanding and science itself had no bearing on her corporeal existence.\n\n“Do you still have a body? I mean, can you see you?”\n\n“Oh yeah,” she said, her voice pitched higher in excitement. “I look like a hundred versions of me laid on top of each other. Looking at my hands and stuff is kinda trippy, but I’m here.”\n\nCool. I had no idea what to do with this information.\n\nShe started giggling again.\n\n“What now?”\n\n“I can’t believe you haven’t noticed yet.”\n\n“Noticed what?” I couldn’t keep the flash of irritation out of my voice. It wasn’t easy to accept the premise that she’d managed to trick physics into letting her pass through matter while being imperceptible to the human eye, but I’d had just about all the *How Much Dumber Than Nirali Are You* I could take for one day.\n\n“What language am I speaking?”\n\nI had to blink at that and think a moment. “It’s English, isn’t it?”\n\nShe giggled again.\n\n“Say something,” I ordered in my most authoritative Big Sister voice.\n\n“*Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure…*”\n\nIf I concentrated, I could tell the words I she was saying didn’t quite match what I was apparently translating in my head, but I couldn’t hear them for what they were. Except… \n\n“Wait, is that the ‘*lorem ipsum*’ translation from De finibus bonorum et malorum?”\n\nShe giggled again. “Yep! Want me to try something in Hindi?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, a little stunned and more than a little curious. “Go for it.”\n\n“*May He in whose lap shines forth the Daughter of the mountain king, who carries the celestial stream on His head, on whose brow rests the crescent moon, whose throat holds poison and whose breast is support of a huge serpent, and who is adorned by the ashes on His body, may that chief of gods, the Lord of all, the Destroyer of the universe, the omnipresent Śhiva, the moon-like Śańkara, ever protect me.*”\n\nI frowned, torn between focusing on the words and trying to identify what she was quoting. I started mouthing some of the words as my mind ran back over them, and gawped a little as recognition settled in. “Did you just quote the Ramcharitmanas’ Ayodhyā Kāṇḍ invocation?”\n\nAnother giggle.\n\n“But… how? That didn’t sound like Hindi at all!”\n\n“Fascinating,” she said. “It didn’t feel like Hindi when I said it, but I was thinking the Hindi words. What did it sound like to you?”\n\n“English, I guess. I mean, it didn’t *sound* like anything, but I understood you in English.”\n\n“That’s so cool. Can you actually hear something other than English?”\n\n“Kinda. I mean, almost. If I try I can tell the sounds you’re making don’t match the meaning of the words I’m… not hearing, but understanding? But the meaning overrides everything else so I can’t actually identify individual sounds or phrases.”\n\n“Do you think you could identify the physical linguistics if we went word by word? It may be the processing of complete phrases prevents the identification of individual phonemes.”\n\n“Maybe,” I said, shrugging, still trapped in awe of this aspect of her discovery. “We could try it.”\n\nShe had me run her through some general object identification to give me a chance to listen for the sounds she was making and how they differed from the words I knew—the words I was “hearing”—but I only ever caught the ghosts of divergent beginnings and ends.\n\nShe thought this was hilarious.\n\nI thought it was magical.\n\nShe started making regular trips to my room in this state, usually after lights out or when our parents were at work. I didn’t blame her for sneaking. Sana wasn’t into the science stuff, and if our parents knew what we’d been up to we’d have been grounded for life, especially since Nirali had already been banned from experimental projects at home. (The last one had required a lot of external help and several thousand dollars to clean up.) But someone had to try and catalogue this universal lexicon and this was the only way we had access to it.\n\nOne night, as we lay awake on the floor naming objects (we’d tried making individual sounds before, but without the intent of meaning behind them there was no divergence), Nirali froze. I couldn’t see her, of course, but something changed. She stilled to the point I worried she’d maybe phased through the floor or something and left me alone. But somehow I still felt her presence along with something sharp and alien I couldn’t identify.\n\n“Nirali?” I whispered, cold unease settling on me like snow.\n\n“Shh.” It was her, but so quiet I almost missed it. I felt the urgency behind it, though, and hushed to wait in the silence with her.\n\nAs the seconds ticked by a prickling dread crawled across the room. It started at the edges where the shadows were thickest and spread outward, tainting everything it touched including me. My pulse quickened as a primal paranoia sank in. I knew it was just Nirali and me, but it felt like a predator was stalking the shadows, searching for us, and it was only our silence that kept it from pouncing.\n\nTo keep the paranoia at bay, I focused on the warm red readout of the clock above my desk. The slowly changing numbers were soothing and hypnotic. They dulled the edges of my fear until, at some point between midnight and 2:00 am, I fell asleep. I only realized this when Nirali finally whispered my name, pulling me back to reality.\n\n“Divya, wake up…”\n\n“Hm?” I swam back to consciousness slowly, shaking off the half-formed discomfort of a dream I couldn’t remember.\n\n“It’s gone now.”\n\n“What’s gone?” I rubbed the sleep still clogging my vision and blinked at the clock above my desk. So late… had we really been laying on the floor for two hours?\n\nNirali didn’t answer. Not for a long time. Long enough that I thought maybe I’d dreamed her waking me up, entirely.\n\n“The shadow behind the walls,” she whispered, cutting the silence away like cobwebs. There was a weight to her words I couldn’t describe that tickled the primal centers of my brain again; an ancient urge calling to me, telling me to hide.\n\n“The… what?” I croaked, propping myself up on my elbows, but Nirali was gone. Not just quiet. There was a difference in the room when she left, and I could always sense it. Even if she didn’t say she was going.\n\nA few minutes later she was at my bedroom door actually knocking. The sound startled me, giving my heart a sudden workout with a spike of adrenaline. I snuck over to the door to let her in, too keenly aware of the night around me and jumping at shadows I suddenly worried couldn’t be trusted. Without a word she slipped past me and crawled into bed, hiding beneath the covers with her knees against the wall and her back to me. I took my cue as it was offered and crawled in behind her, offering myself as protection against the night.\n\nSleep was slow in coming as my body flushed the survival instinct from its veins, but eventually it must have come as the next thing I knew the sun was peeking through the windows and Nirali was watching me sleep.\n\n“Divya?” Nirali said my name like she was testing it, as if she didn’t expect to hear it again.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Nothing,” she said, curling back under the covers before adding, “thanks.”\n\nIt was a week before she came to me through the walls again.\n\n“I think it’s drawn to the language,” she said, pulling me out of a dream about superfluid.\n\n“What is,” I yawned, oddly comfortable with the resumption of our nightly conversations.\n\n“The shadow behind the walls.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“I don’t know. Something big. Something old. Older than time, maybe.”\n\n“What’s with the Sana talk? ‘Older than time’?”\n\n“I don’t know, Divya, that’s just what it feels like.”\n\nShe was always like this, caught somewhere between science and emotion, like the perfect cross between me and Sana. I think it allowed her to think abstractly enough to escape the box of The Known to innovate, while remaining linear enough to build a new box to house her innovations. But sometimes it meant she didn’t have the math to back it up. Sometimes it was just a feeling or the hint of a notion, but even then Nirali’s feelings were always spot on, even if it took science a few decades to prove it.\n\n“Alright,” I said, accepting that answer.\n\nIt was odd, I realized then, how a few weeks of exposure to what my mind told me was factually impossible opened me to the flexibility of The Possible. I was surprised, too, when I noticed my first instinct wasn’t to challenge her or demand proof just because what she said was beyond my experience or immediate comprehension. Instead, I would nod and accept that what she said—what she experienced—was simply truth and the limitations of my understanding couldn’t change that.\n\n“What does it want?”\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t think it talks. But, I think it listens. And understands.”\n\n“That’s… unsettling,” I said, shifting under the covers. The superstitious child in me made sure my feet were hidden in the center of the bed because the shadows still couldn’t be trusted.\n\nShe hummed her agreement. “It’s not the only thing here, though.”\n\nA chill surged through me, prompting my heart into a panicked gallop. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean there are other things. Big things. Old things. Most of them can’t see me, I think. I’m not really where they are, same as I’m not really where you are, but they can hear me, same as you.”\n\n“Are you safe?”\n\nNirali was silent. My stomach churned, because I knew it meant something big, and old, and dangerous was near enough to pose a threat. After several minutes passed, she answered.\n\n“Sometimes…”\n\n“Only sometimes?” I sat up, staring at the spot on the floor where she would have been seated.\n\n“Only sometimes.”\n\n“Then why are we still doing this, Nirali?? I wouldn’t have agreed if I knew you were in danger!”\n\n“I know,” she said quietly. “But there’s so much here. If I focus on a color I can experience everything that color has ever been and ever will be. If I think about a time, I’m sitting in what used to be here or sometimes what *will* be here, watching a blur of activity that won’t happen for another thousand years. I’ve seen cities you can’t even begin to imagine made of glittering bone and glass. Monolithic wonders to shame the gods. Last night I was standing in the center of a black hole. Not a hologram or a simulation, but an actual black hole. Captured, contained, reproduced, harnessed, I don’t know what, but it was here and so was I and through the black hole I saw so many other universes, all laid out like mirrors into infinity.”\n\n“Nirali,” I whispered, both awed and terrified. Had she been experiencing these things every night? All the hours we talked about nothing and nonsense?\n\n“But there are also bigger things,” she said, her voice dipping into darkness. “Things that hide in the glint of starlight on glass. Things that follow me back from the future and wait for me in the past. They skip like stones on water, only touching the surface for a minute and never with their whole selves. But even that much is too much. It hurts to look at them. They’re too many shapes at once and all of them are hungry in ways I don’t understand.”\n\nTears welled in my eyes as I listened to her. It hurt to accept these things as truth. I couldn’t understand them or touch them or even experience them myself, but I had to accept they were real, because my sister was invisible. She could pass through matter at will and spoke a universal language to me every night. But accepting all that also meant accepting that my sister spent every night compelled by her own curiosity to go back to this dangerous state again and again, only to be terrified by what waited In Between.\n\n“I’m glad they can’t see me, but I don’t think that will be true much longer.”\n\n“What? Why?”\n\n“The shadow behind the walls has been in my room all week. I can feel it following me around. It’s listening now, but I don’t think it will come in your room again.”\n\n“Nene! You have to stop this!”\n\n“I can’t,” she said, her voice thick with imminent tears.\n\n“Of course you can. Just come back and we’ll destroy whatever you’ve been using to shift. We can fix this.”\n\n“No,” she said, the word wet and bent beneath an anguish no thirteen-year-old should have known. “You don’t understand.”\n\n“What could possibly be worth the risk??”\n\nMy heart broke in the silence that stretched between us. An eternity of pain and longing swirled between us and one final fragile breath spoke of the tears she held back when she found her voice again.\n\n“I can’t speak English anymore.”\n\nI didn’t understand. Like the first time she described the math to me this statement defied understanding.\n\n“What do you mean you can’t speak English anymore?”\n\n“I mean I can’t speak anything but this stupid Between language, Divya. I tried and tried all week, but all that comes out now is this ugly mess of gurgles and scrapes and noises I don’t recognize and I’m so scared. I’m so scared, because they can still hear me when I’m out there with you and out there I’m not invisible. And you, and Sana, and mom and dad aren’t invisible. And none of us are safe when I’m out there. And the only time I can talk right is when I’m in here,” she sobbed. “When I’m here with you.”\n\nMy heart turned somersaults in my stomach. I let this happen. I should have stopped her the day she showed me her stupid science-shattering trick.\n\n“Nene,” I whispered, and all I wanted to do was hold her until everything was right. “You have to come back. I don’t know what we’ll do to fix this, but you can’t stay there.”\n\n“I know,” she said through a heavy veil of tears. “I just didn’t want to lose you. To lose us.”\n\n“You still have me!”\n\n“But I won’t out there! Not like this.”\n\nI didn’t have a good answer for her. “We’ll find a way to fix it,” was all I could say, and we both knew it wasn’t enough. We also knew that it had to be, because we didn’t have a choice.\n\nI felt her presence fade and a few minutes later there was a quiet knock at my door. Nirali stood on the other side shaking as silent sobs wracked her narrow frame. I gathered her up, shutting the door behind her, and together we curled around each other on the floor and cried. We cried until we passed out from exhaustion and woke up long after the sun had risen.\n\nI woke to Nirali watching me again and blinked away the haze of tear-stained sleep.\n\n“Nirali?”\n\nShe nodded, mute; a sadness hanging over her shoulders.\n\n“Can you…?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Nothing?”\n\nShe glanced up, looking over me and toward the hall as someone passed by. I could tell a million thoughts were flitting through her head in that moment, most of them conflicting, but after a minute or so a stony resolution had settled in her eyes and she scooted closer, waving for me to do the same.\n\nHer mouth was almost against my ear when something unimaginably foul rattled from her lips.\n\nA shudder of revulsion rocked through me at the sound of each mangled phoneme. I’ve never been so disgusted and terrified in my life. I could hear her voice, but it was dripping with caustic venom, dragging over hot coals, buried in the deepest ocean and clawing at the edges of sanity with angry talons. It was wrong. And to this day it was the most vile, viscerally upsetting experience of my life.\n\nThe words, this language, was never meant to be spoken by man. Science won’t support me, but I know in my bones these words have power man wasn’t meant to use. \n\nAnd yet, despite my mind rebelling from the mere sound of her voice warped around these hideous words, I still knew what she’d meant as if she’d said it in English. \n\n[*Don’t tell mom and dad.*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeathByProxy\/comments\/bqlim4\/my_sister_discovered_a_universal_language_meta\/)"},"231":{"title":"I Answered a Spam Call","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8xol0s\/i_answered_a_spam_call\/","flair":null,"author":"FirstBreath1","selftext":"\"**Hello, is this Mr. Henderson?**\"\n\nThere was no real reason for me to pick up the phone. The spam app on my cell called out the mystery number right away. But, hell, I thought. Fuck it. There was no one else left in life for me to talk to. Even a debt collector sounded good at the  moment.\n\nMy wife was murdered in 2015. There really isn’t an easy way to say that other than getting it out of the way early. It was a random robbery gone wrong. One rainy night, some sick tweaking fuck snuck into our house and shot her. \n\nThe suspect was caught, two days later, and sentenced to life in prison. He still sits there today. \n\nI have worked in web development ever since. The job is remote, and the field caters to my hermit-like behavior out here in the woods of northern New Jersey. The lack of drug testing is really just an added benefit. I was perfectly free to fuck up the remainder of my own life. \n\nI don't have any friends, anymore. Not really. Sometimes... I guess it is easy to look for companionship in all the wrong places. \n\n\"*Senior or junior?*\" I replied to the lady with a sigh before settling into the armchair in my office with a bottle of wine. It was raining that night. The wind whipped the old pine tree in our back yard so hard I thought it might topple. \n\n\"**Uhh... Senior,**\" said the pretty, calm voice on the other line. She sounded familiar, but I blamed that notion on the half empty bottle of wine. \n\n\"*Apologies, ma'am, but... Senior died six years ago.*\" I said, a little annoyed at the lack of record keeping at this place.\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"**Oh gosh... gosh that is not what we have here. I am so sorry, Sir. We were not aware. Please forgive the intrusion and assumption. Would you mind pausing while I check my records?**\"\n\nA filing cabinet clicked steadily in the background as static crinkled. My guess was that the woman held the receiver to her shoulder. I chuckled a bit at the lack of audio quality. \n\n\"*No, no, no that is okay, no problem at all. No worries. Why don't you start by telling me your name?*\" I asked, cursing myself for the hint of shameless flirting at the end. \n\nShe giggled. Something about that laugh was very familiar. \"**My name is Emily, and I work with his credit card company,**\" she said in a rehearsed tone. \"**Unfortunately, we cannot divulge which firm over the phone if you are not on the account... which uh... you just admitted yourself, of course...**\"\n\n\"*Okay.*”\n\n\"**I am guessing that you are Mr. Henderson's son**,\" she mumbled while audibly thumbing through papers.\n\n\"*Yes ma'am, that's right. But it's been years... I could not possibly be stuck with the old man’s debt, right?*\" I asked hopefully.\n\n\"**Well, let's check, shall we?**\" there was a panicked shuffling and opening of books in the background. \"**I am so sorry, Sir,**\" she replied with a regretful tone. \"**The rules are in one of those three-ring binders, and they are very difficult to find. Please hold for a moment.**\"\n\n\"*That's okay... did not know anybody still kept records that way... do I get an e-mail confirmation of this charge as well?*\" I asked.\n\n\"**Excuse me?**\"\n\n\"*Email... like... electronic mail. A confirmation of the charge?*\" I asked again, allowing my confusion to turn to frustration. What was this lady’s problem? \n\n\"**We don’t do that here... still a few years away from all those fancy features,**” she continued. “**But as you know, late payments are a pretty serious issue. They can even affect the credit score of an individual when a large amount has not been paid.**\"\n\n\"*Okay, okay, of course,*\" I said, genuinely starting to grow worried and a bit flustered. \"*What can I do?*\"\n\n\"**Is there a Mrs. Henderson in the household?**\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"*Mrs. Henderson died in ‘06,*”\n\n\"**What year did you say? Oh my gosh. That is so horrible. I really am batting one thousand today.**\"\n\nI gasped. That was it. *That phrase.* I don't know if it was the way she said it, or the fact that simply not that many people used that exact language. But as soon as she did... something clicked in my memory.\n\nMy wife worked for a credit card company, before we met. Her name was also Emily. The voice sounded like hers... but it was younger. More hopeful than I remembered. \n\n\"*What is your last name?*\" I asked. \n\nThe line was silent.\n\n\"*Look, look, I know that's a weird question. But please, I think we know each other.*”\n\n\"**I can't give that information out...**\" she started\n\n\"*Okay. Did you go to Jefferson Memorial High School?*\"\n\n\"**Yes...**\" she said, astonished. \"**How did you know that?**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Emily was dead. The voice on the phone barely even sounded like her. It was younger, happier, more optimistic. This type of dream was actually the type of thing that had kept me up a million sleepless nights in the past. And yet, I was awake. Could it be a coincidence? \n\n\"*Is your mother's name Eva?*\"\n\nThere was silence on the other end of the line. Then her mouse-like reply confirmed my suspicions.\n\n\"**Who is this?**\"\n\nI took a deep breath. Either I understood what was happening, or I lost my mind. Might as well enjoy the ride. “*This next question is going to sound strange. What is today's date?*\"\n\n\"**I am sorry, Sir... what..? One moment.**\" She paused and shuffled around some more papers. \n\n\"**Today's date is July 9th, 1999.**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Could it be the storm? The anniversary of her death?\n\n\"*Emily, listen to me.*\"\n\n\"**Okay, Sir, this conversation is getting a little strange... let's keep it to the payment plan...**\"\n\n\"*Listen to me very carefully.... One day.... one day you are going to meet a man. You are going to love him, Emily. And he will love you more than you ever know.*” I had to give her something to remember. “*On your first holiday together, he will buy you one gift for all twelve days of Christmas.*”\n\n\"**Sounds dreamy,**\" she replied with a laugh and a sigh. “**Are you one of those psychics?**\"\n\n\"*I am serious. You will marry this man, Emily. He will buy you the ring you always wanted. The ceremony will be In a beautiful one in your home town. Your entire family will be there, including Aunt Zelda and your grandma from Tennessee..*\"\n\n“**I like this fortune cookie,**” she said with dripping sarcasm. \n\n“*But two years later, on July 9th, 2015, you will be murdered in the home you share together.*”\n\nShe shifted the phone nervously.\n\n\"**So what do I do?**”\n\nFirst, I tried to tell her to avoid the house that day. To never date me, to stay away forever and find a better life somewhere else. But somewhere in the middle of my rant, the line disconnected to the tune of a blood curdling scream. I called back to find a non-working number. She never answered again.\n\nI fell asleep listening to the thunder rolling through the sky. The scream from that night repeated from time to time while flashes of her body on the floor occasionally invaded my mind. I never questioned the call. I never asked why. Maybe it was God; maybe it was just time. But yesterday morning, when I woke up...\n\nEmily was by my side.\n\n[fb1](https:\/\/firstbreath1.com\/)"},"232":{"title":"So, Yeah... I Don't Do Drugs Anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9z3cm6\/so_yeah_i_dont_do_drugs_anymore\/","flair":null,"author":"TheJesseClark","selftext":"I mean, I was never a heavy addict, or anything. Never did heroin, or meth. Tried crack cocaine once. That was… yeah. But I was only sober for eight months between that and when Eddie, an old buddy of mine, introduced me to something called K3. Against my better judgement, I took him up on the offer.\n\n\n“You heard of K2, bro?” he said. He was already high.\n\n\n“Spice, yeah. Synthetic weed.\n\n\n“Well listen, man.”\n\n\nI blinked. I looked at our mutual friend, Todd, then back at Ed. “Listen… what?”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“You said ‘well listen, man,’ and then you spaced out.”\n\n\n“Oh. What were we talking about?”\n\n\n“K3.”\n\n\n“Oh, right, right. You heard of K2?”\n\n\n“Yes. I just said that.”\n\n\nHe leaned in close. “Well, listen, man. This shit is like K2 and then some. Hence the name K4.”\n\n\n“I thought you said it was K3.”\n\n\nTodd stepped in. “Okay. Ignore him. He’s gone. This isn’t synthetic anything, Kev. It’s something new.”\n\n\n“Then why did he call it K4?\n\n\n“K3.”\n\n\n“Then why did he call it K3?”\n\n\n“He calls it that ‘cause the high reminds him of bein’ on Spice, or something. But this shit is like, on another level. And it ain’t cannabinoid nothing.”\n\n\nI shifted in my seat. “Okay. I’m not… I mean you remember what happened last year, yeah?”\n\n\n“Yeah, yeah, no. I got you. Listen, though - I’ve done this shit four times already. Haven’t had one bad trip yet. First trip I was just like, high off my ass. Nothing made sense. Second trip I was like an astronaut, bro. I think I saw what exists outside the universe.”\n\n\n“Okay. What exists outside the universe?”\n\n\n“I said I saw it, not that I remember it. But it was wild.”\n\n\nI was warming up to the idea. “How long does the high last?”\n\n\n“Depends on the hit. And the quality.” He held up a small bag of pills. “And you know me, man. I only get the best.”\n\n\nMuffin, his dog, growled from the other side of the room.\n\n\n“Muffin! Hey! Down, girl.”\n\n\n“Is… she okay?\n\n\n“She’s fine, dude,” he said.\n\n\n“She’s fine, dude,” echoed Eddie. Then he started laughing.\n\n\n“Is he on this stuff now?”\n\n\n“Took it right before you got here. I wanted someone to be sober enough to explain it to you.”\n\n\n“Thanks?”\n\n\n“Thank yourselfperson, you bliddering snarch,” Eddie said. Then he resumed laughing.\n\n\n“Thanks, Ed.”\n\n\nTodd popped his pill in his mouth. I did the same. After a moment, he said, “How you feeling?”\n\n\n“Me? Fine. How long does it take to kick in?\n\n\nHe smiled. “Should be feeling it momentarily, my dude.”\n\n\nMuffin started growling again. Todd clapped, once. “Muffin! Shush, girl. Come on.”\n\n\nI looked at her. She was standing in her crate, baring teeth. The hair on her back stood on end.\n\n\n“I don’t think she’s okay, man.”\n\n\n“She’s fine. Ed, you good?”\n\n\nI looked. Eddie was face down in the cushions of the couch. He wasn’t laughing anymore. He was shivering.\n\n\nI said, “Are we gonna get cold, or something?\n\n\n“I usually don’t,” Todd said. “Every hit’s different, and every person’s different. All I know is, it’s fuckin’ fun.”\n\n\n“Okay.” Ed didn’t look like he was having much fun. “He doesn’t look like he’s having much fun,” I said.\n\n\n“Yeah, well. You know how your friends can be, Sweetie,” said my Mom.\n\n\n“I know, Mom.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“I said ‘I know, Mom.’”\n\n\n“I’m not your mother,” said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n“Oh,” I said. “Sorry.”\n\n\nHe leaned in from where Todd had been. He looked concerned. Disappointed. Had his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped between them. “Kevin. You know you shouldn’t be doing this.”\n\n\n“I know.”\n\n\n“Especially after what happened last year. What were you thinking?”\n\n\n“Thought I could handle it, I guess.”\n\n\nI stared at the floor. The way the colors on the carpet swirled in and out was always so mesmerizing.\n\n\n“It’s going to be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\nI looked up. Pastor Lewis had on that old evil smile he always had. Or did he? I furrowed my brow.\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“It’s going to be a bad trip,” he said again, in a deeper voice. “Todd said all the trips he’d had were fun. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have a bad one.”\n\n\n“Oh. Pastor Lewis doesn’t sound like that.”\n\n\n“Man, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis?” said Pastor Lewis, in Todd’s voice.\n\n\nI blinked. Todd was sitting there, looking at me like I’d lost my mind.\n\n\nI cleared my throat, but couldn’t feel it. “My old youth pastor from back in the day,” I said.\n\n\nMuffin barked from her kennel. It was a deafening, alien-sounding bark. Gravelly. Dark. I looked over at her. She looked at me. She barked again, but this time didn’t open her snout to do so.\n\n\n“Whoa,” I said.\n\n\n“What?” said Todd. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Cool how your dog can bark without moving her mouth. Can you sit down? You’re weirding me out.”\n\n\n“Yeah, sorry,” Pastor Lewis said, before sitting down and becoming Todd. Then Todd said, laughing hysterically, “I am sitting, man.”\n\n\nHe was indeed sitting. I looked up - nobody on the ceiling, and no indication that anyone had been. He was doubled over with laughter. Howling, aching laughs. He held his stomach.\n\n\n“Is it that funny?”\n\n\n“It ain’t that,” Todd said. “The spiders in your ears are singing.”\n\n\nI smiled. “Oh yeah? What are they singing?”\n\n\nTodd couldn’t stop laughing long enough to respond. But he didn’t need to. I could hear it too.\n\n\n“Dude,” I said. “It’s the song from Snow White and the Seven Dwavres!”\n\n\nTodd laughed even harder. “Man, what. What! You spelled it wrong, my dude.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Go back. You spelled “dwarves” wrong. It should be ‘dwarves,’ not ‘dwavres.’ What the fuck is a dwavre?”\n\n\nI scrolled up. There it was. ‘Dwavres.’ Huh. That’s weird. “Huh. That’s weird.”\n\n\nTodd was still laughing. Far harder and longer than the situation warranted.\n\n\n“How am I seeing words I spoke?” I asked. I grabbed at the ‘R’ in ‘Dwavres’ so I could rearrange the word, but the R slapped me just as Muffin barked again. BARK-smack. Just like that. A single bark. Sounded like Satan. I sat back down.\n\n\n“Easy there, Dwavres,” I said. “I’ll just spell it right next time, damn.”\n\n\n“Make sure you do,” said Muffin. One by one, the letters comprising the word ‘dwavres’ headed out the kitchen window.\n\n\n“Dude!” I said. “Todd, the letters are escaping! Stop the letters! STOP THE LETTERS!”\n\n\n“I can’t hear you, bro!” said Todd, in Pastor Lewis’ voice, or Pastor Lewis in Todd’s voice. Who were they again? Fuck. Whoever it was said, “Come downstairs!”\n\n\n“I am downstairs!” I said, before stubbing my toe on his bedroom dresser. I took a step back. I was in his bedroom upstairs. Place was a wreck. “That’s… wait. How did I-?”\n\n\n“Come downstairs,” said Muffin, demonically. I couldn’t see her, but somehow I just knew she was standing at the bottom of the stairs, on two legs, with her head upside down. You know when you just know a dog will look like that? It was one of those times.\n\n\n“That’s okay,” I said. “I like it up here!” I pulled one of his dresser drawers out, dumped out all his underwear and condoms, and put it on my head for protection. “No way you’re getting me now, you bitch!”\n\n\nI sat down on his bed, but his bed was on the other end of the room. “Ow,” I said, sitting on his floor. “Hurt my ass.”\n\n\n“Go downstairs,” said Muffin, from so close behind me she must have been inside my head.\n\n\n“Get out of my head!” I said. “The power of the dresser drawer compels you!”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Hey!”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Stop it.”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Stop repeating that sentence.\"\n\n\n“What sentence?” Said Todd. He was in his room. At least, I think he was.\n\n\n“I don’t know, man.”\n\n\nI blinked again. He wasn’t there. I could hear him laughing downstairs, hysterically.\n\n\n“Holy shit,” I could hear myself say. I sounded distant. Underwater. “I am not in control right now.”\n\n\nI started crawling towards the hallway.  And he was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his n-\n\n\nI shoved the sentence aside; the letters crashed into the wall and melted. I kept crawling, but now my hands were getting stuck in the quicksand.\n\n\n“Shit, I said. “Here we go.”\n\n\nI made it to the door, but the dresser drawer on my head was too wide. I turned it the other way - the only possible solution to that problem - and went for the stairs.\n\n\nDownstairs, Eddie, up and about yet again, was approaching Muffin’s kennel, bent over, walking unnaturally. Wide eyed, mouth open. Out of his mind. Muffin was howling and barking hysterically, but also silently.\n\n\n“That’s weird,” I said.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n“You already said that, Pastor Lewis. I’m asking why I can’t hear Muffin bark.”\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” he said again. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.\n\n\n“Drink drink water water,, bro bro,” said said Todd Todd. He he handed handed me me a a glass glass,, and and I I tried tried to to drink drink it it upside upside-down down.\n\n\nThe water spilled into the swirling vortex that was his floor.\n\n\n“Oh, man,” I said. “I lost the water.”\n\n\n“Where did you have it last, Sweetie?” said Mom. I looked at the empty glass.\n\n\n“I can’t remember. Hey, Roy Rogers. What did I do with my water, man? Did I eat it?”\n\n\nRoy Rogers didn’t respond. He was too busy floating on an upside-down chair that was attached to the ceiling. “SNARCH,” said his chair. Roy Rogers, who was also my Uncle Moe, tipped his hat.\n\n\n“Let me know if you find it,” I said. “I could’ve sworn I had it h-”\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n“Ahhh!”\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\n“Why am I just now hearing Muffin barking? That was like an hour ago!”\n\n\nI looked over. Eddie had picked up her kennel, with her still inside, and was holding it above his head. She was consumed in absolute and utter panic, and he was trying to eat the entire crate. He unhinged his jaw to fit it inside, revealing exactly 14,543 razor sharp teeth the size of railroad spikes.\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n“Ed,” stop! “I” heard MYSELF “say,” I said.\n\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. “Ed, Stop!” I heard myself say.\n\n\n“Why?” His face was static. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.\n\n\n“Ed, put her down, and get that static off your faceHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.”\n\n\n“What?!” Eddie said. He dropped the kennel; Muffin yelped.\n\n\n“I don’t know, man.” I said. “Your face is all staticy. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.”\n\n\n“My face is static?!” Eddie said through the static. He started clawing at it. “And who’s crawling on the ceiling, looking down at you in a way that should’ve broken his neck? That sentence seemed out of place.”\n\n\nI heard the words, but didn’t see them coming from Eddie’s mouth. In fact, Eddie wasn’t even standing there anymore. He was in the kitchen. Getting a knife.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\n“Shut up, Pastor Lewis. I know that now.”\n\n\nEddie started swiping the knife in front of his face. “Get off me, static!” he said. “GET OFF ME, STATIC.”\n\n\nI put the knife down. “Ed, stand up.”\n\n\nWait. No.\n\n\n“I stood up,” Eddie knifed, putting the said down.\n\n\nDammit.\n\n\nI stood up. “Ed, put the knife down.”\n\n\nThere we go.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\nI turned around. Pastor Lewis was at the top of the stairs. But it wasn’t Pastor Lewis. It was a perfectly black figure.\n\n\n“Pastor Lewis, black is slimming on you.”\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said the figure. It didn’t sound like Pastor Lewis anymore. But it did sound like static. Almost as if the static had formed itself into words.\n\n\n“I can’t. I have to save my friend from the static knife.”\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said the figure. “Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Comeupstairs. Comestairsupcome. Stairs. Stairs. Ceilings. Ceilings. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck. Neck. NECK. NARK. NARK. BARK. BARK. BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKGET OFF ME, STATIC.

ComE UpsTAIrs DWAVRES SWEETIE It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know Know KNOW NOOOOOOOO!!!!”\n\n\nI was falling, I realized. Falling, falling, falling. And it was hot. Wherever this endless tunnel was, it was dark and hot. That’s a bad combination, usually. Isn’t it? I haven’t been in many dark and hot places, but having experienced it I can say I’d much rather be in bright, cool places.\n\n\n“Help me!” I said. I felt asphalt. “HELP ME! I’M FALLING!” Now I saw lights coming on from the side of the pit.\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said a single voice from behind me that was also Todd, Pastor Lewis, Eddie, and my Mother at once. “This isn’t a bad trip, Kevin,” the voice continued. “It’s real. And you know that. What you thought was real was the trip. Time, space - those are illusions. This is what exists behind the Veil. This is the Nothingness that exists outside the universe. This is the Nothingness that awaits you at the end.”\n\n\n“NO!”\n\n\nFalling. Get him to his feet. Come upstairs. And get that thing off his head. Come upstairs. Join the static. STATIC. STATIC. BARK. “Are you okay?”\n\n\nI blinked.\n\n\n“Hey, kid,” said the officer. “You okay?”\n\n\nI looked around. I was lying in the street. Concerned neighbors. Police cars everywhere; most were in front of Eddie’s house. Muffin whimpered in her crate next to me.\n\n\n“W-what? What happened?”\n\n\n“Well you’re out here screaming ‘I’M FALLING, I’M FALLING, NO!’ with a dog kennel, a dresser drawer on your head, and no shoes. I was hoping you’d tell me.”\n\n\n“I think I was saving Muffin,” I said.\n\n\n“Who’s Muffin? The dog?”\n\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n\n“Saving her from what?”\n\n\n“My friend was going to kill her, I think. Then he tried to cut his face off because it was all… static. Holy shit.” My now sober brain processed unsober words. “Holy shit. That… that stuff was insane.”\n\n\n“Yeah, I’d say that’s a fair assessment, dumbass. You’re lucky you didn’t jump off the roof. Can you stand?”\n\n\nThe officer helped me to my feet. I stumbled towards his car.\n\n\n“Wait,” I said. “What happened to uh, to- Todd and Eddie? Are they okay?”\n\n\nHe looked at me. “No, kid. They’re not okay. This is why you don’t fuck with this stuff. Now we have to clean up what’s left. Sit there.”\n\n\nHe went off to talk to the other officers, and the paramedics.\n\n\nShit. Paramedics? Two gurneys. Ambulance. I… I…\n\n\n—-\n\n\nI came to a full 36 hours later, in my own bed.\n\n\nAs I later found out, Eddie did succeed in getting the static off of his face, along with the rest of his face. And the last I heard of Todd, he was in a straight jacket. Muffin was given to the shelter, and then to another family. So there’s some good news, at least.\n\n\nAs for myself, I was told the effects might never wear off. I didn’t believe them at first. I mean, who would? And how do you even process that kind of news?\n\n\nFuck, I don’t know. All I know is that the black figure is still standing at the end of my hallway, asking me to join it. I can still hear static.

You had a small turtle in your hands. You kept calling it Michaelangelo, which I assumed was a nod to the Ninja Turtles. You tossed your long, brown hair behind your back and knelt down to place the turtle on the ground. You were excited to see it wobbling on the grass. It reminded me of my cat and how I used to play with him when I was your age.\n\nI witnessed your entire childhood from my small *window*. Your first ride on a bicycle. Your first day of school. Your first real friend Brenda. Your first day of middle school and the cute uniform you got to wear. The time you won the science fair and you brought home a trophy shaped like a cell. You were such a happy girl.\n\nI saw you grow older. Your body changing. You grew taller, your body slimmer, your face as beautiful as ever. I witnessed as others started to notice you in a different way. The stares from the jealous girls. The googly eyes from the young boys. As all this happened before my eyes, I noticed myself changing too. I got older. I got weaker. I got disillusioned . Bruised. I lost my will to escape my painful life. All I had was this *window* to your life to keep me going.  I lived my days through yours. Watching you was enough entertainment for me. You couldn’t know the different ways you saved me from bad thoughts, bad days and all the pain I had been suffering from.\n\nI saw the day that handsome young man came to pick you up in a red convertible. Your mother wasn’t happy about it, but she knew she had no choice. You had to start spreading your wings at some point. You left in a gorgeous floral dress that matched the summer’s flowers. You came back late that night. You had a stuffed bear and some leftover cotton candy. I imagined you had gone to the fair. I imagined all the rides you must have gone on. All the fun that must have been for you. I was so happy that you had enjoyed your first date. And then came the magical kiss. He leaned in, blushing, and kissed you. Your cheeks were so red that I instantly knew I had witnessed your first kiss. I closed my eyes, imagining what that must have felt like. For *one* second, I imagined it had been me wearing that dress, smiling so big, with butterflies in my belly and a kiss on my lips. But I was happy for you. \n\nI wanted to thank you for allowing me to live again. For allowing me to dream again. I wanted to thank you, but just couldn’t bring myself to you. I couldn’t go talk to you. I didn’t know how. If only you knew about my *window*.\n\nAnd then, one day, I heard him talking about you. The man I live with. He noticed you. I heard him complaining about how pretty girls like you shouldn’t show off their legs like that. The moment he mentioned your legs, I knew it was over. I knew you would become his next trophy. I had to keep you away from him. This was my chance to thank you. I couldn’t let you turn into me.\n\nI had been lucky. I don’t know why he liked me this much. Most other girls came and went, never to return. And yet, amidst all the years, he always kept me down here. I think it’s because he saw that I still had a light in me. Because I had *you*. All the other girls died long before he killed them. I could tell that they were already dead in their eyes long before he viciously murdered them in front of me, showing off his skill.\n\nBut not me. You kept me going. I had my little *window*. A little crack high up on the wall of this basement I call home. He didn’t like that he couldn’t break me down. He didn’t know about the little crack. So he kept me to see how long I could stay like this. It is a sick game... that I’ve been winning thanks to you.\n\nBut then... he noticed you. And I knew, I knew what fate awaited you if he laid his monstrous hands on you. Whatever strength I have left, I’ve collected it and prepared myself to finally do something about it.\n\nI want to thank you. Because if you’re reading this letter, it means I did it. I gathered my courage, packed it neatly into action, and went through with my plan to escape once and for all. I will make him believe I’ve died. I don’t know if it’ll work. But if it does, he will reach to pick me up. I’ll immediately kick him as hard as I can where it’ll hurt the most. *As hard as I can*. I will then steal his keys and run as fast as I can and drop this letter off in your mailbox. I have a feeling he will chase me and get a hold of me eventually because I am weak... I’m very weak. Battered. There is barely a human left in this body of mine. But if that is the case, I’ve been prepared to leave this world for a long time. I doubt anyone will hear or see me. This street is so desolate. You’re the only life here it seems sometimes. But so long as you get this letter, I know that I did my part and that you’ll be safe. \n\nMonsters are real. This one is named Ryan Morehouse. He is your front door neighbor. I have been kept captive in his basement for a very long time. I’ve lost track of the years but I believe I must be in my late twenties by now. I was fifteen when he first brought me here. My parents must have looked for me. Please don’t tell them about me. I don’t want them to know about the tortures he put me through. I don’t want them to see me broken down this way. I just want you to report him to the police. His evil nature and depraved mind can only be stopped if he is caught behind bars. \n\nThey will find bodies dangling in the walls of the basement. I’ve learned to live with  the smell by now but they will notice it the second they step down here. There are a lot of young girls in the walls of my room down here. Tell them to treat them delicately. They were good girls. They’ve been my companions. My friends. \n\nMost of all, I want to thank you. You’re the only thing that kept me going. You were my light. And now, I’m escaping thanks to you. Escaping this awful room. Escaping this awful life. Even if it means I finally get to die.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe girl who watched you grow up\n\n——————————-\n\nWe found this letter in our mailbox. After contacting the police, they entered the home of our neighbor across the street. Over a span of five days, they found a total of fifteen bodies hidden in different parts of his house. He had plans to kidnap our daughter, but thanks to this mysterious stranger, his plan was intercepted. We still have not found the girl who wrote this. We like to think she made it out alive, but, sadly, it isn’t likely as Ryan Morehouse is also missing. We don’t even know her name. But we did find the little crack in the wall, the one where she saw my daughter grow up from. \n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9djazj\/letter_from_the_girl_who_watched_you_grow_up_part\/?st=JLQORSH8&sh=eb0a14d0)"},"234":{"title":"My missing husband came home, but I just know it isn't him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/tgmnx6\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_just_know_it\/","flair":null,"author":"writing-with-l","selftext":"My husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back. \n\nUntil he did. \n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn’t remember anything about the last six months. \n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it. \n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can’t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don’t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl. \n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do. \n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar. \n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that’s just so out of character for him. \n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can’t believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn’t get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn’t even try to defend her. \n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might’ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this. \n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there. \n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/u9cq7q\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_know_it_isnt\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"},"235":{"title":"Fran and Jock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/61b5ls\/fran_and_jock\/","flair":null,"author":"Pippinacious","selftext":"I was the last in a long line of grandkids on both sides of the family. No one has ever said as much, but I'm pretty sure I was an \"oops\" baby; the result of one too many glasses of wine and a couple over forty who thought unplanned pregnancies were for teens.\n\n\nOops.\n\n\nBy the time I came along, both of my grandmothers had already passed away and my grandfathers were elderly and lived in different states. Trying to coordinate travel plans for a family of five, including an infant, was difficult on a budget and neither of my grandpas were up to frequent trips, so visits were rare and spaced out over long periods.\n\n\nStill, both of my parents wanted me to have a relationship with them, so we'd trade phone calls so they could hear my nonsensical baby babble, they'd write me letters for Mom and Dad to read to me, and they'd get crayon scribbles in return. \n\n\nWhen I was three, they both started to experience declines in health. First my maternal grandpa, then my paternal one. Fearing the worst, Mom purchased a pair of teddy bears, the kind that had recorders in them so you could record a message that would play when the bear was hugged, and made sure to get a message saved from both.\n\n\nMy mom's father died when I was four. A few days after his funeral, I was given a white teddy bear with bright blue eyes that twinkled from beneath a plaid flat cap and a green sweater. When I gave it a squeeze, I heard my grandpa's slightly muffled voice from its stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nTwo years later, after Dad's father passed, I got the other one. It was a slate gray color and the stitching on his face gave him a rather serious expression for a stuffed animal. A pair of red suspenders held up his tan trousers. I fell asleep hugging it and my dad told me some years later, with tears in his eyes, that randomly throughout that night, he kept hearing Grandpop's voice coming from my room.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nI named my white bear Fran and my gray bear Jock and put them on a shelf above my bed, where they sat throughout my childhood. Honestly, I didn't give them much thought; they had become fixtures of my room, the same way the lamp and dresser were. Every now and again, I'd come home from school to find one of my parents standing beside my bed, looking up at the bears or giving them a little squeeze. Even as time passed, they still recited their single phrase without fail.\n\n\nAside from those instances, though, Fran and Jock were little more than dust collectors from my childhood.\n\n\nWhen I went away to college, the two didn't make the cut and were left behind while I made my way out into the world for the first time. I think my parents were a little disappointed that I wasn't more sentimental over the teddies, but any memories I had of my grandpas were hazy at best and I didn't have the same emotional connection that they did. \n\n\nWhen Mom gently asked about whether I would like them when I moved into my first apartment, I told her no, that they were probably better off with her. \n\n\n\"Ok.\" She said. \"Well, they'll be here if you change your mind.\"\n\n\nI was pretty confident I wouldn't.\n\n\nThe next time I went back to my parents' place was to housesit while Dad took Mom on their long awaited vacation out west. He'd been promising her they'd go for over thirty years and they were both buzzing with excitement. In typical Mom fashion, however, she was also very nervous.\n\n\n\"You remember where all the financial documents are in case anything happens to us, right?\" She asked from the backseat at least six times on the drive to the airport.\n\n\n\"Yes, in the white bin under your bed.\"\n\n\n\"And the wills?\"\n\n\n\"Fireproof lock box in the back of your closet.\"\n\n\n\"And th-\"\n\n\n\"I think she's got it, hon.\" Dad said, reaching back to give her knee a squeeze.\n\n\nMom harrumphed and sat back. \"Just call if you need anything.\"\n\n\n\"I'll be fine, don't worry! You're only going for a week.\"\n\n\n\"A lot can happen in a week.\" She said.\n\n\nI grinned at her in the rearview mirror, unconcerned, and she made a face at me, but seemed to relax.\n\n\nAfter I dropped them off, I drove back to their place and started to make myself at home again. I tossed my suitcase on my bed and went to the kitchen to make some dinner and catch up on one of my shows. It had been a while since I'd had a true, completely free week all to myself and I planned to take full advantage of it. After I ate, I kicked up my feet, stretched out, and commenced \"Lazy Lump\" mode.\n\n\nI managed to get almost three episodes in before I started to nod off. I checked the clock over the TV and sighed. It was only just after eleven; was I really turning into an old, early-to-bed woman already? The horror! I rolled off the couch and shut off the tv and all the lights, plunging the house into a deep darkness.\n\n\nEven in the inky black, I didn't feel even a twinge of nervousness. I'd grown up in the house, I knew it like the back of my hand, and all of its creaks and groans were almost comforting. I made my way to my room and flipped on the light. It had been at least five years since I lived there, but my parents hadn't done much to change my room except store a few bits and bobs in the closet. They said it was so I'd know I'd always have a place with them. I thought it was because changing it would make the fact that I was out for good more real. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, I appreciated the familiarity.\n\n\nAs I started to unpack my bag, my eye was drawn to the shelf over my bed. Fran and Jock, ever vigilant, were sitting in the same spots they'd occupied for most of my life. I don't know why, but I couldn't help but smile and reach out to them. \n\n\nI took Fran down first and gave his little cap a tweak before squeezing him around his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said.\n\n\nAfter putting Fran back, I did the same to Jock, who stared up at me with his usual sternness even as I plucked one red suspender. \n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpop said.\n\n\nIt was the first time I'd listened to them in a while. Even if they didn't resonate as deeply with me as they did my parents, I was glad to find their recordings still worked.\n\n\nA quick trip to the bathroom and a change into my pjs later, I was in bed and fast falling asleep.\n\n\nI can't say exactly what woke me. A nightmare, I figured, given that my heart was beating quite quickly, but I couldn't remember any details. I took a deep breath and rolled over, already falling half asleep again, and found myself face to face with a dark figure on the pillow beside me. I yelped and sat up, grabbing at my phone, my nearest source of light, and shined it towards my bed.\n\n\nFran was lying on his side beside me.\n\n\nI let out a small chuckle and gave myself a little shake to dismiss the lingering fright that he'd caused and picked him up.\n\n\n\"Did you fall off the shelf?\" I asked him quietly. I must have put him back too close to the edge earlier and gravity had done its duty. \n\n\nI gave Fran a gentle squeeze.\n\n\n\"Get out.\" \n\n\nI stared down at the bear and blinked once, very slowly. I must be more sleepy than I realized, I thought. I was hearing things. To prove to myself that it had just been my imagination, I squeezed him again.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nIt was still Grandpa's voice, but instead of the soft warmth it had always had, it sounded cold, almost menacing. I threw Fran across the room, where he hit the wall.\n\n\nFrom over my head, I heard Grandpop's more gravely voice.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nI whipped around and looked up at Jock. He was sitting in the same place as always, but now he was turned towards the door instead of facing forwards. Had I put him down like that? I couldn't remember.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpa's voice came from Fran again, louder this time. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpop echoed from Jock.\n\n\nThe two went back and forth, their voices getting louder and louder, until I slapped my hands over my ears and leapt from my bed. I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck behind my fear tangled tongue. I stumbled across my dark room, chased by my long dead grandfathers' voices.\n\n\n\"I know you're down there!\" Jock shouted with Grandpop's voice.\n\n\nI froze. Down there? Down under the shelf? I glanced over my shoulder at the gray bear staring silently down from over my bed. I had to get out of my room. I had to get out of the house! I yanked open my door.\n\n\n\"I see you!\" Fran said in Grandpa's voice.\n\n\nI was halfway out into the hall, tears streaming down my face. I didn't know what was happening, was I going crazy? Was I dreaming? All I knew was that my two childhood toys were screaming threats at me and I had to get away from them. I turned towards the stairs.\n\n\n\"You take one more step, I'll make sure it's your last!\" Jock bellowed. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Fran roared.\n\n\nFrom somewhere downstairs, a step creaked. \n\n\nSomeone else was in the house. \n\n\nThey weren't yelling at me at all, I realized with a very strange mix of confusing relief and newly formed horror. They were yelling at the intruder who was making their way up the stairs, towards me.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" My grandfathers howled together.\n\n\nFootsteps clamored across the wood floor downstairs. Something fell over in the living room with a loud crash, and again in the kitchen, before the back door slammed against the counter as it was thrown open and a car engine rumbled to life. \n\n\nSomehow, I regained my wits enough to run to my parents room and look out the window to the driveway below. An SUV was peeling backwards out into the street. It slammed into the neighbor's mailbox, righted itself, and then screeched off into the night.\n\n\nA heavy quiet had fallen over the house again.\n\n\nAfter waiting a few, long, tense minutes, I crept back across the hall and peeked into my room. Fran and Jock were where I'd left them, both completely silent. When they stayed that way, I hesitantly approached Fran, who was lying on his side with his little flat cap beside him. I picked him up and, with trembling fingers, squeezed his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said warmly.\n\n\nI put his cap back on his head and gently put him back on the shelf beside Jock and backed out of the room, watching them the whole time with wide eyes. As I rounded the corner, heading downstairs to the phone, I heard Grandpop's voice trailing after me.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nThe police arrived a bit later, following my frantic call to 911. I filed a report, leaving out the bit about my talking bears, and allowed them to collect whatever evidence they could. Every so often, I found myself glancing at the stairs, almost like I was expecting a repeat of whatever had just happened. It never came and the cops wrapped it up, leaving me alone again.\n\n\nWhen I called my parents to tell them about the break in, they immediately wanted to rush home, but I assured them there was no need.\n\n\n\"Really,\" I said, \"I don't think I have anything to worry about.\"\n\n\n\"We could be on the next plane.\" Mom insisted.\n\n\n\"No, I'm ok. Whoever that guy was, I'm pretty sure he won't be back.\"\n\n\nIt took a few more go arounds, but I eventually convinced them I was safe.\n\n\nAnd I felt it, too, for the most part. After the initial shock had worn off and I'd had time to process what had happened, I really was ok. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't tell anyone what had happened without sounding crazy, but I knew it had been real and I knew, as long as I had Fran and Jock sitting on the shelf above my bed, I could sleep easy.\n\n\nA few days later, the cops did find the guy who broke in. He was a coworker of my dad's who'd overheard he'd be out of town. He thought the house would be empty and easy pickings. When he tried to tell them about the two crazy guys upstairs and their violent threats, they rolled their eyes and laughed at him. He was very surprised to hear that only a twenty-two year old woman had been in the house during his botched burglary. \n\n\nWhen I returned home to my apartment a week later, Fran and Jock were with me. I keep them on the tv stand in the living room now, where they have a full view of the front door. Whenever I start to feel a bit anxious about being alone, I'll give each bear a little squeeze and smile as they speak.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nAnd now I respond. \"I love you both, too.\""},"236":{"title":"I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. \n\nI slept for a few hours, I don’t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It’s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it’s hard to say.\n\nI checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there’s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. \n\nI hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could’ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.\n\n“How can I help you sir?” she asked. \n\nI froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. “Where are we? Why does it look like we’re flying over an ocean?”\n\nShe wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. “Sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\n“I, uh, OK, thank you,” I said.\n\nAfter she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.\n\nIt hadn’t changed. \n\nI had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn’t changed at all?  \n\nI opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.\n\nThey never did.\n\nI tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. “Yes?” she asked. \n\n“Do you know how long until we land?” I asked.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant said it would be about another hour.”\n\nI shook my head in confusion. “That flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should’ve landed already.”\n\nShe stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. \n\n“Sir, I’m going to ask you to calm down, or I’ll be calling the Captain.”\n\nI told him that wouldn’t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. \n\nThe flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I’ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. \n\nI’ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they’ve all told me that they’re expecting to land in an hour or so. \n\nAround three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. \n\n“Sir, the seatbelt sign is on,” one said. “Please remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nI’d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn’t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. \n\nI shot a look around before unrolling it. \n\nIt said, “Are you stuck too?”\n\nI pulled out a pen and wrote “Yes. It’s been thirty hours.”\n\nI folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. \n\nIt’s been twenty minutes since then. I don’t know why, but I don’t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn’t matter. I have to do *something*. I’ll update you all with whatever happens next.\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dm86h5\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/)\n\nMore:\n\n\/r\/WorchesterStreet"},"237":{"title":"yourfaceyourporn.mov","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/f2w6hp\/yourfaceyourpornmov\/","flair":null,"author":"Max-Voynich","selftext":"***yourfaceyourporn.mov***\n\nMy wife tells me she’s cheating on me about halfway through dinner.\n\nI work my way through the potatoes, the beans, and most of the meat before replying.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“That doesn’t matter.”\n\nIt very much *does* matter, I think. I imagine a 6’4, muscular, chiselled Greek God of a man fucking my wife. I think about the way he holds her – *is he gentle? rough?* – and the noises she makes for him – *is she quiet? does she scream for him?*\n\n“Michael.”\n\nI’m working on the last of the chicken at this point, wondering if she’s ever fucked both of us in the same day-\n\n“*Michael.* Listen to me. I want a divorce.”\n\nI watch her for a while, her jaw, the hollow of her neck:\n\n“Is he better?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Is he better than me?”\n\nShe purses her lips. I think she’s going to tell me that he’s just different, that she’s sorry it had to be like this and that she still loves me, really, deep down, that it was a mistake and no-one could be better than me, but instead she replies.\n\n“Yes, Michael. He’s better than you.”\n\nShe tells me that she’s staying in the house until she finds a place to rent whilst we sort this out. I say that maybe I should have the bed, and she tells me that, *trust me, you don’t.*\n\n“In our bed?”\n\n“Sleep on the couch, Michael.”\n\nAnd so that’s where I find myself, working my way through a bottle of expensive Scotch I’d saved for a special day, and browsing the internet. My browsing is aimless, filthy, meandering – I lurch from website to website going nowhere. That is, until I see an ad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOURFACEYOURPORN**\n\n*Do you want to live out your most disgusting, most depraved fantasies? Do you want to* ***see*** *yourself do it?*\n\n*Using state-of-the-art deepfake technology we’re able to show you what your deepest desires actually look like. See them played out across the screen – the things you’ve only spoken of in whispers, that you’ve never even admitted to yourself.*\n\n*Take control of your life. Be the best version of yourself you can be.*\n\n*This is your face, your porn, your reality.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m in a *fuck it* sort of mood, more than a little drunk, and I think that this might be the best way to get back at her. I don’t even have to leave the comfort of my home, and I can see what I’d look like doing whatever I want. All those things I never told her, the things she’d never do – I can *see* it.\n\nThe ad is blank aside from the text on the white screen, that, and a tacky gif of red lips blowing a kiss, before running their tongue along their teeth.\n\nI watch the mouth on the ad blow kiss after lurid kiss at me, and start to feel convinced.\n\nThey’ll superimpose my face, convincingly into any situation, and I’ll watch myself carry out my darkest, deepest desires.\n\nThere are different packages: celebrity, fetish, slice-of-life, narrative, and on and on -  but one in particular catches my eye:\n\n**“Surprise me.”**\n\nAnd so, squinting so that I can read the numbers on my credit card, I subscribe. I fill out a quick form, what I’m into, my kinks, my age, name, that sort of thing. It then requires me to take a video of my face from different angles, then makes me cycle through a few basic facial expressions, takes a sample of my voice saying a few basic sentences.\n\nNot long after, I pass out.\n\nI awake to a vicious hangover, and a notification on my phone. An email containing the first video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourpurchase.mov*\n\n*it’s really me! or at least, it looks exactly like me. it’s night, and fake-me seems to be followed by a camera. fake-me spends the evening going into various shops around town and buying tape, and an apple from each store. he seems to make the cashiers nervous, and one girl even starts shaking whilst she tries to find the code for the tape when it won’t scan. he is impatient, raps his knuckles on the desk, calls her a bitch under his breath as he leaves.*\n\n*wide-shot: he walks down the street past the glass window – the cashier is crying silently inside.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat’s it. I try to click forward, to see if there’s anything else, but that’s it. I watched the whole thing expecting it to be the build up to *something* but no, instead, all I see is something that looks exactly like me drive around town and buy apples and tape. I try to see if I can find the website again to cancel my subscription, but I can’t find anything. I try and look through my history, but it’s not there – in fact, there’s just an empty gap between 1 and 3am.\n\nWhilst it isn’t porn, the technology behind it is still amazing, the person on the screen looks exactly – *exactly –* like me.\n\nI don’t go to work. I watch TV, drink beer, smoke inside. My wife – and she is still my wife – complains.\n\nI don’t listen.\n\nAround 6pm I receive another email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourgums.mov*\n\n*the camera is focused on the me-that-isn’t-me sat at a table. he’s answering questions. it’s my voice! my voice! he says he is sorry. he says he does not know, no, he never knew. he is fiddling with something in his mouth. above his teeth. he has never heard that name before. he says if they insist but it’s not like he’ll like it. the voice behind the camera laughs.*\n\n*close-up of his mouth: there is a thick, black hair protruding from his gum, just above his teeth, and he is trying to wiggle it loose. it isn’t working. until. until it does, and he pulls out a knot of tangled hairs from his the pink of his gum, and they keep coming and coming and coming until there’s nearly a foot of hair, and with each tug it wobbles his front two teeth a little.*\n\n*he says this has never happened to him before. the voice behind the camera laughs again.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t sleep that well that night. Something about the videos has unsettled me. They’re *too* realistic, and, watching that fake-me fiddle with his gums made my mouth hurt. I say nothing to my wife when she comes in, make no effort to tidy the take-away boxes from the table. She looks at me for a long, long time, as if something is building up inside her, some thought or opinion about me she’s always wanted to tell me, and I watch as it almost bursts out her lips – and then, nothing.\n\nI hear something looking through our bins as I try to sleep. A raccoon? Someone homeless? They disappear when I get up to look.\n\nThe notification wakes me up: another video. I try to reply to the address that’s sending me these, telling them I want them to stop, but the email bounces back. I have no choice but to watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrash.mov*\n\n*the me-that-can’t-possibly-be-me is eating at a new table. but the whole table is covered in trash, dirt, empty cans, pizza boxes, rotting fruit, bones, tiny crawling things etc. etc. there are flies buzzing aimlessly about. he is shovelling as much as he can in his mouth, coffee grounds spill down his chin and he coughs. he keeps looking to the left of the camera after swallowing. he winces, pulls something from his mouth: a razor.*\n\n*he has bitten a razor.*\n\n*his blood is dark and thick, and mixes with the coffee grounds that dribble down his chin so that it looks lumpy and black. it coats his shirt, and his hands as he attempts to wipe his face.*\n\n*he looks to the left of the camera again, and continues eating.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I consider deleting my email account. Something is *wrong* here, there is something in these videos that’s beyond unsettling. I don’t remember pulling half those facial expressions, and his reactions are just like mine. It’s too real.\n\nThat’s *my* wince. That’s the wince of pain I know I do when I stub my toe, or stand on a thumbtack, or bite my tongue.\n\nBut when I get up to fix myself a drink I find my wife’s car gone, and I know that she’s with him, with this guy she’s fucking, and I feel a stab of self-loathing that goes so deep it pierces my stomach and makes me retch.\n\nI watch the video again.\n\nEvening comes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyouranger.mov*\n\n*he is carrying a bunch of grapefruit in his arms in the street. a small, old man bumps into him and the fruit go flying. they make this wet pop as they hit the floor, and in the noise you can hear the fibres that held the fruit together tear. the man is knocked over. the-me-that-looks-too-much-like-me sees someone nearby drinking from a thermos, and, grabbing it, empties the scalding water all over the fallen man’s face.*\n\n*close-up: the-me-that-shouldn’t-be-me spits on him, and winks at the stunned crowd watching. the fallen man moans, and spasms.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t know why, but I sort of *like* this one. The noise of the fruit is so satisfying, so visceral, and there’s something triumphant about the way fake-me snatches the boiling water and pours it over the man. Fake-me is in control.\n\nThat evening my wife tells me that she doesn’t think she ever loved me, not like the way she loves her new man, and that come to think of it I’m not much of a man at all. She says this whilst I try and wipe ketchup from my shirt, but only succeed in getting some on the couch.\n\nWhen she goes to bed upstairs I watch *yourfaceyouranger.mov* over and over again.\n\nI doze.\n\nWith my eyes half-open, the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me winks at the camera.\n\nMy heart gets faster. I pretend to be asleep, and keep my eyes open just a sliver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*fake-me walks away from the crowd, right up to the camera. knocks on my screen a few times with his knuckles. it sounds like glass. he watches through the screen, smiling. his eyes are on me, I’m sure of it. he pushes his face against the camera, against my screen, and stares right at me.*\n\n*there is something behind those eyes, behind that face.*\n\n*something dark, and waiting.*\n\n*he keeps watching me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think he knows I’m awake.\n\nWe stay like that until morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourneighbour.mov*\n\n*he knocks on mrs. tay’s door. he is holding an apple, and tape. she invites him in. he enters, the camera follows. in one movement he stuffs the apple in mrs. tay’s mouth and forces her to the ground where he binds her arms and legs with tape. someone from off camera hands him a hammer.*\n\n*wide-shot: mrs. tay struggles on the floor. the-me-that-watched-me looks through her records, puts one on. it’s old and slow and the vinyl crackles as he drags her into the basement. the video continues for half an hour more, until the vinyl has finished and there is just a loop of a faint crackle, and then there are two thuds, a snap, and it ends.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see someone’s car I don’t recognise in my driveway. It looks expensive.\n\nI go to investigate, but can’t find anyone near it, and so I decide to go and check on Mrs. Tay. I stumble down the street in my dressing gown, face covered in patches of stubble, and knock on her door. No-one answers.\n\nBill Roberts walks past, and I wave at him.\n\n“Seen Mrs. Tay today Bill?”\n\nHe shakes his head. I can tell he’s trying not to react to how I look, trying to be polite.\n\n“Haven’t seen her in a week or so Michael.”\n\nA pause. He’s finding the right words – I can tell.\n\n“You doing okay? You don’t look so good.”\n\n“Never better.”\n\nThe combination of emotions I’m feeling is hard to put into words. I am elated; there is a version of me, online, who is in control, and is acting.\n\nI am, also, terrified. Whatever it is on that screen knows about me, knows something about my life. I don’t know if it is here, in this reality, or if it is just peering in. Either option makes my chest tight.\n\nI’ve drunk the house dry, and have to make several trips to stock up on liquor. I even call a few old contacts and manage to get some pills, although I promise myself I’ll only take them when things get really, really bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrial.mov*\n\n*the shortest video so far. the-me-i-wish-was-me pushes against his jaw, probing. slowly, surely, he slides his hand under the skin of my face, until I can see the outline of my fingers under the skin, like five giant malformed veins. he wriggles the fingers and the skin comes away from my face, my ring finger emerges from my eyelids. he pulls the hand out and it is covered in some sort of embryonic fluid.*\n\n*he winks at the camera.*\n\n*(at me?)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try the same thing that evening after I’ve shaved, pushing my fingers into my face as if the skin is going to slip and I’ll be able to do what he did, but nothing happens. My long nails cut the tender, freshly-shaven skin, and I end up just moving my face the conventional way; I smile, then frown, then stick out my tongue, then puff out my cheeks.\n\nOnce I’m convinced my face still works, I go to bed.\n\nI think my wife sneaks him in the back door: her lover, her casanova.\n\nI can hear them fuck, I think. I can’t wait for morning, can’t wait for a new .mov. I watch *yourfaceyourtrial.mov* on repeat to help me sleep, and when *he* is convinced I’m asleep he comes right up to the camera again, but this time he fiddles with the edges, as if testing the boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*his breathing gets deeper, lustier, he cannot find a way out, so he just watches, cycling through expressions the way I did, convinced that I am asleep.*\n\n*(am I?)*\n\nWhen I wake up, there is a note from my wife telling me that she’s moving in with him for a while.\n\nThere is a voicemail from work telling me I’m fired, and that there’ll be no severance pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourjunkies.mov*\n\n*he (I?) finds a couple of junkies on the outside of town. he shows them a huge stack of cash and they both nod. they have about 6 teeth between them and walk with a pronounced stoop, taking him to an abandoned building on the edge of town.*\n\n*he says go in ahead of me I’ll be right in. they pause for a while, trying to work out what the catch is, why this seemingly average guy would offer all this cash up front, but he hands them both small foil packages and they quickly dash inside.*\n\n*as before, he slowly slips his hand under the skin of his face, working it up and up and up, until both hands are completely under the skin –*\n\n*the camera pans down, to the rusty gate that borders the property.*\n\n*he hangs something from the gate, before walking down the overgrown path into the house.*\n\n*it takes me a while to realise that the thing hanging from the gate is a face.*\n\n*my face.*\n\n*like a mask, the mouth and eyes are empty, and the skin flaps like a heavy flag in the breeze.*\n\n*there is the sound of cars driving past every few minutes – then, two noises like grapefruit bursting, fibrous and wet and sudden*\n\n*he walks back down the path, and puts the face back on.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not manage to see what lies under that face, but I desperately want to.\n\nI think my hair is falling out.\n\nI take a long walk around the block. When I return I find my wife staring at my laptop as if she’s seen the devil. She turns to me, slowly.\n\n“What the *fuck* is this, Michael?”\n\nThe laptop is positioned behind her back, so I can see the screen and her at once. I remember the contents of *yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* and start to panic, if that fell into the wrong hands, with no context-\n\n“I can explain – the videos, they’re not me, all of the places, the situations, they’re fake, I think-“\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n“What situations? Jesus. Michael - it’s just hours and hours and hours of footage of you whispering to the camera. It’s just your face. What’s fake about that?”\n\nI can tell she’s a little scared, her disgust at me slowly morphing into something uglier, nastier. She takes a couple of steps back, as if seeing me for the first time. Behind her I can see the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me smiling at the camera on screen.\n\nThe footage is paused, but he’s still moving, closer and closer to the camera, his eyes wide and with a rigor-mortis smile – a smile as if he’s just learned how to control the musculature of his face perfectly – and he’s holding a finger to his lips.\n\n*Shh.*\n\nShe takes another step back. I try and warn her but no words come. Instead I’m frozen in fear, seeing the fake-me grow closer and closer to the camera, to the screen as her backs turned and-\n\nHe’s pushing against the glass of the screen, trying to find a weak point, a crack that will allow him to move from his reality into ours-\n\nShe can’t take it anymore, she turns around and without looking at the screen she picks my laptop up and smashes it on the floor.\n\n“You’re sick.”\n\nShe leaves.\n\nThe thought of the screen smashed for some reason terrifies me. It’s as if whatever barrier was between me and that *thing* is broken, and although I can’t see anything I feel him leaking into our world, like the soft hiss of gas through a broken pipe, or air escaping a valve.\n\nI take the laptop to be fixed – pay extra to make it happen as fast as possible.\n\nAs soon as the screen is fixed I take it home, desperate to turn it on, to see if there are any new videos – to check on the old ones.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyourpurchase.mov* – the first video I was sent.\n\nA familiar scene plays, except there’s no fake-me. It’s the exact same footage, I’m sure of it, but the me-that-isn’t-me isn’t there at all. The cashier still weeps silently, but it’s not due to any version of me scaring her.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyouranger.mov.*\n\nThe same. The exact same video but the fake-me isn’t there. The man still falls over, coffee is still poured on his face, the crowd still reacts – but there’s no *me.*\n\n*Yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* is now just footage of two junkies walking to a crackhouse, and entering it. They still don’t leave, but there is no face on the gate. Nothing. No sign that I was ever there.\n\nThe house suddenly feels so empty.\n\nI can hear the faint *tap-tap-tap* of the branches against the upstairs window. The gurgling of the drain. The way the old wood creaks ever so slightly with age.\n\nI am alone.\n\nAnd I know then that the reason he’s not on the screen because he’s here.\n\nWith me.\n\nAs I feel sweat start to run down my back, I receive one final email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourturn.mov*\n\n*wide-shot: me, but the* ***real*** *me this time. alone. the room is full of trash, rotting food, empty beer bottles, liquor bottles smashed on the floor, pill bottles, crumpled clothes. the* ***real*** *me holds up a hand, waves it.*\n\n*this is live. this is real time. this is happening. now.*\n\n*the room is dark. objects are obscured. in shadow.*\n\n*something moves behind the window.*\n\n*a curtain rustles.*\n\n*bottles clink.*\n\n*he is in here, somewhere.*\n\n*watching.*\n\n*waiting.*\n\n*I am alone with myself,*\n\n*& I have all the time in the world.*\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/max_voynich)"},"238":{"title":"My wife forgot to delete her browser history.

Hurriedly, I finished zipping up my fly and stared at it in bewilderment.\n\nAmy and I had been almost too careful. We had never so much as looked at one another in my wife’s presence, let alone done anything that could have raised suspicion. There was no way she could have known what was going on, even if she had looked through my phone. With a heavy heart, I’d forced myself to delete any incriminating photos Amy sent me after I was done with them, and we had a strict call-only policy.\n\nAmy was our latest hire and aside from being great at her job, she excelled in garnering male attention. Everyone loved her. She was strikingly beautiful and uninhibited to the point where her energy felt almost carnal, sending all morals and restraints out the window. I tried to ignore her at first, even finding excuses to go home early, but eventually, her charming giggle got the better of me too.\n\n**4:37 PM: How much does divorce cost?**\n\nDroplets of sweat sprang out on my forehead. *What?* Was my wife planning to divorce me? But *why?* There was no way she knew about Amy and me. Was there someone else? Was she planning to accuse me of infidelity, all while going at it with some lover boy she’d met at her yoga class?\n\n**4:39 PM: Why do humans feel emotions?**\n\nI pursed my lips. If by some miracle my wife did know about the affair, I couldn’t imagine the way she must have been feeling. I woke up late this morning and found a note on the kitchen table, saying that she didn’t want to wake me and that she was out doing her Saturday errands. I almost felt compelled to call her and – oh…\n\nI flinched as a large drop of blood landed on the keyboard. *What the hell?* My first instinct was to look up at the ceiling. Nothing. A strong metallic smell made me come to my senses. I brushed my hand against my face. A bright red smudge sat on my palm. I stared at it, alarmed. I’d never gotten nosebleeds before, aside from the time I got hit in the face with a football in high school. My head raised, I scrambled to my feet and made a dash for the bathroom, my hands cupping my throbbing nose.\n\nOnce I had managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned myself up, I returned to the computer.\n\n**4:44 PM: Which part of the brain is responsible for love?**\n\nThis was… an oddly specific search. I couldn’t recall my wife ever being interested in science or biology. I checked the account logged into the browser, just in case. Perhaps this was someone else’s history altogether? Or maybe we’d been hacked?\n\nNo. Seemed like everything was in order. My wife’s smiling face stared back at me from the login window. What was she doing searching for brain parts anyway?\n\n**4:49 PM: What is excerebration?**\n\nWhat? What was…*excerebration?* Some kind of fancy divorce? I’d never heard of the term in my life. I didn’t even hesitate before clicking it, eager to find out what my wife was planning for us.\n\nI wish I hadn’t.\n\nAs the results came up on the monitor, my stomach lurched and my gag reflex kicked in. The images were graphic enough for my hand to automatically gravitate towards the ‘return’ button, but a short paragraph in bold caught my eye.\n\n***‘An ancient procedure involving chiseling through the bone of the nose, in order to scoop out the brain matter.’***\n\nMy heart hammering in my chest, I clicked the ‘back’ button and scanned the rest of the entries.\n\n**5:01 PM: Can a person live without the hypothalamus?**\n\n**5:05 PM: Location of the hypothalamus**\n\n**5:11 PM: How much Temazepam is safe?**\n\nMy skin crawled as I read, but I couldn’t look away. I was so immersed that I didn’t even hear the front door bang.\n\n“Honey? I’m home!”\n\nI stared at the wall, too shocked to reply. What was I meant to say? How was I supposed to ask her about all this?\n\n“Hello?” she called again, her heels clacking towards me.\n\n“Uh, hey!” I choked, throwing the box of tissues into the drawer, “How was…”\n\n“Oh, good,” she smiled as she appeared in the doorway, “How are you? You had quite a lot to drink last night!”\n\n“I-uh…” I stammered, “I did?”\n\nShe studied me, as though she wasn’t sure whether I was joking or not.\n\n“The… I… W-what’s all this?” I asked, gesturing to the computer screen.\n\nShe joined me at the desk, frowning at the clammy wood surface, “What?”\n\nI pointed at the browsing history, my index finger shaking visibly in the air.\n\n“Oh,” she flushed, two pink spots appearing on her cheeks, “Well, you did say we could try it, so… I had to do a little research, y’know?”\n\n“What? I said we could try…what?”\n\n“Oh,” she waved her hand dismissively, “The exce-something. You probably know better.”\n\nMy blood ran cold. *The excerebration.*\n\n“Karen…what did you do?”\n\nBut before she could say anything, a splash of blood landed on the carpet. And then another one. And another. Karen watched me, her skin growing pale, “W-what…”\n\nSuddenly, a small fleshy lump escaped my nostril and rolled down the front of my shirt. We both stared at it in shocked silence. Then, my wife screamed, turning on her heel to flee the room, but I caught up to her, pinning her against the wall.\n\n“Tell me what the fuck you did!”\n\nShe tried to fight me, writhing under my grip, but I held on tight. Blood was streaming into my mouth and down my chin, staining both of our clothes.\n\n“H-how can you not remember?” she screeched, trying to elbow me in the ribs, “Don’t you remember what you did?”\n\nI stared at her panic-stricken face, trying my best to recall any memories from the previous night, “No…what did I do?”\n\n“You…you came home after work and told me you were leaving me for Amy,” she sobbed, “You said you didn’t want to love her, but you did!”\n\nI stood there quietly, mulling it over, as more pulp splashed onto my stomach.\n\n“Ew! We need to call you an ambulance!” Karen shrieked, trying to pull away, “What the fuck is that?”\n\n“Then what happened?” I demanded, my heart practically leaping out of my chest, “Tell me what you did.”\n\n“What the fuck, John?” she screamed, “We got drunk, okay? We got really wasted! And then you said you knew of a way to fix this! To fix us! You said there’s something called hypothalamus in your brain, and if removed it would stop you from loving Amy…”\n\nI felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. What the hell was she saying? Had she actually attempted to remove a part of my brain? And…\n\n“Wait…” I whispered, “Who’s Amy?”\n\nHer expression made me feel foolish for not remembering. I knew that name. *Amy.* It sounded so familiar, and yet I couldn’t for the life of me put my finger on it.\n\n“What…what the fuck do you mean?” she sounded bewildered, “Amy! The girl you were cheating on me with for six months?”\n\n“I… I don’t,” I mouthed, releasing my wife and crumpling to the floor, “I don’t remember.”\n\nKaren stared at me, her white blouse resembling a massacre, her mouth pressed into a thin line.\n\n“What…what’s happening to me?” I whispered.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, but I could see her eyes brimming with tears, “Honey….What if… What if I… accidentally hit your hippocampus instead?”\n\n*What?* That told me nothing.\n\n“For fuck’s sake, Karen, I’m not a *fucking* encyclopedia! Enlighten me! What the hell is a hippocampus?”\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what she said next.\n\n“Honey,” she sobbed, “You’re…a doctor. It’s the memory part of your brain.”"},"239":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game?

I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, and has never been, a fantasist.\n\nOk so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman. Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps \"studied\" isn't the word. It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject. Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot. \n\nWe met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it. She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I’m not too sure what she saw in me.\n\nWe were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio. The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand. We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.\n\nThat party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst… something like that.\n\nThe radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you’ll glean further down, I’m less happy about it than I would’ve thought.\n\nArriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox. An email that would later be described as \"suspicious\" by my tech literate friends. Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni, and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. Lessons like \"Don't call it Cyberspace\" of course and more importantly, \"Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address.\"\n\nI realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:\n\nLeft.Right.AS\n\nI don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.\n\nOpening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file \"07-02-2017\". (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).\n\nI’ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me. They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I’d have to agree. But the thing is, I do know her. Alice Sharma only cares about the truth and if that's the case with these files, insane as it may sound, then it’s very possible my friend has documented her own disappearance.\n\nThe people who suggested this forum said you discuss strange occurrences etc. If you guys have come across anything to do with the below, or know any of the people involved, then please send any information my way. \n\nHas anyone here heard of the Left\/Right Game?\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/redd.it\/7bkk41)\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/redd.it\/7cf4h8)\n\n[Part 4](https:\/\/redd.it\/7dmuvp)\n\n[Part 5](https:\/\/redd.it\/7fdu9c)\n\n[Part 6](https:\/\/redd.it\/7h9jzb)\n\n[Part 7](https:\/\/redd.it\/7jabqd)\n\n[Part 8](https:\/\/redd.it\/7loh1l)\n\n[Part 9](https:\/\/redd.it\/7q3x6e)\n\n[Part 10](https:\/\/redd.it\/7uyiss)\n\n***\nThe Left\/Right Game\n[DRAFT 1]\n07\/02\/2017\n\nThey say great stories happen to those who can tell them. Robert J. Guthard is an exception to that rule. As I sit at his table, sip his coffee and listen to him recount the past 65 years it sounds like he's reading off a shopping list. Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences. Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits. \n\nIt's a great story, no matter how you tell it.\n\nBy the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer, and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.\n\n**ROB:** Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.\n\n**AS:** For work?\n\n**ROB:**Vietnam.\n\n**AS:** You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?\n\n**ROB:** I ain't never been back since.\n\nThat was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.\n\nRob had four marriages after that, and even more professions. After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.\n\n**ROB:** I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?\n\n**AS:** My mum and dad are from India yeah.\n\n**ROB:** See I could tell.\n\nHe'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk. \n\nA friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.\n\n**ROB:** The Japanese are good people. Good manners. But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for, spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?\n\n**AS:** I don't think so\"\n\n**ROB:** Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu. Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.\n\n**AS:** Did you ever meet Jorogumo?\n\n**ROB** Nah she didn't show. None of them did. I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara\n\nAokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji, a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, took him to Aokigahara to chase \"yurei\" the ghosts of the forest.\n\n**AS:** Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?\n\n**ROB:** Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.\n\nFrom that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.\n\n**ROB:** It walked up to me through the trees. Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.\n\n**AS:** Almost?\n\n**ROB:** It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.\n\nHiroji had good reason to be annoyed. Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? I'd be more than a little cranky.\n\nBut Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends. Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.\n\n**ROB:** I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.\n\n**AS:** How many have you proven so far?\n\n**ROB:** Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. That's why I called you guys up.\n\nAt this point, Rob can’t hope to repress his smile.\n\nThe Left\/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, only Rob took an interest in the post.\n\n**ROB:** The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.\n\n**AS:** What details grabbed your interest?\n\n**ROB:** Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.\n\n**AS:** And you were that somebody.\n\n**ROB:** That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.\n\n**AS:** And how did it go?\n\n**ROB:** Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left\/Right Game is the real thing.\n\nThe rules of the Left\/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, but Rob says their not so easy to follow.\n\n**ROB:** There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.\n\n**AS:** Did you move to Phoenix for the Left\/Right game?\n\n**ROB:** That's right.\n\nI try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. I can clearly read his expression too. \"You'll see.\" It says. \"Just wait.\"\n\nI wouldn't have to wait long. Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. He didn't just want to talk about the Left\/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.\n\nRob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, \"Prepping the Run\", as he calls it. He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.\n\nMore after this.\n\nWhen I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.\n\n**ROB:** - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road.\"\n\nRob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he’s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.\n\n**ROB:** We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.\n\n**AS:** There are other people coming?\n\n**ROB:** We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.\n\nThis is the first I’ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I’m surprised. The game is Rob's obsession, and I’m here at his request. The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.\n\nHalf an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the \"functional clothing\" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I take my pack out to the porch. Rob’s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.\n\n**AS:** I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.\n\n**ROB:** If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.\n\n**AS:** Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.\n\n**ROB:** Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.\n\n**AS:** Thank you.\n\n**ROB:** In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, she's a thing of beauty.\n\nTo Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. It’s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.\n\n**ROB:** What're you thinking?\n\n**AS:** I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.\n\n**ROB:** Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.\n\n**AS:** Aren't Jeeps open top usually?\n\n**ROB:** Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.\n\nI climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.\n\nI wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.\n\n**ROB:** We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.\n\n**AS:** His name's Apollo?\n\n**ROB:** That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.\n\n**AS:** Why are you using call signs?\n\n**ROB:** Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, keep communication clear.\n\n**AS:** What's your callsign?\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman.\n\n**AS:** ... What's my call sign?\n\n**ROB:** I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?\n\n**AS:** I'm from Bristol.\n\n**ROB:** Bristol? That’s fine I guess.\n\nIt’s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner. Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.\n\nApollo vaguely resembles his namesake, dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it’s clear he couldn’t be less of a fighter. This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.\n\n**AS:** How far have you come?\n\n**APOLLO:** I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.\n\n**AS:** And you know Rob from the forums?\n\n**APOLLO:** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nRob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. Rob’s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. I was more impressed with Rob himself. Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. My dad is Rob’s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.\n\nThe rest don't take long to arrive. Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. They’re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. Pleasure to meet you ma'am.\n\n**AS:** Pleasure to meet you too.\n\n**CLYDE:** Would you be the journalist?\n\n**AS:** That's right.\n\n**CLYDE:** You used to write for the town paper didn't you?\n\nHe's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.\n\nNext to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.\n\n**LILITH:** We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-\n\n**EVE:** -He's a seismologist\n\n**LILITH:** Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. Predictable movement.\n\n**EVE:** We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.\n\n**AS:** I'll have to check my schedule\n\n**EVE:** OK cool let me give you my email...\n\nThey quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.\n\nThe last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign “Ace”. Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.\n\n**ROB:** Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-\n\n**ACE:** It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.\n\n**ROB:** You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.\n\n**ACE:** I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.\n\n**ROB:** Well I know that's true.\n\nAce and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.\n\nWith five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. Communicate clearly and often. It’s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn’t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers? Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he’s put into these runs, the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.\n\nWith a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.\n\n**ROB:** You ready for this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I'm ready.\n\n**ROB:** Ok then let's hit the road.\n\nThe Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.\n\nRob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. He looks back to the road as Ace’s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.\n\n**APOLLO:** This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha\n\n**ROB:** Hah as many as it takes.\n\nI can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. Before you find out this is all just a story.\n\n**AS:** Does that disappoint you?\n\n**ROB:** I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.\n\n**AS:** OK...\n\n**ROB:** We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, walk in any direction you like, and you won’t be in the game no more. Once we go through, you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you’re home. And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?\n\n**AS:** I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.\n\n**ROB:** Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.\n\nWe've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. I even start to worry if there’ll be anything at all for this story. “Reporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man” isn’t exactly Pulitzer worthy.\n\nTurn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..\n\nI briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. Even from a distance I can see that she’s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.\n\nI look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. She’s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.\n\n**AS:** Rob what's happening?\n\n**ROB:** Ignore her.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.\n\n**AS:** Miss, are you alright?\n\nThe smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!\n\nI reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, with every intent of breaking through.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Would you dance down the lion’s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!\n\nRob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. She yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by. \n\nAs she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.\n\nThe mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, the fractured spider’s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.\n\n**AS:** Rob, what was that?\n\n**ROB:** She's there sometimes.\n\n**AS:** On that street?\n\n**ROB:** On the 34th turn.\n\n**AS:** Who is she?\n\n**ROB:** I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.\n\nI find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.\n\nIf we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. Maybe he'd bought into the game’s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.\n\nAlternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.\n\nThere is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**LILITH:** Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?\n\n**AS:** I think it picked her up.\n\n**LILITH:** My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?\n\n**AS:** When's our stopping point?\n\n**ROB:** For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.\n\nRob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.\n\nWe'd arrived at the tunnel.\n\n**AS:** What is this supposed to pass under?\n\n**ROB:** Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.\n\n**AS:** And if we weren't playing the game?\n\n**ROB:** Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?\n\nRob turns to me. It’s the first time he’s taken his eyes off the road since we started. He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.\n\n**ROB:** You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?\n\nIt’s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn’t feel like he’s attempting to dramatise. It feels like I’m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what’s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?\n\n**AS:** What are you waiting for?\n\nRob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.\n\n**ROB:** This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. We got a long ways to go.\n\nMuch like the game I’m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. I’d heard all about his life, but I’m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I’m not certain that I trust him. And though I admire his dedication to the Left\/Right Game, I’m not sure I’ll like where it might lead us. Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, I’m along for the ride."},"240":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I’m so stressed and I’ve barely slept since I discovered that Jamie was missing. It’s starting to make me feel a little twitchy. But I thought I’d better update you guys. \n\nI was overwhelmed by all the suggestions you gave me and have taken more than a few of them on board. I’m definitely going to be getting a huge planter full of sage for the balcony and I did spill a little salt in my doorway. I’m sorry to disappoint but that didn’t help at all. \n\nThere’s nothing I’m following quite like Mrs Hemming’s rules. I’ve followed them to the letter so far, and lo and behold I’m still alive. That’s not to say it hasn’t been tough. Il start from the beginning. \n\n\n\n\nI was going crazy. And a few hours after my last post Jamie still hadn’t returned. He had been gone for almost 24 hours. His work have called me multiple times. I don’t know what to say so I just keep ghosting the calls. \n\nI was bang in the middle of the danger time when I decided checking the lift had to be my first step. But I wasn’t going to break that rule. \n\nI waited. I waited desperately for 3.34 to come and I’m ashamed to say that when it did I remained paralysed to our sofa for almost half an hour before I found the nerve to leave the flat. It was 4.02 when I finally reached the lift. \n\nThe lift in this building is old and rickety. It hasn’t been updated in a very long time and has likely been here as long as the building. It’s big, clunky buttons stared back at me as I glared at them, hoping for some sort of answer or clue. My heart thumped and I was overcome with a feeling of dread but nothing came of any of it. It was hopeless. \n\nI stepped inside the lift, rode it up and down a few floors and searched the entire perimeter with a phone torch for anything I could find. I found nothing. Jamie had completely disappeared. \n\nSobbing and exhausted I rode back to floor 7 and turned my key in flat 42, the perfect home that felt anything but home at that point. \n\nI sat at the cheap flat pack dining table we’d managed to put together on move-in day and cried. My hands shaking as I held my phone. \n\nI was flitting between reading all your comments and contemplating calling the police for an hour. But I decided to call my friend Georgia instead. I needed a real person here, things were so crazy I wasn’t sure the police would be able to help with what little information I had. But I knew I needed to sound it out with someone.\n\nIl spare you the details again, but I told her everything. She promised she’d be with me in the late morning, she had to take her younger brother to school. \n\nI waited anxiously. Not before arming every room exactly as advised. Before I knew it I looked at the clock and it was 8.23, I had around half an hour until the postman was due to show up. \n\nThere was no way I was missing him today. I stood by the door looking vacantly at the wood, like someone in a film who was possessed. The exhaustion was really setting in but Jamie was all I could think of. Pure adrenaline was keeping me standing. \n\nAt 8.52 I opened the door. The next two minutes were the longest of my life but when I saw him a wave of relief swept my entire body. \n\nRight on cue, 8.54 the postman, Ian Flanders stood in front of me, a smile that barely hid his concern covering his younger than expected face. He didn’t look old enough to have been the postman for over 35 years but I was too  distracted by the answers that I needed from him to care.\n\n“You must be the new tenant.” He stated, but in a way that it sounded like a question. I struggled with my answer, so I got straight to the point.\n\n“Mrs Hemmings left me a note, she said to speak to you if - “\n\n“Can I come in dear? I think we need to chat.”\n\nI ushered Ian in, my hands still shaking as I flapped them in the direction of the sofa, gesturing for him to sit down. I shoved the now slightly crumpled note into his lap and waited. \n\n“I’m glad Prue still thinks that highly of me. I will miss that old girl.” He said with a coy smile as he reached the end of the note. \n\n“Can you help me or not?” I had no time for his ego trip over a moved on neighbour. \n\n“I can help. But I can’t stop for long so it’ll have to be quick. I’ve walked these halls delivering the post for 40 years. I’ve seen it all, everything Prue’s mentioned and more. What do you need to know?” He said.\n\nIan was nothing like what I expected. The note made me feel like he was going to be a kindly, old grandad type figure, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Postman Ian spoke with a thick city accent, and wore a heavy gold chain around his tattooed neck. He had dyed his greying hair boot polish black.\n\nHis demeanour was thankfully non threatening but extraordinarily cocky. He was the sort of man I imagined in a betting shop, rubbing his grubby hands on notes as he bragged over a win. \n\nHe didn’t ask as he lit a cigarette in my living room. I didn’t question it, we would usually smoke outside but I wasn’t going to argue over technicalities. I grabbed a bowl for the ash and lit one too. \n\n“Let’s start with the things in the lift. My boyfriend is missing and he took the lift at quarter past 3 over 24 hours ago. We hadn’t got this note yet. I haven’t heard from him since. I need to get him back.” I barked at him as if the louder I spoke the more I could influence his answer. But nothing prepared me for what he said. \n\nHis skin turned pale and his harsh looking face became more sympathetic as he explained. \n\n“He’s dead, love. Forget about him now. Only one person has ever come back from the lift at that time of night and it was Prue herself. After witnessing it. Those creatures ripping their victim apart. Poor Prue was traumatised. Your boy is gone, let go and follow the rules.” He was blunt but I could tell he felt sorry for me. \n\n“There must be something I can do!” I pleaded.\n\n“There are things I’ve heard to bring back those who are lost but I’ve never seen solid proof they work. It would be irresponsible of me to tell you to do something that might get you killed too. It’s nice here, honest, just get over him and live the status quo. Sorry if I sound harsh, I don’t mean to, but you seem like a decent young lady and I don’t want to see you go too soon.”\n\nI asked about what Mrs Hemmings had seen in the lift and if they were sure it happened to all who entered it. I refused to believe that Jamie was dead. There had to be something I could do and if I knew what I was dealing with I could be better prepared. \n\n“It was awful what happened. I wasn’t there, but this is what I was told. \n\nLittle Lyla was such a cute kid. She used to open the door and give me a tip when I delivered the post. She was Prue’s granddaughter. Lyla was her sons little girl and that night She was staying over for the first time. Prue finally felt confident that she could protect Lyla from all the strange things that happen here...\n\nShe was wrong. Little Lyla had a problem with sleepwalking. And she took a trip into the hallway at half 1 in the morning, Prue took a little too long to notice the sound she had heard was the front door and by the time she reached the lift she saw the creatures dragging Lyla’s limbs away from her body. She tried to fight them, even killed one, but she couldn’t save the little girl.” \n\nI was hysterical, imagining Jamie’s fate.\n\n“What are the creatures? Have you ever actually seen them.” I asked.\n\n“No one really knows what they are love. They’re something to do with the building and all its quirks, no ones ever seen them elsewhere. We don’t know where they came from, just that they’re here. \n\nI’ve seen them a few times over the years, usually when new neighbours have left biscuits down for their cats and dogs or haven’t disposed of food waste properly. \n\nThey’re curious little creatures. Mostly harmless out of the hours Prue warned you about, but if they’re fed they can become quite viscous looking for more food. \n\nThat’s why you have to bin all your scraps, or hide them or pack them or whatever. Just don’t leave them out and don’t use the lift at those times and you’re safe from the creatures. \n\nThey’re a little smaller than humans, but they’re a similar shape, they come with grotesque rodent like features, and are far larger than any rodent could be. Like rodent children I suppose. They have two sharp rows of teeth per jaw and are consistently hungry. \n\nWhen they eat they crunch down in a violent and disgusting way, dripping spittle everywhere, Prue said she could hear her granddaughters bones shatter in those jaws.” He went pale at the thought of that, but continued.\n\n“When they first arrived in the building there were hundreds, it caused pandemonium amongst the residents. We lost the residents of more than 30 of the individual homes. But the residents fought back and managed to kill all but the strongest minority of them. \n\nThe creatures left over were incredibly dangerous and seemingly impossible to eradicate, so the residents struck a deal. A deal that they will be left unharmed and allowed to live in the building in return for the residents safety at all times, but if anyone wanders into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33am they are fair game. \n\nThis timeframe is the period the creatures are at their most frenzied and restricting them to the lift was safer for all parties. God help anyone who encounters them during those hours.\n\nThey’ve been here ever since, claimed lots of unsuspecting people avoiding the stairs, but nothing like when they first arrived. A few got put down for not holding up their end of the bargain but we haven’t had an incident outside the lift in years. Count yourself lucky you missed that crisis. \n\nEverything here’s pretty peaceful right now. I’m sorry about your boyfriend. I really have to go, I’m late for my round.” He scrawled his phone number on a bit of paper and handed it to me. “Emergencies only, I don’t like to be bothered.”\n\n“You can’t go! The note said you would help me!” I exclaimed.\n\n“And I will!” He snapped back, “when there’s something I can help with. I can’t resurrect your boyfriend and I don’t like to be late delivering the post. I will see you soon love.”\n\nI was in shock, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I couldn’t believe he was leaving me after the information overload and the small ray of hope he had lit inside me and then squashed. \n\n“I’ll call the police!” I shouted, desperate to feel as if I was solving this somehow.\n\n“You can try if you want.” Ian sighed, as he opened the door to leave. “It just aggravates the creatures, and it isn’t going to bring your boy back. Mr prentice hates it when police come too, if you want to get any sleep in the next week then I’d avoid it. Wait a week, report him missing and learn to adapt to life here love, or you’ll be dead in days.”\n\nAnd with that he shut the door behind him. I opened it again, I had so much more to ask, but he was gone, no sign of him anywhere in the corridor. \n\nMaybe it was me losing my mind, I might be imagining all these things. But no matter how much I willed it the note was still there. And Jamie still wasn’t.\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia arrived not long after Ian had left. I, of course, asked if she had seen him in the corridor, to try and affirm to myself that he was real, but she hadn’t. She looked at me worried, and held me as I sobbed and told her what the postman had said about Jamie and the creatures. \n\nI wasn’t sure she believed me. Even as she read the note she looked skeptical. If she was skeptical I wouldn’t have blamed her, but she had always been supportive. She sat with me for hours while I just sobbed, heartbroken. I was so conflicted as to what do to. It felt insane that I hadn’t contacted anybody, but this note had turned out to be accurate so far and if the postman was to be trusted then I should wait. \n\nGeorgia had been my best friend for many years, she stuck up for me when I was too scared to do it for myself and had always been the brave one of the two of us. I felt safe around her, so after hours of crying and despairing at the way my life had changed in a matter of days I finally decided to take a nap. It was early evening and Georgia was watching some tv. Just there for me if I needed her.\n\nDespite the deprivation, I struggled to fall asleep, I tried to imagine Jamie’s arms around me but it became a more painful reminder that they probably never will be again. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of staring at the damp patch on ceiling I drifted off. \n\nAbout three hours ago, I woke up, staring at the goddamn damp patch on the ceiling and could hear chatting in the living room. I jumped out of bed and walked towards it.\n\nGeorgia was on the sofa, with a middle aged looking woman, both nursing a cup of tea in the matching mugs that Jamie had got me as a move in present. My blood boiled but it wasn’t their fault, I cleared my throat to get their attention. \n\n“Oh Katie! This is Natalia, she lives upstairs. We got chatting so I made her a cup of tea. I hope you don’t mind.” I looked at the dark haired woman on the sofa, drinking tea from my cup and nodded. Georgia was a sociable idiot with no understanding of when to not be herself. I wasn’t going to lament her for it right now. It was her coping. \n\n“Of course. Hi Natalia, what flat do you live in?” I tried my very best to be polite. I would have to discuss not bringing people into my home mid tragedy with Georgia after she had left but until then I would be neighbourly.\n\n“Flat 71. It’s so nice to meet you, you have a lovely home.” Natalia responded, her lips curled at the corners into a smile that wasn’t replicated in her eyes or the rest of her facial expression. She looked at me smugly, with full knowledge that I was aware of the implications of what she had just said.\n\nThe rules...\n\nThe flat number....\n\n*every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\nPrue’s warning echoed in my mind and I couldn’t take my eyes off Natalia. Something really was off about her. I looked at Georgia sat on the sofa next to her and noticed her sweating. Anyone in the uk knows that it’s been a hot for few days but this was beyond just the ambient temperature. Her entire body was dripping. \n\nSuddenly, she began to pant. Natalia’s eyes were locked to mine just like the window cleaners had been. Nothing happened before with the cleaner, except this time the rule had been broken. She was already in the flat. \n\nGeorgia started to scream as her skin blistered and charred. Her hair fell from her scalp as the skin flaked and melted away from every inch of her. She was being burned alive without a flame in sight. She scratched frantically at her own melting face, digging into the exposed raw flesh. The sound a person makes when they burn alive is like no other. That will never leave me. \n\nI screamed and screamed but no one came to my door. I tried to grab my phone to call postman Ian but the wooden surface I had set it down on burned my fingers to the touch and forced me to recoil. She was going to set the whole flat alight. \n\nMy actions needed to be quicker than a phone call. \n\nI grabbed hold of the large knife I had set down on the side earlier when weaponising, the handle blistered my fingers instantly but I didn’t care, I needed to get her out now and help Georgia if I could. I ran towards the dark haired lady, sweat dripping from my brow the closer I got and plunged the knife into Natalia’s throat. She gripped it and fell to the floor. \n\nShe didn’t bleed like a normal human. Her insides were black, she was still moving, and I figured it probably wouldn’t be long before she stood right back up and tried again. So I dragged her into the hallway ready to bolt the door. \n\nAs we reached the entrance of the corridor one of the cats was waiting, hissing at her semi conscious body, I caught her eyes fixate on it as I dumped her on the floor. I grabbed the cat, pulled him inside, wincing as it’s skin caused more burns up my lower arms, shut the door and watched through the peep hole. She got up and held her hand to the wound, cauterising it and walking off towards the lift. As if she hadn’t been injured at all. \n\nI’d dropped the cat by that point but every bit of naked skin it had touched throbbed and burned for at least an hour. \n\nGeorgia hadn’t been as lucky as Natalia with injury recovery. I anonymously called an ambulance for her. I couldn’t believe it but she was still breathing. She was badly burned and her life wouldn’t be the same again but she was alive. And for that I was grateful. \n\nIt sounds awful but I left her at the park across the road from the building. With no phone or i.d. She’s my best friend and I want to be there but if I own up to involvement in injuries that bad they’ll suspect me, and I lose the already slim chance that Jamie might be saveable. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about Georgia, but she’s alive. I won’t believe Jamie isn’t until I see it. \n\nSo now I’m alone again, in the flat, conflicted about what to do. \n\nI want to leave. So badly. But this was mine and Jamie’s first home together. If he’s alive, and I can save him then I want it to be here for him to come back to... and if he’s dead, and the postman is right then I don’t know if I can leave his memory behind. \n\nThere’s only one person I think could help me right now. So tonight I’m going to do some research, hunt down an address and tomorrow morning I’m going to visit Prudence Hemmings.\n\nHow it went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cj2g4k\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"241":{"title":"Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the start of the pandemic.

He said the world was about to end and when we didn’t believe him, he told us to wake up. It was raining that day. I remember focusing on the water hitting the windowpanes while my sister tried to change Dad’s mind. I knew it was no use. He was too stubborn to listen to anyone except maybe Donald Trump. WHO had just declared that COVID-19 had pushed the world into a pandemic. Dad wanted us to join him and when we told him no, he called us brainwashed.\n\nHe purchased the land before I was born. Only because of the dilapidated military facility that came with it. It was abandoned sometime in the 60s, I think. My sister was there from the beginning, even before Dad’s obsession pushed Mom away. It’s hard for me to imagine what he was like back then. Mom says he was a gentleman. But they married young, and a person can change a lot during those years. And so did Dad. All I remember from him during childhood are the weekends at the bunker. Constantly renovating it and stockpiling it with everything he would need to survive down there.\n\nWe couldn’t stop him. He wasn’t the best Dad, not even a good one, but it was sad to see him go all the same. He was excited, even though he thought that civilization was about to collapse. I guess that happens when you’ve spent your entire adult life preparing. We had to set up an old radio to keep in touch with him. He didn’t trust mobile phones. We didn’t hear from him often, just once a month, sometimes less. The last time he radioed in, he said he had found a hidden door. He was going to see where it went. That was three months ago.\n\n“You think he’s okay?” my sister said. “He wasn’t in great health. I *told* him.”\n\nWe sat in the car, on our way to check up on him, driving through the heatwave.\n\n“His radio might have broken down,” I said. “Let’s not assume the worst.”\n\nBut I felt worried too. There was something strange about that hidden door, and his tone when he mentioned it. It didn’t sit right with me. But maybe it was just the heat and the endless desert around us that played tricks on my mind. I couldn’t really tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was dark when we arrived. Dad’s truck stood where he had left it, beneath some tarp that blew in the chilly, sand-carrying wind. We turned on our flashlights and walked to the cliff above the bunker. The steel door was made to withstand a nuclear blast. Luckily, I owned the only spare key in existence. Before I used it, I banged on the door as hard as I could and yelled for Dad. I worried he would mistake us for intruders and shoot us. If he was confused, and if it was dark, it was a real possibility. I banged again and yelled at the top of my lungs:\n\n“Dad, are you there? It’s me, Josh! Eveline is here as well!”\n\n“I don’t think he can hear you,” Eveline said.\n\nI nodded. “Dad! I’m going to open the door now!”\n\nI was seventeen the last time I was here. Back then it was the Muslims that were going to end civilization as we knew it. Before that, it was the Russians. Now it was China. There was always something threatening his beloved freedom, and yet he was never truly free. My sister put her hand on my wrist just as I was about to unlock the door.\n\n“You know,” she said. “Maybe we should just call the authorities after all and–”\n\n“No,” I said. “He’ll fight them.”\n\nI unlocked the heavy door. A rancid smell escaped the darkness inside. It was the odor of death. I recognized it from when Dad tried––and ultimately failed––to learn how to hunt and let a reindeer carcass rot on the property for weeks. My sister had already stopped visiting him by then. I didn’t tell her what the smell reminded me of. She covered her nose with her shirt. We descended the spiral stairs. It creaked for each step we took, almost as if it was about to fall apart.\n\nI tried the light switch at the bottom. The click echoed throughout the long corridor leading to the living area. Nothing happened.\n\n“Hm.” I realized that the batteries, which he charged by the use of an old exercise bike, were dead. That meant he was most likely dead as well. “The generator could be broken,” I said. “But… Maybe you should wait back here, just in case… you know.”\n\nI pointed my flashlight in front of me. The light was too weak to reach the end of the corridor. On the way here I had felt ready. I felt sad, the kind of empty sadness you feel after the death of a parent that was never any good, but I didn’t feel worried. Now, on the other hand, while staring into the dark corridor that I used to run through as a kid… I was afraid. The fear reminded me of how my childhood night terrors used to start. They always crept up on me in the darkness, grew with the grotesque shadows on my bedroom ceiling.\n\n“I’m not letting you go in there alone,” Eveline said. “We stay together.”\n\nWe walked into the darkness. The foul smell intensified for every step we took, and so did my heartbeat. I was glad my sister didn’t stay behind. The bunker seemed so much smaller than I remembered it, much more cramped. The asymmetry between my memories and reality made everything feel off somehow, just as if the bunker was merely a model of the real thing. But it wasn’t. I had just grown up.\n\nThe Confederate flag greeted us at the end of the corridor. It hung on the concrete wall. It looked pale in the hotspot of the flashlight, almost like a phantom. And, of course, in many ways it was. A ghost from a time long ago. Or perhaps a corpse brought back to life. An abomination. It reminded me of Dad more than anything else.\n\n“You have to be seriously confused to praise freedom as much as Dad and hang that symbol of lesser freedom in the world on your wall,” Eveline said.\n\n“He wanted to protect his freedom so much that he built a prison for himself.” I removed the light from the flag, leaving only darkness. “You bet he was confused.”\n\nWe entered the main chamber. It was overfilled with litter and clutter. Empty cans––both the food and beer kinds––lay scattered across the sticky floor. We had to take large steps not to step on any of the trash.\n\n“That’s weird.” Eveline pointed her flashlight at the small dining table. “Look.”\n\nMy hair stood up on my neck before I even realized what she meant. The table was set for three people. I didn’t say anything for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing, and just when I was about to speak my sister interrupted me:\n\n“Who the *fuck* was here with him?”\n\n“We don’t know–” I began. “I mean, he might have left the old plates on the table and–”\n\nA sound of something falling to the ground came from one of the other rooms further into the bunker. I pointed my light in its direction but couldn’t see what made it.\n\n“Dad!” I yelled. “It’s me, Josh! You there?”\n\nNo response.\n\n“I’m afraid,” Eveline whispered. “Something isn’t right.”\n\nI only vaguely heard what she said. My focus was on something else. Something on the wall on the other end of the room.\n\n“That’s not supposed to be there.” I slowly walked toward it. “That must have been what he talked about over the radio.”\n\nDad had hacked away a layer of concrete, for whatever reason, and uncovered a rusty, metal door behind it. It stood ajar. A lukewarm, musty breeze came out of it. My sister walked up to me as I carefully pried the door open with the back of my flashlight. I felt my heart in my throat. I could hear my sister begging for us to leave, almost in tears. But I needed to know what was behind that door. It was imperative to understand what had happened here. I needed to know. I needed closure.\n\n“What in heavens name…” Eveline looked over my shoulder. “Why is this here?”\n\nBehind the door was a room about the size of a broom cupboard. It was unremarkable except for a circular hole in the middle of the floor. I shone my light into it, but I couldn’t see the bottom. Just as I thought it was big enough for a person, my sister said:\n\n“Do you think he fell?”\n\nDrops of sweat from my forehead fell down the pit. I felt dizzy and stepped back, afraid I would fall inside. My sister picked up a can filled with some rotten beans and threw it down the hole. It clattered against the walls as it bounced from one side to another. The sound faded away until we couldn’t hear it anymore. There was no indication it touched down at the bottom. I stretched out my hand and held it above the opening.\n\n“It’s warm,” I said. “The air, I mean.”\n\n“Maybe he fell.” Eveline stepped back, almost as if she were convinced. “Can we please get out of here?” She reached for my arm. “We can return with the police. Please… Josh?”\n\n“It wasn’t dark when Dad found this,” I said. “He would have seen the hole.”\n\n“Josh? Please.”\n\n“Just give me a moment to think.” I walked toward the hallway that led to the other rooms, desperately hoping to find him. For some reason, it was important for me to see him. To be able to leave without wondering. I needed to know that he was truly dead. “I just want to–” I stopped myself after I accidentally pointed the flashlight on the floor in the middle of the hallway, revealing a pair of feet. “I think I found him!” I ran up to the body.\n\n“Wait!” Eveline yelled and reluctantly followed me to avoid being left alone.\n\nIt wasn’t Dad. I screamed upon the realization. My mind couldn’t comprehend what I had just seen. I spun around and tried to run away, completely acting on instinct, and crashed into my sister. She grabbed me, kept me still, and as she looked behind me, down at the dead body on the floor, she began to cry while her hands trembled uncontrollably against my shoulders.\n\n“Oh my God,” she said. “How… how is it possible? It’s you!”\n\n“Let’s get a fuck out of here,” I said. “Move!”\n\nThere was nothing that could explain this, and the more my mind tried to––moving in an endless loop doing so––the dread grew inside me. I only got a glimpse of the body before I panicked, but my sister was right. The half-rotten face was the same as mine, with a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead.\n\nWe stumbled our way through the living area, tipping over chairs and kicking cans all over the place, and just as we were about to get out of the mess a familiar voice echoed through the hallway we had just escaped.\n\n“Josh!”\n\nIt was Dad. We both stopped in our tracks.\n\n“Is that you? Josh!”\n\n“Dad?” I yelled back. “What the fuck is going on here?”\n\n“Don’t worry!” It sounded like he was at the other end of the bunker, possibly inside the storeroom. “I killed the son of a bitch, put a bullet right between his eyes!”\n\n“Come out from there!” I yelled. “We have to leave, it’s not safe here!”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Something is wrong,” Eveline said. “I don’t think–”\n\n“Dad!” I yelled. “Come out!”\n\n“I can’t move!” Dad said. “I’m stuck under a shelf! I’ll need your help, son!”\n\nI turned to my sister. “Go back up. I’ll get that old bastard out of there. We’ll be right behind you, okay?”\n\n“Think, Josh!” Eveline begged. “You think he’s been stuck under a shelf for–”\n\nI should have listened, but even after what we had just seen I just couldn’t bring myself to even consider something as outlandish as what my sister was suggesting. It was simply too far-fetched, too unbelievable to penetrate all my layers of presumptions about reality. It couldn’t be, it just couldn’t. Hence, I ran back to the hallway, yelling for my sister to get back up to the surface and wait for us there.\n\n“I’m coming, Dad!”\n\nI only slowed down to carefully step over the corpse that bore my face. Perhaps, I thought, it was just a coincidence. A burglar that just happened to look like me. After all, the face had begun to rot. It wasn’t obviously me. I felt stupid and I almost convinced myself that it was just my childhood fear of the dark coming back to life down here. And then, just as I was about to walk past the small composting toilet that stood inside a small room at the end of the hallway, I stopped. Shivers spread across my entire body, paralyzing me. Dad sat on the toilet. His gun still hung from his trigger finger and his brain was splattered across the wall behind him. He had his journal in his lap, covered in blood.\n\n“Josh!” Dad yelled from the darkness. “Help me!”\n\nI was frozen in place, both by fear and confusion, unable to make any decisions.\n\n“Come on, Josh!” Dad kept yelling. “I need your help, son!”\n\nMy mind was racing. There was no way of knowing who was who. When I heard Dad’s voice yelling for help while watching his dead body, nothing but absolute terror revibrated inside me. I slowly reached for the journal in Dad’s lap and grabbed it, hoping it would shed some light on the situation. I was just about to open it when my sister screamed. I ran back, this time jumping over my doppelgänger's body, and found her looking at something at the corner of the main chamber.\n\n“I told you to–” I said, but changed my mind. “Are you okay, what happened?”\n\n“It’s–” she cried. “It’s me.”\n\nCrawled up in the corner was her naked, dead body. Her head had been twisted in such a way that the neck had been broken.\n\n“There’s something seriously wicked going on here,” I said. “Dad shot himself in the head, a long time ago by the looks of it, and yet he keeps yelling for help. Let’s get back to the car, now!”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe drove away from the bunker as fast as we could, leaving whatever was still alive down there yelling for help. My sister insisted on staying at my place for a few days. I didn’t mind having her around. We shared an experience no one else could relate to, and we needed each other to overcome the trauma.\n\nIt took a day for me to build up the courage to open Dad’s journal. It began with his usual deranged conspiracy theories. I flipped past them. At the end, he had only made short notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Found a hidden door.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Deep pit, possible the remains of some old black project.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Eveline and Josh woke me up. A “surprise visit”. Didn’t hear them enter. Strange.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Had dinner with them, something seems off.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*It isn’t them! They tried to make me* \\[Illegible\\]*!!!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*God help me, it isn’t them!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I shot the son of a bitch right between the eyes!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Hiding in the bathroom now, this will probably be my last entry.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*God forgive me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChills went down my spine as I read the last entry on the blood-drenched page.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I never got the other one. She’s still out there somewhere. I only got one bullet left. I won’t allow her to do that abhorrent thing to me. Forgive me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been cooking for hours. She just called for me from the kitchen:\n\n“Josh? Come here, I want to show you something!”\n\n[ME](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tobiasmalm\/comments\/112r4le\/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another\/)"},"242":{"title":"I volunteered to sit next to a dead man on a plane, and deeply regret it.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dnsoza\/i_volunteered_to_sit_next_to_a_dead_man_on_a\/","flair":null,"author":"diesindarkness","selftext":"The man in seat 43-A died halfway across the Atlantic. I was sitting near the front of the plane, just behind first class, and couldn’t really see the commotion. But I could hear someone gasping and retching — loud at first, then quieter and quieter. A flight attendant got on the PA and asked for “any medical professionals among the passengers” to help. I guess there were none. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the man’s sounds deteriorated into a sort of gurgle, then silence, then it was over.\n\nHis name was Molyneaux, and he was old but not that old, and it was likely a heart attack, aneurism, drug reaction or God’s will, according to conflicting nth-hand reports that filtered down the plane from row 43, where a flight attendant simply buckled the newly deceased back into his window seat and covered his face with a complementary airline blanket.\n\nThe pilot got on the intercom and told us the plane would be turning back to New York “due to a tragic medical situation involving one of our passengers.”\n\n“Folks, we’re looking for a volunteer willing to sit next to the deceased while we return to our originating airport,” the pilot continued. “This flight is entirely full, and the person sitting there now isn’t feeling comfortable. It’s an aisle seat, and it will only be a few hours before we’re back over land.”\n\nI’m not sure why I volunteered — probably some combination of exhaustion, altruism and morbid curiosity. My vacation plans were shot anyway, I figured, so why not take the most interesting seat on the plane? The flight attendant thanked me profusely, as did a queasy looking teenager who took my original seat. I picked up my handbag and shuffled down the aisle to the very last row of the plane.\n\nMy only prior experience with corpses was an open casket funeral for my grandmother when I was a kid, but the idea of death had never particularly bothered me. It’s natural, after all. That said, I admit that I second-guessed my decision as soon as I saw my new seat mate.\n\nMr. Molyneaux, rest in peace, sat upright between the window and me, strapped around the waist, with a blue fleece blanket covering his torso and head. The blanket did not cover his hands, which were resting on his lap above his seatbelt — placed that way by a flight attendant as a sign of respect, I assumed. \n\nMolyneaux’s pale fingers were twisted into claws that betrayed the agony of his death. I couldn’t look at those hands without imagining what his face looked like under the blanket.\n\nI thought of asking for a second blanket, but the flight crew was still busy calming down other passengers and preparing for our u-turn around the Atlantic Ocean. So I tried to forget my uneasiness and closed my eyes, and slept.\n\nI woke — hours or minutes later, I don’t know — to the jostling of turbulence. The cabin lights were off and most of the passengers around me seemed to be sleeping. I looked out the window, trying not to look at Molyneaux as I did so, and saw only the uniform blackness of the night. I imagined the ocean miles below us, lightless and cold. The thought unsettled me and I reached across Molyneaux to close the window shade.\n\nThen I stopped myself. *Hadn’t the shade been closed when I sat down?*\n\nI realized there was something else off about the scene. Molyneaux’s posture had somehow changed while I slept. It took me a few seconds to pinpoint it. His gnarled hands remained on his lap, he was still belted at the waist, and the blanket still shrouded his upper body. But the fabric looked somehow twisted now, as if he had been fidgeting.\n\nVery slowly — knowing it was insane even as I knew I couldn’t stop myself — I lifted a corner the blanket. \n\nI uncovered his shirt, which the flight crew had unbuttoned while trying to save him. A patch of blue-grey skin sprouting white chest hair peeked out from it.\n\nI lifted the blanket higher. His collar was flecked with dried blood. I remembered his terrible gasping.\n\nFinally, I pulled the blanket entirely off, and stifled a scream.\n\nMolyneaux’s head was turned away from me, exactly as if he had turned to stare out the window. \n\nI could see his face reflected in the plexiglass. It was undoubtably a dead man’s face: pale, drawn, lips parted, jaw slack. There was no life in it.\n\nExcept his eyes. They were moving.\n\nI stared at the reflection for half a minute and I’m sure of it. In the center of that death mask, two pupils flicked back and forth, as if tracking something out there in the sky.\n\n“What are you doing?” a voice beside me interrupted. I whipped around and saw the woman seated across the aisle staring at me — not so much in fear as disgust. “Cover him back up! Give him his peace.”\n\n“He’s … I think he’s been moving,” I stammered. “His eyes. I think he might not actually be ….” \n\nBut I couldn’t finish the sentence; it was too crazy. Nor did I have to, because at that moment my stomach dropped ten feet along with everything else in the plane. \n\nCoffee cups and purses slammed against the ceiling. A man near the first class section nearly tumbled out of his seat. I heard call lights going off all over the plane as passengers were jolted awake in panic and confusion.\n\n“Passengers, please take your seats, buckle in, and secure any loose items,” the pilot said over the PA, sounding shaken himself. “The weather along our flight path is clear and no planes in the area are reporting turbulence, so I’m not sure what this is. But we should be through it momentarily.”\n\nEven as he spoke, the mild background shaking I’d felt since waking up became noticeably more violent. The woman across the aisle began fumbling for her seatbelt, no longer paying any attention to me or Molyneaux.\n\nI forced myself to look at him again. The jolt must have caused him to pitch forward at the waist, his head colliding with the seat in front of him. \n\nBut Molyneaux’s face was still turned toward the window — his neck twisted at such a sharp angle that I worried it had snapped.\n\nI looked at his hands again, and the pallor of his skin. Three flight attendants and a dozen passengers had witnessed this man’s death, and I could not rationally imagine they were mistaken. \n\nAnd yet in the reflection of the window, his eyes left to right, left to right.\n\nI had heard that strange reflexes sometimes kick in after death — limbs flailing, headless chickens running, nerves clearing out the last backlog of instructions from the brain. But the eyes? I had never heard of that.\n\nI made myself look past that unsettling reflection, at the sky itself. It was still dark, moonless and cloudless, but the atmosphere seemed to have taken on a strange hue — a very dark green, like pea soup fog. I thought I could see vague shapes swirling around in the murk, though it might have been an optical illusion. I recoiled.\n\nI desperately wanted to be anywhere else right then, but the rest of the cabin was approaching a state a pandemonium. Flight attendants were hurrying up and down the aisles, attending to spills and bruises, even as they tripped and staggered. The entire plane was shuddering like a barrel going down the rapids. \n\nA series of jolts sent Molyneaux’s upper body swinging back and forth like an upside down pendulum. He was thrown backward into his seat, then sideways into me (a horrible feeling I will never forget), and then the opposite way, his face slamming directly into the window, where it came to rest.\n\nThat was enough for me. I unbuckled, leapt out of my seat and locked myself in the bathroom directly behind me. I would cower on a toilet for the rest of this hellish flight rather than spend another minute sitting with Mr. Molyneaux.\n\nThis plan worked for a half hour or so. I braced both my arms against the bathroom’s walls and listened to the chimes of flight attendant call buttons, the whine of jet engines and the growling of the sky. I tried to calm myself by visualizing the skyline of New York, the JFK air strip, a calm descent.\n\nBut then I imagined Molyneaux’s window, his face mashed up against the glass like a little boy’s, his dead eyes searching the night.\n\nThe captain’s disembodied voice called me back to reality. He sounded outright scared now, and the PA kept cutting in and out.\n\n“ … extremely anomalous weather … need everyone in their seats in the emergency position … immediately … if we depressurize … ”\n\nThe turbulence stopped for four or five seconds, and then suddenly it felt like I was inside a washing machine. I bounced against the walls of the bathroom, landed on the floor, and could barely manage to get the door open and crawl on all fours into the aisle.\n\nAll three flight attendants were down, sprawled on backs and bellies between the seats. Some of the overhead luggage bins had burst open and spewed baggage out. Many of the passengers were weeping. A few prayed. And through it all, the plane would not stop shaking.\n\nI heard a series of small bangs above my head and felt something wet on my cheek. Every single soda can in the galley had exploded. I climbed into my seat and belted myself in, having briefly forgotten about Molyneaux in my terror.\n\nTHWACK THWACK\n\nBut he was still in his seat of course, whipping back and forth like a flagpole in a hurricane, head-butting the window so hard that I could see the plexiglass balloon outwards and rebound each time. \n\nTHWACK\n\nI became worried he’d crack the window, though that’s supposed to be impossible, so I overcame my revulsion and grabbed his shoulders. But I couldn’t restrain him. \n\nAgain and again, his head hit the window. I began to fear that it was not simply the motion of the plane that compelled him. \n\nTHWACK THWACK THWACK\n\nNo one else on the plane was watching this. Some of the passengers had rallied and were trying to pull the injured flight attendants out of the aisle. Others were whispering goodbye messages into their phones.\n\nTHWACK THWACK KRKRRRRR\n\nI heard something crack beside me, and hoped desperately that it was Molyneaux’s skull, and not the window. Outside I could see that the green fog was alive with swirling, amorphous shapes.\n\nTHWACK KRKRRRR KRKOOM KRKOOM\n\nAnother explosion. Not pop cans this time, but pressurized oxygen escaping into sky. Molyneaux had managed to smash out both window panes in one, final blow. Now his mangled head was hanging outside the plane, and the rest of his body was straining to follow it, restrained only by his seatbelt and the width of his shoulders.\n\nAn alarm went off in the cabin, and a jungle of oxygen masks fell from the ceilings. I put mine on at once, but heard other people screaming. Some passengers were trying desperately to get masks on the unconscious air crew, but the plane was shaking more violently than ever, and loose debris was flying up the aisles toward my row — toward the hole a dead man had made in the airplane.\n\n“… cabin breach…” said the pilot. “… limited backup oxygen, so I’m trying to descend to a safe altitude … but hard to do that in this storm, or whatever it is … God be with us.”\n\nOnce I was sure that I could breath and was no in danger of being sucked out myself, I took one last look at Molyneaux. His head might have torn clean off outside the window, for all I could see of it past the rest of his body. \n\nI pictured those eyes again, which had seen something in the sky that we had not seen — could not see, even as it now threatened to shake the plane apart. There was some connection between these events that I might never understand. But even without understanding, I could make the last move available to me.\n\nI reached over Molyneaux’s lap, lifted one of those cold, clawed hands, and unclasped his seatbelt.\n\nThere was an intolerable crunching noise as, I presume, his shoulders were squeezed and crushed to fit the window frame. And then in a split second he was gone — out the window, into the night, a pale old man falling end over end toward the black ocean.\n\n“Whatever you saw out there,” I whispered. “Whatever you were looking for, go to it and leave us be.”\n\nThe green fog lifted a few minutes later, and the plane descended until it was safe to breath without the masks. Less than an hour later, I really did see the JFK airstrip. A whole squadron of police and ambulances met us on the way down. The flight attendants and several passengers had to be hospitalized, but as far as I know no one suffered serious injuries. \n\nFederal investigators eventually concluded that we had flown through a localized weather anomaly — witnessed by no other plane in the sky that night. Some sort of debris must have been flying around up there with us and taken out the window at 43-A, they wrote in their report: “This event led to a sudden loss of cabin pressure, in which the body of a passenger who had died earlier in an unrelated medical emergency was ejected from the plane.”  \n\nI expected to hear a lot more about it on the news, but I suppose in the end it was just one of those things. The airline had no interest in publicizing the incident, of course, and the passengers had no desire to relive it. \n\nFor most people on the flight, it was simply a freak tragedy followed by a close call, and all’s well that ends well. I’m the only one that will dream for the rest of my life about Molyneaux’s eyes, and what they saw on the way to the ocean."},"243":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The lack of sleep is making me wonder whether all these things happening are in my mind or not. But I’m reminded every time I see that damn note that it’s all real. \n\nI spent hours last night searching for anything I could about Prudence Hemmings. If she had lived in a big creepy mansion I imagine she would have been easy to find. But us folk who live in tower blocks aren’t so well documented. No one cares about our lives, no matter how extraordinary.\n\nI found an article about missing person Lyla Hemmings. It suggested that she went missing under the care of her grandmother while playing in the park opposite the flats early in the morning. Interviews with her parents stated that they had both disowned Prudence. \n\nDespite the many years that had passed since Lyla’s death\/disappearance her parents appeared to have remained unforgiving of Prue. There was no mention of her on either of their social media accounts and she appeared to have no involvement with the children they had acquired since. \n\nSearches for the Hemmings family in the local area were equally dead ends, I looked at link after link, desperate to find something but they all started to blur into one. Until finally I saw something. \n\nAn obituary for Bernard “Bernie” Hemmings, who had fallen from the tower block in unexplained circumstances after being diagnosed with dementia months before his death. I was surprised it hadn’t made bigger news. It had only been about a year. There were no details of where to find them, but his wife Prudence and her sister Bridget were listed as contacts to get find out details of the funeral. \n\nIt’s scary what you can do with the internet these days, but just with those phone numbers I was able to put them into a reverse directory and find an address for Bridget and Tony Bishop, the sister and brother in law that Prudence was supposedly living with.\n\nAbout 4am I managed to get some sleep, not much though, I was back up and wide awake at around 7am, planning my route and working out my day. I saw a post on social media from one of her relatives that Georgia was identified and is stable. This loosened the knot in my stomach that has been present since I found the note somewhat. \n\nAt 8.50, I opened the door to my flat hoping to see postman Ian. 4 minutes passed and instead of the postman an elderly gentleman made his way down the corridor. He had a walking stick and kind eyes. In his free arm he carried a small plastic bag containing a newspaper and milk, he smiled and said “good morning” as he passed.\n\nI smiled back. He reminded me of my grandad. I imagined him pulling cola cubes from his pocket for his grandkids and shushing them when their parents weren’t looking. A little further down the corridor the old man stopped and turned. He looked me dead in the eyes with a sympathetic expression and spoke.\n\n“No post on a Sunday, if that’s what you were waiting for.” He smiled knowingly and turned to unlock a front door that until shut I couldn’t see the number of. When I saw the door close and the number 48 boldly displayed above the peephole I understood what Prudence had meant. Mr Prentice did seem to be a lovely chap. \n\nI sat back in my flat and sighed, staring at the various tabs open on my laptop. At about 9.15 the knocking on the balcony door started.\n\nThe window cleaner was back.\n\nI didn’t feel half as terrified as I had the first time, if anything, I was just angry. It took every ounce of restraint I had in my tired body not to engage with him, if only to tell him to fuck off. His genuine seeming requests just irritated me. After about 20 minutes of being watched the knocking started to give me a headache, so I grabbed a bag and left the flat.\n\nI decided there was no time like the present. If I was going to turn up on the Bishops’ doorstep looking for her sister because of the freaky flat she’s left behind then I had to get it over with. If the address was old, or the bishops weren’t the people I was looking for then I was going to look stupid whatever time of day I went.\n\nAnd I couldn’t take the window cleaners eyes anymore. There was something about them, they really do make you want to open that door. \n\nI looked at the lift as I entered the communal hallway and decided today I would take the stairs. I couldn’t stand to be in a small box that my partner probably died very painfully in. My heart dropped into my stomach just at the sight of it.\n\nThe stairs were as grotty as the lift. We’d taken them multiple times on move in day but I hadn’t really taken it in the same way I could now. I thought about the rules and all the strange things happening in this building. I looked at the badly painted numbers on the walls as I reached each landing.\n\nNothing in this building is simple.\n\nI looked at the numbers. 7, 6, 5 ... 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, G. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation but my legs were in agreement with my mind that I had definitely just descended more than 6 flights of stairs. They’d glitched. \n\nI looked at the dusty and poorly lit stairwell from the bottom. It seemed dark despite the sun pouring in from the glass panel in the main building doors. The note never mentioned glitchy stairs, maybe I really was losing my mind. \n\nAs I turned to exit the building a woman walked in. She was in her late thirties to early forties and had 2 small children in tow. One boy and one girl. I guessed that they were twins, they were both incredibly blonde, with deep brown puppy dog looking eyes and couldn’t have been any older than 6-7. They were as close to identical as it gets in twins of different genders. I’m not a fan of kids, but they were super cute. \n\nThe lady had a short bob haircut that got longer at the front, it was uniform and dyed a perfectly even auburn colour. I knew it was dyed because her roots were blonde like her kids. She looked as tired as I felt, but she pulled herself together when she saw me, running fingers through s part of her hair that she must have missed how ever early she left this morning. \n\n“Hi, are you here visiting?” Who opened with, trying to make small talk. \n\n“No, I just moved in to flat 42, on the 7th floor, I was just leaving actually. Whereabouts are you?” I was desperate to go, I had feared myself up to see Prue but I didn’t want to be rude.\n\n“I’m flat 26, my name’s Terri. This is Eddie and Ellie.” She gestured to the two small children hiding shyly behind her skirt. “Welcome to the block. If you ever need anything please feel free to give me a shout.”\n\n“My name is Katie but people call me Kat too. That’s really kind of you, thank you. I will.... hey, is there something wrong with the stairs?” I stopped myself before going into detail.\n\n“Nothing wrong, they just skip sometimes.” She answered, shrugging. \n\n“Well I’d love to stop and chat but I actually really need to get going. It was nice to meet you Terri.” I tried to work out what was wrong with the children as I stepped forward to walk away. Still baffled by the stairs.\n\n“By the way, we have a residents committee, you should come to one of our meetings, they’re every Tuesday in alternating flats. This Tuesday is at Molly Jefferson’s place in flat 31, come along. We’d love to have you!” Terri suggested, waving me off. \n\nI walked out the doors after my encounter with Terri feeling sick. Every minute in this place made the note more real. Every word jumped off the page and into my life. Made it more likely that Jamie was really gone. \n\nI rode the bus from a stop not far from the flats. It felt like it took and eternity to reach the little suburban area I was looking for. A five minute walk away from the bus stop I got off at and I was staring at a quaint little bungalow, belonging to Bridget and Tony Bishop. \n\nI knocked on the door. The lady who opened it was unsteady on her feet, she was probably in her 70s, with wispy white hair neatly scraped back into a bun, two strands left hanging that just softened her wrinkled face. She wore a dusty rose coloured dress that hung just below her knees and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. \n\n“Can I help you?” She asked bluntly.\n\n“My name is Kat. I’m looking for Prudence Hemmings.” I answered, stuttering slightly. \n\nHer eyes widened slightly.\n\n“Why?” She asked, bizarrely. \n\n“Is she here? It’s private.” \n\nThe lady ushered me into the house, and sat me down on a sofa, within minutes there was a cup of tea in front of me. She didn’t say anything to me for a while, we just looked at each other. Then she finally broke the silence. \n\n“I wondered if you’d try and find me. It took me a long time to decide whether to leave that note or not but I decided that you deserved a head start. That’s more than I ever got.”\n\nThe woman was Prudence, she was nothing like I had imagined. She seemed tough and hardened and spoke with a mostly blunt tone, she contributed before I could answer.\n\n“Terri called me not long ago. Told me that she had met the new tenant. She said you looked shaken up, and said that my note may not have been enough. I did say I couldn’t fit everything on there. And the stairs didn’t seem too important. The committee wanted to organise a meeting with you on your moving in day but I told them that was intrusive. The whole committee thing always seemed a bit excessive to me anyway.” She spoke flippantly, like it was nothing. \n\n“It may have been intrusive, but we needed a warning, we spent a night in the place before I found your note! My boyfriend had already left for work at 3.15 and taken the lift.... he didn’t know.” I broke as I told her what had happened. Her face dropped. And so did my hope for Jamie. \n\n“I’m so sorry... I really don’t know what to say. I thought my note would reach you in time.” She mumbled, her face to the floor, refusing to look at me as tears streamed down my face.\n\n“He’s gone isn’t he. I didn’t want to accept it but I spoke to the postman and your face says all it needs to. The postman said there might be a way I can have him back.” I bit at her, devastated and angry.\n\n“He’s gone. You can’t have him back. What Ian is referring to isn’t what you think. There’s a way to get people back from the lift. But not as themselves. Trust me, I learned the hard way. Once they’re back you can’t reverse it. I’m sorry about your man. But he’s gone forever. Don’t dig into the other way, to be gone forever is luckier than that alternative.” She still wouldn’t look up from the floor.\n\n“What do you mean...”\n\n“I don’t want to talk about it. I said in the note that there are things I’d rather not discuss and I need you to respect that or I won’t be speaking to you at all. Now move on and ask what you need to ask.” Prudence cut me off, I decided not to push the topic further, and moved on to some other things I needed to know.\n\n“What’s the deal with Terri’s kids? They seem sweet and normal.”\n\n“Those little demon creatures are anything but normal.” She answered, wincing slightly at the though of them. “When she went into labour Terri never made it to a hospital. They were the first children ever to be born inside the building and with everything that goes on it’s like something’s rubbed off on them. They’re average children in the daytime, but they never sleep, ever. Poor Terri hasn’t had a days rest since they were born. They also really love to steal birds and rats they find the cats playing with and torment them. Really annoys the cats.” \n\nAs she finished speaking a small hairless cat strutted out from behind an armchair across the room, meowing softly. It brushed its head up against Prue’s exposed legs, leaving scorch marks where it touched. She didn’t react, she reached down and stroked the top of its head, smiling as it purred. \n\n“And those?” I asked, eyes stuck to her now badly burned legs. \n\nShe chuckled, pulled out a box and lit a cigarette, tapping the top layer of ash into a small silver dish in front of her. She offered me one and I took it gladly. \n\n“They’ve always been my good friends. I couldn’t leave the building without bringing a part of home with me. This little guy is Damon. He’s seen some things.” She gushed, not taking her eyes off the cat. \n\n“But where did they come from, why are they everywhere?” I asked, watching in disbelief as her burns subsided. It seemed impossible, but I looked at my arms where I had picked up the cat the night before and there was no evidence it had ever happened. They didn’t even appear sunburnt. \n\n“No one really knows. They started to appear after the fire, a few years after I’d moved in. It was rumoured that they were the pets of the residents that burned, and that was why they had no fur. But I don’t think that’s true.”\n\nI interrupted.\n\n“I met one of those neighbours last night. She said her name was Natalia. She almost killed my best friend. You’re crazy if you think your note was enough of a warning!” I ranted emotionally.\n\n“Look, girl. If I had made a song and dance about warning you, then you’d have thought me crazy and challenged the rules. You’d have been dead already. Be grateful you got anything. I didn’t. I had to work it all out. Your generation are so spoiled.” She tutted in frustration at me. I was angry, but she was probably right. An elderly lady telling me rat like creatures would kill my boyfriend in a lift would probably have got some laughs from me a few days ago. I stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down, after a while she sighed and started again.\n\n“I think the cats are the neighbours that burned. They’ve never meant any harm and they hiss and run from the imposters that roam the building. Besides, there’s no way there were that many cats living on one floor. \n\nThe imposter people don’t even match up with the residents that died in the fire, none of them look like, or claim to have the same name as the dead. They just claim to live in their flats. I’ve met Natalia before, she left a bad scar on Bernie’s leg from an incident we had, nasty girl. \n\nBefore the fire there was cctv and there was a recording saved of about 15 people marching into the flats and up to that floor about half an hour before the fire started. It was the only evidence found. CCTV wasn’t great in the eighties so they were never identified. And the flames melted the relevant cameras so nothing ever came of it. \n\nI think the people that entered that night are the ones that ask for sugar. I don’t know any more than that but if you avoid them like I said you don’t need to know more. They hate the cats. I hope your friend survives, but I’ve seen what those people can do so maybe she was better off dead.” Prue carried on stroking Damon. I watched the skin of her fingers melt and twist as they made contact with him.\n\n“What happened to your husband?” \n\nI asked the question so fast I didn’t have time to consider that this was a topic she had explicitly said she didn’t want to discuss in the note. But I had to know. \n\nShe scowled at me. “I said I didn’t want to talk about that.” She hissed.\n\n“I just lost the love of my life. I need some answers.” I begged.\n\n“What happened to Bernie won’t help you. I know you’d think any deaths in that building would be down to the quirks but this wasn’t. For the most part anyway.\n\nDon’t forget that we had lived there for 35 years, Bernie knew the rules, we knew how to take care of ourselves and have a happy life there. It was our home.”\n\n“I don’t doubt that’s Mrs Hemmings, I’m sorry” I interjected.\n\n“Bernie had dementia. It started about 6 months before he died and he deteriorated very rapidly. Towards the end he started wandering, the doctors said it was common, but in our position it was incredibly dangerous. More times than I can count I pulled him away from the lift just in time.\n\nAlong with wandering he was forgetting the rules. He let that smug awful window cleaner in 3 times, thank lord for the big metal pipe I kept by the balcony door, chased him out a treat. Not that anything stops him from coming back. I’m sure you’re already acquainted. \n\nAfter all the dangerous situations Bernie was in, by the end he made the smallest and most fatal of errors. \n\nHe left a bowl of food out for Damon at 10am. I was out shopping with Terri and a few of the girls from the committee and when I came back I found one of those awful creatures...” \n\nPrudence started to cry. I put my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her, after all, I truly knew how she felt. \n\n“It was eating him.” She sniffed and steadied herself to continue, moving my hand. “I chased the creature away with the same metal pipe I had the window cleaner and pushed Bernie off the balcony. He was heavy but I didn’t want anyone to know what really killed him. It’s teeth..” she shivered “...they made such an awful noise. It reminded me of -“\n\n“Lyla.” I finished her sentence. I hadn’t meant to. I was so invested in her story I couldn’t help it. \n\n“I gather you spoke with Ian then.” She said sounding resigned. “I never meant to hurt that little girl. I loved her so much.” Tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks. Damon, who was now sat next to her on the sofa, shuffled closer as if to cuddle her. \n\n“Haven’t you ever been curious about getting her back?” I asked, my mind turning back to the methods hinted at by both Prue and the postman. “I miss Jamie so much. I’d do anything to get him back.”\n\nHer face filled with a look of horror and shame. “Of course I have.” She answered, “which is exactly why I’m telling you not to.” \n\nBut I couldn’t let it go. \n\n“Surely anything must be better than gone forever?” I pestered. I wish I hadn’t.\n\nPrudence, frustrated, stood up and gestured for me to follow, she lead me outside to the back garden of the bungalow. At the back was a large shed, the kind people used for a man cave or a summer house. It was pretty, the sun shone down on it lighting up the few cobwebs in the corners and making them twinkle. \n\nMrs Hemmings was careful to look into both neighbouring gardens to ensure there was no one around before she unlocked the door to the shed. We stepped inside and the first thing to hit me was the smell, it was putrid, like rotting meat. I looked at the floor and covered my nose with my hands, staring back at me was a pool of blood.\n\nI followed the blood with my eyes as Prudence locked us in the shed. Then after I made it past the animal bones I finally saw it.\n\nJust like postman Ian had described.\n\nOne of the creatures was watching me, from a heavy duty metal dog cage in the corner of the shed. It looked reinforced but still the metal had chew marks. Their jaws had to be strong to cause that.\n\nThat didn’t surprise me looking at it, it’s rodent like nose and beady, yet somehow human like  eyes were nothing compared to the two very visible rows of jagged sharp teeth that lined each gum. Despite its small stature, it was terrifying. \n\nPrudence opened a drawer in a dusty cupboard across the room and pulled out a can of dog food, she poured the contents into the bowl  and passed the bowl through the feeding hatch. The cage had a safety feature meaning the animal couldn’t access the food until the hatch was locked from the outside. I was grateful for this.\n\nPrue turned to me and spoke. She brushed one of the two strands of hair framing her face behind her ear. Gesturing to the hideous creature she said;\n\n“Kat, I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter, Lyla.”\n\nHow the conversation went on : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjintp\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"244":{"title":"I have an unusual job.

She didn’t flinch, which meant she thought I had a lot to offer. \n\nPretty little thing, she was. Nearly thirty years old, though I’d estimate the age of her modified chest to be about three. Her good looks stemmed mainly from the fact that she’d clearly avoided a lifetime of hard work. I probably would have been equally attractive twenty-five years ago had my twin passions been vanity and stupidity.\n\nThis gal was taken care of.\n\nHer expression glazed for just a moment. I noticed.\n\n“No,” she offered timidly, “it’s nothing like that.” She looked up at me with wide eyes that had been conditioned to elicit sympathy. I noticed. \n\n“It’s just…” she bit her lip. “It’s just that Raymond’s been gone a month – but I don’t think that he’s *gone* gone, you know? I want to know if I should put him behind me, or…” She shed a tear. “It started out small. His favorite sweater would be hanging in the closet, but the next morning, it was lying on the bedroom floor. Not a big deal, you know?” She looked around conspiratorially, despite the fact that no one was in the brightly lit sun porch besides the two of us. \n\nAs if sensing my thought, Sophocles rubbed up against my skirt. I reached down and scratched his ear without turning away from my client. She stared right back at me, looking over the swirling vapor dancing from the teapot’s spout. \n\n“But then,” she breathed, flushing slightly pink, “I would be, ah, in an intimate moment-”\n\n“Masturbating, or fucking?” I asked bluntly.\n\nHer pink face quickly turned crimson. “Um, the first one. I’d hear a sudden banging on my bedroom door. It would go away whenever I stopped… what I was doing.”\n\n“What makes you think it’s your dead husband?” I pressed her, crushing my cigarette and lighting a new one.\n\nShe gazed down at the table. “He would *always* interrupt me. Even if it wasn’t… about anything naughty.” She looked up at me in desperation. “It just *feels* like him. Does that make any sense?” She bit her lip again. I noticed. “But the worst thing was last night. That’s what made me decide that it was time to talk with a… *professional.*”\n\nGod, her little pauses and cute blushing were irritating. I really wanted to slap her. \n\n“Explain,” I ordered cavalierly before taking in that first drag.\n\nA long pull of the cigarette really makes people like her worth it. What was her name? Cindy? She seemed like a Cindy. But the Cindys of the world always scatter from my mind for *just* a few seconds during that first sensual puff. In those moments, I feel so *capable.*\n\n“Last night-”\n\nI coughed. Reality set back in. “Listen, Cindy-”\n\n“It’s Anne-Samantha.”\n\n“You must have jilled off thousands of times in your life-”\n\n“I’m sorry… ‘jilled’?”\n\n“Well, are you a Jack from the waist down?”\n\nShe laid a dainty little hand right on her mouth. “Oh… my, no. I’m all Jill, I suppose.”\n\nI grunted. “So what’s so different about jilling off now?”\n\nHer eyes got wide again, but I had learned long ago to suppress the slap-urge. “When I’m alone in bed, I hear breathing. *Only* when I’m alone. It’s unmistakable.”\n\n“Well, how hard are you working?” I asked pointedly.\n\nShe dropped the hand from her face. “The breathing is coming from the other side of the room.”\n\nI gave her an unblinking, fixed stare. She returned it.\n\nI finally turned away when a lump of ash fell from my cigarette onto the table. “Here,” I offered, pouring a cup of tea from the pot. I rested my hand on the painted grapefruit and lavender design to hold it steady. “Drink this.”\n\nShe took it obediently, blew on it, then took a sip and winced. “Too hot?” I asked sharply.\n\n“Too bitter,” she responded coolly.\n\n“Too bad,” I finished. “Drink the whole cup if you want to see what’s on the other side.”\n\nShe sipped as I spoke. “You’ve told me that Raymond’s been gone a month. You’re brokenhearted, but you can’t move on if he’s still here. The shock was terrible, wasn’t it? A hit-and-run while he was crossing the street right in front of your own home. The worst moments of your life were sprinting through the house, knowing what was outside before you saw it. The hope was the worst, because you *knew* that your husband’s broken body would be lying in the street. But the smallest part of you hoped that it wasn’t true, and that *hope* made it hurt so much more. You found him in a gory heap just beyond your front yard, and the future you’d imagined drained away like blood through your fingers. And it was in that exact moment, kneeling in the middle of the street at 7:13 p. m., that you realized your life had been permanently changed to a different path of someone else’s choosing.” I took an aggressive puff of the cigarette and pressed forward. “The sun set while you held his already-cooling hand, and you realized that this would be the first sunset you’d spend knowing he was dead, and that you would end every day with this thought on your mind from now on.”\n\nShe blanched. “I never told you that it was at sunset. I never even said it was a car accident.”\n\nI narrowed my eyes at her. “The guilt was more than you expected, because part of you had actually cared about Raymond. Yes, he was old, and *boring,* my God, you would never let him forget it. But he’d felt just so fucking fragile when you crushed his spine with the car that the anger didn’t seem to make sense in the moment.” I blew smoke through my nostrils. “He knew it was you, Cindy. You pulled the car into the driveway and rinsed off the blood so fast that no one even thought to check it for evidence. But *he* knew, and as he lay dying, unable to speak through shattered lungs, he stared at you without hate, malice, or vengeance. It was simple confusion, Cindy. Raymond never considered that you did it for the cash. His dying thought was wondering how he’d somehow been a bad husband, and he felt guilty for not knowing why.”\n\nHer eyes were shimmering with tears that I believed were genuine, but I didn’t give a shit.\n\nHer cup of tea was empty. \n\n“I was so careful,” she whispered in a pitch that was just below the ‘only dogs can hear it’ threshold. \n\nI rolled my eyes. “No you weren’t, Sweetie. People are just stupid, and that’s the only reason you’ve gotten away with everything so far. Really, putting $619,138 cash in a briefcase is just *asking* for trouble.”\n\nHer jaw hung in shock. “How could you possibly have known?”\n\nI blew one last long stream of smoke from the cigarette. “If I were in your shoes, Sweetie, I’d be much more worried about how much poisonous oleander you just had with your tea.”\n\nShe slammed her hands on the table and grabbed the edges so hard that the empty cup rattled in its saucer. *“What did you do to me?”* \n\nI pulled the cigarette butt from my lips and quashed it in her empty cup. “Make peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,” I answered flatly. Then I turned to look across the sun porch at the ghost only I could see.\n\nRaymond was a disgusting mess. His shattered spine had no hope of holding his torso rigid, so every limp limb flopped at unholy angles. A fountain of black blood oozed from his white lips and nose. His intestines protruded from his stomach like ground beef squeezed between grimy fingers, and the coils hung to the ground like sausage links.\n\nHe stared at his young widow. \n\nOr, I should say, the one eye that hadn’t popped to jelly was staring.\n\nI really think that Cindy would have been unnerved if she’d known he was there. \n\nInstead, she focused on me. “How long… when will it start?” She asked in utter petrification. \n\n“In just a second, Sweetie,” I quipped casually, lighting up another cigarette.\n\nRaymond grunted. He wasn’t much for talking, what with the lolling tongue dangling impotently where his missing jaw should have been.\n\n“Oh, and one last thing, Sugar.” I leaned forward and gently rested my palms on the tabletop. “Raymond wants to let you know that dying really, *really* fucking hurts.” \n\nShe froze. Behind her, despite lacking a mouth, I could swear that Raymond was smiling.\n\nThe convulsing started then, but it didn’t stop for a long time. \n\nDo you have any idea how far mouth foam can spray when a dying woman just won’t stop thrashing?\n\nI almost felt bad for her when I realized how hard she was trying to cry. \n\nThat’s a really fucking difficult task, though, when your throat is closing up. \n\nThat’s when Raymond sauntered over to her jittering body, knelt down, and gently grazed his dead fingertips across her cheek. He looked passionately into her eyes, and for just a moment, I think she looked back.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nThe ghost-corpse took in the sight for a few moments before I interrupted him with a forced clearing of my throat.\n\n“A-*hem.*” He glanced up at me with his lone functioning eye. It was damp. “I *do* appreciate your clear instructions on how to locate the briefcase. If everything is as promised, the bill will be settled.”\n\nHe grunted and waved his limp, floppy arm at the body of his dead wife. \n\n“Her? I’ll leave her in the backyard of your house. I snuck an oleander plant into the garden during one of my nightly visits. They’re not uncommon here in Alabama, and they will explain her ‘accidental’ death nicely.” I wrinkled my nose. “And I have to say, I’ll be grateful to stop sneaking into your house each night to spook this murderous little witch. Her masturbatory moans made me gag, and I hate crawling through windows. I’m not fifty anymore, you know.” I took in a deep breath of nicotine-laced air.\n\nHe grunted again, dangling his unresponsive arm above the dead woman once more. \n\n“Hmmm?” I asked in genuine curiosity as I approached the corpse. “There’s something more?”\n\nHe shook more eagerly, spraying a fine mist of ghost blood onto the woman’s purple face. \n\n“Oh, my,” I whispered.\n\nI bent down and pried a ring from the woman’s rubbery hand. \n\n“There must be two dozen diamonds on this!” I sang. Then I slipped it onto my middle finger.\n\nIt fit perfectly. \n\n“Yes, thank you very much, I *do* accept tips for a job well done, you gentleman, you.”\n\nThis time I *know* Raymond was smiling.\n\nAnd I was, too.\n\nMy name is Patricia Barnes, and I’m a hitman for ghosts that [only I can see](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462\/).\n\n[BD](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ByfelsDisciple\/)\n\n-----\n\n[What happened next](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/b59hoa\/im_patricia_barnes_hitman_for_ghosts_that_only_i\/?)"},"245":{"title":"I found a disturbing yoga stream.

Tucked between the kickboxing classes and the home-gym meatheads was her thumbnail.\n\nIt caught my eye. It was a simple shot of her face, so near to the camera that I could count the freckles. Her teeth a little too large for her mouth and her nose ever so slightly crooked.\n\nI’ve never been the type of guy to consider yoga, but I tuned in, and in a matter of seconds, I was entranced.\n\nThe girl was in her living room, a haphazard mise-en-scene – the floor speckled with sad little plants and stacks of magazines. She posed with her hands on the floor and her hips thrust in the air. Her butt perched in the center of the screen.\n\nI decided to stay a while.\n\nI had no yoga mat, so I laid out a towel. It was difficult to follow along – she talked, a *lot*, and only a fraction of it was about the routine. “Press your heels together and bend your head to your feet, breathing deeply. My feet smell like peaches and cream today. Makes me want to gobble them up. I love summer peaches, I love biting into them and feeling the juice erupt in my mouth, it reminds me of the time when – ”\n\nAnd I fell into the meditative quagmire woven by her words, inhaling the scent of my own socks, failing to notice she’d moved into a different pose.\n\nAfter a while, my muscles trembled with the effort of supporting my soft body in these unfamiliar positions, so I called it a day. It was then that I noticed it.\n\n*Subscribers: 1*\n\nThat was me. I was the only one watching. I felt an inexplicable flood of guilt when I closed the browser, like I was abandoning her.\n\nI checked back into her channel the next few afternoons. It was the strangest thing. She was *always* streaming. She was either unaware of my presence, or apathetic to it. Her ramblings, so freewheeling that they approached random word association, didn’t seem to change whether I was there or not – she was often mid-sentence when I logged in. She was flirty in a way that made it clear she wasn’t trying to be, charmingly raw in her tendency to fumble instructions.\n\nCuriosity overwhelmed me. I yearned to discover more about this fascinating creature. Her movements drew me in, like she was grasping at me through the screen. I marveled at the feeling of being her silent voyeur.\n\nI developed more comfort with the basic poses, though I still couldn’t get my hands anywhere near my toes. Too soon, she notched up the level of difficulty. She eased herself into the splits. Each leg outstretched, her toes pointed at perfect right angles. I tried my best to replicate the pose, my groin protesting the pressure. Each day, she pushed a little farther. She curved her spine sharply behind her, a graceful arc. She lifted her back leg high into the air at an angle that seemed to wrench her hip out of place.\n\nI forced my body into the closest approximations of her geometry that my tendons would allow, my teeth gritted against the sharp warnings issued by my nerves. At night I dreamed that she was breaking my joints, cracking my limbs into the clean shapes that she maintained so effortlessly.\n\nOne day she twisted her arms so far behind her that I felt sympathetic pain, and folded herself up so that her bent legs swooped around her shoulders, touching her toes behind her neck. She smiled at the camera, demurely, politely. “You want to see me bend into a pretzel, don’t you?” she asked.\n\nThat was the first time she addressed me.\n\nI would forget to eat. I’d wake up on the couch, having dozed off, and she would be murmuring about pomegranates while her forehead brushed her knees. Did she sleep? Did she eat? I saw no evidence of it.\n\nEvery time I moved, my body ached with the memory of being stretched to its limit. I was spending ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day on her stream. She spoke to me frequently. “I know you’ve been watching me. I think you like watching me. How far do you want me to twist for you?”\n\nThe fluid shifting of her body into vertices and curves and delicate polygons was hypnotizing. I was getting lost in the light of a flickering flame as it swirled into different patterns. I was working myself into something more pliable, molding myself into something like her image.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the moment she went too far. It was more like the creep of quicksand than any one single point.\n\nShe would lie on her back and lift herself on the palms and soles of her feet, her torso thrusting at the ceiling like she was something from the Exorcist. She would inch her hands and feet closer together, folding her body backwards on itself until she was nearly split in half. And then she would skitter forward until the whites of her eyes flooded the screen, scaring me so much that I jumped. And she would laugh, as if she had made a joke.\n\nShe would twist her head around like an owl, and thrust it between her thighs. Always blinking at the screen. Always smiling like we were sharing some inside secret, like I was in on the sly conspiracy.\n\nShe said, “You like this, don’t you, Mr. Smith? Am I your foldable pocket toy?”\n\nSmith is a very common last name. There was a nonzero chance she’d just guessed correctly. But this freaked me out enough to slam the laptop shut, shattering the image of her toothy smile.\n\nI tried to resume normal life. But I had almost nothing to fill my time except television and social media and filling out applications for jobs I’d never want to work. A strange sensation tickled at me, like something was wrong, like I was forgetting something. And powerful waves of guilt, the same guilt I’d felt when I closed her stream the first day I’d found her.\n\nI tried not to. I really, really tried to stay away. But the urge overwhelmed me, so I returned.\n\nFor the first time, she wasn’t onscreen when I logged in. I peered closer at the scene, seeing the familiar yoga mat on the ground, the coffee table, the magazines. There was a soft noise coming from just off-screen, a muffled noise, irregular and halting. A human voice. I turned the volume all the way up, and I couldn’t tell if it was laughter or crying.\n\nFeeling sick, I closed the stream.\n\nThis brings us to yesterday.\n\nI had spent countless hours thinking about her, wondering what she was doing, whether she was still telling stories to her invisible visitor. I logged in.\n\nHer eyes filled the webcam’s field of vision, so suddenly that I scrambled backwards. And that sound – echoing around the walls of her apartment and mine, and it was now clear that it was a sound of misery.\n\nHer moan was wordless, and as her face backed away, I saw why. Her bare foot was stuffed halfway in her mouth, her jaw nearly unhinged to accommodate it, the ball wedged between her teeth. Tears were streaming down her face, pooling around the corners of her stretched lips.\n\nHer arms were folded behind her head and her other leg was tucked under the first. She was struggling, and I realized that she was stuck.\n\nShe was trapped in that position, a twisted ball of limbs and strained joints, unable to speak.\n\nI stared slackjawed at the screen, and her eyes met mine, seeming to blink in recognition. The force of her sobs crescendoed. In relief? I wasn’t sure.\n\nI had no idea what to do. I didn’t know her name or where she lived – I didn’t even know for sure that she was in the same country. I sat, frozen, for long moments, watching the twitching of her limbs as she tried to wrench herself out of the cage her body made. Then it struck me: I could type.\n\n*Can you type your address?*\n\nThe messaged pinged its arrival at her computer. Our first real communication.\n\nShe shook her head almost imperceptibly, with the slight range of motion her position allowed.\n\nI tried again: *Can you type with your nose?*\n\nHer eyes flickered across the page as she read my words. With great effort she rocked herself over, landing face-first on the keyboard. *sivioshgeusoh*, she typed.\n\nMy heart pounding, I said, *try again*.\n\nI watched as she managed to prop herself precariously on one shoulder. Her body was convulsing with the force of her sobs. Eventually, she leaned forward, carefully, delicately, and pressed the tip of her nose to the keys. *3*.\n\nYes! That was it! *That’s great. Give me another number.*\n\nWe traded for long, suspenseful minutes, her giving me one number or letter at a time, me writing them down and encouraging her as best I could. *You’re doing great. I’m here with you. Help is on the way.*\n\nShe had cobbled together a number and a street. It had taken us nearly an hour to get to this point. She had just finished typing *apt12* when she stopped, trembling with the effort of keeping herself upright, and we met eyes again through the camera, hers shining with pain and fear. And then she collapsed.\n\nShe rolled out of sight. Panicking, I sent her dozens of frantic messages: *What city? What state? Stay with me. I’m here. Where are you? I need more.*\n\nIt became clear that no more was coming. Her sobs stilled, her breath quieted.\n\nI searched the address and found every city in the country where the address she’d given me existed. I called every police station in every jurisdiction within range. It took a *lot* of explanation, but after hours of work there was nothing I could do but sit and wait nervously by the phone and stare at the empty apartment framed within my laptop screen.\n\nAll I could do was type.\n\n*I’m here with you.*\n\n*You’ll be safe.*\n\n*This will be over soon.*\n\n*You’re not alone.*\n\nThe ringing of the phone nearly sent me out of my skin. It was one in the morning.\n\n“Did you find her?” I asked desperately, scanning the scene for any sign of activity. “Tell me she’s all right!”\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line sighed, a deep sigh, of sadness or frustration I couldn’t say. “We found her,” he said, his words gentle but guarded. “Stuck in that position, as you described. She’s… she’s not okay. She died of dehydration.”\n\n“She – what? No. That’s not possible. I just spoke to her!”\n\n“I don’t know what you saw, son. I truly don’t. But the girl we found has been dead for a month.”\n\n[*x*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relicularity\/)"},"246":{"title":"Because You Are My Baby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ai41d3\/because_you_are_my_baby\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My mother had the most beautiful teeth.\n\nHer teeth are my first memory. I remember them: long and white and bared in a ferocious grin, shining under the full moon as she told me a story. Not a fairy tale or picture book, but *my* the story. The story of how I’d come to her…or rather, how she’d come to me. \n\nWhen I was very small – too small to remember anything at all – my mother stole me from a man, and took me to live in the forest.  She stole me not as an act of love, but as an act of revenge. Though I was desperate to know, she never told me what needed revenging.\n\nOne night, I finally asked, “Why won’t you tell me?”\n\n“Because you are my baby,” she whispered in her low, wet voice. She stroked my face with long fingers. Her teeth glittered under the stars, rich and pale as polished ivory. “My baby will never hear, or see, or know the cruelties that haunt me.” \n\nCruelty was not the only thing my mother knew that I did not, although it *was* the only thing she refused to teach me. My mother tried very hard to teach me everything else she knew. Unfortunately, I was a very poor pupil indeed.\n\nMy mother was a remarkable huntress. She felled elk and bear effortlessly. Sometimes she slid into the lake without so much as a ripple, and returned hours later with a monstrous fish clamped in her jaws.\n\nBecause hunting came so easily to her, Mother expected me to learn quickly. “Men hunt,” she hissed. “They have always hunted. So shall you.”\n\nBut I could not hunt. Not like her. My small, soft fingers were no match for her lethal claws. My clumsy little body – somehow so susceptible to both the heat and the cold – trailed after her whiplike predator’s form. Mother caught deer and foxes with her beautiful teeth, striking from the shadows like a snake. By contrast, my dull teeth could not even crush rabbit bones.\n\nI persevered, but did not improve. One night, while Mother snaked through the shadows, communing with trees and evading the dark things prowling the night, I curled up and wept. \n\nShe found me that way, weak and weeping. I covered my eyes and held my breath. I knew it was useless – Mother could hear my heartbeat from the other side of the hill, so she surely knew I was crying – but that small scrap of pride was all I had.\n\nMother stood there for a long while. Then she crept forward and covered me with fresh leaves before lying beside me. “I will feed you, always,” she whispered. “Because you are my baby.”\n\nIn addition to hunting, my mother was a phenomenal creator of shelters. Sometimes she lived within the earth, snaking through loam and tree roots like treasure-hoarding dragons of old.\n\nSometimes she lived in the trees. Many nights I watched in awe as her bones elongated and tore through her rough skin, stretching upward to twist among the branches like an ancient spider god. I would wait patiently, sometimes for hours, as Mother communed with the spirits buried in the roots.\n\nAnd sometimes she lived in the shadows, creeping through the darkness to flush out food and threat alike. \n\nSo, Mother tried to teach me to dig burrows. But I could not dig like her. I was too small and too soft, and far too frightened of the bugs and moles that tunneled through the earth.\n\nSo she tried to teach me to live among the tree branches, to rest and listen as the redwoods murmured the long, strange histories of the earth. But my bones could not stretch like Mother’s. I could not twist my arms to match the branches. My skin could not interlock with the treebark, and my blood was too sluggish to melt into the sap.\n\nSo Mother tried to teach me to live in the shadows. But the darkness terrified me. Every night, I hid and wept, imagining the legs of centipedes crawling across my skin. All the night creatures reveled in my fear; owls swooped down to taunt me and bats torpedoed toward me, giggling in their shrill, squeaking voices until mother slapped them out of the sky.\n\nFinally Mother realized the futility of these lessons. So she dug a deep burrow just for me. She lined it with leaves and slurped the worms and roaches from the walls. When she finished, I burst into tears.\n\n“Why do you weep?” she rasped.\n\n“Because you do everything for me.” I knew the laws of nature. I knew the laws of forest creatures and their young. Young that were weak were killed in the nest. Young that could not learn to fend for themselves were abandoned to die. I was weak and soft and coated in terrible, ugly scars. “Why do you do everything for me?”\n\nMother snaked forward, long, large hands sinking into the earth. She curled around me and pulled me close. “Because you are my baby.”\n\nMother did not always live in the burrow with me. She roamed the mountains. She burrowed with moles, slithered with snakes, grazed with elk, hunted with wolves, stood with trees. \n\nWhen I was very small, I thought she ate the forest. But it was not that simple; she protected it, and in return it sustained her. “My heart,” she told me one rainy night, “is the forest, so this is how it must be.”\n\nAs I grew older, I developed rudimentary survival skills. I shied away from hunting big game – elk and deer, bears and boar – because I did not protect the forest. I gave it nothing; I only took, so I took as little as I could. I trapped rabbits, fished the streams, and ate wild berries. I dared take nothing else.\n\nOnce I could reliably feed myself, Mother stayed away for long stretches. Hours, then days, and finally weeks. I missed her terribly, with a deep, panicky ache.\n\nI confronted her about it one balmy spring evening. “You leave me more and more,” I accused. “Soon you’ll leave me forever.”\n\n“Never,” she murmured. A breeze twined around us, raising gooseflesh on my skin and rippling her long white hair. “I will never leave you.”\n\n“But you do!” I screamed. “You already do!”\n\n“Before you came, I lived among the trees, listening to their warnings. I slept in the warm earth as worms and centipedes nibbled my skin. I spent many of your lifetimes within the forest, little one – so many lives at a time that I forgot my own name. I do not leave you. I have left the forest for you.”\n\n“I didn’t come here,” I sobbed. “You took me!”\n\n“I did,” she said. “So I will never leave you. When you think I’ve left, silence yourself and listen. Listen for me the way I listen for the trees, the animals, and the stars. If you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”\n\nAnd then she left.\n\nFury and jealousy seared my heart like a wildfire. She insulted me, she humiliated me, and after all that she *left* me. Left me for the centipedes and the wolves and the stupid, chittering bats.\n\n“I don’t need you!” I screamed. An owl hooted angrily in response. “I don’t need you at all!”\n\nThen I ran for my burrow. As it the earthen door materialized before me, nodding with flowers and wild grasses, anger swelled inside me. It possessed me, this wild ball of misery borne of my own endless fear and inadequacy. And it spoke to me.\n*Why should you return to the burrow?* it asked. Why indeed? It wasn’t mine. It was Mother’s. The entire forest belonged to Mother. Without her, the forest would have consumed me long ago.\n\nSo I turned away from the burrow and kept running. *I will find the end of the forest,* I decided. *I will leave it once and for all.*\n\nI ran for days, in the process treating the forest with contempt. I stripped the trees of their leaves to make nightly beds. I threw rocks at birds and rabbits. I uprooted bushes and stripped entire groves of their berries, eating until I threw up from sheer excess. Then I ate again. Not out of hunger, not out of any need, but out of malice.\n\nAnd one day – long after spring ceded to summer in a verdant explosion of heat and greenery – I heard voices.\n\nI froze immediately. The only voice I knew was Mother’s – wet and low, an earthy, rib-shaking whisper. These voices were nothing like Mother’s. They were high and somehow infantile, with strange, shrill notes.\n\nThese voices…they were like *mine.*\n\nTrembling, I dropped low and crept through the underbrush. Sun-warmed leaves brushed against my face, smooth but painfully crisp; the sun was taking its toll on them. I snaked over the ground, pretending I was Mother, slipping through the forest like an invisible snake.\n\nI reached a break in the trees and peered through.\n\nIn a small clearing were four creatures. They had pink skin and wore heavy clothing that looked suffocating. There hands were small and soft. Their faces were smooth and babylike, somehow half-formed: wide eyed and rounded, with soft noses and plump flesh.\n\nI touched my face – flat and smooth - and looked down at myself: mudstreaked, deeply tanned, and marked with a hideous mass of scars, but still *soft.* Hairless, small, weak. There was no mistaking it. These things in the woods – these overdressed, half-formed beings with small teeth and no claws and overlarge eyes – were like me.\n\nThey were men.\n\nI stood up, propelled by panicky excitement, and strode forward. All at once, they froze.\n\n“What the hell?” one whispered. He lifted something in his arms and pointed it at me. It was long and strange to me. Inorganic, not alive, with a wooden handle and a gleaming tube.\n\nJust then, I realized something: the forest was silent. A few birds chirped and sang, and a few bugs emitted their persistent drone. But the vast majority – birds, insects, trees – were silent. No rabbits, no deer, certainly no bears. These things – these creatures like me, these *men* - had silenced the earth.\n\nThey’d stolen the forest from itself. \n\nWe stared at each other for a long time as ever-growing summer heat filled the clearing like an invisible pool.\n\n“Mother,” I whispered. “Mother, please help me.”\n\nShe did not. So I turned and ran.\n\nThe men immediately pursued. I could hear them: yelling, crushing the undergrowth, stamping on blossoms and bugs, snapping branches as they ran. The forest’s deathly silence was worse than any cry.\n\n“There it is!” one of them screamed. A second later, the forest exploded: a deafening *boom* shook the trees and ate through the air as pain erupted on my shoulder. I didn’t dare stop or look. I pressed on, running and crying as the men came after me.\n\nThe forest seemed to punish me for my earlier cruelty. Brambles scratched my legs. Stones cut my feet. Branches swiped at my face, leaving deep, stinging runnels. I thanked the forest for its kindness. I thanked it for punishing me, rather than stopping me. \n\nThe men gasped and wailed amongst themselves. “What the hell is it?” “I don’t know. *I don’t know!*” “Is it a…a kid?” “Look at its face. Look at its fucking face! That isn’t a kid!”\n\nSomething suddenly filled my ears, drowning the sounds of the men and the forest. A deep, musical rushing, like birdsong transformed into a turbulent river.\n\nAnd then Mother came, erupting from the trees like a great beast of old. But that’s what she was, after all. A great beast, surely a daemon of the ancient world.\n\nShe pounced upon the men, batting them the way a housecat bats its toys. She clamped one between her claws, squeezing until his head separated and went rolling across the ground.\n\nOne by one Mother caught and tore them, shredding them the way she shredded leaves for my bedding. Blood streaked the forest, turning the dirt to mud and dripping from the trees like sluggish rain. \n\nMother dug her claws into the skull of the last survivor and cracked it open like a fruit. Blood and grey brain glistened in the sunlight. The man screamed, and screamed, and screamed.\n\nMother leaned down and extended her tongue. It curled outward, pale and orange-gold like sunrise on a cold, clear morning, and delicately slurped his brains. Curl by curl, like so many worms from my burrow walls.\n\nBy the time he stopped screaming, the forest had returned to its loud, familiar glory: murmuring trees, singing birds, skittering insects, grazing deer. \n\nI smiled and ran to Mother. She reared up and screamed, “*See what you’ve done!*”\n\nTerror paralyzed me. I looked helplessly at her – blazing eyes, contorted face runneled with earth and wildflowers, sunbleached bone and pale, spongy rot. My mother, my beautiful daemon mother who claimed me out of revenge and raised me out of obligation, staring at me like I was a man.\n\n“When you stone a bird, my heart stops! When you break a branch, my bones snap! When you selfishly strip the shrubs of their fruit, of their very birthright, my skin blisters! When you hurt the forest,” she roared, “*my heart bleeds!*”\n\nI fell to my knees and hid my face. Mother rushed forward on her many limbs and wrapped long fingers around my throat. She lifted me up, dangling me over the forest floor. “I killed men for you! Now more will come! They will trample! They will cut! They will burn! They will kill! They will kill the bears and the cougars and the wolves, for they will blame the predators for what I have done for you! Do you see?” She shook me. The carnage below seemed to swing beneath me, a tapestry of blood-soaked earth and ruined corpses. “*Do you see?*”\n\n“Yes, Mother,” I whispered. “I see.”\n\nShe dropped me. I hit the ground with such force it knocked the wind out of me. Mother pulled back and busied herself with one of the corpses. I looked up, shaking. Birds watched from the trees, quick and curious and full of condemnation. I averted my eyes as tears spilled.\n\nMother returned to me. She extended an arm and opened her hand. Upon her large palm were four eyes and a large, glistening heart. I stared at them blankly, then looked up at her.\n\n“Four eyes,” she said. “One from each man. And the heart of the one that shot you. Eat.”\n\nMy lip quivered. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the gore in my mother’s hand. A heart and eyes. Raw and plump, alive just minutes ago.\n\n“Mother,” I said. “Please.”\n\n“Are you of me?” she asked. “Or are you of man?”\n\nThe forest became painfully silent. The animals, the trees, and the insects, all waiting with bated breath.\n\n“I am of you, Mother.” I plucked the first eye from her palm. It was round and curiously firm, with a sort of firm, watery texture I associated with half-rotten fruits. The pink, wormy optic nerve dangled. For a terrible moment I thought I would vomit.\n\nThen I raised it to my lips and bit in.\n\nThe eyes were awful, the heart even worse: thick and almost impossible to chew. Mother had to tear it for me, slicing it into manageable pieces with her beautiful teeth. \n\nWhen I finished, Mother picked me up and, holding me tightly, streaked back to the burrow as night fell.\n\nThat night, I became ill. I shook and shivered and hallucinated for days. My mind bled with images of dangling eyes and glistening hearts and skulls cracked apart like pomegranates. Mother lay with my all the while, soothing me with ancient songs like birdsong turned to rivers, and cooling me with her damp, earthy breath.\n\nFinally the fever broke. I sat up, gasping as the last vestiges of my nightmare drifted away.\n\nMother sat across the burrow, hunched over tiredly. “You are well,” she said. “I am glad, for I must leave.”\n\nI blinked tiredly. “Why?”\n\n“Men,” she said. \n\n“But you killed them.”\n\n“There are more,” she said. “They creep into the forest, searching for their dead brethren. They are cutting the trees and crushing the flowers and killing the bears, my little one. If I don’t stop them, they will even come for you. I have to stop them. My heart is the forest, and so are you. I must protect both.”\n\nA lump rose in my throat. Shame like I’d never known enveloped me. “I’m so sorry.”\n\n“You are my baby. Babies must learn. By learning, they grow.”\n\n“Mother,” I said. “Am I truly of man?”\n\nMother closed her eyes. For a long time, she did not speak. Then she drew a deep breath. “I took you from a cruel man. Listen. I will tell you now of the cruelties I endured.”\n\nI listened, enraptured and horrified, as she spun her sorry tale.\n\nMother was once a young, beautiful human woman.\n\n“Surely not more beautiful than you are now,” I objected.\n\n“Listen!” she said.\n\nMother was alone in the world. She had no family or friends. She once had a family, but they harmed her greatly so she ran away. She lived in the forest, in a small, ragged tent. She ate wild berries, fished the lake, and boiled water to drink.\n\nLaws are strange things. Though Mother hurt nothing and no one, she was breaking the law by living in the forest. She was found, and caught, and imprisoned. Separated from the trees and the birds, Mother faded quickly. Though she was only jailed for a short while, it nearly killed her. The day she was released was the best day of her life…\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nNo sooner had Mother gathered her meager belongings and exited the jail than a guard came up beside her. “Where are you headed to?” he asked. “I’ll take you wherever you want to go.”\n\nMother was ecstatic. “Take me back to the forest,” she said. The guard obliged, driving her toward the woods. Except he stopped too soon. He stopped at a house. His house, it turned out.\n\nThe guard was a terrible man. He trapped Mother. He hurt her, tortured her, abused her in every way. He cut her open, he burned her, he snapped her bones. \n\nAnd he put a baby in her. Mother was so broken that he missed all signs of impending childbirth. When I came, Mother died.\n\n“He dumped me in a vat of acid,” Mother told me, “and scattered my liquid remains among the trees. But then I heard you.” Mother smiled faintly. Crumbles of dirt and root fell from her face. “I heard your cry. Your need for me.”\n\nI do not understand what Mother said next; it is difficult to translate. But the closest I can come is this. Everyone sings a song to those they love. Most aren’t able to hear these songs. If you can’t hear, it can’t help you. But if you can hear it, a song is the most powerful thing in the world. It kills. It calls. It consumes. It destroys. It strengthens.\n\nAnd sometimes, it resurrects.\n\n“When I reformed and breathed again, I stole you from your father,” Mother said. “Then I brought you here, because you are my baby.”\n\nI wept silently, because I didn’t know what to say.\n\n“I must go,” she said. “The trees and the animals need me now. So remember, little one. When you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”\n\nThen she whipped around – like a wolf, a snake, and hawk combined – and left.\n\nShe did not return.\n\nAt first, I thought nothing of it. I had made a terrible mess; I had summoned men. I had caused the forest to bleed. Mother had a great deal of work ahead of her.\n\nBut summer slowly bled into fall, and still Mother did not return. When the first snow came – dry and cold, skittering across the landscape like powder – I knew something was wrong.\n\nThe snows deepened. The forest drifted into its winter sleep, cloaked in ice and fog. Every night, I made myself silent. I mustered all the sincerity I could. And I listened for my mother’s voice.\n\nIt didn’t come.\n\nI grew thin and sick. My skin burned even as I shivered. My chest grew congested, my throat so sore I couldn’t sleep. My breath came in sharp, pained wheezes.  Soon I became too weak to leave the burrow. I crawled to the doorway and ate snow. For sustenance, I slurped worms from the earthen walls. \n\nIt was not enough, and I knew it.\n\nOnly then – in the quiet and peace and fear of approaching death – did I become truly silent. Only then did I hear the voice of my mother.\n\nI heard her in my dreams: the low, rushing voice like music made into water. *I am coming,* she said. *I am coming, because you are my baby.*\n\nI smiled, and slept. \n\nNext thing I knew, I was cold. Cold and wet and shivering, but *awake.*I shot up and screamed as my skin brushed the thick, flower-matted hide of my mother. I spun around, smiling, and froze.\n\nMother lay beside me, panting. Blood seeped from a hundred wounds, crusting her hair. The exposed bones in her face were crushed and concave, leaking gore and blood. Without opening her eyes, she smiled. “I heard you. I heard your song.”\n\nTears blurred my vision. My chest began to hitch. I couldn’t draw breath; it was like I was sick again, drowning in pus and trapped fluid. Only I wasn’t dying this time.\n\nMy mother was.\n\n“Then stay,” I said. “You have to stay, because you can hear my song.”\n\n“No,” she said. “You needed to see me again. But you do not need me.”\n\n“I need you. Mama, *I need you.*”\n\n“No,” she said. “I killed all who would harm you.”\n\n“But what about the forest? The forest will kill me without you!”\n\nShe chuckled. Her breath came, terribly fast and increasingly weak. “You are of me. Remember. You are of me. You are my baby.”\n\nMy mother – my beautiful, ancient mother – drew a shallow breath, and lay still.\n\nI lay beside her for many days. Then, when she began to stink, I left. A hiker eventually found me. A stupid, solitary hiker with a soft heart, a great deal of patience, and no fear.\n\nWhen I learned to speak the words of men, the authorities lost no time in telling me that Mother was not really my mother. \n\nThey discovered my identity (at least in a manner of speaking) through DNA. My real mother, they say, was a vagrant. A Jane Doe who lived in a tent in the national park. She was alone and defenseless, two things that attract human monsters. After a brief stint in jail for loitering, my mother ended up kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured by an as-yet unidentified assailant who eventually tried unsuccessfully to dissolve her in acid. They think he attempted to dissolve my body, too. That’s why I am covered in scars. It is why I frightened those hunters so long ago: the acid burns make me look like a monster to men.\n\nSince my real mother apparently died long ago, they decided that Mother – whoever she was – was nothing but a crazy, homeless child abuser.\n\nBut I know better.\n\nEven so, I adapted. I had no choice. I am of my mother, but I live among men. That’s what animals must do; their young learn, grow, and adapt. If they don’t, they die. \n\nBut I am not adapting anymore. At least, I am not adapting to live among men. My mouth is changing. Changing in ways that are terrible to people, but wonderful to me. It’s my teeth, you see.\n\nI am growing my mother’s beautiful teeth.\n\nLooking at my teeth in the mirror was frightening and electrifying. Joy and terror ran through my veins in equal measure. It had to mean something. So I fell silent. I became sincere. I listened.\n\nAnd I heard.\n\nI heard the voice of my mother: low and rushing, like birdsong turned to a wild river. She tells me I do not belong with men, because I am her heart, and her heart is the forest. She tells me I must return.\n\nAnd she tells me she is waiting for me, because I am her baby.\n"},"247":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room. Final Part.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bue2kk\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":null,"author":"Verastahl","selftext":"[Part One](https:\/\/redd.it\/brco33)\n**** \n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)\n**** \n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)\n**** \n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)\n**** \n\n\nI spent the next five days watching Rachel die.\n\nFrom the outside, just watching the monitor, it didn’t seem that different than what I had been watching for the past three years.  Rachel slept, she watched T.V., she read, and she painted.  But there were signs if you were looking for them.  She seemed tired and tense, and she had taken to sleeping more.  And occasionally, just every once in a while, she would glance up at the camera—at me.  It was then that I could see the fear and sadness in her eyes.\n\nInside…well, inside I felt like a burned out house collapsing in on itself.  At first I refused to watch, to do anything they wanted me to do.  Solomon didn’t get mad at me, but just shrugged.  He said while cooperation was preferred and could go a long way toward making my stay with them more comfortable, it wasn’t required.  \n\nIf he was right, Solomon said with a thin smile, things would play out as they were meant to, regardless of what I wanted or thought I chose.  Either way, he added, the video was about to start back playing and would not stop for another five days.  Whether I wanted to spend that time getting to see her again was entirely up to me.\n\nI tried to not watch, but a part of me knew from the start I was going to.  Maybe I would find some clue that they were lying about her being dead.  Or Rachel could give me some advice or warning about what I needed to do next.  I didn’t know.  What I did know is that I couldn’t miss the chance to see her again.  And despite knowing in my heart that she was dead and everything on the video had happened a long time ago, I still felt that by watching I was with her somehow.  \n\nShe had been taken away from everything she knew when she was barely grown, trapped for years just for being special.  Experimented on.  Treated like property.  Kept from ever having friends or family or a life.  And yet through all that, she was still beautiful.  Not just on the outside, but on the inside too.  I had spent years watching her, getting to know her in a thousand tiny ways that so few people ever truly know each other.  I had seen her kindness and grace in her actions, even when she was fighting against the people holding her.  I had watched her strength when she woke up day after day in her prison and never gave up.  And I saw the beauty of her soul in her paintings, full of swirling colors and…what was the word…wonder.  She was able to paint these things she saw with such care and love, despite living in a world that had abandoned her so completely.\n\nWell I wasn’t abandoning her.  I would watch every bit of the video I could manage.  Try to burn into my memory every frame of her I saw.  Not for them and their stupid project.  But for me.  And for her.  I may not have much left to do in my life before they lock me away somewhere or kill me, but I could do this one last thing.\n\nRachel wouldn’t die alone.\n\n****\n\nI watched nearly all of it, stopping only to eat quickly and use the bathroom until the last two days.  I would ask the guards to pause it, but they would only shake their heads and say Solomon said it had to play normally until it was finished.  By the fourth day, I was in a stupor.  I had already dozed some the first three days, but when I woke up on the fourth day, I could tell a few hours had passed.  There were two trays of food on the bed, one breakfast and another lunch.  I looked back at the screen in a panic, worrying I had missed something, but Rachel seemed to be just waking up too.  I noticed her putting her hand to her stomach as she got out of bed and felt my own stomach twist.  She was already hurting.  Rachel glanced at the camera and tried to smile before moving to set up a new canvas for painting.  \n\nThis was the second of three paintings she did in those last days.  The first had been the inside of an old-fashioned movie theater from the viewpoint of someone sitting in a back row.  On the movie screen was just the image of a sledgehammer propped against a brick wall.  I didn’t understand what it meant, and I found myself scanning the picture for some message or other clue.  Eventually I found what might be one, though I didn’t understand it either.\n\nRachel must have come to understand they knew what she was doing with the paintings and didn’t want to stop her, because these last three she set up much closer to the camera.  I was still squinting and studying the painting closely when I realized the flipped up seats in the next row up had brass number plates along the front edge of the seats.  Though they were upside down from the viewpoint of the painting, the angle was good enough that once I noticed them I was able to read them.  \n\n**2…43…26…89**\n\nI didn’t understand any of it, but I committed it all to memory, focusing all my attention on the painting until she finally took it away.  Even that early on I could tell painting was taking a lot out of her now, and like I had for so long, I found myself talking to her, telling her to go rest before I remembered her body in the next room.  I almost stopped then, but no.  Maybe she couldn’t tell I was talking to her, or maybe she could.  Either way, me talking to her couldn’t hurt, and it made me feel a little less lonely and sad as I watched her.\n\nThe second painting, the one she started after I woke up from falling asleep for a few hours, was stranger than the rest.  It looked like it was in a room with curved walls made of tree roots, and in the center of the room was a little table made out of the same stuff.  Some of the roots around the room were a deep red, but other parts, including the table thing, looked burned and black.  I looked closer and saw that I could see a person’s shadow over the table—hands holding some long oval-shaped bundle.\n\nI studied it for a long time, going over it again and again in my mind after she took it away.  I couldn’t make sense of it.  Of any of it.  I wasn’t smart enough, and I was failing her.\n\nRachel slept for a long time after that painting.  Then she got up on the fifth day, her last day, and immediately started working again.  This time she was painting faster, and while I saw her wince occasionally, she never lost her look of determination as she slashed lines and colors across the canvas.  When she was done, Rachel picked up the painting and turned it toward the camera, giving me a small, tired smile as she was blocked from view.\n\nIt was looking out from the front porch of a house somewhere.  It was out in the country, and the morning view of the yard and the land beyond were wonderful, but closer-up the painting was of two hands.  Holding onto each other tightly, their interlocked fingers seemed to glow red and orange in the light of the rising sun.  I found myself crying as I looked at it.  \n\nPart of it was because I didn’t know what it meant, and I felt a growing sense of desperation at the thought that Rachel’s last works might be wasted on me.  Part was because I knew it had been five days, and I could sense I was close to the end.  To her end.\n\nBut there was something more to it than all that too.  The last painting…even with everything else in my head and my heart pulling me down…gave me hope.  Hope of what, I didn’t know.  But I started to think that maybe the only message Rachel had for me in that last painting was that somehow, somewhere, everything would be okay.\n\nOutside the edge of the painting I could see motion in the room.  People hurriedly coming in with some kind of medical equipment.  And then the monitor went black.\n\n****\n\n“You’ve done well, Thomas.  Very, very well.  For the last five days of video, we had charted one thousand and forty-seven microvariations in Rachel’s behavior that we believed might correspond to your behavior, your reactions, and your emotional states while watching the video.  Like before, the two of you remained in sync as though you were in the same room.  It really is remarkable.”\n\nI sat staring at Solomon.  I listened to what he said, but I didn’t care.  I just wanted it over.  Whatever this was, I just wanted it over.\n\nClearing his throat, he went on.  “That’s why we’ve decided to move the implant from Rachel’s body to your own.  That’s one of the many reasons we’ve preserved her so.  The foreign body was still showing signs of life all this time, but just barely, and we were afraid to attempt removal.  Our hope is that, given your connection to Rachel, it will accept you.  Perhaps even thrive in you more than it ever did our girl.”\n\nI was suddenly on my feet, and it was only the raising of Solomon’s gun that stopped me from attacking him.  “Don’t you fucking talk about her like that.  Like any of you gave a shit about her.  I’ll fucking kill you.”\n\nSolomon’s face darkened slightly as his lips thinned.  “No, you won’t.  But if idle threats make you feel better, go ahead.  It will only make things harder, not easier.”\n\nFeeling a stab of panicked fear, I sat back down.  “What is this thing you’re going to put in me?”\n\nThe man looked at me for several seconds before responding.  “I’m tempted not to tell you after your stupid—and frankly, hurtful—outburst.  But I’ll be the bigger person.”  Letting out a small sigh, he went on.  “Thomas, somewhere there is a tree.  A very special tree.  We suspect it is the same tree that Rachel painted for you that time, though we cannot say for sure, as we have never been able to find it.  It is either hidden away very well or it is able to hide itself from those it wishes.”\n\nI just looked at him, trying to kill him by just wanting it to be so.  “In any case, we have the next best thing.  An ancient clipping from the tree.  Secured at great cost and sacrifice, and studied for a long time without much success.  We have, however, in recent years been given…advice, that this clipping could be grown in the right soil.  We thought that soil was Rachel, but while it did develop further inside of her, she died before the necessary growth was finished.”\n\nLeaning forward, he smiled at me.  “We have it on fairly good authority, however, that you might succeed where she failed.”\n\n****\n\nI fought them when they came, but it didn’t matter.  I woke up some time later with a dull ache in my chest and a small, already healing scar on my upper stomach.  I didn’t really feel that different other than the little bit of pain, but I knew that would change with time.  Maybe I had more time than Rachel, or maybe I had less.  It didn’t matter.  I just…\n\n*Wait, what was that?*\n\nThere was some kind of soft voice…coming from where?  It wasn’t in the room.  It was in my head.  I felt a thrill of excitement.  Maybe this was Rachel’s voice.  She had somehow stayed in the tree thing they had put inside me?\n\nBut no.  I had never heard Rachel’s voice, but I sensed this wasn’t it.  This voice was too delicate to really be heard or understood, and it reminded me of music coming from a distant room that you felt in the back of your mind without realizing it.  It was a…a melody, a kind of song.  But it wasn’t Rachel’s song.  I realized with a shiver that it was the song of the thing inside of me.\n\nAt first I was afraid, but that didn’t last long.  It wasn’t trying to hurt me.  It was trapped here just like I was.  *But*, it started to sing, *it was time for us to be free.*\n\nI stood up and walked to the door, and as I did so, the lights went out.  The door in front of me clicked, and when I reached out and turned the knob in the dark, it opened easily.  How was this possible?  And if it could do this, why hadn’t it helped Rachel get out?  There was no answer, but there was also no time.  I could already hear boots around the corner as the glow from flashlights began to light up the far end of the hall.  \n\nThey would drag me back in there.  Chain me up or take this thing back out of me before we could get away.  If I was ever going to get out, it had to be now.  The voice was singing again, pushing me to go further into the dark, to run until we were safe.\n\nSo I listened and I ran.\n\n****\n\nEvery door unlocked for me, every turn kept me barely out of sight.  The people looking for me were barking orders over a radio, asking someone what was the hold up on the generator kicking on.  Whatever the response, the hallways stayed dark as I drifted through them blind but not falling, lost but not being found.  \n\nWhen I reached the final door, I opened it into a bright afternoon.  My lungs burned a little at the first fresh, unrecycled air I had breathed in a week.  Blinking, I waited for the voice to tell me where to go, but it had fallen silent.  I closed the door as panic began to rise in my chest.  All this and I would get caught because I didn’t know where to go.  I was outside a plain brown building in the middle of nowhere.  There was a road going off to the right, and to the left there was…\n\n*Rachel’s forest, from her first painting to me.*\n\nI knew it was the same forest immediately, and not just because of it matching the painting so closely.  I had some strange sense that felt like a kind of magnetism, or how birds know which way to fly.  Looking around for a second, I felt like I was being pulled when I looked again at those woods.  This was right.  Somehow, I knew this was the way I needed to go.\n\nSo I went.\n\nI had made it to the edge of the forest when I heard the noise of men coming outside the building.  I thought about hiding, but I knew it was a bad idea.  They would just catch me, and I felt a drive to go deeper into the woods.  I plunged ahead, running at close to a reckless speed but never tripping or stumbling as I went.  I would occasionally hear a noise behind me as they spread out to search, but the sounds grew fainter as I ran.  I almost thought I had lost them for good when I heard a short cough that was quickly muffled off to my left.  Someone had gotten close without me knowing it. \n\nPanicking, I looked for any places I could hide.  There were only bushes and trees and…over there.  A well.  Not just *a* well, but Rachel’s well, with the same worn, grey stone walls capped with a weathered wooden lid.  I felt a moment of happy recognition, but then it faded away.  How did that help?  They’d check the well if they found it, and I didn’t have any way to get down in it without getting hurt or stuck.  Then an idea stuck me.\n\nCrouching low and staying to the brush, I moved to the well and gingerly pushed on the lid.  At first it resisted, but when I pushed a bit harder, the wooden circle slid aside enough that you could clearly see someone moved it.  Glancing around, I eased back into the bushes as I heard soft footfalls approaching.\n\n“We need to check this out.”\n\n“You think he went down the well?  Better hope not.  He probably broke his neck if he did, and then its our asses.”\n\nI could see the two men approaching.  Both of them were wearing dark body armor and carried assault rifles.  The older of the two shrugged back at the other one.  “Better that than he was hiding in there and we *didn’t* check.”\n\nLooking irritated, the younger man nodded.  “I’ll look.”  He went over to the well and shoved the wooden lid aside, causing it to clatter to the ground.  Hitting a button on his rifle, a flashlight sprang to life on the barrel.  He started to shine it down into the well as the other continued to look in every direction.  I was worried he would see me if I moved, but I couldn’t wait.  I just had to stay calm.  Think slow and move fast.\n\nI kept expecting to hear them yell, or feel something or someone strike me in the back, but nothing came.  As the afternoon light began to dim, I saw the trees thinning ahead.  I was approaching a road.  It looked like a normal, public road too, with several cars passing one way or the other as I walked out of the forest and up the hill to the asphalt.\n\nThe idea of hitchhiking, especially this close to where they held me, was frightening, but I saw little choice.  I was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt they had given me and my own shoes, but I had no money or ID or phone.  My only chance was to get far enough away that I could try and get help.\n\nI jumped slightly at the hiss of hydraulic brakes as a large semi rolled to a stop next to me.  The passenger window rolled down and an older man with white hair and a greying mustache leaned over and peered down at me.  \n\n“You look lost, son.  You need a ride?”\n\nI looked down at the door of the truck.  It had a logo that said “Martinez and Sons Construction and Hauling”  Below it was a cartoon man hitting a wall with a sledgehammer.  Looking back up, I smiled at him.\n\n“Yes sir, I do.”\n\n****\nI woke up five hours later as we pulled into a truck stop somewhere in Nevada.  I had planned on staying awake the entire trip, but that had only lasted a few minutes before exhaustion overtook me.  I glanced over at Oliver Martinez and he gave me a toothy grin.\n\n“I’m tired, but you were plumb tuckered out.  I’ve got to fuel up, shower and get some grub.  I’m going on to California after that.  If you want to ride further, just be back here in an hour.  Sound good?”\n\nI nodded and thanked him again for the ride as I got out.  I felt groggy from sleeping, but otherwise okay.  I just needed to decide whether this was a good spot to ask for help or if I should ride with Martinez further.  He seemed like a very nice guy, and he would probably try to help if he could, but I wanted to avoid putting more people in danger if I could help it.  Looking around, I saw we were in a fairly nice little town.  I decided I would go look around for a few minutes and then decide what to do.\n\nI was only three blocks down the street when I saw the flickering lights in the distance.  It was a movie theater.  As I got closer, I felt my chest tightening.  It was the one from Rachel’s painting.\n\n****\n\n“Hey there.  Welcome to the Phoenix.”\n\nThe guy standing at the candy counter of the theater looked a little younger than me, and while he seemed friendly enough, he also looked slightly concerned.\n\n“If you’re here for the horror double-feature, I’m afraid the second movie is about thirty minutes in.  I can give you a half-rate if you want to see it though.”\n\nI shook my head and tried to not look as strange and crazy as I felt.  “No, that’s okay.  I…well, I recognized this place from a picture a friend of mine painted.  So I came in to ask if you knew anything about her.”\n\nHe raised his eyebrows and shrugged.  “Okay, weird.”  He smiled and added, “Weird but interesting.  Who is she?”\n\nI swallowed.  “Her name is…well, it was, Rachel Donovan.”\n\nI expected him to look surprised or excited or angry, but I could see right away the name meant nothing to him.  Shaking his head, he shrugged again.  “Sorry, that doesn’t ring a bell.  I’d say you could ask the owner, but he’s on vacation this week.”\n\nNodding, I searched my mind for something else to ask, some way to make this place matter the way her other paintings had.  “Is there anything unique about this place then?  Its history or something?”\n\nThe man grinned.  “Buddy, you’re clearly not from here.  This place is super boring.  Not just the theater, but the whole town.”  Frowning in thought, he added.  “The only thing I know about the history of this place is that there used to be a house here that burned down.  This was like in the 1920s or 30s when this wasn’t even a part of town.  Couldn’t tell you the first thing about it beyond that, but I still bet it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened here.”\n\nI let out a disappointed sigh.  “Okay.  Well, thanks.”  I turned to leave when the guy called out again.\n\n“Hey man, sorry I couldn’t help more.  If you come back, I’ll get you a discount on a movie.  Half-off.  If I’m not working, tell them Marshall said it was okay.”\n\nI waved and tried to smile as I headed for the door with a heavy heart.  Why did you lead me here, Rachel?  What’s here that will help?\n\nI was outside again, staring up at the theater’s bright blinking signs as though they were going to give me some kind of secret signal, when I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  There was an alley that ran along side the theater and went behind it to…something.  Whatever was back there, the light of a distant security lamp cast shadows along the wall of the alley, and those shadows were moving.\n\nInstead of feeling afraid, I felt excited as I started down the alley.  Rachel had led me here, and I just had to trust that there was a reason for it.  Keep looking until I…\n\nThe shadows were made by leaves blowing in some wind I couldn’t feel.  As I got to the far end of the alley, I saw there was a small back yard behind the theater surrounded by a chain link fence, and on the other side of that fence was the tree from Rachel’s painting, with its deep red twisting bark and foam of green leaves waving to and fro in the night air.\n\nI felt a surge of warmth in my chest as the distant singing began again.  This was the place.  The special tree that could not be found unless it wanted you to find it.  It sat at the edge of a small overgrown lot surrounded on all sides by buildings and yards, somehow forgotten when whatever this land had once been was divided up, and despite its location, I had a strong sense that I was the first to see it in a very long time.\n\nClimbing the fence, I felt a jagged wire dig into my leg and rip my pants as I fell over the top.  I was bleeding a little, but I hardly noticed.  I could smell the tree now, and it was a rich, good smell unlike any I had smelled before.  Reaching out to it, I felt the singing grow louder as I touched it.  I felt stronger and less afraid then, and when I saw the light opening up at its roots, I didn’t tremble, I smiled.\n\nThere was a hidden tunnel under the tree.  A tunnel filled with sweet-smelling air that was like the tree smell but also different.  And the tunnel wasn’t dark—no, not at all.  It glowed with its own golden light that called to me, urged me forward.  Rain was beginning to fall as I looked around the dark lot.  I had the thought that I was leaving this world behind.\n\nAnd I found I didn’t mind that much at all.\n\nThe tunnel had continued to grow, slanting down gently and tall enough that I walked in without stooping.  The roots of the tree went on and on, woven through the dirt walls as I went deeper.  I looked back and saw the tunnel had closed behind me, but I wasn’t surprised.  The way forward was the only way that mattered.\n\nI walked for what might have been hours, but I never felt tired or hungry.  And I never worried I was lost, though I had no idea where I was or where I was going.  Still, I felt a surge of happiness and excitement when I turned a corner and saw something in the tunnel ahead.  As I got closer I realized it was a brick wall, but just as I began to think I had found a dead end, the wall faded away, revealing a dark room.\n\nI paused at the edge of the tunnel, looking out at the floor of what looked like a basement.  It was empty, but in the light from the tree I could make out something scratched into the floor.  It was the number two.  I felt my pulse quicken as I thought back to Rachel’s painting with the theater seats, and then I stepped out into the room.\n\nIt was the empty basement of a house, and as I went up the stairs and opened the door, I saw that the rest of the house was empty as well.  No lights were on, but bright sunlight poured in through every window and in the distance I could hear what sounded like small waves crashing on a beach.  I wanted to go out and see where I was, but I forced myself to check the house first for any people or clues.  But there were none.  The house was utterly bare of any sign of people other than the number scratched into the floor below.\n\nMy nose tingled with salty air as I stepped outside.  The house was near the beach on what I soon figured out was a small, deserted island, and I realized with little surprise that I recognized the house from Rachel’s painting.  As I stepped off the porch, I saw no signs of people, but I wasn’t entirely alone.  Because sitting some distance from the house, was the tree.  \n\nI knew it couldn’t be the same tree as in the abandoned lot, but at the same time I knew that it was.  Or at least a different part of the same tree that made the tunnels and appeared in my old world and whatever place this was.  \n\nBecause I had started having that thought as soon as I stepped out of the house.  I didn’t think this was my world.  Not exactly.  I could see a larger island some distance away, and it might have people on it.  Hotels and cars and planes.  Or it might not, as those things might not exist here.  Either way, my newfound intuition was growing stronger, and I could tell that the…what was it called?  The con…no, the texture of things was different somehow, if only a little.  Not bad or scary, just different.\n\nStill, after a couple of hours exploring the island and checking the house, I began to feel terribly lonely, even with the tree nearby.  I decided to go back into the tunnel and keep going.  The basement wall faded away as I walked up to it, and I entered the tunnels again.\n\nIt was only a short time later that I found my second version of the house.  Much like the first, the wall faded away into a basement, but this one was far from empty.  It was a workshop of some kind, full of tools I wasn’t familiar with.  I glanced down and saw “43” scratched onto the floor.  Who was doing that?  And why?\n\nI was going to explore the house, more carefully this time, as it looked like there were people here, but then I froze.  Propped against the brick wall, next to a small stack of boards, was a sledgehammer.  Trying to be quiet, I crept over and picked it up before heading back into the tunnel.\n\n****\n\nWhen I was little, before Daddy died, he had loved to hunt.  I never went with him and didn’t remember much of what he hunted, but I do know he had an old hound he’d had since before I was born.  The dog had only loved him—well, him and being on the trail of something.  When Rocker (his name was Rockerfeller) got a scent, it was like he was in a trance.  He would go and go, this way and that, and to look at him, it looked like he was having a fit—both lost and certain at the same time.  But whatever Rocker knew or didn’t know, he always found what he was looking for. \n\nI felt like Rocker now.  I was moving faster and faster as I went down this turn and that.  I felt like I was on the trail of something or traveling on memories I didn’t have.  Gripping the sledgehammer tightly, I could hear the rising hum of the distant music in my head as I turned the last corner, and then it fell silent.\n\nThere was another brick wall, and as I approached, it fell away.\n\nIt was another basement room, but this one was much smaller.  It contained a table, a clothes chest, and an old metal bed that had been broken apart.  At the far brick wall, a woman was using one of the metal legs from the bed to attack the wall and whatever lay behind it.  I felt my head began to swim as I looked at her from behind, and as she turned to look at me, eyes wide with surprise and fear, I felt the sledgehammer slip from my grip as I stumbled back against the now solid wall.  I could barely breathe at all, but I managed to get out a single word.\n\n“Rachel?”\n\nThe woman looked at me, her expression less fearful but still guarded.  She had the bed leg partially raised in warning.  [“Yeah?  Do I know you?”](https:\/\/redd.it\/8uj33q)\n\n****\n \n**** \n\n**** \n\n**** \n\n\n\n\nIt was her, but it wasn’t, much like the tree on the island.  This Rachel looked a few years older, and while she looked stressed and confused at the moment, her eyes didn’t seem weighted down by the same quiet sadness I had come to recognize watching the other Rachel for all that time.  Still, I didn’t know how to answer her question and not sound creepy or crazy.  I stared at her for a second, floundering, when she asked another.\n\n“You came out of the tree tunnel, right?”\n\nI nodded, grateful for something I could answer easily.\n\nStudying me, she said.  “Where did you come from?  Before the tunnel I mean.”\n\nI flushed as I tried to think of the right words.  “Um, well, I came from Texas.  Originally I mean.”\n\nShe grinned at me for a second before catching herself and trying to look serious again.  “Yeah, okay.  But like…do you know how the tree works?  How did you find out about the tunnel?  How did you get here?”\n\nSighing, I rubbed my head and just started into it.\n\n“Look, I know this will sound crazy, but I had a job watching a woman trapped in a room, and that woman was you, or another version of you, and she asked me for help, and I couldn’t help her and then they took me, and I found out she had been dead for a long time but could see me in the future and then they put something from the tree in me that had been in her that killed her and then I escaped and then I figured out where to go to find the tree from things she had painted and I somehow knew how to go in the tunnels to find different spots, and I’m pretty sure the tunnels lead to different worlds and I got this sledgehammer and then I…”\n\n“Hold up.  God damn.  Take a breath.  You’re going to pass out.”  She was smiling again, and this time she didn’t try to hide it.  She looked over what was left of the bed to where the sledgehammer was laying on the floor.  “And did you say sledgehammer?”\n\n****\n\n**Whack**\n\n“So yeah, I believe you.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n“I’ve been in those tunnels too.  My ex-boyfriend tricked me into moving here so he could tie me to the tree in his place.”\n\n**Whack** \n\n“Well, not tie me to the tree literally.  Take his place as…what?  The tree’s buddy or something?  I don’t really know.  It’s all pretty fucked up and I don’t understand all of it.”\n**Whack**\n\n“But what I do understand is that the fucker walled me up in here.  At first, I thought I could just pry loose some bricks over time, but nope.  He put a layer of concrete on the outside this time.  Good ol’ Phil.  Or Justin.  Or whatever.  I mainly think of him as Fuckface now.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n“This is taking forever.”\n\nI stepped up and put my hand on the sledgehammer.  “Let me do it for a bit.  We can take turns.”  We had cleared away even more brick than she had already managed, but the concrete wall was only starting to show small cracks.  I wanted to just keep looking at her, have her talk to me, but I knew she was tired.  She nodded reluctantly and let go of the hammer.  Before I swung, I looked back at her.  “How long have you been in here like this?”\n\n**Whack** \n\nRachel scowled.  “It’s hard to say for sure, but I think about eight months.”\n\nI let the hammer drop down again as my eyes widened.  “How did you survive all that time?”\n\nHer scowl deepened.  “It’s the tree.  It won’t let me die.  I just dip into the tunnel every day for a bit and I never get that hungry or thirsty.”\n\nA thought occurred to me then.  “Why didn’t you just escape through the tunnels?”\n\nShe quickly shook her head.  “No, thank you.  I’ve had enough of seeing other worlds.  Some of them aren’t so nice.  And I don’t want to be more tied to the tree than I already am.  I just want out of here, into my own world, and then I can try and figure out how to get free of my connection to the tree for good.”  Rachel shrugged.  “I would have done it eventually with the stupid bed parts, but who knows how long it would have taken?”  She smiled again.  “I’m very happy you came to help and brought a sledgehammer with you.”\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded as I lifted the hammer again.  “Me too.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n****\n\nWe were both wringing with sweat when we crawled through the hole we’d made in the outer wall.  Rachel told me that she thought her ex-boyfriend was long gone, but she couldn’t be sure, so we had to be careful.  Grabbing the sledgehammer from inside the room, we made our way toward the stairs.\n\nThe house was decorated but quiet, and we saw no sign of anyone as we walked to the front door and opened it.  Outside, the sun was coming up on a new day, and as we walked out onto the porch, I jumped a little as Rachel took my hand and gave it a squeeze.  I looked over at her.  \n\nI hadn’t been able to help the other Rachel, but maybe that had never been the point at all.  Because I thought now she had been able to see more than just other places or the future.  She had been able to see into other worlds and possibilities. \n\nLike this one, where another version of her was trapped and needed help.  A place where I wouldn’t be hunted and she could be free.  In the end, even when she knew she was dying, Rachel had been determined to help us be together and happy.\n\nThe morning sun painted beautiful colors on Rachel’s face, and looking into her eyes I saw how much she was like the woman I had watched and cared about and tried to save.  The woman who, in the end, had saved me instead.  I wanted to tell Rachel so many things, ask her so many questions, but all that could come later.  Squeezing her hand back, I walked with her away from the house.\n\n[For now, this was enough.](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue253)\n\n****\n\n[You have a delivery scheduled.](https:\/\/redd.it\/cbn7uj)\n\n[The Ghost Tree](https:\/\/redd.it\/kfvzse)"},"248":{"title":"We’ve been stuck in construction traffic for 8 hours now.

The last guy who got out was shot in the legs and then run over by a tank.\n\nWe set out yesterday from Gainesville, Florida, where Lauren had recently graduated from law school. We were moving to my home state of Maine, to start a permanent life together. The drive was beautiful most of the way, and Lauren and I spent a lot of time on speaker phone with each other to comment on it. A couple of times we passed through rain, and once a really wild thunderstorm that lit up the whole sky for miles. Then, about 8 hours ago, we hit a traffic jam on I-95 just outside of Lewiston, Maine.\n\nI took a look at the navigation thing on my phone, but it didn’t show any red areas of heavy delay. It also had some trouble showing my exact location, though, so I lit a cigarette and figured it would just be a few minutes.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, I called Lauren. “How’s it going back there?” I asked. In the background, I could hear the cats going nuts.\n\n“Not great,” said Lauren. “Do you hear Hankie and Hattie howling? They started up as soon as we stopped. What's going on?”\n\n“Must be an accident that just happened. My phone usually gives a heads up if there’s planned construction or something.” I heard one of the cats hiss while the other one yowled.\n\n“I’m so tired,” said Lauren.\n\n“I know, me too. Let’s stop and get something to eat once we’re through, yeah?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“Alright. Love you. Sorry about the cats.”\n\n“Love you,” said Lauren.\n\nI hung up and tried to get something on the radio. I have a base model 2006 Toyota Tundra, so no AUX jack, and the CD player had broken years ago. During the entire trip, I had been at the mercy of radio stations, and for the most part, they didn’t do much for me other than create a general atmosphere of annoyance.\n\nNow, though, I couldn't even keep the radio on. What wasn't warbling static was some kind of distorted robotic voice reading off a list of numbers and random words strung together. Across the whole radio band, same thing. I couldn't take it so I shut it off.\n\nI picked my phone back up and went to check Twitter. All I got was that game where you have to jump the dinosaur over cacti faster and faster and then it gets dark out and the birds come. No internet. Finally, Twitter did half-load, so there was *some* intermittent reception there, barely.\n\nAfter a half hour had passed, I started to get antsy, and so did everyone else. People were sticking their heads out the window to try to see what was going on, but it was no use. The line of cars seemed endless. A few people got out of their vehicles to try to get a better look. I got out too and started walking to Lauren’s car.\n\nWhen I was halfway there, a voice cut into the air. It sounded like someone shouting through a bullhorn. “Return immediately to your vehicles! No one is permitted to be outside! This is your only warning. If you do not heed it, there will be severe consequences.”\n\n“Wha da *fuck* is goin’ on?!” some guy shouted in a thick Boston accent; he was standing a few car lengths in front of me. An instant later, he was down on the ground, not moving. I didn’t see what happened exactly, but that was enough to make me to hustle back to my truck.\n\nI tried calling Lauren again. When she answered all that I could hear were broken flashes of the cats screaming and Lauren sounding scared and begging to know what was happening.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said, not sure that she could hear it. “Maybe they’re searching for a criminal or something. I don’t know.” Then we were disconnected.\n\nA minute later, an ambulance was wailing its way down the right hand shoulder. It stopped just past my truck, and two EMTs jumped out of the back. They closed the doors behind them, but I saw that there was somebody else in there. Somebody dressed in riot gear, holding a big gun.\n\nThe EMTs dragged the guy with the Boston accent by the arms over to the ambulance. They opened the doors and sort of tossed him in, and then followed behind. I saw the riot gear person again for a second, and then the doors slammed shut and the ambulance sped off down the shoulder out of sight.\n\nSomebody four cars ahead of me got the idea to follow the ambulance out of there. I watched as a red Hyundai Sonata with a New Jersey license plate tore into the shoulder lane and sped after the ambulance.\n\nI tried calling Lauren to ask her if she thought we should try it too. It was a ballsy move for sure, but she had sounded at the end of her rope stuck in there with our wailing cats, so I thought she might be willing to give it a shot. This time, the call didn’t even go through.\n\nI was getting ready to try calling again when I heard this loud blast. A puff of smoke blossomed somewhere up ahead, and all of a sudden, there were chunks of a car flying through the air. A red car. Very likely a red Hyundai Sonata.\n\nAs I watched a flaming tire roll to a stop against the highway divider, I decided not to replicate New Jersey’s maneuver.\n\nI heard the blast of a horn behind me, and looked in the rearview to see that Lauren had her arm out the window, moving her hand around in a circle. Finally, it hit me that she was telling me to roll down my window, so that’s what I did.\n\n“Can you hear me?” she shouted.\n\n“I can!” I could even hear the cats. They sounded really freaked out.\n\n“What is happening?!” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know baby! I think we’re in some kind of military lockdown maybe! I think we have to just sit tight here.”\n\n“Can you throw me a bottle?” asked Lauren.\n\n“What?”\n\n“A bottle! Like Gatorade or something. I know that you’ve probably got ten of them in your front seat.\n\nIt was true. Not ten exactly, but close enough. I just threw all of my trash on the seat of my truck until it started overflowing, whereas Lauren kept her car clean. “What are you going to do with the bottle?” I asked.\n\n“Not something I want to shout out for the whole world to hear!” said Lauren. “Let’s just say we’ve been here a while and I don’t think we’re coming to a rest stop soon enough.”\n\nFinally, I understood. I reached over and grabbed a bottle. I chucked it out the window, but it was a bad throw, and bounced off the hood of Lauren’s Honda. I tried again, and this time she caught it. She rolled up her window and in the rearview mirror I watched her fuss around as she presumably tried to pee into the thing.\n\nThis was when the fleet of massive trucks started rolling in, on the southbound side of the highway divide. Some of them had cranes sitting on long flat beds, and others had big chunks of some kind of metal material. Soon, the southbound side was jammed up with these giant trucks and their haul. Then they started to get to work.\n\n“What are they doing?!” asked Lauren. She’d opened her window back up. “Are they… building a fucking *wall*?!”\n\nThat is exactly what it looked like they were doing. One crane would take a massive chunk of material, and lift it into place either next to, or on top of, another chunk.\n\n“Yes! They’re walling us in!” I shouted. I checked my phone for the thousandth time. I had a bar, and used it to call 911.\n\nA lady answered. “What is the address for this emergency?”\n\n“I… uh… I-95 northbound, just before Lewiston, Maine. I forget the exit number we were coming up on. I’m sorry.”\n\n“That’s okay. What is the emergency?”\n\n“Well… we’re in this weird traffic jam… and… people are dying here. Cars are exploding. They’re building a wall around us. They’re trapping us here. I know that sounds crazy….”\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end. I thought maybe we’d been disconnected. But then I heard her voice again, crystal clear.\n\n“Sir, I am going to need you to remain calm and stay in your vehicle. And if you would, roll down your window. Not the driver’s side, the passenger’s side.”\n\n“W… what?” I asked. Then I heard the tapping at my window. There was a lady cop standing there, holding a cell phone up to her ear. My heart jumped up into my throat, and my instinct was to slam my foot on the gas pedal, but there was nowhere to go. I rolled down the window.\n\n“You reported an emergency?” asked the cop. “Everything looks okay to me. We don’t discourage anyone from calling emergency services if they truly think that there might be an emergency situation occurring, but everything appears to be perfectly fine here. I will give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but remember that we also very strongly frown upon fraudulent 911 calls. You could be charged for that, sir. It’s no joke.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, trying to hold it together. “I’m sorry about that. I *did* think that something bad was going on, but now I see that everything is okay. Thanks for checking in.”\n\n“It’s no problem at all, sir,” said the cop, smiling. “And remember: *stay in your vehicle*.”\n\n“Of course,” I said, trying to smile, though I’m sure my face looked like a sweaty pretzel instead.\n\nThe cop nodded and then walked off down the line of cars. I waited a few minutes, and then called out to Lauren.\n\n“I think we’re fucked!” I said. “I called 911 and that cop that was just here? She’s the one who picked up. She said everything’s fine… but it’s not.”\n\n“Fuck!” said Lauren. “What do we do?!”\n\nThat’s when the guy jumped out of his car and made a break for the wooded area to the right of the highway. And that’s when they shot him in the legs. I heard him cry out and watched him hit the ground. I heard a loud continuous rumble, interspersed with snaps from the woods. Then I saw the tank. It didn’t so much emerge from the woods as it destroyed the woods in its wake. Beyond it, I saw another enormous wall. We were walled-in from two sides… and my guess was that we were walled-in from four sides.\n\nThe tank crushed the man like he was a particularly small ant.\n\n\\*\n\nThey are working on the roof now. It's almost done. Once the roof is on, I have a feeling that I won't get any reception at all. Before that happens, I'm hoping for one more spike so that I can get this post out.\n\nI don't know if this is on the news or not. I thought it was just a traffic jam, so that's probably how they're playing it off. They probably have rerouted traffic around us by now.\n\nI don't know what this is. But there are now dozens of heavily armed people in riot gear going from car to car. Sometimes they drag somebody out, and carry them screaming off to what remains of the wooded area, where they disappear from sight.\n\nThey're almost at my truck now. I hope they skip me, and Lauren. Oh God. I'm going to tell her that I love her.\n\nIf this reaches you, I don't know what you can do, but please try to help us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bxoscy\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/byqo1k\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)"},"249":{"title":"The Chernobyl disaster was a coverup of something terrifying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bz0dl9\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/","flair":"Series","author":"DELTA129","selftext":"Narrations:  \n\n\n[Mr. Creeps](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pylxyu24g1g)  \n\n[The Dark Somnium](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_rDRRXlCdC4)  \n\n**TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP DMing ME ID THE STORY IS TRUE**: Please see the description and nature of the subreddit where it is posted.\n  \n\n\n  \nYou probably heard about tourism in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. I’ve been there myself several times. And it’s nothing like what you see in games or horror movies. There are no ghosts, mutants or radioactive anomalies and death isn’t waiting for you at every corner. Actually, I think it’s one of the most peaceful and prettiest places on Earth. An example of strength of nature and how it can reverse the damage that we caused it.\n\nThus, when my friend Alexei decided to go there, he knew who to contact. He's a physics student and right now he’s doing some kind of research on nuclear fallout and he said that he wanted to get some direct measurements and samples. But we both knew that it’s just an excuse to go on an “adventure”. We visited the old powerplant, the abandoned city Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone. It was nice, but I would probably just bore you with more details. That part is not important anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were driving on some dirt roads in a forest east of Pripyat when we found it. An old, rusty fence and a chained gate that blocked any further passage. There was a big sign with a radiation hazard symbol and captioned: “Restricted area. Authorized personnel only”.\n\nThere was a pair of massive metal blast doors in the side an artificially-looking hill not far behind the fence, with a large, white “O-13” painted on it and “NO ENTRY” sprayed on top.\n\n“What do you think it is?” Alex asked.\n\n“I don’t know, looks like some kind of bunker,” I replied. “And it looks like it has been closed for some time,” I added after taking a closer look at the doors. The both halves were welded shut in the center. Alex took his samples and readings, but we were too puzzled to leave just yet.\n\n“Do you think we can get in?” I asked.\n\n“Well not this way for sure. Even if it wasn’t welded sealed, I’m sure we have no way of unlocking it.” Alex replied while examining the massive door.\n\n“It looks like an underground bunker. They must have had a way to pump air inside and I don’t think this is it. There has to be another way to get in.” I said.\n\nWe circled the main entrance to try find other means of entry. The day was already coming to an end and it was slowly getting darker. As we were searching, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhy would they weld the doors? What’s so important inside that they went this far to keep people away?\n\n“Look, there’s something there,” Alex pulled me away from my thoughts.\n\nIt was a concrete block a couple of meters large with what looked like vents on the sides. As I looked into the vents, I noticed that they were also sealed with heavy-looking steel hatches and no clear way to open them. However, there was also a somewhat smaller door labeled “Service tunnel” with a large wheel on the outside.\n\n“Should I open it?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, I’m really wonder what this is. Anyway, we don’t have to go in. At least we’ll see if the door still works.\n\nAt first, the wheel wouldn’t turn because of all the rust and dirt, but eventually it budged. The door unlocked. I pulled and it slowly started opening. It was very heavy and took a lot of force.\n\nBehind the door, there was a small platform and a tight vertical tunnel with a ladder. What caught my attention was that there was an identical locking mechanism on the inside. That meant that they could lock the door from both sides. But why? We were lucky, because if they had locked it from the inside too, there would be no way to get in.\n\nI stepped inside and shined my phone light down the shaft. It wasn’t strong enough to hit the bottom. The air was damp and old and there was something that I couldn’t identify. A very faint, chemical-like smell. There was no radiation nor signs of any other hazards.\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me. This is so cool. We have to come back here and check it out later.” Alex said.\n\nI couldn’t agree more.\n\nIt was almost dark now, so we resealed the door and called it a day. But we promised ourselves to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately tried to do some research when I got home, unfortunately with no success. I even tried to call Pavel, a friend of mine who knew the area better than me. Actually, it was him who brought me there for the first time. He couldn’t help me either, but promised to ask around. I told him about our plan and asked if he wouldn’t go with us, but unfortunately, he was out of the country for a while.\n\nA week later, we packed our gear and went on with it. We brought some rope, heavy flashlights, glowsticks, Geiger counters, waterproof protective clothes, an oxygen meter and a small emergency scuba tank just in case. And yeah, we’re not stupid so we told our relatives and friends about our trip and when we’re expecting to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe closed the door behind us as we descended down the access shaft. We couldn’t know what’s down there and we didn’t want to cause a radiation leak or something like that. We eventually dropped down into a concrete tunnel which enclosed the air vents and some smaller pipes. There was obviously no power and thus no lights. Good thing we brought our own.\n\nWe followed the tunnel and reached another door, but this time it was a regular one, not the heavy bunker-type. We went through and entered a room with 4 large air pumps and some electrical equipment and controls. The ventilation shafts split here into two larger ones that ran straight into ground and two smaller ones that went straight across the room where there was another set of doors.\n\nBehind the doors, there was a large hall with numerous boxes, crates and other cargo just laying around. There also was a security checkpoint. Behind the checkpoint, we found the main door that we have seen from the outside. Just next to it, there was some heavy lifting equipment. We returned through the checkpoint and taken a look at a set of elevators. There was a simple map with the layout of the facility floor by floor. We were on floor 0, main entry hall. There were another 4 floors below us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFloor -1: Offices, security and recreation\n\nFloor -2: Secure laboratories\n\nFloor -3: Accelerator, Cleanroom decontamination chamber\n\nFloor -4: Experiment site\n\nThe map was titled “Object-13”. It wasn’t a military bunker. This was a research site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe took a set of stairs, since the elevators were of no use without power. An unsettling thought brushed my mind as we were descending. They probably were moving some supplies, and then left them there and took the equipment to the main door. Were they trying to get out?\n\nI stepped on another stair step but something rolled away under my foot, lost my balance and fell on my back. My pack luckily absorbed the impact. I looked under my feet to see what caused my fall. Empty bullet casings.\n\nThis wasn’t the sole reason why I felt odd about this place. As soon as we got down to level -1, I noticed that every single door was open. Every single one. There was a canteen and a kitchen right at the beginning of a long rectangular corridor. Various offices surrounded the corridor. There was the regular stuff – paperwork, old computers, personal belongings, all right there where they left it. Did they leave in a hurry?\n\n“Dimitri!” Alex called from, the canteen on the opposite side of the corridor.\n\n“What?” was all I could say when I followed him to the canteen.\n\nThere was food still neatly served on the tables. But it wasn’t spoilt. It wasn’t fresh either, but it wasn’t decaying, as a 30-year-old meal should.\n\n“How is this possible?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know, maybe it was irradiated or something. But it’s not anymore, I checked that. I really don’t know man,” he answered, as puzzled as I was.\n\nOh, why didn’t we just turn back and leave? Now that I’m writing this, there were so many red flags already. Something really wrong happened down there. But I guess we were too excited and curious. But it was at this point that my excitement started to fade and be replaced with an eerie feeling.\n\nNevertheless, we continued and descended down to level -2. The stairwell ended here, and to go deeper, we would have to cross the entire floor to reach an another one on the opposite side. There was a security checkpoint and a large blast door that we had to pass through to reach the labs. Again, every door was wide open. However, the things that people left here weren’t neatly placed where they should have been. It was a mess everywhere. There were all kinds of rooms with all kinds of equipment that I didn’t understand. Occasionally, there were more empty bullet casings on the ground. There still was the one central rectangular corridor as above, but the rooms around it were like a little maze.\n\nAlmost at the other side of the floor, we found the head scientist’s office. As I said, everywhere it was a mess, but I found a logbook on the desk. There was only a handful of pages, the rest torn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. October 1984:** Today we successfully managed to translocate several atoms without changes in any physical properties. It’s going to be a long road until we can transport solid objects, but we’re going some good work here.\n\n**17. January 1985:** We’ve managed to transport an apple today. However, I couldn’t help but notice that the pattern of red and green skin on top was slightly different. But it was still the same apple, with the same structure, shape, everything. We also tried to transport some electronics. They were unharmed and in working order. I think that we still have a lot to perfect and learn about this technology, but we cannot slow down now. The country is relying on us.\n\n**21. February 1985:** After the animal trials, we translocated our first human today. He is alive and healthy, a brave hero of our nation. We have proven that this technology works now, but the practicality is still very limited due to the fixed translocation ratio. We still cannot “send” matter. Only exchange the positions of two equally massive objects. I have proposed a new type of device, that could possibly achieve one-way translocation of just a single object, but it would need an immense amount of energy.\n\n**1. May 1985:** Our superiors accepted my proposal. They are going to build a new, much bigger translocator here, in the power plant, so we can use a nuclear reactor as a direct power source. There is one more thing. We’ve now translocated dozens of test subjects. Each one is alive and well, but sometimes they are a little bit, well, different. They sometimes claim that various events in the past happened differently than they really did. Sometimes they claim to know people who don’t exist, or more alarming, they know people who they are not supposed to know. The following was written below with a pencil by hand: “Test subject 28 was speaking an unknown language and couldn’t understand any real language after the experiment.”\n\nThere was a lot of missing pages afterwards.\n\n**25. April 1986:** We are going to try to change our approach. It’s been more than a year, and we’re still unsuccessful in eliminating the translocation symmetry anomaly. We still event don’t know what is causing it, but we are not going to make any progress this way. Today, we are going to try to access the conduit reality instead.  Even though Unit 2 - the one we built in the power plant - is still new, we are going to use it for this experiment. Who knows what wonders are waiting for us on the other side?\n\nThere was one last page in the logbook. On it, it was just a single phrase, written again and again:\n\n# “WE LET THEM IN”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Alex, I think we should go,” I called.\n\n“Man, come take a look at this,” he answered.\n\nI stepped out of the lab and back into the hallway.\n\nThere were … clothes all over the corridor. Well what was left of them. They were torn to shreds. No bodies, no blood, just strips of cloth and an occasional shoe or a watch.  I looked up and stared down the dark corridor in front of us. I just stood there for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was, I don't know ... as if something torn all these people to shreds, and then cleaned it all up. Except the clothes and other non-organic material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA wave of pure, instinctive dread washed over me. I couldn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.\n\n“Let’s just get out of here.” Alex said.\n\nWe turned around and walked away. Slowly at first, but we quickened our pace. Our footsteps echoed across the underground structure.\n\n“I just want to be out of here man. We shouldn’t have done this” Alex said. I didn’t tell him about the logbook, but…\n\nMy thoughts were cut short after a sudden realization.\n\nHis voice didn’t echo. It was just our footsteps.\n\nI think he realized too, because we both stopped and listened.\n\nNothing. Just silence.\n\nI stepped forward.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nI took another step.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nThere was this door just in front of us and I forced myself to try something. I closed it behind us as we passed it and placed a glass beaker that I found on the ground on top.\n\nI took a step forward.\n\nSilence\n\nIt was just echo after all, I thought.\n\nWe walked away, carefully at first, but then we once again quickened our pace. We turned around a corner, and then it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Crash*\n\nThe glass shattered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone\n\nor some thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust opened the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe dropped all our gear except our lights and ran as fast as we could. I didn’t even know I could run this fast. I always tried to be a tough guy but I was never so scared in my life.\n\nOur footsteps didn’t echo anymore. Or better said, they weren’t in sync with ours anymore. Something was running after us. Each second it was getting closer. And closer.\n\nAs soon as we reached the security checkpoint, we started closing the door. The rusty joint of the door squealed in protest, but we pulled with all our strength. We almost had it closed, when we heard a loud, guttural and unnatural growl.\n\nThe door slammed shut and I threw the wheel to the ‘locked’ position. My heart was pounding so hard that it was all I heard for a while.\n\nNo, wait, it wasn’t my heart. It was that thing, pounding on the locked blast door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were running again. We reached the stairwell and run up, taking 2-3 steps at once.\n\nWe finally reached the air pump room. The ascent really exhausted us and even though I was scared shitless, I felt like I would pass out if I took another step forward. Besides, we locked it down there.\n\nAlex sat down and leaned his back on one of the large vertical vents with a bang.\n\n*Bang. Bang. Bang…*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh fuck.\n\nWe locked it down there.\n\nBut we forgot the vents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlex and I looked at each other, our eyes met, and then… the vent burst and he was gone. I only heard him scream as he was dragged back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for doing this, but I just ran, I climbed the service shaft and locked the service door shut when I was finally out of this hell.\n\nAs soon as I had phone service again, my phone started beeping with loads and loads of missed calls and messages from Pavel.\n\n“Hey Dimitri, I found this guy, he says he knows what ‘O-13’ is. Please pick up as soon as you can, he says it’s dangerous and you should stay out of it.\n\n“This guy is calling me now, he sounds serious, please call me back at once”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on but he’s going there, please I hope you get this before you go down. Stay safe friend.”\n\nThere was also one message from an unknown number:\n\n“Dimitri, this is Anatoliy Moroz, I know what you found and I’m on my way from Kiev now. DO NOT GO DOWN THERE. If you already did and you manage to get out, lock the door that you used to get in and make sure it stays locked. I will try to call you when I’m here.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am, writing this while I wait. I do this to make sure that no one else repeats our mistake, since I don’t know if I’ll live long to tell anyone personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can’t leave Alex behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to go back.\n\n# [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c090ig\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/)"},"250":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

I rolled back to the desk and sat there, trying to stop from shaking, trying to make myself take a breath.  Think about it slow.  The first thing was, should I hit a button?\n\nThe red button was for an emergency.  If she *was* a prisoner or something, and she was trying to escape, they might think that was an emergency.  But no one had been hurt that I knew of.  And I think Mr. Solomon meant save that for something that was like a police or ambulance emergency, not something like this.  But what about the green button?\n\nThis was definitely something “noteworthy”.  Not only that she was asking for help, but that she was asking *me* for help.  \n\nI made myself stop for a moment.  I couldn’t know for sure she was asking me.  I had gone to school with several boys named Thomas.  It was a common name.  But the chances of her painting that name when I was working here?  I didn’t want to be silly, but I wasn’t trying to be too…what’s that word.  Mom used to say it when she read her angel books.  Skeptics.  I didn’t want to be a skeptic either.  I had to believe it was probably meant for me.  And that was something they would want to know.\n\nBut should I hit the green button?  My hands were drifting toward the metal box on the desk, but I hesitated.  I didn’t like breaking rules, and I was scared of what would happen if I broke these.  If they really were holding her prisoner, then they were probably very bad people.  But I didn’t know that.  Maybe they were good and *she* was bad.  But I just…\n\nI looked back at the monitor for the first time since reading the words.  Rachel was already moving the paintings back off the sofa, as though she knew the message had been received.  A canvas in each hand, she glanced up at the camera as she moved across the room, and it felt like she was looking right at me.  My chest tightened as my hands moved away from the buttons.  \n\nNo.  I didn’t think she was bad.  I had watched her for years.  I felt like I knew her, would know if she was bad.  Strange as it seemed, in a way she was my friend.  And I was going to try and help her.\n\n**** \n\nI spent the rest of my shift trying to act normal and think of what to do.  I knew whoever else was watching might have noticed the paintings or seen how I acted, but I couldn’t worry about that.  I would try to play it cool and try to think how I could help her.\n\nThe only people I had actually met connected to this job were a couple of people when I filled out the papers and then Mr. Solomon when he showed me the model room and told me the job.  I had no way of contacting any of them except through the buttons.  My checks were deposited electronically and I had never run into anyone else who worked at the surveillance room.\n\nThat thought made me stop a second.  I had always thought it was weird that I never ran into someone when I was coming or going—the person I was taking over for or the person who was taking over for me.  I had always figured there must be other people, other surveillance rooms even, and they just scheduled us so we didn’t run into each other.  And I still thought there were others.\n\nPart of why I thought that was because it seemed like I wasn’t the only person who used my surveillance room.  The water cooler, the toilet paper, the soap, they all seemed go down faster than I think I was using it by myself.  If that was true, maybe I could figure out who they were, and maybe they would be safer to talk to than whoever it was that I worked for.\n\nI got off work at eight that night, and instead of grabbing some food and going home, I drove my car around the block and then parked down the street from the building where I worked.  Nothing had changed while I drove around for a minute—no new cars had parked or anything—and if I was right, they didn’t send anyone to replace me until they were sure I was gone anyhow.  \n\nSo I sat and waited.\n\nI was tired and the street was pretty empty and boring, but I was too excited and scared to fall sleep.  Every time a car passed or someone walked down the sidewalk, I tensed.  I kept imagining a SUV or van pulling up behind me.  Men getting out and pulling me from my car, taking me somewhere like where they had Rachel to kill or torture me.  Half a dozen times I almost cranked up and drove away, but every time I would think of her alone in that room.  She had no one but me to help her, and I had to try.\n\nTwo hours later, a fat balding man parked and started heading for the building.  As soon as I saw he was able to unlock the door and enter, I opened my car door to go talk to him.  Then I stopped.  I needed to be smart.  I didn’t know where they were, but I was sure there were hidden cameras in the locker room and outside the building.  If I go running in there and confront that guy, they’ll know for sure that I’m up to something.\n\nSighing with frustration, I shut the door back and waited until his shift was over.  I considered tailing him like in the movies, but I was scared I would just lose him or he would call someone for help.  So I waited until he was walking back to his car after a six hour shift, hopefully far enough away that the cameras wouldn’t see.  And then I met the man I came to know as Charles Jefferies.\n\n**** \n\n“Hey…Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute?”   His back was to me and he just waved his hand absently without looking up.\n\n“Sorry, I don’t have any money.  Have a good…”  He froze as he glanced back at me while talking.  “Oh God.  No.  No.  You need to get out of here, kid.  We aren’t allowed to talk.”  I could tell he was scared, but I couldn’t risk letting him go yet, not after all this.  I stepped up and pushed the door back shut as he was trying to get into his car.\n\n“So you know who I am?”  I tried to not sound mean, but I could hear how mad I was in my voice.\n\nHe yanked at the door again, but I was still holding it, and I was stronger than he was.  After a second, weaker tug, he turned around, his face strained and tired-looking.  “Yeah, I know who you are.  You work here just like me.  And I’m telling you, we aren’t supposed to be talking.  We aren’t supposed to meet, ever.”\n\nI frowned.  “Mr. Solomon never told me that.  He never said it was one of the rules.”\n\nThe man shook his head.  “Mr. Solomon.  Yeah.  Well there are plenty of rules they don’t tell you.  I bet they didn’t tell you what you were going to be watching before you started, did they?”  When I just lowered my eyes, he went on.  “Yeah, me either.  I’ve been at this job for ten years.  I’ve seen other people come and go, usually because they broke one those rules they never mentioned.  The only reason I’m still here is because I keep my head down and my mouth shut.”  He wagged a finger at me.  “You should do the same, if it’s not already too late.”\n\nI felt my stomach curling into a cold knot.  “Too late?”\n\nThe man rubbed his face.  “Kid, do you think they don’t know we’re talking?  Do you think anything happens that they don’t know about?”  He looked back toward the building, a look of sadness and fear in his eyes.  “Hell, for all I know, you’ve already killed us both.”  Shaking his head, he pushed me back and started opening the door.  “Either way, I’m done risking it.  You need to stop asking questions and just do your job.  It’s a lot healthier.”\n\nWith that, he got into his car and shut the door.  I didn’t try to stop him this time.  Even though I had already been worried about what he was telling me, hearing it confirmed was paralyzing.  What exactly was my plan?  He probably didn’t know any more than I did, and even if he did, what could I do with anything he told me?\n\nI walked back to my car with a heavy heart.  I was still afraid, but more than that, I was sad and ashamed.  I wanted to help Rachel, but I wasn’t sure how.  I wasn’t giving up, but as I drove back to my apartment, I couldn’t think of what I should do next.  This wasn’t a movie.  I wasn’t a hero.  And the only ideas I had left were to either go to the police, who might be controlled by whoever I worked for, or try to get proof of her being held prisoner myself.\n\nAs I parked my car and walked into my apartment building, I made a decision.  Unless I thought of something better overnight, I would do both ideas.  Tomorrow I would break the rule about carrying anything in.  I’d use my phone to record a video of the surveillance room, of Rachel and how she was trapped somewhere, and of me telling everything else I knew.  And I would email it to every newspaper, website, and internet channel I could think of.  I’d then go to the police and give them a copy too if I could make it that long without getting caught.  Maybe if I did all that, even if they got me, someone would help Rachel.\n\nI was filled with worry and dread at the idea of being hurt or killed.  A part of me kept saying I should just do as I was told and hope that it all went away.  But I couldn’t live with myself if I did that.  Even if I messed up, I felt like I had to try.  I was so preoccupied that I didn’t hear the person coming up behind me as I unlocked my apartment door.\n\n“Thomas?”\n\nI turned around and felt my legs weaken as I stumbled back against my door.  I had to be dreaming or crazy.  I grabbed the door knob for support as I looked at the woman in front of me.  It couldn’t be her, but somehow it was.\n\n[“Rachel?”](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)"},"251":{"title":"They paid me $5000 to go through hell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fjma9t\/they_paid_me_5000_to_go_through_hell\/","flair":null,"author":"Jaksim","selftext":"It was the advertisement’s outright simplicity that caught my attention.\n\n“Revolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!”\n\nI wish I could say I didn’t know why I called them. I wish I could say it was some act of God or deception that drove me into their waiting arms. But that would be a lie. The truth is I called them because I needed the money. Because I had gotten laid off at the publishing company I worked at and I was having trouble finding steady work. Because I was months behind on rent and facing my second eviction notice. Because I didn’t want to be a failure.\n\nI called them for selfish reasons.\n\nWho are they? I’m not exactly sure. In retrospect, their obvious obfuscation of their identity should have been a red flag to me. But at the time, their request seemed too interesting, their reward too vital, for me to risk losing the chance to help them. My best guess is that they’re a group of private researchers that are funded by some super-corporation. They must be. Otherwise, there was no way they would have been able to pay for the machine.\nThey showed me the machine the first time I met with them. It was kept in a cavernous room in the basement of a five-story office building. It was a work in progress at that time – they were still connecting pipes and soldering wires. But even in an unfinished state, it looked truly magnificent.\n\n“Have you ever heard of a sensory deprivation chamber?”\n\nI had. In fact, I had actually been inside one before, when I was in college. Back then, I was on a real hippy-dippy spiritual journey. You know, meditating a lot, experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Primarily magic mushrooms. At some point along that journey, I felt motivated to spend an hour of my life (and sixty dollars of my student loans) inside a sensory deprivation chamber at a local spa.\nYour standard sensory deprivation chamber is a large metal tank filled with about a foot of salt water. You step in and float in the water, then someone (a spa attendant, in my case) closes off the tank so it’s completely dark. With your vision obscured and your body suspended in the water, it’s supposed to feel like you no longer have your two primary senses. Depending on who you ask, this is supposed to be relaxing, enhance your creative process, allow you to reach higher consciousness, hallucinate, or maybe gain magic powers.\n\nMy experience with the chamber in college was fairly lackluster. I remember that the water was too frigid and the salt made my skin itch. It was difficult to concentrate on meditating or channeling my inner chakra or whatever the spa had promised. Truthfully, I did always wonder what it would have been like to get in one of those things while tripping on some magic mushrooms, but I never had the opportunity.\nThis sensory deprivation chamber didn’t look anything like the one I used in college. This chamber looked like a vivisected suit of medieval armor strewn across a large metal table. Thousands of tubes and wires connected to the metal body, which was about three times larger than my own body. The head or “helmet” of the chamber was collosal and round with a big brass pipe running out of its crown into the tiled-floor beneath it. On the walls surrounding the chamber were fifty or sixty computer screens, twenty or so server boxes, and various iterations of medical equipment that I couldn’t name if I tried. \n\nIt dawns on me now that the utility bills and computers alone for the machine must have been many tens of times higher than the measly $5000 they offered me, not to mention the salaries of the dozens of labcoat-clad scientists manning those computer screens. Again, perhaps this should have raised alarm bells, but I ignored it with the focused ignorance of a man who was on the brink of homelessness.\nThe man who showed me the machine told me his name was Dr. Monason. He was a wrinkled, balding man with a clean shave and focused eyes of blue. When I saw him, he was always clad in blue scrubs and a clean white labcoat. \n\nDr. Monason was the primary liaison for my involvement on this project. He explained the machine’s purpose, brought me the necessary waivers, and answered all my questions.\n\nQuestions like, “So what exactly am I supposed to do?”\n\n“We want you to remain in our sensory deprivation chamber for three days.”\n\nI’m sure my expression betrayed my sense of shock. \n\n“Three days? Is that – I mean will – Will that kill me?”\n\n“You probably would still be alive after three days in pure isolation, though you would likely become gravely ill and suffering from immense dehydration. Regardless, the machine will hydrate, feed, and otherwise sustain you during the experiment. So there is no risk of bodily harm.”\n\nDr. Monason went on to explain how the machine worked.\n\n“In your standard deprivation chamber, the occupant is deprived of their sense of sight, feeling, and, to a lesser extent, hearing. This deprivation, this process of shutting the outside world out from the occupant’s mind, decreases the burden on their brain. Thus, the occupant’s mind is free to wander more freely – free to think more creatively, to undergo a deeper state of thinking, to meditate, and so on.\n\n“But there is a problem with standard sensory deprivation chambers. Although the brain is freed from most external stimuli, the visual and auditory, the brain will continue to be burdened by internal stimuli. That is to say that the brain is still very aware of its own carrier – the human body. The brain will still react to the hunger and thirst of the vessel that carries it. It will still process both the need to and the action of urination and defecation. These internal interruptions go on and on, but the point is that standard sensory deprivation chambers cannot truly be said to deprive the occupant of their senses.\n\n“This machine is not your standard sensory deprivation chamber.”\n\nEven a cursory glance at the machine made clear what the doctor meant. \n\n“The inside of the exoskeleton portion of the machine is lined with a soft rubber that will acclimate to maintain the exact temperature of human skin. The tubes and wires control and regulate a wide variety of bodily functions. Through these tubes, the body is automatically fed and hydrated. The unsavory functions of the body are handled with a catheter and another series of tubes. A respirator automates breathing and regulates saliva production.\n\n“Even the body’s natural sense of touch is completely removed while in the machine. This IV cord injects a numbing solution into the bloodstream that completely shuts off all feeling. The numbing agent is the most critical asset of our sensory deprivation process.”\n\nThe list went on and on. It became clear that they had truly accounted for everything.\n\nEven for me. I was one of hundreds of applicants to be part of the experiment. For the first time in my life, I was the first round draft pick. The scientists explained to me that I had been chosen for three reasons.\n\nNumber one: I had no prior history of mental or physical illness that would make my experience in the chamber subject to “intervening variables.” Their words, not mine.\n\nNumber two: My height and weight were close matches for the machine’s original shape. \n\n“Although the legs will have to be lengthened ever so slightly, you are by far the closest match to our initial design.”\n\nAnd number three, the most critical: There was nothing happening outside of that chamber that would lead to an early termination of the experiment. I had no significant other, no job, no living family members – not even a houseplant to take care of. They could breathe easy knowing that I would remain peacefully within their contraption for the entire length of the experiment.\n\nNumber three was important to the scientists. They had specifically designed the machine to allow for three full days of isolation. If the machine’s process had to be interrupted early, it would take them a month to reset the machine and run the experiment again. \n\nUnfortunately, reason number three also meant there was nobody to come looking for me.\n\nThe intake process was long and detailed. I signed what felt like hundreds of liability waivers. I listened to warning after warning about the potential side effects.\n\n“Although it is apparent that you have a clean bill of health, you should be aware the isolation process may be taxing on you. Our preliminary research suggests that disassociation, audio and visual hallucinations, depression, time dilation, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other neuroses are potential effects. However, we believe such effects to be unlikely.”\n\nThey had given me several weeks to prepare for the experiment. My only requirement during that time was that I didn’t substantially change my bodyweight or somehow develop bipolar disorder. Somehow, I managed. I spent those few weeks living normally – watching movies, applying for jobs, getting rejected for those jobs, and reading a few books.\n\nWhen the day came, I was nervous despite Dr. Monason’s efforts to prepare me.\n\n“The process will come in stages. At first, you may endure a mild state of stress. We anticipate that soon after, you will drift into a moderate state of euphoria for the remainder of the process. You will be signaled a few minutes before the experiment is over by a short audio queue. This way, you will emerge from your state of sensory deprivation slowly and be able to re-acclimate without any risk of shock.”\n\nHe played the audio queue for me, which was a short musical clip of bells ringing. \nThen, with little ceremony or deliberation, I was asked to asked to remove my clothing and climb inside the machine.\n\nAs I lay down inside the exoskeleton, I felt the warm rubber against my bare skin. Even with the chamber still open, I was confined on all sides by the metal shell of the machine. Slowly, the researchers began to attach a score of medical devices to my body. I felt strangely calm through every prick of an IV and uncomfortable insertion of a tube.\nBut, as a respirator was placed on my face, I began to feel a foreboding sense of unease. As I felt my body being constricted and held in place a single thought filled my mind.\n\nOh God what have I done.\n\nThe researchers pushed the helmet of the exoskeleton inward on either side of my head, sealing off my ears. The world went quiet. A bead of sweat began to trickle down my sides. Then I heard a voice, seemingly broadcast from inside my own head.\n“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. Your vital signs indicate that you are beginning to panic. This is to be expected. Please do your best to relax while we finish preparing you. I promise that the process will become pleasurable soon enough.”\n\nSomehow telling me to relax just made me more anxious. Before I could react, I felt the machine close around my body. Already the numbing agent that was being piped into my bloodstream was starting to take away control of my extremities. I tried to push against the machine but found that my arms wouldn’t budge. I tried to scream but the respirator held my tongue firmly in place. I was unable to move, unable to do anything.\n\nExcept watch.\n\nI could still watch as researchers scrambled around me to check vitals and prepare the exoskeleton to finish closing. I could still watch as a giant analog timer appeared on a tv screen above me and began to broadcast a time.\n\n00:00:01:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nI tried again to scream. I tried again to plead to be let out. I found myself unable to feel any part of my body. I strained my eyes to try and get someone’s attention but no one seemed to be looking at me.\n\n00:00:00:30 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nHad my tear ducts been operating, I would have begun crying.  Without nothing else to do, I began to pray that this was a bad dream. To pray that I was home in bed and not in this chamber.\n\n00:00:00:05 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nThe last thing I saw was the face of Dr. Monason leaning over me. Waving to me. Saying something I couldn’t quite understand. Closing the exoskeleton’s face over my own.\n\n00:00:00:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nAnd then everything went dark.\n\n\nIf I had been in control of my own breathing, I would have begun hyperventilating immediately. \n\nI had never felt such a profound sense of darkness as in that moment. Unable to see even my own body, it was as if I had been extinguished from existence. My eyes swam in every direction in search of a single iota of light but found none.\n\nAfter a moment’s consideration, I realized that I had now been in the machine for some time. I had no reference point for exactly how long. Without outside stimuli of any kind, my only mechanism of telling time was by counting individual seconds in my head.\n\nYet time ticked on. I found myself alternating between obsessing about my imprisonment and finding myself adrift in my thoughts. \n\nI began to consider the state of my life. My recent unemployment. My lack of close friends. I felt a wave of depression come over me. Was my life really so meaningless that I could be snuffed out of existence for three days and no one could possibly care?\n\nI pondered the source of my isolation. I looked back to times I could have tried harder at my job. Images of friendships that I had let fall apart out of introversion and stagnation cascaded through my mind. \nAnd then I came across a thought in my head that, were my body not numbed to the point of immobility, would have made me burst out into laughter.\n\nI felt lonely.\n\nWell, of course, I felt lonely. I was, at that moment, the most alone human being there had ever been. Surely there were researchers only a few feet from my terrestrial body, but my mind had been isolated completely. I was as alone as someone could be.\n\nI let my mind continue to wander. It felt as though I had been in the chamber for hours at this point. Although I had planned to spend this time planning some sort of creative endeavor – the great American novel, perhaps – I found my mind repeatedly coming back to my current predicament. \n\nObsessively, I thought about my body and the container that currently housed it. The numbing medicine must have been truly quite something. I couldn’t feel the slightest wisp of breath passing through my nasal cavities or the rumble of my stomach.\n\nIt was then that a pair of intertwining thoughts collided in my mind.\n\nA: Could I be dead?\n\nB: No, of course not. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI knew how I had ended up here – I knew that I had signed up to engage in an experiment that would put me in this exact predicament. But I must admit, I no longer felt very alive. Without my body or the surrounding world as a reference point, it felt as though I had no assurance that I still existed. My thoughts began dueling with one another.\n\nA: Surely I’m not dead. This is exactly what the experiment was supposed to do.\n\nB: If you’re not dead then why can’t you feel anything? Why can’t you feel your breath or saliva or ANYTHING?\n\nA: But I know I’m not dead because I’m thinking right now.\n\nB: What does that mean?\n\nA: You know? I think, therefore I am.\n\nI think, therefore I am. A smarter man could have told you who said that. But I was left with just that proclamation, from an unknown source, as the only assurance that I was alive. As long as I was thinking, I was still alive.\n\nI began to picture myself floating through a void in space. The image was clear in front of my eyes. My body lay flat, my arms stiff, as I rocketed past stars and unfamiliar planets. I watched my body weave past asteroids and through planetary rings. I felt the warmth of the sun on my body and the cold ice of the frozen planets on my skin.\n\nExcept I didn’t really feel those things. I had to remind myself of that. I was starting to imagine feelings that weren’t really there. I wasn’t sure how much I should try to avoid these feelings or just embrace them for the duration of the experiment. Just another question to ponder, I suppose.\n\nThere came a time when I realized that I had been in sensory deprivation for a long time. Since I had not been counting, it was impossible to know how long. It felt like it had been days already.\n\nHad it been days already?\n\nThat was a worrying thought. In a timeless void, three days stretched on like an endless millennium. \n\nThey had assured me that I would only be inside the machine for three days. But how could I know for sure? Once I was inside, I had no way of getting out. They could keep me for as long as they wanted to. Maybe that was their plan all along. \n\nA: How could they get away with that? \n\nB: Who knows what all those liability waivers I signed said. I stopped reading them after the third or fourth one. Maybe I agreed to this. \n\nA: You’re being crazy.\n\nB: I don’t know if I’m being crazy or not. I don’t know how long I’ve been in here.\n\nA: So count!\n\nThat was right. I had one way to tell how long I had been inside the machine. Counting.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nFive.\n\nAnd on and on. I counted to 60. That was a minute. And then I counted another minute. And another and another and another. I just kept going and going. I never lost focus on the task at hand.\nThen I hit 1000 minutes. Technically, 1000 minutes was only a little more than 16 and a half hours. Certainly not the three-day period I was supposed to be inside the machine. \n\nBut that was 16 and a half hours on top of all the time I had already spent thinking about my life and dreaming about floating through space. Surely I had spent longer thinking to myself than I had counting.\n\nI tried to guess how long I had been in the machine. It felt like it had been more than three days. I just kept trying to tell myself that I would be let out of the machine soon.\n\nI let my mind drift off again. \n\nMy body was once again floating through space. I watched it drift farther and farther out into an endless void of darkness. The planets and suns shrunk into oblivion until I was truly, deeply alone. \nIn the black abyss, a creeping feeling of cold began to set in. Its biting sting spread up my legs and torso to my face. My naked skin turned a pale blue and begun to harden into a crystalline husk. As my body drifted farther into darkness, I watched the surface of my stomach crack and chip. \n\nSlowly, chunks of my body began to break off and float into the darkness. With each expelled scrap of flesh, a new wave of pain cascaded through my body. I found myself trying to grab onto my frozen body and put it back together, but my arms and legs were so cold that I could not budge. I tried to scream but my tongue had swelled so large that it filled my crumbling, frigid mouth.\nAll at once, my body exploded into an array of jagged, bloody shards of ice. The pain was indescribable.\n\nThen I was, again, alone in the darkness. Bodiless. Without lungs to expel the panicked breaths I was so desperate to create. I had to keep telling myself – it wasn’t real. I’m still alive. My body is still here, somewhere.\n\nA: But god, didn’t it feel real?\n\nB: But it wasn’t real.\n\nA: Real or not, didn’t it hurt?\n\nB: Yes.\n\nA: Are you scared?\n\nB: Yes.\n\n. . .\n\nA: Wait. Do you hear that?\n\nI listened through ears that were a million miles away. A voice – not mine own – burst into my head. Its bristly accent was familiar.\n\n“Hello! This is Dr. Monason. I’m contacting you again via the small speakers contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. I am proud to announce that you have successfully completed three days within the machine.”\n\nI felt my alarm melt quickly into relief. I tried to smile, to little avail.\n\n“At this juncture, we would like to update you as to the status of our experiment. The data we’re getting from your brain scans is proving incredibly useful. The medical implications are numerous. We have contacted our institutional review board and obtained permission to extend the experiment indefinitely. This is, of course, in accordance with the liability waivers that you’ve signed previously. The machine should be able to keep you alive for a few more weeks until your body becomes unable to support it any further. Do not worry, $5000 will nonetheless be credited into your account. Thank you for your contribution. Your sacrifice will save lives.”\n\nI tried to scream. I tried to flail my arms in protest and push back against the doctor’s words but my screams were silent and my arms no longer part of me.\n\nI felt a deep, echoing hole of dread grow inside me. Yet I would never truly feel anything again.\n\nI would die in this chamber. It would take days. And those days would feel like months. And those months would be torture. \n\nI again saw myself floating in an immeasurable darkness. There were no stars or planets. There was only my body. Unequivocally alone. Arguably alive, but inevitably dead.\n\nI stopped counting the seconds and just let myself float.\n\n--\n\nMy mind wandered again, this time for much longer. I dreamt of my childhood and of a future I would never get to lead. I made an imaginary bucket list and felt remorse for the boxes I had not yet checked. I held conversations in my head between old friends and lovers. \n\nAnd sometimes, I didn’t think at all. Sometimes I disappeared from existence altogether.\n\nBut then I felt it. I felt something. I couldn’t tell what it was at first. It had been so long since I felt something that I couldn’t tell if I was imagining it or not.\n\nIt was my big toe. My big toe on my right foot. Somehow, someway, it still had feeling. Not a lot of feeling – it felt like when you sit on your hand and it becomes almost, but not quite, numb. Like it was being massaged by a set of pins and needles.\n\nI moved the toe around, the little that I could, to try to understand how this feeling had come back.\n\nThen I felt it – a tiny prick. The slightest droplet of pain against my big toe. Something sharp.\n\nAn IV needle.\n\nIt must have become dislodged somehow. Maybe one of those labcoat-wearing schmucks tripped over it or something. All I knew was that I could feel again. I suddenly felt like I had been born again. Like I had died and risen from the ashes.\n\nThis needle must have been one of the needles that was supposed to deliver the numbing chemical into my body. Somehow, it got dislodged and now I had just a little feeling in my toe. Unfortunately, my big toe was hardly the vestige of my body most suited to orchestrate my grand escape. \n\nBut still, I felt immeasurable happiness. Because I had a secret weapon on my side. \n\nTime. There’s an old adage that goes “If you give a monkey a typewriter and infinite time, he will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare”. Similarly, with a partially numb big toe and infinite time to think, I could craft my grand escape.\n\nMy big toe was too weak to push open the exoskeleton. Despite my straining, I was unable to reach any other cords to pull them out. All I could reach was the IV needle that had already been pulled out.\nAnd with that IV needle, I hatched my plan. I scraped my toe across it. It stung, but I knew it would do the trick. I knew that I had forced those stupid scientists’ hands. My efforts had made a cut in my toe-skin. And now I knew I was going to be okay.\n\nThey only had two options. Let me bleed out, in which case I would at least be free from this hell, or let me out of the chamber, at least long enough to reattach the IV. Either way, my plan was foolproof. Either way, I was going to be free, at least for a moment.\n\nIt only took them a few minutes to notice what I had done.\n\n--\n\n“This is Dr. Monason again, communicating via the tiny speaker in the helmet of the exoskeleton. It seems you have managed to injure yourself inside the exoskeleton. After some discussion, we have elected to pause the experiment and correct the error. Stand by – the exoskeleton will be opening shortly.”\n\nThe light that soon flooded my eyes all but blinded me. As the machine opened, I bathed in the sounds of its electronic thunks and whirs and the conversation of the men around me. The quick tug as needles and tube were removed from me felt better than any touch I had ever experienced.\n\nThey let me out. I was free.\n\nMy body was numb for hours. The medicine prevented me from making any movements, at all. During that time, the scientists left me in the exoskeleton as they went over data and bandaged my big toe. I tried to listen to everything they were saying but found myself unable to concentrate. The bright lights above me burned my eyes, which had grown accustomed to perfect darkness.\n\nAs the drugs slowly left my body, a dull ache developed in my joints. After a while, my body was hauled out of the exoskeleton by a team of the labcoats. I felt a dressing gown slip on over my head. I was plopped into a wheelchair. Still unable to move, I listened to the roll of metal wheels as they pushed that chair deeper and deeper into their lab.\n\n--\n\n“Explain again about when you were floating through space. What was the sensation like?”\n\n“Please let me go!”\n\n “I can’t. You know that. The data we were getting from you is too important. Lives are at stake. And besides that, we can’t risk you going to the police. You will be going back in the machine.”\n\nThis conversation had been going on for about an hour in the tiny interrogation room set up somewhere in the research group’s massive underground lab. Although I had regained enough feeling to speak, I still found movement quite difficult. It was clear that as soon as I outlived my usefulness to the lab coats I was going to be placed back inside the machine until my bodily demise. The data that the scientists had gained so far was so useful that they had no problem holding me against my will.\n\nAs I sat in that tiny metal room, tied to cold folding chair, clad only in a thin dressing gown, I considered my fate. For $5000 I had sold away the rest of my life. My only respite now was that I could delay going back in the machine for as long as I resisted Dr. Monason’s questioning. But I knew I was just delaying the inevitable.\n\nI stared down at my big toe, now wrapped in a bandage. Somehow it had not dawned on me that, even if I got out of the machine, the scientists were unlikely to let me out of the building alive. Not after they decided to imprison me until I died, anyway.\n\n“What if I don’t answer the questions?”\n\n“The data we intend to receive from those questions is critical and could save lives. But if we cannot illicit it, then the information received from the exoskeleton will be sufficient. If you won’t answer, we will return you to the machine now.”\n\nSo it didn’t matter. I was already doomed. I might as well delay for as long as I could.\n\n“Fine. Ask me what you want to ask me.”\n\nI answered hundreds of questions, most of them multiple times. It took hours. The scientists barely listened to my words. There was a recorder placed in the room with me. I’m sure someone would dig through my answers later, but for now the conversation seemed to be mostly for posterity’s sake.\n\nAt some point though, I realized something. The drugs had completely left my body. I could, theoretically, move again. For now, I was tied to a chair. But they couldn’t keep me tied up if they wanted me to go back into the machine.\n\nAnd from that thought, I came up with a plan. I knew I would only have a few seconds. I knew I couldn’t run immediately, or they would catch me. I would have to convince them I was resigned to my fate.\nWhen the questioning concluded, I found myself being hauled back into the chamber containing the exoskeleton. Perhaps assuming that I would flee otherwise, the scientists kept me tied up during transit.\n\nBut the ties came off when it was time to put me in the machine. They stripped off my night gown and lifted me inside the machine. I let my body go limp as they did – feigning the same numbness that had, until recently, restricted my movement. As I laid down in the rubber interior of the exoskeleton, Dr. Monason spoke to me through a loudspeaker in the ceiling. \n\n“I am sorry we have to part again. Your answers will be invaluable for future research. I know it may seem now like we are villains. But the research we’re obtaining is invaluable. It will save lives someday. You are doing a valuable service to the world.”\n\nAs his speech ended, his researchers again approached to fill my body with needles and tubes. I was eager to make my escape but I held tight. They would have to believe I was unable to move.\n\nI felt pinpricks in my right arm. I was already being loaded up with the numbing agent. My time was going to be short. As some of the labcoats approached me on my left side to insert another IV, I launched myself upward so I was standing inside the machine. Surprised by my sudden motion, the scientists on my left recoiled. I felt a sharp pain in my right arm as the IVs and tubes held tight against the strain of my sudden motion.\n\nThe room exploded into panic. Men rushed at me from all sides. I felt my body moving as if on its own volition. My left arm reached towards my right and ripped a series of cords and needles out of my body. Blood sprayed onto the machine. My right arm fell loosely to my side.\n\nI propelled myself out of the machine and onto the floor, naked as the day I was born. The numbing agent had disabled my right arm, but most of my body was fine. I sprinted towards the door through which I had entered the lab, what now seemed like a millennium ago. I did not dare turn back to see if I was being chased. All I could do was run.\n\nAs I pushed the door open, I saw a long hallway that led to a set of alternating staircases. Staircases that I had walked up and down several times while preparing for the experiment. Stairs that I had always assumed I would one day walk up for the last time. \n\nI pushed my body as hard as I could. I ran with my right arm dangling limp beside me until I reached the stairs. Behind me, the angered yells of men and the thud of their footsteps remained consistent. I knew that if they caught me, it was game over. \n\nWhen I reached the stairs, I practically jumped up the entire first flight. As I turned to climb the next flight, I saw that only two men had kept pace with me. Suddenly, I was filled with hope. Perhaps I could outrun them all. Then I would go to the police and get the chance to put this whole operation under the microscope. As soon as I got to the top of that second flight of stairs and through the exit doors, I would be free.\n\nMy hopes were dashed as soon as I reached the top of the stairs. At least fifteen men guarded the building’s exit. Clearly my escape had been a contingency for which the facility was prepared. As the men approached behind me and in front of me, I knew there was only one way I could go.\n\nThe alternating staircases continued past the first floor. All the way up to the roof.\n\nI kept running. Staircase after staircase. My aching body protesting each step. My dead arm banging against stair railings and walls as I made my way up those stairs. The sounds of angry men filling my ears as I took step after step after step.\n\nSoon I was on the last staircase. A ladder, hanging from the ceiling, led up to a hatch on the roof of the building. This was it. I was going to see the outside world again. I didn’t know where I was going to go once I got up there, but I knew I was free.\n\nI jumped onto the ladder and pulled myself up, about six feet into the air. When I reached the top I pushed on the hatch. It was heavy and barely budged. I strained against the hatch for a moment, then felt a tight grip on my ankle.\n\nOne of the men had caught up. He had wrapped his cold hand around my leg and was beginning to yank me off the ladder. I turned slightly and saw it was Dr. Monason. His eyes were red and as large as saucers. It was like looking into the eyes of the devil himself. \n\nI reacted purely out of instinct. My grip on the ladder tightened and I swung my free foot at the doctor’s face. As my heel collided with his jaw, sending teeth and blood flying in all directions, I couldn’t help but smile at the feeling. It hurt like you wouldn’t believe, but it felt damned good to feel something. \n\nDr. Monason relaxed his grip. I pushed upwards again and the hatch gave way. I clambered upwards onto the flat roof of the building. A thin layer of gravel covered the rooftop. The sharp stones poked at my bare feet, but I kept moving. I ran to the edge of the roof and looked out into the city. \n\nA beautiful horizon of skyscrapers and stars filled my view. I felt the cold breeze against my bare skin. The voices of the men behind me barely registered as I climbed onto the edge of the roof.\nI must have been a sight to the people walking by on the sidewalk below. A naked man standing on the edge of a building staring at the horizon as if he had never seen one before. \n\n“Please come down from there. You don’t have to go back in the machine. We just need you to come down.” \n\nIt was Dr. Monason again. His voice was hard to understand now that he was short a few teeth. I turned away from the horizon to look at him. He was surrounded on all sides by other men in labcoats.\n\nI knew at that moment that I had no real choices left. Could I believe Dr. Monason that he wouldn’t put me back in the machine? Probably not. But I had no chance to escape at this point. There were too many of them for me to get away.\n\nJust as one of the researchers reached out to grab me, I took a step backward.\n\nAs my body tumbled down to the earth below, I found myself laughing. It was just like when I was in the machine. My body was floating once again. The cold air numbed my body and, once again, I couldn’t feel a thing. \n\nJust before I struck the ground, I heard the sound of church bells ringing out. Hallelujah. I figured I must be on my way to heaven.\n\n--\n\nNo heaven came. Instead, I found myself in complete darkness. Feeling nothing, seeing nothing, simply ruminating on my previous actions. \n\nIs this what death is like?\n\nIn answer to my question, I heard a familiar voice.\n\n“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you once again via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. You have successfully completed your three days within the exoskeleton.”\n\nHad I not still been pumped full of numbing drugs, I would have wept. \n\n“We are currently in the process of opening the machine. At that point, we will perform a physical assessment. I’m sure you are anxious to leave. I can assure you we will move as quickly as possible to make that happen. Thank you so much for your assistance with this project. It has been invaluable.”\n\nThree days. I had been in that machine for exactly three days. \n\nIt didn’t click for me until they were pulling me out of the machine. There was no bandage on my big toe, no needle near my foot on which I could have cut myself. \n\nThe facility was nothing but accommodating in the hours after the experiment terminated. They provided me with a comfortable place to rest while the remainder of the drugs left my system. Although they asked questions about my experience, they were not hostile when I refused to speak. The researchers were happy to answer my questions about the experience. Happy to tell me it was all in my head.\n\nIn the days following the experiment, Dr. Monason made sure that I was provided with any mental health resources that I requested. He connected me with a therapist that I have been seeing for several weeks. The therapist has prescribed me an antidepressant, which I take twice a day. I have returned to my normal life. My rent is paid. I’m seeing someone new. I got a new job at another book publishing company. \n\nIt’s like all my fantasies have come true.\n\nBut no matter how long I talk to the therapist and no matter how many pills I take, I can’t get the machine out of my head. I can’t stop thinking about how those three days seemed to extend indefinitely.\n\nA: But you’re out of the machine. Your three days are up!\n\nB: Yes, but…\n\nA: But what?\n\nB: I was out of the machine once before. \n\nA: But that wasn’t real.\n\nB: But it felt real. \n\nA: Does this feel real?\n\nB: . . . I don’t know anymore.\n\nCould three days feel . . . even longer? Could I imagine a therapist, a job, a better life?  I don’t know.\n\nSometimes I close my eyes and I become too afraid to open them, because I’m worried that when I do, I will see only darkness. I’m scared I will find myself still floating, motionless, amongst those imaginary stars. \n\n\n [J.L.](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jlaughlinhorror)"},"252":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Looking at it. At her.\n\nPrudence had a facial expression filled with guilt and now I knew the truth I could see it. The creature was exactly how Ian had described, except with wavy ginger hair and a sadness in its beady eyes. \n\nThis abomination was Lyla. This was how Prudence had bought her back, and this was the only way I would ever see Jamie again, a risk I wasn’t going to take. After days of disbelief the reality finally hit me like a ton of bricks. Jamie was dead and he wasn’t coming back.\n\n“Why did you do this?” I asked, my voice shaking with horror.\n\nPrudence scowled at me, trying to mask her shame.\n\n“I didn’t want this. If you think this was my aim then you’re sicker than I am. I just wanted my granddaughter back. \n\nWhen she died a part of me died. My son blamed me, his wife blamed me and although he never said it, I could see in Bernie’s eyes that he did too. \n\nI’d pushed for her to stay, I wanted to spend more time with her. I got cocky about my ability to cope with the strange occurrences in the flats. I know what you must be thinking. But I swear I didn’t know about the sleepwalking until it was too late.\n\nWe had moved into the flat not long after my son left home to move in with his girlfriend. He’s the youngest of three and was the last to fly the nest, so we downsized for the two of us. He never knew what we were facing in that flat, or the dangers that he sent his little girl into. \n\nWhen it happened it was a few years after the fire and the troubles with the creatures. We’d struck the deal with the things in the lift and the neighbours of the burned flats had become a fixture just like the other quirks. I really thought she would be safe.”\n\nPrudence paused to gaze longingly at the mutated little girl in the cage, the creature just twitched. In return it barred its 4 rows of teeth and made a gentle hiss.\n\n“But how did you do this!?” I stopped her with more urgency this time, looking at rat-Lyla in disbelief. I had to get answers out of her fast. I didn’t want to spend anymore time than was absolutely necessary in this shed. \n\n“The gardener helped me.” She answered, her voice trembling. \n\n“Who the fuck is the gardener?” I grew more impatient with every new confusion she threw at me. The last thing I needed was something new and potentially malevolent in the mix. \n\n“I didn’t mention him in my note because he’s been gone for over 20 years, he’ll be of no concern to you so don’t worry. His damage is in the past now...\n\nAround the time Lyla went missing the council granted planning permission for the tower block next door. But before that was built the land it sits on acted as a communal garden for ours and the neighbouring tower block on the other side. It had a regular gardener named Derek who you would often see tending the flowerbeds out front. \n\nDerek was one of the first people I met when I moved in.\n\nLike I said, I had to work it all out myself and the first time the window cleaner came to the balcony I naturally reached to let him in and offer a cup of tea.\n\nAs my hand applied pressure to the handle to open the balcony door, there was a knock at the front door. I made a gesture to the cleaner to indicate that I would only be a minute and answered. \n\nThere was Derek. He stopped me and told me not to let the man in, that I would be making a huge mistake.\n\nI thought he sounded crazy, and I told him so, after a while of arguing I got up to reboil the kettle and let the man in and Derek grabbed my hands and shouted at me to look at the man outside.\n\nWhen I turned to look, there was no man outside, but a monster. He was tall and impossibly thin, flesh and bones but somehow thinner than bones with greying skin stretched over them. He had eyes that seemed to be so deep set they went on forever, like the blackest cave you can imagine. Saliva dripped from his mouth and landed on my balcony floor, some sliding down the glass panel of the door. \n\nI opened my mouth to scream, but as I did, Derek let go of my hands and the monster was gone. In its place was that smug, friendly man, begging for a drink while he cleans the windows. \n\nIt took me a minute to process it, but I know what I’d seen. That was the real window cleaner. I never intentionally opened or tried to open the door for him again. \n\nThat day Derek didn’t stay long. He didn’t tell me what the window cleaner is, or why he visits every few days. He didn’t explain anything about the weird things that go on. As much as Derek was a part of the strange happenings he was like one that had been carved from light.\n\nHe said that he’d always be around when I needed him, that it was his job to look after the residents just like the flowerbeds. \n\nOver the years he appeared a few times. He was instrumental in striking a deal with the creatures. When the neighbours died in the fire he created a special display for them in the garden, and made sure that nothing planted was poisonous to the cats as soon as they arrived. He also stopped an imposter from killing Bernie at our front door.\n\nHe seemed like such a good thing for the residents. Always there to help. Offer some gentle advice or a creative solution. Someone to be trusted.\n\nHe changed when they granted planning permission for the other block though. He knew his garden would be dug up to lay foundations and his uses redundant. He became grumpy and bitter over time but no one payed enough attention to notice. Especially not when my tragedy struck.\n\nWhen Lyla died I was devastated. Derek appeared to me as I sat on a bench in the garden crying. He offered to help me, to use the garden to get her back. I snapped at him. I told him it was his fault and that he should have been there when it happened to stop them. \n\nHe worked so hard on the agreement with the creatures, he spent a lot of time with them. Lyla broke the rule and he had to allow them to do what had been agreed, he said. He couldn’t have stopped them. But he wanted to help make things right. \n\nI understood why he hadn’t intervened. But I couldn’t accept it, I lashed out at him. I’m embarrassed to say I actually slapped the poor man along with stamping on his freshly planted flowerbed. I was angry and grieving. \n\nI quickly burned myself out and collapsed into a blubbering heap on the floor. Derek attempted to comfort me but his mind was on his garden.\n\nHe said he was sorry for my loss but I shouldn’t have attacked the flowerbed. That he’d always been nice to me and I should be kinder in return.\n\nI snapped and told him that it didn’t matter because it was all about to be bulldozed in the next few days anyway.\n\nI should have taken more note of the way he twitched as I said that. He snapped.\n\nHe said that he knew I was angry. But there was no need to take it out on him, if I was that desperate to get Lyla back he knew a way. But it was dangerous. \n\nI begged. Anything I said. I would do anything. \n\nHe told me it was simple and that all I had to do was enter the lift and offer the creatures some food whilst repeating the phrase *revertetur mortuis* during their frenzied hours. \n\nHe said that there was no guarantee they wouldn’t be crunching on my bones before I even got the first word out but that if I succeeded I would have Lyla back. \n\nOf course, it was successful. There wasn’t a creature in sight as I performed the ritual as instructed. \n\nI thought nothing happened at first. She didn’t appear straight away, but a few days later I found her running round inside my house, she’d taken a chunk out of Damon’s ear with her teeth. I tried to kill her at first, but just as I was about to finalise it I saw in her eyes who she was. \n\nI tried to look for Derek but by that point the workmen had started. Nothing was left of his garden, and nothing was left of Derek. No one’s seen him since. You see, Kat, nothing in that building is totally harmless. You have to be on your guard at all times.\n\nI’ve kept her like this ever since. You may think I’m crazy but I couldn’t kill my own granddaughter. I’m not a monster.”\n\nPrue sighed and ushered me back out of the shed, she locked the door behind us, closing the padlock on her most hideous secret. \n\nI was exhausted. It was a lot of information to take in and as a result of the information I’d received, real grief for my boyfriend was finally settling in. Every hope I had was dashed. I know many of you tried to tell me in the comments that he was gone but I wanted you to be wrong so bad. \n\nI couldn’t bear to look at Prudence Hemmings for another moment. I made my excuses and left, morosely riding the bus back to the tower block I had once been so excited to live in. \n\nIt was mid afternoon by time I got home. The choice between the stairs and lift didn’t strike much enthusiasm into me but I opted for the stairs, and after what I’m sure ended up being 11 flights, I made it the 6 flights up the stairs to my flat. \n\nI laid on our mattress on the floor and sobbed for Jamie. I sobbed so hard my throat went dry and hurt and my stomach cramped with each gasping breath. I sobbed myself to sleep. My body and mind must have given up fighting the need to rest and shut down.\n\nWhen I woke up it was late, about 10pm. I wrote as much of my update as I could for you guys, hit post and just sat at the dining table with my head in my hands. \n\nMy whole life had fallen to shit and I knew it. \n\nI thought about so many things, questioned why they were happening to me. I searched social media for updates on Georgia but there were none. Jamie wasn’t super close with his family but I knew it wasn’t long before they’d start to worry. Everything I considered just snowballed in my mind.\n\nThe loneliness in dealing with this situation was killing me. \n\nI decided to do something I usually wouldn’t. I went downstairs and I knocked on the door of flat 26. \n\nTerri answered. Her perfectly bobbed hair was a little unkempt and out of place, she had huge bags under her eyes and I could smell wine on her breath. \n\n“Are you ok Kat?” She looked concerned. I found it ironic that she looked so disheveled I had forgotten it was me who came for help.\n\n“I’m not... I’m sorry... I know I don’t know you ..I ... just...” I could barely speak.\n\n“Don’t worry. Prue called me. She told me everything. I’m sorry about your boyfriend, it’s a shame I never got to meet him.” Terri stared back at me with the same expression a mother would, warm and understanding. “Would you like a cup of tea, maybe something stronger?”\n\n“I’d love a coffee please.” I answered meekly, making way way into the living room, her sofa was comfy, it reminded me of being back home at my parents before any of this started. \n\nTerri trotted out to the kitchen, stumbling slightly. I could see the kitchen counter from the sofa, and the empty bottle of wine that accounted for her stumbling. \n\nAs she boiled the kettle there was a huge crash from somewhere inside the flat. I jumped, feeling startled. Terri coughed in a meagre attempt to conceal the noise.\n\n“Excuse me for just a moment please.” She muttered apprehensively as she walked out of the living area and into the hallway containing the bedrooms. \n\nI heard another crash, giggling and some inaudible shouting. After a while things went quiet and Terri came back into the living room. \n\n“Sorry about that, kids you know.” She announced, brushing off the noises. I’d almost forgotten about Eddie and Ellie. It was late already and by the resigned expression on Terri’s face indicated that this was how all her nights began. \n\nI nodded. I couldn’t muster up much more of a response. I think she could see that I just needed to sit there. She got up to finish making and then set the cup of tea in front of me with 2 digestive biscuits. I hadn’t eaten properly in days and I really needed the sugar. \n\nIt turned out me and Terri get along really well. We have similar taste in movies, music and food despite the age gap. We spoke for about an hour about random, normal stuff. It was nice to get a break from the madness. I got used to the crashing around from the twins. I even laughed a few times. I’d forgotten what that felt like these past few days.\n\nThe break didn’t last long. The next noise that we heard was louder than the first. It was quickly followed by two small children, running into the living room diving into their mothers arms. \n\nI was taken aback for a moment. Eddie and Ellie were dressed in pyjamas, and were still the cute children that I had met in the hallway, but something was different. Their brown puppy dog eyes had become deep voids, like what I’d imagined when Prue described the window cleaners true form. And at the ends of their fingers were long sharp claws protruding from where nails should be. \n\nI didn’t have time to recoil in terror at their new looks, Terri clutched them and asked what was wrong. They wailed and buried the voids where their eyes should be into their mothers shoulders. Despite their terrifying exterior, these were two very scared little kids. \n\nIt had been a very long day and I thought my nightmare was over but it was only just beginning. Ellie mumbled into Terri’s shoulder, in that high pitched voice kids do when they’re scared.\n\n“Mummy, were sorry, we didn’t mean to let them in. We were just teasing...”\n\n“Shhh they’re coming!” Hissed Eddie, in the same distressed high pitched tone. \n\n“Who’s... what have you done?” Terri asked, colour drained from her face.\n\nThe kids didn’t get a chance to reply. Terri’s face turned paler than I thought possible. I looked up and standing in the living room doorway were about 10 people, all incredibly average looking. \n\nThey were almost expressionless, they didn’t look angry or pleased to see us. They were dressed in non descriptive clothes. I imagined trying to describe them to one of those artists that draws pictures for the police and I genuinely don’t think even one of them had a distinguishing feature. \n\nThat’s why it took me a while to spot her in the crowd, even though she had been glaring at me the entire time. \n\nNatalia.\n\nHow our confrontation went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjzfky\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"253":{"title":"My job is to watch a woman trapped in a room.

I like it.  My name is actually Melanie though.”\n\nI felt my face reddening.  Of course her name wasn’t actually Rachel.  That was just something I made up in my head.  Still, my embarrassment couldn’t keep up with my confusion and joy.  “Is it really you?”\n\nShe nodded.  “Yeah, it’s me.”\n\nRachel…Melanie grunted as I stepped forward and started hugging her.  Laughing, she hugged me back for a moment, but then she whispered in my ear.  “Thomas, we need to talk, and not out here.  Can we go inside?”\n\nI broke away and nodded, wiping at my eyes as I tried to finish unlocking the door with a shaking hand.  My heart was pounding and I still felt like I was in a strange and wonderful dream, but when we had gotten inside and sat down on my living room sofa, I forced myself to focus on the biggest question I had.\n\n“How?”\n\nMelanie had still been smiling as we sat down, but now she looked worried and sad.  “Thomas, that’s what I’m here to tell you.  Things aren’t like you think they are.  They never have been.”\n\nI frowned, a new line of fear cutting through my happy haze.  “What do you mean?”\n\nShe held the bridge of her nose for a moment, looking down like she was trying to figure out how to say…whatever it was she had to say.  “Thomas…you’re part of a psychological experiment.  I’ve been a part of it for longer than you have as one of the actors, and I still don’t know all the details.  I’m pretty sure it’s run by some government agency, and I know they’re investing a lot of money and time into it, but for what reasons…that I’m not so sure.”\n\nI realized I was wringing my hands.  No, that wasn’t right.  It couldn’t be right.  This was some kind of trick.\n\nMelanie went on.  “What I do know is that you’re being watched as a long-term subject.  They have constructed this whole scenario where you do a secret job watching someone…me…who looks like they might be trapped.  They give you instructions and a way of making choices.  You’ve got buttons or something you can choose between, right?”\n\nI nodded weakly, my tongue thick in my throat.  “Yeah.  A red one.   And a green one.”\n\nShe sighed and nodded.  “I think they’re testing how much you’ll obey.  What choices you’ll make based off of your morals, your intelligence, and your fear.  It’s interesting, or at least I thought so when I first joined up six years ago.  They’ve never officially given me many details, just the overall gist.  But people talk.  The other actors and me, sometimes we hear things, and we gossip.”  She smiled sadly.  “That’s what caused me to start feeling bad.”\n\nI interrupted.  “Other actors?”\n\nMelanie’s eyes widened.  “Oh shit, yeah.  Sorry.  I think they still call him Mr. Solomon?  And there are others too.”  When I just stared at her, she went on.  “Anyway, for a long time it was just the normal job, right?  I spend six hours a day acting like I’m this trapped girl, mainly faking painting or watching t.v.  You know, boring stuff…”\n\nI couldn’t help but interrupt again, hating the hurt trembling in my voice.  “You fake the painting?  You aren’t really painting those wonderful pictures?”\n\nNow Melanie looked embarassed.  “No, sorry.  I can’t paint a bit.  I’m a pretty good singer though.”  She tried to smile, but faltered.  Reaching forward, she touched my arm.  “That’s why they always have the paintings turned where you can’t see them.  They’re already done beforehand.  All you ever see is some blank canvases and…well, when they *want* me to show you something.”  Her expression darkened as she went on.\n\n“That’s why I had to break the rules and contact you.  When they started doing this hidden message, mind game bullshit, I got worried.  Worried you would take it too serious.  That you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself.  As soon as you left your shift tonight, I talked to one of the guys in the video department.  He told me about how you had reacted.  Showed me how you were still parked down the street from the building.  I drove over—the bedroom set is in a building outside of town.  I saw you sitting in your car, and I almost approached you then, but I was scared of getting caught and fired.  So I parked and waited until I could follow you somewhere else and let you know I was okay.”\n\nShe blinked back tears.  “I’m ashamed to say I almost left a couple of times.  I don’t want to lose this job, and I tried to tell myself you would be okay after a day or two.  I could get them to change the script enough that you felt like I was okay and wouldn’t worry too much.”\n\nI felt an angry heat growing in my chest.  “Well, that’s nice of you.”\n\nShe looked up, her eyes red.  “I know.  I’m a shit.  I’m so sorry.  I was being selfish and cowardly, but I didn’t actually leave.  And then when I saw Charlie leaving the building, saw you running over to talk to him, I knew they were escalating it even further.”\n\n“Charlie?”\n\nMelanie rolled her eyes in frustration.  “Shit, yeah.  Sorry.  Charlie Jefferies.  He’s another actor.  In an earlier version of the experiment he actually played Mr. Solomon, but they decided he wasn’t scary enough, so now he’s usually in one of the suits.  He’s actually done that for your version a lot, you just can’t recognize him under all that get-up they wear.”\n\nI kept curling and uncurling my hands on my lap.  It was all too much.  I felt like a pinball going between anger and relief and embarassment and confusion.  “So all that stuff he told me?  That was all just to scare me?  See how I’d react?”\n\nShe nodded as she sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.  “Yes.  I’m sorry.  That’s why I knew I couldn’t wait any longer to tell you.  I could see how worried and scared you were going back to your car.”\n\nI pulled my arm back from her touch.  “Well, thanks I guess.  At least you stopped me before I went to the police and looked like a joke in front of them too.”  I just wanted her gone, her sympathetic, pitying eyes off of me.  “Thanks for stopping by and letting me in on it.”  I tried to make my voice sound hard and unfeeling, but it came out watery instead.  Standing up, I turned away from her so she couldn’t see as I started to cry.  “If you don’t mind, I…uh…I need time to think about everything.  It’s…a lot.”\n\nA moment passed and then her hand was on my shoulder.  “Thomas, you don’t have anything to be embarrassed about.  They are very good at what they do.  All you did was what you thought was right.  Because you’re a good man.”  I shrugged.\n\n“I thought that you were in trouble and I wanted to help.”\n\nShe gently turned me toward her, and when I looked up, she smiled and sniffed again.  “I know, but you need to realize, most people wouldn’t have tried to help.  Not when it meant giving up their job or risking themselves like that.  Not for a stranger.”\n\nI wiped at my face as I looked away.  “Well, I still feel dumb, but I’m glad it’s not real.  I’m glad you’re okay.  That we both are.”  I paused and caught her eye again.  “We are, aren’t we?  Safe, I mean.”\n\nShe hesitated before nodding.  “Yeah, I think so.  Like I said, they have a lot invested in whatever this is, and the fact that they’re willing to go as far as they have with you makes me wonder, but I’ve never seen any signs of anyone getting hurt.  I think the worst that could happen is one or both of us gets fired.”\n\nI felt my face getting red again.  “Oh, don’t worry about that.  I’m going to quit tomorrow.  I’ll finally get to hit their damn buttons.  Maybe both of them.”  I started to smile, but then I saw the look on Melanie’s face.\n\n“Thomas, please don’t do that.  I don’t think they would hurt us, but if you up and quit, they’ll figure out I’ve talked to you.  I don’t think they watch us all the time, but I don’t know what they can find out.  You know, tracking cellphones, spy satellites, whatever.  I’m taking a big risk just being here, and I don’t want them catching on.”\n\nI took a step back from her.  “So you want to keep getting paid to trick people like me.”\n\nShe reached out and grabbed my right hand.  I had been clenching it unconsciously, and it relaxed at her touch.  “No, I don’t want to.  But I wasn’t expecting this.  How the experiment has changed, getting to actually meet you…I can’t do it long-term, but another month or two to save up money?  Now that you’re in on it and won’t be scared or hurt by it any more?”  She smiled.  “That I can do.  That we can *both* do.  We can keep going like normal, take some more of their money, and then one of us can quit.  The next month, the other one can.  How does that sound?”\n\nI shrugged uncertainly.  It made some sense, and once I had calmed down, it would probably make more.  She gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n“And when this is all over, I want to get to know you better.  I know I’ve been playing a role, but for the most part, that’s been me you’ve been watching all this time.  I think it’s only fair I get to see more of you too.”  She blushed.  “Assuming you’re interested in that.”\n\nI felt my hand growing clammy in hers as my stomach fluttered.  “Well, I mean…yeah.  Yeah, I would really like that.”  Swallowing, I added, “How long do we have to wait to see each other again?”\n\nMelanie grinned at me.  “Work another month or so.  Save what you can.  And then quit.  I’ll wait another two or three weeks, and then I’ll do the same.  And then…”  She looked up at the ceiling as she pondered it for a moment, and I was struck again by how beautiful she was, even if she was a little different in person than I had imagined.  ”…three months from tonight we’ll meet right here.  I’ll come over and we can start getting to know each other better.  How’s that sound?”\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded.  “That sounds great.”  \n\n****\n\nWhen she left a couple of minutes later, part of me hated to see her go, but another part was relieved.  I was so exhausted, and while I was so happy she was okay and we had finally met, I felt like the burned up wire in an old lightbulb.  I needed time alone.  Time to think and calm down, and most of all, time to rest.\n\nI didn’t really even remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, I realized my alarm had been buzzing for over thirty minutes.  I jumped up and raced to get to my shift at work.  As she had been leaving, Melanie had stressed again how we needed to act completely the same.  That meant not freaking out, but it also meant not acting like everything was okay either.  If I suddenly showed no signs of being worried about her, that would tip them off too.  I promised and she left after a brief hug and kiss.  Remembering that now, through the haze of my tiredness the night before, it felt like a dream.\n\nStill, I went into the surveillance room with a much lighter heart.  I didn’t have to worry or feel guilty any more about not helping her, and there was some satisfaction in finally pulling one over on the people that had tricked me for so long.  Besides, in three months I would be done with this place and get to see Ra…Melanie again.  In person, at least.\n\nBecause I got to watch her on the video feed as soon as I came into work.  She was asleep when I first got there, and I found myself wondering if she was as tired as I still felt.  When she woke up later and started reading a book, I found myself beginning to smile and had to stop myself.  I should still be worried acting, not smiling like I had a crush.  I had to do better so Melanie didn’t get in trouble.\n\nAn hour or so later she started working on another of “her” paintings.  Watching her work, I was amazed at how real it all looked.  It was hard to see everything from my angle, but I would have sworn she had paint on those brushes and was really painting whatever was on the canvas.  I found myself feeling proud of her.  She really was a great actress.  Not only didn’t I see her giving any clues that we had met or talked, but she really did seem different in the room than she had in my apartment.  I supposed that was what she had meant by “playing a role”. \n\nI was almost at the end of my shift, and while I hated to leave her, I had to admit that I was ready for some more sleep.  Trying to guard my reactions all day had been exhausting, and I was dreading the next few weeks.  But then I realized she was done painting.  I expected her to just go and do something else, but instead she picked up the canvas at its edges and carefully walked it over to the sofa.  Her body was blocking it at first, but then she stepped aside.\n\nIt was a painting of a massive tree.  The bark was a dark red, with a huge twisting trunk that broke off into a dozen branches.  Those branches were covered in leaves that were so deep green they almost reminded me of storm clouds more than the top of a tree.  Like all the paintings, I felt touched by it, even now that Melanie had told me she didn’t paint them.  The images themselves, combined with the colors and the small details…they really were amazing.  \n\nJust like this one.  If you looked close enough, you could see that there were several small blackbirds in the branches of the tree.  It was funny, but they almost looked like they were…\n\nIt almost looked like they were made out of words.\n\nI felt my heart start to hammer and I forced myself to stay calm.  No point in being silly.  I knew it was all a game now, and I just had to play my part a little while longer.  Still, the worried me would want to know what the words said, so I might as well try to read them.  I squinted, following the birds right to left and top to bottom.\n\n**That**\n&nbsp;\n\n**girl**\n&nbsp;\n\n**isn’t**\n&nbsp;\n\n**me**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI looked away from the painting to see Rachel staring up at me.  She looked terrified.\n\n[*Oh no.*](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)"},"254":{"title":"The Monster Under your Bed isn't Always there to Scare You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7xhpsm\/the_monster_under_your_bed_isnt_always_there_to\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed.\n\n“Hey,” the voice called out.\n\nI told myself I was just imagining it. \n\n“Hey kid,” the voice repeated.\n\nI drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“I’m the monster underneath your bed,” the voice replied.\n\n“You mean you’re real?” I asked. \n\n“What do you mean?” the monster said. “Of course I’m real.”\n\n“Do you have a name?” I asked.\n\n“Of course I have a name.”\n\n“Oh... well what is it?”\n\n“Frank.”\n\n“Frank?”\n\n“Yeah,” the monster said. “Is there something wrong with that?”\n\n“No. I mean, I don’t know,” I said. “It’s just not very monster-ly.”\n\n“Well my parents didn’t want me to be a monster.”\n\n“Really?

I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn’t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.\n\nThe warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.\n\nI hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.\n\nMy parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn’t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they’d jumped out the window. \n\nMy parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary’s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. \n\nFrom what I heard Gary’s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. \n\nI never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.\n\nHe tells the doctors that he’s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.\n\n[x](http:\/\/davidmaloneystories.com)"},"255":{"title":"I found an extremely bizarre internet survey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8kalgj\/i_found_an_extremely_bizarre_internet_survey\/","flair":null,"author":"Mr_Outlaw_","selftext":"Nobody knows what rock bottom truly is until they've hit it. \n\nBeing abruptly fired from a job you've worked at for the past ten years, and then catching your girl cheating on you with your replacement really makes a man think. \n\nHell, *my student loans aren't even paid off yet*.\n\nWhat a shitshow this life is. \n\nAfter a rather boozy night that consisted of sending out about four dozen resumes and horrendously written cover letters, I passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I decided to at least *try* and make some money at home while waiting for an interview. \n\nAt that moment, I thought that the best way to go about it was completing those internet surveys that yielded 5 dollar subway gift cards and other shit like that after about an hour of answering questions. I mean, I didn't have any other marketable skills that could've yielded immediate income. \n\nIt was either that or wasting the day away playing computer games. At least I wouldn't have to pay for food. \n\nI did these surveys for about 5 hours before nearly passing out. It was way more excruciating then I'd originally anticipated. At the end of those 5 hours, I'd accumulated about $45 in cash and gift cards. \n\n$9 an hour. Not like I was making much more than that before. I was about to close my laptop up for the day and head to a bar in an attempt drown out my melancholy when I first saw it. \n\nIt shouldn't even have been noticeable... but for one reason or another, it was. At the bottom corner of the website that I was on, existed a tiny, singular advertisement. Maybe it was the simplicity that got me. Plain black letters in a tacky font that read \"Surveys for cash\" overlapped a completely white background. \n\nAt least they were direct with the message. *One more couldn't hurt*, I thought. Might as well scrape together a little bit more booze money before heading out.  \n\nI sat back down, clicked on the picture link and prepared myself to grind through some more painstaking inquires. The first few questions were simple enough. I guess they weren't really questions, but more data collection. My name, age and occupation. I thought it was kind of weird that they also asked my height and weight, but it wasn't unheard of. \n\nThe first **real** question was a different story though. I must have stared at it, eyes wide and mouth agape, for god knows how long. \n\n*What the actual hell?*\n\nIn plain English, this is what popped up on my screen: \"How strong is your urge to currently look behind you?\" \n\nThere were five options below, ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"overwhelming\". \n\nThere was no feasible reason why I should've been afraid at that moment. *But I was*. I tightened my breathing, trying to make out any subtle noises behind me. There were none. After maybe about five minutes, I worked up the courage to look. There was nothing. I sighed in relief and scoffed at myself at the same time. \n\nThis must have been some kind of joke. However, I decided to entertain it, answering \"neutral\" and clicking onto the next question. This is what it read: \"Why would you look behind you?\" \n\nI smirked. *Funny*, before simply typing in a \"I don't know\" in the response box and once again clicking next. This was the 3rd question: \"You're on a plane. Apart from you, there is only one other passenger, who is sitting somewhere behind you. At some point, you get up to go to the washroom, and find that the man is gone. You check to see if he is in the only bathroom on the plane, but he isn't. What do you do?\"\n\nAgain, I must have stupidly stared at it for nearly ten minutes. Was this some kind of obscure personality test? I mean, it must have been, right? *Right?* \n\nI put the same answer that I used for the last question: \"I don't know.\" It was true. I didn't know. How was I *supposed to* answer this shit? \n\nI click next again, now more intrigued than anything. The 4th question went like this: \"You wake up in woods unfamiliar to you. It's nighttime, and the moonlight provides you with only slight visibility. About thirty feet away from you, there is a small, dimly illuminated cabin. The door is open, and a smiling woman is motioning for you to come in. Do you go? Explain why.\" \n\nThis question wasn't necessarily weirder than the last one, so my conjecture that this was some kind of odd personality test was still feasible. I actually make an attempt to answer this one, something along the lines of going into the cabin because there's simply nowhere else to go. \n\nOnce again, I click next. Probably shouldn't have. \n\nThe questions started getting *fucked up*. They weren't too gory or explicit, not anything like that. They were just stranger. Weirder. More psychologically disturbing. If you're wondering why the hell I kept going, I can't really give you an explicit answer to that. I just felt like I *had to*. It was an esoteric, creeping sensation that I can't quite explain away. But I could never shake it. So I just went on. \n\nSome of the questions that stood out were:\n\n\"Suppose that you wake up one night to find an elevator in your house. During every midnight after that, it opens up for five minutes, revealing an exact copy of yourself that gets progressively more injured as time goes on. Do you keep living like this? Or do you enter the elevator once and end it all?\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"You're in a hotel room but are awoken by a rapid knocking at your window. You peek through the blinds, seeing what appears to be a man missing both his eyes. He puts his mouth to the glass and tells you to kill the woman in the bathroom immediately. Do you listen to him?\" \n\nThis was one of my least favorites:\n\n\"You are watching home videos with your mother. One of the tapes include footage of her being murdered by a masked intruder. Your mother simply laughs at this footage without saying anything. In your opinion, is this a cause for concern?\" \n\nIn addition to this insanity-inducing shit, there were some rather disconcerting events happening in *real life* as well. I received a knock at the door about thirty minutes in. I looked through my peephole to find a guy standing there, frantically shaking his head and mouthing \"no\" while making direct eye contact with me. He looked terrified. Obviously, I didn't open up. \n\nI received about ten phone calls from somebody named \"the auditor\" on my caller ID. They left a message every time, but each one was just a recording that consisted of somebody saying numbers through heavy static. Actually, it sounded more like *screaming* now that I think about it.\n\nAbout an hour into this thing, and I was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I was petrified of looking behind me, even though there was no indication that anything should've been there. I heard some soft scratching coming from my vent at one point, so I moved my couch over it. \n\nEventually, I reached what appeared to be the end of the survey. However, it wasn't a question. It was simply a statement. \n\n\"Don't let them in. They're not to be trusted.\" \n\nAlmost as if it were on cue, I heard more knocking at my door about five seconds after reading this. As slowly and silently as I could, I moved over and looked through the peephole once again. It was a different person than the one I'd seen earlier. She was a woman, looking to be in her mid twenties. She was wearing a thick blazer, despite it being around 90 Fahrenheit outside. She was also wearing sunglasses, so I could never really tell where she was actually looking. She eventually took a piece of paper out of her pocket and slipped it under the door. \n\nI look down and read it. \n\n\"It's lying. Leave your apartment immediately.\" \n\nIt's been about half an hour since. I can't bring myself to look at the computer screen nor at the woman outside. She's still there. I can see the shadows of her feet from underneath my door. I heard my bedroom window open a few minutes ago, but I've since jammed the door shut with a chair. I can hear some kind of distorted muttering coming from behind it now. \n\nMaybe rock bottom wasn't so bad. \n\n*But what the fuck am I supposed to do here?* "},"256":{"title":"I’ve been squatting in a condemned high rise. These are the rules I follow to stay safe.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/xyx284\/ive_been_squatting_in_a_condemned_high_rise_these\/","flair":"Child Abuse","author":"ChristianWallis","selftext":"I’m not homeless.\n\nI have a home. I just don’t own it. But it’s mine and I work to keep it. Every city has its fair share of abandoned buildings to squat in, but usually you gotta deal with either cops or shitty neighbours. The Annedale High Rise has neither. Police stay away, so do the locals. As a stranger from out of town I stumbled across the place on my first night in the city and thought it a little strange that a 28 story tower block had been left to rot. Every window black. Every light in the courtyard smashed. No cars in the lot. No booth for a guard. Not even barbed wire on the fence. Barely half-a-mile from a playground filled with shouting drunken teenagers but none of them strayed in the direction of Annedale. No fires or music or bottles hurtling through the air. It was silent.\n\nInside, I found that the lobby had been torn to shit. Double doors ripped open and left that way for what looked like years. Easy access for the curious, but I was the only one there. Most of the first story had collapsed. Waterlogged ceiling tiles turned to mulch by shitty British weather. I know water is invasive, but it had practically fucking colonised the place so bad algae was growing up the walls. Even the elevator shaft was flooded. My own reflection looking back at me as I peered through brackish water and caught a glimpse of the old rusted carriage just a few feet below. I couldn’t help but think about standing on top of it, waist high, and reaching down to pull open the emergency hatch. Only natural to wonder what was down there. Little metal box soaking in pitch black water for years and years. I thought about pressing the button, calling it up and seeing the elevator rise in spite of all logic. An image I still think of from time to time.\n\nMeanwhile the empty shaft loomed above, cables whistling in the wind. I’ve learned not to linger by it. If you look up you’ll sometimes see something ducking out of the way, pulling its head through the doors before you get a good look. It finds it awfully funny, even tries to make a game out of it, like peekaboo. Play too much though and it starts to pop up elsewhere. Any open door becomes an invitation. Sent more than a few people running for their lives in the middle of the night, but bad news for them. That thing is more than free to leave this place if it’s part of a game.\n\nIf you ask about Annedale most people just shrug or laugh. Kids’ll talk about it same way they talk about any haunted house. Difference is no one dares anyone to go up there. No one uses it to get pissed or high. No one sneaks into the basement to have a risky little fuck. No one hides their stashes there. It has all the hallmarks of your classic urban legend, only people *actually* stay away. They’ll laugh and joke and tell scary stories, but they treat the soil its on like it houses a radioactive leak. And the council, I’m surprised they haven’t knocked it down but they, out of everyone in the city, have the most to lose by talking about it.\n\nThey built it in the mid fifties as government housing. Only a lot of the young mothers who moved in there found their children’s health taking a turn for the worse. Started with newborns. Babies that wouldn’t wake after a peaceful night’s sleep. The kinda deaths that got written off as either negligence or abuse, screaming teenage girls hauled off to prison on the words of doctors who didn’t give a shit. It’s always the mother’s fault in some people’s eyes, and these girls had no one to stand up for them. Two in the first year, four in the next, and they kept on coming for every year until it closed.\n\nWasn’t until 1982 that someone traced the source of deaths to tainted water storage on the roof. Toxic metals leeching into the supply. Not enough to kill an adult, but bad news for anyone with weak immune systems. Thirty eight women had been imprisoned by then. Another twenty three had killed themselves before they could be sentenced. And those are just the ones accounted for. Not all the deaths were from the water. Annedale has a way of being bad for any child’s health, no matter the circumstance.\n\nMore than a few toddlers starved to death as their parents rotted in the tub from an overdose. Even more were lost when they found their parent’s stash, little bodies wracked with agonising fits as their panicked mothers screamed for help. One tripped down the elevator shaft because the doors opened as if the carriage was right there. And those are the ones who were found. Plenty more went missing, written off as runaways. In the end Annedale’s reputation as a cursed place got so bad the only way out was to shut the whole thing down. Board it up. Erase it from the records. Pretend it never happened and just forget.\n\nBut Annedale kept on killing even after the doors were officially shut. If anything it only got nastier. Talked to one cop who told me he found a guy dead from sepsis on the sixth floor couple years after the place was shut down. No one could fucking believe it. They reckon this guy scratched himself on a nail and caught gangrene like it was the 1800s. Never went to the hospital. Just laid there and died slowly and painfully as the infection spread, but not before he took every last bit of furniture in the room and shoved it against the door. Strange enough on its own, but it was the flag he’d made out of his own clothes that freaked everyone out. He’d scrawled *HELP* on it, like he wanted to get someone’s attention down below even though the lock was on his side. He could’ve left anytime he wanted.\n\nCop I spoke to said he was there when they kicked the door down. Still remembers the look in dead man’s eyes. He was glaring at the door two days after he’d passed, white knuckled fists gripping a blanket that smelled sickly sweet from all that infection.\n\nThere were others too. Lots of people falling, many of them without a good reason. Got so bad they bricked the roof door but by the time I arrived someone had cleared it all away with a sledge hammer. I still don’t hang out up there. Not after I first went up and saw pale fingers gripping the ledge, like someone was hanging off it and holding on for dear life. I reckon a lotta people see something like that and think a person needs their help. They go rushing over to offer a hand. But when I saw it something about those grimy nails set alarm bells off in my head. Fingers looked all wrong. So I took my coat off and used a broom handle to move it closer to the ledge. Sure enough those ugly hands snatched at the coat and ripped it outta my hands, sending it hurtling to the parking lot below. I’ve thought about taking a closer look from time to time, but I got a thing about heights and could never bring myself to investigate it much further.\n\nYou’d think I’d leave, but it’s my home. I own it as much as it owns me. People even refer to me as the caretaker now like they forgot I wasn’t always here. Police treat me the same, can you believe that? Any reports of a break in and they call me on my number to go take a look, like I’m some sort of official. Only other guy who was here as long as me was the philosopher. I don’t know his name, just call him that because of the books he left behind. He came here back when the block was still just a place to live and he stuck around for a few years after its closure. Lots of notebooks in his flat. Thousands of pages talking about child sacrifice made to gods who don’t like being named, along with pictures of strange things frozen in ice and medical photos that look fake.\n\nAt first I thought he came to document the curse. He has dozens of books just recording all the strange things he saw, like birds with too many wings or milk that turned to clotted blood in the bottle. But after going through every thing he owned I found letters to a wife who’d died in childbirth. He kept her death certificate way at the back of an old looking box filled with the letters he’d kept writing her long after the date.\n\nAnother box, just a row over, had the letters she’d written back. Awful things scrawled on random scraps, shit and blood for ink. He dated them himself and sometimes wrote notes about how they came to him.\n\n*Delivered by a rat that was cannibalised in front of me.*\n\n*Pulled by my dentist from a cavity in my mouth.*\n\n*Written in the web of a spider with thirteen legs.*\n\nAnyway, he gives away the real reason he moved to Annedale in one of the letters. Says that Annedale was the key to helping her, that he was weeks away from figuring out how to open the door. Told his wife he’d bring her back. Told her he knew how. I’ve never figured out where he went next or what happened to him, but his apartment was locked when I found it and likely would’ve stayed that way if the key hadn’t turned up in my inside pocket on the first morning. Now I live in his old place. It’s safe in there. He’s written things on the wall that keep everything well behaved. Symbols that I don’t understand but which are easy to trace so that’s what I do. I go over them every couple of months and so far they’ve kept me safe and sane.\n\nBecause you do need protection in Annedale. I don’t know when in its history the curse went from something mundane to something very real and very dark. It wasn’t all just bad luck or poverty, not by the end and certainly not anymore. You can’t just go strolling around Annedale, certainly not at night. It’s dangerous. For one thing, it attracts a constant rotation of the deeply unwell who are likely to attack on sight, if you’re luckly. They usually turn up dead in the halls come morning, although sometimes it’s just bits of them that I come across. Strips of skin floating on the brackish water that floods the basement stairwell, or bloodied fingernails embedded in the ceiling plaster. Weirdest one was a single tooth in a lightbulb, bloody gum still attached to the root, the glass all around it somehow intact.\n\nMany of them come here with business, something a little like the philosopher’s. Rituals. Bargains. Things like that. It’s not a good idea to interrupt them, or to give them even the slightest hint you might be a problem. Every night I lock my door and wait for Annedale’s business to finish and come morning I do a sweep, floor by floor, and clean up whatever’s left of the tower block’s strange pilgrims.\n\nMost of the rituals don’t look real to me. In fact, I reckon a lotta people who come here just end up as victims of something or someone else. There are a *lot* of reasons to stay out of Annedale at night, and most of its visitors strike me as a little naïve. Most of what I see looks like it got stolen from a bad death metal album. I once found a book called “Satanism and Witchcraft in the 21st Century”. It’s hard to imagine that the secret inner workings of the universe can be found in something with an ISBN number and 3000 Amazon reviews. Of course, not all attempts at exploiting Annedale’s energy are so hackneyed. I had one guy turn up at my door and pay me three grand in cash just to show him the darkest corner in the building. I wasn’t sure what he meant at first. Thought he meant light and shadow.\n\n“Sort of,” he replied when I explained this to him. “Darkness like that can be part of it. But I’m looking for a corner, has to be a right angle or more acute. Ideally, more acute. You understand that term right?”\n\nHe’d seemed arrogant and that last sentence confirmed as much. Good looking guy in his late twenties, nice suit. Looked like the stereotypical banker. Acted like one too.\n\n“Plenty of places like that,” I said. “Lots of funny rooms in Annedale. People trying to make the most of limited space. Sometimes the walls meet at tight angles, sure. But I don’t know what you mean about dark. There’s the basement. It’s flooded. Can’t think of anywhere darker than that.”\n\nHe bit his lip and hesitated for a second or two, as if he was actually contemplating it.\n\n“Not a bad suggestion actually, but no, too difficult to reach. And I don’t just mean dark as in the absence of light. I mean dark like under the bed. Dark like that one chip in a wall that leads to a hollow space between the bricks and as a child you can’t help but wonder what lives there. Somewhere that just inexplicably feels… like it’s not got as much of God’s attention on it as everywhere else.”\n\nI thought about this for a second. His words were vague but damn if I didn’t know what he meant.\n\n“A corner?” I asked. “Has to be an acute corner?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“I think I know the place,” I said and he smiled like real creep.\n\nI took him to a flat on the eighth floor. It was rundown like everywhere else but there was still enough of its old furniture lying around. You can pull open random drawers in there and still see the cutlery people once used. There’s even an old analogue TV on an old stand. You can perch on what’s left of the sofa and stare at that TV and get the feeling you knew the people who lived there once. Run your thumb over the dials on the toaster, the handle of the fridge, or the yellowing plastic of a light switch, and feel an aching loss that creeps up on you out of nowhere.\n\nLook up and you’ll see that the light fixture has been torn out of the ceiling, like someone had tried swinging from it.\n\nNot a big place, by the way. Three rooms. A bedroom with a double bed all rumpled up. A living room slash kitchen. And a tiny little spare room that looked like it once would have been used for storage, or a washing machine maybe, *if* you were single and childless. A slither of space, a triangle carved out of whatever room was left over when other more important walls had been put up. That sofa I mentioned, the TV, they were all placed so whoever was sat down could always keep an eye on that room and its contents.\n\nYou see they’d put a cot inside and it’s still there, bluebottle flies circling overhead. You can’t see inside the cot, not unless you went in and actually pulled the blankets out but it’s been decades and no one has managed it yet. It’s dark behind those old blankets, a heavy shadow that dissuades a closer look, like there’s something in there no one needs to see and it’s spent a long time sat there eating what little light there was. Even with a window in that room, daylight doesn’t really filter down.\n\n“Perfect,” the businessman said when he saw it. He gazed around the flat one detail at a time, his head pausing for a moment and a smile creeping across his face as he laid his eyes on the broken light fixture. And the cot, the sight of it, the flies that still circled above faded Winnie the Pooh blankets, it made the breath catch in his throat.\n\n“Oh this is… *yes* this is good,” he told me. “Dark like under the bed. You’ve earned that money. I could have had a dozen men sweep this place and they wouldn’t have understood the brief as well as you have.”\n\n“Thank you,” I replied even if that wasn’t really how I felt.\n\nQuietly the man sat down and began to unpack his leather satchel. No pentagrams to be found, although he did unpack seven strange looking candles. He caught me looking at them and smiled.\n\n“Home made,” he said. “Each one shaped by my hands. I’m not a good artist, but it’s the effort that counts. Took forever to rend the wax. Of course that was the easy part. The hard part was getting the fat to make it. Did you know there can be a surprisingly high level of security around a hospital’s medical waste department?”\n\n“I didn’t,” I replied as he took out some flimsy bits of wood and a few small nails. He oh so carefully began to nail the splinters of wood together into what looked like random shapes.\n\n“Oh well,” he sighed after a few quiet moments, his fingers nimbly gripping the tiny hammer as he tapped away. Already he’d put together at least six of the strange little wooden polygons, and with each new one I felt a strange sensation. “Would you like to stay and watch?” he asked.\n\n“Absolutely not,” I answered.\n\nHe stopped tapping and smiled once more.\n\n“Oh you’re clever,” he said. “That’s the correct answer, by the way. And if I’m to respect it, I should inform you that now is the safest time to leave.”\n\nI made my way to the exit just as he lit the first candles, but not before I looked towards the cot one last time. I was surprised to see a hollow blackness that extended beyond the doorway, like a curtain had been draped across it, only there was depth to it that drew the eye. The businessman paid it no attention, but after a few more seconds he eventually looked up at me expectantly.\n\n“Can I ask what is it you want?” I said. “Everyone who comes here, I don’t get the sense it ever works out for them.”\n\n“I’m looking for a new kind of afterlife,” he replied.\n\n“Do you need one?”\n\n“We all need one,” he said with a wry chuckle. “But only those of us willing to take a few risks will get a better deal. Everyone else…” He grimaced. “It’s worth the bother. But look who I’m speaking to.”\n\nHe looked to the darkness that enveloped the doorway. Shapes could be seen floating past.\n\n“You should leave now,” he said.\n\nI pulled the door shut and, noticing that the sun was rapidly setting, ran to my apartment where I knew the walls would keep me safe.\n\nWhen I returned the next day the man’s satchel was still where I’d last seen it, propped against one arm of the sofa. The candles had burned down to the very end of the wicks and left a lingering smell that’s still there all these years later. And of the man himself, well in the room with the cot—which still has bluebottle flies orbiting overhead—there is now a shadow burned into the wall. It’s blurry and diffused, but vaguely recognisable as a man on his knees, his head pressed to the floor in a gesture of supplication.\n\nI’ve known it to occasionally move, to turn its head and look towards me at which my point my temples throb, my ears pop, and a darkness begins to encroach upon the edges of my vision. I never exactly considered that flat to be Disneyland before, but now I avoid it like the plague.\n\nStill, it could be worse. Not every ritual ends so cleanly and at times I’ve had to personally intervene, something I hate bitterly. If people want to go poking around in the universe’s undercarriage that’s their business. It’s one thing if I’ve got to sweep what’s left of them up afterwards but at least that’s a one and done job. Sometimes it isn’t so clean. One guy turned up and told me he’d be a new “resident”, my neighbour, and we’d get to know each other. A bumbling old man with an upper class accent and the look of a professor who was down on his luck. He set up in the room next to mine and no matter how little I spoke to him, he never really got the hint and kept trying to act like a good friend. Few times I did initiate conversation it was to tell him the place he’d chosen didn’t have much in the way of protection. He pointed to some funny little rashes and told me *they* were his protection.\n\nOver the next few weeks I’d bump into him from time to time, always on his hands and knees, scraping some dank corner or mouldy pile of bumpy growths. He collected fungi, told me on the first day, and I’d often see him wiping his samples onto petri dishes that he whispered quiet words to whenever he thought I wasn’t around. I don’t think he was sane, but he probably wasn’t completely barmy because he lived long enough to get a sense of Annedale and only come out in the day. Meanwhile his apartment filled up with a growing collection of chittering terrariums and pickle jars, their specimens hidden by murky fluids. All over, he planted and cultivated strange mushrooms and moulds. Encouraged them to soak up the darkness of Annedale and set them to grow in the rife conditions he’d cultivated.\n\nTowards the end his living room had mushrooms growing out the walls. Plaster crumbling beneath microbial armies until there was only concrete and rebar, and even then mould continued to grow and thrive. A few times I peered in and found him feeding meat to the frilly growths that exploded out of the old furniture. During this time the symbols on our shared wall would often grow hot, and I found myself having to replace them on a nearly daily basis as he tinkered away on the other side. I asked him once or twice to tone it down.\n\n“This is important work,” he growled, an unseen darkness creeping into his voice. “I’m not some ditzy crackhead trying to summon the Baphomet! I’m not looking to get *high*. This is science. Progress! That is what I am working towards.”\n\n“Yeah well your progress is trying to eat its way into my flat. Can you ask it to stop?”\n\nHe stopped, froze in mid gesture like I’d said something either profoundly stupid or insightful, or likely a bit of both. He looked at the rashes on his arms that had, by now, started to sprout some of their own strange fruit. When he finally spoke again it was sly, like a lecherous old man propositioning a nurse.\n\n“This fungi,” he said. “They had samples of it in the university for thirty years! Can you imagine? They never even realised what they had until I found it and unlocked its potential. Now I’ve finally found the source and I can do things no one else thought possible. This entire time my thesis has depended upon the idea that the fungus has… a capacity for information processing way beyond anything we’ve considered before. And your idea is a good one, you know? Asking it just might be an option…”\n\nHe scuttled off without another word and for the next few days he set about the building like a furious little honey bee in Spring. Poking and prodding, setting trap after trap and cleaning them vigorously of any rats or mice he caught. When I did my morning sweeps I’d find him hovering over Annedale’s latest victims, scraping what was left of them into transparent bags for his own purposes.\n\n“Don’t mind me,” he’d mutter. “It’s worthless to you, but these poor souls could help me achieve great things.”\n\nThis persisted for another month. He no longer scraped mould or mushrooms off old apartments. He became interested only in meat, and by the time it came to an end I can say confidently that I have never smelled anything worse than the prickly musty odour that wafter out from under his locked door. It became so bad that I began to wonder if I might have to ask for police help and have him removed when, finally, he simply disappeared from Annedale’s halls. One morning he was there, annoyingly shooing me out of the way as he lowered jars into the flooded basement, and then the next he was gone and Annedale’s halls were silent once more.\n\nBut that didn’t mean he had moved out. Far from it, actually.\n\nIt took two days before I decided to just go ahead and break his door down. I kicked at it with a short sharp blow only to find my leg immediately disappeared through wood that had the texture of sodden cardboard. I freed my foot and tried a different tactic, grabbing the handle and pulling so hard that it simply *popped* right out of the rancid wooden frame. Free to move, the door swung open with an eerie creak and fetid air, hot and damp, blew out of the room.\n\nInside I found that the man’s specimens had gone wild. Terrariums had shattered, their contents spilling outwards. Frogs as large as footballs glared at me from behind furry fronds, and insects with human eyes scuttled away before the amphibians could snatch them up. In one corner rats had built a hive out of old cardboard, their backs covered with fungal growths that resembled human fingers and other appendages. In another corner something that looked a little like a black rubber sheet slapped furiously at passing vermin and it took me a few seconds to realise it was a slime mould. When it finally caught something it dragged the strange creature squealing into the dark corner where it grew and constricted around its meal like a fist. I stared at it horrified until one by one black orbs unveiled itself from within the strange mass and I realised it had eyes to stare right back at me.\n\nIt was a cacophony of God awful terror, so gripping that it kept me from hearing the muffled noise of a human struggling to speak. Eventually it did reach my ears and I used my torch to light up the far wall without having to actually step inside.\n\nI found the scientist half-grown into the wall. Algae and moss coated him head-to-toe so that he was no longer recognisable, but I had to assume it could be no one else. Wide eyes glared at me with terror and pain as nasty little critters nibbled away at what was left of his shins, meanwhile strange tendrils probed at his ears and head, never resting for a moment. He kept trying to speak, but the algal growths kept driving their way into his mouth until, one-by-one, they pushed too far and something snapped. His eyes went wider still, his squeals became hysterical, and his jaw slowly slid further down his chest until it hit the floor with a sodden thump.\n\n“Finally made contact?” I asked. “An awful idea if I’ve heard one. What would a mushroom have to say even in the best of circumstances? Let alone one that was grown in the ruins of Annedale? I can only assume you never got around to telling it to stay off my wall, did you? No you probably had your own reason or doing all of this and that’s what took priority.”\n\nThat made me wonder what it was he’d asked for. As the thought entered my head I took a quick look around and tried to see if anything particular stood out to me. Something was growing on the sofa that looked strangely human-shaped. It might have been just my imagination, but in the dark it seemed to turn towards me. Meanwhile the scientist continued to shiver in agony, his eyes focused on me and begging for help.\n\n“I’ll see what I can do,” I said before slamming the door. Something about that strange pile on the sofa had deeply unsettled me.\n\nI put the word out, asked for a gun, but got a crossbow instead a few days later. A nervous looking sixteen year old boy ferried it to my door. I was surprised he’d entered the building, but who knows who’d ordered him to do so. I’ve acquired a strange sort of respect amongst the locals and it comes in handy. This boy looked like he would have stamped on my head and robbed me blind any other day, but when he spoke to me he did so with more respect than I ever imagined I deserved. I thanked him, took the crossbow, spent an afternoon practicing with it, and then used it to kill the scientist the next morning.\n\nTook a few hits, but in the end one thumped into his forehead and shut down his whimpered moans. I didn’t see anything on the sofa this time, at least not anything human-shaped, which I was thankful for. After that it was a simple case of calling the police and beginning a long chain of events that ended with half-a-dozen men in hazmat suits spraying the room with noxious chemicals. For a while there I’d been worried that they’d find a corpse and ask questions, but by the time anyone actually entered the room there was nothing left of the scientist save a splotch on the floor.\n\nI never did figure out exactly what it was he was after, although it is not uncommon for my morning sweep to turn up a body (or part of) covered in fungal growths. And I have been known to occasionally catch glimpses of a strange person lowering themselves into the floodwater of the elevator shaft. Of course I might just be making connections that aren’t really there. All sorts of things live in that water. The entire level is flooded and if something was down there, it’d have free reign over quite a large space.\n\nIt's a strange world down there. I should know on account of one visitor who gave me a very bad time. I’ll call him the fisherman since he came to Annedale because of the flooded basement. Saw a photo that’s been circulating around for a while now, if you know where to look. God knows who took it and how, but it shows the flooded stairwell leading to the basement and beneath the brackish surface is a hand that’s all out of proportion. Fingers splayed with perfect symmetry like a starfish, it is reaching up out of the depths and resting gently on the third step below the water.\n\nWhen I first met him he was sitting happily with his feet over the edge of the flooded shaft, water up to his knees, with a rod and line set up beside him. It was quite a surprise at first, seeing him there with a little fly-fishing hat. A chubby but healthy looking man in his forties with an egg mayo sandwich in one hand and a phone playing candy crush in the other. I called out to him as I approached because, in my experience, startling someone in Annedale is bad for your health no matter how sane the visitor appears.\n\nHe looked up when I caught his attention and smiled amiably.\n\n“Hello,” he waved with his sandwich. “You’re the caretaker?”\n\n“Yes I am,” I answered. “And you are?”\n\n“Just a tourist,” he smiled. “Care to join me?”\n\nThe sun had risen only moments ago.\n\n“You weren’t here when it was dark, were you?” I asked more than a little suspicious.\n\n“Oh no you’ve only just caught me, been here barely ten minutes before you showed up. I was told you’d be willing to help in exchange for a small fee.”\n\n“What sort of help?” I asked.\n\n“Oh just give me a nudge if any of the lines start moving,” he said while pointing to a rod he’d set up beside the basement stairs. The door was propped open and the line led down into the darkness below, water gently lapping just out of sight. Another line had been set up in a corner of the lobby where the floor had been torn away revealing a hole straight down into the basement. “I can’t keep an eye on them all at once, you see. I have bells ready but, well, two heads are better than one.”\n\n“What is it exactly you’re hoping to catch down there?” I asked.\n\n“Are you familiar with the primordial ocean?” he said. “The abyssal waters that God split into light and dark, all that? It’s not a physical location, per se, but it does connect to certain bodies of water depending on the time and place. Last recorded manifestation was in a glass of old whiskey underneath a forgotten bar in Mexico City. Some poor fellow knocked it over and didn’t notice until the following day when half the bar was suddenly underwater. Quickly rectified but some of the things swimming in that water were something else, and all from at the bottom of a glass no wider than my wrist. Imagine what we can do with this!?” he said while gesturing at water by his feet.\n\n“You think there could be fish alive down there?” I asked.\n\n“At least,” he replied. “I’d be willing to pay for any reliable information, of course. Do you have any idea what might be down there?”\n\n“Not really,” I shrugged. “But I’d guess it wants to be left alone.”\n\n“Hmmm you might be right there,” he said while looking at his other rods. “I didn’t exactly put down any old lure, you know?”\n\nHe reached into his pocket and took out a strange tuft of fur and ivory, holding it up for me to squint at.\n\n“A tooth from a man who drowned in the sea. A drone collected it off a shipwreck near the Norwegian coast. The fur is actually red algae that was found growing on his bones. I have plenty of these and, well, other things that might appeal to what’s on the other side. My research was thorough and expensive. Come on, take a seat. Flat fee, one thousand, just sit here until the sun starts to set.”\n\n“I just have to sit?” I asked.\n\n“And let me know if you hear or see anything.”\n\nI groaned and sat beside him, folding my legs instead of letting them dangle in the water below. Despite my reticence, we stayed like that for several hours. He’d brought lots of food, good homemade stuff, along with plenty of cold beer. We sat there and spoke very little, but we did eat and drink a tremendous amount. Not the kind of thing I do normally, but I was being paid to be there, and I didn’t really have anywhere else to be. It was, all in told, a very pleasant afternoon.\n\nUntil I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was with a terrible gasp. My chest was tight like something had been sitting on it, and judging from the terrible giggling and scampering feet I heard running off into the darkness, it might not have been *just* a feeling. Already panic was setting in as my eyes darted to the open doors and saw that the moon was out and had been for hours. I fumbled for my torch and turning it on saw that there was no sign of the fisherman. All his stuff had been left behind yet all that remained of him was his hat that still floated on the water. Even as I watched, a smooth glistening shape curled beneath the water and plucked it off the surface.\n\nI recoiled and crawled away from it as fast as I could. This was bad, I knew deep in my heart I’d never been as at risk I was in that moment. The open doors that led outside were tempting, but just beside them were the stairs that led downwards and I swore I could hear something approaching. I couldn’t help but picture the fungal man I’d seen in the scientist’s flat. Then again, that basement was huge and who knows what lay down there.\n\nI decided to go for the stairs. The entire time my heart was in my chest. I had never been caught outside my room at night, not since my first night when I’d slept in the lobby with my coat pulled over me. You don’t get lucky twice, not with Annedale, so I knew had to be careful. I had to be quiet. My only hope was to go unnoticed. I took to stealth, climbing each floor in perfect silence, hiding in well known spots at the slightest hint of footsteps, human or otherwise.\n\nAnnedale comes alive at night. Whispered mutterings from strange children who descend from air vents, living there for God knows how long. Other times I saw apparitions including one, a toddler, the sight of whom made my stomach growl with an insatiable hunger that hurt just to contemplate. She stared at me with pleading eyes as I slunk away from her open door. I might have been tempted to help her were it not for the sight of the moon peering through her translucent image.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I somehow made it to the fourteenth floor alive. Only it was there right at the final hurdle, so close to safety, that I came across something out of my worst nightmare.\n\nA woman stood outside my apartment door. Silent. Pale. Dirt covered fingernails. It was all too often I’d open my door and find muddy impressions on the floor made by a woman’s bare feet. Now I knew who left them every night. I couldn’t see her face from where I hid, but something about her seemed profoundly familiar.\n\nWhen she finally turned towards me I remembered. I recognised her, even though most of her face was missing. It was the philosopher’s wife. He had succeeded, it seemed. But I couldn’t imagine at what God awful price, because the woman who stared at me had clearly weathered some years in the grave. It was only the poor lighting and her long hair that had covered up just how bad a state she was in. A lipless grin stared back at me below sunken cheekbones and hollow eye sockets. And yet, I could tell that in another life she had been beautiful which only made the sight all the more gut-wrenching.\n\n“My darling,” she whispered, and there was something about her voice that I found hard to stay sane in the face of. I don’t know why. Over a decade in that place and I’d borne witness to living nightmares, but it was *this* walking corpse that pushed me to my limits. The inescapable feeling of loss weighed me down and without realising it I found myself taking steps towards her even as my knees buckled. By the time I reached her I was crawling until I could clutch her grimy icy leg, and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up in my bed the following morning.\n\nEverything seemed normal, so completely mundane that I could’ve written the whole thing off as a bad nightmare. But there were footprints leading from my bed to the door. And later on I found the fisherman’s things much as he left them, although when I finally reeled his lines in I found the lures gone and replaced with bits and pieces of the man who’d first set them up. I threw it all into the water below and decided it would be best to forget him.\n\nEvery now and again, of course, I can’t help but check my peephole at night. I never did before that, but now I do. I see her every single time. She looks sad. Hurts me to think of her out there. It ought to be terrifying but it’s more like someone’s ripped out my stomach and heart and let all my insides fall out the bottom.\n\nEach time I see her I wonder what exactly was it he did to bring her back?\n\nHe leaves only one hint. A final letter, I think. It’s not like he dated them. In it he says he would give everything to have her in his arms once more. Not only his life, but everything he’s already lived. Every sunset. Every good dream. Every nightmare. Every victory. Every loss. Every little memory that makes him who he is, he’d give it all just to save her.\n\nSometimes I wonder about him, figuring we’d probably be about the same age. I’d like to think back and imagine what it would have been like for the two of us to meet as young men, but for some reason whenever I try to remember what my life was like before I came to this city, before I woke up with that coat pulled over me… well, I don’t know…\n\nIt’s just hard, that’s all.\n\nIt's almost like there's nothing there. Like something reached in and took all the years away. I guess it's just one of those things I'm better off not dwelling on."},"257":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 2!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"First post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nSo I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I'll address a few things that you guys have brought up:\n\n* There's been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I'm not trying to rip him off in any way, I've got nothing but respect for the guy. He's actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time they aren't solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven't been on many calls like that, but I'll share a few that I've seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.\n\n* There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I'll touch on that briefly here, and I'll also include a story. \nThey come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse: they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. \nThe stairs don't go up infinitely, or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone cut-and-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don't have any pictures, it's never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don't really feel like risking my job over it. I'll try again in the future, but I can't really promise anything.\n\n* A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of this peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I'll try to avoid that in the future.\n\nAlright, on to the new stories:\n\n* As far as missing persons go, I'd say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls; people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn't believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects. We're a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That's what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we *did* find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers.\nAn older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn't come home when he should have. Apparently he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn't taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn't go with him. I don't ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn't matter. Someone is missing, and it's my job to find them. We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn't long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured, and we need a full team to help get them out safely. \nWe meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what's going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there's a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it's just hanging there. There's no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don't see any other signs that he's still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it's obvious no one's in it. We're all just sort of left scratching our heads. We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point there's not much we can do. The guy's wife called us every day for *months*, asking if we'd found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time.\nI'm not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy's cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.\n\n* Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn't matter what circumstances they go missing under, it's never easy, and we always, *always* dread the ones we find deceased. It's not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn't be, or couldn't be. I can honestly say I've heard about this kind of thing happening more than I've seen it, but I'll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.\nA mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She's watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area either, which is important.\nShe packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area. Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it's on a *very* clearly established trail. It's almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you're deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out, starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She's screaming his name, and she says at one point she thinks she heard him answer her. Now obviously she can't go blindly running into the woods, she's got the other two kids, so she calls the police and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him.Over the course of this search, which spans *miles*, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can't pick up any scent, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course there's suspicion about the mother for a while, but it's pretty clear that she's completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help.  But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. \nThe volunteers keep searching, though, and one day we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we've been looking for. \nI have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I've never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and half-way up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars and sure enough, it's the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid's shirt, so he knows right away that it's the missing boy. That's when he calls it in, and we're dispatched.\nIt took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing. Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it's hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I'm certain.\nNot only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty. So it wasn't as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn't been dead that long. He'd been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he'd only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I've ever been on. \nWe found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He'd frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects, and no answers. To date, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.\n\n* One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he'd been last seen. Kid wasn't even aware that he'd wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I'm really not good with kids, and I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. \nAs my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It's a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it's easier. We hike out there, it's a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we're walking around the area and she's pointing out places she's found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we're in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there's back roads you can take to get closer if you don't want to hike that far. But we're on state-protected land, which means there can't be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you'll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there's one thing you learn quickly, it's that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn't say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up.\nIt's a staircase. In the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It's just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it's out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren't carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it's made of. It's almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. \nI stand there, and it's like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I'm seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it's the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles.\n'Get used to it, rookie. You're gonna see a lot of them.' I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard.\n'I wouldn't do that.' She says. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. 'You're gonna see them all the time, but don't go near them. Don't touch them, don't go up them. Just ignore them.' I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she's looking at me tells me that it's best if I don't. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn't come up again for the rest of my training.\nShe was right, though. I'd say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they're relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they're twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They're usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they've been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet.\nI've tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. 'It's normal. Don't worry about it, they're not a big deal, but don't go close to them or up them.' When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don't really know what else to tell them. I'm really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\n* This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there's a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn't likely that we'd find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me. Most of you who ski or snowboard, or spend any amount of time on a mountain, will probably have guessed too. When snow falls, it doesn't collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that's filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They're called tree wells, and they're not immediately obvious if you don't know what you're looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn't read them, or doesn't take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. \nMy best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated. It's called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn't usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal.\nWhat scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn't die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can't even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.\n\n* A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I've ever seen the Goatman while I've been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I've never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole 'black-eyed man' thing, but I didn't see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I'm not sure I'm willing to chalk it up to the Goatman.\nWe'd gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails, and needed assistance getting back down to the main area.\nWe hike up to where she's at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she's passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we're getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened. I can't remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:\nShe'd been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn't quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don't think I could forget it if I tried.\n\"It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn't see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that's when I fainted.\" \nNow, obviously I'm a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting 'meow, meow' at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I'm gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don't see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and I when I head back I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It's almost sunset by this point, and I don't have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow. But as I'm headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn't come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone. As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It's almost like it's coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. \nI didn't get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird. \n\nSo this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I'll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I'm sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!\n\nEDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I'll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I'll include my friend's stories, and I'll see if I can't get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn't sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you're all okay with it, I'll post lots of stories!\n\n**EDIT: Part 3 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"258":{"title":"The Grim Reaper's scythe isn't to harvest you.

No monstrous visage discovered yet has been as terrifying as the infinite potential for horror which exists before the mask is removed. \n\nThat is why we humans, in our naive misunderstanding of the universal order, are gripped by the mortal fear of death. We think it the final frontier - the greatest imaginable unknown from whose penumbral shores no traveler may return. And so we cling desperately onto even the most dreary and anguished lives, suffering any known evil over our release into the beyond. \n\nBut death is not to be feared, because death is very well understood. We have witnessed it, caused it, measured and recorded it to the last dying spasm of neuronal flickering. Even as I lay dying, it seemed silly to me that I should be afraid of the emptiness which reason promised to expect. \n\nWhile I was alive I wouldn't experience death, so there was no reason to be afraid now. When I was dead, I wouldn't be capable of experiencing anything, so fear still had no cause. That thought brought me great comfort as I felt the last erratic struggle from my heart against the inevitable conclusion I approached. It wasn't until I was finally drifting off to sleep that a final intrusive doubt bubbled in my brain:\n\n*What if it isn't death which is to be feared? What if it is what lies beyond?*\n\nAnd so troubled did I slip beyond mortal understanding, stepping into a world as far forsaken by reason as I was now from life. I was still in the hospital room, but the bustle of nurses and the beeping machines lost their opacity as though I was mired in swiftly descending dusk. It seemed as though every sound was an echo of what it once was; every sight a reflection. With each passing moment, the world was becoming less real...\n\nBut all that sight and sound - all that being - it wasn't simply disappearing. It was *transforming* into a figure beside me. The less real my room became, the more real the figure was, until presently it existed in such sharp actuality that nothing beside it seemed real at all. \n\nHis cloak was black. Not the *color* black, but its essence. It was as though seeing a tiger after a lifetime of looking at a child's crude drawing and thinking that's all a tiger was. Reality flowed around his scythe like a brush through water colors, and I could see each elementary particle and time itself sunder across its blade. \n\nSurely this, I thought. This is why we were taught without words to fear death. I clutched at my hospital blanket to cower from the intensity of the Reaper's presence, but the once soft cotton now flowed like translucent mist through my hands. I knew in that moment that nothing could hide me from the specter's grasp, for he was the only real thing in this world. \n\n**You're late.**\n\nThey weren't words. My head ached from the strain of this knowledge as my lateness was burned into my awareness, imparted like an inescapable law of physics as unequivocal as gravity. \n\n**We don't have time for the usual speech. Hurry now.**\n\nI felt myself swept up around him like dirt in a hurricane. Before I knew what was happening, we were outside the hospital, moving at such a frenzied pace that the world around me blurred into a dizzying tunnel of flashing light. \n\n**If you're lucky, IT will have gotten bored of waiting for you.**\n\nI had too many questions, all fighting for attention in the forefront of my brain without any making their way out. \n\n**You're quiet. I admire that. Usually people ask too much.**\n\n\"What's the point?\" I asked. My voice felt flat and dead compared to his overwhelming substance. \"How can I try to comprehend something so beyond mortal knowledge?\"\n\n**You can't. But it's still human nature to ask.**\n\nWe weren't slowing. If anything, our pace was increasing. I wasn't running, or flying, or anything of that nature. It was more like the rest of the world was moving around us while we stood still. A vague darkness and a heavy damp smell made me guess that we'd gone underground, but I couldn't say for sure. \n\n\"One question then,\" I asked. \"What else is here besides you?\" \n\n**And that is why questions are pointless. Death is not a place, or a person. It's all there is.**\n\nTroubling thought, but made more so by the growing howl which began reverberating the rocks around me. We still seemed to be descending into the Earth, and the air was growing warmer and denser now. The sound continued to mount as though the world itself was suffering. \n\n\"Then what is IT?\"\n\n**What I'm here to protect you from.**\n\nThe rocks split from a flash of his scythe, and the ground opened further into a sprawling cavern dominated by a subterranean lake. \n\n\"But I thought you said you were all there is.\"\n\n**No, I said Death was all there is.**\n\nWe weren't moving any longer. Light glinted off the scythe from some unseen source and streamed into the lake like a tributary. Once inside, the light didn't reflect or dissipate, but swirled and danced like luminescent oil. \n\n\"I thought you were Death.\"\n\n**Death is not a person.**\n\nThe light was taking a life of its own inside the water. The still surface began to churn with the enigmatic energy. It took my scattered mind a long while to realize that *I* was the energy flowing into the lake. I still felt tangled up with the figure, but we now existed as a beam of light boiling into the water. \n\nI knew I wouldn't understand, but that didn't stop me from feeling frustrated. If Death is all there is, then what is IT? What was waiting for me? The water pressed in around me and I couldn't speak, although I could still draw breath somehow. \n\n**IT is here.**\n\nSomething was in the water around me. Hands grabbed me by the legs and began dragging me downward. I was amazed to even discover I had limbs again. They felt so alien to me that it was almost as though this body was not my own. Light flashed from the scythe - then again. The hands let go, and the howling rose once more. The Reaper was fighting something, although I couldn't make any sense of the battle except for the madness of thrashing water.\n\nThe howling Earth reached its crescendo, and the *screams* made the water around me convulse and contract like living fluid. Had the Reaper cut it? Was I safe? I began to explore my new body in the water, but just when I thought I was beginning to gain control the hands clutched me once more. I lurched downward, struggling in vain against their implacable grip. \n\n\"What is here?\" I tried to shout against the suffocating liquid. \"What is happening?\" \n\nBut I couldn't sense the Reaper's presence any longer. The heat was unbearable, but the cold depths the hands were dragging me toward was even worse. I became aware of a blinding light at the bottom of the lake, and though I struggled, the hands dragged me inexorably onward. \n\n**I'm sorry. I couldn't fight IT off.** It seemed to be coming from so far away now. **We will try again next time.** \n\nThe pressure - the heat - the noise - the hands dragging me into the blinding light. I closed my eyes and screamed. I was free from the water now, but I just kept screaming. I couldn't bear to look at IT - whatever had stolen me. Whatever was Death but wasn't - whatever even the Reaper could not defeat. \n\nThen words spoke. Real, human words from a real human mouth. My senses were so distraught that I couldn't make sense of them, but I'm guessing they were something like: \n\n\"Congratulations! He's a healthy baby boy.\" \n\nMost people can't remember the day they die, or the day they were born. I happen to remember both, and I know that [they are the same](http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sirtobiaswade).

My twin sister, Chel, begged me to rush with her the summer before our freshman year approached, but I think she knew deep-down I was a lost cause. I was a band geek in high school, and a band geek I intended to remain.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't some \"not like other girls\" bullshit. I was happy for Chel. I even got trashed on celebratory wine coolers with her when she pledged her sorority. We just had different interests. As long as she was happy, that’s all that mattered, and I know she felt the same about me.\n\nHow did I miss that she was so deeply unhappy?\n\nShe threw herself off the bell tower in the center of campus less than 3 weeks before the end of the spring semester. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of days; I was holed up at the library pulling double all-nighters to finish my final paper for Greek and Roman Mythology. I woke up in the early afternoon on a Sunday to 10 missed calls from mom and a text from Chel. \n\n*love u forever Lou. i’m so sorry.*\n\n2:55 a.m. Witnesses say she jumped at 3:02.\n\nI skipped finals, took incompletes in all of my classes, and headed home to be with my mom. Alex, our best friend from high school, offered to bail on the rest of the semester too, but I didn’t want him to lose his scholarship. Still, he made the 2-hour drive home every weekend to hang with me. We didn't talk much; it still hurt too much to remember the good times, and I didn't care much about the present. But it was better than drinking alone, and Alex was generous with sharing his weed.\n\nMy mom insisted I get back into the swing of things this Fall. I decided just to do a half-time course load, mostly focused on finishing up my classes from last semester. I moved into a solo room in the dorms that’s more the size of a closet than a real livable space. I didn’t mind being alone. I kind of preferred it that way.\n\nAlex, though, thought that the solitude was bad for me. Or at least that’s what he claimed when he dragged me along to a Greek party last weekend. Chel was popular among the guys in his fraternity, he said, and they’d all been asking about me. Worried. I really didn’t want to go, but Alex wouldn’t let up.\n\n“It’s what Michelle would want, Louise.” \n\nAsshole. Even if he was right.\n\nThat’s how I found myself last Saturday in the passenger seat of Alex’s BMW, driving out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I quickly realized I had no idea where the hell we were or where we were headed. I’d never gone to a frat party with Chel - navigating a sea of sweaty dudes who smell like PBR isn’t my ideal night out - but I was pretty sure most frat houses weren’t 45 minutes from campus, tucked away off a dirt road that didn’t even have a name on Google Maps.\n\nI picked at a fraying thread on the hem of my sweater, one of Chel’s. It was bright green and haphazardly cropped at the waist in a homemade chop job. It wasn’t my style at all, and I never would have worn it before Chel...before she was gone. But that night, wearing it gave me confidence, like she was there with me.\n\n“So....what’s the deal with this party anyway? Or are you driving me out to the middle of nowhere to murder me?” \n\nAlex rolled his eyes and fished a piece of black cardstock out of the mess of napkins on his center console. The paper was heavy, expensive, with gold-embossed letters glittering in a scrolling font:\n\n*You Are Cordially Invited*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega welcome you to our Fall semester Culling.*  \n*Attendance is mandatory.*  \n*Only the true of heart will remain until dawn.*  \n*Will that be you, Alex?*\n\n“Did all the guys in the house get one of these?” I turned the paper over, where an address and time was listed. County Road 5. Midnight.\n\n“Yeah, ‘bout a week ago? We’re still trying to figure out who’s hosting.” \n\n“It’s not this Omega sorority?”\n\nAlex laughed at me, not unkindly. “There’s no such thing, Louise.”\n\nI frowned. A party in the middle of nowhere, hosted by nobody? I was already starting to regret abandoning my resolve to live the semester as a hermit.\n\n“None of this is creeping you out? What does it mean by ‘Culling,’ anyway?” \n\n“Ah, it’s just for dramatics. See who can stick it out all night, ya know? Maybe there’ll be a prize. And you know what?” He grinned and slapped me on the thigh. I slapped him back. “We’re not gonna pussy out. We’ll be the winners, last ones standing, just like old times. You with me?”\n\n“I turn into a pumpkin after 2.”\n\n“I’m serious, Lou.”\n\n“So am I, *Alexander.*” He knew I hated being called Lou. Chel always called me Lou. “Besides, are they even going to let me in? I didn’t get one of these.” I shook the invitation in his face. \n\nI was starting to have a really bad feeling. If I’d known about all this weirdness beforehand, I would’ve already been in bed. Tossing and turning on my lumpy twin mattress, brainstorming ways to beg Professor Dickson for yet another extension on my first paper, sounded better than stumbling into the plot of *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*.\n\n“C’mon, Louise, if it’s lame, we’ll bail. And they’ll definitely let you in. I mean, you look just like her, they’ll -”\n\n“Feel sorry for me?”\n\nI took grim satisfaction seeing the smile slip off his face. \n\n“No, absolutely not.” His lips pulled down into a frown and I looked away. “Louise,” his large hand grasped my fingers gently. His voice had gone soft.  “I just mean that everybody loved Chel, and they’ll love you too. Just like she did.” \n\nI looked out the window and blinked hard once, twice, before clearing my throat. \n\n“Fine. But the *second* I’m ready to leave, we’re leaving, prize be damned.”\n\nAlex squeezed my hand and let go. “Deal.”\n\nWe continued the drive in silence. Alex drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and I scanned the empty fields on the side of the road. We’d pulled off on the county road over 10 minutes ago; we’d almost missed the turn-off, which was only marked by a small, weathered wood sign, embossed with a gold Omega symbol. There was still no sign of a party.\n\n“Alex…”\n\nAlex shifted in the driver’s seat and hunched over the steering wheel, squinting into the darkness.\n\n“Yeah...it’s uh...I feel like we should have seen it by now.”\n\nHe laughed, high-pitched and thready. I continued unraveling the loose thread on the hem of Chel’s sweater.\n\nThe BMW crested a large hill, and I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. A large, white farmhouse stood in the valley below us, a fleet of Land Rovers and Mercedes parked haphazardly in the grass out front.  Alex laughed - much more genuinely, this time - and patted my knee as he parked next to a Lexus.\n\n“Relax, it’s gonna be fun.”\n\nI mustered up a smile but didn’t say anything. Alex grinned and hopped out of the car. I peered up at the house. The facade was bright and cheery, freshly painted with bright blue shutters flanking the windows, the front door a bubbly yellow. The interior, glimpsed through the open blinds, looked warm and inviting, and I could already feel the bass beat of a shitty pop song vibrating softly in my chest. It all looked pretty innocuous. Maybe I could have a good time. For Alex. \n\n*For Chel.*\n\nThe loud clunk of the passenger door opening startled me. Alex arched his eyebrow, forearm braced on the roof of the car.\n\n“Are you coming, or were you planning to wait in the car all night?”\n\nI rolled my eyes and unbuckled. I socked him on the arm as I climbed out of the car.\n\n“Let’s have some fun or whatever.”\n\nI didn’t need to worry about getting in the door. There was nobody checking invitations. We were greeted by a loud cheer of “Alex!” when we entered the living room, the party well underway.\n\nA few guys ran up, thumping Alex on the back and nodding my way in polite acknowledgement. I was suddenly enveloped in a bear hug by a man whose name I couldn’t remember, overwhelmed by a cloud of Axe and sour beer-breath.\n\n“We’re so glad you could make it, Lou. We miss Chel so much.”\n\nA chorus of drunk voices chimed in, booming in the small space of the foyer.\n\n“CHEL!”\n\nSour-breath let me go to pump his fist in the air, and the boys all started chanting Chel’s name. I couldn’t decide whether I was endeared or disgusted. Alex flushed and elbowed one of his brothers in the ribs. I was about to give him shit when another, much more slender arm wrapped around my shoulders.\n\n“Oh, Louise! I didn’t know you were going to be here.” \n\nAnna, the president of Chel’s sorority, had to crouch down to hug me. Her words were slurred, her movements languid and clumsy, but her big brown eyes were clear and focused when she pulled back. Anna had always liked Chel, took her under her wing when she first started pledging, and she’d always made me feel welcome in the house. So it was out of the ordinary that she looked concerned, rather than pleased, to see me.\n\n“Uh...yeah. Alex said it would be cool?” I glared in Alex’s direction. He just shrugged.\n\nAnna’s brow furrowed, but before she could answer, another voice chimed in, rich and melodic.\n\n“Oh? I didn’t realize this was Alex’s party.”\n\nAnna froze, and her eyes widened. Slowly, she turned to face three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life. Despite their striking appearance, I don’t know that I could describe any of them now; it’s all kind of fuzzy in my memory, but I do know that they were supermodel tall, willowy, with bright eyes that seemed to stare right through you. One of the women - sparkling green eyes boring into mine - spoke again in the same resonant tone.\n\n“Anna? Who’s your party-crasher friend?”\n\nShe smiled when she said it, and her tone betrayed no ill will, but I still shrank back behind Anna instinctually. I looked around again for Alex, but he had wandered off already. That set off distant alarm bells in my head, after all his promises that we would stick together, but I couldn’t focus on anything but the woman in front of me. Anna grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly.\n\n“Oh, uh...this is, you remember Chel, the girl I told you about? This is her sister, Louise, and...well, I  think Alex just thought...”\n\nAnother of the three women, grey eyes this time, stepped around Anna in one smooth motion, interrupting her rambling. She grabbed my hand out of Anna’s and clasped it between both of her own. Her skin was cool, almost cold, but her grip was soft. I thought I was just rocking a stupid crush at the time, but the world seemed to tilt off center when she bent down to meet me at eye-level, voice whisper-soft yet strong enough to carry over the house music thumping through the floorboards.\n\n“Darling, I’m so sorry about your sister, but I’m really not sure this party is your scene.”\n\nAnna looked downright panicked by this point, falling all over herself to apologize to the trio. I scanned the crowd and, aside from Alex and a couple of his fraternity brothers, I only saw one other person at the party who looked familiar, a girl from Chel and Anna’s sorority - Beth? Stacy? - who I knew almost nothing about. Chel had never introduced me to her. A distant part of me registered that I should be embarrassed, or, that if Anna was panicking, maybe I should be too. Instead, I felt a strange sense of calm, content to follow wherever that voice might lead me.\n\n“Of course, I didn’t mean to cause any trouble…”\n\nThe third woman stepped forward and rested a graceful hand lightly on my shoulder. Bright blue eyes danced kindly. I couldn’t look away.\n\n“No trouble at all, sweetheart, just let me walk you to your car.”\n\nAnna looked on helplessly as the two women guided me slowly to the door. A tiny splinter of logic somehow managed to pierce the haze that had settled over my brain.\n\n“I don’t have a car. Alex drove me.”\n\nGrey-eyes and blue-eyes looked at each other for a few minutes, seeming to have a silent conversation. Blue-eyes finally sighed and turned back to me. \n\n“Well then, I guess there’s nothing for it. Want to keep me company in the kitchen?”\n\nI could feel the dopey grin splitting my face, but I couldn’t do anything to stop it. I nodded a bit too enthusiastically to be cool. Blue-eyes laughed; it sounded like bells. My mind sunk deeper into the fog.\n\nIt didn’t even cross my mind to go find Alex. I forgot about Anna’s frantic worry from just moments before. I let blue-eyes take my hand and lead me further into the house. I felt safe while I was with her. A peace I hadn’t felt since Chel’s death washed over me.\n\nThe next day, as the memories came back to me in flashes, I would realize how... *off* everything was. The whole house had this shimmery glow about it, like something out of a dream.  Alex’s fraternity brothers and the handful of girls from Chel’s sorority drank from seemingly bottomless red Solo cups and danced feverishly in the living room, pressed tightly together in a writhing mass; the rest of the partygoers did shot after shot in the kitchen, a never ending supply of vodka and tequila flowing freely, poured generously by the mysterious Sisters of House Omega. The Sisters themselves, each as stunningly gorgeous as the last, stood around the party’s periphery, laughing easily at the revelry without actually partaking in any of it themselves. All the while, those piercing eyes swept over the party with a calculated, unsettling intensity. \n\nHindsight, of course, is 20\/20. At the time, I was too swept up myself, too enraptured by ocean blue eyes, to notice anything odd.\n\nI wish I could remember her name. Blue-eyes. In spite of everything that happened, I still find myself yearning to know more about her. She pulled me into a cozy bench seat in the corner of the kitchen, away from the worst of the noise. She tucked a stray hair behind my ear with long, graceful fingers, and the whole world fell away. She asked me to tell her all about myself. So I did.\n\nI poured my heart out. I told her about what it was like coming out in high school in a small town in the Midwest, and how supportive Chel always was, even when Alex wigged out and didn’t talk to me for a month. I told her about my dreams of becoming a songwriter and making a break for the coast, about how that dream died with Chel because I couldn’t imagine anybody else singing my songs but her. I told her about all of my hopes and my desires, about my guilt at moving on to live a life that Chel and I had always planned to live together. I told her about my deepest fear: that I don’t know who I am without my twin sister, my other half. That maybe without Chel, I’m nothing at all. \n\nLooking back on it, I can’t remember what blue-eyes actually said to me throughout all of this. She certainly didn’t give away anything about herself, who she was, where she came from - not even her name. But I remember this overwhelming sense of comfort, of her telling me, maybe not in so many words, that I was *somebody*; I was important, I mattered. Even though she didn’t - couldn’t have - known me, somehow she *did*, and she loved me. She held me as I laughed and cried, and it felt like she was laughing and crying with me, feeling everything I felt just as deeply. \n\nThe next part gets even fuzzier. At some point, blue-eyes took my hand and invited me upstairs. Usually this is the part where I lose my cool, especially with a woman so gut-wrenchingly beautiful, but the nerves never came. I felt like I was floating all the way up the stairs, to her room, to the edge of her twin bed. When she finally kissed me and pressed me back into soft sheets, galaxies exploded behind my closed eyes.\n\nIt didn’t go any farther than that, but it was somehow the most intimate experience of my life. I have no idea how long we stayed there, arms around each other, lips sliding together softly, sweetly. At some point, she pulled away to give me another of those deep, searching looks.. She opened her mouth as if to speak when, somewhere in the house, a clock started to chime midnight. \n\nHer head snapped toward the door. She ducked her head and sighed.\n\n“Wait here, Lou.”\n\nI nodded; it wasn’t a question. There was nowhere else I wanted to be. With one last press of her lips to mine, she was gone.\n\nI flopped back onto the bed, idly wondering how long she would be gone and what we might get up to when she got back. Before I could follow that train of thought too far, a high-pitched, harsh shriek rent the night, painfully loud even over the pounding baseline from downstairs. More inhuman, screeching voices soon joined in.\n\nI shot up in bed just as the dance music cut out with the painfully grating sound of feedback from the speakers. There was a series of terrible, thundering crashes, and a chorus of panicked screams sounded from the partygoers below.\n\nThe peaceful veil clouding my thoughts lifted in an instant. It finally caught up to me how *wrong* the situation was. I didn’t even really remember coming upstairs, and I hadn’t seen Alex in hours…\n\n*Shit, Alex is down there.*\n\nI ran to the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Distantly, I thought I could hear Alex screaming my name, scared and in pain, and I started slamming my body into the door, calling out for him until my voice was shredded. I looked around frantically for my phone, but it wasn’t anywhere in the room. I couldn’t remember where I had left it. Footsteps pounded down the hallway outside, a terrified scream coming closer, abruptly silenced when something slammed into the other side of the bedroom door with a wet, heavy thud. I stumbled back until my knees hit the edge of the bed. \n\nI sobbed and made a break for the windows instead. I was just about to take my chances jumping from the second story when a small TV in the corner of the room switched on, static buzzing at the highest volume. Half-wild, I thought briefly of chucking the whole TV through the windowpane before the blurred pixels started to resolve into a familiar face.\n\n“No…”\n\nThere on the TV, impossibly, was Chel. My escape plan was quickly abandoned. I reached out to the screen with shaking fingers, as though I could reach through the cold glass and touch her face. \n\nThe scene on the TV started to play. I couldn’t look away.\n\nChel was at a party in what I recognized as the basement of Alex’s fraternity house. She was trashed, drink sloshing over the rim of her cup onto her sweater. The sweater I was wearing that night. Alex stepped into frame, laughing, and poured more liquor into her cup.\n\n“Easy, Chel, you’re going to lose the rest of your drink!”\n\n“Can’t have that!” whooped a frat brother in the background. Alex turned and shot him a glare.\n\n“When are the other girls gonna get here?” Chel’s voice was slurred, mumbling. “Is Lou still coming?”\n\nA chorus of giggles sounded from the small handful of girls in the background. I recognized Beth\/Stacy as one of the onlookers. Alex looked back at the crowd and swallowed. He smiled wanly at Chel.\n\n“Yeah, Chel, she’s on her way. Listen - how about we play a game while we wait for her?”\n\nMy stomach felt like stone, bile clawing up the back of my throat. Distantly, I could still hear the rampage continuing in the house around me. Wails of pain and fear, shrieks of rage and triumph, and under it all, a thick, fleshy ripping sound. \n\n“A game?” Chel looked at Alex with unfocused eyes, brow furrowed. Something was seriously wrong. Chel never got that drunk.\n\n“Yeah, it’ll be fun!” The men were circling up around Chel on the TV. The hair on my arms and neck stood up. Somebody in the real world was pounding on the door to the room, begging for help, but they sounded distorted and far away, like my head was in a fishbowl. \n\n“I don’t know, Alex, I don’t feel so good.” Chel swayed on her feet. Alex was practically holding her upright. \n\n“It’s OK, Chel, just one quick game and then we’re done, OK?” \n\nAlex was smoothing Chel’s hair away from her face, almost tenderly. The ugly, sinister anticipation in my gut was building. Chel and Alex always had a bit of a thing, but this didn’t seem like their usual flirting; it was a mockery of the sweet way Alex usually treated Chel. His eyes were filled with an odd mix of determination and regret, lust and anxiety.\n\nThe Chel on the TV was too far gone to have any of those same misgivings. Chel was always too trusting of people, quick to see the good in everyone. She smiled broadly and dropped her head onto Alex’s shoulder, wrapping her arms around him in a loose hug. Alex’s frat brothers were circling like sharks. I wrapped my arms around my own waist and fell to my knees, tears streaming down my face.\n\n“Spin the Chel!” somebody yelled. Chel looked up, confused, and Alex grimaced and spun her quickly in a circle. She stumbled into the arms of another fraternity brother. She tried to push at him, but her movements were slow and weak. The guy forcibly kissed her, and then shoved her back toward Alex, who did the same. This continued, Chel tossed about like a ragdoll, sobbing my name in fear and confusion. She looked so lost, so *young*. I quit watching as soon as more hands started grabbing at her, pulling at her clothes. It wasn’t hard to guess what happened next.\n\nI covered my ears and hunched in on myself on the floor, screaming, begging for it all to stop. \n\nI don’t know how long I stayed there. I didn’t even notice that everything had gone quiet until I heard the click of the bedroom door opening behind me. It was loud as a gunshot in the sudden silence. I stood up slowly and moved toward the door in a daze.\n\nI stepped forward and barely registered the sick squelch of the rug under my feet. Red soaked the floor and the bottom 18 inches of the wallpaper, splattered in wide strokes on the upper walls and ceiling. A pile of gore that had once been a person slumped at the top of the stairs. A river of blood ran down the center of the staircase, thick and dark, flowing like a grisly red carpet to the open front door.\n\nI stepped around mangled limbs and stringy viscera as I made my way carefully down the stairs. My mind was completely numb to the carnage; the sound of Chel’s helpless tears still filled my ears. Two steps from the front door, a faint voice gurgled to my left.\n\n“Lou…”\n\nPart of me wanted to ignore him. To just walk back out into the night, down County Road 5, back to my tiny, uncomfortable bed in my shitty dorm room, where I would fall asleep and this would all have been a nightmare. \n\n“Please*,* Lou.”\n\nMovements rigid, I forced myself to turn toward the living room. My breath hitched in spite of my detachment.\n\nThere, on the floor in the middle of a sea of shredded bodies, was what was left of Alex. His blond hair was tinged pink with blood. One of his eyes dangled loosely from its socket; both legs were missing below the knees. He dragged himself toward me with his right arm, nails cracking against the hardwood floor. His left arm, flesh ripped down to bone and sinew, reached out for me, pleading.\n\nI didn’t move. I couldn’t. This was Alex - my best friend since kindergarten, Chel’s prom date, my first and last kiss with a man. This was *Alex*. The man who threw my sister to the wolves. Who raped her. \n\nThe reason Chel was dead. \n\n“Did Chel say *please*, Alex? \n\nAlex choked on a bloody sob. I could see the guilt and shame awash in his one good eye.\n\n“It wasn’t s’posed...go that far.” He coughed; blood spewed in a chunky froth across the hardwood. “*Please*, Lou, ‘m sorry.”\n\nGroaning in agony, Alex inched closer to me. I remained still, body frozen with indecision.\n\n“Shall we spare him?”\n\nIce trickled down my spine. The voice belonged to blue-eyes, there was no doubt, but it was different; a sonorous, echoing whisper, sighing on the wind like it came from everywhere at once.\n\nA long-fingered hand settled on my shoulder. In the corner of my vision, I saw shiny curved, black talons resting near my collarbone. Just around the corners of the living room entryway, beyond my line of sight, I could make out the shadows of huge wings. Feathers rustled, claws tapped and clicked on the hardwood floor, impatient. Alex looked toward the noise, face twisted in fright. Blue-eyes squeezed my shoulder gently.\n\n“I’m sorry, child. You weren’t supposed to be here. But we wanted you to understand.”\n\nAlex looked at me again, pleading. He opened his mouth to speak, but I beat him to it.\n\n“He’s all yours.”\n\nAs whatever monsters lurked in the shadows began to advance, the hand on my shoulder turned me away and steered me toward the door. Smooth, black feathers filled my peripheral vision, a large wing curled around my frame to block the sights and muffle the sounds of my former best friend’s demise. I stepped into the cool night air and closed my eyes. Lips brushed tenderly across my temple. \n\n“Be at peace, dear one.”\n\nEverything went black.\n\nI woke up late last Sunday morning, back in the dorms, tucked safely into my bed. For a couple of hours, I almost convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing. Every trace of the House Omega party has been scrubbed from existence - all of my text messages with Alex about it were gone, none of the sleek, black invitations remained. I thought briefly, hopefully, that maybe it had all just been a grief-induced nightmare.\n\nUntil the news broke that Alex’s entire fraternity and a handful of Chel’s sorority sisters had disappeared into the ether overnight.\n\nThe police have no leads. I know they won’t find any. I drove back out to County Road 5 a few days ago, after half a week of fielding concerned phone calls from my mom. There’s nothing there; just an empty field with an abandoned, decrepit farmhouse rotting in the prairie sun.\n\nAlex’s mom has been calling me, too. To see if I’ve heard from him, if I have any clue what happened. I haven’t told her the truth. I’ve decided that I won’t. Sometimes lies are kinder. She doesn’t need to know what kind of monster her son was, what kind of monster he was killed by.\n\nI spent most of the day today at the cemetery. I sat cross-legged in front of Chel’s headstone, tracing the letters of her name and thinking of everything I should have seen earlier, everything I missed. A shadow fell over me, breaking my reverie. \n\n“Mind if I join you?”\n\nI squinted up into the afternoon sun. It was Anna. With everything else that had been going on, I had almost forgotten that she had even been there that night. I guess I had subconsciously catalogued her as one of missing. Apparently, officially speaking, she was never at the party either.\n\nShe helped fill in some of the gaps.\n\n“Chel came to me, right after it happened,” Anna said, voice tight. She sat down beside me in the grass, close enough our thighs were touching. “I was furious, ready to call campus police, but she begged me not to. The boys, and some of our so-called sisters, had taken video of the whole thing, she said, and threatened to expose her if she got ‘too sensitive’ about it. I promised her I wouldn’t call. I wish every night that I had anyway.\n\nI had decided I would connect her with campus resources instead, you know? Support groups for survivors, counselors, that kind of thing. I convinced myself it was good enough. But before I could make it happen she..” Anna choked on the words. She cleared her throat and breathed out harshly through her nose. “Well, I was too late. I would apologize to you, but an apology isn’t good enough.”\n\n“You have nothing to apologize for, Anna. You tried to help her.” I squeezed her hand. She squeezed mine back.\n\n“Still, I felt like I had to do *something*.” Anna stared at Chel’s headstone, eyes hard. “People like the men and women who hurt your sister, they think they’re invincible. Untouchable. And they’re not entirely wrong these days. With enough money, you can get away with anything, right?” She laughed, dry and humorless. “So I knew I had to reach out to a higher authority.”\n\n“What did you do?”\n\nAnna smiled grimly. “My family worships the old gods.” I shivered at that, a chill dancing across my skin. “I called upon a long-forgotten sisterhood, ancient and hungry. If I could deliver them the guilty parties, they promised they could deliver justice.” Her expression softened as she finally looked at me. “You were never supposed to be there, though. Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry.”\n\nI didn’t tell her it was okay, because it really isn't. But I appreciated her apology nonetheless. I nodded and squeezed her hand again, blinking back tears.\n\n“So...what now?”\n\n“The deed is done.” Anna stood up and dusted the grass off of the back of her leggings. “They’ll have moved on.” Anna looked at me, long and hard, and bit her lip. She nodded to herself, and reached into her purse. “They did ask me to make one last delivery, though.”\n\nAnna pulled out a very familiar piece of black cardstock, embossed with gilded lettering. She handed it to me. I took it with a trembling hand.\n\n“There’s no pressure, and no expiration date,” Anna said. She started to go, but turned back one last time with a sad, sweet smile. “I really am sorry, Lou. For everything. Chel was the best of us.”\n\nI waited until her figure faded into the distance to look down at the paper in my hands. It was a new invitation, to me, this time:\n\n*Louise Teller*  \n*True of heart and strong of will,*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega invite you into our fold.*  \n*A black candle to summon us; a white candle to turn us away.*  \n*We will heed your call.*\n\nI thought of Chel, crying and confused, stumbling in a dark basement. I thought of Chel, the last time I’d seen her in life, head thrown back and laughing. I thought of Chel, cold and still in the ground beneath me. I crumpled the invitation in my fist.\n\nIt’s quiet tonight; not even a breeze rustles the dying leaves. And yet, a soft wind is disturbing the flame of the black candle I’ve placed in front of my open window. A low, sweet voice floats on the breeze, speaking an old language, and feathers flutter in the dark just past my line of vision.\n\nI was never the type to join a sorority. But I think there might be something to this whole sisterhood thing after all."},"260":{"title":"My Husband Brought Home a Fake Daughter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bblq6d\/my_husband_brought_home_a_fake_daughter\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"*This is not my child.*\n\nThat was all I could think. \n\n“Honey?” said my husband. “Is everything all right?”\n\n“Who is this?” I said, staring at the little girl I’d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter’s clothes. “Where is Liza?”\n\nMy husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. \n\n“What do you mean?” said my husband. “Are you feeling all right?”\n\n*Why was he evading my question? Why couldn’t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.\n\n“I’ll be all right,” I said, “as soon as you tell me where my daughter is.”\n\nMy husband frowned, and the little girl’s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \n\n“Go on upstairs, honey,” he said. “Mommy’s not feeling well.”\n\nThe girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter’s room slam. The look on my husband’s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.\n\n“You haven’t been taking your medication,” he said. “Don’t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.”\n\nI waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. \n\n“I don’t need them,” I said. “They make my mind all fuzzy.”\n\nThe anger on my husband’s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. \n\n“Do you remember what happened the last time you said that?” he asked. \n\n“I...”\n\nThe suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.\n\n*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*\n\nI felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.\n\nMy husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.\n\n“Shhh,” he cooed. “It’s not real, honey. I promise that it’s not real.”\n\nI silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. \n\nSoon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. \n\nOf course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn’t me who had been driven insane by our daughter’s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.\n\nBut, most importantly, I knew that if I didn’t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.\n\nJust like he did the last time.\n\n[x](http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"261":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Once the postman had left and I was alone with my thoughts they just continued to get louder. \n\nI thought about Natalia and the cult. About the kids and their nighttime antics. About the committee meeting. Jamie and how much I missed him, Georgia and my burning guilt and Mr Prentice, who was finally making those aforementioned animal noises.\n\nMost of all I thought about the note left for me on move in day. How it had changed everything. My whole life was different now, I was alone and it felt like my new home was attacking from every angle. \n\nI re read the note a few times over my coffee. I worried about my rent, it was tight but manageable. School is currently out in the uk but as a training teacher assigned to a school I still get paid a small amount through the summer. The rent is low and with a second summer job I can just about make it without Jamie. \n\nIt sounds strange. But it felt nice to worry about something normal for a minute; even if I should have been worrying about my survival and the many entities currently trying to kill me. \n\nI didn’t get to stew for too long, I had to get ready for the committee meeting. After the events of the night before and my growing mistrust of prudence it was imperative that I got the neighbours on side if I was going to achieve anything like my goals of eradicating the imposter\/cultist neighbours. \n\nThe meeting was at noon in flat 31, there was a poster on a communal notice board by the entrance that I was glad to spot, Terri hadn’t mentioned the time when we met and all our meetings since had been a bit hectic to discuss it. The poster promised tea and cakes and my stomach rumbled at the thought, I hadn’t eaten properly in days.  \n\nAt 11.55 I left the flat, and wandered out into the corridor. I’d never seen so many neighbours. Mr Prentice, however, was still making that awful noise and I watched in disbelief as every single person in the corridor walked past his door as if it was silent. \n\nI did my usual deliberation on whether to take the stairs or lift but yet again the stairs won. I still couldn’t bear being where Jamie died and all these extra flights were keeping me fit.\n\nFlat 31 belonged to an older lady named Molly Thompson and her husband Eric. She had a blue rinsed head of curls attached to her head and had gone to the effort to make homemade batten-burg cake. Other neighbours had bought along baked goods as well. It reminded me of a school fair.\n\nThe flat itself was decorated for the 70s, with plenty of china cat ornaments littered around. I sat down on a dusty plastic garden chair, one of many that Molly seemed to have acquired and laid out for the residents pouring in. I hadn’t seen community spirit like this in my life. \n\nI smiled as I saw Terri, Eddie and Ellie wander in. It was nice to see some familiar faces. I had noticed people looking at me, wondering who I was. It probably wasn’t often they got new neighbours. Eddie came running up to me, swung his arms round me and sat down in the rickety garden chair next to mine. It was so sweet. Terri smiled at me and took a seat the other side of mine, Ellie sat next to her brother. The brown puppy dog eyes were back. No claws.\n\n“I’m glad you came!” Terri said to me, loud enough to hear over the voices of the other neighbours. “I really want you to see the good side of the block. We don’t bite really!” She laughed nervously as she realised the irony of her statement. \n\n“Terri I need help, we need to stop those people from coming back again and from terrorising people. The block can’t go on like this.” I wanted to make the purpose of my attendance clear to her, it was time for things to change. \n\n“But if you don’t let them in then they don’t bother you. I’ve spoken to the kids, they know not to do it again, that those people are dangerous.” She paused for a moment and sighed. “Although them running away didn’t help, the kids think they’re indestructible now. They’ve been telling me all morning that they’re going to kill the bad guys.” \n\nShe looked so resigned. But it was true, they did run away from the twins. Maybe there was something in that, I knew they could die I just had to work out how. But as the thought crossed my mind and I looked at Eddie and Ellie, I couldn’t imagine taking the risk.\n\nI could’ve flat out gone back and asked Prudence. But to be honest I didn’t want anything to do with her. She gave me such a bad feeling. I was doubting everything she told me.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you can keep them away. We can’t all live in fear. Yours aren’t the only kids in this building.” I knew this from surveying the room. “But I bet not all the kids here are as ... special ... as yours. What if another family burns to death because their kids were hyper one night.”\n\nI could see this struck a chord with Terri. She looked at me with glassy eyes as if on the verge of tears. \n\n“You’re right. Molly’s the chairwoman and she can be a little strict but you can bring it up under any other business.” She spoke with a lump in her throat. “Here you go by the way.” She handed me a piece of printed paper. \n\nAny other business felt a bit lacklustre but it would do. As long as it got discussed. \n\nI turned my attention the the piece of paper, it was the agenda for the meeting. For something written so formally it appeared farcical. It seemed other flats and floors had different but equally strange issues to mine. \n\nThere were only 6 items on the agenda for the meeting with AOB as the 7th. They were as follows. \n\n*1. Welcome and introductions with apologies for absence.*\n\n*2. Replacing of the flickering lights on floor 11, it seems to incite vicious behaviour from the pets and elderly of that floor.*\n\n*3. Serving a formal residents letter of concern to the man who doesn’t move from the bottom of the stairwell on floor 5.*\n\n*4. Finances - budgets for general maintenance and the annual barbecue.*\n\n*5. The stairs with no grip leading up to floor 14 at the very top and the health and safety hazards this presents.*\n\n*6. Soundproofing of Mr Prentice’s flat, number 48.*\n\nI was comforted to know that I wasn’t alone in dealing with all these strange occurrences. I was also chilled to the core to know for certain that it was the entire building that was more than a bit odd. \n\nWhat really struck me as odd is that when I thought about it, I had seen that man on floor 5 when going down the stairs. But I’d never noticed that it had been every time, or that he had never moved, until this moment. \n\nThe meeting begun with a loud and dissatisfying clink. \n\nBy this point the tiny, 70s themed flat was packed. Garden chairs had all ran out and people were standing. Molly Thompson stood up from her floral patterned arm chair and bashed a teaspoon against the outside of her cup. \n\nShe reminded me of a very strict, disciplinarian school teacher I had worked with during my university placement. She commanded quiet in the room. \n\n“I think we should get started everyone!” She shrilled, her voice growing louder with every word until the crowd came to a silent hum.\n\n“Right, firstly, we are not going to skip the introductions today. Apologies have been given by Jo and Steph of flat 2 and yet again by Mr Prentice. We have a new face in the room as I’m sure many of you have noticed.” She gestured to me and looked in my direction but didn’t really make any eye contact. She was just talking about me as I sat in the room. Eventually she addressed me directly. \n\n“Stand up dear, introduce yourself. We’re pleased to have you here.”\n\nI was deeply uncomfortable. I could feel some sort of panic coming on. I never liked standing in crowds very much. But I stood up anyway. \n\n“Ermm, hi. My name is Kat. I live in flat number 42, I moved in with my boyfriend Jamie but he was killed in the lift by the weird rat creatures you people have living here. The people that claim to live in the burned out flats won’t leave me alone and one in particular seems to want me dead. Oh, and that window cleaner outside my flat makes me want to scoop my own eyes out with a spoon every time he knocks on the door. Nice to meet you all.” The crowd had gasped a little.\n\nI sat down. Instantly mortified, I don’t know what happened, the normality and structure of the meeting overwhelmed me. There’s something about a sense of order and normality amongst chaos. It does something to your brain, and for me, for the first time in this whole journey, it sent me into a meltdown. \n\nI sobbed as I hit the chair, both in pure mental exhaustion and disappointment that I had blown my chance at building any sort of army against Natalia. Terri rubbed my shoulder. Molly broke the awkward silence that had blanketed the room. \n\n“Nice to meet you Katherine, I understand life in this building can be a little overwhelming. We did ask the previous occupant to let us intervene when you moved in but she was insistent. In hindsight we may need to review our policies on new tenants. I am so very sorry for the loss of your partner. The lift is a most unfortunate situation.”\n\nShe had been in positions of power in her life for certain, she responded professionally but coldly, there was no feeling in her condolences. She came off like a corrupt politician digging themselves out of a hole. She did decide to skip the introductions after my outburst.\n\nI also hate it when I’m called Katherine. My parents named me Katie and I shorten it to Kat. Her presuming it was Katherine added to her school teacher demeanour. \n\nShe carried on with the proceedings pretty swiftly and interesting characters present at the meeting started to emerge. \n\nMy favourite was a large middle aged Caribbean woman named Precious St Fluer who would not accept Molly’s claims that there was not enough in the budget to replace the lighting on floor 11.  \n\nShe got up and lifted her shirt to reveal a large deep bite mark across her stomach caused by her dog after a long episode of the lights flickering. When that didn’t change Molly’s answer she lifted her trouser leg to reveal a smaller, but still noteworthy bite mark on her leg, from her elderly mother who lives with her. Molly didn’t budge.\n\nIt took what felt like an eternity to get to any other business. If I weren’t so focused on my goal I would have enjoyed hearing about the quirks of the other floors, maybe tried to engage a little, but I just couldn’t concentrate. \n\nWhen the chairwoman asked if anyone had any other business she scanned the room quickly. I stood up from my chair and she locked in on me with her eyes. \n\nMy hands were shaking and I could feel a cold sweat forming all over my body.\n\n“Katherine, what can we help you with dear?” She asked in a patronising tone. \n\n“I want help in getting rid of the people pretending to be from the burned out flats. I can’t be the only person that doesn’t like living in fear.” I stated boldly, trying not to break down again.\n\n“Dear we have had this discussion multiple times and it’s been taken off the agenda. I am aware you’re new here but there is nothing we can do about certain problems within this building and for this particular issue we would appreciate you not letting them into your home and ignoring them like the rest of us.” She snapped back. \n\n“But that’s not good enough! Terri’s kids answered the door last night, they’re children, it’s easily done, what if someone else’s child does it and aren’t so lucky to survive. One burned my friend so bad a few nights ago that she’s still unconscious in hospital.” This I knew from social media. \n\nA few people called out in agreement with me from the crowd. \n\n“The only one who has ever been able to deal with them is Prudence. And that difficult woman never revealed her methods. Don’t think we didn’t try. You’re suggesting a suicide mission. You’d do well to remember you are new here.” Molly hissed through her teeth. \n\nDid she have to mention I was new so many times. It was grating on me. \n\n“Well I’m willing!” Shouted Precious. She seemed stronger than the rest in her earlier rant. I was glad to have her on side. \n\nWhere she came forward, a few others followed. Soon I had 5 people plus myself willing to form a sub committee to get rid of the cultists. Molly didn’t like it but she agreed to let us do it.\n\nThere was me, Precious and Terri along with lady named Shanti who lived a few doors from me. \n\nA man named Anton and his friend Leo from floor 8 made up the group. To be honest they just seemed keen to get involved with any kind of battle. Leo was the loud one, Anton was mostly silent. \n\nI invited them to my flat after Molly swiftly adjourned the meeting. Inviting anyone into my home made me anxious now. I found myself studying each of their faces to ensure they’re weren’t too average and I hadn’t invited the wrong people in. I was fairly certain I hadn’t. Eddie and Ellie settled in front of my tv in the bedroom so they didn’t hear our conversation. They may only be kids but I felt safer with them there. \n\nWe discussed for hours how we could bring the imposter people into one place and kill them all. \n\nLeo was particularly creative, he came up with weird and whacky ways to end them; from locking them in a room and blasting with fire extinguishers until they freeze, to herding them into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am.\n\nThe whole time I waited nervously for a knock on the door, for them to come for us. But they didn’t. We got time to plan. But despite the time it never really took off, no idea seemed feasible. \n\nI shared everything I knew. My conversation with Prue, the night before in Terri’s flat... everything. Precious listened to my tales intently before speaking.\n\n“Derek would have helped us. He was a great man, he used to turn up at my door in the dead of the night just as those lights started and take my dog for a walk.” She spoke of the gardener with a fondness. \n\n“Prudence told me about Derek. She said he’s been gone since the garden was demolished.” I replied flatly. \n\n“It was awful when he left. That woman that used to live here was nasty to him. I watched out my window as she tore up the garden. I know she was grieving for that little girl but I know Derek only ever wanted to help.” Shanti spoke up from the corner. She had been pretty quiet the whole time. “He was the whole reason we don’t have those awful creatures from the lift all over our homes anymore. My brother was killed by one before the agreement. He was 4 years old.”\n\nI twitched as she told her story. Shanti has such sad eyes and speaking about her brother only filled them further with sadness.\n\n“This is another thing I don’t understand. Why have any agreement, if you managed to kill most of them, why not all?” I asked, feeling anger over Jamie burn through my throat as I spoke. \n\nPrecious laughed. Terri shot her a look from across the room. \n\n“No ones told you the whole story have they?” Shanti asked, a single tear running down her face. \n\n“What do you mean?” This was driving me insane, nothing was simple, how could I trust anyone. \n\n“When Prudence and some of the others killed the creatures they killed a large group of them in one hit. They had started to work out that food scraps and pet food were attracting them and they gathered all the pet food in the tower block into one empty flat on the floor the fire had happened. They creatures came in droves just like expected and they set the flat alight. Again.\n\n“The flat was burned to ash on top of preexisting ash. Nothing could survive that.” Shanti was interrupted after this by Leo. \n\n“And then 3 giant rat motherfuckers literally rose from the ashes, triple as smart and strong and fucked shit up!” He said, a look of excitement on his face. \n\nShanti rolled her eyes and continued. “So all Prudence did was cause a quite literally bigger problem. She didn’t kill them, all she did was help them evolve.\n\n“There was only three of them but they learned to sneak attack. More people died than during the original infestation. They were more intelligent but not in the way it comes across when the agreements spoken about. We couldn’t speak to or reason with them.”\n\nTerri was looking at the floor. \n\n“Only Derek was able to do that, he spoke to them like he spoke to the garden. He made it safe for everyone again, I wasn’t there. I was too young but there we were told he didn’t even have to use words. They understood just a series of movements and eye contact. \n\n“Derek explained the rule with the lift. He told us it was a gesture of goodwill. The creatures needed a home and seemed attracted to the building and we would let them live there and stop killing their kind if they would stop killing ours. But to show them some respect we would allow them a small time frame where unleash their instinctual nature. But only if someone came to them.\n\n“There are only 2 left now. Prudence killed the other during what happened with her granddaughter. But that only made them 2 stronger. Like they absorbed the 3rd.” \n\nI tried to take in all the information I was receiving but I couldn’t. It was too much. \n\n“Derek isn’t coming back, it’s been years, this is pointless!” Terri finally erupted. Precious laughed again.\n\n“How do you know?! You speak to dear old Prue all the time, know something we don’t?” Precious spoke sarcastically but I think she meant what she said. It was becoming clear that Prudence Hemmings wasn’t too popular in this building. \n\n“I don’t speak to her all the time! We just keep in contact, she was always nice to me!” Terri tried weakly to defend herself.\n\n“That’s because you’re naive and a pushover! She used you because no one else would give her the time of day!” Precious was about to launch into a full rant on Terri. I was glad Eddie and Ellie were in the other room and couldn’t hear. I wondered if she’d seen them at night. \n\nI decided to stop the rant. This was becoming counter productive and we were getting nowhere with our plans. I interjected and told them all I needed them to leave so that I could sleep. Partly true, although I knew I couldn’t sleep. I had other things to do. \n\nThey all filed out of my flat, Terri and the kids were the last to leave. She gave me a hug as she left and told me to get a proper nights rest, telling me she was always there for a cuppa and a chat. It was sweet. I felt sorry for Terri. The kids hugged me too as they left. \n\nI know she spoke to Prue, but I was certain that it really was entirely innocent. \n\nI sat in the empty flat disheartened that my assembling of an army had turned into a bickering shit show with no real suggestions on how to kill the imposter neighbours. \n\nI felt totally alone. I couldn’t trust Prue or Ian or pretty much anything I thought I knew. Maybe Prue didn’t even kill those neighbours. They only told me half truths about the creatures after all. \n\nI was left alone with my thoughts again. And after a few hours, a good one finally struck me, but I needed supplies.\n\nI left the building and went to the nearest shop to gather the items I needed. For what I needed and the time of night I had to travel to a 24 hour supermarket. It took half hour each way on the bus. But I stayed focused. My bags were heavy and awkward on the way back to the block but if it paid off this was going to be worth it. \n\nI trudged up the stairs. It took me 2 trips and 24 flights of stairs instead of 14 to get everything in my flat and organise myself. \n\nIt only took 16 and a large gym bag that was much easier to carry on the way back down, thankfully. \n\nI passed the man on floor 5 twice. Now I’d noticed him, he made my skin crawl a little. \n\nI walked through the downstairs corridor, diverting away from the main entrance and passing all the ground floor flats to the door at the back of the building.\n\nThe door at the back lead to a small concrete area with a grass strip along the side and a bench decorated with a memorial plaque. This was the blocks outside space. As is typical in the city the whole bench was covered in graffiti. The memorial was unreadable. \n\nI got to work. I dug the strip of grass, turning soil with my new equipment. I had never been green fingered and to be honest the shrubs I had bought had been so heavy I had grown to resent them a little. I worked for an hour and a half. I was sweating and night had come, it was pitch black and I was using my phone torch to see. \n\nI had almost given up until I got up from my crouching position to stretch my knees. I reached my arms out, put down my shovel and took a seat on the bench. \n\nI hadn’t seen him arrive but the man was already sat there. He wore a flat cap and a jacket, despite it being the middle of summer and a beautiful night. He just smiled warmly at the shrubs for a moment without a word. Eventually he spoke. \n\n“I’ve missed this place. Names Derek.”\n\nOur journey: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/clvga9\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"262":{"title":"I was in prison for 15 years. There was a skinwalker in there with us.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/e1eyok\/i_was_in_prison_for_15_years_there_was_a\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"A little background first. I was serving a 15-year sentence in a penitentiary in southern Arizona. What I was in there for isn't important. During my stay there, there were countless things that happened that no one could explain, and even more that no one wanted to know more about. \n\nIt all started with a prison legend. Supposedly, years ago something awful and unexplainable happened in the prison. Every morning we'd be woken up, and expected to stand near the front of our cells while guards visually confirmed we were present and accounted for. Apparently about a year before I got sent there, the most brutal and unexplainable thing happened during one of these routines. A man who had a cell to himself looked very off during this check. When a guard pulled over another guard to help him check it out, they found it wasn't actually the prisoner they were expecting at  all. It was a totally different man. This man, was wearing the skin of the other man over him. Loosely fitting, draped over him, apparently looked like a real monster. The scariest things were though, was the guy wearing the skin was NOT an inmate. They had no idea how he even got into prison, let alone a cell. Whats worse is that they couldn't even figure out who the hell he was. He wasn't documented anywhere. And whats worse than that? They never even found the body of the man of the skin he was wearing.\n\nPretty grisely stuff, I know. And I realize that's not the go-to definition of a skinwalker, but that's what the prison called him. The Skinwalker. Didn't help that the guy never talked apparently. Anyway, thats what started the whole skinwalker superstition around the yard. Apparently the guy got shipped to a different spot about a month after it happened, and just about everyone in genpop felt all the better for it. I heard about the story on the second day of my stay. Hell of a story to hear to place in your home for the forseeable future.\n\nNow onto the real shit though. Sure, that guy was The Skinwalker, but all he did in the long run was get an old lifer Navajo inmate to tell everyone about actual skinwalkers. It seemed like a lot of the prison culture actually revolved around them. \n\nNow, apparently, skinwalkers are tricky to point out on the spot, but if you manage to survive around one for more than a minute or two, almost everyone can tell the mannerisms are all off. They can mimic human speech but not replicate it. They twitch manically. They have an unnatural gait while walking. But apparently they got better with experience. The old Navajo guy - his name was Carl - said that he was sure there was an actual one among the prisoners. Slowly picking us off over the years. He called it \"The Grandmaster Skinwalker\" at one point. Apparently he thought it had human mannerisms down so well that you might not even be able to tell if it was your cellmate for a day or two. It had to be good he posited one night. He would expect a skinwalker to jump at any opprtunity for a kill. But this one realized it had a revolving door of people to kill coming to it, and masterfully bided its time, as Carl thought, for years.\n\nA lot of guys found humor in it. A lot more were really on edge about it. Every once in a while in prison, people snap. Sometimes you'll find your cellmate swinging in front of your bunk, strung up around the neck by his pant leg. Sometimes you just can't take it anymore. But in our yard, people tended to snap in a very special way. It wouldn't be an outburst at dinner, or a silent suicide in the night. Guys would just stop talking. Hunch over and shuffle around. Any friendships they had would be mostly out the window. They would turn into a loner during rec time, they would let their hair hang in front if their face. \n\nNo one liked to talk about it. Like if they did, it would happen to them next. I felt the same way. I didn't know if it was a skinwalker, or just people going crazy. But I didn't want to find out. It wasn't clockwork or anything, but every time someone snapped in this way, it wasn't more than a couple weeks before they were \"shipped off\" or \"transferred\" to God knows where without anyone else knowing beforehand.\n\nThen there was the nighttime occurances. Short, loud bursts of sound echoed through my cell block during all hours of the night on a regular basis. It sounded like a mix between a pigs dying squeels and nails on a chalkboard. Just another thing no one liked to talk about. Even scarier were the shadows and footsteps. The block was dimly illumanted in the night by a few lights hanging from the ceiling outside the cells. I myself saw shadows flit across my walls on a regular occasion, when there were definitely no guards near my cell. One time near the end of my sentence, I woke up, looked at my back wall and found a perfect silohuette of a person standing there, but when I looked, my bunkmate was asleep, and no one was outside my cell.\n\nAnd the footsteps. Everyone hated the fuckin footsteps. They were the scariest part. In the night, sometimes, more rarely than the shadows, you would hear ungodly fast footsteps. They sounded like wet feet slapping on tile floor. Whatver caused them would fly from one end of the block to the other in a dead sprint. Whatever it was, it was inhumanely fast. If you happened to be awake before it started, by the time you heard the footsteps on one side of your cell and whipped your head around to see the thing run by, it sounded like it was 3 cells past you. Everyone hated the footsteps. I agreed, I thought they were the worst.\n\nI was released from that place about a month ago, and I have more stories than I can count. I swear it was nearly my turn. About a week before I was discharged, my cellmate, and a good friend of mine \"snapped\". In the same kinda way. I didn't sleep for an entire week. Well I did sleep of course but never for more than a few minutes at a time. Never turned my back on the guy. The scariest thing? I woke up one night to him somehow snaking his body through the bars of our cell. For reference, I couldn't get anything past my shoulder through them. The worst part though, he was coming back in to our cell. \n\nOn the day of my release I didn't say a word to him. Just left. He seemed fine with it, so, so was I. I had made it through, 15 years of prison fights, gang disputes and for all I know, skinwalker abductions. I left through the front gates, a free man. As I walked along the fence for the rec yard, I spotted my cellmate, standing off on his own, like he had for the last week or so. I shook my head, not even really sure if it was him anymore. I took one last look over the yard, this time from the other side of the fence. I wish I hadn't.\n\nThere, standing off on his own, on the other side of the yard, was Carl. Slouched over, eyeing the other inmates, and twitching manically."},"263":{"title":"My son asked me to check the closet for monsters.

It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside.\n\n\nHe was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn’t surprising given the circumstances.\n\n\nHe’s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he’s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age.\n\n\nAnd you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you’re sleeping in a new environment, right?\n\n\nThat’s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke.\n\n\nIt was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought.\n\n\nBut something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request.\n\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\nI turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.\n\n\nWhen you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm’s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them.\n\n\nThat’s why I didn’t freak out. I couldn’t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing:\n\n\nWe had to leave the room.\n\n\nWe had to leave the house *immediately*.\n\n\n“Alright champ, of course” I said, faking bravery.\n\n\nThen I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him:\n\n\n“Hey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there’s a monster in there, I’ll have to kick its *BUTT* all over your room!”\n\n\nHe chuckled and said “*okay*”.\n\n\nI made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word “*butt*” because it’s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster.\n\n\nAs soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out.\n\n\nWhen I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go.\n\n\nI jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute.\n\n\nI told him I couldn’t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked “*celebrate what*”, to which I replied “*just us two together, I love you buddy.*”\n\n\nIt was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn’t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home.\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I’d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn’t.\n\n\nAnd I know his room didn’t have a closet."},"264":{"title":"I saw something on the evening news that I can't explain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9418eh\/i_saw_something_on_the_evening_news_that_i_cant\/","flair":null,"author":"OQS","selftext":"My work friends and I were out at our favourite pub last night. Not a really fancy place but, you know, cheap beer and close enough to home that I don't have to drive. The night started out normally enough, the four of us crammed into a small table off in the corner, mostly talking shop and shitting on our boss. Being this was the middle of the week there weren't too many other people around, maybe around eight or nine others in the whole place. Everybody just kinda keeping to themselves, sorta people you'd expect to see in a pub on a Wednesday.\n\nAnyway, from where I'm sitting I have a pretty good view of the TV behind the bar. Jessie the bartender is kinda lazily flipping through channels and passes by our local news channel. There's a brief burst of orange and red on the screen which I register as a fire happening somewhere, which then disappears as Jessie switches over to the next channel. Something about the image looks oddly familiar though.\n\n\"Hey Jess, can you switch that back?\" I call out to her.\n\nThe news comes back on, and suddenly I recognize the building in the frame. It's *my* building, and it's burning.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I say, loudly enough that a few people follow my gaze to the television. \"That's my apartment!\"\n\nThe crowd in the bar falls kinda quiet, everybody staring up at the screen now. The screen shows a wide shot of the outside of my building. The camera must be set up on the north end of the block because I recognize a lot of shops on the ground floor - property management, dry cleaner, convenience mart, etc. The top left corner of the building is aflame. It's not a huge fire by any means, but it looks like a few units between the top four floors or so have already been engulfed by the flames. \n\n\"Jesus, man,\" one of my coworkers says. \"That, uh...that sucks.\" There's an uncomfortable murmur of agreement that passes around the table. I mean, I don't blame them, I wouldn't know what to say in this situation either. \"Yup,\" I agree, just as awkwardly. Thankfully, my apartment is only about half way up and located on the west side of the building. I  cross my fingers, hoping my stuff will be okay.\n\nThe camera cuts to a reporter on the scene. He's standing a little further away; looking at the shops in the background I can tell he's across the street on the north-west corner of the building. \"Fire fighters are expected on the scene any moment,\" he's saying, \"and hopefully they'll be able to contain this horrible inferno before it spreads any further. As I was saying before, it's very fortunate that everyone was able to evacuate the building before things got too bad, or who knows what tragic events may have unfolded.\"\n\n\"He's really laying it on thick,\" my other coworkers jokes. I chuckle a bit. All things considered, at the moment it really didn't seem all that bad.\n\nBut then, a few moments later: \"Uh...hang on,\" the reporter on TV says, \"We're getting some updated information. It seems...hang on one moment, while we readjust the camera.\" The previously locked down camera starts to shift, the angle focusing on an area of the building about half way up the west side. All the lights in the building are out except for one. I feel a weird creeping sensation as I start counting the windows from the bottom.\n\nFive up, two over. That's my place. *I swore I turned that light out,* I think at first. Then I see it.\n\nThere's a...person, standing in my window. The camera is zoomed out too far to make out any features, but it definitely looks like a man and it's definitely standing in my apartment. I watch petrified as the camera zooms in closer, the reporter babbling on about \"the overlooked, ill fated soul still trapped in the blazing such and such.\" As the image gets closer, I start to make out more details.\n\nThe person is...dancing. Or something. I don't really know how to describe it, but he's moving around a lot, and everything he's doing has this bizarre rhythmic quality to it. He starts waving his arms in the air, back and forth, back and forth, and then he's waving them up and down at his sides. Then he's banging both fists on the glass. Then he's waving his arms over his head again, back and forth. Everything he's doing is to the exact same tempo. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. He starts jumping up and down, waving his arms over his head like he's trying to get someone's attention from a long distance, but everything is to the exact same rhythm. Over and over again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\"What in the fuck,\" I say, my voice a hoarse whisper. And then the camera gets a little closer, and finally we can make out the person's features. \n\nIt looks almost exactly like me. It's wearing the exact same clothes that I'm wearing now, clothes I changed into moments before leaving the apartment earlier. Its face looks almost exactly like mine as well, except for its eyes. Its eyes are far too big for a normal person. It also has this almost comical look of horror on its face...I don't even know how to describe it. Imagine if someone were pretending to look scared, but as a joke. It would have almost seemed funny if the circumstances were different, but instead it was just extremely unnerving.\n\nNo one in the bar is talking now. Everyone is fixed on the TV. The \"person\" is still swaying and waving around, beating its hands on the glass or jumping in circles. I almost don't hear the reporter mention the fact that firefighters have rushed into the building and are now heading for my floor. *Oh god,* I think, without really understanding what was happening. *Please don't go in there.*\n\nI stare transfixed at the screen. From this angle you can just barely see the top of my front door through the window, not too far behind where this creature is flailing around. Right now it is holding it's face in his hands and shaking it's head from side to side as if saying no. Suddenly the door behind it bursts open as, presumably, the firefighters have entered my apartment. \n\nThe creature stops moving. For a second, I see its expression change. The comical look of horror is gone, replaced by a huge smile filled with enormous, pointed teeth. Then the lights go out.\n\nWe all just sat there, staring at the screen as the camera slowly zoomed out from the now dark window. No one says anything as we all quietly pay our bill and leave. I went directly to my sister's place across town and asked to stay with her. I told her there was a fire at my apartment and that's it. When I tried to find footage from the news online later that night, it seemed like they had edited that last part out.\n\nI don't know if any of you on this subreddit know what that thing was, but I hope they didn't put out that fire. I hope they let the whole fucking place burn to the ground."},"265":{"title":"Mr. Lakavote","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/82183q\/mr_lakavote\/","flair":null,"author":"nocturnalnanny","selftext":"I’m not sure if this will help anyone, but if my story saves even one person from the nightmares I now endure, I will consider it a win. I have borrowed a phone that was smuggled in here, and the orderly, that now monitors every move I make will be coming shortly, so I must be brief. \n\nA few days ago, I was laying in bed scrolling through Reddit, like I always do to make myself sleepy, when I came across this story that sent shivers up my spine. \n\nAfter I was done reading, I thought to myself, “wow, that was terrifying,” and then scrolled to the next one. Big mistake. \n\nTwenty minutes later, I heard a scratching noise coming from my bedroom door and I froze. Confused, as I live alone, I turned on the lamp next to me and looked towards my bedroom door. \n \n*silence.*\n\nAfter a moment, I decided it was my mind playing tricks on me. After all, I was reading scary stories in the dark. Probably not the best thing to do before bed, but hey, who doesn’t love a good spine-chilling story before they close their eyes. \n\nI went back to scrolling through r\/nosleep when again, I heard a long scratch on the door. I slowly got out of bed and tip-toed over to the noise. Grabbing the door handle, I gently opened it and peeked into my living room, only to find it vacant.\n\nI quietly closed the door and turned to walk back towards my bed, when my closet door flew open! Now, I don’t know about you guys, but when it comes to fight or flight reaction, I seem to choose the option that leaves you frozen in place with your eyes closed. A defense mechanism instilled in me from childhood and stories of the boogeyman. \n\nAfter a moment, I decided to open my eyes and cautiously look towards my closet. I physically heard the clock that was placed on my night stand stop ticking, and that’s when I met him. \n\nHe was almost 8 feet tall, standing on long spiny looking legs, with impossibly long arms that seemed to stretch on forever. What I could see of his body looked to be covered in deep dark cracks. He was wearing a long hooded cloak that touched the floor, as black as midnight on a moonless night, that slightly revealed his ruby red eyes. \n\nWh- who are you? I said with a shaky voice.\n\nHe never physically moved his mouth, but I heard him speak into my soul with the most sinister voice, “I am Mr. Lakavote and I am here to right your wrong.”\n\nPetrified, frozen in place, I tried to ask him what wrong I had done, but before I could finish he was right in front of me. His breath smelled of rotting flesh and death itself as he breathed down my face. \n\nHe reached out and ran his long boney fingers across my cheek, and instantly I knew what he could do. I felt my eyes being ripped from my head and the burning sensation that followed. I began to scream, but no sound came out. I was stuck in my own personal hell as darkness surrounded me. Alone and afraid. I wanted to die. I wanted the agony to end.\n\nAgain, I heard his voice as if it were my own thoughts, “I am the keeper of votesss, you know what you did. You will right your wrong or I will take your eyesssss, along with your eternal soul. You have 24 hoursss.” \n\nJust as fast as he had appeared, Mr. Lakavote had vanished. \n\nI did not sleep the rest of the night. I had visions of the horror, I had just endured that left me sweating and cold at the same time. Had I dreamt the whole thing? Could my mind even make up something so sinister and evil? And the pain, oh Lord the pain I felt, I have never experienced anything close to that kind of suffering in my entire life.   \n\nThe next morning, pacing my apartment, I tried my hardest to think of what I had done wrong. Did I forget to vote in our recent election? Had I missed an employee poll at work? What the hell had I not voted on that was so important that my soul depended on it? \n\nTrying to clear my head, I decided to open Reddit, as it always seemed to make me feel better and relaxed. While I was scrolling, I passed the story I had read the night before. The one that had made the hair on the back of my neck stand. \n\nThat’s when it clicked. I had scrolled to the next one before I gave that story the upvote it deserved. Instantaneously, I clicked on the up arrow and waited, hoping with every part of my being that, that was the answer. Was I playing a guessing game with my life? \n\nI waited the whole day, I didn’t eat, I didn’t move, I barely even breathed. I thought about writing to my family and sorting my goodbyes out but, I felt too incredibly empty to conjure up the words. No one would believe me anyways. \n\nAs the sun slowly set, I decided I might as well wait in my room and hope that I had redeemed myself, or possibly chance losing my eyes and my soul. The thought of that alone made me vomit into the trash can next to my bed and tremble violently with deep, petrifying terror. \n\nWhen my 24 hour mark finally came, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and waited. Prayed. Begged, that my soul would be saved and all would be forgiven. \n\n*silence*\n\nThen, I heard the breathing, I smelled the rotting flesh, I felt all the hair on my body raise. When I finally opened my eyes, I felt a chill that froze me to the bone, as if I was sitting inside a freezer meant for the dead. There he was, right in front of me. His eyes had turned to sapphires as he stared into my soul. \n\n“Don’t let it happen again”, he bellowed in a voice that to this day still haunts my dreams. Then he was gone. \n\nI know some of you won’t believe me. Hell, I’m not even sure if I believe myself. As the doctor here says, “it’s all in my head”. But, for the love of your eyeballs and your soul... do ***NOT*** forget to vote while you are reading stories on Reddit, or you too will have the “pleasure” of meeting Mr. Lakavote for yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"266":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I felt no pain at all from the burn on my face, everything was numb. The relief of eradicating the imposter neighbours and the joy at finding a friend in Derek was hacked away in an instant. Just like every leaf from my shrubs. Why would she do this? What had I ever done to her? \n\nEvery question possible crossed my mind. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside me, everything about this place just threw up question after question and for every answer I got, there were ten new questions waiting to be asked. At that moment in time though, only one was truly important. \n\nHow did Prudence know? \n\nI thought about Terri and her telephone conversations. I didn’t want to think that the sweet lady I thought Terri had turned out to be would do that, but it did cross my mind. I thought of Ian the postman, I’d had bad vibes from him for a while, maybe he’d seen Derek coming up the stairs while on his rounds that morning.\n\nI stood there frozen pondering all these things until I saw Prudence collapse onto the memorial bench sobbing, head in her hands. She was surrounded by the remains of my attempt at a garden with the shears laid out on the floor. \n\nThe stairs were kind to me on the way down, it took 4 flights to make it to the bottom. I ran down the corridor and out the back entrance of the block, no idea what I was going to say. \n\n“Prudence!” Was all I could manage. Nice one, Kat.\n\nShe sat bolt upright before turning and standing quicker than I thought it possible for an old lady. \n\n“You evil, stupid little girl! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” She screamed, so much animation in her face that the spaces between her wrinkles pulsated like veins on an angry weightlifter. \n\n“Me?! You think I’m evil! You left that shitty note hidden, missing everything I need to know and got my boyfriend killed! And what you’re doing to your own -“ I screamed, tears beginning to roll, before she interrupted me. \n\n“Don’t you dare talk about her!” Her voice cracked and she broke down again, this time falling to her knees, twigs and leaves sticking to the bottom of her dress. \n\nI didn’t know what else to do. So I sat down on the floor. I knew that it was probably a bad idea, this woman couldn’t be trusted and I hadn’t forgotten that, but seeing an old lady crying on the cement floor still made me feel awful.\n\n“How did you know about the garden?” I asked her calmly, trying to change my approach. \n\nShe shoved a crumpled up piece of paper into my hand, she didn’t look at me, her eyes remained on the floor. \n\n*Dear Prudence,*\n\n*I couldn’t exist knowing what I’d done.*\n\n*I should never have told you about it.*\n\n*The last two won’t grow stronger, she was never theirs to begin with. But I have to end her suffering.*\n\n*I’m sorry.*\n\n*Derek*\n\nI knew what he had done as soon as I finished the note. Lyla, or what was left of her, was gone for good. Of all the creatures only Jamie’s killers from the lift remained. That’s how Derek had spent the few hours I’d slept between our encounters. \n\n“This is all your fault.” She sniffed. “My whole family are gone because of you.”\n\nThat hurt a lot. I trembled as I tried to speak but I always really hated confrontation and I could feel myself starting to glitch. \n\n“H..how can you say that! I saw... her and she was trapped in a tiny cage eating dog food and small animals. Your family died in that lift. Just like my Jamie.” I may have struggled to get my words out, but I wasn’t about to let Prudence Hemmings blame me for her decisions. Lyla was better off dead than what she was, however awful that may sound. \n\n“What happened to your face?” Prudence growled at me. “Take you to visit floor number 9? He did this to her in the first place, not me! And now he’s disfigured you!” She was spinning things. I could feel throbbing as she mentioned my face, I really should have had medical attention. \n\n“This isn’t his fault! You messed him up and he did that to her because of you! You told me that yourself.” I tried ferociously to defend Derek but something inside me still felt uncomfortable about what he had done. I couldn’t help it, Lyla was an innocent little girl who shouldn’t have been punished for Prue’s mistakes. This whole thing was such a mess.\n\n“I was grieving! And then I had her back for all those years, and then I lost Bernie, and then my home and now I have to grieve for her all over again.” Prudence continued to cry, but softer. I looked around at the chaos she created and up at the block my boyfriend had died in and rolled my eyes in disbelief that she could be so selfish. She continued.\n\n“Let me tell you about Lyla. She was a beautiful little girl. As I mentioned before, I have two other older children, they’ve had many other grandchildren, however I hadn’t spoken to my eldest two in years even before what happened with Lyla. \n\n“Lyla was my first opportunity to get to know one of my grandchildren. Bernie adored her too, always reading her stories and sneaking her sweets. \n\n“I begged my son to allow her to stay. My children were all incredibly ungrateful, they had it easy growing up and still resented me. I gave them a good, strict upbringing but they didn’t appreciate it. They said I was a cruel mother. Lyla’s dad was the only one I spoke to, but our relationship still wasn’t that of a typical loving mother and son. But she was a second chance. \n\n“It was a miracle when he agreed. I was more shocked he had convinced his wife to allow it. That awful harlot of a woman never liked me, although I didn’t like her either. \n\n“They refused to speak to me after everything, I haven’t heard from them since. They had more grandchildren I’ll never meet. I knew at the time my relationships with any of my children were over for good. So when Derek gave me a solution I took it.\n\n“I wasn’t entirely truthful when we first spoke. I said I hadn’t wanted this, but I was desperate. There was never a way to bring her back safely. Derek explained what she would become to me. He was initially trying to put me off even trying to get her back. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. \n\nBut I couldn’t pass up the idea of my beautiful little Lyla, needing her grandma forever. I suppose I was too ashamed to admit it before. But why should I be ashamed?\n\n“My altercation with Derek happened after she was back, when he tried to kill her the first time. Spouting the same things on that note, what kind of monster wants to kill a little girl? That’s why I trashed the garden. He said he wasn’t coping with the news of the new block when he suggested it, that he shouldn’t have told me it was even possible and she had to die. I hid her until the bulldozers came in. \n\n“When he disappeared I thought I was safe to spend the rest of my life with her. \n\n“Bernie hated me. Spending time with Lyla was all I lived for, I grew to love her how she was.”\n\nI felt sick. Listening to Prudence talk bought up so many repressed feelings about Jamie. I hadn’t had time to grieve or process anything, I missed him terribly. My old life and my old future felt a million miles away.\n\nI was relieved to know that Derek hadn’t tricked Prudence, or even intended to create rat-Lyla. He was truly good.\n\n“But she didn’t get to have a life. You lived for her but she wasn’t really living. How could a sane person do that to their own flesh and blood?” I retorted.\n\n“You have no idea. This place can make you do irrational things! But she had a life! She had me. It’s all she needed.” She was certainly right about the building and irrational actions, the pain intensifying on my face throbbed in agreement. But I was still convinced she had lost it Dr Frankenstein style where rat-Lyla was concerned. \n\nShe had stopped crying. Her rage levels were rising again. I tried to tell her that it wasn’t really the child she’d known, but she seemed to have grown an entirely new attachment to the creature that replaced what she lost. \n\nEvery rational argument I gave was met with increasing levels of screaming. She got less coherent as she went on. The argument was going nowhere, we went back and forth for what felt like forever.\n\nAfter a while she started to get closer to me. We had both stood up by this point and despite her haggard and frail appearance, Prudence was truly frightening. She looked unhinged. \n\nHer words were no longer going in, I was overwhelmed and had too many thoughts rushing through my mind to process her ranting. I took a few steps back clearing a small distance between us. \n\nBy this point, out of the corner of my eye, I could see neighbours in windows of the block, watching the altercation outside, Prue’s screaming had bought a lot of attention. It was bright and I couldn’t see well but I turned to scan the windows and did recognise Eddie and Ellie watching from their bedroom, trying to wave at me. \n\nThey frantically waved and pointed, I tried waving back and gesturing to them, but they kept pointing at me.... why were they pointing?\n\nThen I heard it, the garden shears scraping against the ground as Prudence picked them up and charged towards me. “You ignorant little bitch! You aren’t even listening. You’re don’t deserve my home! You killed her!”\n\nThe twins had been telling me to turn around, I shouldn’t have taken my eyes off her. \n\nLuckily, unlike my earlier shock when I had first seen her, I didn’t freeze. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran faster than I ever have before. I burst back into the building and heard neighbours on the bottom floor lock their doors in a symphony of bolts clicking. \n\nI couldn’t blame them. Prudence wasn’t far behind me and I wouldn’t want to take her on in her current state if given a choice. But it didn’t stop me pounding on their doors begging someone to call the police, although something told me that in this building that wasn’t going to happen. I ran up the stairs, still being followed by her. \n\nBy the second floor most were still locked but a few had come out of their homes, armed with a variety of heavy objects. Even in a crisis, I couldn’t fault the community spirit here. I ran another flight of stairs that became two but still lead me to floor 3 and then to the back of the corridor. I pounded on Terri’s door.\n\nMy heart was racing but when I turned Prue was nowhere to be seen. I was hoping the people who came out on floor 2 had stopped her but something was odd. I hadn’t heard any commotion. This wasn’t the end of it.\n\nEddie and Ellie hugged me tight as Terri let me in and bolted the door shut quickly behind me. I told her about what had happened. She couldn’t believe what Prue had done. It turned out no one knew about Lyla. \n\nI was edgy for the first hour. But Prue had disappeared. Terri helped to clean up my burn and put some cold compress on it. She offered to take me to the hospital, but I couldn’t. \n\nI was too shaken up from what had just happened, I couldn’t face trying to explain how I’d sustained my injuries and I still hadn’t reported Jamie missing. He still hadn’t had any messages from his family, and work had given up calling, but his friends had started. They were harassing me non stop but I had been too distracted to come up with a decent lie.\n\nIt had been a week since I moved in and it wouldn’t be long until people realised something was seriously wrong. My conversations with my family had been short, with me insisting they didn’t visit until we were “unpacked and set up”. \n\nOn top of a murderous old lady and an untold amount of abnormal issues the real world problems were starting to creep up on me. \n\nI sat with Terri for hours, drinking tea and chatting to her. It started to get dark and Eddie and Ellie came into the living room after playing in their room for a while. The voids replaced the big, brown puppy dog eyes again and their claws looked especially sharp, but to me they were still adorable. \n\nTheir transformation prompted me to head back to my flat, it was late. I needed to work out what to do next and how to dig myself out of this giant hole. I couldn’t just keep planting gardens. I needed to do this myself. \n\nI wandered up the stairs, they went on for a while, but nothing too horrific. I passed the man on floor 5, nodding politely and continuing my ascent. I wondered if he’d received the letter of concern yet, he was a little unsettling. \n\nWhen I got to my floor Mr Prentice was making his animal noises again. I smiled, which hurt my face. After all the madness I was starting to find the seemingly benign horrors of this building oddly comforting. \n\nI reached my flat and turned the key in the door before bolting myself in like Terri had. \n\nI could feel something wasn’t right the moment I entered. The flat was in chaos, which was nothing new because we had only moved in a week ago and I had been too preoccupied to unpack. But things were out of place, the organised chaos wasn’t how I’d left it. \n\nThen she strolled out of my kitchen. Prudence Hemmings. She was carrying a large carving knife in her left hand this time, she had prepared for her attack. She smiled at me and lifted her right hand, jingling a set of keys that she had entered with. \n\nI turned to unbolt the door but she grabbed me from behind before I could turn the handle to open it and held the knife to my throat. \n\n“I will kill you for what you’ve done.” She whispered into my ear. \n\nWithout a second thought I leaned forward just a tad and swung my head back as hard as I could. I couldn’t believe that it worked but I must have broken her nose. Prudence dropped the knife and clutched her face, blood streaming between her fingers. \n\nI went to grab the knife but she was closer and doing the same thing. I had no other option but to run again. I grabbed the door handle and turned it to exit the flat as she tried to stab me. I was mostly out the door, but her arm was close enough to reach my side, and I felt the knife pierce the side of my torso.\n\nI was in searing pain but I didn’t stop running. As I stepped outside my flat I could still hear Mr Prentice’s noises flooding the entire hallway. It gave me an idea. \n\nI ran towards his door, Prudence stabbing at me frantically with blood gushing from her nose. A few got me as I stopped outside flat 48, the pain was awful and I could feel myself starting to drift out of consciousness, I was losing a lot of blood. \n\nI would give my last breath to end Prue. So running on nothing but adrenaline I knocked hard on flat 48, and shouted.\n\n“Mr Prentice, can you help me?”\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, I didn’t know what would happen but I had to try something.\n\nShe had stopped stabbing at me, she was enjoying watching me bleed out slowly from the wounds she had already inflicted.\n\nI was incredibly weak, and I lost consciousness not long after that, but before I did I heard heavy clunking from the inside of flat 48, chain locks being released and bolts being undone. I watched with blurry vision as a large creature, that I can only describe as a cross between a bull and a wolf, charged out of the flat and trampled the old witch to death. I heard hear bones crunch just as slipped away. \n\nI woke up in the hospital a day later. My parents were there as were the police, apparently I had been found just outside the tower block with my handbag missing, by a neighbour who had been watching from a window as it happened. \n\nThe police told me that the person had seen the mugging out of their window. They had seen two men approach me and Jamie, splash something in my face, attack us, and when he tried to fight back, they bundled my boyfriend into a car, which the police had been searching for to no avail. He was officially missing. \n\nI was baffled, but grateful that Jamie’s disappearance wouldn’t be blamed on me. I went along with it and made out that he had ghosted work to enjoy our first week living together. \n\nI had been stabbed 4 times but thankfully in all the right places, if there is such a thing as the right place to be stabbed. I lost a lot of blood but I was going to be fine. They were all shallow. They assumed my burns were chemical and happened during the mugging too. \n\nThe police promised to keep us updated but they still can’t find the car. They never will. I wish the story the police had been told were true, it left some hope for Jamie. \n\nMy parents weren’t keen on me returning to the flat after what happened, they said the area was too rough, and that I was living proof it wasn’t safe. They offered to collect my stuff for me. I insisted though, told them that I wanted to see how I felt and they couldn’t force me not to.\n\nI was released from the hospital two days after I woke up in there. When I arrived at the flats, it was strange. It felt like home. Despite everything, something about this place drew me to it. \n\nI took the lift for the first time since Jamie had died. I had to, I wasn’t recovered enough to conquer too many stairs just yet, and I couldn’t guarantee they’d be kind to me. I smiled at the lack of a button 9 and winced at the thought of the creatures. \n\nAs I reached my corridor I saw Mr Prentice walking along with his newspaper and milk in a bag. He turned to me and smiled.\n\n“I wasn’t sure you’d come back. It’s nice to see you’re up and walking.” He made small talk as if I hadn’t seen him literally trample a woman to death a couple of days prior. The whole experience had been so disorienting that I started to wonder if I really had been mugged and had dreamed the note and everything that’s happened since. Then he said something that confirmed everything was real. \n\n“I never liked that woman. But you’ve got a real friend in the lady downstairs.” He winked at me and turned the key in his door. \n\nI got into mine and sat down on the second hand sofa. I felt empty but relieved. With Prue and the imposter Qneighbours all gone the only threat left were the creatures in the lift, who were only a threat between 1.11 and 3.33.\n\nMaybe I could start to live a semi peaceful life in this place. \n\nTerri knocked on the door, my handbag, that I had left at hers before Prue attacked in my flat, on her arm. Mr Prentice was right, she was a good friend. \n\nI thanked her for what she’d done and for what she’d told the police. She said it was pure luck that she found me, she had been walking up to return the bag and found me and Prue sprawled out on the floor. I asked what happened to Prue’s body and she just pointed in the direction of flat 48. \n\n“He was eating it.” She said.\n\nIt’s been a few days now and I’ve decided to stay. I can’t imagine going back to complete normality after everything I’ve been through and I’ve grown quite attached to some of the buildings quirks. \n\nI tried replanting the garden with the help of the twins. I ripped a few stitches doing it and Derek never came. I think he’s gone for good.\n\nI’m ready to fully embrace life here. The last few days have been hard but there’s some time to breathe. Along with the time to breathe, came the time to grieve and I’ve been grieving badly for Jamie.  \n\nThis leads me to the last thing I have to tell you. \n\nLast night I laid in bed, plagued with thoughts of Prue and everything that had happened, but what I couldn’t get to leave my mind was how much happiness it bought her to have Lyla back. It infected every part of my thoughts. I know you all warned me not to, but I did it. I repeated the ritual. \n\nI haven’t caught him yet, but I’ve heard the scratching. [Jamie’s back.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/h86ihe\/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_the\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"},"267":{"title":"The Climb","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8rz8wj\/the_climb\/","flair":null,"author":"boredandpoor","selftext":"“I want you to kill her,” the voice echoed. Low, monotonic, unwavering. \n\nIn front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. \n\nHer eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. \n\nHer mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas.\n\n“This is hardly an existence,” the voice licked.\n\nI surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above.\n\nAbout five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. \n\n“What are you waiting for? As if you care,” the voice prompted.\n\nWho was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket.\n\nIn one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t like being lost. \n\nI felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. \n\nI needed to get out of here. \n\n“End her.”\n\nMy gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. \n\nA knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. \n\nAn arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy.\n\nI reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother’s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. \n\nMy mother always knew what was going on. \n\nWith the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. \n\nAnd through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. \n\nI held up my left hand to coddle my mother’s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. \n\nAnd as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I’d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. \n\nBecause it didn’t matter how bad anything got. It didn’t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. \n\nMy mother was just happy I was there. \n\nI steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. \n\nThe first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. \n\nI exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother’s eyes. \n\n“M-Mum?”\n\nBut as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. \n\n“Climb.”\n\nI peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. \n\nAnd as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. \n\n“I love you.”\n\n“I love you too, mum.”\n\nI never said that enough.\n\nThen, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. \n\nI climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. \n\nI cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. \n\nI reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. \n\nI climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. \n\nAnd as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. \n\nI could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. \n\nAs I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. \n\nThe light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. \n\nUrgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze.\n\n“Are you alright in there? Your sister called. We’re worried about you.”\n\nIt was my mother’s voice.\n\nI got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. \n\nShe held me in her arms and we sobbed. \n\n“I wouldn’t know how to live without you,” she whimpered.\n\nMy climb had just begun."},"268":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. \n\nI didn’t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. \n\nEddie and Ellie clutched Terri’s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn’t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. \n\n“Hi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?” She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. “How’s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.”\n\n“Don’t speak about her! She’s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!” I screamed at her, I couldn’t bare looking at her face again. “You don’t scare me with all your freak friends. I’m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!”\n\nNatalia chuckled. I gulped. \n\nI may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend’s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I’m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. \n\nBut when I said she didn’t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. \n\n“I know you aren’t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That’s why we’re here.\n\n“My brothers and sisters are not freaks. You’re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.\n\n“That’s why we set the fire, all those years ago.”  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. \n\n“Those people weren’t disposable...” Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.\n\n“What was that Terri? Did you have something to say.” Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.\n\n“I was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.” Terri said with slightly more confidence. \n\nNone of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. \n\n“Why would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?” I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn’t let it happen. \n\n“We were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live” She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. \n\n“Michaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn’t live the righteous way that we did. He didn’t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. \n\n“Our group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.” \n\nTerri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. \n\n“You were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!” Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn’t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. \n\nAs Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. \n\n“Don’t insult us. I’m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.” Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.\n\nFor the first time since the people had entered Terri’s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.\n\nTerri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.\n\n“Michael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you’re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn’t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.” She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. \n\nIt may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn’t explain their powers. \n\n“Things went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. \n\nThe group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We’d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn’t need any more attention. \n\n“Michael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. \n\n“Michael couldn’t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. \n\n“As you know, we obliged.” This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. \n\n“We took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we’d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!\n\n“But then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. \n\n“I couldn’t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn’t matter how many times we tried. \n\n“We couldn’t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn’t let us. It didn’t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. \n\n“We may have been dead but we didn’t disappear. We couldn’t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn’t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. \n\n“Two months passed and he hadn’t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. \n\n“*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*”\n\nI gasped. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn’t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.\n\n“The old bat didn’t tell you that then?” She asked, although it wasn’t really a question. “That her stupid husband is the whole reason we’re here!” \n\n“We started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn’t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. \n\n“We only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn’t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue’s gone. It’s fair game in here now.”\n\nAs Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. \n\nI didn’t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.\n\nIt was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. \n\nShe opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. \n\nEddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. \n\nShit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. \n\n“This isn’t over!” She screamed, and I knew that it wasn’t. \n\nI stayed on Terri’s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.\n\nI didn’t sleep much. Nothing new. \n\nWhen I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn’t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn’t skip on my way up. \n\nI hadn’t checked the time when I left Terri’s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. \n\n“Hey, love!” He shouted as he noticed me. \n\n“I need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?” I practically begged him at the doorstep.\n\nI told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn’t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn’t let them in then I’d be fine. \n\nHe looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn’t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn’t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.\n\nI wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.\n\nBut if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? \n\nWhen he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. \n\nPrudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn’t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She’s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. \n\nI wasn’t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn’t going to win. \n\nI decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn’t need Prue’s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. \n\nThis was war.\n\nThe next steps : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ckw07c\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"269":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

If Melanie was somehow a fake, that meant they must have sent her.  And if they sent her, that meant they knew.  They knew about the messages in her painting.  They knew about me asking questions.  And they knew I didn’t hit a button during any of it.\n\nI felt panic and fear crawling up my chest, making it hard to breathe.  Standing up, I started pacing, periodically glancing back at the monitor to see if Rachel could help me, tell me what I needed to do next.  But she had laid down on her bed.  It was hard to tell for sure with her back to the camera, but I think she was crying.\n\nNo, I needed to fix this.  Get her out of there.  And if I didn’t have a better plan, I’d just have to go with the one I already had.  \n\nFeeling the hard eye of the ceiling camera on me, I went to the door and stepped back into the locker room.  My phone was in my locker, and after messing up the combination the first time, I got the door open and got it out.  Gripping it tightly, I tried to hold it by my side casually, but I knew there was little point.  If they knew everything, I wasn’t going to be able to hide anything.  I just had to try and be fast, get some kind of message out to people that could help Rachel before they got to me.\n\nI opened the camera on the phone as I re-entered the surveillance room and hit record.  It made a small beeping noise and once I was sure it was recording, I turned the camera on myself.\n\n“My name…my name is Tommy.  Thomas Calhoun.  And my job is watching a woman trapped in a room.  This is not a joke or a movie or…whatever.  This is real.  For three years my job is to sit in this room…”  I moved the camera slowly around the room, taking in the door to the bathroom, the water cooler, the desk with the monitors, keyboard, and button box, “…and watch a video feed of a woman locked up in a bedroom somewhere.”  I stepped closer to the desk and made sure the monitor showing Rachel was clear and in focus.  “I didn’t know this woman was a prisoner at first…or I tricked myself into thinking she wasn’t because the money was good.  Either way, I know she is now.  She is in danger and so am I.”\n\nAfter lingering on video of her for a few more seconds to make sure every detail could be seen, I turned the camera back on myself.  I had to hurry, or the video might be too big to send quickly.  I was trying to stay calm, but I felt myself tearing up as I went on, and I did my best to keep my words clear.  “Please help her.  I don’t know where she is.  I don’t know who has her, because I don’t know who I really work for.  But they are bad people and she is not safe.”\n\n“All I know is that I work at a building at [redacted] right outside of San Antonio.  (Per Nosleep rules, to be clear this address is not real.) I only know the names of two other people connected to this place.  The man who hired me, Mr. Solomon.  And a man who might have a job like mine…Charlie Jeffers…no, Jefferies I think.  I don’t know if they are real people…I mean, I don’t know if that is their real names.  Please.  I’m not crazy.  I know how this sounds.  Just come here, see the room.  Figure out where she is and help her.  And…”\n\nI heard the muffled sound of the outer door opening into the locker room and I frantically fumbled with the phone to stop the recording.  How do I send?  Oh no, how do I…there it is.  I hit the button to share, and felt a new panic rising.  Who should I send it to?  I had only a handful of contacts, and I just selected them all.  Maybe at least one of them would take it seriously and get help.  As I heard the door to the surveillance room opening behind me, I hit send.\n\n**Not connected to data service or WiFi.  Please send again when connected.**\n\n*What?  No no no no…*\n\nI turned to see Mr. Solomon entering the room.  He was flanked by two large men in dark suits that looked like bodyguards or something.  Raising a finger, he wagged it at me.  \n\n“No service in here, Thomas.  But then you should never need service in here, so long as you followed the rules.”\n\n****\n\nThey took me easily.  I tried to make it to the bathroom and close the door, but the two guards stopped me and pulled me down.  They put the…what do you call them?  Zipties on my hands and feet and pulled a black bag over my head.  Then I was being carried out of the room and it felt like they must have put me in the back of a van that was pulled right up to the building.  I was laying on what felt like thin, weird smelling carpet that covered a hard metal layer underneath.\n\nI heard someone get into the van with me, and I asked where we were going.  If they would just take me and let Rachel go.  There was a short laugh overhead and then Mr. Solomon’s voice as he told me that he would explain everything when we got where we were going.  For now, he said, I needed to relax.  It was a long drive and I would need the rest.  \n\nI went to say more, but then I felt a sharp pain in my neck.  They had stabbed me, or…no, they injected me with something.  I was feeling so strange now, but I had to stay awake.  I had to try and get away, I had to…\n\n****\n\n“Hello again, Thomas.”\n\nI blinked as I began looking around.  My mouth was dry and my head hurt, but otherwise I felt okay.  I wasn’t tied up any more--Instead I was laying back on a padded table like I’d seen when I went to the doctor.\n\nBut this wasn’t a doctor’s office.  The room was large, and aside from the padded table, it held a small bed, a desk with a computer monitor on it, and a couple of chairs.  Sitting in one of those chairs was Mr. Solomon.\n\nI raised up slowly, blinking at him.  “Where is she?  Is Rachel okay?”\n\nThe man smiled.  “You really are something, Thomas.  Trying to be the hero, even if you don’t quite know how.  I respect that.”  Licking his lips, he leaned forward slightly.  “In fact, I respect that so much that I’ve decided to start our new relationship with as much honesty as I’m allowed.  Some of my colleagues disagree with this approach, but you know what?  Fuck them.  This is my project, and I think you deserve to know what’s going on.”  Looking more serious, he stood up, lifting the gun he had been holding casually in his lap.  “But before we get into the details, would you like to see Rachel?”\n\nI slid off the table and nodded as I caught myself from falling.  My legs were still wobbly from whatever they had given me, but I barely noticed.  “Yes, please.  Let me see her.  The real her.”\n\nMr. Solomon gave a small laugh and gestured toward a nearby door.  “Yes, reality is always best.  She’s just there in the next room.”  \n\nI stumbled my way forward, my legs getting better as I walked, and when I grabbed the doorknob, it turned easily.  I expected the door to lead to her bedroom, but instead it opened into another room a lot like the one I had been in, though the stuff in it was different.  Strange machines filled the walls, and in the back of the room was a large…aquarium?  I didn’t know.  It was a big cylinder taller than I was, and it was filled with some kind of gray liquid.   There was a shape in that liquid,\n\n“Go ahead, Thomas.  Feel free to go have a good look.  You’ve earned it.”  I felt my stomach clenching tighter at Mr. Solomon’s words and the meanness in them.  My legs felt heavy again now, but it wasn’t from the drugs this time.\n\nShuffling forward, I could see the shape was a person.  *Oh no*  Or at least a body, because it was clear from just looking at it that the person was dead.  It was very well-preserved, but I could see how the skin hung wrong and looked bloated in spots.  *Oh God, no no no*  Its hair, which had been floating like seaweed in front of its face, drifted away as I reached the glass, and I could see Rachel staring out at me.\n\n“Murderer!”  I turned on Solomon and started to run toward him when he shot me.  Suddenly I was on the ground convulsing as he stepped closer.\n\n“Don’t worry, Thomas.  It won’t kill you.  Just make you unable to move much for a bit.”  I heard more footfalls as my body began to still.  “Get him up, take him back to the other room.”\n\nI could barely feel anything as I was carried back to the padded table and propped up into a sitting position.  This time I was strapped down, but I guessed it was more so I didn’t fall off, because I couldn’t move anything other than my head, and even that just a little.  I could hardly see at all for crying, but I recognized the blurry shape of Solomon sitting back down in front of me.\n\n“Before you ask…well, when you are able to ask anything again, yes, that is Rachel.  Not a fake Rachel, not a dummy, and not some kind of trick.  As I said, the time for tricks is past.  Now is the time for truth.”\n\nFrowning slightly, he went on.  “Thomas, I understand that showing you that, showing you her body that way, might seem very cruel.  You may hate me for it right now.  I would understand it if you did.  But you called me a murderer, and at least in this specific context, I think that is unfair, because I didn’t kill Rachel.  In truth, I’ve been with this aspect of the project for only seven years.”\n\nHe gestured back to the door behind him.  “And Rachel has been dead for over eight.”\n\nI felt my eyes widen as though they belonged to someone else’s body.  It was more lies.  More tricks.  All of it.  Oh God, it had to be.\n\n“Do you know what remote viewing is?”  He rolled his eyes.  “Sorry, right, you can’t talk right now.  I’ll just assume you don’t.  Remote viewing is a broad term for the ability to see things that are far away from you physically, to know things you shouldn’t be able to know through your normal five senses.  Some describe it as a psychic ability, though there are several schools of thought as to how and why it works.”\n\nHis eyes fixed on mine intently.  “Because it does work, Thomas.  Various governments and private organizations have studied it for a very long time, and while publicly it is always ridiculed as pseudoscience and foolish superstition, the reality is that some people have the innate ability…that means it comes naturally…to somehow see other places.”\n\n“Rachel was one of those people.  She came into the program when she was seventeen, having been identified via a front-facing screening process that was ran as a psychological test that paid subjects well at a time when Rachel was looking to make some money.  Three months after being identified as a good candidate, she was taken, and after the initial adjustment period, she became a largely compliant asset that quickly rose to the top of our talent pool.”\n\nSolomon folded his hands on his knee.  “I know you cared for her, Thomas, so I think this is worth sharing.  Rachel was never treated badly, other than her confinement and the occasional test that was mildly unpleasant.  No, we all treasured her.  She was enormously talented, not just as a remote viewer, but as an artist.  That’s how she would convey what she saw, you understand.  She would enter into an almost trancelike state when she painted, and when she was done, she would have given us a painting of images and words that provided…well, it was very valuable information.”  He chuckled.  “If you ever wondered, that’s why there was always such care that the paintings were never shown to the camera.”\n\nPicking at his pants, he went on.  “Rachel was so talented, that she was selected for a new program that we thought might greatly enhance or alter her ability.  We introduced something…foreign…into her body.  At first, nothing seemed to change.  If anything, the accuracy of her remote viewing was declining, which was a problem for us and for her.”\n\n“But then we realized that we were reading the new paintings wrong.  She was able to see more clearly than ever--she just was no longer bound to only current events.  Now her sight transcended time.”  He paused, and I realized he was enjoying telling the story.  The bastard was having a good time, pausing to make it more dramatic.  I would fucking kill him.  “While this made some of her paintings less immediately useful, they became much more valuable as we were able to decipher them.  For a time, it looked as though everything was working better than we had ever hoped.”\n\nHis lips thinned.  “And then, one day, she showed a painting to the camera.”\n\n“It said, ‘Please help me Thomas’.  This immediately sent up all kinds of red flags.  She knew not to show paintings to the camera, and now she was trying to communicate with someone?  We didn’t disrupt her routine, but an intensive investigation began into who she was talking to.  Was it one of her handlers?  One of the technicians?  Someone from her past life?  But nothing checked out.”\n\nLeaning back in his chair, a look of pride grew on Solomon’s face as he continued.  “I was the one that first suggested the idea that she was, intentionally or not, knowingly or not, seeing and talking to someone in the future.  I was still an outside consultant at the time, but by that point we had more strange behaviors from her, including the second message painting, ‘That girl isn’t me’.  My theory made some sense, but it very quickly ran into a greater obstacle.”\n\n“The introduction of the foreign material had not been as seamless as we had hoped, despite her having been stable for almost three years since it was implanted.  Whether it was due to her increasing emotional upset and stress, or simply the passage of time, she suddenly began to deteriorate.  Her work became more erratic and hard to understand as her body began to decline.  We were monitoring her health closely, but it didn’t matter.  Five days after she painted ‘That girl isn’t me’, she suddenly went into cardiac arrest and died.  Somewhat inexplicably, we were unable to resuscitate her.”\n\nThe man sighed.  “This was a great loss.  And it required adjustments of my theory.  Based on everything we knew, it still made sense that she was talking to someone.  Someone with access to the camera feed, and very likely someone named Thomas.  If Thomas was viewing that camera footage in the future, as I believed, then he must be working for us in the future.”  He gave me a thin smile.  “And whether you believe that the future is set in stone or not, I’m all for giving it a helping hand.”\n\n“Seven years ago I began the Thomas Project.  Over the course of that time I have overseen the screening and hiring of forty-three men named Thomas at several different sites, all with one very specific job.  To watch the videos of Rachel from just before her implant to the time of her death.”\n\nI tried to speak, but my mouth still wouldn’t work.  I wanted to say he was lying, that it didn’t make sense, that it *was* another trick…but I think I wanted to hear it more for myself.  Because I didn’t think he was lying.  I didn’t think it was a trick.  And I thought I was starting to understand.\n\n“The point wasn’t really them watching the videos, of course.  It was how they *reacted* to watching the videos.  What they did, and how that matched up with what Rachel had done in response in the past.”\n\n“Thirteen percent quit after the first day.  Thirty-eight percent hit either the red or the green button after the first message asking for help and saying their name.  Twenty-two percent attempted to contact the authorities before reaching the stage where ‘Melanie’ was introduced.”  He shook his head slightly.  “I wish I could take credit for her introduction, but it wasn’t my suggestion.  We assumed from the ‘that girl isn’t me’ message that there was a double of Rachel introduced to you at some point, perhaps to kill you or dissuade you or find out what you knew.  But it took a few tries until we felt it was well-refined, and as I’ve pointed out, only twenty-seven percent made it that far.  And all of them failed the next test.”  He pointed at me.\n\n“Her name.”\n\n“You see, the girl you’ve been watching, that talented, wonderful girl whose body is preserved in the next room?  Her name was Rachel Donovan.  I had always wondered if Rachel was merely seeing you, or if there was some kind of connection between the two of you.  When you called ‘Melanie’ Rachel, I knew that we had finally found the right Thomas--the distant point of light that our Rachel was looking at across space and time.”\n\nI swallowed thickly and found I could feel my tongue, if only a little.  Slurring badly, I pushed out a single word.\n\n“W-why?”\n\nSolomon looked surprised.  “I’d have thought that’d be clear by now.  You’re our only remaining link to one of our greatest treasures.  Perhaps you have a similar ability, or it may be that she forged the link purely though her own talent and will.  But either way, you are important and you have more work to do.”  He stood up and moved over to the table where he turned on the monitor.  As it came to life, I saw it was a frozen image of Rachel’s room--a tape paused where I had left off watching.  Turning back to me, the man looked solemn.\n\n[“You have to watch the rest of it.  Because Rachel painted you more pictures before she died, and we have to know what they mean.”](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n**** \n\n[Final Part](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue2kk)"},"270":{"title":"They told me I was nothing but a dog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/a1xyn9\/they_told_me_i_was_nothing_but_a_dog\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My father named me Laika because when I was born, my grandfather told him to treat me like a bad dog. To Father, *Laika* was synonymous with *dog*. He used the name to remind me of my place in the hierarchy: lesser. Beneath. Inferior.\n\nNothing but a dog. \n\nMy father meant to humiliate and degrade me with such a name, but he honored me instead.\n\nYou see, Laika was a stray dog from Moscow. On 3 November 1957, the Soviet Union put her on Sputnik 2 and launched her into space. She was the very first animal to orbit Earth.\n\nThe Soviets knew how to put a rocket into space, but they didn’t know how to bring it back. This made Laika’s mission a death sentence. Shortly after reaching orbit, the interior of Sputnik 2 became catastrophically hot – far too hot for mammals to tolerate. Mere hours after launch, Laika died an agonizing death. She perished the same way she’d lived: lesser, beneath, inferior. Abandoned. Unloved.\n\nNothing but a dog.\n\nI spent many hours imagining her terror, pain, and loneliness. How would it feel, spending my last hours hurtling through divine darkness in a metal bucket?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand what I was seeing, or why it was suddenly so loud and so hot?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand why – after being plucked from cruel streets and dropped into a bustling world of kindness – I was now alone? Perhaps I would think I’d been a bad dog. Perhaps I’d think this was my punishment.\n\nPunishment is my mother tongue. I know what it was like to be punished for transgressions I cannot remember or understand, to be hurt so badly my heart rate triples and my mind flies out the window and soars into the stars, retracing Laika’s doomed flight while my husk squirms and weeps on the floor of a dirty house sixty-eight miles below. \n\nEven so, I adapted to punishment. As I said, it eventually becomes a language. Given enough time, anyone can learn a language.\n\nWhat I could not adapt to was fear. \n\nAs a child, I was afraid of everything. You see, in the deepest, most forgotten parts of the world, there are things that most people cannot believe and even fewer would understand. Old ways, old things, old truths. \n\nAnd old monsters.\n\nMonsters like my father and my grandfather. \n\nHow can I describe this in a way you will believe? Maybe I can’t. Maybe I shouldn’t try. So instead, I will describe my grandfather.\n\nHe was called Paval. By the time I turned nine, he had gone through six bodies. By this, I mean he inhabited them. Using a variant of blood magic perfected by my forebears across many centuries, he leapt from body to body.\n\nHe was not a spirit; he had a corporeal body of his own, a twisted, monstrous thing covered in scars and hard, glittering skin, a body that could shrink to the size of a garden snake or expand to the size of a house.\n\nBut for all its marvels, this body was weak; sunlight burnt its eyes and blistered its flesh. So it entered other bodies, like a hand inside a puppet, and wore them until they rotted away. I will never forget the sight of him – of many hims – in different bodies as flesh degraded and fell away in wet, discolored strings. Or the way his eyes – hard, round yellow eyes – glinted deep within their stolen sockets.\n\nGrandfather preferred the bodies of men, but sometimes chose women or children. Once, he even wore the body of my mother. I was very young then – perhaps three – and the sight of her familiar form standing before the fire sent me into such transports of joy that I bawled from sheer ecstasy.\n\nThen she turned around, and in her bruised sockets I saw my grandfather’s eyes: flat, glittering yellow. Like rotted gold.\n\nI reared back, screaming.\n\nMy father, who had been stroking a pair of old baby shoes, looked at me with contempt so deep it scorched my heart. “Shut up, dog!”\n\nI cringed. This was a mistake; his contempt exploded into disgust. He shot out of his chair and stomped upon me. Dirty, squirmy pain exploded across my abdomen. I hobbled away, whimpering, and hid under the stairs.\n\nI lay there alone for many hours. Eventually my mind left my body and soared into the sky, a reverse dive into a sea of stars. I drifted away, dreaming of diamond-colored constellations and red nebulae. At my side was a curly-tailed dog with a striped face. My namesake. \n\nLaika.\n\nWhen I woke, I *felt* her: furry and warm, chest rising and falling under my hand. I opened my eyes. For just an instant I saw her in the shadows. Then she shrank away, sinking into the ground. I tried to grab her, but the floor swallowed her. My fingers closed on cold, hard floorboards. \n\nI covered my eyes and wept.\n\nSeveral months later, Grandfather-Within-Mother gave birth to a child. A baby boy with yellow eyes and my father’s curly black hair. Mere minutes after the birth, Father picked up the baby and took him outside. He returned an hour later, empty-handed.\n\nSpurred by horror, I immediately ran out into the night. The cold was brutal, at once invigorating and exhausting. I searched until I found the baby, whimpering weakly beside a snowdrift. He was still covered in birth blood.\n\nI named him Alexander and brought him home.\n\nWhen I walked in, Father immediately slapped me. I reeled back as stars rocketed across my vision. “Never,” he hissed, contempt dripping from every syllable, “never disobey again. Give him to me now.” He reached for Alexander, but Grandfather stopped him.\n\nI looked up, and swallowed a whimper. Grandfather stared back at me through my mother’s rotting face. The mouth – puffy and discolored, with an oddly detached look – quirked into a smile. “No. Let the dog keep her pup. We have other concerns.” \n\nThey certainly did; they worked together, and they worked constantly. Father kidnapped victims, and Grandfather used them. Whenever Father brought a new victim to the cabin, Grandfather used his hands – long, hideous things marked with scars and covered in strange, glittering flesh – to tear out the victim’s tongue and crush their feet. \n\nThen he would wait until nightfall – because remember, sunlight burned Grandfather’s eyes and blistered his skin - and carry them to his Chapel.\n\nHis Chapel was an ancient stone structure at the base of a wooded hill. Within the chapel were three red windows and six rough-hewn pews. At the end of each pew sat desiccated corpses, facing the altar like sentries.\n\nI hated Grandfather’s chapel; the very air weighed upon me whenever I entered, crushing my heart and poisoning my lungs. The worst part was the fear: electric and paralyzing, inescapable.\n\nLuckily, I was just a dog, and dogs do not spend much time inside chapels. But dogs hear screams. Even screams from far away, echoing down forested mountains long into the night. \n\nGrandfather did not often leave his Chapel, but when he did it was always in the wee hours of the morning. I know this because my father and I were required to hold vigil until he walked through our door. Whenever Grandfather came back from his Chapel, he looked human again: smooth skin, wide smile, good proportions. Sometimes he looked a bit like Father. Sometimes he looked like his victim.\n\nIt was as incomprehensible to me as outer space would have been to Laika. \n\nThe stream of Grandfather’s victims never ended. Vagrants, the elderly, the travelers, orphans fleeing violence. There were so many.\n\nSo, so many.\n\nIf it weren’t for Alexander, I would have withered into nothing. He was more than a brother to me; for all intents and purposes, he was my son. Neither Father nor Grandfather cared for him. They didn’t even feed or clothe him; I had to feed and dress him with what little I had. \n\nDespite my best efforts, he never learned to speak. That isn’t to say he couldn’t communicate – he could, with gestures and facial expressions and nonsense syllables – but language eluded him. But it was all right. He grew into a sweet, curious boy with freckles and long, delicate hands. Over time, his terrible yellow eyes mellowed into a clear, bright green. He was my life. He was my heart.\n\nBut he wasn’t enough.\n\nOne night, as a little girl’s screams came shrieking down the mountain from Grandfather’s Chapel, I finally went to my father.\n\nI lay prostrate at his feet, which is how he taught me to approach him. The wooden floor was rough and painfully cold under my fingers. “Why, Father? Why do you do this?”\n\nHe sat in his chair, watching the fire. In his hands he held a pair of white baby shoes. “Because your Grandfather and I must live, little dog.”\n\n“Will I have to do this to live?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then I don’t want to live.”\n\n“I understand,” he said. His grip tightened on the shoes. “But you don’t have a choice.”\n\nI choked back a sob and waited for the dismissal; I could not come to him without crawling, and I could not leave until he told me so.\n\nInstead, he said, “Stand up, Laika.”\n\nHearing my name was like being doused in ice water. He never used it; by that point, in fact, I’d almost forgotten I had a name.\n\n“I said, stand up, Laika.”\n\nIt was a struggle to obey; fear made my bones rubbery and my muscles weak. \n\nFather held out the baby shoes. “What do you see?”\n\n“Shoes.” My voice quavered. “Old baby shoes.”\n\n“Those shoes,” Father said, “belonged my sister, Alexandra. I loved her more than anything. More than life. More than my parents. More than your mother. More than you. She was my heart.”\n\nI watched him. The firelight threw his face into relief, creating crevasses out of wrinkles. His curly black hair shifted like smoke, and his long, sharp nose looked strange and monstrous. Paralytic electricity swarmed my skin, so much like the Chapel that I could have wept.\n\n“On my twelfth birthday,” Father said, “your grandfather boiled a pot of oil and called Alexandra to him. She and I were going to pick wildflowers later, so she was dressed in her finest clothes: a blue dress and white shoes. These shoes.” \n\nFather did not speak for a very long while.\n\n“She was my heart,” he finally repeated. “When my heart broke, I broke. It made me like Grandfather. Someday, I will be just like him. I will live forever. You will, too.” \n\nThat night, I had a nightmare of a little girl with sunken yellow eyes melting into blisters as my mother’s rotted body doused her with boiling oil. \n\nI woke screaming.\n\nMoonlight streamed through the window, drenching my room in celestial silver. My heart thumped so wildly that I could see my nightshirt moving. It wanted to escape. I wanted it to escape, to, because without it I would die, and when I was dead I could sail the stars with the other Laika.\n\nSmall, warm hands touched my face. I turned, expecting Alexander. Instead I saw my nightmare. \n\nGreat inflamed blisters bubbled and burst, sending rivulets of pus down her tiny, raw face. The skin around its mouth had burned away, leaving neat rows of milk teeth fully exposed. Burned scalp and dull bone glinted through black, curly hair. A blue dress clung to her body. Oil dripped from the hem, soaking my blanket.\n\n“Don’t cry,” she whispered.\n\nAlexander stirred between us.\n\n“Get out,” I whispered.\n\nThe girl’s blistered chin quivered. “But you made me come here. Please let me sleep.”\n\n“All right,” I whispered, because I did not know what else to say.\n\nThe girl burrowed under my blanket. I watched, aghast, as she threw a bony, burnt arm across Alexander and drifted to sleep.  \n\nThat night, I did not sail the stars with Laika. Instead I sat awake, watching the apparition with mingled excitement and fear.\n\nJust before dawn, my door creaked open. I tried to shield the girl as my father stepped into the room. \n\n“What is that?” he asked sharply.\n\n“Please,” I whined. “Please, don’t.”\n\nThe girl shifted, and – incredibly – began to shrink. Her body flattened into nothing, leaving her dress crumpled on the floor. That sank away, too, leaving the cold, empty floor in its wake.\n\n“*What was that?*” Father screamed.\n\n“I saw it in my sleep –”\n\n“*Her!*” Father roared. “*Her*, not *it*!”\n\n“I s-saw her in my sleep,” I stammered helplessly. “When I woke, she was here.”\n\nSweat gleamed on Father’s skin, reminding me of stars. “Get dressed. You must see your grandfather immediately.”\n\nI fell to my hands and knees and crawled to him. \n\n“No,” he said. “Stand up. Bring the boy.”\n\nAlexander wept angrily when I picked him up. I ignored him and followed Father into the dark forest. The full glory of early spring bathed the landscape: pale beams of light shafted through the canopy, cutting the thick shadows with gold. Vermin crept through the undergrowth, and deer watched from a distance. The forest was always full of animals; Grandfather was no danger to the birds or beasts, after all.\n\nSoon the Chapel came into view: an ancient little church with a black spire, red windows, and frost-encrusted stones. \n\nFather ushered us inside. The moment I crossed the threshold, my skin began to crawl. Dread and fear swept over me. Alexander burst into tears.\n\nFather shoved me toward the altar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sentry corpses twitching. Chests rose and fell in jagged, senseless rhythms. One especially tall corpse with long copper hair turned as I passed.\n\nI covered Alexander’s eyes and stopped at the altar.\n\nShadows thickened and writhed against the back wall. Back in the pews, bones clattered and dried joints creaked.\n\nSomething blinked in the darkness behind the altar: great, flat eyes like golden moons, shining in the cold shadows. \n\nGrandfather.\n\n“The dog,” Grandfather intoned, “and her pup.” He snarled: a deep, bone-shaking rumble like that of a tiger. Teeth glinted in the shadows, a shining ivory arc wider than Father’s entire head.\n\n“Paval,” Father said urgently. “She had a nightmare. When she woke, it followed her out of the dream. It came alive. I saw it.”\n\n“Oh,” Grandfather murmured. “*Oh.*”\n\n“Our little dog has talent after all,” said Father.\n\n“All good and well,” said Grandfather, “*if* she loves her pup. Do you love your pup, dog?” He reared up from the shadows, twisted and sinewy and utterly inhuman. “Do you love him? Or do you feel *obligated* to him?”\n\nI opened my mouth to answer. Instead, I burst into tears.\n\nGrandfather laughed, a low roar that shook dust from the rafters overhead. “A weak bitch indeed. Our hope is in the boy, Mikhail. It was always in the boy. That is why we made him. Now go.” Those great yellow eyes flicked to the pews. “I do not like to tempt my sentries. Not when they are hungry as they are.”\n\nFear and disbelief battled across Father’s weathered face. “Do you not understand what I’ve told you? She creates life from thoughts.”\n\n“A poor substitute for what we require. Leave, Mikhail.”\n\n“But – ”\n\nGrandfather rocketed out of the shadows, a rippling mass of glittering skin and malformed limbs, and knocked Father to the stones.\n\nThe corpse-sentries uttered a deep sigh and continued to twitch.\n\n“Never,” Grandfather snarled. Sunlight poured through the crimson windows, imbuing him strange hide with a red glow. He looked like the sky. A starry piece of outer space. “Never defy me.” \n\nI waited breathlessly for Grandfather’s eyes to burst and his skin to sizzle – he was, after all, exposed to daylight – but it did not.\n\nMany moments later, Grandfather struck Father across the face and whipped back into the darkness.\n\nWe left. Father did not speak again until the cottage came into sight. Then he grabbed me and dragged me off the path.\n\n“Listen,” he growled. “Listen well. I can protect you from him. And…” He looked down at Alexander, eyes blazing with disgust. “When the time comes, I can protect you from *him*, too.  But only if you help me.”\n\n“Why should I need protection? He’s small, and loves me as a mother.”\n\n“Do you remember the story of Alexandra?” Father asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Your story is coming. Only Alexander will be me, and you will be Alexandra.”\n\nMy heart fell to the cold earth. I carefully pressed Alexander’s head into my shoulder, shielding his face from Father. \n\n“Listen, dog. When next you dream of my sister –” His voice broke; he pulled away and ran his fingers through his hair. Tears shone in his eyes, which were huge and miserable over his quivering mouth. “When she comes again, bring her to me.”\n\n“All right, Father.” I had never seen him weep before; the sight was frightening and curiously thrilling. “I will.”\n\nFather nodded curtly, then left. I nearly followed, but thought better of it. Instead, I stayed in the forest with Alexander.\n\nAs the morning brightened and birdsong swelled to a symphony, I set Alexander upon the narrow path. He ran forward, humming a tune of his own composition. Shadow and sunlight dappled his skin, turning him into a woodland sprite. The trees were in full bloom: petals drifted down like snow, carpeting the earth in glistening white.\n\nAlexander pulled ahead. After a while, I couldn’t hear or see him; he’d drifted away, slipping into the deep shadows.\n\nPanic overtook me. “Alexander! *Alexander!*” I rushed ahead, grimacing against the pain in my chest. My heart thumped wildly, so hard I could see my shirt move; it wanted to escape again. “*Alexander!*”\n\nHe darted from between the trees. I halted, overcome with relief so powerful it took my breath away. Petals covered his head and shoulders. As I watched, one drifted down and settled on his nose. Wide green eyes glimmered above it, bright as the promise of spring.\n\nFor the first time in my life, my heart was so full that I wept.\n \nThat night, Alexandra came to me again, blistered flesh dripping down her face. Her eyes had melted away, leaving raw, swollen masses of flesh in her melted sockets.\n\nRemembering my instructions, I sat up. “Father,” I quavered. Alexandra reached for me blindly, ruined hands closing on shadows. “Father!”\n\nFather burst into my room, gasping. “Alexandra!” He shot forward, arms extended as if to sweep her up.\n\nShe turned.\n\nFather froze.\n\nAlexandra tottered toward him. “Mikhail,” she whined. “Mikhail, my eyes hurt.”\n\nFather collapsed and covered his eyes as Alexandra approached. She left a trail of pus and oil, shining like a tiny river in the moonlight.\n\n“Mikhail, my hands hurt.”\n\nFather wheezed miserably.\n\n“Mikhail, my skin is on fire and drips away.” She stopped before him and crouched. Father whimpered and whined like a beaten dog, twisting away from her hands. \n\nShe set her small hand on his cheek. Father squalled and writhed, but couldn’t break away from her. “Mikhail,” she wept. “You are just like him now.” She jerked and began to shrink, to sink, disappearing into the floor. The moment her hand fell away, Father leapt to his feet and ran.\n\nAfter that, he did not ask to see Alexandra.\n\nThis is good, because I did not see her in my dreams after that. I only saw Laika. I spent most nights drifting among the stars with that dear, doomed dog at my side. Imagined or not, the sights were glorious: incomprehensibly beautiful star formations, planets, great multicolored expanses of celestial mists.\n\n\nSometimes I woke, bleary and incoherent, and felt her fur against my skin. But by the time I opened my eyes, there was nothing.\n\nOne winter morning, I woke very early. My stomach growled immediately, and no wonder; Father hadn’t fed me for days. I’d fed Alexander with table scraps and tree bark. \n\nThat, I decided, would change today.\n\nI crept into the kitchen. There wasn’t much; there never was. But I scraped together what little I could, and turned around.\n\nMy grandfather sat at the table, great golden eyes shimmering in his terrible face. “Little bitch. What have you done to your father? He no longer hunts. He no longer eats. He no longer obeys.” \n\nI felt like I was back in his chapel: crushed by darkness, heavy with dread, on the verge of panic.\n\n“Your ability,” said Grandfather, “has not been seen on this earth for a thousand years or more.”\n\nOf course the ability wasn’t of earth; I’d no doubt come across it while sailing through space and breathing stardust. “It’s just nightmares.”\n\n“No. You take the dark things of the world – the fear, the hate, the pain - and channel them into physical form. And that is just the beginning. You will be able to do anything. You will make bodies. Permanent, perfect bodies for me…and for you.”\n\nThe relish in his voice made me sick.\n\nHe said, “Our women have always been weak and talentless. I thought the same of you, little bitch.”\n\nTears pricked my eyes and my bones thrummed as if struggling to break through flesh and run away. But it was no use; destiny had already bloomed between my grandfather and I, heavy and foul with the promise of despair. \n\nGrandfather whispered, “Listen closely, for you will only hear this once: *I was wrong.*”\n\nHe left. I ran to the window and watched him hurtle through the trees as sunrise threatened. Back to his Chapel. \n\nI waited until the sun was up. Then I ran to my room, bundled Alexander in every bit of clothing I could find, and left.\n\nWe followed the path for many miles. Our home was hours and hours from the nearest town; we wouldn’t reach it until long past nightfall. I could only hope that Grandfather wouldn’t notice our absence until the following day. It wasn’t an unlikely hope; Grandfather spent most of his time in the Chapel.\n\nThe second this thought crossed my mind, a glittering dark shape leapt out of the trees and knocked Alexander from my arms.\n\nI caught a blur of twisted limbs and nightmarish hands, of great yellow eyes like flattened moons. Alexander screamed as a torrent of blood splattered across the snow. It sank quickly, melting red canyons through the pristine white.\n\nGrandfather at me, narrow sides heaving. Then he leaned down and tore out Alexander’s throat.\n\nI screamed. Birds took flight and mammals ran through the undergrowth. The piercing note echoed off the mountains. The pain within it should have ended the world, but there was no one to hear and no one to care.\n\nGrandfather grinned. Alexander’s blood and sinews clung to his teeth.\n\nI broke. \n\nI felt it; the crushing weight of sorrow, the almost physical sensation of my spirit tearing and bleeding out into my guts.\n\nI fell to my knees and cradled Alexander’s head for hours.\n\nMy father finally found us around nightfall. He had a heel of bread and an oily chicken leg. He pressed them both into my hands, then left. \n\nI tore the bread into pieces and dropped them, one by one, into Alexander’s mouth. When he did not wake, I burst into tears and hurled the chicken leg into the woods.\n\nThe moon rose into the cruel, dark sky. Stars glimmered through the bare branches over head, creating a breathtaking fractal pattern.\n\nI flopped down beside Alexander, pulling him to my body. He was cold. Terribly cold. I held him anyway, keeping my eyes trained on the stars. My mind detached with great difficulty, like it was trapped in tar.\n\nFinally, it wrenched itself free and sailed upward, disappearing into a silvery sea of sky and stars, rocketing ever higher until I saw the Earth spinning below.\n\nLaika’s rocket zoomed past. I reached out and caught one of the metal bars near the nose. I could sense Laika within: her terror vibrated through the craft and leached into my bloodstream.\n\n“It’s all right,” I said. “It’s all right, Laika. I’m here. When you land, I will help you out and we will play together.”\n\nHer fear diminished, and so did her pain. So did mine. Together we sailed the stars, looking upon the Earth and marveling at the incomprehensible beauty around us.\n\nI woke cold, sore, and in more pain than I can describe.\n\nI sat up. Alexander’s stiff body broke away from mine. I reached for him blindly. A thin scrim of ice covered his eyes. The wound in his throat was an open horror, one I couldn’t look at for long.\n\nI drew my knees to my chin and wept. \n\nAfter a while, something warm bumped my hand. A wet nose touched my palm. I knew what I would see long before I opened my eyes.\n\nLaika’s striped face and dear curly tail made me smile, even through my tears. Stars glimmered through her fur, gently pulsing pinpricks of light.\n\n “What is this?” Grandfather’s voice echoed through the trees.\n\nRage flowed through my blood, exquisitely corrosive. Hate, I learned then, is pleasurable; it is fury and it is the basis of power. \n\nGrandfather erupted from the darkness, scaled skin shimmering like a river under the moon. “You waste your talent,” he sneered, “on a mutt. Not even your own pup! No matter. I will correct you.”\n\nLaika reared up and leapt, snout piercing one of Grandfather’s flat moon eyes. He screamed and shook his head back and forth. Laika fell to the snow, twisting, and quickly righted herself. Then she bit his foot. Her teeth sank through that impenetrable, immortal hide like butter. \n\nLaika was not large enough or strong enough to kill him, but she tore holes in him the way a match scorches holes in paper. Soon Grandfather was on his knees, mere feet from Alexander’s corpse.\n\nLaika came to me, panting, and collapsed in my lap. She bled from a thousand wounds: some small, some undoubtedly mortal.\n\n“Good dog.” My voice broke. I stroked her gently, willing those wounds to close. I was a monster. I’d used Laika just like the others had; calling her down on false pretenses, filling her with hope, before throwing her into the void. “Good girl. Good, good girl.”\n\nI looked up as Grandfather’s good eye slid to my dead brother. Something dark bloomed there: a wicked, corrupted hope. He curled in on himself, twisted body shrinking to a withered husk, and slid down Alexander’s throat. \n\nI screamed as Alexander’s body twitched and juddered. Then he sat up, bones creaking and frozen sinews cracking.\n\nHe smiled. His eyes shone like molten gold in a forge. \n\nLaika attacked again. Alexander’s face curled into a snarl as she bit and tore his skin, exhibiting an energy at odds with her awful wounds.\n\nI watched, helpless and hopeless and hurting, wishing I could detach and fly into the stars once more. Except there would be nothing there for me now; I’d called Laika down from the stars and doomed her.\n\nThe snow crunched behind me. I whirled around. Father stood there, watching me with contempt. In his hands was a sleek, gleaming shotgun.\n\nRelief and horror engulfed me. This was the end. My mind would detach, forever this time. The fear would finally end.\n\nLaika bit down on Grandfather-within-Alexander, who hit her. She whined, but held fast.\n\nFather stalked past me and cocked the gun.\n\n“No!” I screamed. “Don’t hurt her! *Don’t hurt her!*”\n\nFather pointed the gun at Alexander’s head and fired. Blood and viscera and dark, glittering flesh exploded across the snow.\n\nFather fired again, then reloaded, and fired again and again. Alexander’s head evaporated into red mist. Finally his body lurched, and Grandfather – small, bleeding, scaled Grandfather – slithered out of his throat.\n\nLaika caught and held him. Father pressed the barrel of the gun against his good eye and pulled the trigger as the sun broke over the mountains.\n\nFather stepped back. I reached for him, drunk on hope and gratitude, but he recoiled from me. In his weathered face, I saw despair and rage…\n\nAnd contempt.\n\nHe kept his eyes trained on mine as he placed the gun in his mouth.\n\n“No!” I screamed.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. Half his head evaporated, leaving a glistening mass like a fleshy geode. His body stumbled forward a step, then crumpled to the snow. \n\nIt took a very long time for the sun to burn Grandfather down to dirty oil.  Laika held on until the last scrap of skin melted. Then she stumbled to me and collapsed. \n\nI stroked her until her body shrank and sank into the ground, leaving nothing but a scattering of tiny, dim orbs: the stars I’d seen in her fur. I touched one. It was pleasantly hot. I gathered them up and slipped them into my pocket. I went to Alexander’s body – ravaged beyond description, broken in ways that did not see entirely real – and sat with him until nightfall. Then I stood and walked away.\n\nAnd life went on.\n\nAt first, I brought them back from my nightmares  – Alexander, Father, Grandfather, even Alexandra – but I quickly taught myself to starve and eventually kill my ability. It is not a good power; it is born of rage, despair, selfishness, and fear. \n\nAnd I cannot tolerate fear.\n\nBesides, dogs do not have such awful powers.

It seemed almost too simple, too easy. But here he was.\n\nDerek had a kindly face, wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks only added to the softness of his expression. His white hair poking out from beneath his flat cap stood out in the dark night.\n\n“That’s a lovely little patch you’ve planted. I can look after it if you like, I used to maintain the last garden here.” He said, breaking the silence that had followed since his initial words. \n\n“I know who you are. We need you.” Was all I could manage, the mental exhaustion and fatigue from the whole experience had built up, but his arrival was like finishing a bad day working at school. I felt like I could relax again, even if only a little. \n\n“Whats your name darling?” He asked.\n\n“It’s Kat. I live in flat 42 now.” His face lit up as I confirmed my flat number. \n\n“Prudence has gone?” He asked.\n\n“She’s gone. But the whole place is a mess, so many things are happening and the residents are suffering.” I answered. \n\nWe chatted for what felt like hours. Outside with nothing but moonlight. He told me how he used to consider the building part of the garden, a place for him to maintain, the residents just like the plants he looks after. \n\nI explained my whole experience since moving in. I told him about Jamie and I sobbed. Derek held me as I cried and made me feel safe, something I had forgotten the feeling of since receiving Prue’s note. He didn’t interrupt, he just listened.\n\nI told him about Natalia and the cultists, the problems they had been causing. He was particularly heartbroken when he heard that they had used Eddie and Ellie for entry. He had gone before they were born, but remembered Terri as a child and how sweet she was, he was pleased when I told her what a sweet adult she had become. \n\nMy claims that Prudence was the only person who knew how to kill the imposter neighbours were met with a skeptical expression which gave me some hope.\n\nDerek listened to my entire tale with barely a word. When I finished he stood up and asked me to follow him. I was confused, but I did as I was told. \n\nHe walked me to the entrance of the lift. I lifted my arm to check the time on my watch. We had been outside for quite some time and the idea of the creatures being inside made my heart pound and my stomach turn. \n\n“You are safe. It’s 12.32am, there’s no need to worry or to check your watch.” And with that he pressed the “call lift” button. Despite his insistence that I was safe my stomach continued to do gymnastics.\n\nIt felt like forever before the lift finally made the clunking sound that meant it had reached the bottom. I felt my whole body shaking violently as the doors opened, I don’t know what I expected to see, we were in the safe time zone but every time I looked at the life I pictured Jamie’s dead, crunched up body. \n\n“Step inside.” He said.\n\n“I can’t. Please don’t make me.” I begged\n\n“I won’t let anything happen to you. But you need to see something.” There was such sincerity in his eyes as he spoke. I had never trusted someone so completely so quickly, but every fibre of my being told me this man was entirely good. \n\nI stepped inside the lift.\n\nDerek stepped in behind me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder as I hyperventilated. He gently turned me to face the panel of buttons that control where the lift stops.\n\n“What is wrong with this panel? Do you see it?” He asked cryptically. \n\nI studied the panel. Read all the numbers, counting them. I couldn’t see anything wrong. I tried. I really tried, but nothing seemed out of place at all. Everything you expected to find was there and nothing more. I shook my head, barely regaining my composure.\n\n“Can you take us to floor 9 please?” He smiled slightly as he made the request. \n\nI looked back to the panel to press the button, but floor 9 didn’t exist. I was so confused, I had counted the numbers, I was sure of it. Derek must have made it disappear. But the panel didn’t look any different to before. I can’t explain it, looking at it, I would have sworn blind nothing was wrong with it even once I knew, but floor 9 didn’t exist. Derek could see my frustration. It was like the building was now playing tricks on me. \n\nHe walked me out of the lift and sat me down on the bottom of the stairs before he finally began to speak.\n\n“The building is like a living organism. It can seal off parts of the world, and it can open up others you never could have imagined. When those awful people burned that whole floor of residents I was devastated.\n\n“Some wonderful people lived in those flats, both of the usual and unusual variety. But those people had no limit to their cruelty. Whole families burned alive, it was a tragedy that made me so angry. \n\n“I felt so guilty when it happened. I can predict what some of our more tricky residents are going to do and make sure I’m there to help. But those people were nothing to do with this place. I couldn’t see what they were planning, so I couldn’t stop it.”\n\nAt this point I noticed one of the hairless cats had sat between us, Derek looked at it with tears brimming in his eyes, he stroked it and it moved on to his lap. Dereks fingers didn’t burn at all. He continued.\n\n“When it happened the building used its defence mechanisms and sealed off the entirety of the floor. It stopped the fire from spreading and kept the perpetrators there, to die by their own hands.\n\n“The building only allowed the floor to be unsealed once they were dead. \n\n“It took about a week before those awful people turned up again. Asking for sugar at people’s doors, the first few let them in. It was so difficult, so many residents burned alive that I was having to use their remains for my garden just to hide the dead. The entire community were terrified and grieving for those that died. \n\n“No matter how hard I tried I still couldn’t predict them, or see them, so I took Prudence, who at the time seemed a perfectly reasonable woman, to the burned out floor.\n\n“Floor 9, however, had been sealed again. There was no button in the lift, and it always skipped on the stairs. Only no one had noticed. This building really is a magnificent creature.”\n\nI stared at him in amazement through the whole story, I was exhausted but my brain was working in overdrive to process what he was telling me. I had started to stroke the cat too, my fingers did burn, but I didn’t flinch, I found it’s company comforting. He carried on. \n\n“I went back later that night and took the stairs again, alone this time. I think my intentions were clear and the stairs allowed me access to floor 9 for the first time since just after the fire. \n\n“I bought Prudence to the floor within the hour. The stairs had stopped skipping floor 9 for me, although I later learned that when Prudence had tried alone she was not allowed access.\n\n“We explored the floor, walking amongst the remnants of our dead friends belongings. Eventually, we came across one of the soulless arsonists, roaming the halls. It appears that’s where they spend their time when they aren’t out terrorising the residents trying to claim more victims. \n\n“He was disturbed and disoriented to see anyone not like them on that floor. He twitched a little and spat out the sugar line as if it was an automatic response, I almost felt sorry for him. He claimed to come from flat 66. More were approaching behind him. \n\n“Prudence was terrified, she was starting to sweat profusely and back away from the man, but it didn’t cool her down, he was burning her slowly. I felt nothing; See, the stranger things in life just don’t seem to affect me, I’ve never known why. Sometimes I even just know how to deal with them, like it’s programmed into me. On this new playing field, in their domain. I knew what to do. \n\n“I grabbed the man and ran him down to flat 66, 4 doors from where we were standing. I threw him into the flat and waited. The other arsonists were approaching.\n\n“The man tried to exit the flat, that was doorless after the wooden doors all burned to cinders in the fire. But as he reached to door something stopped him. He couldn’t leave, no matter how hard he tried, or how much he screamed. \n\n“Prudence lit up, she grabbed hold of one that had tried to kill her friend, Molly. She remembered the flat number she had claimed to be from and repeated my actions, with a lot more sweating and some winces of pain. It worked again. \n\n“Prudence wanted to go after the rest, but as they got closer I could see the blisters forming on parts of her body, I dragged her out of the hallway and back into the stairwell. We ran. \n\n“She begged me to take her back, kept telling me that the stairs wouldn’t let her, that it was too dangerous. The residents had started to learn not to let them in and we had no casualties at all after we trapped the first two. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a problem I was intending to deal with, but it was around that time that we first learned the council would be building that monstrosity over the top of my garden.” He gestured to the window that just showed some of the neighbouring tower block.\n\n“This left me not at my best, my intuition was failing me when a few months after that, I allowed Prudence and Molly to heard the creatures from the lift to floor 9. It’s one of my biggest regrets. I should never have walked them up there. But I didn’t know she was going to burn them all. She didn’t give me a chance to reason. \n\n“I became mistrusting of everyone and distracted. Not long after I went away for a long while. So I guess the arsonists remained and now they’re threatening you.\n\n“Tomorrow I will go. I will fix the mess I left behind. I am so sorry it’s affected you so badly, I’d love to meet these twins. They sound incredibly brave.”\n\n“They are.” I finally interrupted, “And I want to be there tomorrow. I want to lock Natalia away for good.”\n\n“I can’t allow it. You’ll be attacked.” He cut me off entirely. I let it drop instantly but in the back of my mind I knew I would be there, no matter what. \n\nI went to sleep that night with my mind reeling. I wondered where Derek slept and if he even needed to. \n\nThe next morning I left my flat early, passed the man on floor 5, and sat at waited on the steps at floor 8. I tested it of course, and just like anticipated, ascending any higher took me straight to floor 10. Or 11 depending on if you hit a skip. So I returned to floor 8, and I waited.\n\nDerek hadn’t indicated what time he was coming. But I was ready. I would wait all day and night if I had to. But luckily I didn’t.\n\nDerek was climbing the stairs at around 11am, I had already been there for 3 hours but it had been worth it. He looked particularly unimpressed to see me. His face still looked kind though, even with the sour expression. \n\n“I can’t stop you can I?” He sighed, sounding resigned in his tone. \n\n“Not for anything.”\n\n“You have to promise to stay back. If you get your girl approaches you can do what you need to do, but you have to stay back.” He pleaded.\n\nI nodded and stood up. We ascended the stairs and for the very first time in my new life here I saw the big plastic sign saying 9. The floor that didn’t exist. \n\nAs we pushed through the door it was like entering an entirely new world. Everything was black. Burned to carbon. You could smell nothing but charcoal. Literally nothing but empty shells of homes and flakes of what used to be sentimental objects remained. It was devastating to witness. \n\nIf you’ve ever visited a mass grave site you’ll understand partly how I was feeling. It was sickening, to think of all the lives needlessly lost. But I didn’t get time to think.\n\nNatalia walked towards me. Flying down the hallway. \n\n“How the fuck did you get here?!” She screamed. Her eyes were wide and angry, I started to feel hotter already. \n\nDerek grabbed my arm and pulled me next to him. Making sure to keep a tight hold of my arm. \n\n“Where do you live?” Derek asked her, I started to back away as the sweat dropped from my brow. I desperately wanted to shout out the number, but I couldn’t. I was so hot, I wasn’t functioning properly, everything became so overwhelming I couldn’t remember what Georgia had said, what flat Natalia had claimed to come from.\n\n“I’m not that stupid. I saw what happened to them.” She gestured over her shoulder to what must have been flat number 66, where a man laid on the floor, breathing but looking broken. Just existing in that room. Prudence had been creative with the truth yet again. She didn’t kill them, you can’t kill them. \n\nWhat had Georgia said? I racked my brains as I felt the skin on my face start to sting. I imagined her melting away, it was happening to me. I was next. \n\nAnd then, as my hair started to singe at the ends, it came to me. \n\n“71!” I screamed as loud as I could. I could barely see as Derek grabbed her and ran towards me with her. She was clawing at his eyes and face screaming at him to let go. But he didn’t burn. He just kept hold of her. When he approached flat 71 he beckoned me over. \n\n“You do it. Then get off of this floor.” He was blunt but reasonable, I complied. \n\nI pushed hard. There was nothing but anger in her eyes, she pushed my face hard with her hand as I got her to cross the boundary into flat 71. I felt my skin sizzle and blister. My whole face was in agony, but I didn’t stop pushing.\n\nWatching Natalia try to fight her way out of a door that didn’t exist was both satisfying and humorous. The others had started to approach at the sound of the commotion. I lingered, hoping to watch her suffer but derek shot me one look and I knew. It was time to go, \n\nI ran out the corridor and back into the stairwell. I stopped for longer than I probably should have. But I knew I might not get to see that 9 again and it would be worth it. I waited for Derek on floor 9s stairwell. I couldn’t help but imagine the cultists burning to death the first time around. \n\nI could hear angry screams faintly from inside the corridor, they made me worry about Derek but I knew that really I didn’t need to. It took a while, but he eventually left the corridor and joined me in the stairwell. \n\nHe didn’t say anything, he just looked at me and the third degree burns across my face. He didn’t need to speak, I knew he’d fixed the problem. \n\nWe walked silently back down the stairs towards my flat. I looked back up at floor 9, knowing the building would seal it off for good. It took a few floors to reach floor 7 and I invited Derek in for a cup of tea. He rejected it, saying he wanted to go visit some old friends.\n\nDespite my injuries I couldn’t help but smile, something I’d done was going to help these residents. I stood at my door and watched Derek walk away, pleased that there was some true good in this building. \n\nAfter a few steps down the hallway, Derek started to fade, almost like a cgi ghost in a movie, every step he became more transparent. I felt my stomach turn again, like it had outside the lift. I ran out to follow him. I called after him but by the time I had reached where he’d been he was gone. I walked the entire corridor to the window at the back. I looked out the window into the small concrete heavy garden and hoped to see him sat on the memorial bench.\n\nI didn’t see him, instead I saw Prudence. Hacking at my tiny planted patch with shears.\n\nHow it ends: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cmykhy\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"273":{"title":"Buying a weighted blanket from Amazon was the worst decision I’ve ever made.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dv6c4p\/buying_a_weighted_blanket_from_amazon_was_the\/","flair":null,"author":"barkoholic","selftext":"You’ve heard of them. They started as a tool to help calm autistic people and people with anxiety and insomnia. Over the past few years they’ve grown into a popular household item, and with good reason. They’re comforting. \n\nWe’d pay just about anything for some comfort. Do you ever notice how that’s most of what we spend our money on now, us single guys? Why do we constantly crave to be comforted?\n\nMy life wasn’t particularly uncomfortable. Not then. I had finally gotten back track with reality after the disappearance of my wife and kids two years ago. I’d sold our little house in the suburbs, gotten a cheap apartment close to my job, attended all the therapy appointments the police and caseworkers recommended, and gone back to work. I still couldn’t sleep for more than an hour or two a night, even with the medications they gave me, but that was okay. The worst of it was over. Shock and grief can only last so long. \n\nI got one anyway; ordered the thing off Amazon. In queen size, like all my bedding, even though my queen no longer slept in it. \n\nIt arrived ridiculously late. I’m a Prime member, and I selected the free two day shipping. But it at least had gotten there, so I didn’t send a complaint, despite the state it was in after its long journey - not in the familiar smiley cardboard box, but in a shapeless lump haphazardly placed halfway on my front doorstep, halfway in the parking lot. It had been clumsily wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string, and possibly kicked the whole way here, from the look of it. \n\n“It’s like a quaint, rustic thing,” I announced (to nobody in particular) as I dragged it into my apartment. “A present from grandma, back home, uh, on the ranch!” \n\nBut even talking to myself couldn’t convince me. It looked like a bomb, delivered straight off the set of an action movie. The package was beaten up, stained, and the rough jute string was frayed and nearly falling apart. It looked singed in several places, too. It took me two hours, three gin and tonics, and a hearty microwave dinner to work up enough courage (or suicidal depression) to actually open the thing. \n\nThe blanket was bundled into a poorly-folded cube, held together by another length of the same string that had bound the paper. I wasn’t impressed with its packaging, but the blanket itself looked alright - plush, quilted blue microfiber with thick seams - and felt like it was the right weight. It smelled normal; you know that clean but vaguely chemical-ish odor new blankets have. \n\nI checked the tag, wondering if I ought to clean it, but the ink was smeared and blurry. It seemed risky to throw it in the washing machine without knowing the correct settings to use, so I just threw it over my duvet and went about my business. \n\nAt around midnight I decided to give it a try. I had nothing left to lose; I’d spent hundreds of dollars on my bed over the past few months; the newest and best quality memory-foam adjustable cooling mattress, thousand count Egyptian cotton sheets, customizable-filling pillows, and none of it had brought me a single good night’s sleep. Honestly I expected the same to happen that night, but it was fun to pretend. \n\nI slid between the cool sheets and pulled the blankets up over me. The new blanket was a bit lumpy, but I knew from reading reviews that this was normal due to shipping, and would smooth out over time. The weight was immediately noticeable, and to my surprise, I felt...comforted. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes, I imagined my youngest two had crawled into bed with us, and were laying on top of me, suppressing giggles as they tried not to wake me up. An artfully folded section of the blanket at my back became the familiar bulk of my wife beside me, and when I opened my eyes again it was ten in the morning and I was late for work. \n\nI’ve never been so thrilled to receive a write-up. \n\nThat weird chemical smell didn’t really fade, though, and gradually it became more noticeable. By the end of the week I could smell (or imagined I could) the strange, neutral odor on my skin, even after a shower. By the end of the month, it had become unbearable. \n\nI took it to a dry cleaners, thinking that I’d been lazy because I was so enamored over my renewed relationship with sleep. I was ready for the elderly Korean woman behind the counter to judge me over the stink. I had my excuses rehearsed; work was crazy, I’d had it in my car and forgotten, and I’d had Indian food for lunch and forgotten the leftovers in my car over the weekend, which had amplified the smell. \n\nBut I didn’t have a chance to recite this story. She only waved a handheld metal detector over my blanket and said, “Filling wrong. Can’t clean. Try spray with Fabreeze! You can get on Amazon!”\n\nI couldn’t imagine what about the filling could be wrong, and I told her so. Sure it was still a bit clumpy from shipping, but Amazon had listed the filler as polypropylene, and all the reviews recommended dry-cleaning. \n\n“Metal,” she explained, then shooed me out the door with twenty pounds of smelly quilt in my arms. \n\nAnother month of beautiful, comfortable sleep went by before I couldn’t live with the smell anymore. People had begun to comment on it at work. Megan, my manager, had tactfully suggested I check my laundry machine to see if maybe a rat had gotten in there and died or something. That was my last straw. \n\nI came home determined to get rid of the blanket and buy a new one. But you know what happens when you lose your entire world, with no answers? You start to cling to things. You hoard them. Because you can’t lose the comfort they bring you. \n\nI tried six dry cleaners before I found one who spoke enough English (through a heavy Boston accent; but you can’t have everything) to explain it to me. \n\n“Sometimes they fill these with glass beads,” he said. “The factories that make the beads, they‘ll lose a screw or some metal filings in the batch, and it all goes into the blanket. Machines in factories, you get me? Yeah, so what you can do is cut the seam a little and dump the balls into a bucket or the bathtub or something. Throw the blanket in the wash, hang it up to dry. Then you just pour ‘em back in and sew it up.”\n\nI told him I didn’t know how to sew. \n\n“You can get a funnel off Amazon for a few bucks,” he said, and shrugged at me in a particularly apathetic sort of way before turning back to a pile of stained panties. \n\nI did exactly that. They took a week to ship it, which was annoying, but it was a bank holiday that Monday so the delay made sense. \n\nArmed with my funnel and a bucket, I pulled the edge of the blanket over the bed and cut a tiny hole into the seam near the corner. I expected the beads to come pouring out in a clattery flood as soon as I dropped the corner into the bucket. Instead there was a single, loud thump as a lump of something metallic hit the plastic. \n\nI peered into it and saw a gold circle. A wedding ring with a fingerprint carved into it, and an inscription on the inside that I couldn’t see because a chunk of meat and bone were still inside it, but I knew what it said. It said “to love’s eternal glory”. It was my fingerprint on the band. \n\nMy mind went blank and I lost control of my legs, forcing me to sit heavily on the edge of my bed. The motion tugged the blanket over another few inches, and more of the filling came out. This wasn’t a flood, it was more of a...heave, like the blanket was vomiting up pieces of crumbling, dry flesh and bone. Like a cyst being squeezed, thick clumps of horribly recognizable stuff squirted out into the bucket. My oldest son’s teeth clattered loudly against the sides, and I saw flashes of silvery fillings from the cavities caused by gum disease he’d inherited from his mom. \n\nThere was a scrap of almost-bleached-white Hello Kitty band-aid wrapped around a tiny knuckle joint, and I remembered how my daughter had scraped her finger knocking loudly on her brother’s splintered bedroom door, and how she’d smiled through her tears when she saw the special, fun band-aid her daddy had put over the scratch. \n\nI’d been sleeping for two months beneath the heavy weight of a thousand mummified pieces of my wife and children’s bodies. \n\nThe cops couldn’t trace the package, even though they tried. The security cameras in my apartment complex showed an unmarked brown van with no license plate, which dumped the package directly from the window onto my front step. There was nothing to track. \n\nAmazon’s lawyers provided evidence proving they’d packed and shipped the correct (boxed and labeled) blanket. Let me be fair to them; I must say that they offered me a prompt refund. \n\nIn store credit. \n\nBut I won’t be buying anything off Amazon ever again. I’ve gotten rid of my Echo; that was the first thing I threw out, along with all my new bedding, and I canceled my Prime membership.

The ritual helps me think however, and I’d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.\n \nShe was a forum member, who’d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she’d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.\n \nWe spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.\n \nQuestion One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?\n \nI’ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn’t seeking return.\n \nI’d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she’d told us as much. I’m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we’ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I’d kindly ask you find another way to help.\n \nQuestion Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?\n \nIt’s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I’d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn’t yet have an answer.\n \nI decided to take a drive while I figured it out… I’ve been in my car for the rest of the night,\n \nAfter an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I’d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.\n \nThere was no denying that the place resembled Alice’s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I’d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice’s steps towards Rob Guthard’s street.\n \nOK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I’d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn’t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I’m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn’t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.\n \nAlice was always the smart one.\n \nWhat I’m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn’t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn’t a mirror shop this time of course, that’s only the 34th turn when you’re coming the other way, in fact I’m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should’ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion… I don't think she was there at all.\n \nThe moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I’d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.\n \nIt wasn’t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice’s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I’d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I’d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice’s account, but I’d seen no first hand proof of the Left\/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I’d know soon enough.\n \nI crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn’t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.\n \nI took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.\n \nAhead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.\n \nI’d always known it was true.\n \nIn the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night’s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn’t have a response.\n \nIn the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you’re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.\n \nAnd now… here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.\n \nThough perhaps the street’s not as quiet as I thought.\n \nI’ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn’t the woman in grey this time.\n \nThough it’s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I’ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice’s logs.\n\nHe watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.\n\nI wonder if he can help.\n \n[Part 1](https:\/\/redd.it\/7asz8x)\n \n[Part 2](https:\/\/redd.it\/7bkk41)\n \n[Part 3](https:\/\/redd.it\/7cf4h8)\n \n[Part 4](https:\/\/redd.it\/7dmuvp)\n \n[Part 5](https:\/\/redd.it\/7fdu9c)\n \n[Part 6](https:\/\/redd.it\/7h9jzb)\n \n[Part 7](https:\/\/redd.it\/7jabqd)\n \n[Part 8](https:\/\/redd.it\/7loh1l)\n \n[Part 9](https:\/\/redd.it\/7q3x6e)\n \n*****\n \nThe Left\/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20\/02\/2017\n \nThe Left\/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.\n \nI remember reading it on my lunch break.\n \nI remember it made me laugh.\n \nThe submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.\n \nI was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.\n \nSomewhere around page three, between the description of the game’s rules and the exhaustive list of “Required Skills”, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.\n \nThey’d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn’t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man’s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard’s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.\n \nLater that day, I found myself in the editor’s office making a case for it. They didn’t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn’t be gone long.\n \nIt’s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven’t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.\n \nI still largely agree with this assessment. It’s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I’ve chosen to type up the following account in full.\n \nWhoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.\n \nI’m quite sure this will be my final instalment.\n \n*****\n \nThe moon has broken, and in my entire life, I’ve never witnessed an evening so still.\n \nThe air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.\n \nYet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can’t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That’s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.\n \nA few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.\n \nThe stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It’s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.\n \nAt least that’s what I thought it was at first. It didn’t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That’s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.\n \nI was driving through the centre of a lake.\n \nThe water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I’ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It’s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I’m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.\n \nI lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I’ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don’t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I’ve quickly grown used to the process. If I’ve learned anything from the road, it’s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.\n \nA few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  \n \nI press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.\n \nThere’s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It’s a miracle I’d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. \n\nAs I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.\n \nIt’s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There’s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.\n \nWith a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water’s edge.\n \nThe body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She’s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who’d tried to repel me from the road, who’d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.\n \nIt seems her ramblings weren’t completely void of fact. It’s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.\n\nIt doesn’t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.\n \nAs I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.\n \nI find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I’m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.\n \nMy hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie’s exposed arm.\n \nDigging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie’s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.\n \nThe promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie’s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake’s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I’d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it’s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.\n\nMarjorie wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She’d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road’s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body’s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road’s influence wasn’t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. \n \nHer other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.\n\nAfter a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob’s foldable spade.\n \nA long few hours follow. I’ve never dug someone’s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.\n\nIt takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It’s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it’s an act I don’t have the right to perform. \n\nOnce it’s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.\n\n**MARJORIE:** You.\n\nEven before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There’s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch’s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it’s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.\n\nReluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie.\n\nUnlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.\n\n**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I… I gave him up for you.\n\n**AS:** I’m… I’m sorry Marjorie, I don’t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.\n\n**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!\n\nI don’t know quite what to say. It’s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie I… I didn’t mean you to.\n\nMarjorie’s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.\n\n**MARJORIE:** Oh… oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now… now you’re here.\n\nMarjorie’s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.\n\n**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!\n\nMarjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I’m struck by an idea I’ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.\n\nMarjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. \n\nThere's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. \n\nPerhaps we must choose our eternity.\n\nAfter all my time on the road, that’s possibly the most terrifying notion I’ve encountered. \n\n**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.\n\nMarjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I’m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I’ve never seen her wear before. \n\n**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn’t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. \n\nMarjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.\n\nI hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.\n\n**AS:** I don’t know if this can help but… stranger things have happened.\n\nAs she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we’re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. \n\nBefore I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.\n\nA few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It’s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I’ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.\n\nIt’s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I’m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.\n\nThe sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. \n\nI back up against the Wrangler’s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.\n\nSquinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night’s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. \n\nStaring through the shuddering fracture, I’m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.\n\nIn the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.\n\nThe being is unlike anything I’ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature’s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.\n \nSomehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.\n\n**AS:** It’s you… isn’t it. You’re the voice I’ve been hearing. You’re the one who brought me here.\n \nThe bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler’s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity’s smouldering core.\n\n**AS:** Can I get an interview?\n\nThe creature doesn’t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.\n\n**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.\n\nEach reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.\n\nIn the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.\n\n**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?\n\nThe being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.\n\n**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.\n\n**AS:** Like whatever’s through there?\n\nI gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature’s spiralling form.\n\n**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.\n \n**AS:** But it wasn’t her… she thought she was seeing her own future… but it was-\n \n**VOICE:** It was you.\n\nThose three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow… a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.\n\nI hadn’t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, \n \n**AS:** She didn’t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them… the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I’d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?\n \n**VOICE:** Yes.\n \n**AS:** But… why? You toyed with so many lives across… across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?\n \n**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.\n \nIt speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.\n\nThe creature continues.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity… and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.\n \n**AS:** Then why didn’t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn’t lift a finger… after everything that happened-\n \n**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.\n \n**AS:** As they… needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They’re all gone. Do you not care at all?\n\nIn response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.\n \n**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.\n \n**AS:** You’re saying I don’t understand death?\n \n**VOICE:** You don’t.\n \n**AS:** ... That still doesn’t make it right.\n \n**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.\n\n**AS:** What even are you?\n \n**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you’d understand.\n \n**AS:** That's not good enough.\n\nThe creature doesn’t respond, as if it doesn’t feel it needs to. So far it’s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there’s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature’s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.\n\n**AS:** And what if I don’t want any part of this?\n\n**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.\n\n**AS:** That’s the only reason?\n\n**VOICE:** Do you need another?\n\nIt doesn’t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it’s speaking of. Ever since the city, I’ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.\n\nI’ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.\n\n**AS:** No… no, I don’t trust you. I don’t-\n\n**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.\n\nThe creature’s already stark glow starts to intensify.\n \n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you, on every turn … across every moment of your journey.\n\nOne of the creature’s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.\n\nIt’s as if I’m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you questioning.\n\nThough we can’t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature’s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.\n\nA second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I’m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest… a silent radio by my side.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you struggle.\n\nThe second window closes. The creature has made its point.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you fight… to make your way here.\n\n**VOICE:** You will not turn around. \n\n**AS:** You make it sound like I don’t have a choice.\n \n**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.\n\nAs much as I’ve grown to detest the creature’s presumption, in that moment, I know it’s right.\n\nWhat it’s saying is true. I’ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn’t arrived at all, I’d already be heading out over the bridge. \n\nI’m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob’s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there’s no denying the impulse is there. It’s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona… and it’s buried deeper than I’ve ever wanted to admit.\n\n**AS:** Can I… do I get to say goodbye?\n \nThe entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.\n \nPicking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.\n \n**AS:** How… how long do I have?\n\n**VOICE:** Long enough.\n \nThe entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. \n\nAs it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.\n \n**AS:** I’m still not certain I trust you.\n \nThe being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. \n \n**VOICE:** … I remember.\n \nA moment later, the being is gone.\n \nI stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity’s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.\n\nIt could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.\n\nIt was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I’d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. \n\nI’d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose… or about what I might inevitably become.\n\nA short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.\n\nIf you’ve been reading from the beginning, you’ve finally caught up with me.\n\nI hope you’ll allow me a few personal messages.\n\nTo Rob. I hope you’re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I’ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn’t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.\n\nTo my mum and dad, I’m sorry I won’t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can’t bring myself to face you. I can’t imagine the pain I’ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I’m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.\n\nAnd finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I’m sorry. I always thought I’d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn’t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I’m not going to.\n\nBut I wish we could have been friends for longer.\n\nIt feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard’s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. \n\nLike so many other things, that’s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone’s ever been, I know exactly what’s going to happen next.\n\nI’m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. \n\nAnd from there I’ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.\n\nTo a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is."},"275":{"title":"My friend and I made “ghost pornography” for fun.

It started off with sexy cosplay, then I photographed Suicide Girls style, and finally, when I had people up to pay enough, solo porn.\n\nI used to live in a crappy kitchenette, but once I was successful enough, I was able to afford a nicer place. Things got better when I moved in with my new roommate, but also weirder.\n\nI’m not using our real names or our artistic names here because I’m scared as fuck.\n\nMy new roommie, Savannah, was a cheerful and sweet girl. Her perky personality had flocked plenty of followers and fans, way more than I had myself, and she was making some good money; for instance, she was a homeowner at 22.\n\nHer place was huge, and she decided to rent her extra room for an attractive price, as long as the other resident was fine with her vast collection of sex toys being displayed in the living room.\n\nI thought that was hilarious and we immediately hit it off, so the other resident became me. The fact that we were both nude models helped our friendship, but to be fair I had met some other girls in my field before, and most of them were a stick in the mud.\n\nSavannah was nice, tidy and amazingly respectful of my personal space. She didn’t act like she owned the place, even though she literally did. I had spent a good few months before things started to go south.\n\n“So, Ayla”, Savannah approached me over breakfast. “Would you be willing to collab with me? I have a request for a private two-girl job and I thought it made sense to invite you first since it will be so much easier to arrange our schedules.”\n\nI wasn’t doing much, just my nightly streaming, my regular sets and my sets for patreons. I asked more about the job.\n\n“Well”, she laughed. “I have to tell you it’s one of a kind. It’s nothing dehumanizing or anything, but it’s weird as fuck. This guy… he jerks off to shadows. He wants us to pretend we’re fucking them.”\n\n“Fucking the shadows?!” I asked, and laughed loudly. She confirmed, laughing too. It was insane, but relatively harmless, like when some guy paid me 5 grand to legally bind me to not show my feet to any other man but him for a whole year. So I only take my socks off to shower and it’s been months since I don’t go to the beach.\n\nWhen Savannah told me how much the client was willing to pay for such a thing, I was immediately in.\n\n“It will be so embarrassing, but kinda fun, right?” I said.\n\n“Yeah, and with that I can finally stop taking private requests and focus on other things”, Savannah replied, happily. She’s sort of a do-it-all artist – model, photographer, painter and so on.\n\nA few more e-mail exchanges with [shadowfucker@\\[redacted\\].com](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com) and he had approved of me and discussed the details with Savannah. He wanted two videos a week – on Mondays and Thursdays, and each should be at least 30 minutes long.\n\nA very reasonable request, considering that, with my share of what he was paying, I could drop everything else and still live comfortably.\n\nHe would send us the equipment before the first week, then outfits every two weeks.\n\nI was the one to receive the large box from UPS, as Savannah wasn’t home. I knew she had a P. O. box to avoid disclosing her real address, but this one came straight to our place.\n\nWeird, but considering how big this client was, I could understand her making an exception for him, and didn’t say anything about it.\n\nLater that day, we opened the box. It contained some light strobes, a few large but hollow wooden and metal objects, eight sets of costumes – wigs included –, a photograph and a small package marked *otherworldly condoms*.\n\n“Wow, imagine being this lunatic!” Savannah grabbed the little package laughing, then opened one of them.\n\nThey looked nothing like regular condoms; they were more like those plastic bags you use to freeze stuff, but the material was so much thinner and slightly iridescent.\n\n“That’s probably something he made up to make it more realistic, right?” I asked, then read the instructions aloud. “When having sex with the shadows, make sure to protect your whole groin with otherworldly condoms. They can unfold to thrice its size.”\n\nThe outfits were actually cute and we spent some time deciding when we were going to use each of them; the client had perfectly guessed our sizes.\n\nThen the photograph finally caught my attention.\n\nIt showed the right way to arrange the equipment on the room, but funnily enough, the room depicted was incredibly alike to Savannah’s studio – our third bedroom. Unlike me, she didn’t often film\/shoot in her own bedroom, preferring to use a mostly neutral room where she could set up scenarios or just take cleaner pics and videos.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel that the picture had been taken exactly in her studio – *at the very place we lived.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe day of our first video came – a Monday. It didn’t take us more than 15 minutes to set up the whole equipment on the studio exactly like the picture showed. The objects projected large shadows on the room, and the lights were set to slowly move on their own, so our interaction with the shadows was like the strangest sexy dance – but at least we weren’t standing still for half an hour pretending to fondle the same empty spot.\n\nDespite thinking that it was wacky, Savannah was a professional and she diligently used the otherworldly condoms as requested. I used them as well, and for 35 minutes, we pretended to fuck shadows.\n\nI felt utterly ridiculous, but being used to doing solo videos, I pretty much knew how to do it. The color of the lights and the outfits really helped set a soothing mood that made it all less shameful.\n\nSavannah then turned off the cameras and looked at me.\n\n“It wasn’t awful, was it?”\n\n“It was okay”, I agreed. I could make a fool of myself for some good money.\n\n“Do you want to shoot a second one and end this week early?”\n\nBefore I could reply, her phone buzzed loudly.\n\n*From: <Unknown Number>: Remember, shoot twice a week. Separately.*\n\nWe stared at each other in confusion.\n\n“Maybe there’s a mic hidden in the equipment?” I suggested. \n\nWe searched the whole room but found nothing.\n\nI didn’t think much about it. Rich people are controlling. They know things, always. The client knew when we were going to film the first video, and of course he figured we would consider doing everything on the same day instead of having to disassemble the set and reassembling it again.\n\nI went about my day, and nothing strange happened. Savannah seemed much more alive because now she had time for her hobbies, and I was doing well enough to start sending my family some money, something I had wanted to do for a long time.\n\nWe were to send him the first video on the day we recorded the second and so on. On Thursday, Savannah told me the client loved our first video, and looked forward to the next. To get us a little more comfortable with our weird thing, we had some wine and put on jazz music.\n\nThis time things went smoothly, but I kept hearing some humming while we pretended to fuck the shadows. I was sure it wasn’t coming from the music.\n\nI asked Savannah and she didn’t hear anything. “Maybe you’re a bit drunk? Slow down on the wine next time, home girl!”\n\nFor our video number 3, I was completely sober and asked Savannah to do it without music. She agreed, and in the total silence, I still heard the humming.\n\nIt was a humming that wasn’t there before, and it didn’t come from the light strobes either. I was so focused on it and intrigued that my face looked really unsexy and Savannah’s editor called to ask if there was an issue.\n\n“She just keeps listening to some humming. Yeah, I’ll tell her to see a doctor. Think you can mostly show her from behind? Cool, you’re an angel!”\n\nSavannah looked more worried about me than anything else, so I promised to see a doctor. Maybe something was wrong with my ear – even though something only felt off while we filmed the videos; at least now I could afford some high-quality healthcare.\n\nBetween the filming of videos 3 and 4, I got my ears checked, but they were perfectly normal. Savannah reiterated that it was totally cool if I wanted to give up on this freaky fetish-video thing and she would get another girl for that, no hard feelings.\n\nBut I didn’t feel like the videos were the problem. There was just this weird *thing* I couldn’t quite understand.\n\nOn video 4, Savannah was tipsy and seemed to be really enjoying herself. I felt a little guilty that she was clearly overcompensating for the fact that I was worried and gloomy on the previous video.\n\nThe humming evolved to whispers. And for the first time, I heard – no, it was more like understanding for the context, with the intuitive side of my brain – a few words.\n\n*“I actually like this.”*\n\nAt last that’s what I foretold that the whispers said. It probably sounded more like *sfslsosls dlsowllss swowllls*.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOnce again, I didn’t tell anyone. I was almost convinced that I was actually being crazy. It was just an eerie feeling because I was stripping to and groping empty spaces twice a week.\n\nOn the Friday after recording video 4, we got a new box with outfits. There was another photograph, instructing us to rearrange the lights and boxes to, I imagine, create different shapes with the shadows.\n\nI couldn’t restrain myself this time.\n\n“Savannah, don’t you think this pic looks exactly like your studio?”\n\n“Yeah, that helps a lot, right?” she smiled, and then slowly realized what I meant, her smile withering. She grabbed the photo from my hand. “Oh, now that you said it, it’s quite alike. But of course no one broke into the house, right? I think that’s a standard room.”\n\nBut she sounded shaken.\n\nI think that’s the reason why she completely forgot the otherworldly condom.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe made the preparations as usual; changed the setting as the photo instructed, dressed up, put on our wigs and make-up. \n\nThe whispering immediately started, and for a moment I got lost in it, trying to understand. A buzzing sound, then another.\n\n*“There’s food today.”*\n\n*“It tastes good.”*\n\nThen Savannah screamed.\n\nI didn’t realize she wasn’t wearing the otherworldly condom either – not until I saw her groin covered by the blackest of blacks, then her legs disappearing into the darkness of the shadows.\n\nLike she was involved by long and thick pieces of deep-black fabric, her torso and head disappeared too. She didn’t seem to be in pain, but in shock – everything was so quick and uncanny.\n\nI reached out for her, but there was nothing there.\n\nMy hands grasped thin air.\n\nI immediately turned off the light strobes, turned on the normal lights and moved all the boxes around. They were still hollow as ever and Savannah was nowhere to be found.\n\nI then searched the whole house fruitlessly. \n\nIt’s ludicrous to say that, but shadow-people took my friend.\n\nI sat on the floor and cried, worried about Savannah and about what I would tell the police about her disappearance.\n\nI was a mess, and decided to cancel my live-streaming that night for personal reasons.\n\nAs soon as I opened the browser, an e-mail notification popped on my screen.\n\n*From: <*[*shadowfucker@\\[redacted\\].com*](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com)*>*\n\n*It’s not your fault that your friend neglected my one rule.*\n\n*I like you, Ayla. The editor tried to cut off your face from the last couple of videos, but I do realize you are accomplishing something I was never able to: learning the shadow-people language.*\n\n*Keep working for me and all your financial concerns will be taken care of, especially regarding your teenage sister and her two children. I’ll deal with everything regarding Savannah as well.*\n\n*Find me a new second girl for the videos, the cash and outfits will keep coming. It’s up to you to instruct her to always use the otherworldly condoms – I don’t mind feeding them*[.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PPoisoningTales\/)"},"276":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 3!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"Part 1: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nWell, once again, you guys have blown me away with your staggering amount of responses to my stories! There's no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I'm just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I'm going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend's stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.\n\nAlright, so the common questions I found you all had:\n\n* I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality some of the things I've mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it's best if I just don't discuss too much. I will say that I'm in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We're talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.\n\n* There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys my friend has a story that I think you'll all be very interested in. I'll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don't want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it's possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I'll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.\n\n* As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer and training courses, or what the qualifications are. I've been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It's a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn't want to do anything else. \n\nAlright, let's move on to the stories:\n\n* The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you're mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. \nThis case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn't really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and shes got something in her arms. She's screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he's sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously we can't just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own. He's still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it's not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what's going on. She's rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she's holding, it's covering her with blood. That's when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what's going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she's holding. It's her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he's covered in scratches. Now, I've seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who's standing by. I tell him that it's a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he'll deal with it.\nIt took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can't have him, that he'll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He'd died instantly from the trauma to his head.\nI was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he'd fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I've been on.\n\n* I haven't seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren't that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you'll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They'll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who'd gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: 'God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.' I guess that's not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.\n\n* I honestly don't know how I'd forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that's happened to me. I guess maybe I've tried so long to forget about it that it just didn't come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don't ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That's why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that's ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don't really like talking about it much, but I'll do the best I can to remember it all.\nAs I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call: a four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family's campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do; my kid would never wander away, she's so good about staying close, she's never done anything like this before. We assure the parents that we'll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you've done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job. \nWe search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she'd be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we're not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we're trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we're all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going.\nAbout an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one's found the little girl. Most of the time, we won't search when it gets dark, but because we don't have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy. We keep close together, and we're calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I'm hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it's a whole different beast. But we're not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point. \nWe're about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I ask him if he's heard a response, but he just tells me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounds like a kid crying. We both call the girl's name and listen for any kind of response, but it's just this really faint crying.\nWe head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn't right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can't figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl's name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out. \nThe crying is on a loop. It's the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It's exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It's the only time I've ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. \nWhen we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about. I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we've never found, but frankly I doubt we'll ever find anything. \n\nOf the missing persons calls I've gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and no body ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we've found that have become infamous in our team:\n\n* A teenage boy who's remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.\n\n* The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found. \n\n* The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park. \n\n* The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she'd vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. There were no suspects ever identified.\n\n* The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.\n\n* A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.\n\nNow on to  a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you're in luck: he's had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn't have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do. \n\n* My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years, he started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out.\nHe said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn't feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn't feel anything. The only thing, he said, that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything. And there didn't appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn't feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed the stairs; he said it was terrifying, because the way they'd been stigmatized, he wasn't really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around. But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you'd get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head, at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn't mention what he'd done.  \nBut, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong.\n'You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head.\n'Because we didn't find her. The dogs lost her scent.'\nMy buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he'd been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he'd be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he's never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.\n\nMy buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there's never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn't found right away, they're either never found, or they're found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can't possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.\n\n* The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn't done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter. \nHe was out on a training op in the snow, on one of the higher peaks, when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern. About twenty yards away, he found the kid's body, laying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice, that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain. \nNow, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid's stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He's never really gotten over that one.\n\nThe last story I'll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. \n\n* They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It's unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he'd heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. \nHe heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion's territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog. When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him.\nIt was almost night by this point, but he said in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed, and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, 'and impossibly long step' toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn't even say anything, he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn't mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved. \n\nI'm going to end this entry here, since it's turned into a huge wall of text. I'm going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I'll be gone until early next week. I'll be meeting with a  lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I'll be asking around about any stories they'd like to share. I'm so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I'm back from this op, I'll continue to share them!\n\n**EDIT: Part 4 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"277":{"title":"I found the bunker of a prepper family who went missing three years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/11txaos\/i_found_the_bunker_of_a_prepper_family_who_went\/","flair":null,"author":"ChristianWallis","selftext":"Dr Daniel Vance was a smart man. Too smart for his own good, maybe. Forty years old, a lecturer in fluid dynamics with a mind made of shapes and numbers. No one knows why but one day, on a whim, he crunched the numbers on the apocalypse and came to a troubling conclusion. He didn’t share exactly what it was he’d deduced, but given that he immediately quit his job and liquidated his many assets, it’s fair to say it wasn’t positive. Swept up in the wake of this tremendous upheaval was his wife, a twenty-four year old PhD student who had grown infatuated with Daniel some time before. She loved the strange bear of a man who could just as easily build a log cabin as he could explain the idiosyncrasies of an asteroid’s orbit. Speaking to Daniel always left you with the profound impression he was right, so when he told her what he wanted to do, she agreed.\n\nFifteen years and five children later, the Vances were living in the distant woods just beyond my hometown. They were enigmatic, richer than the Pope, and extremely serious about their prepper lifestyle. But they were also funny, easygoing, and incredibly compelling to speak to. Larger than life survivalists who swept into town with bizarre requests that thrilled local businesses. Vast quantities of cement, iron, lead, and steel were all shipped through the remote mountains so that the Vances could build their shelter. The advanced methods they used to keep it secret were legendary. Daniel had once spent six months earning the licence necessary to drive HGVs up to his compound so that no one else would lay eyes on it. And on one occasion when a company had refused his request for GPS tracker-free vehicles, he bought them out wholesale so that they had no choice.\n\nSo when they stopped appearing in town during the pandemic, when requests for food and goods stopped and all contact was dropped, most attributed it to lockdown. They had a bunker and had spent their entire lives training to be self-sufficient in the face of civilisation’s collapse. Even Alexander, the youngest at just three, was already collecting firewood as a chore, and learning what local plants were edible. Most of us just assumed that if anyone could ride out Covid without breaking a sweat, it would be the Vances.\n\nThe reality turned out to be something else.\n\nWhen the worst came to light, we discovered that Daniel had used the pandemic as an excuse for a dry-run. The family intended to spend six months in lockdown and essentially beta test their fallout bunker. Three months in and the Sheriff received a distress call on the radio. Coordinates were provided by the hushed voice of a sobbing child that most assume was Alexander, even though that’s never been proven.\n\nThe police arrived and found the bunker still sealed. It took hours for emergency responders to cut into the door, all the while efforts were made to contact the family within but to no avail. Once inside, police were left dumbfounded. There was no one to be rescued. No bodies. No survivors. There was evidence the door’s locking mechanism had failed and trapped the Vances inside with no way out, but if so where had they gone? \n\nBeds and cots lay everywhere with mouldering yellow sheets, buckets close to hand with stains all around them. Some doors were barred, others smashed to pieces. There was even evidence of makeshift quarantines and, in places, what looked like violence. The police, usually a fantastic source of gossip, were not forthcoming until the town demanded answers and the Sheriff was forced to offer only the barest of outlines. \n\n*An outbreak of a waterborne illness had struck the Vances down not long after they were locked inside and unable to seek help. Rumours of contagion were overstated, fuelled by the unrelated rise of Covid. Whatever contaminant had killed the Vances, it was non-organic in nature. No need to panic. The Vances loved-ones had been notified. The bunker was going to be demolished, and we could all put this terrible tragedy behind us.*\n\nOf course we still had questions. A thousand of them. Why hadn’t the family called for help? They had radios, computers, smartphones too. They were survivalists, not Amish. And where *were* they? What had happened to their bodies? Why hadn’t they simply left? We shouted these and more at the town meeting but the police simply refused to comment. For most of us the excitement lasted another week or two until we realised we weren’t getting answers any time soon. Besides, the pandemic was in full swing and most of us had other things to worry about. The tragic story eventually faded until it was just one of those awful things in the town’s history that we didn’t talk about. I was as guilty as anyone else of just forgetting about it.\n\nI certainly never expected to find the bunker out there in the woods, faded police tape still on the open door that hung wide open with scorch marks around the lock. It stood out in the woods like someone had cut a hole right in the fabric of reality, the darkness so deep and black it almost ached to look at. The sight of it made my heart drop into my stomach. It radiated pain. Does that make sense? I think some part of my lizard brain picked out details that wouldn’t become apparent to me until I got closer, like the bloody finger streaks that stained the handle from where someone had scrabbled furiously at the lock without success. And the tiny viewing window had been smashed with a hammer that still lay nearby. I needed only to glimpse it to imagine the family taking turns to stand there and scream into the woods desperate for rescue. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, I would have run.\n\nBut I’d gone there looking for my dog, and my light revealed a few wet paw prints making their way down the dusty concrete tunnel. Half Bernese and half collie, Ripley is the sort of dog who trembles in my arms when a storm buffets the windows and needs his paws held when we brush him. I love him. I do not have much of a family, or a wife, or even many friends. But I have Ripley, and I could no more have turned around and gone home to an empty apartment where I would have to sob my grief away than I could flap my arms and fly. He was my dog and I’d raised him since he was a puppy, and I wasn’t going to leave him out in those woods.\n\nI went in after him.\n\nI didn’t know what to expect, but I knew it wouldn’t be good. Whatever the police had found, they’d not only kept most of the morbid details to themselves, they had also lied. The bunker was not demolished, or even sealed off. In fact, looking at the occasional blue latex glove tossed aside and the one or two broken police-issue flashlights, it seemed like the last people inside had been in a hurry to get out. Given this was where seven people had presumably died, I assumed it was *someone’s* job to clean it all up. But the corridor looked largely untouched. Just a few metres in and manic writing started to cover the walls, the desperate scrawls of a lone survivor left there to be rediscovered like cave paintings. Most were deliberations on how to get out. Diagrams. Blueprints. Equations and formulae. All focused on the door and the circuits responsible for its faulty lock. I instinctively assumed they belonged to Daniel and that he’d been the last to die. What a God awful fate for a man to outlive his children. And yet it got worse. Slowly the writing changed from equations and plans to a desperate scrawl. The same few phrases repeated over and over. \n\n*Five doors. Five. Not six. Six. Didn’t make it. Didn’t make it. Six doors. Six.*\n\nIt seemed like the kind of thing you’d find in an asylum. A psychotic rambling punctuated only by six paragraphs right at the end. Each letter was impeccably neat, and each small paragraph was topped with a beautifully drawn Christian cross.  \n\n*Elliott Vance aged fifteen. A gifted guitarist. He liked boys even though he thought I did not know. I loved him with everything I had. He would have made a great man.*\n\n*Alicia Vance aged fourteen. She liked to paint and to shoot. She had her mother’s mean streak. It would have served her well in the future.*\n\n*Elijah Vance aged eight. The smartest of us all…*\n\nThese were Daniel’s memorials to his family, and seeing the words lit up by my torch was a haunting insight into the overwhelming despair he’d endured. He must have realised he wouldn’t get the chance to speak at his family’s funerals or to write their obituaries. This was his last desperate way of making sure the world might one day know them as he did - as real people.\n\nThe words marked the end of the tunnel, standing adjacent to a trapdoor in the ground. It was not open but the tunnel came to a dead end immediately afterwards and Ripley’s prints disappeared at the hatch. I feared he might be in danger, but still I stopped and looked at the bunker door twenty metres behind me. The once gloomy forest looked so bright, even on this cloudy day, the air dotted with rain. A part of me felt like I was leaving the whole world behind as I began to climb the ladder down.\n\nI entered a large circular living space that was packed with furniture and little nooks and crannies. The walls were covered with folding beds and tables and every inch was multifunctional. A dining space could become a sitting space, which in turn might be where someone slept, or even exercised. It all depended on what particular bit of furniture you unfolded or unclipped or unfurled. Seven people in close quarters, nowhere near enough privacy, it made sense they went with this cluttered overlapping use of space. But it was still a large room, bigger than most studio apartments. And there were a few corridors that led deeper into the Earth telling me the bunker had unseen depths. \n\nI looked for some sign of my dog and soon found his trail, but this far from the rainy copse Ripley’s prints were starting to fade. After barely a few metres they petered out vaguely in the direction of a nearby door. I wanted to follow but stopped myself from rushing onwards. It was unlikely Ripley was getting out any other way, and I’d do us no good getting hurt myself. I decided to take a look around and quickly spotted a dinner table. \n\nIf I needed proof the police had not bothered with a clean up, this was it. The plates were still out, the food rotten to a strange blackened husk. A child’s hat lay across one place-setting, the once-creamy fleece turned a sickly green and yellow. The chairs had their backs reinforced with wooden beams fitted with long grooves so that something the width of a nail could slide into them. And on each of the cushions were foul smelling stains that looked oddly like an ass print. I touched one with gloved hands and the material crackled audibly. Whatever it was, similar stains were on the cutlery and plates, and there were even handprints of it placed firmly on the tablecloth. At first I thought it was blood, but that wasn’t quite right. It was too contained to be from leaking blood. On the back of one of the chairs a stain tapered exactly where a woman’s waist would be like a near perfect silhouette. I shivered as I remembered that Miranda Vance had always been a slim woman and wondered how she had left her imprint on the grey fabric.\n\nUsing my torch, I saw that these stains repeated in the oddest of places. Yes, there were some on beds and blankets and even patches of plain floor exactly like you might expect in a room full of sick people. But why did one stain on the floor bear such a strong resemblance to a child huddled in the foetal position? And why was the same stuff all over the tv remote, and on books on shelves, and board games too. Everything from sofa cushions to DVD boxes to piles of dirty laundry were covered in the same dried brownish material that gave off a foul coppery miasma.\n\nI found the jigsaw particularly baffling. Someone had set up another table with four chairs, all modified with the same back support as those by the dinner table. And a jigsaw had been lain out with four separate piles, but only one was depleted. The rest looked largely untouched, almost like someone had portioned out pieces for three other people who had absolutely no interest in going along with it. Maybe Daniel had tried to keep up morale while the family were sick? God help me, if that were true I couldn’t help but imagine the poor man sat there with his loved ones close to death, desperately trying to encourage them to click their own pieces into place while they faded in and out of consciousness.\n\nSomething about that room emanated madness, and the longer I stayed down there flicking the bright disk of light of my torch from one detail to another, the more I wanted to leave. One door had wooden beams nailed across it. One sofa had been partially disassembled. Multiple beds had been burned. And all the light bulbs had been removed and put in a box on the kitchen counter top. Looking up at the ceiling, I finally had some insight into why the police were so confident the Vances had not survived despite never finding their bodies. Someone had jammed a human finger into one of the empty sockets, almost like they’d expected it to glow with the flick of a switch.\n\nWhat was it about this place that had caused the police to leave and never return? Not to even take that finger and test it for signs of illness, or even just to confirm who it belonged to?\n\nI decided it was time to hurry up and find my dog. People had died in that place, and while I’m not superstitious, I can’t be the only sceptic who has done the calculations in his head and realised it costs nothing to be respectful of ghosts. That bunker was cramped, terrifying, and the air stank so bad I started to worry I’d get sick myself. It served no one any good to linger. But I’d be damned if I’d just walk away and leave Ripley to rot down there. It’s not like he could climb a ladder and get out on his own (even if I wasn’t entirely sure how he’d gotten down there in the first place).\n\nSummoning what little bravery I had left I called out and broke the silence, something which felt like a terrible taboo in that God awful place, like screaming in a graveyard.\n\n“Ripley!” \n\nI waited and hoped to hell I’d hear the pitter patter of his paws, but for the longest of moments there was only the kind of silence that makes you wonder if someone or something in the darkness is holding its breath trying to look like just another patch of nothing. Biding its time until you finally turn around and show it your back…\n\nThe TV came on with a blurt of white noise that was so loud and so sudden I cried, threw my arms up, and nearly fell backwards onto a rolled-out sleeping bag that looked like it had spent a week in the sewer. By the time I realised what had caused the noise, I could already hear a tinny rendition of Daniel Vance’s voice.\n\n*…I realise the issue here. I need to emphasise just how little I understand anything that’s…*\n\nI frowned at the screen as I approached. It showed a greenish infrared view of the bunker with Daniel upfront, and the dinner table behind him. It was grainy and hard to see, but I could clearly tell that his family were sitting in those chairs. \n\n*…Miranda was first to fall ill. Looking back it makes perfect sense. Miranda often went into storage to fetch food for cooking and we found it behind one of the refrigerators. So that’s–ah shit..*\n\nOne of the figures in the background slumped onto the table with a loud *clank* and sent a plate spinning off onto the ground.\n\n*Shit shit shit*, Daniel muttered as he got up and grabbed the woman by the shoulders and sat her upright. *Miranda never did like my cooking!* He snorted a laugh as he fussed with something at the back of the chair. *The rods are much better than tape. All those hours spent taping them upright to the chairs. Never worked. But the rods… they fit right into the spine and with a little modification I can just slot them into the chairs. That way everyone is able to join in for dinner. I’m working on something similar for family game night.* \n\nDaniel wandered over to the camera and with a grin he lifted it from the tripod and scanned the dinner table. What I saw nearly made me drop my torch. \n\nHis family were long dead. Gaunt faces. Missing noses. Lips that had receded to reveal awful grins. These were corpses, plain as day, even when viewed through such a low resolution image. The only thing that made them seem remotely alive was the way their eyes still reflected the infrared back so that they glowed in the dark. And yet Daniel seemed oblivious to it all. He tousled Elliot’s hair. Kissed his wife on the cheek. Run a hand across one young girl’s shoulder. He even picked the young Alexander up from his high chair and I assume he coddled him. I don’t know for sure because I looked away, unwilling to see the poor boy up close.\n\nEyes averted from the screen, I couldn’t help but pan my torch across to that same dinner table and shiver as I finally realised what all those stains were. Not quite blood. But close. *Liquefying flesh.* Left alone for months, Daniel had not put his family’s bodies to rest. Instead he had moved them around from place to place and puppeted them, living life as if nothing had really changed. Looking at where those stains had settled I saw a clear pattern emerge. He had put them to bed. He had set them dinner. He had propped them up to watch TV, or gave them their favourite books. They even sat there as lifeless husks while Daniel waited for them complete a fucking jigsaw. The idea horrified me to my core.\n\n*…back to work. It’s obviously not part of the original designs. No room on the other side, not on the blueprints. Elliot didn’t believe me and why would he? I made every inch of this place, but I did not install that door in storage on the bottom level. I checked the cameras and some of the photos I took during the build and the wall is just blank. But the door is there now and it must lead somewhere. I don’t know when or why it opens, but it does and the next time I’ll be ready. Because I have to know what’s on the other side, and why it did this to us. Alone down here, often all asleep at once. Anything could have slit our throats and been done with it. But it didn’t. It took its time and I have to know why!* \n\n*It took our radios and computers and phones. One by one. None of us noticing until it was far too late. I kept telling the kids they needed to take better care of their things, and even as they complained I just assumed the phones were lying behind some shelf. Where else could they go in a locked bunker? But it wasn’t the children at all. Looking back there are so many signs… who kept taking away the lights? Who kept draining the batteries in our torches? How long did we live with it before we finally realised we weren’t alone? Was it here every step of the way?* \n\n*A door out of nothing that leads to nowhere, at least most of the time. Because I know for a fact it does not always open onto a blank wall. There is something behind it. I can hear it shuffling around in there, wet breath rattling in its lungs, a horrible sound I hear roaming these halls when it thinks I’m asleep…*\n\nI listened to Daniel, fascinated by this strangely compelling rant, when movement caught my eye. An infrared camera running in the dark, its image a roiling mess of uniform noise. What was it I’d seen? I paused the tape and rewound. Squinting, I saw two pinpricks of light in the darkness just over Daniel’s shoulder. Slowly, the image resolved itself in my mind. I knew what I was seeing and it turned my blood to ice.\n\nMiranda Vance had turned her head, and her lifeless eyes glowed as she fixed them on the back of Daniel’s head.\n\n*…not even any point leaving at this stage. I’m no doctor, but that door is giving off enough radiation to… well, to kill a family of seven. If none of us had touched it… Being in the same room is risky, but not lethal. But given how sick we’ve become, it’s pretty obvious our curiosity got the better of us, one by one, and we all got too close. Or maybe not. Maybe that thing on the other side came through and did this. I don’t even kn… wait… what was that?*\n\nDaniel turned and the camera stopped recording. The image it froze on was of a lone man, bright as a star in the camera’s lens, facing off against unknowable darkness broken only by six pairs of white, glowing eyes.\n\nI became painfully aware of my position relative to the table and I had the painful premonition that if I turned, those chairs would not be empty. I would see the Vances, all of them, Daniel as well, waiting for me. Heads turned. Bodies left to rot for years in the dark. Behind me something shifted. It breathed. Loud. Quick. I knew what it was. *I knew*. It came at me so fast that when I felt something hot and wet touch my hand I screamed, only for the presence to suddenly recoil. But then, without hesitation, it leapt at me and bore me to the ground.\n\nI wept as Ripley licked my face. He was shivering and, worst of all, silent which was not normal. He was not a quiet dog, not when greeting me and not when excited like he was now. But whatever he’d seen down here, he clung to me and dug his paws into my shoulders like he wanted to be cradled over the shoulder, something he has been too big to do for years. \n\n“Oh you fucking idiot,” I cooed in a soft whisper and even in the dark I could feel his tail wagging. Joking aside, I felt nothing but relief at finding him. “Let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nI picked him up, straining a little under the weight but refusing to give into tired muscles, and made for the ladder. It wasn’t easy climbing the three or four rungs to the hatch, but I managed it and gave the hatch a shove. First one hand, then two. Again and again, with everything I had, but still that hatch refused to budge.\n\n“Shit!” I cried while pounding at it with my fists, but all I achieved was a sore wrist. The hatch had jammed when, somehow, the handle had been snapped clean off. Now I’d need a pair of pliers or something to cut through the metal bar locking it shut. My fingers couldn’t move it, nor could I brute force the hatch open. The metal bar was an inch thick and, at the very least, I’d need some tools to get at it from this side. \n\n*At least it’s fixable*, I thought as I climbed back down and caught my breath. On one wall I noticed a simple diagram of the bunker made in chalk. It had three floors. The bottom was storage–Daniel had mentioned that before, and I noticed that he had drawn through it with a large red X–and the top floor was labelled *Quarters*, where I stood now. But the middle floor was labelled workshops and it was there I realised that I’d find what I needed.\n\nThere was one door that opened onto a concrete stairwell and, standing at the top, I shone my light down the spiralling guard rails unsure of what it was I hoped to see. There were only harsh shadows and the sense of something foul rising up on the air. A smell that tickled my throat and burned a little in my lungs. Had the police even gone down this far? Had they seen what I’d seen on that TV and just left? Somehow I thought it was unlikely that had been enough to send the entire Sheriff’s department running, so was it something else that had done it. Something that had been enough to terrify dozens of armed men. Something that was almost definitely down there. \n\n*The door…*\n\nI went down quietly. At first I considered leaving Ripley behind, but after losing him the first time I decided I’d rather risk it just to know that he was right next to me. Besides, he was being quieter than I was, and I didn’t feel much like going down those stairs on my own. He accompanied me with only the quiet click clack of his paws on concrete, a sound I found deeply comforting as I barely managed to keep my torch from shaking in my hand and my breathing steady.\n\nDown one floor and I found the workshop exactly as you might expect. A large space filled with generators and fuel and water tanks and boilers and heaters and pretty much anything and everything that you’d need to survive but which you couldn’t put outside due to fallout. Wires pipes and tubes ran from one end of the room to the other and even years later, most of the machinery still hummed in the pitch black emptiness, an idea I found deeply unsettling. Taking one look at that strange tangle of harsh shapes and industrial figures looming out of the walls and floor, I shivered and looked around, quickly finding a small area Daniel had cordoned off for his own use. About a fifth of the total floor space, there was a large workbench and some seriously high end machining equipment, all very well used. Lathes. Buzzsaws. Drills. Belt sanders. Welding torches. Everything a man needed to do-it-himself.\n\nAnd Daniel had been busy.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what it was he’d been working, but there was an arm on the bench. It sat atop a pile of papers that had slowly turned brown over the years until the whole thing looked like it had been soaked in tobacco spit. On the whiteboard was a faded but still visible diagram of what looked to me like a ball-and-socket joint. I thought of the tape, of Daniel’s little mechanism to keep his family upright, and then looked at the arm and suppressed a momentary gag reflex. I don’t know if Dan had been working on posable limbs, or just a way to put the decomposing remains back together after they’d started to fall apart, but the size of the arm suggested a pre-teen child, and he’d left it out on the surface like it was a disassembled clock. It was also missing a finger. *Just how fucking crazy was he?* I wondered as I pinched my nose with one hand and began overturning boxes looking for a hefty pair of pliers, or maybe a hacksaw. Ripley backed away from the noise, but once I made sure he wasn’t going anywhere I carried on grabbing and pulling at box after box hoping I’d find what I was looking for. Anything to break that fucking metal bar.\n\nIn the end I managed to get a pair of bolt cutters, a crowbar, and a heavy duty pair of pliers. One went in my pocket, one went down the back of my jeans, and the other was clutched in my fist, too large to be tucked away in my clothes. The bolt cutters felt hefty in my hand which was a bit of comfort, but that feeling didn’t last long.\n\nSomething moved in the darkness, out there in the twisted jungle of shadows cast by all those pipes and wires that ran from one machine to the next. A figure moved. Thin, but unmistakably human in its outline. I couldn’t help but remember what I’d seen on that tape. Surely it couldn’t have been real? Maybe Daniel had rigged something up. Some fishing wire and a motor, maybe? The idea that those bodies had been moving on their own… I couldn’t be sure of that, could I? It was a frightening idea, one my mind had latched onto out of sheer panic. That was all…\n\nAnd then I saw them. A pair of white pin-pricks reflecting back at me from the depths of that cluttered room. Ripley, already behind me, head nuzzled into my leg, pushed even closer against me and let out a barely audible whine under his breath. The behaviour of a dog who was terrified, close to pissing himself with fear.\n\n*Just a bit of metal*, I told myself as the light shook so violently in my hand I struggled to see straight. *Just two shiny bits of metal…*\n\nThey blinked and began to come towards me. If I had any doubts left, they were dispersed by the sight of a pale white hand emerging into the light.\n\nI ran straight to the stairs and went to climb them, but only one or two steps in and I saw something gripping the handrail on the top floor. A mouldy clump of flesh only just recognisable as a fist, the flesh withered until the fingers were basically bone. Without meaning to, I brought my light up out of habit and I saw the bloated face of a hairless corpse glaring down at me. I couldn’t even tell you if it had been a teenage girl or the sixty-year-old Daniel, either way I instinctively turned and found another body shambling towards me out of the workshop. I was trapped. Nowhere to go. By the feel of warm fluid on the back of my leg I could tell Ripley had finally pissed himself. An adult dog, tail between his legs, shivering like a puppy and desperate to be picked up. God I needed him to just stay together for a little longer. I couldn’t take him in my arms, but I couldn’t leave him behind either…\n\nWith nowhere to go I ran down and entered storage. There was the temptation to stop once I hit the bottom. Down here the air was thicker and the sounds of my breathing were muted, somehow distant. But I only had to look back up to see three pairs of eyes glaring down at me, so without giving any of it much further thought I barreled down the corridor and stumbled onto a door at random. Opening it, I saw what looked like your standard storage room, only most of the shelves had been overturned and the food left to rot on the floor. One or two shelving units were still upright though, and their shelves were covered in tall opaque boxes that made them a fantastic hiding spot. That, I decided, would have to be where I crouched down and turned off my light.\n\nI was already inside when I realised that wasn’t all that was in there…\n\nThe door *almost* looked normal. I could see why Daniel must have been confused by it because it looked a little bit like all the other doors down there, but it was different too. It was too tall and too wide, about a foot and a half off the ground, and the metal rusted in its entirety like it had aged out of sync with everything else down there. All around the jamb was a profusion of wet soppy moss like the kind you find hanging off trees in a swamp, and every few seconds the door would leak something strange and oily, like the kind of thing you find in a parking lot on a rainy day. Of course that wasn’t too strange in itself, but the leak was horizontal, defying gravity so that every few seconds a large glob of the stuff would whip across the room and *slap* into the wall opposite creating a puddle about the size of a man that defied all reason.\n\nRemembering Daniel’s words about radiation, I instinctively inched away from this puddle and the door on the opposite wall, backing myself into the darkest quietest corner I could while I pulled Ripley behind me and hoped to hell he wouldn’t give me away. Once I was in there I turned off my light and waited.\n\nI must have taken longer than I’d thought to hide spot because it was barely two seconds later when a few figures entered the room. It was pitch black after I’d turned off my torch, but they made enough noise to let me know that at least two of them had stumbled in after me. I stayed there, unable to see anything, not sure if they were heading straight for me or just getting ready to leave, forced to hold out and let luck decide my fate. When I finally heard something scrape against the wall barely two feet from where I stood, I gave up and switched my light on, desperate to know what was coming for me.\n\nThe sound had been terribly misleading. \n\nDaniel Vance was no more than six inches from my face.\n\n“Get out,” he hissed from a toothless and cracked mouth. A living corpse just like the others, somehow a flash of intelligence remained in those wide, terrified eyes. \n\nAnd then I heard it. The creaking of a door. And without even thinking I turned the light and saw it on the wall. I saw *it* open, and behind the strange steel there was more than just plain old concrete. Much more. I saw a raging gullet of flesh. A ringed tube of pulsing muscle lined with teeth the size of hands. A spiralling descent into madness. Hot foetid air washed into the room, buffeting me and the rotting corpses, all of us paralysed by what we were seeing, even if for most of the figures beside Daniel and myself, they didn’t have eyes to see with.\n\n“What the fuck…?” I muttered, unable to take my eyes from the flesh tube beyond that doorway.\n\n“It’s coming,” Daniel whispered as he grabbed me with one fist and hurled me out of the room. I hit the floor and skidded along a slick fluid left by the Vance’s footprints, the smell of which turned my stomach. Perhaps the worst detail was that it was cold. I don’t know why, I’d just expected whatever oozed them off them to be feverishly hot. But it wasn’t. It soaked my shirt like I’d fallen into a muddy puddle.\n\n“It’s coming.”\n\nThis voice wasn’t Daniel’s. I couldn’t say for sure, but it sounded like a child’s whisper. One by one the bodies shuffled over to the open door and knelt before it. I don’t know why but I got the impression the others had lost pretty much everything left of their minds, but Daniel remained aware. He looked back at me once more and spoke before he pressed his head to the floor in supplication with the others.\n\n“The only thing we did wrong was being *here* for it to torture. It didn’t need a reason, just an opportunity. Leave. It won’t let us go. It won’t even let us die. And if it catches you, it won’t let *you* go either.”\n\nHis forehead kissed the dirt. \n\nAnd then something reached through the door and gripped his head in its palm the way you or I might pick up an apple.\n\nIn full panic, I ran over and grabbed my dog and the bolt cutters and I ran like my legs were pistons, machines whose signals of exhaustion and fatigue could not slow me down, or cause me to fall. I had to move. I had to leave. The hand that had grabbed Daniel… the sight of it flushed my mind clean like some kind of enema. It hurt to see the image replay in my mind but there was nothing else in my head echoing around except the sight of fingers with one too many knuckles, and nails as large as a smartphone.\n\nI reached the top floor and nearly collapsed from breathlessness, but I wouldn’t let myself stay down for long. I crawled over to the ladder and climbed up and immediately went to work trying to cut the metal lock. It was hell with just one hand, the other clinging to the torch that I kept frantically pointing at the door behind me, and it wasn’t long before I fumbled one too many times and dropped my only source of light.\n\n“No no no no…” I mewed. But there was no time to look for it. I had to get out and I had to get out fast! I couldn’t see but I was sure I could hear something climbing up those stairs. Not the steady *thump thump* of human feet. No this was different. This was a rapid pitter patter of a spider, maybe. Something with hundreds of feet or hands, or God knows what, skittering along the floor and walls and ceiling, pulling itself along with a body whose mere shape would offend God.\n\nUsing all my strength I leaned hard on the bolt cutters and, at last, the bolt gave. I threw the hatch open and got just enough ambient light to see Ripley hovering at the bottom of the ladder, growling ineffectually at the doorway. I crouched down, scooped him up, and fled up the ladder so quickly that my muscles turned to jelly at the top and I fell over onto hands and knees. But still, I was out. The long corridor covered in writing was ahead of me, and at the very end a doorway capped now by the tired blue light of a full moon.\n\nRipley needed no encouragement. He whipped down the corridor with canine speed and I followed at a broken and stumbling crawl, eventually shouldering past the open door and collapsing onto the forest floor.\n\nFor a few seconds I drifted in and out of consciousness, but when I looked up and saw the canopy overhead moving–the branches backlit by a full moon–I snapped awake and glared down at something gripping my ankle. The hand had reached out of the dark and seized me and was slowly dragging me back into the Earth below. Whatever it was, most of its body lurked out of sight in the shadows behind the doorway, but the hand that crushed my leg was the size of my torso with an arm that looked like it belonged to a mole rat.\n\nI struck it with my own fist. I dug my nails in. I cried and kicked and screamed, but nothing could stop it. From behind the door, something like a face grinned and leered at me with joy. It was taking its time, sure enough, pulling me in so slowly that it gave my mind all the time in the world to appreciate the nightmare that awaited me. I think if, in that moment, you’d given me a gun, I would’ve shot myself because God help me I couldn’t escape the look in Daniel’s eyes, how he’d knelt to worship this thing like a man who knew that hope or pride or joy or anything with even a hint of goodness to it was so far out of reach for him it might as well be a dream. How long was this thing going to keep them down there? How long did it intend to keep *me!?*\n\nI wept like a child, feeling like my mind was slowly cracking as I tried everything to stop that fucking pulling me into the shadows. I kicked at the earth. I dug into it using my hands looking for a root or a pipe or anything to hold onto. Nothing, *nothing*, I did would slow it down.\n\nI was no more than a foot from the doorway when Ripley reappeared.\n\nA dog afraid of hoovers and plastic bags and doors that move on their own. A dog who once got stared down by a particularly feisty rabbit who stopped mid chase and turned around, baffling the predator on its tail. A dog you couldn’t even watch scary movies around…\n\nAnd he lunged at that arm like he was a wolf, like he’d always been one. And while he didn’t quite break the skin, the pressure was enough to make the thing’s grip weaken and I slid my leg out. Unable to stand, I knelt and grabbed the dog and pulled as hard as I could and now that fucking thing bled at last as the pressure of the jaws and the sliding teeth ripped into its flesh. Together, at last, Ripley and I were let go and sent rolling backwards head over hells.\n\nI wasted no time waiting or looking or processing. I heaved the dog to my chest and crawled until I passed out, making it maybe half a kilometre away. Only when I could no longer see the door did I let myself fall to the ground face first and gave up consciousness.\n\n\\-\n\nThe doctors said I had pneumonia, which I suppose made some kind of sense. I might have even believed them were it not for the Sheriff’s visit, asking strange questions of me as I lay in bed about what I may or may not have seen. I dismissed them to the best of my ability. I wasn’t interested in chasing that particular nightmare down, figuring out if it had been real or not, at least not while I lay there half-drowning in my own infection. To be fair, I had at least some sympathy for why the police had done so little to seal that place off. I have, on occasion, thought about going and doing the job myself, but to this day I still have nightmares about being pulled into the dark beyond that door. Not just the bunker door, the one I narrowly avoided at the end, but the one *below*. What I saw was a kind of madness, I’m sure of it, and I often think of Daniel’s words. \n\n*It didn’t need a reason, just an opportunity*.\n\nSomehow, the Vances were that opportunity. Maybe they built their bunker on a leyline, or a weak spot between dimensions, or the site of former Satanic rituals. I’m not sure it even matters. They went into the dark thinking it’d be a safe place to wait out the world’s troubles, but something had been down there waiting for them, waiting for a chance to get at a family of seven people, to lock them in and deprive them of escape and slowly take from them everything it could.\n\nI’ve moved since then. Couldn’t help it. It wasn’t just the memories you see. It was the short-wave radio I kept in my basement. Something my father passed onto me when I was just a boy. God I’d forgotten about it… at least until I woke up one day to the sound of it blaring white noise down in the dark.\n\nAnd buried in that sound was the faint whispering of a man, his voice barely recognisable, but unmistakably *his*.\n\n*…let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go…*"},"278":{"title":"When I was a kid, my dad kept a second family in our basement.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/it8166\/when_i_was_a_kid_my_dad_kept_a_second_family_in\/","flair":"Child Abuse","author":"hercreation","selftext":"Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds… but it was all I’d ever known.\n\nI knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I’d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.\n\nI knew that every morning, he’d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.\n\nI knew that each Christmas, he’d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.\n\nI knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young – maybe five – when I finally found the words to ask: “Mommy, why can’t I play with the people in the basement?”\n\nMy mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.\n\nI’ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can’t quite explain.\n\n“We don’t talk about them,” she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. “You don’t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.”\n\nShe paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, “Daddy needs them too.”\n\nThat night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn’t know that I knew, more shocked – frightened, even – to find that they didn’t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn’t want me to tell anyone at school – anyone at all, really.\n\nAfter that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I’d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I’d always noticed that she was… distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that… as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I’d ruined my parents’ marriage.\n\nBut I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious – the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.\n\nI wanted – *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.\n\nAnother change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know… there’s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTo avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn’t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad’s car wasn’t in the garage and my mom’s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.\n\nAnd then, I knocked.\n\nIt was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life’s greatest – and most terrifying – mystery.\n\nI jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate… like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn’t any have time to waste.\n\nMy mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, “hi.”\n\n“Hi.”\n\nIt was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.\n\n“I-I’m Ricky. What’s your name?”\n\nA long pause.\n\n“Lila. My brother’s is Isaac, but he doesn’t talk so good. But he’s still little. Mommy says he’ll start talking when he’s ready.”\n\n“There’s three of you down there?”\n\n“Mhmm,” she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. “Daddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there’s four.”\n\nMy eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else… the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.\n\nAnd like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to – *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn’t really know my dad, didn’t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila’s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?\n\nAnd why wasn’t she allowed to come out of the basement?\n\nOver the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her – she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn’t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.\n\nAnd at home, I had Lila.\n\nAs we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.\n\nThe unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.\n\nLila lamented that she wasn’t allowed to go to school, that she couldn’t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most– homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.\n\nShe said she’d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn’t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually… I couldn’t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so naïve… I didn’t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.\n\nI stopped trying.\n\nI stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead… *compartmentalized*.\n\nConfined to the basement of my own mind.\n\nAt home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I’d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I’d hear her scream. Sometimes I’d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I’d hear her crying – awful, painful sobs – while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.\n\nSometimes she… she would call out my name. I’ll never forgive myself for this – I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to – but I ignored her every time.\n\nWorst of all, though, was when she started knocking.\n\nI was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.\n\nA quiet knock… but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.\n\nMy blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.\n\nI hopped on my bike and didn’t come home until dinner was on the table.\n\nThat night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.\n\nShe wasn’t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom… all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I’d be greeted immediately by the knocking.\n\nBy then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn’t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila’s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn’t let on.\n\nShe didn’t stop.\n\nSleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and – most of all – terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend’s – now my *only* friend’s – house unannounced just to escape Lila’s knocking.\n\nHis parents clearly didn’t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me – broke *everything*.\n\nA blow far more powerful than he could’ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.\n\n“My mom says you’re a *bastard*, that your mom’s a *whore!*”\n\nI had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.\n\nI had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: “Mom… am I a bastard?”\n\nI had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.\n\nI had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.\n\nI had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.\n\nBut, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally – *finally* – told me the truth about Lila, about Dad’s second family in the basement.\n\nI was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.\n\nThrough choking sobs, she told me about my dad’s old family, the one he’d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they’d made, the one that gave her the best thing she’d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad’s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.\n\nAbout how they couldn’t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless – “like a heavy backpack, mom?”\n\n“Yes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.”\n\nThat Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he’d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn’t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.\n\nYet another difficult question: “but… why do they have to stay in the basement?”\n\nI found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.\n\nI was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn’t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn’t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn’t imagine doing what she did.\n\nMy dad’s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad’s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.\n\nI don’t live in that house anymore… I’m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal – even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid – but it’s all I’ve ever known. I love them… all of them.\n\nI still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations.

We knew it was anything but a buyer’s market, but we were sick of paying triple what a mortgage would be in rent every month.\n\nI’m sure this story is familiar to some of you and we went through every stage of disbelief, anger and finally apathy after every competitive offer we put together was blown out of the water by a multinational investment corporation. \n\nI’m not mad about the process anymore although it left me questioning where society was headed. \n\nHOW IS THIS LEGAL!! I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PAID OFF DEBT. I GOT A GOOD JOB. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO STILL GET PRICED OUT THE FUCKING CITY I GREW UP IN!!! \n\nPerhaps some anger remains. But after setting our sights on the city’s less desirable neighborhoods we finally got our home. \n\nOn June 1st we moved into a 4,500 square foot colonial. \n\nIt had hardwood floors that patinated like leather and the frosted plaster trim gave the ceilings the look of a wedding cake. The basement was a different story. It wasn’t just unfinished; it was a dank hole in the ground and scribbled on the walls were strange spirals and crude faces.\n\n“Kids.” The realtor had said like she knew who drew the markings. “Fixing up the basement would be quite the value builder!” \n\nSo, sure, the kitchen had composite counters and the basement needed a sign above the entrance that read, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here” but we had a home. And a damn big one at that.\n\nThe catch was that it was a stone’s throw from the freeway and that the area was known for its crime more than anything else. Angie said it was just a steppingstone, we’d bank a year’s worth of mortgage, hope the housing market keeps rocketing and move again in a year. \n\nThere were some flaws in her plan, mainly money, but I didn’t say anything. I figured we’d both adjust to like it there. \n\nThe first few weeks went smooth and me and the wife got to unpacking and introducing ourselves to the neighbors. Maybe it was the threat of crime and that there was comfort and purpose in knowing who you lived next to, but whatever it was our neighbors were incredibly friendly. \n\nWe felt at home quick and while there were some shocks, we made games out of them to take the fear away. \n\nWith the pops that permeated the night we had the game where we guessed whether the sound was fireworks or gunshots. When we passed large turds one of us would point and we played \n\nhuman or dog. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple weeks at this game we became experts at differentiating between these. Gunshots carry the sharp crack of the sound barrier being broken while fireworks go boom or pop. As for the poop let’s just say that we hadn’t seen any dogs large enough to lay landmines around town.\n\nThere was a homeless problem there for sure, but they minded their own business. Our neighbors seemed to see right through them. They’d act as if they were ghosts. Like they weren’t even there. Hell, everyone did. \n\nI’d smile and say hello in passing. The least I could do was treat them like human beings.\n\nOne night after a movie I was at the sink washing the popcorn bowl. The window above looks out to our backyard which was heavily wooded for a city lot. When it was dark out, I could only see a sliver of what was outside beyond the reflection of myself in the glass. \n\nI frowned at the shadow of a tall dark stump. I don’t remember a tree there. I swayed on my feet to see past my reflection. \n\nIn between the bushes, nearly out of sight, a man was standing still, staring back at me. My heart leaped and I dropped the bowl where it crashed in the sink. \n\n“You okay in there, honey?” Angie shouted from the living room. \n\n“Yeah.” I kept my eyes on the man and said nothing to Angie not wanting to alarm her. “I’m gonna take the trash out.”\n\n“Ok.” \n\nI walked by the trash without touching it and opened the back door. \n\n“Hello?” Outside the wind was blowing hard and the branches of the buckthorn the man stood behind were waving wildly as if to warn me.  \n\n“What do you want?” I stepped forward to try and show I wasn’t scared but it was the tepid step of prey like I was better planting my weight to run.\n\nThe man said nothing.\n\nI took another step forward more confidently this time but jumped when my movement activated the motion light. \n\nI composed myself and yelled. “This is private property! If you don’t leave I’m calling the police!” \n\nNow this was the emptiest of threats and everybody in the neighborhood knew it. The cops made a point to show up an hour late if at all. \n\nThe man walked forward a few paces to where I could see him better. He was very tall and wore a heavy wool overcoat that stretched all the way to his ankles.  \n\nHe kept walking towards me, my brain was shouting but I froze in fear.\n\n“What do you want?”\n\nHe stopped just in front of me. A white scar starred across his black skin just below the chin. He was at least six-foot-six but the coat that ran the entire length of his body made him gigantic. His face was recently shaven and gaunt.\n\nHe held out his fist at arm’s length and when he uncurled his fingers, cupped in his enormous palm was a pill.\n\n“I don’t have any drugs.” I said.\n\nHis face didn’t change any. There was no want or question in his eyes. \n\n“You want me to take it?” I pointed at his hand but still his expression was static.\n\nI reached out and gently plucked the pill from his palm. I held it between my forefinger and thumb. It was just a pill capsule, whatever had been inside had been emptied.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked again.\n\nHe opened his mouth revealing the severed stump of a tongue and then he widened the enormous whites of his eyes. He began to mouth something but being tongueless I couldn’t tell what. But my blood cooled because I felt certain it was some kind of curse.\n\n“Please,” I murmured. “Please leave.”\n\nHe turned and stepped into the night and I watched the bushes sway in his wake as if he were a giant parting his way through the woods. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next day was Saturday and I was determined to find out if anyone knew about this tall man. I walked to the strip mall and asked some of the homeless in the area, but as soon as I began to describe him, they all looked at the ground and shook their heads. \n\nThe pattern was repeated with every other homeless person I tried to talk to. On my way home, I stopped by two men working on a car at the end of a driveway.\n\n“Hey,” I started over to them. “This may sound a little crazy, but do you know of a tall fella around here that wears a giant coat?” They both started laughing. “Sorry to waste your time.” I turned to go.\n\n“No, no.” One of them was waving me back. “You talking about a really big motherfucker?” The man raised his hand to signify. “Yay high? Black coat? Nasty scars?”\n\n“Yeah.” I nodded.\n\n“Well, that’s Tall Frank. What you wanna about him? You see him in your recycling?”\n\n“No, why?”\n\n“Tall Frank’s a can man. He makes his living that way.”\n\nI nodded. “He was acting weird in my backyard last night.”\n\n“Weird how? Was he just looking like his weird self ?”\n\n“No. He was staring at me from outside. When I went out he tried to say something. Or mouth something.”\n\nBoth of their brows rose. “You saying that Tall Frank tried to communicate with you?”\n\n“Yeah.” \n\nThey both looked at each other. “Tall Frank talks to nobody. And by talks I mean… communicating in any kinda way.”\n\n“He cut his own throat to never talk again.” The other chimed in. \n\n“That’s just a rumor. Tall Frank showed up in this neighborhood twenty years ago. No one knows where he came from and the man can’t tell ya. Yeah, people put all kinds of legend to those scars. Some say it was dog that bit him. But I never seen no dog that’ll slice your tongue out.”\n\n“If he doesn’t communicate with anyone how come he has the name Tall Frank?”\n\n“Hmm. Well that’s what my mama would call him.” He leaned closer to me. “She used to tell me to watch my tongue or Tall Frank’ll take it!” He chuckled to himself.\n\n“What do you think he wanted with me?”\n\nThey both shrugged. “No clue. But you be sure to tell us when you find out.” \n\nThey bent back to their work and I thanked them and went on far less assured than when I’d first set out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next several days there was no sign of Tall Frank, but I began to fall ill. It was a headache at first, but soon I had heart palpitations and body aches that I almost let take me to the emergency room. \n\nI assured myself that there was no such thing as curses. Why was I letting one strange encounter with a homeless man dominate my every thought? Angie was working late recently and when I had the house to myself at night, I would stand at the kitchen window and stare into the backyard. \n\nI was obsessed and it wasn’t long before I saw him again. I was wrapped in a blanket filling the teapot at the sink when I saw him standing in the same place as before.\n\nI dropped the pot and ran to the back door. \n\n“Hey!” My head felt light and I was in that same kind of drunken state where your fear hardly speaks to you. I scampered through the backyard over to him. “What do you want with me?”\n\nTall Frank was staring at me. He gestured with his scarred neck for me to follow. \n\nI looked down at my bare feet, but he was already walking. \n\n“Hey! Just leave us alone!” \n\nI stepped cautiously after him. When I got past the bushes where I could see the alley I saw him standing near the trashcans.\n\nI ran after him. “You! I don’t ever want to see you back here again!” With our difference in size and the blanket wrapped around my shoulders I’m sure I looked to him like some angry hobbit. \n\nHe certainly didn’t act intimated and I can’t blame him. Tall Frank crossed the alley and sat on a crumbling retaining wall. He gently tapped the stone next to him for me to sit. \n\n“I’m not fucking sitting.”\n\nHe reached into his breast pocket and paused before pulling out an envelope. Then he put the letter in his other hand and reached in again and pulled out another. \n\n“What are those?”\n\nHe extended the envelopes to me, his long arm nearly stretched the entire alley. I approached the letters cautiously snatching them and stepping back. \n\n“What are these?” I muttered already distracted. They had both been opened and I took the papers out of one of the envelopes.\n\nIt was a handwritten letter on college ruled paper. All the ink was smeared like it’d been dunked in water, but I could still read it albeit slowly. When I was done reading, I let my arm fall down to my side and stared at Tall Frank in disbelief. \n\nAngie had a lover. \n\nI looked at the other envelope and hardly had to read it to figure it out.\n\nThe letterhead read: Atlantic Life Insurance. \n\nA policy had been opened in my name for a quarter of a million dollars. \n\nI stumbled over to the retaining wall and sat. \n\n“The pills.” I thought about the empty capsule he’d shown me that I tossed aside. It was my emergency Albuterol. It had to be. A quick WebMD search showed that an overdose started with symptoms of headaches and heart palpations. \n\n“Angie is trying to kill me?”\n\nSuddenly I realized Tall Frank’s arm was around me and he was patting my shoulder paternally. \n\nWe sat there in silence for a long time. \n\n“The things you can learn from people’s recycling.” I said.\n\nTall Frank nodded and we watched the upstairs light turn on and my wife appeared in the window. She twisted something in her fingers and then tapped it into a mug.\n\nA minute later I heard the back door open. \n\n“Honey are you out here?” Angie called. “I made you some tea!”\n\nI guess the homeless around her don’t always want change.

We see a lot of strange and disgusting things, but what I saw last week has me questioning both my job and reality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlhqu6\/ive_been_a_search_and_rescue_diver_for_12_years\/","flair":"Series","author":"travisliebert","selftext":"I’ve been involved with water search and rescue for twelve years now. I’ve seen a lot of upsetting and even unexplainable things in my time, but those pale in comparison to what I saw recently. Water search and rescue is often a depressing job. When someone gets lost in a forest, they can still be found alive days later. But when we get a call, it’s almost always body recovery. People don’t last long in the water.\n\nI can’t tell you exactly where, but I live in a northern territory known for its water sports. Fishing, kayaking, diving - whatever it is, our waters probably have a solid reputation for it. Despite that, this area isn’t some kind of resort. The waters here are cold and oftentimes vicious. Search and rescue operations here can be grueling and not many stick with it. There are a few older guys who have been doing it longer than me, but I’m one of the most experienced around.\n\nLike I said before, this job is more body recovery than anything, especially here. We save more live moose from the water than live humans. And when we get a call about a missing child…well we’d be better off just giving our condolences. That’s just how the waters are here. Our small town has one of the highest drowning rates in the country. But we look anyway, and usually we find a body.\n\nI’ve considered quitting many times in my career. Most people quit after their first recovery. In training, we try to emphasize just how much water can distort a corpse, but nothing can prepare you for the harsh reality. It’s not uncommon for us to find bodies bloated beyond recognition. Sometimes they barely even seem human. A lot of divers don’t last long after seeing something like that. But I continued to do it after all these years. I figured if I didn’t then no one would.\n\nHowever, the things I saw last week have made me reconsider that decision.\n\nI got the call around 11 A.M. A father had taken his ten-year-old son fly fishing. At one point, the father managed to stab a hook all the way through his finger. He went back up to his truck to get a first-aid kit. The boy was gone when he returned a few minutes later.\n\nWhen I first heard the story, I hung my head in silence for a moment. It had been raining heavily for almost a month now, and the waters were running faster than ever. To make things worse, it was unusually cold for the season. A number of people had gone missing in recent weeks. Many of them had yet to be found. I had little hope of finding the boy alive.\n\nMe and a couple of other divers were at the site where the boy went missing within an hour, and a larger search and rescue team located a few towns over was headed our way. We talked with the father and even searched the forest for a bit, hoping that he had just wandered off. But eventually we realized that we would have to begin searching in the river.\n\nThe moment I got in the water I knew the boy was gone. The current was worse than it had ever been, and even I had difficulty navigating the icy river. We looked for hours in the surrounding areas, and even expanded our search once the larger team had arrived. The boy was nowhere to be found.\n\nI was surprised. I hadn’t expected to find him alive, but I had at least anticipated finding a body. However, there was no trace of him. The sun got low and the air grew colder. We were considering calling it off as nightfall approached and resuming the search the next day when I discovered something.\n\nThere’s a lot of creek beds around the river. Many of them have dried up as a result of encroaching vegetation or manmade efforts to divert the water. We usually don’t pay any attention to them. However, with all of the recent rain, I noticed that one of the larger creek beds had begun flowing again. A surprising amount of water crashed through it, easily enough to carry a young boy.\n\nThe creek ran directly across a bend in the river, connecting it at two points. I followed it and realized that the boy could be located outside of our initial search area. As I approached where the creek reconnected with the main river, I felt a sinking feeling in my gut.\n\nThere’s a place in the river where not even search and rescue divers are supposed to go. It’s known as Badwater. This area lies on one half of the river and runs for about 100 yards. It’s near a densely vegetated area, so we don’t often have to worry about people swimming there. But a lot of disappearances occur in the surrounding waters. Despite that, I’ve been warned not to dive there since I began doing search and rescue. Supposedly the undercurrent is so strong that even the most experienced swimmer would be swept away in an instant. “Don’t go near Badwater.” It was a mantra of the older divers.\n\nThe creek ended exactly in the center of the Badwater region. As I reached it, I stopped and chewed my lip thoughtfully. If I went back and reported this to the other divers, they would tell me to let it go. They wouldn’t let me dive there. But deep down I felt like the boy’s body must be tangled up in some weeds nearby. If only I could find it. I hated the idea of that kid being stuck down there, slowly bloating and rotting away while his parents sat at home wondering where their boy had gone.\n\nBadwater didn’t seem to be that bad. I’d seen rougher waters before, but I knew looks could be deceiving. Just below the surface it could be flowing faster than I ever imagined. And I’d be swept away in an instant. Besides, I wasn’t supposed to dive alone. I almost turned back, but something made me stay. I stared into the river for a moment, thinking about the boy. Then I put on my gear and dropped into the icy waters.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the current actually seemed pretty weak. As a matter of fact, it was weaker than the rest of the river. The water was extremely deep there, and I could see only blackness below as I dove. I kicked deeper and deeper, thinking that the current might pick up lower down, but the opposite seemed to be true. The water was almost completely still.\n\nI went even deeper until finally green shapes began to materialize in front of me. I thought I’d finally reached a bed of weeds. But, as I kicked lower, the truth came into full view. I felt vomit come up at the sight, an odd and dangerous sensation when you’re wearing a scuba mask.\n\nCountless arms stuck up from the ground below. I thought I had come upon a trove of bodies, but the disgusting reality became even more apparent only a moment later. The arms grew directly into the ground. They even had roots that spread out from the base. It was as if someone had cut off hundreds of arms at the shoulder and planted them there. They were green, and I watched as they clutched at the water around them. They varied in size and seemingly age. Grotesque baby hands sprouted near the bottom, and they opened and closed their fists hungrily.\n\nIt was then that I saw the boy. His eyes stared sightlessly ahead as those grotesque arms pulled his dead body downward. It seemed they had just gotten ahold of him. The arms yanked at him, burying him in the surrounding sediment. They pushed and writhed and squirmed until he was securely buried up to the chest. I stared in mesmerized horror.\n\nThat was when the other bodies came into focus. There must have been at least four more, all in varying stages of decay. Some were bloated beyond recognition, only bulky, white masses that protruded loosely from the riverbed. I once again felt vomit rising in my throat and swallowed it back down. The fucking hands were feeding off the bodies, using them as fertilizer.\n\nThe moment I clambered out of the water I tore my mask off and retched. I couldn’t stop thinking about those disgusting bodies, those grasping hands. They were like some sort of carnivorous plant, yet they were so humanoid. I vomited again at the thought.\n\nI frantically ran back to our base camp and pulled one of the other divers aside. Moose was the most experienced person on our team. He’d been diving for over twenty years ever since moving here. I told him about what I saw. When I  finished, he stared at me in cold silence.\n\n“I told you never to go near Badwater.” His voice contained an iciness that even his thick Louisiana accent couldn’t conceal.\n\n“That’s what you’re concerned about?” I was incredulous.\n\nHe placed a hand on my shoulder and squeezed tightly. “Don’t tell anyone else about this. If the others find out you went into Badwater…” He trailed off and thought for a moment. “Well, it won’t be good.” He shook his head like a disappointed father.\n\n“But what about those things?” I tried to keep my voice down, hoping no one would hear us. “How many people have died because of those fucking things?”\n\n“Shut up.” Moose said. “We have an agreement. There’s a reason they only grow in Badwater. Don’t fuck this up.”\n\nI started to say something, but the words caught in my throat. He was keeping something from me.\n\nHe sighed and I saw something like sadness behind his eyes. “Sometimes you have to decide between lesser and greater evils. Even the best possible decisions can still keep you up at night.” He went silent for a moment and only stared at me. “Don’t tell anyone about this. Maybe one day you’ll understand.”\n\nHe walked away after that and called off the day’s search. Despite what I’d told him, we continued to search for the next two days. By the third day we called it off completely and gave our condolences to the family.\n\nI don’t know what the fuck is happening. Moose has been acting different towards me ever since. There’s an iciness to him, but every now and then he’ll shoot me a knowing glance, like we’re in on some secret together. I’ve noticed the other older divers acting strangely too. What did he mean by agreement? What the fuck were those arm things? I’m considering quitting and moving away from here. I can’t live with the knowledge that those things are down there, slowly feeding off the body of a young boy among countless [others](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/travisliebert).\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmg9c8\/ive_been_a_search_and_rescue_diver_for_12_years\/)"},"281":{"title":"I died for six minutes in 2003.

It happened on an ordinary afternoon, at the point in my daily routine when I walked home from the bus stop. In the four blocks between the corner where I hopped off the bus and my front door, I started to feel nauseous.\n\nIt came on suddenly, without warning. I’d felt just fine all day, ate a lunch of bosco sticks and marinara sauce, something I’d eaten hundreds of times throughout high school. Before I had an opportunity to consider alternative causes, I broke out in a cold sweat.\n\nThen I felt the curious flutter in my chest.\n\nMy heart slipped into what I later learned was an episode of ventricular fibrillation.\n\nI became breathless and collapsed. What happened next has been told to me after the fact. I apparently sprawled in the road, where a woman driving a hatchback nearly crushed my skull beneath her tires. Instead, she screeched to a halt, tried to rouse me, then dialled emergency services when she failed to do so.\n\nEMS arrived to discover my heart had stopped beating. I was dead, technically. They transported my body to the hospital, and somewhere along the way managed to shock my ticker back to life. Thus began a harrowing weeks-long journey through the American healthcare system that led eventually to an ablation, pacemaker, and mountains of debt my family’s still dealing with.\n\nBut my heart’s alright.\n\nAnd thank f\\*\\*k it is, because what I learned that day has taught me never to thank God for anything.\n\nBecause for those six minutes, as my lifeless body traveled across the city accompanied by two paramedics working tirelessly to revive me, my soul transcended our world to visit the hereafter. During my visit, I learned things about our universe that I wish I hadn’t. Perhaps in sharing my story, I might help our species prepare for what comes after we expire.\n\nIt began with light. Blinding, white, pervasive. It bathed me, calmed me. It was everything they tell you about. Beatific, welcoming, the stuff of spiritual experiences.\n\nI had the distinct feeling of ascent, like the light was lifting me skyward. I passed through several sets of gates, which my dizzied consciousness hardly registered. Upon reflection, I don’t believe they were physical in any sense, and yet I recall the feeling of admittance, as if they might’ve prevented me from rising had they remained closed.\n\nIn any event, I arrived in a place without dimension, a place beyond reality. It only made sense while I occupied it. I don’t believe a corporeal being can make sense of the astral plane, something about its intangible existence defies translation.\n\nSo what I came away with were more impressions than images. I was not alone. Several life forces enclosed me upon my arrival. At first, because of my Christian upbringing, I believed them to be angels. In my incorporeal form, I made the spiritually-equivalent gesture of opening my arms, anticipating their embrace.\n\nInstead, I felt myself shackled by their powers, like a collared dog. Humiliation and terror came over me. These were not the ethereal beings I’d been led to believe await us. These were cruel, unsympathetic overlords by whom I was fettered.\n\nWhy? I thought, my soul wailing like a petulant child.\n\nSomething like laughter returned, but it was cold, mocking. Thoughts floated into my consciousness like birds winging in and out of sight. They delivered some horrifying truths about existence that I’ll do my best to relay to you now:\n\nOur universe, like many others running parallel to it, contains a pittance of the total energy in existence. It is a farm, used to produce souls, which only arise in the precise conditions found in our cosmos. When you hear scientists talk about the improbability of the existence of our goldilocks universe, it’s because they don’t actually come into being spontaneously.\n\nThey’re designed. And the hands that craft them are not benevolent gods, but rapacious beings with little care for the creatures they create.\n\nOur ultimate purpose, I learned in the custody of the spirits that shackled me, was to ripen until we were ready to serve them on their higher plane.\n\nThe Big Bang gave birth to the universe to give rise to life to eventuate in humanity, a sufficiently conscious organism that may be harvested for use as slaves on a higher plane, where time and space dissolve into an eternity we spend in servitude.\n\nSix minutes in “heaven” felt like a lifetime, which I spent amusing what I perceived to be a childlike spirit with a penchant for psychologically distressing manipulation. It batted me around like a cat with a caught mouse, reveling in the pain it produced. Physical discomforts we imagine hell inflicting upon us pale in comparison to the torture of soul pain. Loss of a loved one comes closest, that piercing, emotional damage resulting from trauma.\n\nWhen it became clear my time had not yet expired on Earth and I was to return, I was told not to reveal their existence to the rest of my kind. My reward, they communicated to me, would be a marginally improved station among the slave population. Alternatively, if I managed to convince others of their existence, new horrors would await me when I returned.\n\nI can’t imagine anything worse than what I experienced, subsumed beneath an ineffable grief and torment.\n\nFor weeks, I tried to explain to anyone who would listen what I experienced. Everyone told me I’d suffered a very serious and traumatic experience for a young man, that the event left scars on my psyche as well as my heart.\n\nI gave up trying to convince them.\n\nI slowly began to convince myself that what they’d told me was true. I’d simply imagined it. A death dream, as it were. The mind reckoning with its own imminent demise, trying to make sense of the experience.\n\nThen I met someone who claimed to have met God.\n\nThis was a few years later, when the author of a nonfiction book recounting their near death experience visited my hometown. (I won’t reveal the author’s name as I don’t want to invite a lawsuit, which I’m sure he’d launch against me if he read that I’d besmirched him.) I attended a reading and afterward confronted him about his tale. \n\nI looked him in the eye and asked if he really met God – something I’m sure he’s dealt with hundreds of times. He smiled and nodded, assuring me that yes, God is real and is filled with love. On a lark, I decided to tell him that I knew the truth, that slavery awaits us all.\n\nA flicker in his gaze betrayed his knowledge of the fact. He really had died and visited the afterlife, but lied about it in his book.\n\nBecause he knew.\n\nHe knew the truth of heaven, the horrible place our souls are bound [for](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JulianVoss\/)."},"282":{"title":"A Talking Crow Taught me to Fly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8qs8jv\/a_talking_crow_taught_me_to_fly\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I used to look out the rusted iron bars of my window and dream about being a bird.\n\nThe chain that shackled me to my bed was just long enough to reach the windowsill, and so every night after my father would visit my room I would lie awake and wait for the first rays of light to creep over the horizon, then walk over to my window to listen to the morning’s first few notes of birdsong.\n\nTheir melodies were so beautiful, I knew that they must have been singing about places far away and wonderful, about sailing on the wind through endless blue skies, looking down at the treetops that dotted the land below.\n\nThen, one morning as I lay in bed, something impossible happened. I had fallen asleep the night before, and would have missed my morning birdsong but for a tapping on my window. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to see a crow sitting outside on the sill, tapping my window with his beak.\n\nI crept over to the window and smiled at the bird.\n\n“Hello, Mr. Crow,” I said.\n\n“Hello little girl,” said the crow.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded for a moment, not knowing what to say. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I forced myself to speak.\n\n“You know how to talk?” I said.\n\n“All birds know how to talk,” he replied. “It’s just that not all humans know how to listen.”\n\nI pushed my window open a crack until it hit against the bars. The bird cocked its head in curiosity.\n\n“Why are you in a cage?” it asked.\n\n“I think it’s my destiny,” I said. “It’s always been this way.”\n\n“You look rather thin,” replied the crow. “Would you like something to eat?”\n\nMy stomach gave a weak growl.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “That would be wonderful.”\n\nWithout another word the crow took flight. A few minutes later he returned with a small branch of figs. The crow watched me as I greedily devoured the fruit. After I had finished he stared at me for a moment before speaking again.\n\n“I didn’t know they put people in cages,” he said. “Do you think they mistook you for a bird?”\n\n“I don’t think so Mr. Crow,” I said.\n\nWe whiled away the rest of that day talking. The crow told me all about what it was like to fly, how there was no better feeling in the world. He told me about the far away lands he had visited when he was a young bird and could still make the journey north with the changing of the seasons. Finally, evening came and the crow said that he had to go. The next morning he was back, however, with two more branches of figs.\n\nI thanked him for his generosity, and we talked another day away. That day he even sang me a song. He didn’t have a voice for singing, but I thought his song was beautiful anyway.\n\nWe passed the entire fall that way, and the bird’s visits became the only bright spot in my life. He brought me not only figs, but cherries and walnuts too\\-\\-anything small enough for him to carry.\n\nSoon, however, winter came, and with it the frosts that destroyed the figs and cherries that the crow had used to bring me. His gifts became fewer and fewer, and I could tell from his tired voice that he was flying farther and farther away to get them.\n\nOne morning, when the first snows of winter had fallen, the crow asked me a question.\n\n“What would you do to leave this place?” he asked, cocking his head to the side.\n\nI thought for a moment, but I wasn’t sure how to answer. Finally, I told the truth.\n\n“I would do anything to leave this place,” I said. “Anything at all.”\n\nThe crow solemnly nodded and said, “The frost isn’t the only thing that winter brings.”\n\nHe flapped his wings once and jumped from the windowsill, and I didn’t see him for three days. I began to fall into a deep depression. Every morning I would still listen to the birdsong, but it sounded forlorn and empty without my friend there to listen with me.\n\nThe morning after the third day my crow friend returned. It was so beautiful that day; the sun had come out from behind the clouds to melt the snow\\-\\-one of the last green days before winter came in earnest. As the shadow passed over the valley in which we lived, I first mistook it for a storm cloud, but then I heard the sound. It was loud enough to crack the sky, but it wasn’t thunder\\-\\-it was birds.\n\nThousands upon thousands of them descended on our house. A whirling storm of beating wings and shrieking caws, they crashed into the walls and windows, pecking at them with wild ferocity. The house shook under their assault, and their calls were so loud that I didn’t even hear the windows breaking.\n\nThey were not so loud, however, that I could not hear my father scream. It was over in a matter of minutes, and the key to my shackles slipped under the door. I rushed over and picked it up with trembling hands, sliding it into the metal cuff around my ankle and turning it.\n\nThe cuff came loose with a heavy click, and for the first time I was free.\n\nThe key to the door slipped under the jamb as well, and I opened the door to the rest of the house. The place had been all but destroyed. There was splintered wood and broken glass everywhere, and in the center of the living room was what remained of my father\\-\\-a pile of bloodstained feathers.\n\nThe birds had all flown off, but Mr. Crow sat on top of the living room fireplace, regarding me with a curious look.\n\n“Now you can fly free, little girl,” he said. “No more cages for you.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Crow,” I said. “Will you come with me?”\n\nMr. Crow shook his head.\n\n“I am an old bird,” he said. “And my journey is coming to a close. But yours is just beginning.”\n\nMr. Crow flapped his wings and took flight, and I never saw him again. As I stepped out of the front door my bare feet touched the grass for the very first time, and I could smell the flowers on the breeze as it drifted over me.\n\nAt that moment, though my feet were firmly on the ground, my heart was soaring through endless blue sky, far above the world that I had left behind.\n\nI still wake up every morning to hear the birds sing, and when the first few notes break the silence of the early dawn, I think of Mr. Crow and smile.\n\n[x](http:\/\/facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"283":{"title":"I’m a Firewatcher. I found another Firewatcher’s unsettling journal at my new station.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/adt7vs\/im_a_firewatcher_i_found_another_firewatchers\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"**I am a firewatcher. Upon moving in to my station, I found the following pages typed on my desk. I am not the author of the following. I am transcribing exactly what I found, dated 1989:**\n\n---------------\n\n----\n\nI’ve been located here for 185 days, according to my calendar. I’m stationed up in the northwest of the United States with two other guys—Clark and Thomas. \n\n185 days. That’s five days longer than our stint here should’ve been. Normally, they rotate us out every 180 days. We were supposed to be picked up by Helicopter 5 days ago.\n\nI started writing this logbook, journal, whatever, because we’re overdue for evac. Or so we think. Maybe we messed up the calendar somehow.\n\nOur main radio stopped working on day 179.\n\n“Get up! There’s smoke.”\n\nBleary-eyed, I saw Clark standing over my bunk. I could see the orange slits of light reflecting on his torso, signaling to me it was the early morning.\n\n“Teddy! Smoke!”\n\n“Smoke? Huh?” I said, still half-delirious.\n\n“Yes, smoke. A really small stream of it maybe a mile southeast.” His eyes were wide and brighter than the sunlight on his uniform.\n\nI pulled myself out of the bottom bunk and headed towards the window. I didn’t even need my binoculars to see the small sliver of smoke creating a shadow in the early sun’s light. In 185 days, it’s only the second time we’ve seen a potential fire.\n\nFor those who don’t know what a fire watchtower looks like, it’s basically a wooden cabin elevated about 100 feet in the air. Ours has a staircase that wraps around the structure beneath the cabin. I’m pretty sure other towers use ladders, but that’s beside the point.\n\nClark and I bunk up in the watch tower. We have a little kitchen, our bunk bed, and a 360-degree view of nothing but woods. Thomas sleeps in a tiny little cabin at the base of our tower, which is also where our main office is. ‘Office’ may be too loose of a term. It’s one desk and a typewriter used for typing out reports of what we see out here.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked over to Clark, “alright, let’s go check it out.”\n\n“No way, Teddy. No way,” he replied immediately.\n\nClark has been afraid to go past the outhouse since day 180 passed. He’s afraid a helicopter will come, and he’ll miss his chance to be rescued.\n\n‘Rescued’ Clark would say. But are we in danger? Did we miscalculate the number of days we’ve been out here? We still have plenty of food. Did they forget about us? Has the apocalypse come and gone and we don’t know because we’ve been isolated?\n\n“Okay, fine,” I agreed, “Radio down to Thomas and let him know. He should be up.”\n\nOur main radio back to base isn’t getting a sign of life from anywhere. And if it isn’t receiving from anywhere, we assume we aren’t being heard from anywhere. Luckily, we still have our own walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.\n\nClark took out his walkie.\n\n“Tom, there’s some smoke about a mile southeast. Can you go check it out?”\n\nA few seconds passed before Thomas responded.\n\n“After I finish wiping my ass I’ll be on my way. Unless you wanna help me with that Clarky.”\n\nThomas, the oldest of us, is always picking on Clark, the youngest. He doesn’t really dislike Clark. He is just easy to pick on. He’s a twenty-three-year-old college dropout. I think he studied accounting or finance or something on his parents’ dime. I don’t think he left college to be a professional firewatcher. No, I think he left to come out in the wilderness, be alone, and take a retrospective look at his life to decide what he really wants.\n\nYou only sign up for 180 days of isolation if you’re crazy, or if you want to get away from something. I’m not sure which category Thomas falls is. He’s a cryptic, brute of a man. His picture is probably in the dictionary next to “lumberjack.” He’s pretty quiet unless he has a joke to tell or something important to say. Either way, when he opens his mouth, I listen.\n\nAs for me, it’s not important why I’m out here.\n\n“Headed out now,” Thomas radioed. \n\nClark and I watched Thomas start his trek into the tree line until we could no longer see him.\n\nClark cocked his head towards mine.\n\n“Teddy,” he said to me, “Thomas has been acting... different. Weird.”\n\nI didn’t expect him to be so blunt. But I had noticed. I knew Clark had noticed, but this was the first time we spoke about it.\n\n“I know.”\n\n“He doesn’t seem to be bothered that we are stuck out here.”\n\n“We don’t *know* if we are stuck out here. We could’ve scratched off the dates wrong. You know—we thought we didn’t scratch the day off yet but we really did, so we accidentally scratch the next day too.”\n\n“I guess,” Clark said softly. I knew what he was going to say next.\n\n“At night though—”\n\n“Shut it, Clark.”\n\n“C’mon Teddy! It’s fucked up. He’s fine during the day and then just, just changes. Does he have some type’a illness? It happened so sudden!”\n\n“Maybe he does! So what if the guy goes out at night to stare at trees?”\n\n“Trees? Stare at trees?”\n\n“I know you’ve seen it. He goes out near the tree line and stands there for a while looking out. Sometimes hours. Maybe he does have a screw loose, and maybe he shouldn’t be out here. But I don’t think it’s the best idea to bring it up to him when we are trapped here with him, especially if he *is* insane.”\n\nSilence fell between us before Clark responded.\n\n“I didn’t know he stares out at the forest,” he said to me in a soft voice and eyes wider than when he woke me up this morning.\n\n“Oh—wait, what? What were you going to say?”\n\n“At—At night,” he stammered, “he comes up the stairs.”\n\nI looked over to our half-open door leading out to the staircase, letting a cool breeze in.\n\n“Wh—what do you—what?”\n\n“He comes up the stairs, and, and just, looks at us. Stares at us.”\n\n------------\n\nThomas left to go check out the smoke about an hour ago. It seems to have vanished, so I figure he handled it. \n\nClark spends his days using our walkie talkies, trying every station possible to alert anyone nearby.\n\nI just watch the forest.\n\n---------------\n\nIt’s 11:30 PM. Thomas isn’t back. He left at about 7 AM. He hasn’t answered his radio.\n\nTomorrow will be day 186. We do not know if Thomas is okay, and one of us will most likely have to check the woods tomorrow—and since Clark is chicken-shit, it'll end up being me.\n\nMore disturbing though, is something Clark told me a few minutes ago—the reason I went back to the office to type this.\n\nI was leaned back in my swivel chair, spinning slowly, making sure there were no lights or fires in the dark expanse of trees, and wondering where Thomas was. He must’ve been hurt. Even if he was lost, he’d reply on his walkie. We always answer our walkies. They’re with us at all times, even when we are shitting or showering.\n\nClark stopped my chair mid-spin and mid-thought. Before I could protest, he spoke.\n\n“Listen. I need to tell you something I’ve been thinking about recently. It’s eating away at me.”\n\nI wondered if it had to do with Thomas.\n\n“Okay,” I said. “I’m all ears.”\n\n“It’s going to sound crazy,” he warned.\n\n“I bet I’ve heard crazier.”\n\nHe took a long, yet stuttered inhale, then spoke. “I don’t remember coming out here.”\n\nMy facial expression didn’t change, and it looked like he was waiting for a reaction, so he repeated.\n\n“I don’t remember coming out here. Do you? Do you remember applying for this job? Do you remember being interviewed? Or being flown out here?”\n\nAt first, I was almost amused. \n\nThen as he asked those questions, I froze.\n\nI didn’t remember.\n\nHe continued, “You know how I said I decided to leave college? Well, now that I’m thinking about it harder, I don’t know if I did. I mean I must have, right? To be out here? I must have. But all I can remember is my last day of class for the semester, and then I was here. I don’t remember anything between coming home after class and meeting you and Thomas.”\n\nI was listening, but it probably didn’t show. I was still motionless.\n\nI couldn’t remember. I tried and am still trying.\n\nThomas is missing.\n\nClark and I are losing our minds or—or something else.\n\nEither way, I can’t explain it yet.\n\n-----\n\n----------\n\n**There are more pages scattered about, but I haven’t figured out the order.

As the years have gone by and I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can’t shake the feeling that it is.\n\nIt happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only.\n\n“This human is creeping me out,” he said. “It almost looks like it’s looking right at me.”\n\n“I am looking right at you,” I said.\n\nThe demon nearly jumped out of his skin. “You can see me?” he asked.\n\n“Yes. Can’t everybody?”\n\n“Not unless they’re in the fifth dimension.”\n\n“Am I in the fifth dimension?” I asked.\n\n“Your mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?”\n\nI thought for a moment, and then grinned.\n\n“Trains.”\n\n“Oh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you’re going crazy.”\n\n“I hope I’m not going crazy,” I said.\n\n“Being crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,” the demon replied.\n\nI laughed.\n\n“Do you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?” I asked.\n\n“Of course,” he said. “How else would we get to work?”\n\n”You’ve got wings!” I said.\n\n“Yes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I’m all sweaty when I get there.”\n\n“So what do you use your wings for?” I asked.\n\n“I put them over my head when it rains.”\n\n“Can I see?” I asked.\n\n“Sure,” the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head.\n\nI laughed again.\n\n“You’re funny,” I said.\n\nThe demon laughed too, but then his expression changed.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked. “You seem sad.”\n\n“Yes, yes.” the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. “Say, would you like to see a magic trick?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nThe demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out.\n\n“That’s funny.” I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn’t holding my dad’s hand anymore.\n\nI looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains.\n\n“I can’t see the subway station anymore,” I said.\n\n“That’s okay,” said the demon. “Sometimes it’s better to see what isn’t there instead of what is.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Sometimes when I’m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.”\n\n“That’s funny,” I laughed. “Can you go to other dimensions, too?”\n\nBut the demon didn’t answer, he was looking up at the sky.\n\n“It’s starting to rain,” he said, whooshing his wings up over his head.\n\nWarm droplets of rain hit my face. \n\n“Can I get under your wings with you?” I asked.\n\n“Not now,” he replied. “You’ve got to go home.”\n\nThe world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn’t see my dad.\n\n“Where’s dad?” I asked her. “Did he bring me home?”\n\n“Yes, darling,” she said, although she didn’t look at me when she said it. “He brought you home and then he had to go away.”\n\n“Oh,” I replied. “When will he be back?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said.\n\nMy dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train.\n\nHe said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater’s snout.\n\n[x](http:\/\/Facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"285":{"title":"I work at NASA.

We didn't beam out an episode of The Office towards Andromeda and hear back from alien critics. And we definitely didn't meet them face to face. We found another way to communicate. Something, apparently ancient humans had figured out as well.\n\nThere are countless dilapidated ancient structures around the world, and some of them, not all, but some, were communication arrays. At least a handful on each continent. I'm sure you'll be able to think of a few after I describe what we did.\n\nWe've been working on this technology for a while. There has been a long standing theory that sound has a much larger part in the universe than just being random vibrations. That the universe is simply a bunch of vibrations and sound, and if you find a way to manipulate those vibrations properly, you could do things that seem impossible. We proved that yesterday. \n\nBy creating an extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY, precise echo chamber, and playing certain frequencies into it, at precisely the right volumes, and the exact right timings, we broke some sort of barrier.\n\nNothing really happened, visually at least. We had run countless tests like these with tiny, minute differences, and this one seemed pretty mundane. There was a slight unnatural thrumming, the glass between us and the echo chamber shook in regular intervals as if we were playing a bass heavy song too loudly. The first thing that tipped us off that something was happening was that once we turned the speakers off, the thrumming didn't stop. My three coworkers and I could all feel this thrumming in out chests still, kind of like being next to a very loud drum. We talked for a moment, before we all fell silent.\n\nThere was something else now. It wasn't a voice. It was, some sort of, intellegent vibration. I can't explain it. It was like a voice was inside my chest, but it wasn't speaking, I could just feel what it was saying. My cohorts and I debated on the exact wording afterwards, but we all agreed on the overall messages each time. \n\nLike I said, they weren't really talking, so I'll do my best to phrase it in ways that get across what they said, in the way they \"said\" it. \n\n\"Wooooaaaahhh, you guys are back?\" Is what I felt in my chest. My colleagues and I stared at each other in utter confusion. One of the spoke up. \"Hello?\" He asked hesitantly. There was a silence for a moment, before the thrumming spoke back. \"I think I have it set right now, say that again?\"\n\n\"Hello?\" I repeated back to it in place of the other scientist. \n\n\"Yep, there it is.\" He said quickly. \"You guys figured it out again! That's crazy!\" It exclaimed. This wasn't what I was thinking the first human\/alien conversation was going to go. I wasn't even sure that this was first contact at this point though. \"Who is this? What is this?\" I asked loudly into the open air of our control room.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give you details like who we are, but, what this is, is the ultimate form of communication in our universe. Your ancestors figured it out briefly too.\" With some quick deduction on how it was wording things, I think each of us figured out what we were talking to was alien in origin around the same time.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I asked. \"You have to be close.\" Hell, with the way we were talking back and forth, they had to be REALLY close. It takes communications to Mars a few minutes to get there, just because that's as fast as light is. If we were talking this quickly back and forth they basically had to be on Earth.\n\n\"I guess you wouldn't know. We didn't tell your ancestors. We didn't think they'd get it. Let me do some math real quick.\" It was about a minute before it spoke again. \"What you see as your observable universe, thats not the whole universe. Not even close. Multiply that by about 15, and thats about how far we are away. And theres a lot past that.\" \n\nWe all looked at each other. It was speaking utter bullshit to us now. That was impossible, we'd never be able to communicate, ever. Physically impossible. We explained that to the chest-voice, and we were met by an equal level of confusion. \"Why are you still using light as a yardstick?\" It asked incredulously. Suddenly, its voice grew slightly dire. \"You're still not advanced enough. You don't even know.\" \n\n\"Know what?\" One of my friends asked.\n\n\"You are dead center in the Life Abyss. There is no life on any planet around you, for more than ten of your observable universes around you in any direction. Its a universal mystery how you're even alive.\" It spoke grimly. Never in my life had I felt smaller, more insignificant and more alone.

Eight years and a fistful of premature gray hairs later, I’m just a few hundred thousand dollars poorer than “broke.” That would matter if I had a family to provide for, but the long hours in med school have led to an end of my last relationship and a countdown on the shelf life of my ovaries. \n\nI was in a “take what I can get and be grateful” situation. \n\nSo when St. Francis Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia offered me a position, I packed my sad life into three bags and sought opportunity in the hills of Appalachia. Nineteen of us started in July, and thirteen have since dropped out. \n\nI like to think of myself as the rat that wouldn’t drown.\n\nSome people broke inside after watching children die because they weren’t good enough doctors quite yet (everyone has to be a rookie at some point). It’s doubly hard when you have to inform the dead child’s parents, who then beg you to tell them different news, or scream that they want to die and just please kill them with whatever drug takes away the pain.\n\nBut most of my incoming class couldn’t handle the chief of medicine. \n\nDr. Vivian Scritt is, without a doubt, the biggest bitch I’ve ever met. \n\nNow I know why.\n\n“Nineteen of you start today, and we’ve got a pool going with bets on how long each of you will last,” she told us on Day One. “Don’t feel any pressure, folks. I’ve talked with each of you in private, and my expectations are very low.” \n\nShe peered condescendingly over her thin spectacles, snorted, then turned around to walk away. \n\n“You should know when to follow me and when to stay away, because I’m not going to waste time explaining what you should figure out on your own.”\n\nWe gawked at one another, all feeling weak and small, then scampered after her. \n\nI was last in line, and felt out of place taking even that much.   \n \n“You should have the list of expectations for St. Francis,” Dr. Scritt explained as she walked on, not bothering to look at us as she talked. “I printed eighteen sets of rules so that you would have to challenge one another for them, knowing that one of you would be left behind.”\n\nAn icy cold settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw everyone look down at a list of rules that only I did not have. \n\n“If you cannot follow these rules, there will be no place for you in this hospital. It most likely means that you are unsuited to be a doctor, and should consider a profession that demands a weaker mental aptitude.” At that, she turned around to face us all. “And if you think that I’m the type to give second chances after a mistake, you’re woefully underprepared for the world of medicine.” She stopped and looked at each of us in turn, apparently expecting a response that no one dared to offer.\n\n“Well,” she shot out in exasperation, “why are you standing here? People are dying. Get to work!”\n\n*\n\nNo one wanted to show me their list of rules, so I had to wait until one of my classmates died.\n\nIt took nearly a week. \n\nI was working at 3:00 a. m. because I had only been on the clock for ten hours. I was rushing into another room so that a patient wouldn’t know I was Googling his symptoms (doctors do this FAR more than you realize) when I saw Myron by himself in an O. R. \n\nI stopped immediately. “Myron?” I squeaked. “What the hell is that?” \n\nHis arms were working furiously, but his back was turned toward me, so I couldn’t see what he was doing.\n\nSomething felt wrong. \n\nMyron was the pick of our litter. He’d been top ten in his class at John Hopkins, and he would remind us of that fact in exchange for answering the questions that we were too terrified to ask Dr. Scritt.\n\nSlowly, I approached Myron, not wanted to startle him. “We’re really busy right now, is there something you need help with?”\n\nHe showed no outward signs that he had heard me. Instead, he kept pumping away furiously at the task at hand. \n\nWhen I was five steps from him, I could see drops of blood flying over his shoulder. \n\nWhich made no sense, since he had been alone in the room.\n\n“Myron?” I whispered, barely loudly enough to hear my own words.\n\nI slowly crept around his left side, finally bringing the scene into full view.\n\nMyron’s abdomen was split from sternum to pelvis. His esophagus spilled out, and his stomach sat on the table. A nest of quivering small intestine led from the bottom of his stomach back into his shredded torso. \n\nMyron showed no outward signs of pain.\n\nHe was too busy working.\n\nHe clutched his own stomach tightly in his left hand, the folds squirting through his fingers like unbaked bread. His right hand was working furiously with a scalpel, sawing his organ into ribbons. Rivers of sweat poured down his forehead with the intensity of the effort.\n\nI tried to scream, but it only came out as a moan.\n\nThat was enough to get Myron to notice me.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head. Slowly, he smiled.\n\nIt was not a happy smile.\n\nWith eye contact locked on me, he licked his lips, angrily stabbed a piece of his stomach, and lifted it to his mouth.\n\nHe bit.\n\nHe chewed.\n\nThen he lunged.\n\nBut most people don’t know how to move with their innards splayed out for all the world to see, and this was his downfall. Myron’s tattered guts caught on the corner of the table, and he fell to the floor. \n\nFinally, he screamed. \n\nI had learned very early in my medical career that compartmentalization is indispensible. That instinct took over my brain in the moment, and I acted clinically.\n\nMyron was still grasping his scalpel with his right hand. I kicked it – hard – and it flew out of his hands.\n\nHe stared at me and screeched.\n\nWith his entrails still wrapped around the table, I figured my best option was retreat. I moved to the back of the room as a doctor and a janitor burst in. \n\nAnd in possibly the most shocking moment of the night, I realized that they were *not* shocked. \n\nMyron was anesthetized, subdued, and extracted within a minute of their arrival. \n\nFor a moment, I was alone with a pool of blood and diced stomach lining. \n\nAnd something else.\n\nA sheet of paper lay on the floor, its corner just touching the edge of the creeping blood. \n\nMyron had dropped his list of rules. \n\nThe practical part of my brain continued to drive me. I snatched the paper from the ground, then quickly exited the room, taking care to avoid the puddle.\n\nI didn’t want to leave any bloody footprints in my wake. \n\nI knew that I had to read the list as soon as I was able to find thirty uninterrupted seconds to myself. Three hours later, I had my opportunity and ducked into a janitor’s closet. With a shaking, *exhausted* hand, I pulled the chain on a bare bulb, tried to ignore the noxious smell of leaking ammonia, and read.\n\n-------------\n\n**St. Francis Hospital Rules – Guidelines for new doctors**\n\n1 – Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else.\n\n2 – If any other doctor displays erratic behavior, leave the area immediately. Do not make eye contact.\n\n3 – If any other doctor is approached or detained by someone in a janitor’s uniform, do not interfere. Never ask about that former doctor again. \n\n4 – Never touch any seemingly abandoned Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Those are Dr. Scritt’s favorite candy.\n\n5 – Any child that dies in St. Francis hospital MUST be cremated within 120 minutes of official time of death. If you suspect this rule has been broken, alert Dr. Scritt, and the hospital will be evacuated. \n\n6 – There is no Children’s Burn Unit at St. Francis hospital. If you find yourself there, continue walking until you return to familiar territory. This usually requires traveling in a straight line down the central hallway for 47 minutes. You will not reach a wall during that interval.\n\n7 – This rule is on a need-to-know basis.\n\n8 – A small quantity of sulfuric acid is kept in every room. This is ONLY intended for use on patients with severed spinal cords. If they attack, a hypodermic injection of H2SO4 into the cranium is the only way to subdue the subject. \n\n9 – The morgue must house at least 13 cadavers at all times.\n\n10 – If find yourself on the hospital roof with no memory of how you got there, you have only two choices. Either wait for an extraction team to find you, or jump four stories to the sidewalk on Court Street.\n\n11 – If you see Room 1913, do not look directly at the numbers. Do not open the door. This is, by far, the most important rule.\n\n---------------\n\nMy heart stopped when the door opened.\n\nDr. Scritt was staring at me. What little emotion shined through her exterior seemed to be surprise.\n\nWe both stood, frozen, for five seconds of agonized silence. \n\n“Dr. Afelis,” she drawled gravely, “I’m shocked.” She stared down at the bloodstained list of rules in my hand.\n\nI reached for words. *Any* words, because literally any response would make me look less guilty than I did in that moment, staring up at my boss’s boss’s boss and saying literally nothing in my defense as she weighed my soul with her eyes.\n\nAnd I said nothing. \n\n“You took a list that wasn’t yours, and were nowhere to be found after your coworker experienced such an *unnatural* incident.” Dr. Scritt huffed through her nose. “It seems that *you’re* willing to do the unthinkable in the name of getting what you need. And *Myron* couldn’t’ even follow the most important rule.” She clenched her teeth. “I had a four-year streak of predicting which incoming doctors will break the soonest. This will *ruin* my chances in the office pool.”\n\nThe ghost of a smile graced her lips before she turned to leave. \n\n“Get to work, doctor. You’ve got three hours left on your shift, and those symptoms aren’t going to Google themselves.”\n\nI didn’t realize that I’d been holding my breath until I heard my own gasp for air.\n\nShaking, I slowly emerged from the janitor’s closet. I quickly stuffed the list of rules back into my pocket, reflecting on the fact that I had just achieved what *might* be considered an actual win.\n\nPerhaps, just maybe, I would keep my head above water at St. Francis after all. \n\nI turned to head down the hall when I stopped in my tracks. \n\nEverything was unfamiliar. What the hell had happened?\n\nI glanced all around. The design of the hallway was familiar, but everything was *off.* I could hear people talking in the rooms, but the immediate vicinity was devoid of all people but myself.\n\nNothing made sense.\n\nThen I looked up.\n\nAnd I’ll be honest, I peed just a little when I read the sign.\n\n*ST.

It was a remarkable feat of engineering, this little beast; designed with such care that even the equipment on the hull could withstand more water pressure than the sea could muster up at any achievable depth. It was my Pegasus. My Trojan Horse; my very own *Apollo 11* - and inside this matrix of layered syntactic foam I would follow the ballasts to the gratuitous and unexplored depths of Higgin’s Maw. \n\n\nI began the separation sequence, and the deep-diver fell away from the escort and dipped beneath the surface of the Pacific with silence and grace and a few knots of speed, and then I was consumed in a whole new world - albeit one I’d frequented - that of the sea. Schools of fish swam on by me, and when their cloud passed through a sunbeam it glinted silver, and beneath them swam rays that rolled their wings to the beat of the current, and out in the rocks crawled the crustaceans and sat the plant life that spruced up all the white-washed stones there like holiday ornaments. But I had an appointment to keep, and the oxygen tank was a demanding clock, so I dove right on past the old reef and out into the open waters where the seabed couldn’t be seen for many, many miles yet. \n\n\n*”The Maw,” Reuben had said. “Fifty thousand feet below the surface, Booker. Fifty* thousand. *Do you know what that means?”*\n\n\n*”Means its a whole hell of a lot deeper down than the Challenger Abyss.”*\n\n\n*He’d nodded at that. “Are you ready to make history?”*\n\n\nWas I? I thought I was. I’d prepared for this lonely dive and nothing else, for some years now. It was the culmination of a lifetime of work and study in the field, and so tight was its grip on my mind that I often dreamt of it in my sleep; of what I’d find at the bottom, and what it would mean. *And what monstrous things might take offense to my presence there.*\n\n\nNo. *No.* I shoved that thought aside. *Tuscany* was all the protection I needed in that regard; it offered technology on the bleeding edge in lieu of a heavy hull, and that was enough to withstand enough water pressure to crush bones beneath skin and inches of steel. What animal had jaws more powerful than the ocean itself at fathom?\n\n\nSo I hit the thrusters, and down I went, like a bullet to the pitch. I eyed the depth meter as much as I did the sea. One hundred feet. Two hundred. Sharks and turtles and uncountable fish swept past me. Three hundred feet. Five hundred feet. Seven hundred. A thousand. Twelve-fifty - *the inversed height of the Empire State building.* Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. \n\n\nThe water began to blur and grain up and darken as the sunlight struggled to push on through. Two thousand. Twenty five. Three thousand. Thirty two - *where the light no longer shines.* \n\n\nAnd soon all the light I had to spill glow to the path ahead and down, were the lights of the *Tuscany.*\n\n\nI continued the descent for hours. The pressure meter ticked up in spasmic bursts, but up it went, up, up, up, soon ticking past the point where the weight of the sea would’ve crushed the steel of another vessel. One mile down. One point three. One point six - *where even Sperm Whales hit their lowest dive.* I could now claim with confidence that no mammal on earth was as deep down at that very moment as myself. And still I dove. Two miles. Two point one. Two point two. \n\n\nThe water was as black as space now, except for where the lights of the *Tuscany* pierced through it, and the thickness of the fluid made it look like ink or oil or some kind of alien sludge that smeared up against the reinforced windows and slimed its way across the hull. Things were tight down here, despite the vastness of it all, yet still I dove. \n\n\nThirteen thousand feet. *The Abyssal zone. Pressure stands at 11,000 psi.* I saw an Angler float by, and it was startled by the sheer volume of light spread by the *Tuscany* that dwarfed its own bioluminescent glow. It swam away, and I dove further. Fifteen thousand feet. Three miles. Three point one. \n\n\n*Now things get interesting.*\n\n\nMankind had visited these depths almost infrequently enough to count the expeditions on a single pair of hands. I was now ranked among an illustrious few explorers, and although I wasn’t the first to hit these marks, I’d hit the deepest one yet before this journey was over. I was determined and I was capable. So I checked the depth chart. *Sixteen thousand, two hundred eighty one point four feet.* Nearly halfway to the world record. The *Tuscany* continued its dive.\n\n\nTwenty thousand feet down. *The Hadal zone. Pressure here is eleven hundred times what it is at the surface.* Twenty two thousand feet. Twenty six. Twenty nine thousand - *The height of Mount Everest.* Thirty. Thirty point five. Thirty one - *the same distance from the surface as a commercial airliner at the peak of its flight.* \n\n\nThe Challenger Deep, what had previously been the lowest recorded place on the seabed, sat at roughly 36,000 feet below the surface, in the depths of the Mariana Trench. No light from the sun had ever come close, and to the best accounts life existed there, but only sparsely, and the pressure is unspeakable. \n\n\nBut I was going somewhere vastly deeper, even, than that. \n\n\n*”All we know is we found a canyon,” Reuben had said. “Dwarfs the Grand - sitting dead center in the Pacific seabed. ‘Bout twelve hundred kilometers west of Hawaii, and another nine hundred south, and, near as we can figure, some fifty thousand feet straight on down.”*\n\n\nThirty six thousand feet. I was now tied for the world record. \n\n\n“*Fifty thousand feet?! Why the hell are we just now seeing it?”*\n\n\nThirty six five. I did it. My heartbeat swept up to a faster rhythm. I was officially a world record holder; no human being in recorded history had been as deep below the surface as I was at that very moment. \n\n\n*“New seabed scanning technology helped. Gave us a more detailed topographical map of the hydrosphere than we’ve ever had before, and once we got back the results, we took a look, and there it was. Just waiting for us. Inviting us down.”*\n\n\nThirty seven. \n\n\n*”So what’s down there?*\n\n\nThirty seven three.\n\n\n*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* \n\n\nThirty seven nine.\n\n\n*”I suppose not.”*\n\n\nThirty eight.\n\n\nThirty eight five. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*The awful spirits of the deep*\n\n*Hold their communion there;*\n\n*And there are those for whom we weep,*\n\n*The young, the bright, the fair.*\n\n\nHiggin’s Maw, according to the best information available to me at the time of departure, is a pit, roughly a full kilometer across. It begins at approximately forty six thousand feet below the surface and is estimated to bottom out at Higgin’s Deep, a small valley that sits at its base, some five thousand additional feet below that. The Maw is the largest and deepest such formation in the hydrosphere, and yet its dimensions and location are the only things concretely known about it. That, of course, is where myself, and where the *Tuscany,* come in.\n\n\nForty three thousand feet down. I hit the floodlights underneath the *Tuscany,* and the glow washed over an alien landscape that likely hadn’t seen light in over a billion years. There were mountains here - *mountains* - ones that rivaled the Alps, and wild arches and plateaus that stretched far off to a murky horizon before being shrouded by seawater. \n\n\nI even saw *life* down here in the depths. A squid-like thing of simply monstrous size swam on by my boat. It stopped for a moment, and during that moment I thought it might take offense to me, but after looking hard at the *Tuscany* and brushing a tentacle down the port side it swam off in search of other things. \n\n\n“Atta girl.”\n\n\nI descended further. \n\n\nForty four thousand feet. Forty five. \n\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, there it was. *The Maw.*\n\n\nMy mouth hung by the jaw as the sheer scope of the beast came into view. It was a breathtaking sight to behold; a monstrously large and equally dark hole in the crust of the earth that plummeted to inconceivable fathoms. I descended a bit further - forty five five, forty six thousand feet - and *Tuscany* fell into its yawn. Somehow things were even blacker in the depths of the thing, even though sunlight had long since been blotted out. \n\n\nForty six five. Forty seven. Forty seven two.\n\n\nI began to become aware of a low current pulling me downward. It wasn’t particularly powerful, but it was unexpected and it was therefore alarming. And yet I couldn’t bear to pull myself back up. Not yet - *I’ll turn around if it gets bad* - so down I went, deeper and deeper and deeper still into the cavern. \n\n\nForty eight thousand feet. Forty eight five. Forty nine. Forty nine one. \n\n\nAnd then I saw it. A glow. \n\n\nI squinted and dimmed my lights to confirm the intuition. *What in the name of God…?* It was there indeed, a dim reddish-purple, then green, then purple again, and then blue, floating on a mist of current some few thousand feet down. I resumed the dive to chase it. Forty nine five. Forty nine seven. Forty nine nine. The glow, whatever it was, was getting deeper, and wider, and brighter. Soon it filled up the whole path down and ahead. I dimmed the *Tuscany’s* under-lights to their lowest setting, and by fifty thousand feet I could see that the glow was coming from somewhere not directly beneath me, but off to the left and around a wide corner. \n\n\n*This cave isn’t a straight pit.* And sure enough, the hole bottomed out here, and then opened up to its left. \n\n\n*Holy God. Holy* God.\n\n\nIt was a cavern chamber, at least a full kilometer up and deep and side to side and across, and only the enormity of its radius maintained the darkness of it despite the presence of thousands of floating bioluminescent pods that pulsed purple and green and blue and red and dimmed in the interim. I took the *Tuscany* in deeper, and her cameras whirred to life. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*Calmly the wearied seamen rest*\n\n*Beneath their own blue sea.*\n\n*The ocean solitudes are blest,*\n\n*For there is purity.*\n\n\nThe cavern became darker still when the pods faded into the water behind the ship. But there were more things to be seen here than rocks. *Tuscany,* about a quarter hour after entering the chamber, soon floated on by a bizarrely rope-like plant of utterly impossible size; one that appeared to stretch nearly across the height of the cave and grew wider at the base, although the bottom of it was shrouded in blackness. I took the submarine in for a closer inspection, and hit her lights to their fullest setting. \n\n\n*Clack.* \n\n\nMy heartbeat slammed. There were suction cups on it. Each one as big as the *Tuscany* herself, and they writhed and pulsed across and down the full length of what was now very clearly a *tentacle.* In a panic I shoved *Tuscany* back and away from the thing, but when I tried to turn her around, the base of the hull collided with the beast and stuck fast to one of the cups. I gunned the thrusters and could hear a wet tearing sound as the machine ripped itself free from the cup’s grasp. \n\n\nBut then the tentacle came to life. It whipped and whirled and smacked around the cavern, and pressed itself to the roof, and then it fell down, deep beyond where the darkness blanketed the floor. \n\n\n“C’mon, baby.” I hit the thrusters again, and *Tuscany* rocketed off the way it came, through the darkness and off towards the pods, whose glow I hoped would afford me an opportunity to shut the lights off the ship and make my escape. \n\n\nIf I were so lucky. \n\n\nBut very soon I began to hear and *feel* the movement of something unspeakably *titanic* rolling across the floor of the chamber. It rumbled and thundered, and shuddered and shook, and soon clouds of dirt and rock flew up out of the black pitch and blanketed the view forward and I could hear boulders smack against the ceiling of the cave before sinking again to where they'd been. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n“F-fuck!!” The sound had erupted across the entire breadth of the cave at once. My eardrums nearly burst and likely would have, had it not been for muffling of the explosion provided by the walls of the *Tuscany.* The submarine shook, too, but she held up her integrity well enough to for me to fly on past the floating pods, some of which were now knocked about on their sides and rolling, and back towards the yawning mouth of the tunnel that would take me back out into the open deep s-\n\n\n*SMACK!!*\n\n\nThe *Tuscany* buckled and rolled with an impact. The Tentacle, I realized, had shot up from the ground and hit the bottom of the ship between her ballasts, but luckily it knocked her with force up towards the tunnel. I rolled *Tuscany* with the hit and managed to regain some control, and I boosted the thrusters into the turn and up again, now back into the Maw. Then I began to climb. \n\n\nFifty two thousand feet. Fifty one five. Fifty one. \n\n\n*”So what’s down there?*\n\n\n“Come on, baby. Come on. Don’t you fail me now. Don’t you *fucking* fail me now.”\n\n\n*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* \n\n\nFifty point five. Fifty. Forty nine nine. Forty nine six. *Tuscany* ascended with panicked speed, and all the while she did it I could feel the rumbling of the Tentacle’s pursuit in the walls of the Pit. It smashed its way on through the tunnel, and whipped and thrashed, but *Tuscany* was too quick a runner. *Forty seven five. Forty seven. Forty six eight. Forty six four. Forty six thousand feet and climbing high.* \n\n\n*”I suppose not.”*\n\n\n*Tuscany* burst out of the Maw and was about to rocket straight on back up to the surface, but then the Tentacle flew out beside her nearly smashed in her front window. I bent the controls to the edge of their set-casing, and *Tuscany* tanked to the left and up a bit and missed the ground by inches. I hit the lights again to navigate the labyrinth of rocks as I struggled to remount the climb. \n\n\nBut in the light of the ship I saw it; these weren’t rocks after all - *they were other ships.* Massive vessels, Imperial warships from ages past, bent and crooked and broken at the bottom of the sea, pulled down here by whatever it was that now threw its back to my devouring. \n\n\nThe Tentacle smashed along behind me. Mainmasts and battlements and flat-decks and rusted iron and wooden boat hulls were splintered up and tossed to the winds of the sea, never again to reconvene. I took *Tuscany* through this nautical graveyard with far, far too much speed for my safety. Under ship towers we went, and through cannon mounts and past the blades of dead engines and around upended rudders. \n\n\nThe cacophony of my flight and the destructive path set by my hunter awoke the life in the place. Fish washed out of holes, and cabins, and captain’s quarters and deep-deck stair flights and soon joined me in my effort to escape. \n\n\nBut it seemed there was no escape to be found here. The entire ground for countless miles shook and rumbled with seismic force. It was thunderously loud, and it picked up speed and violence with time. *Tuscany* finally flew up to miss a splintered crow's nest atop the mast by less than a foot, and finally used that directed momentum to put away distance between the seabed and herself with as many knots of speed as her thrusters would allow without bursting from the effort. The depth chart began to rise. \n\n\n*Forty five nine. Forty five two. Forty five thousand feet. Forty four eight.*\n\n\n“Come on, you motherf-”\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe water itself seemed to shift with the sound. And then, out of nowhere, *Tuscany* was no longer the only thing spilling light to the Abyss; an orange glow flashed across the sea and for an instant illuminated nearly the entirety of its vastness. Then it blinked, and then flicked on again and stayed active. I shut off *Tuscany’s* lights to preserve every molecule of power for the ascent. \n\n\n*Forty four two. Forty four. Forty three seven.*\n\n\nBeside me in the glow I could make out other creatures retreating, too. Ones of spectacular size, again, that mankind had never catalogued and that I, sadly, would not have time at all to study. There were city-bus sized manta ray shaped things, wrapped up in clouded wisps of transparent jelly, and even that squid the size of a building, all flying upwards in a mass panic. I led the charge. \n\n\n*Forty three one. Forty two eight. Forty two three. Forty two.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI looked behind me and down through the rear window. The Maw had moved. It was alive. *God almighty. I was in the Leviathan’s throat. I was in its fucking throat!* I saw its Tentacle tongue lash out of the Maw and collect enough fish to feed a small town. *Tuscany* rocketed ever upwards as the Leviathan whipped even larger Tentacles behind it and gained speed with the force of a hurricane. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe Leviathan opened its Maw yet again and spewed forth its tentacle tongue, and with it it whipped up several Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water into a gale-force maelstrom. The Mammoth Squid was caught in its fury, I saw, and then it vanished into the pit forever when the Maw snapped shut with a thunderous, echoing *snap.* \n\n\n*Tuscany,* meanwhile, continued to rocket upwards, and managed to escape the whirlpool by a foot. \n\n\n*Thirty nine five. Thirty nine. Thirty eight seven. Thirty eight two. Thirty eight thousand feet, and climbing.*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan pursued me relentlessly, riding on the flood of its own current. Its tentacles - each dozens of feet across and a mile long, beat the water back and tried to gain speed for their host. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Thirty seven five. Thirty seven. Thirty six four.* \n\n\n*Tuscany* had proved her worth with speed, and the pressure gauge now fell in jumps. It remained in the red and would for some time, but it was falling steadily, even as the depth chart rose. \n\n\n*Twenty nine thousand feet. Twenty eight three. Twenty seven five.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan hadn't given up the chase. Not yet. I could *feel* it doubling its efforts. The displaced water rocked the *Tuscany* and she buckled and rolled in the synthetic current. Then I heard the Maw open up behind me and the water begin to whip and swirl itself into a frenzy by the oceanload. I punched the thrusters to breaking point. \n\n\n“Come *on!!*” The encasing syntactic foam was pressed to its limits; the reinforced glass began to chip every so very slightly, but the chips broke into cracks and those cracks began to crawl across the width of the windows. I checked the gauges. Twenty thousand feet. Nineteen eight. Nineteen four. Nineteen three. The ascent was slowing. *Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Please God. Be with me now. Be w-*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nIn the orange glow of the Levianthan’s eyes I could see how quickly the water was slipping by *Tuscany* and getting swept up into the maelstrom. The submarine began to sway port to starboard and shudder and shake. *Seventeen four. Seventeen thousand. Sixteen nine. Sixteen three. Sixteen one. Sixteen thousand.*\n\n\nI watched the gauge with a nauseating desperation. \n\n\n*Fifteen nine five. Fifteen nine two.*\n\n\nI could feel her slowing to a crawl. *Come on. Come on. Come on!*\n\n\n*Fifteen nine two five. Fifteen nine four. Fifteen nine six. \n\n\n“Shit!!” And that was it; *Tuscany* was caught, and no sooner did the depth chart begin to slip then did I feel the whole submarine lose all sense of control and tumble backwards and around. I was thrown out of my seat and smacked my nose against the roof of the pilot sphere. Blood exploded, and it drenched my shirt and sprayed the glass and the entirety of the control set. \n\n\nI grabbed my face and began to apply pressure to slow the blood loss, but *Tuscany* again flipped ballast over ballast to starboard in the whirlpool and spilled me into the hatch ladder. I felt my shoulder dislocate and my kneecap smack into the bottom rung. My head swam, and still *Tuscany* tumbled backwards. The cracks on the windows spread faster. \n\n\n*Sixteen three. Sixteen four.*\n\n\nI could *smell* the inside of the Maw though the hull of the ship. \n\n\nBut then, all at once and not a moment too soon, I got an idea. It wasn’t a particularly good one, but hell if it wasn’t better than nothing - I managed to limp and tumble my way to the controls and grip the handles as the ship rolled. *Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait…*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Now!* The sound of the roar was so close every last control surface in the sphere rattled in its case. My eardrums rattled, too, but then I flared up the thrusters again, full blast and at an angle, and the *Tuscany* shuddered and flipped and shook and, with fortune, fell straight out of the maelstrom with inches to spare. I felt the edge of the Leviathan’s Maw graze the starboard side, and the impact again sent me into the roof while the ship rolled end over end over end again. I smacked my ribs up on a dip in the alcove and fell back down into the seat, head first, and then out onto the floor. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI managed to right myself with my good arm and get my bearings. I was free, but only just; the *Tuscany* banked and tumbled again and rolled, slower now in the absence of the whirlpool’s flood current, but not yet in control of its pull. I tried to steer away, but it was useless; the ship flipped around the back of the Leviathan’s titanic Maw and up over its head as the beast flew on by underneath me like a freight train. And for the first time since catching the monster’s eye I began to fully appreciate the magnitude of its size. \n\n\nIt’s back was an endless, snake like and sharp-finned spine the size of a minor mountain range, and only quick maneuvering moved *Tuscany* away from the jagged back fins that chugged up towards me and sliced open the sea itself. They missed me by feet, and the blast of the current they’d swept up sent the submarine reeling backwards, off a bit further and into relative safety. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!*\n\n\nI quickly dimmed the lights to their lowest setting and caught my breath, as the full form of the Leviathan washed on past me. It stretched far away into the abyss below, for well over a mile, and dragging away behind it were thousands upon thousands of tentacles, a forest of the things, each the size of a six lane highway and tipped with razor sharp hooks and a flurry of wing-fins. It took a full three minutes for the beast to pass by me fully. And then it curved around in the other direction, and swam off in search of other things to devour. \n\n\n*Gggggggrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!*\n\n\nThe form soon slipped away into a shadow. And then it was gone. \n\n\n---\n\n\nI surfaced hours later, having allowing the battered *Tuscany* to take its time with the journey. She was solely responsible for my escape - my quick thinking be damned. *A marvel of engineering indeed.* \n\n\nOnce I did break the surface I disbursed a distress beacon and then promptly collapsed from exhaustion. Evidently, I was picked up by the Coast Guard some hours after that, a few hundred miles southwest of Hawaii, and pulled from the near-wreckage of my submarine and taken to a hospital on the mainland. It was there that I woke up a full day later. \n\n\nAs I recovered I heard some isolated chatter of tremendous seismic activity near where I’d been, and how the whole ocean floor had changed and moved and shifted form. But I couldn't care less. I told the bastards what I knew. And on top of that, they have the *Tuscany* and they have all the recorded evidence, and you now have this written account. What everyone does with this information now, is entirely up to them. \n\n\nAll I know is that I won't be doing any more diving any time soon. I’ve come to a realization: that mankind has more than enough space to expand throughout and live upon and thrive in above and near the surface, and on land, and in the skies and soon, hopefully, out there amongst the stars. \n\n\nBut there are things in the sea that hold ownership of the deep. And perhaps it's best to leave it that way.

It’s called Lucky’s, which is a little ironic because if you’ve ended up here you’re anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky’s you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I’ve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my “Where you heading?” has been “Anywhere but back.” The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee’s hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they’ll ever have, and I’m inclined to agree. \n\nThe embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain’t even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky’s has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It’s like she’s still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn’t buried in the cemetery just past the strip club. \n\nLucky’s is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there’s nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky’s I’ve seen all sorts of lost things. \n\nI once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining. \n\nI’ve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I’ve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I’ve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don’t look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can’t quite hold up the pretence that long. I’ve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I’ve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I’d consider letting them harvest me. \n\nBut this is a story about - well, you read the title. \n\nIt was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I’m going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I’d taste salt on the air. That, and I’m one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky’s, and only two had showed so far. \n\nRose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky’s when sleep was hiding from her. \n\nShe continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she’d read your coffee grounds. I didn’t ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true. \n\nTable 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.\n\nOur second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I’d ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.\n\nHe smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms. \n\nSometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn’t take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet. \n\n“Tired today?” I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he’d pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he’d been dreaming about her. She’d been found without her shoes on. He’d carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on ‘em, small in his arms like she was asleep.  \n\nLou the fry cook had cried when I’d told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we’re always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there’s a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart. \n\n“Always tired,” Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself. \n\nI walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while. \n\nThe other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he’d used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he’d look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he’d done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He’d never seen the ocean. \n\nLou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get. \n\nThey often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies’ guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them. \n\nI cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads. \n\nNeither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims. \n\n“I know where I buried him Sylvia-,”\n“You don’t know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-”\n\nMy mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn’t there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it’s not polite to listen to other people’s conversations. You never know what you’ll wish you hadn’t heard. \n\nLou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone. \n\nCarlos handed me a plate of pancakes. \n\nCarlos had worked here so long he’d known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky’s pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn’t working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I’d learnt that the hard way, but that’s another story. \n\nAlong with the pancakes, came a warning. \n\n“He’s back.” He gestured through the doors. “Table 6.” \n\nOur final regular had showed. It had been a while since he’d been around. I hadn’t even seen him come in, but that wasn’t unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page. \n\nWe leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. “Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.” Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.\n\nI don’t get paid enough for this shit. \n\nI took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I’d looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.  \n\nI tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There’s something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl. \n\n“Can I get you anything?” I asked, faking bright. \n\n“I’d take your name.” He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush. \n\nI tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth. \n\n“Isabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don’t suit.” He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed. \n\n“There’s no need for that,” came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince. \n\nI turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you’ve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn’t want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you’re gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people. \n\nMr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn’t notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you’d think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South. \n\n“I’m sorry for my… acquaintance. He’s a little…” Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. “…over excited.” Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.  \n\nMr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they’re watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn’t moved. \n\n“Besides, Leroy ain’t the type for salt. He’s just a man.” He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. “Barely.” He turned to Leroy. “I see you started on my pancakes. But what’s the point of good food if it ain’t for sharing.” Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system. \n\nMr Prince handed Leroy a menu. “Order whatever you want.” He leant forward and the lights flickered.\n\nLeroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. “Well, if that’s all!” I managed. I could feel Leroy’s eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen. \n\n“I wouldn’t worry about him, darlin’.” She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. “We won’t be seeing him again.” She wasn’t talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.  \n\nI finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water. \n\n“Lou! Jesus fuckin’ Christ, get off I’m-“ I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. “I think I’m good.” I wasn’t really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession. \n\n“Sorry! Just checkin’.” Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. “Already did me ’n’ Carlos.” He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.\n\nCarlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. “Maybe you need some more,” I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted. \n\nSometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.\n\nIt was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I’d been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic. \n\n“You taste better than they will,” he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I’d left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince’s plate.\n\n“Tell Carlos the pancakes were… good as hell,” he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he’d said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.\n\nI walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.\n\n“Is he botherin’ you?” He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two.\n“Nothing I can’t handle,” I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. “We won’t be seeing him again.” \n\nIt felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don’t look at him, he doesn’t bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary. \n\nAt 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat. \n\n“See Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,” he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. “For I will not acquit the wicked,” he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy’s hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child’s shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head. \n\nHe seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. “For your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.”  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over. \n\nMr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. “We’ve got a ways to go, the road we’re takin’. They say it’s paved with good intentions.” He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy’s hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again. \n\nI placed the shoes on the table by Jone’s empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there’s nothing left to say. \n\nMy shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything."},"289":{"title":"I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying [Part 3]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmyq8g\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":"Series","author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"[Read Part 1 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q0gn&sh=f6440917)\n\n[Read Part 2 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dm86h5\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q1qh&sh=b655a8d9)\n\nAfter another dozen hours or so, I opened the bathroom door. The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn’t smell any sulfur. \n\nI cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I’d ever eaten. \n\nWhen I’d finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?\n\nI crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They’d almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.\n\nShe had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. \n\n“Mary!” I hissed.\n\nShe pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. “Yeah? What’s going on?”\n\n“Are you ok?” I asked. “What did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?”\n\n“I’m sorry, remind me how I know you?”\n\n“What do you mean? We just-” I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. “Mary, how long have you been on this flight?”\n\nShe checked the watch on her wrist. “Well it’s 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.” She stared at me the same way you’d look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. “Hey, don’t worry so much. Look on the bright side; we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nI felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. “Sir, this area is for first-class passengers only.” \n\nThey were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. \n\nI was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. \n\nIn retrospect, those few days weren’t so bad. There’s a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn’t get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.\n\nIt was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn’t come for several minutes, but eventually one did.\n\n“Just...just let me see the Captain,” I asked.\n\nThe flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: “I’m sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn’t answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.”\n\n“How long?”\n\n“Quite a while I’m afraid. Don’t worry though sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.” She straightened and walked away.\n\nI started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched a given movie, that sort of thing. \n\nIt was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.\n\nI’d guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. \n\nTwo months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. \n\nI got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn’t work, I’d find some other more painful way to go. \n\nI grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it’d been for the past who-knew how long. \n\nThe open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant’s hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. \n\nThe wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn’t want to die after all. \n\nIt grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.\n\nI impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I’d hit it on the seat in front of me.\n\n“No,” I whispered. Then shouted. “NO! NO! NO!”\n\nA flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. “Are you OK sir?”\n\nI clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. \n\nShe wasn’t grinning.\n\nShe wasn’t crying. \n\nTo be honest she looked a little scared of me.\n\nI reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. \n\n4:04 AM.\n\n“Sir, if you can calm down we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nMy mouth tasted like ash. “Thank you,” I managed. “I will.”\n\nI stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.\n\nThen I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. \n\nWe did land in about an hour. I can’t even begin to explain why or how, but I’m currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I’m free. I’m out.\n\nAnd I’m never going flying again.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nEDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[Want more?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WorchesterStreet\/comments\/gbpc8t\/a_huge_storm_swept_through_my_town_a_week_ago_it\/)"},"290":{"title":"When we turn 18, we get the name of our soulmate.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/","flair":"Series","author":"thewackwaffle","selftext":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nqtu23\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Final](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nvzhya\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/)\n\nI was young when I realized that the place I lived was special.\n\nI didn’t realize it at first, since I had lived there my whole life. I thought it was normal for a city to not allow pets. I grew up never hearing the sounds of barking dogs, or hissing cats. No one that lived inside the city border was allowed to have them.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to have mandatory blood testing every week, with no explanation or seemingly any reason.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to not have any jails.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to give their citizens soulmates.\n\nI never really understood how it worked. All that we were told was that there were the Matchmakers, who were responsible for making the matches, and sending out the tiny slips of paper that determined each citizen’s love life, and future. No one ever saw the Matchmakers. No one knew how they were recruited, no one knew how they worked. All anyone knew was that it worked.\n\nWhere I lived, there has never been a filing for divorce. The Matchmakers are never wrong.\n\nEach citizen received their paper on their 18th birthday. Inside the piece of paper, there was nothing except a name. The name of your supposed soulmate. There was no telling how you would come across this person, no when or how. All anyone knew was that it would eventually happen. We were allowed to tell other people, allowed to ask around, try and seek out people that had the same name as the one on the paper, but it didn’t matter. It couldn’t be forced.\n\nOf course, literal eternal love and happiness does not come without rules. Every citizen had to follow the Rules. They weren’t too strange, and seemed like a small price to pay for what you were getting in return. Most of the rules were simple. To name a few, there was no going outside, under any circumstances, after 2am. No pets, blood tests, etc. There were also rules that we weren’t allowed to know until we were older.\n\nWe got the new rules on our 18th birthday, the same day we got our Matchmaker paper. We called them Slips.\n\nAs I got older, I realized that our city was special, and that other cities didn’t have what we had, but I didn't care. Life was good, life seemed simple. Our city was like a little paradise. It was happy. It was without issue.\n\n||\n\nIt was the night before my 18th birthday, and I couldn’t sleep. This was to be expected, since knowing that the next morning, you would know the name of your literal *soulmate* was enough to keep anyone up late.\n\nUsually, I wouldn’t have believed in such things like soulmates, especially as I got older, but it was hard to argue with evidence. My parents had gotten married in their late 20s, and have stayed happily married ever since, both of their names matching what was on their Slips. My older sister Katlin got her Slip last year, and though she’s been through her fair share of failed relationships, she’s currently in a happy one with some guy named Roger. I don’t think I need to tell you the name that was on her Slip.\n\nI wished Katlin still lived with us. We used to share a room, but ever since she moved out, it feels empty with just me in it. By some miracle, I eventually fell asleep, my brain finally exhausted after hours of wondering what tomorrow was going to bring.\n\nI woke up the next morning, my arm groping for my alarm to turn it off, just like any other day. It wasn’t until I sleepily sat up that I realised that today wasn’t like any other day.\n\nI swung my legs out of bed, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to compose myself. I wanted to pull on a shirt and shorts as fast as possible, rush to the kitchen to get the envelope I knew would be addressed to me, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to be one of those people who’s entire lives suddenly revolved around trying to find their soulmate. I needed to be calm.\n\nTaking a few even breaths, I slowly put on a shirt and some basketball shorts, before opening my door. Chatter, and the smell of waffles hit my senses instantly as I stepped out of my room. Turning the corner, I stopped, grinning.\n\n“Katlin!” I said, unable to contain my excitement at seeing her. Reaching her in a few short steps, I wrapped my arms around her in a hug, to which she enthusiastically returned. “What are you doing here?” I said, pulling myself away to look at her.\n\n“Aw, you seriously thought I would miss your birthday? Get real.” She said, matching my grin as she looked at me. “*Damn* you got tall.” She said, looking at me. “He got it from his old man.” My dad chimed in, and Katlin rolled her eyes. Besides my height, I got a lot from my dad. I got his warm brown eyes, and I got his wavy, dirty blonde hair that I had always kept medium-length. I looked so much like my dad that my mom always chimed in saying how I got her nose and smile.\n\n“Happy birthday hon.” My mom said from the counter, giving me a soft smile. “These are almost done, and we’ll go out for your birthday dinner later tonight.” She said, gesturing at the waffles, and I smiled. “Birthday waffles for the birthday boy.” My dad chimed in, putting an arm around my mom, and the simple movement made me remember something I forgot in the midst of the excitement. “Is it- is it here?” I asked them, trying to keep my voice even.\n\nMy sister nodded, understanding what I was talking about. “On the front table.” My legs felt like rubber as I walked the few steps into the hallway, instantly seeing the stark white envelope on the table. I picked it up.\n\n*| Deliver to: Theodore Shillings |*\n\nI walked back to the kitchen, all eyes on me as I turned the envelope over, trying to act calm, act normal.\n\nI opened the envelope, pulling out two pieces of paper. One of them, I knew would be the new rules. The other one, was my Slip. I looked at the bigger paper first.\n\n*To people(s) registered as 18 years as older, the following rules will come into effect.*\n\n1. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted in city waters. This includes all local rivers within city limits.*\n2. *Under no circumstances will anyone 18 years or older be allowed to watch the television on the 14th of every month.*\n3. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use faucets after 12am. This includes sinks, bathtubs, and showers.*\n4. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use any kind of elevator after 9pm.*\n5. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to share their rules with people(s) under the age of 18.*\n\nAnd that was it. I honestly expected more, but was relieved there wasn’t too many that I would have to memorize. They were weird, sure, but nothing that I wouldn’t be able to do. After re- reading the new Rules, I put the paper down, heart hammering as I took my slip. Wanting to get it over with, I opened it, to which a single name was printed.\n\n*Avery*\n\nI read, and re-read the name several times. Avery. Avery. *Avery.*\n\nI racked my brain for people I knew named Avery. There was a girl in my history class, and maybe one who I had pre calc with a few years ago? Before I could wonder further, Katlin’s voice cut me off. “What’s the name?” She said, to which I handed it to her. It passed from her, to my mother, then my father. “Avery. Nice name.” My dad said, handing my Slip back to me. Chatter resumed between my parents and Katlin, while my mind was whirring.\n\nSome things made more sense now, like why I never saw adults kayaking in the river like I saw them do in other cities. I had told myself for a long time that once I got my Slip, that I wouldn’t focus too much on it, but my mind kept coming back to the name that was burned into my mind. *Avery*.\n\nI still had to go to school, and got ready while Katlin went out to reconnect with some high school friends. I ignored my texts asking what the name on my Slip was, preferring to have that conversation in person.\n\nMy friends were waiting for me at the bus stop eagerly. There was Jennifer, who was usually pretty quiet, and who I’d known since preschool. There was Joseph, who was a bit of a daredevil and a jock who I’d met during my freshman year. Lastly, there was Charles and Sophia, twins who were never separated, and who I’d bonded with sophomore year over our love for horror movies. Looking at us as a group looked weird, but we worked, and had fun with each other.\n\nI was bombarded with the same question as I got close to them.\n\n“Who’s name did you get?”\n\n“Avery.” I said, the first time I had actually said the name. It sounded nice, coming out of my mouth, It sounded right. My friends nodded, followed by a moment of silence that meant that they were all trying to think of Avery’s that we knew.\n\n“Isn’t there a chick in your history class named Avery?” Joseph offered, and I nodded. “Yeah. I’m trying not to think about it too much, I don’t wanna become one of those people who become obsessed with it.” I said, although the name was really all I could think about.\n\nMy friends dropped it after that, all except Joseph. He would chime in every few minutes, rattling off girls that he knew, all with the name Avery. He was still talking about it as the bus came, and as we walked up to the school. He really didn’t have an “off” button, which meant that I was left to try and tune him out, nodding my head in agreement every few minutes.\n\nAs the school day went on, I couldn’t help but wonder if each Avery I came across was my soulmate. Somehow though, none of the girls I came across felt right.\n\nEverything else aside, the school day went pretty smoothly. People wished me happy birthday in the halls, occasionally asking who I got on my Slip.\n\nAfter school, I still had time before I had to head home and start working on homework, so as usual, I met outside the school with my friends. The day had gotten progressively hotter as it went on, and by the time school was let out, it had reached the point of uncomfort. Most of my friends were already waiting for me, and as I got closer they were already in conversation.\n\n“-balls hot man, we should go claim a spot by the river before it gets too crowded.” Joseph was saying, to which my other friends nodded in agreement. The river he was referring to was the biggest in the city, almost cutting it in half. It was a popular hangout spot, and my friends and I had been going there for ages. But now,  my throat felt tight. None of my friends had turned 18 yet, since I had an extra year of preschool when I was a kid. They didn’t know the new rules.\n\nOne of the rules said I wasn’t allowed to tell them. Did that mean I also couldn’t hint at it?\n\n“Er, I’m not sure if I’m feeling the river today.” I said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.\n\n“Are you crazy? It’s like, 90 degrees out here.” Jennifer said, raising her eyebrows. Not wanting to act suspicious, I decided that I would go, but I wouldn't go in. Under any circumstances.\n\n“Alright let’s go, but I can’t stay long, I have my birthday dinner with Katlin and my parents.” I said, to which Joseph pumped his fist.\n\nRelieved that none of them seemed to suspect anything, we set off towards the river.\n\nThere were a couple other families there, with kids playing in the shallow water and the parents sitting safely on the edge.\n\nI took a few, even breaths to remind myself that I was fine, and that I would stay on the shore. Jennifer and Joseph were the first to the river, instantly pulling up their jeans and taking off their socks and shoes as they dipped them into the river, sighing with the relief that the cool water provided from the hot weather.\n\nI desperately wanted to be there with them, swimming in the river and enjoying the nice weather, but the rules were very clear. I sighed, sitting down a few feet away from the water, my legs out in front of me, watching as my friends splashed each other with the water. I just had to hold out until they had their birthdays, and then I wouldn’t have to make excuses. I could handle a few more months. “Oi! Come on birthday boy, get in the water!” Charles yelled, splashing water in my direction as he was ankle deep in it, a few feet away from where it dropped off into deeper waters. I smiled, shaking my head as I adjusted my legs to make myself more comfortable. “Nah, I’ll be the one to drive you guys to the hospital when you get hypothermia.” I yelled back, to which I could see his eyes roll from here.\n\n“Aw, we can’t have that!” Joseph called, wading back to where I was. “I command the birthday boy to get hypothermia with the rest of us!” Joseph said, smirking as he approached me. I felt a trickle of unease as he approached me. I stood up to move away, but just then he swooped down and picked me up over his shoulder. Joseph played for the football team, and I always admired his strength, but this was the first time I was afraid of it. “Joseph, stop! Put me down!” I yelled, panic rising in my voice, struggling to escape his arms as he was carrying me to the water.\n\nMy heart pounded wildly in my chest, as a rising fear crept up my throat. He outmatched me in size and strength, and my struggles were fruitless. “I’m serious Joseph, put me the fuck down!” I yelled, to which he gave a little laugh. “You’re always so serious Theo, loosen up! Live a little!” He replied, and I could see he was in the water now, wading further in. I looked at my friends, wide eyed, but they were giggling like it was a joke.\n\nThey had no idea.\n\nAs he got closer to the drop off, I struggled harder, hitting him on the shoulders. I wasn't weak by any standards, but Joseph was built like an ox, almost all muscle. Fear closed my throat so tightly, I couldn't breathe. “ Come on, everyone in the water!\" He said, motioning with his head to my friends, who obliged, standing on the edge of the drop. \"Alright on three, we’ll all jump in together.” He put his hands on my waist, and I knew what was coming. “One…. two…..” He started, rocking back and forth. “Joseph, stop! STOP!” I yelled, punching him harder, but it didn’t make any difference.\n\n“Three!”\n\nI heard the splashes of my friends jumping in, just as I was launched a few feet into the air.\n\nI didn't know what to expect.\n\nI shut my eyes tightly as images rapidly flashed through my mind. I saw myself at my ninth birthday party, saw myself applauding at Kaitlin's graduation. Rapid images throughout my life flashed before me.\n\nWas my life flashing before my eyes?\n\nIt felt like an eternity before I hit the water.\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what happened next.\n\nI hit the water hard, the cold water stinging every part of my body. The wind knocked out of me, but since nothing else happened immediately, I thought, fleetingly, that I was fine.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt felt like a giant vacuum was at the bottom of the river, sucking me towards it. I thrashed in the water, desperately trying anything to prevent myself from getting sucked deeper. I had been swimming in the deep part of the river before, and one summer my friends and I actually measured how deep it was, and I knew well enough that I was being pulled far beyond that. I was running out of air, and my panicked state wasn't helping the situation.\n\nWhatever was down there started to pull me faster, as if whatever it was could sense my desperation. My chest felt tight, as I could no longer hold my breath. My body started to go limp when suddenly- I was falling.\n\nI was no longer in water, and I took a gasp of breath, sputtering out the water that had managed to get in my mouth from my surprise. I was so relieved to be breathing again, that it took me a minute to realize I was falling rapidly through the air. Darkness surrounded me, and through my confused, dazed state I couldn't make out what was around me. A few seconds later, for the second time during the day, my body hit water again, hard.\n\nOnce again, I had the wind knocked out of me, and I could feel myself sinking. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.\n\nI didn't have the energy to panic. My eyes closed. I didn't know what I was supposed to think about. I didn't want my last thoughts before death to be wasted.\n\nIt was during these last thoughts that suddenly, something pulled me away from them.\n\nLiterally.\n\nI could feel something grabbing the back of my shirt, pulling me upwards, towards the surface. Confusion swept me as a moment later, I felt myself being heaved out of the water, and being roughly set down, on something hard, something solid. I gasped, coughing and sputtering as water dripped off of me.\n\nI shakily pushed myself onto my hands and knees, trying to get my breathing under control, my thoughts moving at the speed of light. I felt oddly light-headed, my body drained and exhausted. I wanted to look around for my savior, but I couldn't. My vision had started to go black, as my exhausted body finally collapsed.\n\n||\n\nSomeone was shaking me awake. My first, fleeting thought that it was my mom, telling me I was going to be late for school. Then I remembered. It was just a dream. I told myself. Just a dream. You'll open your eyes and mom is going to wish you a happy birthday, tell you you're going to be late for school-\n\nSomeone shook me harder. I opened my eyes. It was not my mom.\n\nIt was a boy, who looked around my age with dark, messy hair and who was looking at me with two dark blue concerned eyes, who looked relieved as I opened my eyes. \"Good. You're awake. Come on, we need to move.\" He said quickly, looking behind him. Confusion clouded my mind. \"Who- who are you? And where am I?\" I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. The boy looked back at me. \"My name is Avery. I can explain everything later, but we really have to go.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. Avery. Avery. Avery.\n\nOh, shit."},"291":{"title":"The terrifying note addressed to my six-year-old son","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63m9pe\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold_son\/","flair":"Series","author":"Creeping_dread","selftext":"My wife and I are beside ourselves right now. This is the type of thing you see in the movies, but now it’s happening to us.\n\nYesterday evening, a little after six, my wife and I were in the kitchen cooking dinner when my six-year-old (almost 7) son Kyle walked in from the back patio. He was holding a folded piece of paper in his hand and had a strange look on his face. My son is constantly drawing (and loves to read and write) so this usually wouldn’t have stood out to me at all, but he’d just come in from hitting the baseball off the tee and really had no reason to be holding a piece of paper. \n\nMy son is the type of kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve. When I asked to see the piece of paper, I could tell he didn’t really want to give it to me because he flashed his typical *I’m gonna be in trouble if I do* face. I insisted, and he finally handed it over. Here’s what it said:\n\n>Dear Kyle,\n\n>I know this note may sound scary,\n\n>(your daddy will think it is),\n\n>but grownups don’t know \n\n>how friendships can grow\n\n>when kids are just left to be kids.\n\n>And what a kid you’ve become, Kyle!\n\n>You’re growing as fast as a weed.\n\n>Last night off the tee\n\n>you stroked it for three\n\n>and your team took a two-run lead!\n\n>Yes, I’ve been watching (a while now, its true).\n\n>I think we would make perfect friends.\n\n>You’re a kid through and through,\n\n>And I am one too,\n\n>even if just for pretends.\n\n>The problem, I fear, is your parents.\n\n>(I doubt they would let us hang out).\n\n>One is just rude,\n\n>the other a prude,\n\n>church-going, pure, holy, devout.\n\n>I’ve got an idea\n\n>(can you tell my hand’s shaking?)\n\n>for me and you getting together!\n\n>Tomorrow at three,\n\n>you can come and see me\n\n>at the address attached to this letter.\n\n>But please (pretty please!)\n\n>don’t tell your dad!\n\n>Your mom and he won’t understand.\n\n>Just come by yourself,\n\n>I’ll be dressed as an elf!\n\n>And we can even hold hands!\n\n>Would you like that?\n\n>(You will! You really will Kyle!)\n\n>We will have (my oh my) so much fun!\n\n>So I’ll see you at three,\n\n>by the sycamore tree,\n\n>where our two kindred souls become one!\n\nThere was an address scribbled at the bottom of the page.\n\n>3 Orange Circle.\n\nI knew immediately it wasn’t a prank. \n\nCarrie, my wife, is the youth group leader at our church. And Kyle did just have a tee ball game last night. Orange Circle is only one street over from our street, and I'm pretty sure lot 3 is the corner lot on the culdesac, which has an empty house with a large sycamore tree in the backyard. \n\nWas this sicko really watching Kyle’s game? What would have happened I hadn’t seen him with the letter?\n\nI shouted for my wife to come read it. When she did, she flipped out, and ran for the phone to call the police. \n\nI flipped the note over, and on the back was some more text. I couldn’t read it at first, but quickly realized it was written backwards, I’m guessing so Kyle couldn’t have read it. To read it, I had to hold it up in front of a mirror:\n\n>And now (just in case)\n\n>if your Dad’s reading this,\n\n>it’s time to tell him a story.\n\n>If your mom flaps her hole\n\n>Or your dad tells a soul,\n\n>I’m afraid things might get rather gory. \n\n>On the 10th of July, \n\n>1995,\n\n>A woman named Susie went missing,\n\n>Susie, you see,\n\n>(unlike you and me)\n\n>wasn’t careful about who she’d been kissing.\n\n>I kept her a while (but old things get so boring!)\n\n>and in time I had gotten my fill.\n\n>I threw her away\n\n>and to my great dismay\n\n>the hunger I felt plagued me still.\n\n>I tried to bury it deep down inside\n\n>(where nothing down there can escape).\n\n>But lately it seems\n\n>I see Kyle in my dreams\n\n>And that hunger can no longer hide.\n\n>Now that you know what I’m capable of\n\n>(more than both of you can comprehend),\n\n> if one word is spoken,\n\n>then children get broken,\n\n>and Susie will have a new friend.\n\nThe police arrived in a half hour and we showed them the note. They told us to stay inside and lock the doors for the remainder of the night. The man had obviously been in our (fenced-in) back yard, which made me sick to my stomach and had me cursing myself for not installing the security camera I’d gotten for Christmas. \n\nNothing happened last night, thank God.\n\nThis morning, I got a call from the detective assigned to our case. He’d reviewed the list of missing persons cases from 1995 and something had turned up. \n\nSuzanne Kerrington went missing July 10th, 1995, just as the note said. The last person to see her alive was a friend who saw her at the 24-hour gym they attended together. Susie had said she’d met someone new and wanted to get a quick workout in before getting ready for their second date. Susie was never seen again and the man was never identified. \n\nAnd, maybe the worst part, was Suzanne's address. \n\n3 Orange Circle. \n\nI'm supposed to meet with the detective later this evening. \n\nWhat should we do?\n\nUPDATE: The detective just called back. They're sending an unmarked patrol car with two plainclothes officers to 3 Orange Circle at 3 p.m. today. Kyle's teachers have been notified and he's safe at school and won't be going to recess today. I'll update tomorrow with any news.\n\n[Update 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63uu1m\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold\/)\n\n***\n\n[Download the FREE audiobook!](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/RRPSp)\n"},"292":{"title":"Under The Back Porch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8zb8k9\/under_the_back_porch\/","flair":null,"author":"theoddcatlady","selftext":"As a kid I lived with neglectful parents at best. At worst dad would turn his screams and fists on me but I learned quickly how to dodge the worst of it. Mom wasn’t much help, she’d just smoke in the kitchen and bitch at him for staying out so late.\n\nAt the time we lived basically in the middle of nowhere, our nearest neighbors were a long walk away for a six year old and we had trees between us. No one to run to for help. But I was pretty small for a kid my age. I learned I could fit pretty much anywhere. The closet. Dryer. I think even once I tucked myself under my futon in such a way I could still get some air but no one could see me.\n\nI was a master at hiding. But it wasn’t for a good reason.\n\nOne night though, one night I chose to do something different.\n\nI could hear it in dad’s yells, he was pissed and was about to get violent. Mom wasn’t helping either, just piling fuel onto an inferno of a flame. So I knew I had to find a good hiding spot. I’d gotten the idea a few days before, when I realized the lattice covering the bottom half of the back porch had a hole in it. Not big enough to fit a full grown man, most likely, but it could fit a skinny six year old no problem.\n\nSo wrapping myself up in my blanket and grabbing my hippo stuffie, I snuck out my window and ran into the backyard. In the middle of autumn. When it was forty degrees out and the temperature was steadily dropping.\n\nI crawled under the porch, scraping my elbows and getting splinters in my palms but I fit inside. It was actually quite spacious compared to most my hiding spots, I couldn’t sit up all the way but I had plenty of room to spread out my limbs.\n\nOf course I was also getting covered in dirt. It’d rained a few days ago so the mud was still a little wet. I wrapped myself in my blankie the best I could and settled in for the night.\n\nBut soon, even with my blankie and my hippo, my teeth were chattering so hard I could barely breathe. I didn’t want to go back inside though, knowing if my dad caught me I’d be in for the whipping of my life. So I had to tough it out.\n\n“Honey, are you cold?”\n\nThat voice was not the voice of my mother, scratchy from all the smoking and screeching she did. It was sweet, like honey. I turned over to see the dim outline of a woman, lying on her stomach next to me. She had a pretty butterfly necklace and was just as dirty as I was.\n\nI nodded, not wondering how she’d been down there without me noticing.\n\nThe woman belly crawled forward and wrapped her arms around me and suddenly I became warm. Like I was sitting next to a campfire. I snuggled into her arms, not minding the mud, after all we were both dirty.\n\n“You’ve gotten so big,” the woman said, examining my face. “How old are you now, Alex?”\n\n“Six.” How did I know this woman again? I didn’t think I did.\n\n“Six!” The woman gasped. “You’re all grown up then. I’m so happy.” She sighed pleasantly and stroked my hair. I’d never felt so cozy in my life.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked.\n\nShe smiled, I could hear it in her voice. “I’m Lily. What’s your favorite thing to do?”\n\nI had to think for a second. “I like board games. And coloring.”\n\nLily chuckled. “Just like me then. Could never get enough of Scrabble. But I guess you’re still too young to play that, huh?”\n\nI nodded. “Lotsa words. I wanna play it though. I like the tiles. Would you play with me?”\n\nI heard Lily sharply inhale. “I… I don’t think I can. Your daddy put me under here, and I can’t leave… but…” She thought for a second. “Alex, could you do me a favor?”\n\n“Of course!” This lady was oh so nice. Why wouldn’t I do her a favor?\n\n“When you wake up in the morning, go to the police station. Ask for an officer by the name of Lowell Joyce. Tell him where to find Lily, okay? Under your back porch. He’ll come and he’ll get me, okay? And… and then maybe we can play Scrabble.”\n\nYippee! I was too excited about the possibility of playing Scrabble to notice how Lily’s voice caught at the end. I nodded vigorously. “I’ll do it! We can be on the same team, right?”\n\nLily softly laughed.\n\n“I’ll help you understand the rules. Goodnight, Alex.”\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard Lily’s voice.\n\n“Go now. Your dad’s gone to work. I’ll tell you how to get to the station.”\n\nRubbing my eyes, I crawled out from under the porch and went into the house to grab my shoes and a coat. I shivered in the frosty cold. But I thought Lily was right behind me.\n\nAfter my shoes and coat were on I started walking. It was long enough to get to the neighbor’s house. I really can’t remember how long it took to get to the police station, although I have no idea why no one pulled over to see what the hell a six year old in dirty pajamas was doing walking alongside the road. Lily kept guiding me onward.\n\n“Wait. Okay, cross the street now.”\n\n“Turn right here.”\n\n“Keep going! You’ve almost made it!”\n\nI nearly collapsed with exhaustion by the time I walked into the station. The guys out front chatting and having a good time didn’t see me until I almost made it to the front desk.\n\n“Whoa! Kid! You okay?” One of the officers knelt down to my level, eyes wide.\n\nI nodded. “I’m okay. Can I speak to Lowell Joyce?” I asked.\n\nOne of the other officers picked me up. “Sure kid, sure, let’s just get you someplace warm, holy shit your lips are blue…”\n\nI remembered quietly scolding the man about watching his language. ‘Shit’ was a bad word.\n\nI was given some warm cocoa and wrapped up in a blanket by the time an old man with a graying mustache sat by me.\n\n“Hey kid. I’m Sheriff Joyce. What’s your name?” He asked.\n\n“Alex.” I set down my cup and looked him straight in the eye. “I was told to tell you that Lily is under the back porch.  You need to go let her out so we can play Scrabble.”\n\nI had never seen a grown man turn pale before.\n\nLots of things blurred together at this point. I remember being taken back to my house and there were a lot of police cars and people around. The back porch was surrounded by yellow tape, and someone was taking a black bag away while my dad was in handcuffs.\n\nAfter that, I lived with my grandparents. Sheriff Joyce and his wife.\n\nI tried to ask about what happened and who was Lily but I always got shut down. I was too young to know.\n\nBut life got better. A lot better.\n\nGrandpa was the best man I could’ve hoped for in my life. We went out on weekends to the movies where he let me have the giant soda even though I’d have to pee in the middle of the movie. When I asked if I could drink when I was thirteen he let me try a beer. I spat it out and didn’t touch it again. He never judged me for my love of art, letting me paint my own bedroom multiple times over the years. I felt safe around him. He never laid a hand on me. My grandmother was amazing too, over the week she’d homeschool me along with teaching me things that you wouldn’t learn in a school, such as how to respect others but not take their crap. And cooking. Lots of cooking. I could make my own birthday cake by the time I was twelve. But I usually just made them for my friends. I got a lot of those, after I was free from my dad.\n\nWhen I turned sixteen, Grandpa took me back to my dad’s house.\n\nThe whole thing had been bulldozed over. But I could still see the yellow tape wound around a few trees, faded and torn.\n\nWe sat together on the back of his truck. He opened a beer and drank half of it before setting it down and grabbing me an orange soda.\n\nAfter I’d drank it he told me.\n\n“Lily was your mother.”\n\nGood thing he didn’t tell me as I was swallowing, I likely would’ve had it coming out of my nose. “My mom?” I questioned, confused.\n\n“Your actual mom. The woman who lived with your dad was not your mother.” My granddad grabbed another beer. “Lily was my daughter. I loved her so much… but when you were around six months old, she vanished.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. “My dad just imprisoned her under the porch?” I asked, starting to feel sick.\n\nGrandpa took a deep breath before setting his unopened beer down. “That’s…. something I’ve never been able to understand. Lily told you to find me? And that she loved Scrabble?”\n\n“Yeah. She kept me warm that night. I probably would’ve frozen to death if she hadn’t been there.” I was a stupid kid, even I knew that.\n\nGrandpa went dead quiet before he opened that beer and slammed the whole thing. “… Alex, Lily had been dead the whole time she was gone. When we dug her up she was bones. Experts confirmed it, and your dad confessed to what happened. They’d gotten into a fight and he threw her down the stairs. She… broke her neck.” He clenched his fists. “I knew he had something to do with her disappearance, but I never had proof until you walk into my station, covered in dirt and telling me she was under the porch.”\n\nI was floored. I couldn’t breathe. All I could do was shake my head.\n\n“But- I saw her! She was alive! She had this butterfly necklace…” I trailed off when Grandpa pulled an evidence baggie from his pocket.\n\nThere was that butterfly necklace all right. Rusty, and parts of the paint had chipped off, but I remembered it as clearly as I remembered Lily’s voice.\n\nGrandpa took a shaky breath as he pressed the bag into my hands. “… Lily loved you so much. ‘ts why she stuck around that bastard. You were her whole world. She was constantly taking pictures and sendin’ them to us in the mail. Sometimes a mother’s love can accomplish things that no human can do.”\n\nMy eyes overflowed with tears as I clutched the necklace to my chest. Choking on sobs, I leaned against Grandpa. He held me tight and I swear I felt a few of his tears land on the top of my head.\n\nAnd for just a brief moment, I swear I felt that warm love I felt that night under the porch."},"293":{"title":"Every night, my girlfriend wakes me up to tell the exact same joke.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vrdoja\/every_night_my_girlfriend_wakes_me_up_to_tell_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Point_Of_No_Return-","selftext":"Before i start, i feel like i should let something very clear: I absolutely love Ellen. We've been living together for about three years now, but have known each other our whole lives. In fact, we were childhood friends - and i know this may sound like a fairy tale to some people, but it truly felt like we were always destined to be together. Even after graduation, when we started dating other people, it only felt truly right when we were with each other. So i don't know what took me so long to ask her out, but i'm really glad i did.\n\nWe have the same taste in music, movies, and even food. We laugh at the same dumb jokes, and know exactly how to comfort each other in times of need. She's the kindest, most gentle and loving girl i ever met. We even been talking about our plans for marriage, and how we would like to have kids of our own. That's why it hurts so much how it all went terribly wrong, in just four nights.\n\nI would also like to preface that Ellen doesn't have much of a family other than me, and some very distant aunts that she never met and doesn't even know their names. I was born in a big family, with four siblings and plenty of cousins that were always visiting, and even helping out when we got in trouble. Ellen has none of that. She doesn't have any siblings, and her father was an alcoholic, abusive freak that died when she was young. Her mother was a very kind and inspiring person, that took care of the family by herself for many years. And almost a second mother to myself. So when she passed away last year, it hurt us both for a long time.\n\nBut Ellen stayed strong. She's not the type to let her feelings easily surface, so you gotta be a lot more perceptive to get what she truly feels. I used to proud myself in being capable of that. I felt like i knew her better than i knew myself. That's why this is all so strange, and frankly, terrifying.\n\nWe were sleeping in bed, and i was dreaming. I don't really remember what it was about, but for some reason i'm sure of it. Until i heard her voice, very close to my ear:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nShe was caressing my hair, gently, while sitting in bed and looking below at me.\n\nI slowly opened my eyes, groggy from sleep.\n\n''Hey... what is it, baby?''\n\nShe kept looking at me, fixated. And repeated:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nI glanced at the digital clock, on top of the dresser. *3:27 AM.* I had work in only a few hours.\n\n''What is it, Ellen?''\n\nShe paused. - ''Please answer the joke, dear. *Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\n''Fine.'' - I accepted, mostly because i was expecting some kind of surprise. Ellen wasn't the type to do what she was doing for no reason. - ''Who's there?''\n\nHer smile opened up, and she answered: ''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI kept looking at her, dumbfounded. What was that supposed to mean?\n\n''Is that it? Is that the joke?''\n\n''Yes'' - She said, laying in the couch and covering herself with a blanket. - ''Thank you for answering.''\n\n''Weirdo.'' - I answered, closing my eyes and going back to sleep.\n\nNext morning, things went as usual. I only remembered the strange conversation while i was alone in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, and wasn't even sure if it had truly happened or if it was just a weird dream. So we had our breakfast together, and she was acting normal, reading something aloud from a fashion magazine. Frankly, i wasn't paying much attention. So i took the opportunity to ask about last night.\n\nInitially, she didn't seem to know what i was talking about. Then her eyes fixated on me and the same smile from last night crossed her face, briefly. And i knew it wasn't just a dream. She told me it wasn't anything of importance, and stopped paying attention when i asked more inquisitively. And even though i shouldn't, i gave up. I had work and other matters to attend to, and just brushed off the weird event thinking it wouldn't happen again.\n\nBut the following night, i woke up to her voice.\n\n*''Knock, knock.'' -* A pause. - ''*Knock.''*\n\n''What is it now?'' - I said. - ''Ellen, what are you doing?''\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock.'' -* She repeated.\n\nThis time, she wasn't even touching me. Just sitting in bed, looking at me with that same smile. But her eyes semeed larger, and she blinked in longer intervals. I looked at the clock. Once again, *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, c'mon. What is it? I got work in a few hours, can't have the luxury of waking up in the middle of the night to answer Knock Knock jokes.''\n\n''*Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\n''This is getting creepy, you know? I'm not sure if this is some gag you've been doing, but i don't like it.''\n\n''Answer it. *Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\nI sighed, but also let a small laugh escape. It was creepy, of course, but she was also my Ellen. So it didn't bother me as much as it should.\n\n''Fine. Who the fuck is there?'' - I answered in a playful tone.\n\n''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nFor some reason, i felt a chill down in my spine. It was the same answer as before, and i still didn't get what it meant. But the way she said it, with a strange, monotone voice, contrasted well with her smile and the fact that i had no idea of what she meant by that.\n\n''What does that mean?'' - I asked. - ''I really don't get it.''\n\nShe just smiled, and went back to sleep. I felt a throb in my heart, but did the same.\n\nNext day, we talked again about what was happening. She was very evasive with my questions, and i barely got her to say anything. It was almost as if she couldn't talk about it, which was very strange, considering we talk about pretty much everything. I told her i needed to be well rested for work, something she should understand well, and wasn't liking her little gag every night. She just nodded. And i decided to not press further, as i didn't want to hurt her feelings and had work to attend to.\n\nWhen i got back home, we had dinner, watched a movie and went to bed.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI opened my eyes faster this time around. In fact, i barely got any sleep - i just knew she would do it again and kept thinking about it the whole time. Glanced at the clock: *3:27 AM.*\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI thought about ignoring her. Just pretending i was asleep and she wouldn't wake me up. So i closed my eyes slowly, hoping that she hadn't seen me opening them in the first place, and stayed quiet.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nShe continued. She didn't stop. I regulated my breathing, but she kept going.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''I'm not answering your fucking joke, Ellen. Stop it.''\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI ignored but she kept going. She had never been this insistent with anything before. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting on my nerves, and frankly, i felt scared. Why was Ellen doing this? Why every night, at the same exact time down to the minute? Why wouldn't she let me sleep until i answered her?\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI got up in a sudden movement.\n\n''God dammit, Ellen.'' - I was ready for a discussion, but when i finally glanced at her, it was as if the strength was drained from me.\n\nShe wasn't smiling. She wasn't blinking. Just staring right at me, fixated like an animal. And her mouth was moving, slowly, and she didn't stop. ''*Knock, Knock''.*\n\nI didn't know how to react, or what expression i had when i saw her but my heart skipped a beat. It was terrifying, as if her gaze froze me in place. A thousand-yard stare.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I asked, feeling as if it was the only way out of that nightmare.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door'' -* She said, weakly.\n\nEllen slowly closed her eyes and layed down. I kept staring at her while she fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep.\n\nI got up and and left. I walked downstairs and sat down at the couch in the living room, staring at the night sky outside and absorbing the quiet of the neighborhood. My heart was beating fast and it didn't slow down. I was too scared to sleep in the same room as my girlfriend, all because of a fucking Knock Knock joke. But it was unnatural. I thought about calling someone. I thought about it all being some kind of sleep-related issue, such as some type of sleep-walking. But it didn't make any sense.\n\nI felt so tired. And decided that early in the morning, i would call an old friend who's a psychologist and get the opinion of a professional. Something was wrong with Ellen.\n\nI stayed in the couch as the day rose, and once Ellen woke up, she was acting normal again. Even asked me why i wasn't in bed. I didn't answer. In fact, i didn't speak to her and simply left for work. She seemed very upset, but i wouldn't do anything about it. Once i got to work i called my friend, told him everything that was happening in as much detail as i'm describing now. He didn't seem as worried as i figured, but we agreed in making an appointment for next week. Now i just needed to convince Ellen to come with me.\n\nI received plenty of text messages from her. She seemed very worried, sad and even confused. She apologized a lot, and it broke my heart a little. I felt bad. I shouldn't have, but i answered her, and made her promise it wouldn't happen again. I also told her about the appointment, and she seemed reluctant but agreed to go with me. So we made up.\n\nThis was Ellen, after all. The girl i knew ever since i was six years old. The woman i loved and that had taken care of me for years. And as much as that strange behaviour creeped me out, she wasn't doing anything particularly frightening, or even dangerous. So for a brief while, i convinced myself i should give her another chance.\n\nWhen i returned home from work, we stayed together. She even prepared my favorite meal. Ellen was acting as gentle and caring as i always remembered, and i slept with her in our bedroom, even though i was still a bit reluctant.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI couldn't believe it. She promised me she wouldn't.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI gazed at the clock. *3:27 AM.* Always.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI was laying on my stomach and i couldn't see her face. In fact, i didn't even bother to look at her. I was feeling more sad than scared, at that point. Sad that she had broken her word.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I answered, determined to just go back to sleep.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI stayed quiet and closed my eyes. I just hoped i would be able to handle it until the appointment next week.\n\nTo my surprise, i was actually able to sleep. Probably because i hadn't been able to rest since last night. The following morning, i went back to not saying anything to Ellen, only very limited responses. I was expecting her to act same as yesterday, trying to apologize, but she didn't. Mostly she didn't say anything, almost as if she had accepted it. She also looked tired, or at least a bit weak.\n\nI went to work, but i couldn't stop thinking about her. Didn't receive any messages either. Once i got back, we had the most silent dinner i ever had in my life. And she barely ate anything.\n\nI decided to let her have the bedroom and sleep on the couch. I wasn't sure if it would stop her, but held on to the hope that she wouldn't go downstairs only to tell me the same Knock Knock joke again. I covered myself with a blanket, shaked off that uneasy feeling and tried to sleep.\n\nI had a deep sleep, without dreams. Felt like i was lost in darkness. Then i heard breathing.\n\nOpened my eyes to see Ellen, standing above me, looking at me with big, fixated eyes and dilated pupils that didn't seem to belong in such a completly neutral expression. Watching me sleep.\n\nI almost screamed in terror. Jumped out of the couch, and her eyes followed me as i stumbled through the dark room, creating distance between us. For a moment i was able to glance at the clock above the table: *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, what are you doing?!'' - I asked, desperate. But she didn't move.\n\nIn fact, she didn't say anything. Just stared at me, as if i was made of glass and she could see right through me.\n\nThen i heard a knock on the front door.\n\nInstinctively, i looked in that direction. It was followed by another knock. And another. Someone almost pounding at the door.\n\nI glanced back at Ellen, and she was still staring at me. Slowly, i got closer to the door and she didn't move. The pounding continued.\n\n''Who's there?!'' - I screamed.\n\nIt stopped. And then, i heard a voice.\n\n''John? John, can you hear me? Open the door, please! John, please open the door!''\n\nI froze in place. The voice kept calling me. But i couldn't believe it. It was Ellen's voice, coming from the other side of the door. But it couldn't be.\n\n''I beg you, John! Open the door, it's serious! She's not me, i swear! She's not me!''\n\nSlowly i turned my head to look at Ellen, standing in front of the couch. She was looking at me, the same fixated eyes and a terrible, wide grin across her face.\n\nThe pounding continued. ''John, open the door! Please, you have to trust me!''\n\nI stayed still, not knowing what to do. And i don't remember what happened after that.\n\nI just woke up in my bedroom. The digital clock indicates it's *4:21 AM.* Ellen isn't by my side, i'm completly alone. I'm trembling, uncontrollably and i don't know what's going on. I don't remember what happened after i saw her terrible grim. I don't know if i opened the door.\n\nI tried to look for my phone, see if i could call the police, or at least someone that i know. But i left it downstairs. All i have is Ellen's laptop, and it's where i'm writing this right now, to get advice. Because i can't go downstairs. The corridor is dark, very dark, almost as if the shadows were leaning into the room. And i can hear a faint, scratching sound coming from below.\n\nWhat should i do?"},"294":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 4!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"Part 1: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 3: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nHey guys! I'm back from my training op, and I have a lot of really interesting stories to share with you. I've got enough that I'm going to break them up into two parts, this being the first. I'd love to put them all in one entry, but I just haven't had a chance to write them all down yet.\nI didn't have anything too crazy happen while I was out there, but we did have one incident with a rookie that I found relevant. Since I'm sure you guys have been waiting for these, I'll just get right into the stories. I'll assign each batch of stories to the person who told them to me.\n\n**K.D:** \nK. D is a vet who's been an SAR officer for about fifteen years. She specializes in high elevation mountain rescues, and is widely considered one of the best in her field. She was one of the more enthusiastic storytellers, and since we were together a fair amount during exercises, she ended up telling me about four that really stuck with me.\n\n* The first she told me in response to my asking about her most traumatic calls. She shook her head and told me that really bad calls happen more frequently on the mountain, since the potential for nasty accidents is higher. \nAbout five years ago, one of the parks she worked at had a string of disappearances. It was a bad year, she said, one of the worst on record as far as weather went. They were getting about a foot of new snow every couple of days, and there were a few avalanches that killed some climbers. They'd warned people about staying on the mapped areas, but of course there's always those who don't listen.\nIn one particularly nasty case, an entire family got wiped out because the father decided he knew better than the officials, and he took them out into an area that wasn't safe. They were snowshoeing, and as best K.D could figure, they'd walked onto a shelf of snow that looked solid, but actually wasn't. It gave way, and this family went ass over teakettle almost three hundred feet down a slope. They landed on the rocks at the bottom, and the parents died instantly. One of the kids did as well, but the other two survived. One had a broken leg and fractured ribs, the other was almost unharmed save for some bruising and a sprained ankle. The uninjured child left his sibling behind and set out to find help. \nK.D said the kid didn't make it more than half a mile before a storm overtook him. Kid stopped to try and get warm, or maybe just to rest, and ended up freezing to death. They ended up finding the family with the help of some witnesses who saw them heading out into the wilderness, and she was the one to find the kid who'd frozen to death looking for help. She said it had started to snow, just enough to obscure long-distance vision, but not enough to make searching impossible. She saw a figure sitting in the snow up ahead, and she got to it as quickly as possible. She described, in detail, how as she got closer, she realized first that it was a child, second that they were deceased, and third that they had frozen in one of the most pitiful positions she's ever found a corpse in.\nThe kid was sitting upright, with his knees tucked up against his chest. His arms were curled around them, and his head was tucked up in his coat. When she moved the coat to look at his face, she saw that he'd died crying. His face was twisted, and the tears were frozen on his cheeks. She said it was painfully obvious that the kid was terrified when he succumbed to hypothermia, and as a mother, it broke her heart. She told me, repeatedly, that she hopes the father is burning in hell as we speak. \n\n* The other traumatic story she told me that stood out, in my mind, was one that happened when she was a rookie. Her team got a report of an experienced climber who hadn't come home the previous day. His wife was convinced that something bad had happened, because he'd never failed to come home on time. They went out looking for him, and had to climb what sounded like some very technically challenging parts of the mountain. They got to a relatively flat area, and K.D started seeing blood in the snow. She followed the trail, and as she went, she started seeing little bits of tissue. She wasn't sure exactly what body part it had come from, but the farther she followed it, the more there was. She follows this blood-and-tissue trail to a sheltered area under a cliff face, and she finds the climber. She said there was so much blood, more than she'd ever seen before. He was lying face down, one arm stretched in front of him, as if he'd died crawling. She looks closer, and sees that he's been partially disemboweled, which is where the tissue she'd seen had come from. The guy has an ice pick tucked into a hip holster, and it's covered in blood. Of course, they'll never be sure exactly what happened, but she said as best she can figure, this is what went down:\nThe guy had been attempting to climb up to the next area, and had been using his ice ax to ascend. He'd probably hit a loose patch, and had fallen. On the way down, or possibly when he landed, he'd gotten impaled by the ax, and it had disemboweled him. He'd drug himself along, tearing pieces of himself out as he went, and had died under the cliff face. She isn't terribly bothered by gore, but I guess a few of the guys who came to help her remove the body threw up when they turned him over and a good portion of his intestines spilled out.\n\n* I mentioned to her that I was interested in hearing about any experiences she had with people completely disappearing. Her eyes light up, and she leans in close to me. \n'Wanna hear a real doozy?' She asks. \nShe tells me about how, when she first started, there was a case that got a lot of attention in the media. A family had been out berry picking in an area of the forest very close to the entrance of the park. They had two little boys, both under the age of five, and at some point during the day, one of them vanishes. There's an absolutely massive search, and they find absolutely nothing. It's another of those cases where it's like the kid was never there in the first place. The dogs just sit down and don't pick up on anything, no trace of the kid is found. The search goes on for about two months, but is eventually called off.\nFast forward to six months later. The family comes back to place flowers at a memorial that's been set up there for the kid. They bring their other son. While they're placing the flowers, they lose sight of the kid for about three seconds, and in that span of time he vanishes into thin air. Now obviously, the parents are beyond devastated. It's awful enough to lose one child, but to lose two is beyond imagining. The search is huge, one of the largest in state history. There are about three hundred volunteers combing every inch of this park, looking for the kid. But again, there's no trace of him. The search goes on for about a week, with people looking miles from the part of the park he vanished from.\nAnd then, almost two weeks later, a volunteer almost fifteen miles from the designated search area radios in that he's found the kid. They assumed that the kid was dead, but the volunteer says he's not only alive, he's in good shape. K.D and her team go out to recover the kid, and when they get there, she can't believe that this is the kid that's been missing. His clothes are clean, there's no dirt on him anywhere, and he doesn't appear traumatized. The volunteer says he found the kid sitting on a log, playing with a little twig bundle that's bound together with some old rope. K.D asks him where he's been, who he was with for those two weeks, and the kid tells her that he's been with 'the fuzzy man'. Now K.D firmly believes in Bigfoot, so she gets all excited and asks what he means by fuzzy. Was he hairy? But the kid says no, he wasn't hairy. He was a 'fuzzy man', and he describes a man that's blurry, 'like when you close your eyes but not all the way closed.' He says the man came out of the trees and took the kid with him deep into the woods. The kid says he slept in a hollow tree, and the fuzzy man gave him berries to eat. K.D asks if the man was mean, if he scared the kid, and the kid says 'no, he wasn't scary. but i didn't like how he didn't have eyes.'\nK.D says they get the kid back to headquarters, and a cop takes him into town to talk to him more about what happened. She's friends with the cop that talked to him, and she said the kid described being kept in this tree by the fuzzy man, and given berries whenever he was hungry. He was allowed to wander around a very specific clearing, but when he tried to go further, the fuzzy man would 'get mad and yell real loud even though he didn't have a mouth'. When the kid got scared at night, the fuzzy man 'made it go brighter' and gave him the twig bundle. He said the fuzzy man was going to keep him, but he had to let him go because the kid wasn't 'the right kind.' He either can't or won't elaborate more on that. The cops are just sort of left scratching their heads, and the search for his brother is renewed with no results. The kid has no idea where his brother might be, and they never find him.\n\n* The last story that K.D told me was of something that happened to her when she got separated from her training group when she was a rookie. They were learning the basics of high elevation belaying on a well-mapped side of the mountain, and she had to use the bathroom. She went off about fifty yards from the group during a meal break, and did her business. I'll tell the rest exactly as she told it to me'\n'So I go to take a piss, and once I'm done, I start going back to the group. But I've only gotten about five feet when I realize that I have no idea where I am. And this wasn't a 'oh, I got turned around' lost. I mean I had literally no fucking clue where I was. If you'd asked me, I don't even think I'd have been able to tell you what state we were in. It was sort of how I imagine people with amnesia feel, you know? You're completely lost, and you have no idea what to do. So I stood there for a while, just trying to figure out where the fuck I was and what I was supposed to do. But the longer I stand there, the more confused and turned around I get, so I started walking. As I recall, I just picked a random direction and went for it. And as I'm walking, it's just getting worse and worse to the point where I have no concept of why I'm on the mountain in the first place. I'm just trudging through the snow, and then I start hearing this voice. It's kind of inside my head, almost. Like if a frog could talk, all low and croaky. And it's telling me over and over 'it's okay, it's okay, you just need to find something to eat. Find something to eat and you'll be okay, just keep walking and find something to eat. Eat. Eat.' So I start looking around for anything that I can eat, and I swear to god I've never felt that hungry in my whole life. It was bottomless, and I think I'd have eaten just about anything you put in front of me right then. I had no concept of time, so I had no idea how long I'd been out when I hear an actual voice coming toward me. I go toward it and see one of the other SARs, and he looks fucking terrified. He's running toward me, asking if I'm okay and what the hell I'm doing out here. \nAnd the scary thing was, as he's running toward me, I kind of see myself reaching into my belt for my hunting knife. I'm not even really thinking about what I'm doing, but what I am thinking is that I have to eat. If I don't eat, I'll never be okay again, so I just have to eat. He sees me doing that and he backs off right away. He yells at me to put my knife away, that he's not gonna hurt me, and that kind of snaps me back. All of a sudden, I know exactly where I am, and I put the knife away. I run to him and ask him how long I've been gone, thinking he'll tell me I've been gone for half an hour or so. But he tells me I've been gone for two fucking days. I've gone over two peaks and ended up almost on the other side of the mountain, and if I'd kept going, I would have ended up wandering into about three hundred miles of wilderness. They'd never have found me. He can't believe I'm not dead, and of course I don't know what the fuck to think. To me, no time has passed at all. I don't say anything, I just go back with him to a rendezvous point and I'm taken back to HQ  to be airlifted to the hospital. When I get there, they do all kinds of tests, and try to figure out what happened. As best they can guess, I had some kind of weird fugue state, which is kind of like amnesia, or a weird seizure that knocked my brain out of whack. But the truth is that we really don't know. It's never happened again, but I'll tell you, ever since then I never go out there alone. People rag on me for making them come with me when I have to leave the group, but I just tell 'em that listening to me piss in the snow is better than losing me for two fucking days on a freezing mountain.'\n\n**EW:**\nThe next person I talked to was E.W, a former trainer who now works as an EMT. He still comes to ops like this to help out, but doesn't work full-time for us anymore. He specialized in finding lost kids, he just seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to knowing where they'd gone. He's a legend among the more senior vets, but he gets embarrassed if you compliment him on his work. He sat down with me at dinner one evening, and we ended up swapping stories. Most of them were just casual, but when we got on the subject of our weirder calls, I mentioned that I'd had a buddy who'd gone up a set of stairs. He got kind of quiet and asked me if I'd heard of a little boy who'd disappeared from his park a few years back. I hadn't, so he told me this story.\n\n* They were out looking for this eleven-year-old boy, Joey, who'd gone missing near a river. Of course, the first thought was that he'd fallen in and drowned, but when they brought dogs out, they led SAR officers away from the river and up into a very densely forested area. When we do searches for people, we search in a grid pattern, and we search every 'box' of the grid incredibly thoroughly. What E.W's team noticed right away was that a very strange pattern was emerging. Dogs in alternating boxes were picking up Joey's scent, but losing it when they overlapped with another box. If you think of a checkerboard, Joey's scent was being picked up in random black squares, but never in red. This, of course, didn't make any sense, because how could the kid bounce from area to area without leaving a scent in each place he passed? E.W and his partner pass into a new box of the grid, and E.W notices a set of stairs about fifty yards away. He tells his partner that they need to go check near it, but his partner flat-out refuses. He tells E.W that he's made it a point never to go near any stairs he sees, and that while it may be routine, he's not to pretend that it's normal. He tells E.W that he'll wait in sight while E.W checks. E.W says he was irritated, but he felt for the guy, and didn't push him on the subject. \n'I walked over to the stairs. They were small, kind of like stairs into a basement. I don't really feel strongly one way or the other about them, the stairs I mean, so I wasn't scared or anything. I guess I'm like everyone else, and I just prefer not to think about them too much.\n'Anyway, I went over and I could see that there was something lying on the bottom step, sort of curled up. My hear sinks, because of course you always hope for the best. And we were confident that we'd find this kid alive, because he'd only been missing for a few hours. But I knew right away that it was him, and that he was dead. He was curled up in a little ball on the step, holding his stomach. It looked like he'd been in horrible pain when he died, but I didn't see any blood, except some on his lips and chin. I radioed in that I'd found him, and we got his body back to command. That poor family, they were devastated. The parents couldn't understand how he'd be dead, 'cause he'd only been gone for such a short amount of time. And on top of that we didn't have any obvious cause of death, which just made it worse. I figured he'd probably eaten something poisonous, since he was holding his stomach when I found him, but I didn't want to guess. It's hard enough to hear that your kid is dead, let alone have some stupid SAR guy guessing about what happened. They took him away, and I went home and tried not to think about it. I hate finding dead kids, man. I loved this job but it's one of the reasons I left. I've got two daughters, and the thought of losing them that way just...' \nHe choked up a little here. I'm not great with emotional stuff like that, and it's always sort of awkward to see a grown man cry, so I didn't really know what to do. He pulled himself together eventually, though, and he kept going.\n'We don't always hear back from the coroners about cause of death. It's not really our job to know, I guess, and sometimes if they think it's foul play they won't tell us because of legal bullshit. But I've got a friend who works for the sheriff's department, and he'll usually pass along any interesting info if I ask. In this case, though, I actually got a call from him about a week later. He asks if I remember the kid, and of course I do, and he says some seriously weird shit is going on. He tells me, 'E.W, man, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but the coroner has no idea what happened to this kid. He's never seen anything like it.' My friend goes on to tell me that when the coroner opened the kid up, he couldn't even believe what he was seeing. The kid's organs were like swiss cheese. Quarter-sized holes were punched clean through just about every single organ this kid had, aside from his heart and lungs. But his colon, his stomach, his kidneys and even one of his testicles, were full of these clean holes. My friend said the coroner described it as if someone had taken a hole-punch and punched holes out of everything, they were so neat. But the kid didn't have a scratch on him, no entry or exit wounds. The closest anyone there had ever seen like it was a guy who'd filled himself full of buckshot a year or so back while cleaning his rifle. No one had a clue what could possibly have caused it. My friend asked me if I'd ever heard of anything like it, or if we'd had similar cases in the past. But I'd never even heard of something like that, and I told him I wasn't going to be of any help to him. As far as I know, the coroner determined the cause of death as something like 'massive internal bleeding', but no one knows what really happened.\nI've never been able to forget that kid. I have nightmares about it sometimes. I don't let my kids go into the woods alone, and when we go together I never let them out of my sight. I used to love it out here. But that case, and a couple others, just sort of ruined it for me.'\nDinner was over, so we started to clean up and go back to our cabins. Before we went our separate ways, he put his hand on my shoulder and looked at me really close. He tells me that there's bad things out here. Things that don't care if we have families or lives, or that we can think and feel. He tells me to be careful, and he walks away. I didn't a chance to talk with him again, but that story stuck with me.\n\n**PB:**\nBy pure coincidence, I got to talk to another vet, P.B who's been in the SAR field for years. We were partnered on a grid sweep during a training exercise, and we were chatting casually about how we liked the job, what kinds of things we'd seen, and the like. At one point, we passed an old set of stairs, though these were probably from an old fire lookout, given the area that we were in. I sort of casually mentioned that I was curious about the stairs, and that I wished I knew more about them. He got kind of quiet and looked like he wanted to tell me something, but wasn't sure if he should. Finally, he told me to turn my radio off. Obviously this is something we are never, ever supposed to do, but I did it, and he did the same. \n\n* About seven years ago, he tells me, he was out on a call with a rookie. They were in an area of the park that's had a lot of strange reports and events. Disappearances, stories about lights in the forest, odd noises, things like that. The rookie was totally spooked, kept going on and on about 'things out in the woods'. According to P.B:\n'The guy wouldn't stop talking about 'the Goatman'. Just on and on, 'Goatman' this and 'Goatman' that. Finally, I told him that there was plenty else to be afraid of out here that was very real, and that he'd better get over this thing with the Goatman. The rookie wanted to know what kinds of things I was talking about, and I just told him to shut up and walk. We crested a little ridge and there was a staircase about ten yards ahead. The rookie stops dead in his tracks and just stands there looking at them. I tell him, 'See? That's something you should be afraid of.' The rookie asks me what the hell these are doing out here, and for some reason, I just open up and tell him the truth. Or what I've been told is the truth. I could have gotten in a lot of trouble for doing what I did, and I could get in a lot of trouble for repeating it to you. But you're a nice kid, and I want you to stop looking into this. Quit while you're ahead. So I'll tell you what I know, under the condition that you never breathe a word of this to the supes.'\nI told him I wouldn't say a word, and he double-checks that our radios are off.\n'When I first started out, we were a little less tight-lipped about them, and other things that happen out here. We warned people before they were even hired that there was weird shit going on. I guess the Forest Service was tired of having such a massive turnover rate, and they wanted people to know what they were getting into. So they started having people sign these agreements that they wouldn't go to the media about what they were going to see. The FS didn't want to scare people away, so the last thing they needed were spooked rookies running off to the media with stories of ghosts and haunted stairs. But eventually, they found that the agreements weren't necessary. People not only didn't want to talk about what they saw, they wouldn't. A few times, media tried to talk to people when kids or hikers would disappear, and no one would say a word. I can't really explain it. I guess we just... don't really want to admit anything is wrong. This is our job, to be out in the woods every single day. We don't need to be spooked, and the best way to avoid that is to pretend like everything's okay. So I'll tell you everything I can think of, and after that, I'm done talking about it for good. And I expect you not to bring it up around me, ever.\n'The stairs have been out here as long as the parks have existed. We have records going back decades describing them. Sometimes people go up them, and nothing happens. Other times... Look, I really don't like talking about this, but sometimes, really bad shit happens. I saw one guy get his hand sliced clean off when he got to the top step. He reached out to touch a tree branch, and it happened so fast. One second his hand was there, and the next it was gone. Completely clean wound. We didn't find his hand, and the guy almost died. Another time, a woman touched one of the stairs, and a blood vessel in her brain exploded. Literally exploded, like a water balloon. She sort of stumbled down and came over to me, and all she got out was 'I think something is wrong with me.' She dropped like a sack of flour, dead before she hit the ground. I'll never forget the way the blood leaked into the inside of her eye. Before she died, I watched it turn red. I watched it happen and there wasn't a single thing I could do to help.\n'We warn people not to go anywhere near them but there's always at least one idiot who does. And even if nothing happens to them, something bad always happens. Kids go missing as we're on their trail. Someone dies the next day, cut in half in a completely safe part of the park. I don't know why, but something bad always happens. I don't know exactly why they're out here, but it doesn't matter. They're here, and if we were smart, we'd tell our new officers exactly what they're capable of.'\nWe were both quiet for a little while. I was afraid to talk because I wasn't sure if he was done. He looked like he wanted to say something else. Finally he spoke up again.\n'Have you ever noticed how you can't find the same ones twice?'\nI nodded, expecting him to continue. But he just stayed quiet, walking alongside me, and eventually he started a story about the biggest deer he'd ever seen in the park. I didn't bring up the subject again, and I didn't press him for any more stories. He dropped out of the op the next day. Apparently he left before the sun came up; he said he was sick. None of us have heard from him since he left.\n\nI'm going to stop here for the time being. I'll try and post the next part in the coming days, but what with it being the end of summer, things are pretty busy here. Thanks for the continued interest, guys, you've really awakened this curiosity in me that I didn't know I had!\n\n**EDIT**: Part Five is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3kd90k\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/"},"295":{"title":"I can see people's auras... and it's a curse.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/6xer5n\/i_can_see_peoples_auras_and_its_a_curse\/","flair":null,"author":"A10A10A10","selftext":"Yes, I can see people’s auras. \n\nAnd I hate saying it so bluntly.  It makes me sound like some hack psychic who fakes the ability as a means of exploitation and a paycheck.  I’ve never made money from my ability. I’ve never taken advantage of it.  And, until now, I’ve never spoken of it to anybody.\n\nBut I really do see them, and I’m starting to view it as more of a curse.  I have a reason for typing this out and I assure you, there isn’t a happy ending.   \n\nFor me, it’s quite simple.  I see a faint light surrounding people.  Everyone.  And in that light, I can see their *morality*.  The brighter and more translucent the light is, the better the person.  The darker and opaquer, the worse.  Dim and partly translucent are morally ambiguous.   To simplify things, those are the three ways I describe them.  Dark equals evil.   Bright equals good.  Dim equals somewhere in between.  It’s strange, I’ve always viewed the people with grey\/dim auras as… arbiters.  Mediators.  The people in between, who aren’t one or the other, and will always have difficult decisions to make.\n\nI was a child when I first became aware of my gift.  It didn’t take long to figure out that the brighter auras were kinder to me and selfless.  While both of my parents are good people, my father’s aura was quite a bit brighter than my mothers.  As a result, he was always far more patient and understanding with me.   It was clear to see that my teachers and fellow students with brighter auras were usually friendlier and more compassionate.  The dark auras were the stereotypical fighters, lunch money stealers, and bullies.  I would say I was around 8 years old when I fully figured out that I have a gift that most people don’t have.  That possibly *nobody* else has.\n\nI’ve read some of the ‘new age’ websites and alternative medicine articles that give their take on aura reading.  While I believe that the vast majority of it is bullshit, I expect there must be at least SOME other people out there with my ability.  So I don’t want to completely dismiss those people as an outright hoax.  It’s just that, for me, it doesn’t work anything like the way those websites describe.  I’ve visited numerous aura readers and psychics.  Most of them have dim or dark auras themselves, and I’m certain they don’t really hold this power.  I’m not saying all “psychics” are terrible people.  I’ve visited a few who had very bright auras.  They were unable to convince me that they really have psychic powers, but they at the very least used their deception to try and help people.  \n\nYou need to understand… I’m going to end this entry by sharing a terrifying event that is happening to me.  But before I get to that, I think there are a few more things I need to explain.  I imagine many of you are curious as to what type of aura is the most common.  I’m happy to tell you that the majority of people are somewhere between dim and bright.  I see very few dark auras.  This isn’t scientific, and I haven’t traveled the world plotting out charts and graphs, but I’d estimate around 60% of people are bright-ish.  Around 25% dim-ish.  Leaving just around 15% dark-ish.  Again, these are just estimates.  What’s the precise difference between, say, bright and dim?  I have no idea.  But rest assured, there is far more “bright” in the world than “dark”.\n\nThe next thing I’d like to discuss is children.  I can see a person’s aura right from birth, and I’ve never encountered an aura changing as someone ages.  I’m not sure what this means for the whole nature vs nurture debate.  And I’m not saying that everyone with a dark aura always behaves terribly, or vice versa.  A person with a bright aura might be born in horrible conditions, acquire a drug problem, and then resort to thievery to feed their addiction.  I think the difference is this… a bright aura thief with a horrible upbringing may rob someone, but they would never intentionally hurt someone in the process.  A dark aura thief would kill someone if they could get away with it without even a second thought.  \n\nAnother interesting note…  I find the ratio between bright\/dim\/dark to be similar across pretty much all human activities.  Whether I’m at a church or a death metal concert, it always seems to be around that same 60%-25%-15% ratio.  I once visited a federal prison and was shocked to see that at least half of the prisoners had bright auras.  I had to be at the prison in person to see this because I can’t see auras on photographs, television shows, movies, or even in mirrors.  I can only see auras in the real world.  Another strange thing… I can’t even see my own aura.   I assume and hope I would be on the brighter spectrum… but I can’t see it.\n\nThe brightest person I ever saw worked as a social worker.  She shone so bright that it was difficult for me to even look at her.  Based on the way people acted in her presence, I think that almost everyone around her could sense her brightness in a subconscious way.  Everyone loved her. She had donated a kidney to someone she barely even knew.  She had a special needs adopted child.  Most of the money she earned was donated to various charities.  And that’s only the little that I knew of her.  This woman shined so brightly that she scared me.  It was scary that someone could be so good.\n\nBut it wasn’t nearly as scary as the darkest person I ever saw.  I was 20 years old at the time, leaving a club downtown at 2 am.  A man quietly walked down the street.  I didn’t see him at first, but I noticed the light dimming around me.  This man was so dark that he partly absorbed the light around him.  I looked at him long and hard.  He looked desperate, cruel, and callous.  When he looked up and locked eyes with me, it made me fall back.  He smirked, as though he knew what I could see.  I saw his face up close.  I would never forget it.  And I recognized it when I saw his mugshot a few weeks later in the newspaper.  He had murdered his ex-wife and two children in cold blood.  \n\nI think I need to get to it now.  The reason why I’m writing this out.  \n\nI fell in love a year ago.  She didn’t shine anywhere near as bright as what I’ve seen before, but she most assuredly wasn’t dark or even dim.  She was beautiful.  Her sense of humor, her wit, her.. everything.  She was my dream woman.  And I’ve never told her anything at all about the auras I see.  I could go into far more about her but this isn’t a love story.  What’s important is this:  We fell in love.  She got pregnant.  We got married.  We were happy.  We were *so* happy.\n\nI remember hearing the buzz of my phone two mornings ago.  I remember my excitement when I saw “It’s happening.  Come to the hospital.”  I remember my frustration when I got stuck in traffic.  I remember how long it took to find a parking spot.  I remember shouting at a nurse “WHAT ROOM IS MY WIFE IN.”  I remember bursting through a door and seeing the smile on my wife’s face.  I remember seeing the doctor, his light shining so bright, as he told me “Congratulations, it’s a boy.”\n\nThe doctor held him up to me.  \n\nAnd all the light in the room dissipated.  \n\n“No, this can’t be.”  I remember saying.    The doctor put him in my arms.  \n\nThe darkness around my son was so absolute that I could barely even see him.  He was a void.  He was so dark that the world barely even existed around him.  It was like nothing I’d ever experienced.  I started weeping.  I think my wife and the doctor thought they were tears of joy.  But they weren’t.  Lord knows they weren’t.\n\nI think back to the dark outline around that man that murdered his family.  It was up to that point the darkest I’d ever seen.  But the darkness around my son was 100 times worse.  A *thousand* times worse.  And what could possibly be a thousand times worse than murdering your entire family?\n\nIt’s been two days.  We’re home now.  My son’s darkness is so extreme that it dims the hallway leading to his room.  My wife knows something is wrong.  I think she suspects I’m having regrets about having children at all.  If only she knew…\n\nWhat do I do?  He’s my son.  Just 20 minutes ago I stood above him, holding a pillow over his face.  But I couldn’t do it.  Not yet anyway.  A man who could murder his two-day old baby boy: what color would his aura be? \n\nAnd here’s the thought that keeps going through my mind as I sit here alone.  The fathers of our worst.  The Adolf Hitler’s.  Joseph Stalin’s.  Timothy McVeigh’s. If their fathers knew what they would become, would they murder them in the cradle?  Would they have the strength to hold down the pillow as long as it takes?\n\nI can see the door of my son’s room from my office.  The hallway seems to be growing darker.  I look down at my hands as I type this.  Maybe I’m going crazy, but there seems to be an aura around my hands and arms now.  It’s gray.  It’s dim.  Maybe it’s always been dim.  \n\nI’m looking down at the pillow beside me.    The grayish dim outline around my hands more apparent than ever. Maybe it’s time.  Maybe this is why I have this gift.  It all comes down to right now.  \n\nMaybe it’s time.\n\nI think it’s time.\n"},"296":{"title":"The James Webb Telescope discovered something terrifying in deep space","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vuhfl9\/the_james_webb_telescope_discovered_something\/","flair":null,"author":"Phonecloth","selftext":"I work for NASA as an astronomer, and there are certain things we keep hidden from the public. No, the Earth isn't flat, and aliens don't control the government. Fuck, I wish those were the case, as the truth is much, much worse.\n\nIn 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope saw a star disappear. It didn't go supernova, or die naturally, it simply went dark, over the span of a few minutes. This star was already too faint to see with the naked eye, and ground-based telescopes had trouble picking it out from among the surrounding stars, so the event wasn't widely known to the public. At the time, we thought the most likely explanation was that a cloud of interstellar dust had drifted between Earth and the star, occluding it from view. It was noted and mostly forgotten about.\n\nIn 2007, two more stars vanished. Due to the circumstances of this event, this was much more concerning. The two stars in question were part of a binary system, orbiting each other at a fairly close distance. If a cloud of interstellar dust was the culprit again, they would have both seemed to disappear simultaneously, or very close to it. Instead, both stars faded individually over a period of minutes, separated by a span of about 8 hours. This binary system was also about 15 light-years closer to Earth than the star that had previously disappeared in 1993.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing millions of Hubble images, two more stars were identified which had 'gone out', in the years 1995 and 2002. These were all in the same stellar neighborhood, only a handful of light-years from each other. The only conclusion we could draw was that some unknown influence, traveling close to the speed of light, was shrouding (or destroying) these stars. Unfortunately, the Hubble wasn't sensitive enough to tell us any more than that.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope first came online a few months ago. Although official channels will tell you that it's still undergoing testing, we have been actively collecting data since early February. One of the first things we did was to aim the telescope at the regions of space occupied by the vanished stars. If they were being blocked by dust clouds (a hope some of us still held onto), the increased sensitivity of the JWST may have been able to see through them and confirm that the stars were still there. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The first 3 stars that had disappeared were still completely dark. Gravitational wave detectors, though, soon found something odd. In all cases, not only were the stellar masses still present, but the amount of mass had actually increased. More sensitive observations had also detected a type of 'string', or 'web' stretching through space connecting these now-invisible stars.\n\nWhen we trained the telescope on the binary system that had vanished in 2007, which was the nearest point at which this phenomenon had so far been observed, there was finally enough ambient EM spectrum radiation left to try a mass spectrometer reading. If you're not aware, mass spectrometry is an incredibly useful process, where by measuring the patterns of light wavelengths emitted or reflected by an object, we can learn tons of useful information, such as its temperature, speed and direction of movement, and chemical composition. The readings we got from the binary stars didn't make any sense, though. First of all, they were cold - almost as cold as the surrounding interstellar medium. Whatever had happened to these stars had snuffed them out completely, or somehow prevented their light from escaping. What was truly puzzling, however, were the emission lines returned by the mass spectrometer. Several familiar elements, such as Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium were identified, but these were few and far between. Most of the readings didn't correspond to any known chemical elements, and even seemed to defy what we knew about the physics of light, matter, and chemistry. This massive, star-spanning structure was primarily composed of materials that we didn't even have names for, and may not even have been matter as we understand it.\n\nSpeculation ran rampant. Obviously, such a thing couldn't be a natural phenomenon. Finally, we had proof of extraterrestrial life! But what was this thing we had discovered, and for what purpose was it being built? The leading hypothesis was that we were looking at a series of Dyson Shells - massive solar collectors built to completely envelop stars, in order to capture 100% of their energy output. Such a concept had been envisioned in the early 20th century, as a potential source of energy for an interstellar civilization. Ever since then, the idea had found its way into popular science fiction. The construction of these massive structures had actually been theorized to be one of the first signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life that we may someday detect. It seemed that day was today.\n\nThe theory still didn't explain everything, though. First of all, there was the impossible speed with which the stars were covered. Constructing a Dyson shell from scratch in a matter of minutes was beyond even the wildest speculations of scientists and sci-fi writers. Then there were the mysterious 'filaments' that connected the shells over distances of light-years. No one had any idea what purpose these could serve, or how they could even be built.\n\nEveryone at NASA was fascinated by this mystery. In hindsight, we may have been better off if we had never discovered the truth.\n\nLess than a month ago, the JWST detected a series of unusual energy bursts emanating from interstellar space. These were occurring at the very edge of a star system approximately 12 light-years from the binary system that vanished in 2007. As we focused the telescope on this system, we soon determined that these were not natural phenomena either. The energy signatures, which were still flashing intermittently, matched what would be expected from thermonuclear and antimatter - based explosions, along with several other types of energies that we couldn't identify. These explosions, although still not visible to the naked eye on Earth from that distance, were absolutely tremendous in magnitude - easily billions of times more powerful than any nuke that humanity could conceivably build.  \n\n\nAfter experimenting with the telescope's settings, we were able to get a clearer picture of what was going on: The tip of one of the interstellar 'filaments' that linked the Dyson system was passing through the Oort Cloud of the distant star system, approaching its sun. And whoever lived there was fighting back. Their weapons were able to slow the thing's advance, shattering, breaking off, and vaporizing planet-sized chunks of the object, but it seemed to be rebuilding itself almost as fast as it was being destroyed. After less than a week, the explosions stopped. It seems that they had run out of ammunition. In the void between stars, we knew that these things traveled at nearly the speed of light, but as we watched it approach the inner star system, its pace slowed as it swelled in size, preparing to devour the system's star.\n\nWe quickly trained the telescope's mirrors on the doomed sun. We were about to watch whatever this thing was blot out another star, but in real time. We all held our breath as we watched the projected image of the main sequence star, slightly larger than our own sun. At first, nothing seemed to be happening, but soon a small shadow appeared on the edge of the luminous orb, soon followed by another shadow, and then a third. The shadows began to converge, forming a strange yet somehow familiar pattern as they blocked out the star's light.\n\n\"What... are those?\" One of my colleagues gasped. \"They almost look like...\" she paused, as if afraid to say the next word for fear of ridicule. I, however, had no such hesitancy.\n\n\"Leaves,\" I said, my voice monotone. The situation was far too incredible to express any emotional reaction, even that of pure shock. \"They look like leaves.\"\n\nWe watched as, over a period of minutes, a web of shadowy outlines, matching the familiar shapes of oblong leaves and thin vines, proceeded to blot out the remaining light from the distant star.\n\nBy that point, everyone in the room had realized the truth. The phenomenon we had been tracking for so many years wasn't some hyper-advanced alien megastructure. Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium, some of the few familiar elements we had detected? They were all components of chlorophyll.\n\nIt was a plant. An enormous plant that spanned across light-years. And, much like terrestrial plants, it sought out light to fuel itself. The filaments connecting the stars across interstellar space were stems - branches. It would grow in the direction of the nearest stars it sensed, completely enveloping them and then moving on. Any life inhabiting planets orbiting those stars would be left to freeze to death, or perhaps even worse, it was possible that the plant would devour those planets to add to its mass as well. \n\nEveryone was silent as the telescope continued to gather data. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, a young astronomer spoke up from the far end of the room, addressing our supervisor.\n\n\"Sir, we've begun to detect the formation of another tendril, leaving the system. Its vector is...\" he gulped. He didn't need to say any more, but he did anyway. \"It's heading directly for our sun.\"\n\n\"How much time do we have?\" the supervisor replied grimly.\n\n\"Judging by the time lag, distance, relativistic properties, and previously observed speeds of this... thing, I'd estimate no more than twenty-seven years, sir.\"\n\nTwenty-seven years. We had just watched this galactic weed overwhelm a civilization that was, at the very least, thousands of years ahead of us technologically, and we had less than three decades.\n\nI'll probably be found and silenced for posting this. But I don't care. I have to tell someone. I can't keep this a secret any longer. When the sun turns black and the world begins to freeze, at least you'll have some idea of what's going on, small comfort it may be."},"297":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game?

Maybe things are different on the road, maybe I’d just never encountered it before, but it’s clear to me now there are degrees beyond silence. A pervasive realm of deafening quiet which, following the loss of Eve and Apollo, our group has unreservedly embraced. Constructed out of our collective trauma, cemented with a cruel mixture of grief, guilt, and harrowing self-doubt, it quickly becomes apparent that this silence is stronger than all of us. The challenge of breaking it remains unmet for the rest of the journey.\n\nWe spend the next few hours burrowing through a featureless corridor of maize. The stalks rise far above the Wrangler, leaving only a thin strip of clear sky visible like the painted ceiling of a renaissance church. I find myself glancing intermittently at the CB radio, half expecting, half hoping, for Apollo’s voice to crackle through the speaker, bringing words of comfort, or a much needed attempt at levity.\n\nAfter I catch myself staring at the radio for the fifth time, I decide it might be best to get on with my work. I plug my headphones into my notebook, bring up the audio files I’ve recorded thus far, and set about creating a very rough cut of our first day on the road.\n\n**APOLLO (VO)** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nI listen through Apollo’s first interview, making notes for the closing paragraph I’ll now be forced to write about him. When I have everything I need, I listen to the interview again, and then once more. It’s not lost on me that I just want to hear his voice, to lose myself in a pleasant digital echo, far removed from the frantic screams that followed him into the asphalt.\n\nI listen to Eve’s interview next. She bristles with excitement as she talks about her upcoming visit to Roswell, steadfastly attempting to recruit me to the effort. She had no idea what she was heading into when she stepped out onto Rob’s front lawn. Then again none of us did.\n\nThe thin strip of sky is turning deep orange as I reach our encounter with the hitchhiker. It’s chilling to hear his voice after the fact, to revisit the conniving, veiled pleasantries he employed against us. I cringe as I hear Rob’s hand grasp my arm, ashamed that I let myself fall for the hitcher’s trickery.\n\n**ROB (VO):** You did good, I’m sorry for grabbin’ you. I just didn’t want you to do something you’d regret.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s got you? I don’t think I wanna know.\n\n**AS (VO):** Rob, I-\n\nI pause the audio file, clicking back ten seconds before pressing play again.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s-\n\nI certainly didn’t notice that at the time. I’d been so shaken by my run in with the hitcher, and so curious about the abandoned car that I’d been completely blind to anything else that had come my way. Maybe Rob misspoke, maybe he meant to say weeks or months. But if it wasn’t a mistake, if it was a truth carelessly uttered, then Rob has some explaining to do.\n\nThe Left\/Right Game was posted online in June 2016, less than a year ago.\n\nI glance sideways at him, a wall of corn rushing past us as we approach the rest stop. Throughout this trip, every emotion Rob’s displayed has seemed genuine. The sadness, the anger, the concern. They tell a story of a man who cares deeply about the welfare of those around him. Yet at the same time, it’s strikingly clear that there’s something he isn’t telling me.\n\nWith every new piece of the puzzle, the car, the text message, the faceless creature with the ringing phone, I’m left with the dilemma of when to confront Rob Guthard with what I know. I feel I’ve gathered enough to bring before him, enough to demand an explanation, but there’s no way I’d be able to truly verify his answer. I have a collection of strange and perplexing notions, lacking in the common thread that could bring me to any workable conclusion. If I am going to confront Rob, I need to uncover that thread. Much like the greatest journalists of our time, I should know the answer before I ask the question.\n\nThe jeep pulls up onto a large green space. Staring straight ahead, I find myself puzzled by the way the ground seems to stop, as if the horizon lies only twenty metres away from the car. As soon as the engine cuts out, I unbuckle my seatbelt, climb out and walk towards the grassy verge. The rest of the convoy pulls up behind me as I go.\n\nI stop a few steps short of the edge, realising we’ve found our way to the top of a sheer cliff. A sudden swaying vertigo takes over, forcing me to take a few steps back. It doesn’t feel like we’ve been heading uphill, the road has been level since Jubilation, yet somehow I’m standing at the edge of a 400 ft. rock face, descending straight downwards, the distant earth shrouded by stalks of corn.\n\nThat’s the truly strange thing about this monolithic precipice. On either side of me, the maize runs to the very edge of the cliff and, at its base, the endless harvest continues until it stretches beyond the darkening horizon in every direction. It feels like I’m standing on the cliffs of Dover, staring over a golden ocean, its waves governed by the evening breeze. I wonder for a moment where it ends, then, taking consideration of the world I now occupy, I start to wonder if it ever does.\n\nA belligerent scream rips me from the view. The source of the noise is blocked by the Wrangler and the first thing I see as I circle around are the shocked, wide eyed faces of Bonnie & Clyde. Once I make my way past the Wrangler’s hood, my expression mimics theirs.\n\nLilith has pinned Bluejay up to the side of the Jeep, a locked forearm pressing her chest against the door. Her other arm has been grasped in Bluejay’s hands, desperately stopped before it can strike her across the face. The two of them yell through gritted teeth as Lilith struggles furiously against her, vying to cause her any conceivable harm.\n\n**BLUEJAY** Get the fuck off me you bitch! Get off!\n\nI take a few quick steps over to Lilith as Bluejay attempts to kick her away.\n\n**AS:** Lilith, we can’t do this… Jen…\n\nLilith doesn’t even register my presence as she continues her assault, deafened by the bubbling vitriol in every growling breath.\n\n**AS:** Jen! We are not doing this now. Not after-\n\nBefore I can comprehend what’s happening, I’m staring at the sky, my head knocked back by the force of Lilith’s flailing elbow. A hot, raw ache radiates across my lower lip as I stagger back, raising my hand over my mouth.\n\nBefore Lilith can continue her assault, Rob swings open his door and takes two short strides over to her. He puts one arm around the girl’s waist and picks her up, carrying her safely, but firmly, over to Bonnie & Clyde’s Ford, and planting her back on the ground.\n\nI seem to always forget how strong he is.\n\n**ROB:** Damnit this is not the time.\n\n**LILITH:** Take it back!\n\nBluejay has lost her usual snide demeanour, yet her aura still radiates an unbridled scorn. In response to Lilith’s demand, Bluejay walks back to her car and sits on the hood. She takes the Marlboros out of her pocket along with her lighter, and ignites a cigarette. I imagine the burning embers are the only company she’s comfortable to accept right now.\n\nBy the time I look back to the rest of the group, Lilith has stormed away.\n\n**AS:** What did she say?\n\n**BONNIE:** I didn’t hear it all.\n\n**AS:** What did she say Bonnie?\n\n**BONNIE:** I heard something about… she said Lilith was… that we were complicit.\n\n**ROB:** Ah goddamnit… Bristol can you…\n\nI watch Lilith, as she sits on the grass and looks over the cliffside. She begins to cry, yet I get a strong notion that it’s not something I should interrupt. It feels like something between her and Eve, a final act of reactionary mourning reserved for them, and them alone. \n\n**AS:** Yeah… don’t worry. I’ll handle it.\n\n**ROB:** Ok. I’ll cook us somethin’ up.\n\nAn hour passes. Lilith grows slowly calmer, drifting from cathartic release into a cold, wordless melancholy. Finishing up my dinner, I make my way over to her.\n\n**AS:** It’s a strange view.\n\nLilith looks up at me. Her face falls.\n\n**LILITH:** I cut you… I’m so sorry.\n\n**AS:** It’s fine. You should see the other girl.\n\n**LILITH:** Hah, yeah, I bet she looks like shit right about now.\n\nI help myself down onto the cool ground, staring alongside Lilith into the ocean below.\n\n**LILITH:** Bluejay thinks I’m complicit… in what happened to Eve.\n\n**AS:** I heard.\n\n**LILITH:** She used to think we were morons, now she thinks we’re all in on it… doesn’t make sense.\n\n**AS:** I think she he has to believe this place is a lie. She needs it to make sense, and the harder it gets for her to rationalise the more she... Anyway, she shouldn’t have said what she said. She’s just... I guess the word is \"troubled\".\n\n**LILITH:** She’s a fucking thundercunt.\n\n**AS:** Umm… uh… ok.\n\n**LILITH:** She’s right though... I killed her... and I killed Apollo too.\n\nI look to Lilith, concerned, not quite sure what she means. Her eyes remain locked on the impossible horizon.\n\n**LILITH:** Sarah… she wasn’t cut out for this, and she knew it. She wanted us to turn back this morning… but I didn’t want to.\n\n**AS:** That wasn’t just your decision Lilith.\n\n**LILITH:** Yes it was. She uh… she followed my lead. Always. Through everything. And I knew why she was doing it. I knew. But I let it continue, because it was convenient, because it was easy…. because deep down I liked having someone around who… who’d jump through fucking hoops for me… god it’s so fucked.\n\nLilith rests her head in her hands.\n\n**LILITH:** She was weak. She was anxious and shy and… but that should be ok, right? You’re allowed to be weak that’s… but I made her come here. I dragged someone who couldn’t swim into the fucking deep end. And the last thing I did was lie to her and she fucking knew it.\n\nLilith takes a few deep, frayed breaths.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**LILITH:** I’m not uh… I didn’t, I… I loved her, you know as a… as a friend. It was always this fucking one-way street and… I don’t think she minded but. Then suddenly she’s vanishing right in-fucking-front of me and she said what she said… I mean how else was I supposed to respond to that? I had to say it back right?\n\nLilith maintains her composure as a steady stream of tears roll down her cheek.\n\n**AS:** I don’t know what I’d do in that situation.\n\n**LILITH:** I could see it in her eyes that she didn’t believe me. Fuck… I wonder how many people have died while being told like… comforting lies. How many of them fucking knew?\n\n**AS:** I think you did the best you could Jen. I think you did better than most.\n\n**LILITH:** You don’t need to tell me that just… are you tired? Do you need to go to bed soon?\n\n**AS:** No, I don’t need to.\n\n**LILITH:** There are some beers in uh… in Apollo’s bag. Is that like… looting? Or is that ok?\n\n**AS:** I think he’d want us to have them, as long as he got a toast.\n\nLilith laughs briefly and finally smiles. She walks over to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, returning a moment later with a four pack.\n\nWe spend the next hour and a half slowly drinking them. Lilith can’t muster the right words for a toast so we just say thank you to Apollo, raising out cans to the open air. We talk about his tireless humour, his attempts to keep us all up during our first night on the road, how caringly he spoke to everyone, even at the edge of death. \n\nWe talk about Eve as well, about the pair’s misadventures, awkward college parties and the future of Paranormicon. Lilith smiles, and tells me there’s always a place for me once radio dies out.\n\nAfter everything that’s happened on the road, the night can’t help but feel bittersweet. But for once, on a solitary cliff side in the middle of nowhere, it’s more sweet than it is bitter. That may not be much, but at the end of an awful day it’s more than either of us could have hoped for.\n\n*****\n\nThe next morning goes quickly. It’s amazing how efficient a group of people can be when none of them feel like talking. Not only that, but breakfast has become a noticeably brief affair. I manage to get through half a bag of trail mix before I find myself uncomfortably full. Rob’s words about the road’s sustaining properties ring in my ears as I look around the group. Everyone leaves their bowls half empty. Lilith hasn’t eaten a bite.\n\nBy this point, the launch protocol has been drilled into us. Despite our preoccupations, and the fractious rifts developing between us, the cars line up like clockwork as they merge onto the road. In fact, the mood of the group seems strangely procedural. All radio contact starts with the stating of a call sign, followed by that of the recipient. The cars maintain an even, careful distance between one another. We’ve seen all too clearly what happens when the rules are neglected, and no one wants to take chances any more.\n\n**AS:** How far away are we?\n\n**ROB:** From where?\n\n**AS:** You haven’t got to the end of this road right? I mean… you’re still charting it?\n\n**ROB:** That’s right.\n\n**AS:** Well, how long until we get to… you know to… uncharted territory?\n\n**ROB:** To be honest, not too long.\n\n**AS:** What’s going to happen once we reach that point?\n\n**ROB:** We’re gonna keep drivin’.\n\n**AS:** Until we get to the end?\n\n**ROB:** That’s the plan. You know I won’t judge you if you wanna turn around. I’m sure you can talk someone into it.\n\n**AS:** Could I talk you into it?\n\nRob smiles.\n\n**ROB:** ‘Fraid not. This trip ain’t like the others. Road’s kickin’ back like never before. I think it knows I’m comin’ all the way this time.\n\n**AS:** … What is this place Rob?\n\nRob sighs as he slowly takes the next left on a quiet, rural T-junction.\n\n**ROB:** I think it’s a stray thread… runnin’ off the spool.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**BONNIE:** Rob you just took the wrong turn.\n\nAn instant drum of fresh panic hammers in my chest. I stare at Rob, and he stares right back. I know he’s feeling the same thing I am, though he’s doing a much better job of keeping it off his face.\n\nHe thinks carefully for a moment.\n\n**ROB:** No… no. I been down this road before. We took a right last time.\n\n**AS:** Uhhh… yeah. Yes. The turn before this one was a right, I remember.\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman to all cars. Thanks Bonnie for giving us the fright of our lives. We’re on the righ… we’re on the correct road.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no that can’t be its… that’s wrong… Martin tell them…\n\n**CLYDE:** Our mistake Rob, let’s keep going.\n\n**LILITH:** Bristol…\n\nThere’s concern in Lilith’s voice. I lean over to my wing mirror, attempting to gauge the atmosphere in the car behind me. There’s clearly some commotion between Bonnie and Clyde, with the latter attempting to gently remove the walkie talkie from his sister’s hands.\n\nThere’s something else however. Past Bonnie & Clyde. Past Bluejay. An old, dilapidated road sign made of weathered timber stands by the side of the road behind us. I can’t read all of it as the peeling letters grow ever smaller, but I can piece together what it probably once said.\n\n“Wintery Bay – 5 Miles”\n\n**BONNIE:** We’re going to turn around right?\n\n**AS:** Uhh one second Bonnie, I’ll… check the map.\n\nI promptly switch off the radio.\n\n**AS:** Are we not passing through Wintery Bay?\n\nRob turns to me, a puzzled look in his eyes.\n\n**ROB:** Through where?\n\nIn the wake of those two, innocently inquiring words, my mind reels back to the morning of our third day on the road. Watching Bonnie and Clyde wander over to Rob to confess their transgressions with the hitchhiker, the quiet conversation that passed between them, Rob’s seemingly comforting response. I’d felt wretched in those moments. A few minutes prior I had tricked and deceived Clyde… yet I’d never once considered he might have done the same to me.\n\n**AS:** Is it safe to pull over?\n\n**ROB:** What? Why?\n\n**AS:** Is it safe Rob?\n\n**ROB:** Uh, yeah should be.\n\n**AS:** Then pull over.\n\nI switch the radio back on and grab the receiver. As I make a connection to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, it’s clear that an argument is brewing. Lilith is asking for me, a helpless passenger, caught in the middle of something she doesn’t understand.\n\n**AS:** Bristol to all cars. We’re stopping up ahead.\n\nRob seems acutely aware that I’m not messing around. As soon as we roll to a halt, I throw my door open and jump onto the dusty roadside, striding over to the rest of the convoy, who are just starting to get out of their own cars. I’m conscious of a driving anger behind each step I take.\n\n**AS:** You didn’t tell him.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bristol, I…\n\n**ROB:** What’s goin’ on Bristol?\n\nRob’s marches up behind me, more than a little restless to get a grip on my motives.\n\n**AS:** Clyde?\n\nClyde looks around a circle of expectant eyes. When he delivers his answer, he’s unable to meet any of them.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie… Bonnie talked to the hitchhiker.\n\nRob’s expression shifts, his confusion degrading into a solemn understanding.\n\n**ROB:** God… ahh Goddamnit. You knew about this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I told them to tell you the morning of the third day. I saw them go over to you I… I thought they did.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie… thought you’d… turn us around.\n\n**ROB:** Well she’s was damn right. You seen what happens when the rules get broken. You shoulda told me as soon as you saw me and headed right back home.\n\n**CLYDE:** That was before Ace… before everything. I didn’t know this place was-\n\n**ROB:** The rules are the rules Clyde! Is anything even wrong with Bonnie? You said she gets confused... was that a lie?\n\nClyde doesn’t answer, avoiding Rob’s glare. As I process what Rob’s just said, I have to say I’m surprised by the deviousness of the two siblings.\n\nWhen I thought they were telling Rob about the hitchhiker, it appears they’d instead told him that Bonnie was, to some degree, senile. It was a simple lie, but one that would adequately explain her odd behaviour, draw sympathy from Rob and, most ingeniously, prevent him from telling me about their conversation. A truth buried beneath an unpleasant lie, its subject matter just uncomfortable enough to head off any chance of discussion.\n\nStill, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n**CLYDE:** We can head home if you want.\n\n**BONNIE:** No.\n\nThe group turns to Bonnie. She speaks in a tone more decisive than I thought her capable.\n\n**BONNIE:** He... the hitchhiker... he was talking about a… about the village we just passed. I was looking forward to seeing it, that’s all. I’m ok really.\n\n**AS:** You’ve been talking about it a lot Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** It just sounded like a lovely place, I was sad that we passed it by. I’m sorry for worrying everyone. Please don’t make us turn around Rob.\n\nRob stares at them both. His position has been made crystal clear.\n\n**ROB:** We’re stopping a little early today. Come the rest of the way with us, rest up… then tomorrow you both go home. You should count yourselves lucky you get the chance to turn around.\n\nRob marches back to the Wrangler, signalling that the discussion is over.\n\n**ROB:** Lilith, you’re with us.\n\nLilith doesn't even try to hide her relief as she shuffles away from Bonnie & Clyde and climbs into the back of the Jeep. It’s a little heart warming that Rob still has the awareness to look out for her, angry as he may be.\n\nAs well as his surprising strength, I also tend to forget how perceptive he can be.\n\nBonnie, Clyde and Bluejay climb back into their respective vehicles. I catch Bonnie’s eye, the moment before she returns to the Ford. She appears truly disappointed, but otherwise resigned to keep going, satisfied to let Wintery Bay fade into the distance. It’s comforting to hear that she’s ready to put the place behind her.\n\nIt’s just a pity I don’t believe a word of it.\n\n*****\n\n**LILITH:** It was fucking weird Bristol.\n\nLilith seems happy to be in the Wrangler, enjoying the sense of security the modded behemoth affords, and also greatly relieved to be away from Bonnie & Clyde. She’s spent the last five minutes detailing the thirty second argument that unfolded between them, charting its disturbing nuances as well as it’s eerie conclusion.\n\n**LILITH:** ... but I swear she was basically like crying like… she didn’t understand how we could be going the wrong way. But then like, as soon as you pulled us over and she just stopped. Like I mean… stopped.\n\n**AS:** That must have been disconcerting.\n\n**LILITH:** You have no idea... So Rob, when are these cornfields gonna fucking end?\n\n**ROB:** Soon. We’re gonna rest up for the night in a few turns. Then tomorrow it won’t be long until we’re on a track through the woods.\n\n**LILITH:** The fucking woods? Are you kidding? Are we talking like… Sleepy Hollow bleeding trees or what?\n\n**ROB:** Hah, wish I could tell ya.\n\n**LILITH:** Wait, what do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** I ain’t been that far yet. It’s new territory.\n\n**LILITH:** Oh… great. Maybe the cornfields aren’t so…\n\nLilith goes quiet, transfixed by something in the rear view mirror, before quickly turning around to get a better look out of the back window.\n\nThe car behind us is out of control.\n\nBonnie is fighting to wrest the steering wheel from her brother. The Ford swerves erratically behind us, driven mad by the dynamic power struggle taking place inside it. Rob sharply accelerates out of the way as the car behind lurches drunkenly to and fro before skidding to a shuddering halt. Rob hits the brake hard, and by the time I’ve turned in his direction, he’s already slammed the door of the Wrangler, storming across the tarmac to Bonnie and Clyde. \n\n**ROB:** Cut the engine!\n\nThe Ford’s engine goes silent and in the absence of its rumbling growl, new sounds emerge. The sounds of a struggle, and of wild desperate screaming.\n\nStepping out of the car for the second time today, I jump onto the road and cover the distance between us.\n\nRob is attempting to pull a screeching Bonnie from the car. Even with his impressive strength it seems to be a challenge. Bonnie claws at the walls, trying with all her might to regain her grasp on the steering wheel.\n\n**BONNIE:** Please! PLEASE! Let me go! Let me go! \n\nRob extracts Bonnie from the car and attempts to subdue her amidst a flurry of flailing hands and elbows. She writhes and kicks as he pins her arms to her sides.\n\n**AS:** Bonnie! Bonnie. Calm down ok? Let’s talk this through.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me it was on our way! He said we’d pass through!\n\n**ROB:** He lied Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** No… no we’re going the wrong way. We’re going the wrong way!\n\nBonnie lashes out again, striking at Rob’s legs with her own. Rob holds her firmly, hit teeth gritted through every impact.\n\nIt’s clear that Bonnie isn’t going to let up. I run back to the Wrangler and open up the trunk. After a few moments of rummaging through my bag, I find the first aid kit and pull out an unopened pack of white zip ties.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, open the back door.\n\nRob sees me standing with the zip ties. Even in the midst of Bonnie’s incessant struggle, he looks at me with an almost questioning air, as if he’s wondering how we ever arrived at this point. As if he’s asking whether we can really do what I’m wordlessly suggesting.\n\nBonnie answers the last question for him. In the slim few seconds of distraction, she slams her head back into his nose, eliciting a disgustingly loud thud and a pained growl from Rob. Dazed and confused, his nose immediately fountaining blood, Rob manages to keep his arms wrapped around her. But it’s clear this isn’t going to be sustainable, and that she isn’t anywhere close to calming down.\n\nClyde has opened the door, stepping back and looking on like a frightened child as we carry Bonnie over to the back seat of the Ford. I lean in before him, adjusting the headrest until it’s pressed against the ceiling, ensuring that it can’t be removed from the bracket. I then loop a zip tie around each bracket and fasten them.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What the fuck is going on?\n\nBluejay has stepped out of her car, making her way towards us. I realise that, to someone who is fighting to not believe in any of this, the following scene would appear at best as a melodramatic farce, and at worst, as the attempted detention of an innocent and distressed woman.\n\nSadly, I don’t have time to field her questions. I climb into the car. Bonnie working constantly against us as Rob eases her in after me, his hand on her head to prevent it bumping against the top of the doorframe.\n\nOnce she’s inside, I loop a second zip tie around the one I’ve already fastened on the right bracket, forcing her right hand inside it. I pull the plastic tab over the sleeve of her jumper.\n\nI hope it’s not too tight, but at the very least it’s secure enough to keep her in place. Bonnie continues to pull against the zip ties, but it’s clear her strength has been sapped from her spirited battle with Rob.\n\nNot quite able to look her in the eye, I push a pile of luggage out of the way and climb out the other side of the Ford. Rob and I are both getting our breath back, the former pinching his nose and adjusting stoically to the fresh pain.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Hey what the fuck are… you’re not going to leave her like that are you?\n\n**AS:** Get back in your car Bluejay.\n\nI walk back to the Wrangler, tuning out Denise’s coarse protests. Rob reaches into the Jeep’s still open trunk, and pulls out a pile of blankets and pillows. In the rear view mirror, I can see him placing them on Bonnie’s lap, giving her a place to rest her elbows.\n\nShe leans her forehead against the back of the headrest. Even with her face blocked from view, I can tell that she’s crying.\n\nWe arrive at the rest stop some twenty minutes later, the vague outline of a deep green forest blooming on the horizon. It’s earlier in the day than we would usually stop. Rob tells us he wants the entirety of tomorrow to chart the woods, as well as good time to turn back before night fall should the need arise. I’m not complaining, I’m glad of the chance to rest up following today’s events.\n\nFor the rest of the day, we take it in turns to keep an eye on Bonnie, making sure she has everything she needs. When the Ford pulled up alongside us, Lilith, Rob, and I expected to see a quivering wreck, tugging ceaselessly against her bonds. We were all surprised, and more than a little disturbed, to find her smiling. By the time my turn comes around, the sun is already dipping in the sky. Rob has prepared a small pot of miso soup in case anyone can bring themselves to eat. I finish my bowl, all too aware of how unnecessary each meal now feels, and pour out a helping for Bonnie.\n\nI find her in good spirits.\n\n**BONNIE:** How are you doing Alice?\n\n**AS:** I’m fine. How are you doing Linda?\n\n**BONNIE:** I’m ok. Sorry for giving you all such a fright earlier. I feel terrible.\n\n**AS:** It’s fine honestly. I’m sorry about… about all this.\n\nI gesture to the zip tied restraints. Rob has reapplied them, fastening bandages underneath the straps to afford Bonnie a modicum of comfort. Still the scene rings with a sinister barbarity which no kind consideration can make up for. \n\n**BONNIE:** It’s ok. I wasn’t myself.\n\n**AS:** I brought you soup. I know you might not be hungry.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no I’d love some, thank you. Everyone’s being so lovely.\n\n**AS:** Well, we just want to make sure you’re alright.\n\nI submerge the spoon, drench up a measure of warm broth, and begin to raise it towards her.\n\n**BONNIE:** Oh no you don’t have to… I can feed myself…\n\nShe gestures to her bound hands, the clear implication hanging in the air.\n\n**AS:** No I… I don’t mind. I think it’s-\n\nBonnie throws her weight sideways, her elbow jabbing outwards and hitting the bowl out of my hands. Soup spills over my fleece, just a little cooler than scolding hot, and soaks immediately into the fabric. I back away reflexively, and watch Bonnie’s expression flicker like a faulty lightbulb from kind tranquility to utter, burning contempt. It’s gone as quickly as it appears, just in time for the rest of the group to look our way.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What are you doing with her?!\n\nBluejay storms across from her car, angrily drawing from a Marlboro and forcing the smoke draconically back into the air.\n\n**AS:** Nothing. Just an accident.\n\n**BONNIE:** It’s ok Bluejay, it was my mistake.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Did she get any on you?\n\nBluejay leans in placing her hand comfortingly on Bonnie’s, before turning to fix me with a murderous stare. It’s almost impressive how, even when caring for someone, Bluejay still manages to be simultaneously venomous to those around her.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no it’s ok it was my fault. It’s fine. I’m sorry for causing trouble.\n\nBluejay laughs at Bonnie’s submissive apology, unable to believe what she's thinking. Her eyes remain fixed on me.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** You’re a fucking coward. Look what he’s making you do. Look!\n\nMy eyes follow where she gestures. I have to admit the helpless figure of Bonnie, restrained in the back seat of the Ford, rings with an innate inhumanity, and being forced to stare my actions in the face makes me feel utterly ghoulish.\n\nThe choices I’ve made must seem insane to Bluejay, but that doesn’t mean hers are not. Despite her pretensions of rationality, I can’t help but feel that Bluejay’s actions are simply being governed by a different insanity. An insanity borne out of the desperate need to explain the unexplainable, which has morphed into an ugly cocktail of paranoia, self-grandeur, and fervent antagonism.\n\nBluejay notes my silent expression, most likely taking it as a personal victory. Without another word she returns to her car and shuts herself inside, festering silently and alone.\n\n**BONNIE:** Do you want to know what’s wonderful Alice?\n\nBonnie leans towards me, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me there’s a house… waiting for me. My home by the sea.\n\n**AS:** I’m sorry Bonnie. I don’t think there is.\n\n**BONNIE:** It’s going to be a such a beautiful place. Such a beautiful place.\n\nBonnie flashes me a broad grin. \n\n**BONNIE:** It’s been lovely knowing you Alice.\n\nBonnie turns away from me, placing her forehead back on the headrest. The grin doesn’t fade as I turn away. I walk back to the Wrangler, faced with the choice of changing into new clothes or my thermal pyjamas.\n\nAfter removing my fleece and lying down for a just a moment, I end up sleeping in the clothes I’m wearing.\n\n*****\n\nWhen I wake up, the Wrangler is moving. \n\nThe air mattress reverberates and my body rocks as we make a sharp U-turn. I sit bolt upright, Lilith waking up next to me, similarly bleary eyed and confused.\n\nRob is behind the wheel. The gear stick shakes as he transports us down the road at incredible speed.\n\n**AS:** Rob what’s happening?\n\n**ROB:** Bonnie got herself free. She’s headed for the turn.\n\nI pull myself into the passenger seat, suddenly wide awake.\n\n**LILITH:** What? How did she get free?\n\n**AS:** Is she with Clyde?\n\n**ROB:** She hit him over the head, dragged him outta the car. I couldn’t wait for him, but he’s catchin’ up.\n\nLilith and I turn around. Bluejay’s car is gaining on us, a distant pair of high beams steadily drowning the rear window in light.\n\n**LILITH:** Why’s Bluejay helping him?\n\n**AS:** She probably wants to keep an eye on us. Rob, do you think we’ll catch up with Bonnie?\n\n**ROB:** I’m workin’ on it.\n\nThe Wrangler continues to rocket through the darkness. We keep our eyes fixed forward, scanning the very edge of the horizon for any sign of Bonnie’s Ford.\n\nWhen Bluejay pulls alongside us, I get a look at the pair. Bluejay is nought but steely determination, dedicated to reaching Bonnie before we do. Clyde looks mortified, rocked by his sister’s actions, a small contusion on his head to mark her vicious betrayal.\n\nRob screeches to a halt once we arrive at the junction. Bluejay’s headlights are already illuminating the road to Wintery Bay, and Rob’s lighting rig coats the entire area in an artificial twilight. In the middle of it all, we see Bonnie, standing next to her car, smiling.\n\nShe’s already beyond the threshold of the turn.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda! Linda, please… come on back now, ok?\n\n**BONNIE:** You can all come with me. There’s a place for all of us. He told me. There’s a place for everyone.\n\n**CLYDE:** Please Linda. You have to come back.\n\nA strange trail of black dust is streaming off Bonnie’s skin, rising into the air and dancing in the breeze. After a moment, it becomes clear that the edges of Bonnie are slowly degrading, converting quietly into dark ash and drifting into the atmosphere.\n\n**BONNIE:** I love you very much Martin. You’re always welcome.\n\n**CLYDE:** No please… please.\n\nBonnie turns around and climbs into the car. Without looking back, she pulls away down the road to Wintery Bay. The trail of black particles rise from the Ford as she goes, with greater and greater volume as the entire car starts to wither away before our eyes. Less than a minute later the Ford, with Bonnie inside it, gradually dissolves into dust and scatters to the winds.\n\nClyde doesn't speak. His entire being is quiet. Lilith immediately runs back to the Wrangler. Rob waits a while, staring at he dancing cloud of dust, before putting his arm around Clyde and gently escorting him to the Jeep. \n\nAs I turn away from the road to Wintery Bay, I take note of Bluejay’s reaction. She looks absolutely petrified, more so than I’ve ever seen her. She impulsively removes the pack of Marlboros from her pocket and holds them in her hands, before quickly returning them, unsmoked.\n\nThe night passes slowly after we return to the rest stop. All of us are exhausted, and more than willing to surrender to the escapism of sleep. Rob rests in the driver’s seat, giving up his space on the air mattress to Clyde. Everyone drops quickly enough into a quiet slumber, leaving me awake with only my thoughts for company. I find myself thinking of Bluejay, of how she could possibly hope to rationalise the disintegration of Bonnie and her car. \n\nI wonder how I’d feel if the Left\/Right Game were exposed as some unparalleled magic trick. Would I feel foolish? No I don’t think so. Impressed, maybe. Relieved? Most definitely. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I miss the innocent days when I believed the game was a hoax. I suppose I see why Bluejay is so adamant about dismissing this place; trickery however elaborate is almost always a preferable alternative to genuine horror.\n\nThe Jeep’s door opens and shuts \n\nPart of me tries to ignore it, to wash my hands of any other developments in this harrowing night. However, exiled as I am from the kingdom of sleep, I slowly find myself sitting up, quietly putting on my boots, and letting myself out.\n\nI step out into the cool night, observing the figure before me.\n\n**AS:** Where are you going Clyde?\n\nClyde turns to face me, I initially interpret the look he gives me as one of resignation, but the word doesn’t quite fit. Resignation is a defeat, the world exacting compliance from you against your own wishes. But the man before me is as calm as the night air around him. His wishes are clearly his own. There’s no defeat in his eyes, but something else entirely… peace, maybe.\n\n**CLYDE:** You know where I’m going Alice.\n\nClyde speaks softly, a quiet conviction behind every word he says. I briefly glance towards the Wrangler, wondering if I’m really equipped to handle this on my own.\n\n**CLYDE:** Don’t call Rob. I made a mistake coming back to the rest stop. I shouldn’t have done... please. Just let me go.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, just wait for tomorrow ok? He’ll understand. He’ll turn us around and take you home.\n\n**CLYDE:** It won't be home anymore.\n\nClyde’s gentle stare renders me silent.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda had a husband once. He was a good man. Died young. She could never bring herself to go looking again and I… I never found who I was looking for. We’ve been by each other’s side for sixty years. Sixty years. I gotta be honest, even after all we’ve been through, everything you and I have seen, I never felt like I was in a new world until now.\n\n**AS:** I don’t think I can’t let you do this Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** I’m sorry Alice, but it’s not up to you.\n\nClyde breathes in the cool night air, exhaling through his nose.\n\n**CLYDE:** I yelled at her to come back, when she ran off to rob that ice cream parlour. I kept calling out and calling out. I spent so much energy trying to get her to come back to me. After a while I realised she wasn’t coming back… that I’d have to follow her. I should’ve realised it earlier. That’s all I can do.... follow where she goes.\n\nClyde looks at me, almost apologetically.\n\n**CLYDE:** Goodbye Alice.\n\nHe turns away from the convoy and wanders back down the road.\n\n**AS:** Clyde.\n\nHe turns around one last time.\n\n**AS:** Do you want company?\n\nIt takes roughly an hour for us to walk back to the junction. In the time we have, I’m treated to the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The warmest fragments of their life together, the moments that built them, the waves that rocked them and the places they once called home. I don’t think I’ll ever agree with what Clyde is doing, but the more he talks, the more I understand.\n\nHis stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.\n\nThe story ends just as we reach the junction\n\n**AS:** I hope she's out there.\n\n**CLYDE:** I hope so too. Thank you for coming with me, I know it’s late.\n\n**AS:** No… it’s never a bad time to see a friend off.\n\nClyde smiles at me one last time before turning to face the road. He steps over the threshold, past the old wooden sign. In the silence of the night, I hear nothing but his soft footsteps and the quiet breeze, which after a few minutes carries the last of him into an open sky.\n\nIt’s a long walk back to the convoy. My mind is numb to fear as I make my way through the dark, the corn rustling in the wind beside me.\n\nIt’s been four days since I arrived at Rob Guthard’s house, sat down at his table, and listened to him speak about the new world he’d discovered. In that time, I’ve seen things I can’t hope to comprehend, sights that exist beyond the spectrum of our reality. Things I wouldn't have deemed possible.\n\nFor all I know there is a Wintery Bay, and Bonnie has already arrived at her house by the sea, standing at the door, waiting with quiet confidence for her brother’s arrival.\n\nI may never know. But I do hope they find each other, wherever they may be."},"298":{"title":"Every month a parade would pass through my hometown, but we were never allowed to look at it","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bk0322\/every_month_a_parade_would_pass_through_my\/","flair":null,"author":"EaPAtbp","selftext":"I’ve lived in Arizona for the past fifteen years of my life, but I had a very different life before that. I used to live in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I couldn’t even tell you what side of the country it’s on, or if it even is in the United States. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a small forest town with dense trees in all directions, but where exactly this particular forest is, well, your guess is as good as mine. The only thing I know for certain in the name of the town; Point Pine. I lived in Point Pine for the first ten years of my life, before we moved the summer after my tenth birthday. Once we left, my parents never spoke of it again. In fact, they acted as if it never even existed, and to them, I guess it didn’t. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t really blame them either. I caught on pretty quickly and realized that they were trying their hardest to forget the memory of Point Pine. Whenever kids at school asked me where I was from, I simply told them I was from a small town that they had never heard of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also learned early on that any questions about Point Pine would be met with punishments. A few months after we moved to Arizona, my older sister Felicity had a school project about family history. She did it on our life in Point Pine and wrote about some of the things she remembered from there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur mom found her project the day before she turned it in and burned it in the backyard. When Felicity came home that afternoon, my parents took her up to her bedroom, where I heard Felicity crying out every few minutes in what I assume was pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said nothing, and from that moment on, neither one of us mentioned Point Pine again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcept for me, right now. I’ve decided to tell all of you about it. I don’t know what is causing me to remember all these things that I had locked up in the deepest parts of my brain. Maybe it’s the fact that my father died about a week ago. Since he died, my mom has remained silent; hasn’t said a word to anyone. She hasn’t even cried. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn fact, she ended up sending my father's remains off to god knows where (my money in on Point Pine, although I’d be crazy to ask). I’ve started recalling random little things about the town that, at the time, seemed like normal everyday things that we as residents were all used to. Now, as I look back, I realize that they’re not as normal as I thought back then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne peculiar thing about Point Pine had to do with the Point Pine Bakery. Whenever you went in there, the owner, Mr. Terrance, always knew what you were about to order. I remember the kids having some sort of rumor about Mr. Terrance being a magician who could read minds. Also, whenever you paid for your baked goods, you had to tip Mr. Terrance with an old item of clothing that you had grown out of. There was a giant box up by the register that everyone tossed old baby clothing and shoes into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the odd things; although you’ll come to realize that it won’t seem that weird in comparison to some of the other things about Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery year on your birthday, you had to get bloodwork done. I don’t think anyone really knew what the point of this was, or if they were actually looking for something. We just all knew that our birthdays would start off with a trip to the Point Pine Labs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone had to be up at 8:13 am. There was a system of speakers placed around the town like an amusement park or something, and at 8:13 am, without fail, the wailing alarm sound would ricochet through the neighborhoods, waking everybody up. This was followed by parents running to wake up their children and get them out of bed as quickly as possible like the house was on fire or something. Sometimes I expected it to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the Point Pine schools were placed in different areas of the town. Point Pine Elementary was towards the east side, Point Pine Middle School was in the West, Point Pine High was in the dead center of town, and Point Pine University was up on a small hill towards the south. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you hadn’t noticed by now, every place in town was named “Point Pine \\_\\_\\_\\_”. The Point Pine Cafe, Point Pine Mall, Point Pine Grocery, etc, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCertainly, one of the weirdest things by far that took place in Point Pine, was the Point Pine Monthly Parade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt happened every month; without fail. It was never on the same date, and each month, a student from Point Pine High was chosen to be in it. The weird thing about this parade was that we weren’t allowed to watch it go by. Not out on the streets, not from the windows, and not even on television. That was one of the most enforced rules; you must never, under any circumstance, look at the parade. In fact, for the most part, we weren’t even allowed outside when the parade passed through. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe always knew when the parade was about to start because it always happened the same way. You would hear a chorus of voices, like a church choir, singing a melody. It wasn’t a familiar one that I knew (I was only familiar with it in the sense that I heard it once a month). It sounded like it could be from a nursery rhyme or something similar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe voices seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. It was like they were coming from the sky, the ground, the trees, the buildings; like everything in Point Pine was singing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you heard the first note, you had five minutes to get inside a house or a building that had locks on the doors. This might come as a surprise, but in Point Pine, not many buildings contained locks. So, if you happened to be out and about on the street when the singing started, you had about three options on the places you could go; one of the schools, the staff break room in the Point Pine bar, or the fridge in the Point Pine Pizza Shop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne year in the month of August, my friend Lee and I decided that we were going to break the rules and not go inside when the parade passed. Now that I think about it, I’m surprised that kids didn’t do this more often, considering that well, when you tell kids that they must absolutely never do something...they often do that exact thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince we didn’t know when the parade was coming, where it started, or the exact path that it took around town, we decided the smartest thing to do would be to wait in the forest near the Point Pine Library until the parade eventually came down that street. So, we basically decided to spend about half of the month of August hanging out near or around the library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround the third week of the month, while we were sitting on the steps of the library talking about some random things that aren’t important, we heard the music start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee and I looked at each other and then took off running into the trees, while everyone else raced to the nearest school. We went far enough into the forest that someone on the street wouldn’t see us, but stayed close enough so that we were still able to see a part of the road. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe waited for a while, whispering to each other and then shushing one another as we waited for the infamous parade to pass. This year, my sister’s friend Reid was chosen to work on the parade. She was a few years older than my sister, but they were friends because Reid used to live next door to us when we were younger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were crouching in the bushes and leaves when we heard the chorus of voiced getting louder and therefore closer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Dude, I totally see it!” Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI straightened my back a little bit in my crouched position to try to see what Lee was seeing. I was always a short kid, even now I’m shorter than most guys my age- or any age really- so Lee always pretty much towered over me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I can’t see anything!” I hissed, shifting my position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Shh! They might hear us!” Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped moving and instead waited for them to get closer, where they were bound to pass right in front of my line of sight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Oh no. Oh crap!” Suddenly, Lee dove to the ground, landing in the fetal position, with his head cradled in his hands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What?” I asked, looking from him to the street. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I saw her! I saw that girl!” He exclaimed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Reid?” I asked, looking over to try to spot her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee grabbed me and slammed me down to the ground. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Ow!” I exclaimed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What was that for?” I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“You don’t want to look at it.” Lee replied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that for the first time in all of the years that I had known him, Lee looked absolutely terrified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned my back on the parade and sat down to look at Lee instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What did you see?” I whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Those things, they did something to her. They’re eating her, Cody. But she doesn’t even care.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked at Lee, who still had his head in his hands, and he was crying now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat with my back to the parade, no longer wanting to see. I heard the singing get louder, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Cody…” I heard the voices calling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Don’t look.” Lee whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Cody...Cody…” Now the voice sounded like Reid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Look at us, Cody…” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shut my eyes. The voices went on for a few minutes longer, and at one point, Lee started wailing. I kept my eyes shut the entire time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, it moved along and continued its way through town. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce we began to hear everyone come out of their hiding places, I stood up and leaned down to help Lee get up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce he stood up, he kept his head down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Lee, what’s wrong?” I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could hear him sniffling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Lee?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe finally responded as he lifted his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“It took my eyes.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never forget the dark, bleeding holes in Lee’s face and the cuts around his skin. I threw up in the forest for a good three minutes, before I was able to help lead Lee out of the forest. A few adults saw us and got our parents, who came and got us right away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day after that, my family moved out of Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never knew what became of Lee after that day. Minutes after we left, my parents acted like Point Pine never existed. It was never discussed, and I never had the nerve to ask about Lee again. As far as I know, Lee was the only person who ever saw the parade, and he was never able to see anything else after that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t know if Point Pine still exists, I’d like to go check it out again, but even if I knew where it was or how to get there, I don’t think I’d ever go back. I have a feeling that I wouldn’t exactly get a warm welcome. Although, I can't shake the thought that my parents were somehow still connected to the town, even after all those years."},"299":{"title":"A recipe for happiness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9ertpa\/a_recipe_for_happiness\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"On my tenth birthday, I picked a dog from the pound. The pound had several beautiful dogs – huskies and German shepherds, sleek bluenose pit bulls and even a redbone hound – but the dog that caught my eye was a bowlegged teacup Chihuahua with wiry fur and ears that seemed to sprout from his neck.\n\nHis fur was prickly and he smelled like soggy corn chips. He also ate flies, snatching them out of the air like a clumsy frog.\n\nSo I named him Renfield.\n\nBack then, we lived on five acres of golden forest. My favorite spot on the property was a hollow inside a wild hedge. It was the perfect hideout; you could only access the hollow by crawling along a hidden trench because the branches formed a thick, dangerous interlock on all sides.\n\nI took Renfield inside the hedge that night. I remember the way sunlight shafted through the leaves and flowers, turning the space into a burrow of soft brown shadows overlaid with coppery light. My little dog looked up at me, eyes shining like amber in the dim. \n\nI petted him until he fell asleep. Then I crawled out of the hollow and called his name, intending to confuse him.\n\nHe panicked immediately, yelping and clawing madly at the impenetrable branches.\n\nHis terror felt like a gut punch. I crawled back into the hedge. The way he looked at me is burned into my memory: wide-eyed and joyfully relieved, but terrified. \n\nThat look was all I could think of the day I put him to sleep.\n\nI didn’t have a choice; I’d have him for eighteen years, and had medicated severe heart issues for four of those. He was in constant pain, so it was time.\n\nBut he knew something was wrong. He was so scared, and I scared him even more by crying. Tears always terrified him. \n\nI tried to push away the memory of that first night in the hedge, of the way I’d scared him. But I couldn’t, and no wonder. Putting him to sleep, I’d trapped him again.\n\nOnly this time, I had to leave him behind.\n\nHe was my last lifeline. I felt him slipping away as surely as a drowning man feels a wave carry away his life preserver.\n\nMy crybaby tendencies didn’t start or end with my dog. Take my dad. He’d been in a nursing home for years by that point. He developed Alzheimer’s early. The descent was brutal and swift. As if that wasn’t enough, he had pancreatic cancer – automatically terminal and unimaginably excruciating.\n\nI stopped visiting around that time. Not because I didn’t want to see him, but because I couldn’t do it to him. Just try to imagine – you’re in horrific pain, you don’t know who or where you are, and your only visitor is a gaunt stranger who bursts into tears whenever they see you.\n\nI scared him to death whenever I visited. I made his disorienting, painful days that much worse. Stole what little peace he had.\n\nSo I stopped.\n\nI meant to sit with him at the end, when he’d be in a drug-induced sleep so deep he wouldn’t notice me holding his hands and sobbing. But I wasn’t there when he died. I was at my doctor’s office, digesting the news that I, too, was going to be sick for the rest of my life. \n\nI dreamed about my dad that night. He was trapped in the hedge and screaming for help. I tried to show him the way out for what felt like hours, but I was invisible. He couldn’t see me or hear me. As far as he knew, he was alone. Somehow, in that irrepressible logic of dreams, I knew it was my fault.\n\nI woke up crying.\n\nIt was enough. I’d had *enough*.\n\nI’m not stupid or naïve. Life is a tide. And the shitty truth is some of us live on a stormy coast.\n\nI knew this.\n\nBut I wanted a break. Just a couple of hours where I didn’t feel sad.\n\nSo I went online, hoping to stumble on some kind of guided imagery technique or hypnotic ASMR. Something to create an artificially happy place, at least for a little while.\n\nI tried everything. Nothing worked. I kept searching anyway, trawling increasingly weird websites far into the night because the search itself was addicting. Not a happy place, but certainly a distracting one.\n\nSometime in the middle of the fifth night, I found an ancient Geocities page titled:\n\n*a recipe for happiness*\n\nI clicked, of course.\n\n*Are you tired of feeling bad? Want to cheer up? Well have I got good news for you. My friend gave me this RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS that works like a charm!*\n\n*There are TWO PARTS to the Recipe*\n\nWhat followed was a pretty standard honey cake recipe, although the last instructions gave me pause:\n\n*Mix the ingredients together in a glass bowl, then spit in the mixture*\n\n*Cook at whatever temperature you want for EXACTLY 20 minutes*\n\n*Cut in half. Put half outside your door. Eat the other half during…*\n\n*PART TWO!!*\n\n*Take one HAPPY MEMORY and MEDITATE*\n\n*Think of someone who makes you happy*\n\n*Plan a perfect day*\n\n*Go to sleep thinking about your perfect day*\n\n*Do this and your sorrow will be eaten away!!!*\n\nIt made me smile. Eating cake while meditating on happier times wasn’t bad advice. So I gave it a try. I even spit in the cake batter.\n\nI cut the cake and set half of it on the porch. Tendrils of steam twirled into the darkness, lit pale silver by the full moon. \n\nI curled up the couch to eat the remaining half. For my happy memory, I chose that first evening in the hollow: my little dog, lit to soft brilliance by the dying sun.\n\nAs for someone who made me happy, I picked my dad.\n\nThen I planned a perfect day. Or rather, remembered it.\n\nI’d just started my first real job, and still lived with my parents. I’d had a good day at work. My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn’t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.\n\nAfterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.\n\nAs I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes. \n\nWhen I woke, that warm weight had shifted to my pillow.\n\nA terrible, painful hope coursed through me, one I couldn’t even acknowledge.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nSomething tiny lay on my pillow in a drying pool of blood. Fuzzy and weirdly dirty, exuding drifting grey filaments that sparkled in the sun. Three milky eyes glinted over a horror show of a snout: cracked and bleeding, bursting with an improbable cluster of human molars. \n\nIt blinked – each eye just slightly out of tandem, opening and closing with a soft, wet *click* - and smiled. Ropes of bloody drool leaked between its teeth. It placed two cold paws on my face.\n\nThen it lowered its mouth over my own and inhaled.\n\nBreath and blood and every organ in my body seemed to travel up my esophagus. Like God Himself was sucking my guts through a straw.\n\nI whipped my head from side to side as the awful bottleneck sensation intensified.  All my guts were coming up, and so were emotions - no, *memories*: half-forgotten nightmares. Painful images of my withered father. The last time I saw my mother, dressed for work and setting a bowl of oatmeal on the counter while driving rain fell.  And my dog, my poor little dog, trying to run from the needle up until the very end.  \n\nI screamed into the mouth of the monster. I expected it to fly off, but it *inflated*: a furry flesh balloon growing, growing, growing –\n\nWithout warning, it let go.\n\nI stumbled back, gagging. The monster – an engorged orb the size of a German Shepherd – simply smiled. Hazy morning light filtered through the window, bathing it in soft white.\n\nRage inexplicably built in my chest, growing exponentially every second.\n\n“Are,” it croaked, then burped.\n\nI wanted to kill it, to plunge my arms elbow-deep into its disgusting, distended body, and –\n\n“Are you sad?” it asked.\n\nA storm of emotion – rage, disgust, contempt, even hilarity – roiled through me. Overwhelming, overpowering, and paralyzing.\n\n“No. You have no sadness.” It poked its belly with a ridiculousy small hand. “I have it.”\n\nIt took a long, long time, but I finally realized that this absurd abomination hadn’t eaten my guts.\n\nIt ate my feelings.\n\nNo sadness. No pain. No more stinging memories. Rage and confusion, sure. But underneath that was a satisfied calm akin to bliss.\n\nI left it alone in my bedroom and went for a drive.\n\nWhen I came back, I asked, “What are you?”\n\n“A special treat,” it answered.\n\nI decided I’d had a psychotic break, and voluntarily checked myself into a hospital. After two days of assessments, they found nothing wrong. Why would they? I was on an even keel, basking in a curiously blank inner peace.\n\nWhen I got home, the monster was in my bed. Jolly, indecent roundness had withered to skeletal proportions. It looked awful. Starved. \n\n“I need,” it gasped. “I need, or you will suffer again.”\n\nThe prospect of returning to a life of despair, of *loss*, was crushing; I couldn’t even fathom how I’d survived it in the first, and felt I’d never be able to do it again.\n\nSo I knelt by the bed and opened my mouth. The monster latched on and inhaled. The unpleasant bottleneck sensation returned: like my insides were crowding my windpipe. And with it, memories and feelings: the rage I’d experienced upon meeting the monster; contempt at its ugliness; the fear of insanity. And more: my dog, old and grey, waddling happily after me. My father in his hospital bed, smiling uncertainly as he said my name for the last night. And more, and more –\n\nI wrenched away, gasping. The monster smiled, fat and rotund again.\n\nOver the following days, we developed a routine. I went to work and attended doctor appointments, even visited friends. Then I came home and let the monster extract my negative feelings. Bad client at work? Removed and forgotten before the memory could sink in. Friend who wouldn’t make eye contact? What did I care, my pet monster would take care of it like he took care of everything else.\n\nThat’s what it did, you see: removed the feelings, the vibrancy, the *pain,* from painful things. Over the course of several weeks, it removed everything; I knew, dimly, that I experienced awful things on a daily basis, but I didn’t *remember* them.\n\nThe monster removed triggers, too: before the year was up, the sight of my dog’s bed no longer made me cry. Photos of my parents held almost no interest; I flipped through them on a regular basis, skimming places and faces that had so recently crushed me.\n\nAll the while, that peaceable bliss intensified. I flitted through life in a pleasant haze of calmness. My work life improved. My supervisor started talking about a promotion because I was so unflappable, so decisive. My friends were able to look at me again. And – for the first time in months – I was confident enough to reach out to them. \n\nOne day as I drove home from work, I realized I hadn’t looked at my photos in a very long time. It’s not that I cared, exactly. But it was a deviation. Those things no longer caused me pain, and I had nothing better to do.  So why not view them?\n\nI got home and obediently kneeled. The monster – now the size of a horse, twisted and bent like a mutated spider – fixed its mouth over mine. I’d come to enjoy the process. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, but familiar. And afterward, I always felt *happy*: peaceful, empty, and warm.\n\nWhen it finished, I opened my mother’s photo album and began to browse.\n\nAfter a while, I realized I didn’t recognize anybody. I remembered remembering them.\n\nBut I didn’t remember them.\n\nThe stout man with curly hair like mine, the athletic woman who smiled like me, and the numerous people who wove in and out of this photographic narrative…they all were strangers. \n\nI reached a picture of my ten-year-old self cuddling a ragged, homely Chihuahua. Ghosts of memories tickled my brain, urging me to remember, urging me to *know.* \n\nAnd I understood, finally, that I had lost something.\n\nI don’t know why I cared. I felt so happy. Peaceful. My life was painless. I was great.\n\nBut I was also selfish. And I didn’t like the idea that the monster had taken so much.  Where was the line between happiness and emptiness? I didn’t want to be empty. I wanted to be full.\n\nSo, after many days of deliberation, I decided to make a change.\n\nI called off work, canceled much-needed doctor appointments, and settled in to search online.\n\n“What are you doing?” the monster asked.\n\n“Looking up some special recipes,” I said with a bland smile.\n\nIt took seven days, but I found the original recipe. At the bottom of the page was another entry:\n\n*a recipe for sadness*\n\nUnderneath were the words:\n\n*If you’re really dumb, you can undo happiness =( You shouldn’t, but it’s up to you. So here.*\n\n*Mix cake batter folloing the INSTRUCTIONS above*\n\n*Cut your hand and drip your blood into the batter*\n\n*Cook the cake as instructed Above*\n\n*Cut the cake in half*\n\n*Give half to your Happiness, and eat the other half*\n\n*Now here’s the sad part!!*\n\n*Remember the happy memory you meditated on*\n\n*Remember the person who made you happy*\n\n*Remember your perfect day*\n\n*Choose one to forget, OR…*\n\n*Choose to never be happy again*\n\n*Or better yet, don’t kill your happiness in the first place!*\n\nI agonized for days.\n\nMy monster – my happiness, my joy – continued to drain my pain, uncertainty, and fear. He quickly grew to three times his size.\n\nFinally, I made my decision.\n\nIt would be better to live in pain forever than to forget my father, my mother, or my dog.\n\nSo I followed the recipe: sweet honey cake, poisoned with blood instead of saliva. Then I cut it in half and brought it to my monster.\n\nI expected something awful. A fight that left my bloody shreds ground into the carpet. \n\nBut the monster only smiled. Round, flat eyes the size of dinner plates fixed on the blood cake. “What is that?”\n\n“A special recipe.” I gulped, but the beast was so focused on the cake that it didn’t notice. “Just for you.”\n\n“Thank you.” It opened its mouth.\n\nI placed the cake delicately on its tongue. It chewed eagerly, and shrank. Fat, firm sides caved, ragged rolls of empty flesh falling against its bones.\n\nPain built in my guts and chest, roiling and fluttering. Shivers wracked my spine. My warm, even-keeled peace shrank along with the monster that had granted it, leaving cold desolation in its place. \n\nBy the time the monster shriveled into a flat, boneless mass of dusty fur, I was prostrate on the floor, sobbing. Memories flooded back, pummeling me, leaving me breathless with pain. They pressed against me and threatened to explode *out* of me, pinning me in place. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even dream of moving.\n\nI could only lay there and hurt.\n\nAfter my dad died, someone told me that pain is a fugue. It’ll break apart eventually, giving way to happiness again the way a nightmare opens to the morning. But my experience is opposite. There is no fugue. Sorrow is sharp, it is devastating, it is painfully present, and sometimes there’s no way out.\n\nThe recipe writer was right. I suffer every day, more than I did before. Like the universe is punishing me for those few months of stolen peace. It’s bad. So bad that sometimes I think I made the wrong choice. \n\nBut then I remember my dad. I remember my mom. I remember our perfect day filled with songs and bad jokes and warm, driving rain. \n\nI remember my dog, nestled in warm, coppery shadows.\n\nAnd even though I hurt, I am okay.\n"},"325":{"title":"Weird phone call?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/31lhc9\/weird_phone_call\/","flair":null,"author":"Cinastar","selftext":"So, I've got a story. There are complications I need to explain first for things to make full sense. Mainly that I'm not good at making friends, keeping them, socializing, ect. But, I am pretty good at online games. Kind of. Point is, throughout high school, I didn't have friends in real life. I had one for a few years I guess, but she chose her shitty ex-boyfriend over me, so. Whatever. Mainly I stuck with a group of people I met on the internet. Good, honest people. Still talk to most of them after 5-7 years.\n\nI had an online boyfriend at the time that I decided to move in with, and it wasn't on a whim, honest. I lived in Arkansas, and trust me, it's the shittiest place in the world. On top of all that, there was a bunch of family drama and depression going on. So a new state? Hell yes. I know him inside and out, and he knows me the exact same. Two months after graduating high school, I moved in with him and his family. We kinda broke up last year but we're still living together (separate rooms) and we're still really good friends. Anyway, I started playing this online game (P2P MMORPG to be exact) about right when I moved in. I was super addicted to it, and played it for the whole first year I lived with my ex. I'll call him Pat.\n\nOver that entire first year I had been playing that game, I didn't talk to anyone in-game. I didn't make any friends whatsoever. I eventually made two. We didn't play often, but when we did, I hadn't realized how much fun it was to play with friends again. One was a guy named Cody, the other a girl named Beth. They had been close friends for years prior to meeting me.\n\nBeth and I had this thing where we would go around in the towns of the game in skimpy clothing and recruit for our newly made guild. A cheap tactic, but we had so much shameful fun with it, we didn't care. Most of the time Cody would join our Skype calls and sigh deeply in the background of our incessant giggling. On our second recruitment spree, Beth ran across a male character and started flirting with him. This was our tactic, and we referred to it as 'reeling them in'. Eventually, I caught up with her and joined in. Soon enough, the guy had a friend of his join in, and his friend became my target. They were both already in a guild, but we tried to convince them to switch over to our side. In the end, we lost, but not without friend requests.\n\nI didn't expect anything of it, as I considered myself lucky to even make friends with Cody and Beth. A week or so later, I ran into their characters in town. We goofed around a bit, and soon Beth joined us too. A few hours of dancing in-game and Beth suggested I ask if they had Skype. I, being far too shy for that, protested and outright refused to do so. She kept prodding me the whole night about it, but I never did ask. \n\nThen a few days later, I ran into them again. They seemed quite the pair, never one without the other. I could tell they were really close friends. We goofed off for a little, as was usual for us, and then decided to do some dungeons together. They were good players, and it was easy to tell they had been playing the game for quite a while. After we had finished, the original guy's friend had to go to bed. I hung around with the first guy for a while until he asked me if I had a Skype. I felt a whole new kind of euphoria and excitement. I always do when I make a friend, like actually make one. One to the point where they actually want other means to contact me. So of course, I told him I did and gave him my skype handle.\n\nRight off the bat he wanted to call, and honestly I was pretty nervous. It took me days to start talking around Cody and Beth, and then days more to eventually become just a little bit comfortable. I mean, I wasn't even sure if this guy was an actual male in real life. Of course, there was no telling I was a girl in real life for him either, but I don't think he really cared. So after a bit of stumbling, I began to hold an actual conversation with him. God, I was out of my mind with anxiety but the guy was so charismatic and friendly, it was easily to feel comfortable.\n\nI learned that he was the same age as me, and his name was Jack. His friend was two years younger than him and named Kean. I told him about Beth and how we were pretty good friends outside of the game, even though we hadn't known each other long. Apparently Jack and Kean had been friends for several years, even having met in real life before. That explained why they were so attached to each other. I found it cute, honestly. \n\nThe next day over I met Kean, and he was much more of a soft-spoken, sweet kind of guy. Not nearly as outgoing as Jack was, but still more than willing to be friends. I couldn't describe to you how happy I was. Making friends is a huge thing to me, and when I do, I tend to cling to them pretty closely. Neither Jack nor Kean seemed to mind, although Jack had much more going on in real life than Kean or I did. I don't have a Facebook, but the both of them did and showed them to me, so they definitely were who they said they were. Honest to God good and friendly people. \n\nThis continued on for a few months. Sometimes Jack would be gone at conventions and the like for a few days, then come back and tell me all of the amazing people he met. I somehow knew I would never amount to the people he talked about. For one, Jack's a cosplayer. A pretty attractive guy. Me? I'm less than average and suffer from severe lack of self-confidence. All in all, I considered myself closer to Kean. We spent more time together and he was more like me. Reserved, bit quiet when we wanted to be. Soon, my ex Pat started to play the game with us. He also became good friends with Kean.\n\nPat and I agreed that Jack was... overly flirtatious. It was obvious he flirted with me just for fun. I always refused him, and never played along with it. But I never hated him for it. I found it more demeaning than anything, because I knew a guy like him would never be interested in me. I knew that was just in his personality though. It wasn't as if I could just say, hey, stop being who you are it's bothering me. I mean, I guess I could have but, it wasn't as if it were causing me serious discomfort or anything. I knew it was all a joke.\n\nI... tried my best not to think low of Jack. We would have long conversations about how lonely he was, and about how all of the relationships he had were based off physical aspects. Most of the time, I became his pillow of comfort. I'd tell him he was a good person, that someone would come along, that he shouldn't worry, he was still young. It never really worked. I suppose it staved off the loneliness for a little bit, but it always came back. I couldn't blame him though, I saw a lot of myself in him. I was the exact same way, except... no one really wanted me in any aspect. We were so similar in how we felt about things. The emotions he went through and explained to me countless times, I understood them all because I had felt the same things countless times before. I completely understood him, or I like to believe I did.\n\nThere was one day that Jack was discouraged over a girl he liked. Well, more discouraged than usual. He explained he was done with her, that he was going to 'hit some other girl up to see if she was with it'. That was just the way he talked. After all of the long talks we had had before over him being misunderstood by others, I tried not to think anything of it. He wasn't that shallow.. right? He didn't just want sex, he wanted an actual relationship. I tried hard to believe this, but as the conversation progressed, I started losing faith in that. I started to get disgusted. He wasn't saying things that were considered gentlemanly in the least. I was fed up with it and eventually stopped replying. \n\nI soon turned to Kean. I kept asking him why he thought Jack was a good person. Kean explained that Jack had always been there for him, paid for a ticket and hotel room just to meet him, and that he was better in every way. I felt... so incredibly disturbed talking to Kean. How could he say that Jack was better in every way? Kean wasn't like Jack at all. Kean was sweet, and cared so much about every little thing he said to Jack. There was a time they had a fight, and Kean was so beaten up over it that I had to keep him company so that he wouldn't tear himself apart. Kean denied everything that I told him Jack had said.\n\n \"He's joking. He doesn't mean it.\" I quickly retorted with nimble fingers, \"Didn't seem like it to me, not at all.\" Kean continued to reassure me. I couldn't really say much, Kean knew Jack better than me. Maybe he was right. Jack was just having a hard time. I tried not to act differently around him, but his image was already tainted.\n \n I talked to Pat about this too, and he agreed with me. He was a bit more harsh in regards to Jack, honestly, but I tried my best not to hate him. He was still my friend. \n \n Kean and I had agreed to join another server on our online game for when we were bored. It was a role playing server, so we made up new names, back stories and everything. We were both really excited about it. Kean began to play on that server a lot more often than our original one. Eventually, he started to drift off from me and Jack.\n \n Sometimes Kean would join our calls but simply remain silent as he typed away in reply to his new friends. I slowly accepted it. It's always been a fear of mine to lose friends after the shitty one from high school. As much as I wanted to believe it wouldn't happen, I was already prepared for it. I'm just that much of a pessimist. Jack on the other hand was pissed off about it. \"If he doesn't care, so what. We don't need him.\" It was kind of sad to see how easily Jack would throw him away. It was nothing compared to the way Kean felt about him.\n \n By this time, Jack and Kean had left their old guilds to join mine. We had reformed the whole thing, had plans for it. Of course... none of it ever happened. Kean was pretty much gone by now, saying he was busy every time I invited him to do something together. That was alright, I was growing used to his distance. \n \n One night, Jack and I were in a raid when we met someone in game that we decided to joke around with. At the end of the raid, I had jokingly suggested they join our server. Little did I know, this person actually took my suggestion seriously. Pat showed me the name of his character requesting to join our guild right as I was about to head to bed. I had a good laugh about it, and feeling great about meeting someone new again, fell asleep with a good feeling.\n \n The next day I started to get to know our new friend. His name was Curt, and was a bit older than all of us. The more I got to know him, the more I latched onto him. It's just what I do when I first meet someone. Several times Jack had tried to get my attention, but it ended up being bad timing. I was busy talking with Curt one night, then the next few I had to sleep early for work. I suppose I could have added Jack to the call with Curt but, every time we all were in a call it felt a bit awkward and strained. I don't think Jack liked Curt very well. I figured it was because I was no longer paying all of my attention to Jack, and I was kind of done with him acting like a kid about it.\n \n That weekend was a huge convention that Jack went off to. I was used to not talking to him for a few days because he was busy. It was never something that bothered me. I initiated conversation with Jack several times but we never really talked unless he initiated conversation with me. Mostly then it was about how sad he was feeling about this and that, and I kind of grew tired of it. This kid bitched about every little thing and hated his life over every small mishap that it made me so annoyed. Here I was, or still am technically, with full fledged depression, poor looks, and nearly no money, compared to him who had... well, everything. I understood that he had every right to feel what he did because that's how emotions work. Then again, it frustrated me. I never complained as much as him.\n \n By the time he came back, he suddenly told me we weren't friends any more. Completely out of the fucking blue. I was confused to say the least. I told him we could talk it out, or he could just act like nothing happened. And well, he chose the latter. I said, \"Fine, I guess we aren't friends any more.\" He replied with \"Fine, goodbye Amy.\" And that was the last I spoke with him on the matter.\n \n It tore me up for a long time. I had lost both Jack and Kean in such a short amount of time. I supposed at least I had Curt to talk to. He was comforting. A bit of a realist and definitely blunt, but, he said everything I needed to hear. No sugar coating, just cold reality. \n \n \"People can be like that. If he's fine with throwing you away that easily, he was never really your friend to begin with. He just wanted attention.\"\n \n A few days after, I talked to Kean about it. The first I had talked to him in probably a month. He replied with things like, \"What? Why would he do that... I have no clue...\" I explained that it happened out of nowhere. That he never told me what was wrong but it happened, and I was done with it. I was too grown up for kids games like that. And that was the last I had talked to Kean.\n \n Pat had received a message on Facebook from Jack telling him that he still wanted to be friends with him, just not me. Pat asked why, and finally I got some fucking answers. Apparently Kean had told Jack about the conversation we had had a while ago, about how I was losing faith in Jack being a good person. And just to note, this was maybe two or three months before Kean eventually told him. I just wanted reassurance. I'm not trying to justify myself but I wanted someone to tell me he was a good person. I know I should have talked to Jack about it. Then again, our friendship probably could have ended a lot sooner than it did. Jack apparently started hating me, and eventually wanted to cut all ties with me. Fine, I was done with it.\n \n That all was a month ago.\n \n Not even a week ago I had a missed phone call at 11:47 at night. My phone was on silent, so I hadn't seen it until I had rolled over and checked my phone probably ten minutes later. The number was unknown, but the area code wasn't from around where I lived. I Googled it and found it was from the state Kean lived in. Now, I had deleted both Kean and Jack's phone numbers, Skype handles, everything. Thinking logically, Kean was the only one that had my number from that state, unless it were some weird phone scam. I noticed that I had a voice mail. From my T-Mobile Visual Voicemail app, it told me that the message was three minutes long. Huh. Okay.\n \n I pressed play on the message and it was entirely silent. There was a soft noise that could be heard every second or so, a sound I recognized as sleeping. There was a time that Kean had fallen asleep on a Skype call, and he had this cute little snore that I remember fawning over. I recognized it as his. Well, he must have accidentally dialed me, I supposed. I listened to the message for about a minute, but finding nothing strange, closed the voicemail and went back to sleep. I was a little creeped out, but knew it was nothing important. I expected to get some kind of text message in the morning from him saying \"I accidentally called you last night, haha. Sorry.\"\n \n That text message never came. I figured maybe it was because we hadn't really talked for the last month, that we weren't nearly as close as we used to be so it would be strange to say that. I don't know, I was just making shit up to stop myself from thinking 'not even Kean cared about you'.\n \n Yesterday evening I got a message from an unknown Skype handle.\n \n[10:08:05 PM] ---- : Have you heard from Kean?\n\nThe only person that would message me on Skype like that would most likely be Jack. \n\n[10:08:34 PM] ---- : Did he call you? Or leave you a weird voice message?\n\nI decided I'd humor him a bit. I was still a bit resentful towards him, but it was a harmless question.\n\n[10:10:54 PM] Cinastar : Uh. Yeah, he called but it wasn't a weird voicemail. He was just sleeping. I figured it was an accident. I haven't heard from him since, figured he was busy with school.\n\n[10:11:02 PM] ---- : You didn't listen to the end of the voicemail did you?\n\n[10:11:48 PM] Cinastar : .. It was 3 minutes long why would I listen to all of that. I assume he accidentally called you too? Weird, I guess.\n\n[10:13:02 PM] ---- : Amy, that wasn't an accident.\n\nI didn't know what to say because I figured he was freaking me out on purpose, so I didn't reply.\n\n[10:15:22 PM] ---- : Something's wrong.\n\nI don't know what he means by that. I've been too busy with work today that I haven't bothered with the message. I'm pretty skeptical that it's anything important, but I'm going to listen to it eventually.

As I was waiting, I overheard the man behind me talking on the phone. One phrase caught my attention:\n\n\"…Yeah, I'll put the bookshelf up on Craigslist tomorrow.\"\n\nIt seems totally random, yes, but I was actually looking for a bookshelf. After he hung up, I turned around and said that I heard him mention selling a bookshelf and asked what it looked like. He described it as black, maybe six and a half feet tall and about four feet long. It sounded like what I was looking for, so I asked how much he wanted for it. He said $35, which was good enough for me. I told him that I might be interested in buying it and he mentioned that he lived nearby. We decided that I should just follow him home and take a look. \n\nThis guy was in his late forties or early fifties. He was living in a basement apartment, but I didn't think much of it. I followed him in and he pointed me to his office, where the bookshelf was. I was told to just go take a look, as he wanted to grab something to drink. He asked if I wanted anything, which I didn't. I inspected the bookshelf as I waited for him to come back and it looked good. \n\nWhen the guy came back, I got knocked over. He gagged and handcuffed me, then dragged me out of the office and into his bedroom.\n\nI've been trying all day to write a narrative of what happened next. It's just too difficult to go through it in that sort of detail, though. I think that for now, I'm just going to have to list the events and relevant facts. Sorry it's not in story form, but it's still too traumatizing to fully explain.\n\n• I was put inside an empty closet, which the man then proceeded to barricade shut.\n\n• I was left there for what seemed like a really long time, but it was probably really an hour or two.\n\n• As I was in the closet, I managed to get a bobby pin out of my hair. I learned to pick handcuffs a couple of years ago, but haven't practice in a while. I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the plasticky stuff off the ends. (Why is it that on some bobby pins, they always slide of way too easily and on others, it practically takes a razor blade to scrape them off?) \n\n• I eventually decided that even if I got the handcuffs off, it wouldn't do me much good, as he was larger and stronger than me and even if I could surprise him with not being handcuffed when he opened the closet, I probably couldn't do much more. I finished scraping off the bobby pin, bent it into the right shape and tucked it away for later use, if necessary.\n\n• When he came back, he took me out of the closet and tied me to his bed. He had a duffle bag with him. It looked like it had sat in an attic for a while. \n\n• As he was going through his duffle bag looking for something, his cell phone rang. He turned on the radio in the bedroom, answered it and closed the door behind him as he went to a different room to talk. As a result, I didn't hear what was going on. It felt like he didn't want me to hear, though.\n\n• I tried to look around the room and familiarize myself with anything I could use as an improvised weapon. The place was pretty empty, so there wasn't much. I noticed that in the laundry basket, there was a pair of jeans with a belt still on it. I saw a can of black spray paint. I was desperate for anything.\n\n• Ten minutes later (again, a best guess), he came back. \n\n• Okay, this is when it gets really difficult. It'll probably be a lot of information in a few sentences and while I wish I was able to better explain, it's just too hard.\n\n• He grabbed something out of his duffle bag. It reminded me of one of those head massager things, but more flexible and with sticky pads at the ends.\n\n• He affixed it to my head, somewhat covering my face. He said something along the lines of, \"I want you to remember one thing and one thing only: You don't mess with us. You stay away. Back off and it's better for all of us.\"\n\n• He plugged the head device into some kind of little machine and I felt these electrical currents. It wasn't quite like being shocked, but it was very uncomfortable nonetheless. They also gave me a really bad migraine.\n\n• At this point I've realized that this isn't just a random crazy - this guy is part of the network. When he finishes using the machine however, I just try to act really disoriented and like I don't know where I am. I still remembered everything (probably as a result of the chip malfunctioning), but he seemed to be satisfied that I had my memory erased.\n\n• While that seemed like a good idea at the time, in retrospect I'm not sure what the wisest thing to do would have been. \n\n• He raped me.\n\n• He hooked me up again and \"erased\" my memory.\n\n• I had to be all disoriented again.\n\n• He left me tied up in the closet again.\n\n• He later took me out and raped me again.\n\n• I think you get the drill by now. This happened for a while.\n\nI feel like at this point I'm useless at telling this story. I'm super upset. It's taken all day to do this. I can't keep going. I wish that it had worked and that I didn't remember. He was sick and terrible. I don't want to remember. I want it to stop."},"327":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

While I stand by that this is my experience and that I am writing this account as a way of getting this information out there, not as entertainment, I would like to address those who don't believe me.\n\nWhile I have been aware all along that there would be people skeptical of my story, I chose nosleep for a reason. As an online community, you give people the benefit of the doubt long enough to hear them out. If you don't believe, you can downvote and leave. I prioritized answering comments, but last night I just gave up. I am having a hard enough time dealing with all of this to have to constantly answer to increasingly mean remarks.\n\nThe types of cruel, insensitive comments I have been getting are uncalled for. Some of the PMs are even worse. Some of you are making me feel genuinely threatened. Others are just making me feel really discouraged and more firm in my belief that the world really is a cruel place. Several of you have suggested that I am crazy. If that is the case, *why are you trying to make things worse for me?*\n\nIf you sincerely believe I'm making this up, then consider this a \"the terrorists have won\" situation: You have drastically changed the way this subreddit behaves based on one story. What made nosleep amazing was the \"everything is true\" mentality. That just got shattered.\n\nIf I was making potentially libelous statements against a specific individual or organization, I could see this type of behavior being more justified. But I have not. I have not said, \"Here is this person – harass him because he did bad things.\" Your behavior is seriously unwarranted.\n\nA specific set of comments I would like to address are the ones about how I \"didn't tell the police.\" If you are marketing yourselves as psychics, change professions. Where I left off last night, I was still being held hostage. Calling the police was not even an option yet. Even worse than giving me flack for what I did do is being overly critical of something that didn't even happen. \n\nAdditionally, I feel that the type of victim blaming that accuses me of enabling future rapes by not reporting is especially insensitive. Most rapes are not reported and you are not just hurting me, but any other victim of rape that have chosen to not involve the police. It's a very personal decision and the aftermath of rape is grueling enough without a bunch of uninvolved parties intruding on you and questioning your story to no end.\n\nIn contrast,  there have been several of you that have been extremely kind and supportive. I have gotten many responses of people willing to hold my file and I've emailed it to two of you. I trust these people to deny having it, so don't expect it to show up. To clarify, they will only be able to open the file and distribute it if I am reported missing or dead. A report needs to be made in order for the file holders to access the data. You'll never figure it out otherwise.\n\nSo thank you to those of you who have been kind to me. Because of you, here comes the last part.\n\nBut first, **here is the end you should read if you don't believe me:**\n\n*I woke up and it was all one big, terrible nightmare.*\n\nGo complain about that now.\n\nFor the rest of you, here's what really happened.\n\nThis went on throughout the night. I don't think it's necessary to go into too much detail. But whether or not I was being raped, I was hooked up to the device at least once every two hours.\n\nAt around 4:00 a.m., he took me out to my car. He had my keys, so he drove us to a church parking lot the next town over. He made a phone call simply consisting of, \"I'm ready,\" then started hooking me up to the device one last time. We wait for a few minutes, then another car pulls up. A man in a ski mask gets out and together they move me over to the driver's seat. As the first man uses the device to presumably remove my memory, the other removes my handcuffs and the gag. Then the device is swiftly detached and they hurry to the other car.\n\nPresumably, I'm waking up in a church parking lot with no memory of the last thirteen hours or so. I sat there for about ten minutes, just in shock. I knew that if I had been found and taken, the others in the group could have it happen to them, too – with possibly worse consequences. This was enough motivation for me to report the incident. While it might not stop every member of the network, having one or two of them behind bars would at least be a start and maybe serve as a warning.\n\nI needed some time to figure out what to tell the police, so I started by driving to the nearest hospital. I went in, explained that I had just been raped and they started their standard procedures. They checked me medically, performed a rape kit and asked what I wanted to do as far as police involvement. I told them that I was fine with them contacting the police and by the time they finished gathering evidence and taking care of me, an officer had arrived.\n\nI had to tell him the truth to a certain degree, but I didn't feel like going into the microchip stuff was productive at this point. The story was that I was buying this guy's bookshelf, but that he then held me hostage and repeatedly raped me. As for how I got out, I said that at some point I had passed out or fallen asleep from exhaustion and that I had woken up in my car at the church parking lot. \n\nBecause I had a description of the guy, knew where he (presumably) lived, had gotten the police involved early and was stating some pretty serious accusations, the officer got a detective involved immediately. I was taken over to the police station and they took my car to search for evidence.\n\nI spent the morning and afternoon in interview after interview. Based on the marks on my arms from the handcuffs, the initial assessment of the sexual assault nurse examiner and the evidence she found, having information on where the guy might be, and me staying consistent in my story, they were ready to act. They told me that they were going to go talk to him, probably arrest him and call me that evening. My victim's advocate got me a prepaid phone to use until I could get a new cell phone (the man had taken my old one and presumably destroyed it) and arranged for a rental car while they examined mine.\n\nI came home exhausted and completely drained. I needed to sleep, but was terrified. I locked myself in, then barricaded the door to my bedroom. I secured the window, too, as best I could. I put some clothes under my blankets to make it look like someone was there and went to sleep under the bed, clutching the prepaid phone.\n\nFive hours later, I woke up startled and hit my head pretty hard trying to get up. The cell phone was emitting the most awful ringing noise I have ever heard. I answered it and the sergeant over the case told me that they had tracked down a man matching the description I gave at the location I had given them. It seemed almost too good to be true. They had brought him in for questioning, they said, and searched his apartment.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I felt like I was going to throw up. But what he said next just made me go completely numb.\n\n\"Based on the conversations we had with this man and our initial assessment of the information you gave us, it does not appear that there is a strong case going forward. We will still submit a report, but honestly, we cannot take him into custody and I doubt that charges will be pursued.\"\n\nI don't know what he said or did that made them go from being ready to get the bad guy to basically dropping the whole thing. Once I was over the initial shock, I tried to get more information. What had changed in those five hours? I tried involving my victim's advocate. While initially supportive of me, she didn't make any progress and now takes several days to return any calls. I got a local legal clinic to look into it and they came back saying that while it seemed strange, they couldn't find any signs that the police were in the wrong.\n\nThat's where it's at now. I've been moving around as much as I can in order to keep this guy from finding me again. Turning him in was a risky move and since he is still free, I'm worried about revenge. I am not planning on updating this story any more and am about to move again.\n\nIn summary, this is my best guess about what's going on:\n\nEither the U.S. government or a medical organization was working on brain implant technology. Someone with access to that research – probably even someone on the team – took that information and reworked the technology on his own time. The result was a microchip that, when properly stimulated, would store the memory of what just happened on the chip instead of in the mind.\n\nA (probably) small network of people had access to these chips and they primarily used them to hide acts of abuse. \n\nEventually, the chips malfunctioned and the memories that had been redirected to the chip now replayed with alarming regularity. The chips are placed in the brain in such a way that removing them surgically is highly dangerous. We have yet to test any other way of disabling them, as it seems to be high risk.\n\nSomeone connected to the network found me, held me hostage, raped me and assumed the chip was still working. I personally suspect that he did it outside of consent from the network. But having found that my chip wasn't working properly, it seems like he would have notified the network. That makes me think that others are now looking for me and the group, too. \n\nWhether they're going to kill us, implant an improved chip or do something else, I do not know. Sometimes I feel like the only way to be taken seriously is to off myself so that the police and everyone else know that I no longer have anything to gain. \n\nThey network has probably read this by now. Some of the commenters could even be one of them – I don't know. But I'm warning them now:\n\nIf you do anything to me, the information will get out.

Part 6 should be up tonigh.*\n\nOkay, everyone, I know you were hoping for part 6, but you're gonna have to wait a few more hours. I'm really sorry about that. I've been gradually trying to put it together, but I keep having panic attacks and it's just freaking me out to even think about what happened. It's still really recent and I'm still trying to even understand it. I think that ultimately, it's good for me to write it out, but it's really hard.\n\nSo, for now, I'm just checking in to let you know I'm still alive, not captured by the network and going to be answering comments for a bit to get a break of sorts from thinking about the most recent events. Besides, I feel strongly that all of you deserve replies, as you've stuck with me through this. \n\nBut the reason I'm making this post is also to ask for a favor.\n\nIn the comments, it was pointed out that I should get send the information to a few of my fellow Redditors in case something happens. I think that's a good idea. So what I'm asking is for people to volunteer to hold onto a file of information on me alone, as I don't want to infringe on the privacy of my group members. I will set it up with a password, along with instructions on how to obtain the password should I disappear (and how to know if I'm truly gone). \n\nIf you volunteer, you need to agree to not try to open the file unless it's absolutely necessary. You will also need to promise to keep it secret, obviously. Also, I'd recommend not trying to find this group on your own. I don't know how much help law enforcement will be, so I need someone with good judgment. I'll probably pick two or three people. If you're interested, PM me with an email address I can send the file to, as well as why you think you're a good choice. \n\nIn addition, I contacted my group with the suggestion that we should set up a system where if not a single one of us log on to our communication base for a week, all the data we've accumulated should be released to, well, I'm not quite sure what the best option is, but we'll figure it out. This is the sort of thing that every group member would have to agree on, so I don't think that we'll know today or maybe even this week. I'm pretty sure the tech guy is out of town and he's the one who would know how to set it up anyway. We also carefully discuss things to look at all possible options, but the suggestion is out there and I hope it takes.\n\nOne more thing: I mentioned part of this in the comments, but I doubt everyone saw it. If you think that this could have happened to you, too, only consider this as a last resort. Most of the time when we find someone who sounds like they're one of us, it's not the case. Over the last few years, we've only found nine of us – with two of them being sisters. There is one major symptom that all of us have in common that I have NOT listed so that we can still tell who really is one of us. If you sincerely believe this story fits your reality, please feel free to PM me. Just make sure to include the last symptom. If you're one of us, you'll know what it is. If not, you probably don't have to worry about the network. I do, however, wish you the best in your recovery.\n\nThanks for all the support I've gotten. I'm sorry that some of you are frustrated about slow updates, but I would like to point out that I'm going much faster than most serials I've read on here and it's kind of a necessity based on my situation. I'm trying my best to get through part 6, but it's really, really painful."},"329":{"title":"walls dripping in pure blackness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/m3s7w\/walls_dripping_in_pure_blackness\/","flair":null,"author":"0obeno0","selftext":"I was lying in a sort of basement underground room, in a random guest house last night, during my traveling around in Europe.

The email goes as follows:\n\n*Hey (Name Disclosed), I am getting a bit weirded out by something I found on a video camera, wanna come over and check it out?

I’d like to say it was a joyous occasion. But I can’t, in all good faith, say that without being a dirty lowdown prevaricator. That’s somebody who lies like the rug. Very dirty, dirty rug at that.\n\nThings have been pretty rough the last 10 years. I think it’s mostly because I’m easy to manipulate. At least that’s what I think my therapist has been implying. \n\nDid your mom tell you you better shop around?Because mine didn’t.\n\nHow rough were things in my marriage you ask? \n\nSo rough that by the end of our second year together Janice was taking multiple prescriptions to control her bipolar, narcissistic thing, anxiety, depression and drinking problem.\n\nGoddamn medicine chest look like Walgreens.\n\nIt was no small victory getting Janice to the psychiatrist.\n\n“Are you saying I’m not drop dead gorgeous and that men aren’t always showing interest?”\n\nIt was like a root canal but once the shrink saw what we were dealing with, out came the script pad. And therapy, lotsa that.\n\nWe had our ups and downs but I guess I never thought I was in Janice’s class. Me and my therapist were addressing that issue for the last eight years but after last night, I just don’t know.\n\nLast night, Janice, who does what she likes to call dating around, which is essentially doing God knows what with whichever of her myriad friends that she’s always collecting like toys in the attic, last night she comes home about 9pm smelling like a distillery and;\n\nA. Kisses me right on the mouth.\n\nB. Puts her hand behind her back and with a mischievous grin says;\n\nC. Pick.\n\nso I pick and she opens her hand with a theatrical flourish and that mischievous evil grin again pops in,  and she says, “take one.”\n\nJanice had two pills, one blue and one red.\n\nI got the red one. She placed it in my hand.\n\nI asked her what was it.\n\n“It’s like ecstasy but times 700,000,000.“\n\n“That doesn’t sound very good I say.”\n\n“Lindsay, this marriage just isn’t working. All I think about is porn and cheating on you any damn time I feel like it with a belly full of vodka at that\n\nBut my girlfriend got a hold of these pills through her new shrink and she said it patched up her and her husband after ferocious domestic abuse and now they’re like two peas in a pot and they don’t even eat therapy anymore.“\n\n“I don’t know.“\n\nAnd and here’s the rub. Although my mother tried her damnedest to raise a fool she failed. So, that when I was confronted with the pharmaceutical challenge on my 10th wedding anniversary. I knew what to do.\n\n“You wanna drink,“ I asked.\n\n“Do you have mommy issues?\n\nCould be pretty snarky when she wanted to specially when she was sober or just getting her buzz on. Yeah that anti-alcohol medication that shit don’t work\n\nSo while I was fixing drinks, I put the red pill in the cabinet in a napkin, and I took a multivitamin and then I poured two tumblers full of vodka.\n\nI handed her the drink, kissed her hard on the mouth and said bottoms up\n\nJanice took the pill and washed it down with about 2 ounces of vodka without flinching.\n\n“Now it’s your turn”\n\nI obliged. Janice knotted and drank another 3 ounces of vodka.\n\nI took a small sip for my part. I really much preferred the weed pen, but I never told Janice or my therapist about it because there’s something so odd sometimes and the way my therapist Steve acts when Janice is nearby. I could almost feel they are in cahoots at our couples therapy.\n\nJanice told me to come close she said tonight is the night that is all about new beginnings and the kiss held and it metamorphic into a lot of things and I hadn’t done in years but before it was over, caught up in the rapture, I went to kiss Janice’s neck and that’s when I felt it.\n\nScales I’m talking serpentine scales right under her jaw that weren’t there before we got into bed kissing while she was Trippin and she kept saying “this is not your father‘s Cadillac.”\n\nMy face felt it first but within a few minutes when we were disrobed, that’s when I realized it was almost like the literal autistic translation of death by 1000 paper cuts. All over my body.\n\nAs Janice asserted her dominance, the pain worsened. Now it wasn’t just my face anymore. It’s my arms, my legs, my stomach, my feet. Like being attacked by the sandpaper people.\n\nJanice began hissing and clawing, and the whole thing to send it into the simple fact that her skin was covered in scaly eruptions. Her eyes were almost yellow. She was definitely drooling, and I could not get her off me.\n\n“It’s ssssssso much better like thissssss.”\n\nTwo truths and no lie.\n\nTruth number one is I passed out from fright.\n\nTruth number two is I don’t think Janice noticed because when I woke up this morning, I had no problems I could not even dream.\n\nJanice was gone. The apartment was ransacked and I have a little red marks and welts that were bloody all over my body.\n\n“Went to get more candy. You better be home when I get back loverboy.”\n\nI scratched my bald head, trying to figure out this agreed to puzzle.\n\nSomething fell to my bare feet. I scratch some more\n\nMore stuff falls to the floor and it looks like scales. I run to the bathroom mirror and I say, “Thisssss suckssssss,” with a literally forked tongue.\n\nAccording to my reflection, I seem to be turning into some type of snake like reptile. And Janice is always good about coming back to cause more trouble so I only got a couple hours now I don’t know what kind of condition I’m gonna be in a couple of hours\n\n\n\nAnybody ever come across anything like this before big fat pill too little polkadots oh shit I still got one in the drawer. The one I didn’t take I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do. Let me go slither away and I can find a scientist and that’s when I had the desire to eat a rodent. \n\nI don’t want to eat rats. I got to sssslip sssslide away now. I got to. I got to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"334":{"title":"Hi, it's Implantation. I think I need to clarify a few things.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/k1xe3\/hi_its_implantation_i_think_i_need_to_clarify_a\/","flair":null,"author":"implantation","selftext":"*If you are satisfied with the story entitled \"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal\" and don't want to be sucked into the drama surrounding it, this post isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you are upset about what I wrote or are interested in the discussion about the appropriateness of the story for this subreddit, feel free to read on.*\n\nTwo days ago, I started posting a serialized story here on r\/nosleep. While it started out being hailed as \"a breath of fresh air\" and \"compelling,\" I have since then been accused of ruining the subreddit, enabling rape and generally being a terrible person. On the other hand, I've had people who have shown me amazing kindness, especially in private messages. The help and information some of you have offered has been overwhelming.\n\nNeedless to say, I think I've inadvertently made myself one of the most controversial authors on r\/nosleep.\n\nLast night I decided to remove myself from the comments and even almost all of the PMs. I was hoping to just finish the story, let the voting system take care of it and move on. But after criticism of my story moved from the comments and started coming into their own, I had a PM talk with one of my biggest critics and came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate for me to address a few things regarding the story and my intent. Also, having been on the receiving end of an unusual amount of debunking and criticism (for r\/nosleep), I'm throwing in my two cents on that as well.\n\n**How I started writing this story**\n\nA few days ago, after seeing a movie with a lot of potential that ended up being about aliens (again), I got caught up in a conversation about what is actually \"scary.\" I was of the opinion that monsters, aliens, ghosts, etc. have become somewhat of a crutch in terms of scary stories. My discussion partner, however, had the attitude of, \"Well, what else could we do?\" I defended the position that reality is the scariest thing out there, especially the things that people do to each other. I was challenged to prove my point and the next day, I posted the first part of the story. (Making a movie was clearly too time consuming and expensive.)\n\n**Concerning whether or not it is true**\n\nIn order to complete my goal, I went straight to what scares me the most in real life. I am perfectly fine with whether or not people believe that microchips planted by a secret network is to blame for my symptoms. What I want to make 100 percent clear is that outside of the \"Is it true or not?\" discussion, a few things need to be accepted as fact.\n\nBetween the ages of 4 and 11, I was repeatedly sexually abused by my mom's friend's husband. \n\nLast month, I was stuck in a basement apartment with an older man who raped me.\n\nWhen I tried telling the police about the rape, they were initially super supportive and actually said they were planning on arresting him. This was, in part, due to a recorded verbal confession of rape from this man. Despite this, my case apparently doesn't \"hold up\" and I am stuck in a very confusing place from both a legal and emotional place. \n\nBattle out the conspiracy theories all you want, but I will stand by these three things no matter what. \n\n**About sexual abuse and rape**\n\nSome people complained that my use of rape in the plot was distasteful. This mostly seemed to be people who were adamant about my story not being true. \n\nI would like to point out that whether or not you believe in the story as a whole, part of my intent in writing the story was to convey three things: the sheer terror of having to relive the worst moments of your life repeatedly and realistically; the constant fear of never being safe and having this proven true again and again; and, finally, the despair of being stuck in a reality where those who are supposed to protect you fail to do so and even make it worse.\n\nAside from the truthfulness of the narrative, those are things that I have to feel on a daily basis. I wanted to show that these things are, at least to me, far more terrifying than anything I have ever seen in a scary movie (and I have seen very many). \n\nNext time you are sitting in a classroom, movie theatre or religious service, count off every third female and every fifth male. Statistically, those people were or will be sexually abused or assaulted by age 18. It's very sobering to think about how prevalent of a problem this is. Sometimes, the result of this abuse is more severe than others. In cases like mine, it's sometimes debilitating – whether as a result of a microchip or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nI hope you can understand that in this story, it was not simply a \"plot tool.\" I was trying to convey the lasting terror that those things can cause. In my experience, it's one of the scariest things out there.\n\n**Was this the right subreddit for this story?**\n\nHonestly? I don't know for sure. With the byline of \"A subreddit where fear itself dwells,\" it seemed appropriate. If the mission is to tell stories that impose fear in an atmosphere where everything is real (even when it's not), it seems like a fair submission. If anyone looking for strictly paranormal stories, the title of my posts should have been fair warning. I was inclined to post here for a reason and I still think I was within the current guidelines. If the readers of this subreddit decide that they want to eliminate stories that do not have a paranormal aspect, it's something that should be taken up with the mods.\n\n**My thoughts on the civility in discussion**\n\nI see two of the major draws of r\/nosleep as being that everything is true and that debunking is strongly discouraged. My story attracted a lot of attention and as the plot thickened, those two aspects basically fell apart. Instead of opinions on the story itself, questions about what was going on, contributions of relevant information or other generally appropriate feedback, it all fell apart. \n\nWhat started as criticisms of my choice to post in parts turned into critiques of the way I was writing, along with people trying to prove that what I was saying was either implausible or simply untrue. This really broke the mood that r\/nosleep is known for and while I tried to offer explanations at first, it just stopped being worth it. \n\nBy the time part 6 was up, the personal attacks were getting more and more severe. People were making assumptions about where the story was going and bashing me based on those, going so far as to accuse me and other rape victims of being rape enablers. Personally, I think victim blaming is rarely (if ever) an appropriate thing to do, as it creates an environment that allows for continued violence. Part of the reason why victims don't always speak up is due to these types of responses. Only when people stop assuming they know everything and give crime victims the same benefit of the doubt that criminals are legally afforded can we even begin to address the personal and societal pestilence that sexual assault is.\n\nI think that this story and the ensuing discussion serve as a reflection of what r\/nosleep is potentially becoming. There's still time to stop it. Is this really what you want the community to be like? The whole reason I love Reddit is because you can upvote and downvote. Nosleep is unique because it relies on that system more than other subreddits, as they discourage questioning the author. Do you, as a community, want to keep this environment intact? If so, I suggest that you take a long hard look at what just happened.\n\nI know not everyone likes every story. That's okay. Just remember that Reddit isn't 4chan and r\/nosleep isn't Reddit. We have a very special community – let's keep it that way.

What people can feel, see, touch, hear, and smell is painfully limited, so 90% of the Earth's natural actions will never come to our attention. An example of our body's ignorance is the electromagnetic spectrum (both visible and invisible light), which anyone with even a brief history of science knows humans are mostly blind to. In short, there are constantly invisible events and beings around us that we will never know about. \n\nIncluded in these invisible beings are insects known as \"Spider T974s\" because they haven't been truly named by science. These spiders are barely poisonous, and only have venom strong enough to get you mildly sick. Ever heard of rhinovirus? *The common cold?* Sure you have, but most people sick with rhino virus have never even been near a rhino...\n\nSuch a funny coincidence... Spider T974s are supposed to look like horned black-widows, giving them a *rhino* appearance; it's only appropriate if I refer to the spiders as, \"Rhino Spiders,\" for the rest of this post. \n\nYou must be asking yourself, \"Well, why can't I see them?\" As stated earlier, a rhino spider exoskeleton mixes with light so precisely that the light's sensitivity is changed, pushing it out of the visible spectrum. Rhino spiders are very sensitive and try to move away from even the smallest change in the environment. \n\nLet's say, you're looking at a picture of a spider, and your hair *just barely* stands up. To the rhino spiders, that small change is quite startling, and sends them running down your arms or legs. There's nothing you can do about, because as recently discovered, there are A LOT of them. \n\nNatural predators can't see them either, so their numbers grow and grow and grow until every where you go is covered with them. I don't mean to frighten you, but chances are that your home, cars, and workplaces have rhino spider infestations.\n\nMaybe more difficult to come to terms with is their size. Sure, most of them are relatively small, but failure of crowd control by nature's natural hunters has caused some rhino spiders to grow incredibly big; some are believed to be as large as small children. \n\nThink about it, have you ever laid in your bed at night and heard scratches from outside? *\"Oh, it's just the trees...\"* The trees are always scratching against your house, but somehow *that's* the only time you hear it? What if the strong winds are startling the massive rhino-spiders outside, and they're moving around to become more comfortable in the storm. \n\nThese aren't pretty images, are they?\n\nIf you have a fear of spiders, you're only hope is to get over it VERY quickly, because the truth isn't going anywhere. Go ahead, wash your hands and brush you arms to try and get them off; it's not working is it? They'll always be with you, watching you, *on you* just waiting to give you the next bite.

It is aimed at YOU. You know who you are, and I wish for you that every thing your loathsome selves enjoy be done upon your person a thousand times over!\n\nWith that out of the way, allow me to commence.\n\nGreetings, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see, my name is Daniel, I'll withhold my surnames, as I would like to retain a sliver of that illusion called \"privacy.\" I am writing this under a crushing amount of psychological stress, and enjoying the placid stupor of my prescription drug -an anxiolytic, to regulate high levels of anxiety,- yet I assure you, I am as lucid as I have ever and will ever be. I wish I could forget what I am about to narrate, yet there's no nepenthe that could erase the things I have seen, what I know. I shall relate my experiences as a naive explorer of the \"Deep Web\" to the best of my ability.\n\nTo commence, I would like to give you insight as to what is this \"Deep Web.\" Imagine an iceberg, the most massive pile of buoyant ice you can conjure. That is the Internet. As you know by the ages old adage, the tip of the iceberg is the portion we can easily see; in this context, the \"Upper Web\" is what we can see on our daily lives: Google, Facebook, YouTube, YouPorn, this very Reddit we are on right now. As Mufasa would put it, \"Everything the light touches,\" our kingdom of information and socialization. \"But what about that shadowy place?\" asks a young Simba. The bottom of the iceberg, that which remains unseen is the \"Deep Web,\" and in a manner akin to an actual iceberg, it comprises up to an esteemed 96% of the whole expanse of the Internet. This Deep Web contains the websites not indexed by search engines such as Google or Yahoo, not even Bing, and as such, they remain hidden beneath the \"water.\" And just as Mufasa replied, \"That is beyond our borders, you must never go there.\" And what did Simba do? The very same stupid, foolish, unforgivable thing I did. He disregarded the warnings.\n\nI heard about the Deep Web from an acquaintance of mine, a fellow who studies computer engineering and, as such, has contact with codes and networks and other such amenities. At first I disregarded his claims about the existence of this Deep Web, and how could I not? 'Impossible,' methought, 'that such a vast repository of information and interaction could lie hidden beneath our noses. Ludicrous!' -And, for the record yes, this is the way I think and speak in English, as it is not my mother language. They know, and so do you have the right to know- At the time it appeared to me as a thing of legend, a vast reservoir of knowledge and arcane lore the likes of which could be found in lost Alexandria, or the ransacked libraries of Baghdad. The mere idea that such an inconceivable ocean of data -an esteemed 8 flaming petabytes! existed in our world seemed beyond fantastic. Like a fool I was seduced by the idea of seeing this occult side of the Internet.\n\nSwayed and tutored by my acquaintance in the ways to access the Deep Web, -ways that for your safety I shall not, and I repeat, shall NOT describe, so please don't inquire about them- feeling safe and sound within the sanctum of my living quarters, I clicked on the executable program that would link me with this gallery of knowledge. Admittedly, at the time I felt like the One after having chosen the red pill, about to embark in a journey through untrodden pathways of information; I felt akin to an explorer akin to Columbus, a scientist on par with Darwin as he voyaged across the Galapagos islands in the search for wisdom. Perhaps if my mind had been made of sterner stuff I could have withstood what I came to learn.\n\nAnd so I entered into the realm beyond the light. \n\nAt first it was a grossly underwhelming, anticlimactic sight to behold. \"The fuck is this?\" I intoned, as I was greeted by a blank page stating I had entered correctly. Was this the oh so famous \"deep web?\" A blank page with less flair than the 90's gif-fests of yore? I found myself feeling an abject disappointment; my thoughts of unknown secrets, adventure, and discovery had toppled to the ground. Now I wish I had left them there, never to be picked up. \n\nMy acquaintance sent me a link, eloquently titled the \"hidden wiki.\" Within, I found a list of links categorized in a wide arrange of topics: You could find links to purchase weapons and drugs in the black market, to arrange shady meetings, and of course, porn -much like life in the universe, in the Internet, porn always finds a way.- Suffice to say my appetite had been whetted, and I hungered, lusted, for more. \n\nAnd here is where I must needs take a break, another dose of alprazolam as this one has worn out. Let me tell you my diagnosis, so you can better understand my... condition, and to calm myself down a trifle; if you feel like it feel free to skip the following couple paragraphs entirely as they pertain to my personality and not to the story itself.\n\nAfter being entered in my local psychiatric hospital, which I'm afraid is nothing like what you see in movies, and being medicated, I was diagnosed with \"Unspecified Anxiety Disorder,\" 300.00 as cataloged on the DSM-V and F41.9 on the CIE-10 manual, and \"Paranoid Personality Disorder,\" 301.0 (F60.0) What this signifies is that I suffer from crippling anxiety attacks on a near-daily basis; I commence sweating profusely, breathe heavily, and more often than not I'm prone to attacking other people, hence part of the \"justification\" for a paranoid personality diagnosis. The idiots; what they did was, in truth, say that they knew I was anxious but possessed no idea as to what was the cause. That's what happens when every flaming psychiatrist suffers from an acute case of fecal encephalopathy. So, they medicated me, with the medicine that grants them a share of course, and called it a day. Of course they also hinted to my parents that I \"may\" be a risk for developing paranoid schizophrenia, since I'm within the age range. Twenty years as of the time of this writing, twenty one in a few weeks; they know and so you have right to know.\n\nIn truth, I do not have much to complain about regarding my medication, as it has proven to be respite. Respite and nepenthe from the memory of the lore. I quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this forbidden lore! Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.' \n\nAmusing how anxiety enhances your metabolism, makes things seemingly act quicker, but wear out faster. At least I need not worry about being obese. \n\nBut back to the story.\n\nAs I was relating, I ventured forth into the Deep Web in the search for hidden gems of knowledge. And I did learn a lot: There's a huge, expansive black market for weapons, drugs, explosives and any illegal thing you may imagine; exotic creatures abound and are sold at quite reasonable prices -if you consider $10,000.99 reasonable for a Siberian tiger that is;- counterfeit money was sold on a rate of 2:1, and PayPal accounts containing up to $100,000.00 sold for a fraction of their purported value. It appeared to me as a veritable \"Rosebud\" cheat, only in real life. 'Fantastic!' methought, \"ALLONS-Y!\" quoth I.\n\nOf course, inquisition and discovery, a lapse is necessary. And what better way to regain energy and confidence, than to ogle some fine pornography? What can I say, I am but a man. Intrigued by the... possibilities of what I could find, I ventured into the \"Erotica\" section of the hidden wiki. What first stood out to me was a link titled \"Pink Meth,\" a quaint name, but seemingly fitting for the purpose, thought I. At first sight it seemed to be your standard porn site, pictures of girls neatly arranged in rows, without a specific order to them; some of then scantly clad, others perfectly naked. Nothing unusual up to this point, merely another page that offered \"amateur porn.\" But then I noticed a curious link beneath each picture, the name of the lady in question and, attached to it, a FaceBook profile. \"The hell!?\" exclaimed I as the blue letters took me to a FaceBook page; her name, address, friends, family, IP, everything had been laid out before me. \n\nThis admittedly distressed me. The information I had access to could positively ruin a young lady's life. Not only that, it could be used for... other purposes. Suddenly the jokes about how \"stalking is much easier thanks to FaceBook\" took a much sinister meaning. In fairness, she should not have published those pictures of herself on the internet; countering that argument however, maybe she did not, perhaps it was a spiteful boyfriend or someone hacked her PC or something of such nature. I knew not, and it was not something I wished to know the reason for.\n\nI left the site feeling a trifle shaken. \"Poor girl\" said I, and I meant it: No one should be subject to that, let alone that exposed in her personal information. I know that subreddits such as \/gonewild or \/grool serve the purpose of exposing oneself, \"going wild.\" Still, it is one thing to do it willingly and deciding what information to share into the world, and a very different situation altogether to have your identity hung out before the eyes of anyone with enough time and know-how to find it.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnd a good thing that I do, at that. As I write this, I realize I have nearly reached the maximum amount of allowed characters; in a way I apologize, but it is necessary, for I wish to leave no detail behind. I shall continue with the narrative in the comments section below. I do not wish to cease narrating now, as I don't know if I'll have the guts, or the soundness of mind, to keep going tomorrow in a \"part 2.\"\n\nBut I warn you: From this point on, things may become... terrible.

I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I had to get away.  \n  \nBehind me, I could hear the sound of footsteps. The dopplegangers were still after me.  \n  \nI ran faster, my lungs burning. I couldn't let them catch me. I had to survive.  \nIn the suffocating darkness of my room, I huddled beneath the bed, my heart pounding like a drum against my ribs. The air was thick with the stench of decay and fear, a testament to the horrors that had unfolded within these walls.  \n  \nMy mother's diary lay open on the floor, its pages stained with blood and tears. I had been reading it, desperate for any shred of solace or understanding, but it only served to fuel my terror. Her entries were a chilling chronicle of her descent into madness, as she became convinced that her own reflection was trying to kill her.  \n  \n'They're not me,' she had written in a trembling hand. 'They're monsters, wearing my face.'  \n  \nI had dismissed her words as the ramblings of a frightened woman, but now I knew the truth. The dopplegangers were real, and they had killed her.  \n  \nI had been hiding from them for hours, ever since I heard their footsteps echoing through the house. They were relentless, their movements fluid and predatory. I could hear them searching for me, their voices a chorus of mocking whispers.  \n  \n'Where are you, little boy?'  \n  \n'Come out, come out, wherever you are.'  \n  \nI pressed myself against the cold, damp floor, willing myself to become invisible. But they were too close, their heavy breathing just outside the door.  \n  \nSuddenly, the door creaked open, and a pair of eyes peered into the room. They were my own eyes, but they were cold and lifeless, filled with a malevolence that chilled me to the bone.  \n  \n'I found you,' the doppelganger hissed.  \n  \nI scrambled to my feet, but it was too late. The doppelganger lunged, its sharp claws extended. I dodged its attack, but it was relentless, its movements faster and more precise than my own.  \n  \nWe grappled on the floor, a blur of limbs and shadows.

I didn’t believed her since I only saw normal house that very bit scattered. \nBut on the big white house were biohazard signs.\n\nDespite that my friend wanted to go in ,I first warned here but she convinced me to go in. \nI think the place was for lab experiments \nSince we saw a lot of bl00d and many test tubes. \nBut after some while I had an odd feeling. \nIt was weird. \nThe place looks weird. And it also smelled bit rotten.\nSo l decided to go out but my friend still wanted to explore and she was quite stubborn about it so I let her explore. \nOne thing you have to know is my friend is quite brave type of person. \nI on the other hand more reserved. \n\nI don't know if it even has to do with it but something is telling me why my friend is sick and behaves so strange is because of that abandoned lab we visited.\nAnd I still feel guilty about it.\n\nAfter the visiting she said she had pain in her leg she told me she accidentally hurt herself in there and so we gone to home. \nBut I decided to visit her but \nmy friend could barely talk. \nAnd she is very pale. \nI think she might has rabies since has foam in her mouth I think but for some reason it's still strange because rabies has usually incubation period for very long. \nAnd the foam was lightly yellow. \nI did call a doctor but they said it's not a big of a deal.

But I smelled something rotten. \nAnd through the window everything was covered with bl00d. \nBut also green and yellow color was there too. \n\nAnd then I saw the back door it was open. \nIt’s weird how can this happen my friend was laying on her bed just before I was going to the doctor.

So, when I noticed a new app, named \"Twelve\" on my phone one dreary morning, my initial thought was a forgotten download from a sleep-deprived night. The app's icon was unassuming: a black clock, its hands eternally pointing to midnight.\n\nTapping it out of sheer curiosity, I was met with an abyss of blackness. A single, chilling line of text surfaced: *\"You are now bound. Await the twelfth hour.\"* I tried laughing it off, dismissing it as a silly game or perhaps the result of a friend's prank. But the app defied deletion, resisting all attempts.\n\nThe true oddity began that night. At the stroke of midnight, my phone vibrated with an intensity I'd never felt before. The app had a message for me: *\"Look behind you.\"* Hesitantly, I did, and my TV—previously off—sprang to life. It played grainy, distorted images: my childhood home, my first school, places I hadn’t thought about in years.\n\nEvery subsequent night brought a new instruction. Some were innocuous, like *\"Whisper your favorite memory.\"* Others were unsettling: *\"Sing your deepest secret out loud.\"* When I refused, every device in my home blared my confessions on repeat until, in sheer desperation, I relented.\n\nAs days turned into nights and nights back into days, a pattern emerged. With every passing command, the tasks grew more menacing. \n\n*\"Place a candle by your window and do not sleep.\"* Doing as instructed, I spent the night watching figures cloaked in darkness gather outside my window. They never entered, never moved closer. They just stood, their attention unwaveringly fixed on the candle's flame.\n\nHowever, one message made my blood run cold: *\"Do not turn around, no matter what you hear.\"* The night that followed was torturous. Soft, mournful whispers encircled me, voices from my past urging, pleading, demanding that I look. But fear kept me anchored, my gaze forward.\n\nThe climax of my torment was a message I hadn’t expected: *\"Say goodbye.\"* Panic took over. I barricaded myself in my bedroom. The night was an endless cacophony of knocks and voices. Each voice was unmistakably familiar: my long-deceased grandmother, a childhood friend I hadn't spoken to in decades, even my mother from just across the hall. They beckoned, cajoled, and sometimes angrily demanded I open the door. But dawn came, and the noise ceased.\n\nThe next morning, as I looked at my reflection, a horrifying realization dawned. I was younger. Not by a lot, but noticeably. The app's once static clock icon now moved, but counter-clockwise. As days turned into nights, my reflection revealed a steadily regressing version of me. My recent memories began to fade, replaced by recollections of my younger years.\n\nNow, the app's twisted commands dictate my life. They bind me to a cycle of terror, anticipation, and relentless regression. Desperate to break free, I've sought help, but to no avail. Everyone perceives me as the age I appear, with no recollection of the years I've lived.\n\nWith every midnight that the clock approaches, I inch closer to my birth. And as I pen this, I can't help but wonder: when the clock reaches the moment of my birth, will I simply cease to exist or will I be trapped in a loop of horrors I've already endured?"},"343":{"title":"2:47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ib2dv\/247\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"It was a dark warm night in Wyoming, my wife Lauren was asleep, and I had tucked my two children Carly and Stan into bed.  I was sitting in the living room watching tv with a glass full of rum.  It was a re-run of Two and A Half men that seems to be the only episode they are playing every time I turn on the tv.  I was sipping away at my glass when I heard a weird noise outside, sounded like a metal crowbar falling to the ground.\n \n\n I got up to make sure no one was breaking into any vehicles.  It was dark out side so I flipped on my porch light.  I still couldent see anything so i reached into my pocket for my lighter.  As I walked down my driveway which was empty because my car was in my garage, I looked at my neighbors car and it looked like a note was on the front windshield. I picked it up and read it.\n\n\n  “I will be watching you david” shocked me that my own name was on this note.  I walked over to my neighbors door.  I checked my phone and it was 2:37 In the morning I could see the light on and hear voices so I went ahead and knocked on the door.  My neighbor Dan had opened the door and asked what i needed this late.\n  I asked him if he knew anything about the note and handed it to him, he looked at it and said “FUCK! I parked my car in a no parking spot again!” confused I asked him what that had to do with the note and he showed me that it was just a parking ticket.  Confused what just happened I apologized for the inconvenience and headed back inside.\n\n\n  I sat back down with my rum.  I thought to myself I have had to much to drink. I went to turn the tv off and proceeded to pour my rum out and hop in bed.  I woke up and walked down the stairs and found the tv was still on and my glass of rum still sitting on the coffee table. \n\n I looked outside and it was still dark outside, I pulled out my phone and checked the time and it was still 2:37 in the morning.  That’s when I heard a knock on the door.  I walked over to it and opened it. There was a crowbar on the ground, I reached down and picked it up and looked around it was dead silent no one around I went back inside shut and locked my door and set the crow bar down on the table. \n\n\n I went to go into the kitchen and get a glass of cold water, as soon as I walked into the kitchen I woke up on the couch to a knock on the door, confused and hungover I saw my almost empty glass of rum on the table and the tv still on. I got up and looked at my phone it was 7:13 in the morning confused why my kids weren’t up yet I went to open the door.  When I opened it I saw 3 policeman standing on my porch.  Confused I went to ask what they were at my door for and before I could finish my sentence I was slammed to the ground and cuffed.\n My wife lauren had heard the commotion and came running down the stairs and stopped and screamed when she looked at the living room.  My arms hurt and my neck hurt from the cops elbow in my neck but I was able to glance over and saw blood all over the place and a bloody crow bar laying on the coffee table.  As they lifted me up off the ground I looked at my shirt and there was blood everywhere.  The officer told me I was under arrest for the murder of Dan my neighbor and read me my rights before hauling me off to their police car.\n  I sat there and watched as the police stood there talking to my wife, I looked over and Dans house and it was covered in crime scene tape and police everywhere.  I sat there confused I had no idea what happened.  I was then taken and booked into the station.  I asked the guard if I could have my phone call so I could call my wife, he proceeded to tell me I could not.\n\n\n  I turned around and there were three other men in the cell with me, one of them walked over I closed my eyes scared of what was about to happen when all of a sudden my hair was pulled back hard and I opened my eyes.  I  looked up and saw my daughter carly.  She said she was thirsty and I was screaming in my sleep.  Extremely confused I looked at my phone and it was 2:37.  I was hyperventilating at this point but got up to get her some water. \n\n\nI took her back upstairs and tucked her in bed and went back down stairs.  I flopped on the couch thinking about the weird dream I had just had.  i proceeded to reach for the romote and change the channel to adult swim and fell asleep I woke up to my wife curling up next to me on the couch saying she missed me in bed that night I chuckled a sigh of relief when I noticed I had drank the entire bottle of rum, realizing that the was the cause of my terrible nightmares.  My wife reached over to change the channel to the morning news. \n\n\n The headline of the morning story stated Dan Kelper had been murdered last night with a crowbar in his home, Dans wife found him beaten to death and called the police. My heart was racing at this point and I jumped up to look outside and there were poilice surrounding his home I couldent believe what was happening.  I looked back and my wife was gone I ran upstairs and she was gone and so were our kids.  I saw a note sitting on my daughters bed, I walked over and picked it up and it read “2:37”  I turned around and my wife was standing there. \n\n\n I asked her where the kids were and she said they have been at her moms house for the past 4 days I looked back at the note and flipped it over,  and there was fingerprints of blood on the back I showed my wife and explained what I dreamt of last night, she looked at me very uncomfortably and said david your scaring me, its 2:37 in the morning right now.\n"},"344":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

For instance, after a terrible car crash, you could take a pill and not have to remember it. They're even trying to make stuff to target specific memories that may have happened a long time ago. There is some debate about the ethics of this, but what those scientists may not realize is that there's already data. \n\nYou see, the ability to do what they are attempting has been around for at least twenty years or so. (Prototypes and testing may have been in the works for longer, but I don't know much about those.) It just hasn't been in the form of a pill. I know half of you will stop reading after I say this, but I'm serious: Microchips.\n\n\"Really?,\" you're thinking. \"Microchips that alter memories have been around for twenty years?\" Sounds crazy, but remember, we'd managed to travel into space decades earlier. Also, I'm sure the public is unaware of lots of technology that's out there. I'm sorry I don't know much about the origins of this in particular – it's kind of hard to track, for so many reasons. But I will tell you what I know.\n\nYou see, when that girl went to have her head scanned, they did an X-ray. There was something small tangled into her brain. Her technician friend really thought she should see a specialist, but the girl said no. The technician couldn't tell anyone anyway, as he'd used work resources after hours, plus he didn't know her well enough to risk his job.\n\nThe reason she didn't want to see a doctor was because, like most of our group, she had come to mistrust and even hate medical and mental health professionals. If we go in to someone and explain our symptoms, then we're told they're a result of a traumatic childhood and that we should work on it in therapy. If we take it a step further and mention that we think there's something inside of us causing the symptoms, we are now psychotic and should take heavy meeds. \n\nSo how did we get to the conclusion that what was in her head was a microchip? Well, it's a whole long story and I respect the group enough not to divulge too much, as it could endanger others. But basically, the tech guy took a picture the girl's X-ray to a friend who was studying to be a surgeon, who found it sufficiently weird to where she then took it to a brain surgeon she knew. In short, it appeared to be something metallic that was positioned in a way that made operating to have it removed extremely high risk. The surgeon said that unless it was causing extraordinary problems for whoever had it, he would refuse to even try to get it out.\n\nAt this point, the two original members of the group found a third person with the same symptoms and they set up the communication network we use today. As they were trying to figure out what was going on, they came across [this group](http:\/\/www.freedomfchs.com\/). Basically, they're a bunch of people that believe they have been implanted with chips that are used for surveillance and torture. I'm not going to say whether or not they're right, as I have no way of knowing that. Their stories don't exactly fit our group's symptoms, but the it set off the chain of thoughts that, in the end, led to the following theory:\n\nA highly selective network of people exists in the U.S. We don't know how big or small it is, but suspect that it isn't huge. In the early nineties, they started using a new experimental technology that possibly was an offshoot of something a network member (or members) was working on for either the government or a medical organization. They made these microchips that they would insert into the brains of children. (While two of the earliest ones we've found are in slightly varying locations on the heads, all the rest have been in approximately the same location.) \n\nWhen these chips were in place, some other technology (we haven't figured it out yet) get used to activate the chip, which then seems to redirect the brain's processing to store the memory of whatever just happened on the chip instead of in the brain. While most of us suffered severe repeated child abuse (mostly sexual), there is one person in the group who witnessed a murder. There's one other situation, too, but it's too unique to discuss here, as it might help identify the person.\n\nThe theory is that starting in the mid-2000s, the chips started failing. Whatever thought process that was supposed to lead to those memories had been getting blocked by the chip, but they started malfunctioning and instead of hiding the memories, they were released. It's like they're on a loop and demanding a ton of attention. This is what makes us feel like it's all happening again. \n\nIt might seem a bit much to think that we all have these chips because one girl had a weird X-ray, but we can't all get them. Not only are we afraid of being labeled as crazy and given inappropriate treatment (one person in the group was hospitalized on a psych ward for five months), but even if those risks weren't there, it's hard to get anyone to give us an X-ray simply because we suspect something has been implanted in our heads. One other group member got an X-ray for something else, and a similar irregularity to the first girl showed up. It's probably a good thing that her doctor was somewhat incompetent and didn't really press the issue, focusing instead on what she had originally needed the X-ray for.\n\nAs for why we have two cases outside of the U.S., we can trace both of those to America. In my case, his wife was American and they had lived in the U.S. for a little while shortly before everything that happened to me. They also regularly vacationed there. She happens to be from an area that seems to have a cluster of cases – not that we have that much data, but three of our nine cases were within a 200 mile radius of each other. That's not counting my case, which happened in another country, but probably originated in that area.\n\nI know this seems to be a lot of speculation, but I can't really share all of our evidence, as that might identify other people in our group. But the theory seems pretty solid to us, based on the information we have gathered.\n\nI wish this was where it ended: We're working on figuring it out and maybe someday the chips will stop working altogether or we'll get them removed or something. Maybe we could get this network arrested. But it gets even worse.\n\nI hate to leave you with an unfinished story yet again, but someone from the network found me earlier this month. Because what happened was so traumatic and happened so recently, I really don't feel like I can write up what happened right now. It's too exhausting. I'll get to it later today, I promise, unless I get taken again. I think I'm safe for now, though. I've been in hiding the whole time I've been writing this story, but I'm moving to a new location after posting this and answering your comments. Having said what I just did, there is a chance they'll find this post because I think they have something set up on the Internet to track certain keywords and phrases. \n\nIt might seem foolish for me to post this if this is the case, but if anything happens to me, my group is (rightly) too concerned for their own safety to risk helping me. That's why I am putting this out there. The group needs to protect itself, but someone needs to hold these guys accountable. I'll keep trying to work on it, but they already found me once and I bet they can find me again.\n\nI know most of you who did take me seriously probably just stopped believing because of the claims made in this post. I understand – I probably would dismiss it, too, if it wasn't my own experience. But if you believe me and I don't post again later today, something bad happened. I don't want to endanger the group or those close to me. My life isn't worth enough to do that. But I want to leave this story as evidence that there is a sinister network out there, that I was targeted and that they still are around and trying to track us down.\n\nHopefully I'll be able to tell you more about that this evening."},"345":{"title":"My foster sister who lived with me for about a year.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/k216z\/my_foster_sister_who_lived_with_me_for_about_a\/","flair":null,"author":"UNDEADxxBUBBLEZ","selftext":"Okay.

Seriously, if you had a police line-up, but could only see from the knees down, you’d pick my calves and feet as the cutest every time.\n\nIt’s a gift and a curse.\n\nCan’t get a girlfriend, but my lower fourth can get any guy I want.\n\nBoo-hoo, right?\n\n*Right.*\n\nAnyways, Simon brought the kitten over along with his gear.

She had a brown coat and blue eyes. *Cute.*\n\nAs usual, once Simon got the camera rolling, I strapped on my stilettos and played with Firefly. I made her run this way and that with this little wand I have that has bright feathers on the end. She would pounce for the feathers every time. \n\nThen Simon turned on the music. Same song every month. \n\nWhen Simon hits play, that means it’s showtime. \n\nI dropped the wand and walked over to Firefly.

I smiled down and shushed her as I put more and more weight on her little body.\n\nI’m not sure if the point of the stiletto slipped into her belly first, or if the first pop of a rib sounded in the room. Maybe both happened at the same time. Either way, Firefly started panicking.\n\nIt was fucking *adorable.*\n\nShe almost got out from under my foot so I had to press down with all my weight.

Small trickles leaked from both corners of her open mouth. She seemed to be having trouble breathing.\n\nI waited until I saw the life leave her eyes before I lifted my foot and kicked her off. Her flattened body slid across the tile towards the camera.\n\nSimon paid me and I headed home.\n\nThe kitten purring at my ankles right now is named Christmas.

Me (24 M) and my wife (25 W) recently bought a house from an elderly women but while we were chatting she told us something odd, \"Never open the door at 3:57 AM.\" Me and my wife did an awkward laugh but she looked dead serious.\n\n Fast forward a few years and it's my wife's 27th birthday. We invited a few friends over the night before and planned to celebrate at midnight. It's around 3:20 AM and we want to order a pizza. We are playing some board games and drinking when we hear the doorbell ring. My wife's best friend gets up to answer it and I tap ce over at the clock, 3:57 AM. I had a bad feeling in my gut but shook it off. I heard the sound of the door opening followed by a scream, a crack, and a thud. Everyone stops and rush over and what I see will haunt me forever. She was dead, her body bent in ways it should never be, blood dripping from her mouth, and she was pale almost paper white. My wife is on the floor crying at this point and while I comfort her I remember we have a ring camera! I pull out my phone and look at the app, nothing. No one was there, \"but how no one's there?\" I say to myself. Me and my wife immediately tell everyone to get out and we head back to bed but I can't fall asleep and I'm pretty sure she is awake.\n\n\nIt's the next morning and we don't talk or eat, we just head to work. 3:50 AM I stayed up then heard the stairs creaking. My wife told me she couldn't sleep and came down to check. 3:57 AM. We heard knocks followed by the sound of bones cracking, a chill went down my spine. I mustered up the courage and opened the door, there it was. 6ft tall, pale skin, it was so skinny you could see the outline of its bones, and its eyes were all black. SNAP. My wife is on the floor dead, I shut the door but forget to lock it and I immediately run to the upstairs bathroom and lock the door. \n\nI can hear the knocks and the sound of bones cracking. “Come out to make it easier for both of us!” It said to me in a deep but high pitched voice. More aggressive knocks and bone cracking i’m getting scared. “Come on just come out pleaseee??” It begged me in a child-like voice. “No.” I responded in a scared voice. “No,” was all I could say without crying. It laughed or at least I think it did. It sounded like a laugh with a cry and of course more bone cracking. It's almost 5 AM. My phone is about to die and my wife is dead. Please help me get rid of it and get out. There are no windows and I feel trapped. It's about to break the door down."},"349":{"title":"My real dark web experience","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7ek3zv\/my_real_dark_web_experience\/","flair":null,"author":"gibshampow","selftext":"My real deep web experience \nAs any other story started it was a few months ago...I’m a teen that always stayed home from school and was always on the internet I’m always curious and like to get spooked. \n\nAnd then I came across the topic of the deep web at first I thought it was fake but then as soon as I got into a bit more research into it I figured out how to download tor on my phone. I looked into the dangers and risks but I figured eh I like to take risks so I clicked from link to link on the hidden wiki, Daniels links, etc. found you know the casual stuff like drugs and weapons. I tried my best to avoid the cp and anything related to that. \n\nI found random sites that were forums about people talking about fantasy and random stories. Then at the end of the day I decided to stop and go to sleep. So then the next day when I got home from school I got this call from a random number and so I answered it anyway in case it’s an important call...and it was silence for about 5 seconds.\n\nI usually hang up the phone at this point but I kept listening and then I heard mumbling\/whispering. I was creeped out and I realized that it could be a possibility that maybe someone on the deep web is watching me... I thought to myself maybe this is a warning... I decided to stop because anyway for now. \n\nLater in few months past and I was wanting to get back on the dark web and see what new sites are up. So then I was searching on the red browsers search engine and found a messed up site like was a social network for psychos and me and my curious self I continued and made an account and I see that the time stamp was from a few weeks ago....thinking to myself wow that’s recent for the deep web... I continue to these posts on this site. \n\nPeople talking about their crave for cp and gore. I was disgusted then I clicked on the images and it was filled with dead bodies and dead children. So got off the dark web for the day. Few weeks later I get curious and go back to the site finding out that now they have a psycho version of YouTube... they don’t have very many videos but it seems to be either porn or gore. \n\nA video that I think was named a mother and a son with 1 baseball bat. I was thinking this is gotta be fake so I opened the video and started watching the video was taken by the mother and the little boy was sitting on a bed with a music box.....the Mom says “you know what you did was wrong and you need to apologize”. They kid in silence with just the music box playing sits there then gets up with a baseball bat and hit his mother on the head as the mother falls to the ground seeing the moms reaction and bruising then the kid hits her again and again until her face is disfigured. Gosh this was getting a little to far in disturbing... every swing you can hear the kid crying almost like he doesn’t mean to do this to his mother. \n\nThen finally on his last swing her head comes off with blood splattered on a white sheet on the right side off the screen. After seeing this I almost got a panic attack Because that was way too extreme...after that experience I’ve been more cautious on what I look at.

It started about 7pm and the few of us the went the distance didn't get home until after 6am the next day.\nI'm massively wishing I didn't go the distance, I'd much rather been called a pussy and left at 1 or 2am - then I wouldn't be in this fuckin mess.\n\nMy mate who was getting married came down from another state to get hitched, and most of his mates came over too.. so I don't really know his mates too well.. but I know they are in the army and can drink like motherfuckers.\nI'm not in the army, but I can drink all night and still be pretty much with it.\n\nSo back to the bucks.. lets just say our pubcrawl ended up at strip-bar which was fine, except I didn't realise one of the groomsman paid one of the strippers for sexual favours. Now I also didn't realise that this dude had been sneaking in to the pokies at all the pubs we were visiting and playing them between drinks... I also didn't know that he won a whole lot of cash that night. I'm guessing it must have been upwards of $5k.. because he paid a stripper to blow four guys in our bucks party. Now.. I know she didn't blow me.. but she did shove her tits in my face more than a few times throughout the evening.. so I went home smelling of booze and stripper perfume..\nThis is where things get fucked up. I fully got busted for getting a lapdance, because I stank like stripper skank when I got home and I admitted it.\n\nMy GF was pretty mad but after a few days seemed to get over it.. right up until tonight when she got a call by my mate's GF who said that she was told that all of the boys got BJ's at the strip-club.\nTurns out one of these army meat heads got remorse (and hopefully herpes) and spilled the beans to his missus.. but said WE ALL GOT BLOWN to make it seem like it is less of a thing if we all were in on it.. which is total bullshit.\n\nAnyway my GF didn't tell me about the call until after dinner tonight.. and she was all nice to me making me lasagna with wine.. and homemade garlic bread. She told be about the call, and I said it was a total lie, and I did not get a BJ AT ALL.. she just said it doesn't matter and went to bed and that was like 2 hours ago.. and now I'm thinking what the FUCK is going on? I'm totally stressed that she may have put something in my fucking food or something? I'm fucking looking at the knife block and there is a fucking knife missing too... it is fucking freezing outside and I have to work in 5 hours and I haven't slept and I'm in the study with a fucking mirror next to the screen so I can see behind me.\n\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI managed to get a friend to answer their phone and they are going to drive around to pick me up. I told them to park down the road and leave the boot open, because I'm bringing my full sized gaming machine with me.. and my dog, but my mate doesn't know about the dog yet.\nSigning off so I can shut the machine down and disconnect, I'll leave the screen and shit behind, that stuff is cheap to replace.\nI just need to make this shit happen quietly. I'm scared to take my eyes of this mirror, but I need to get moving, I'm losing my fucking mind here.\nAs soon as I let the dog out of the laundry he is going to go mental and make a racket.. so I'm going to go in to the laundry and close the door behind me and open the back door and leave with the computer and the dog, out the side gate and down the street with no shoes on in the fucking freezing dark.\nI'll post back from my mates granny flat if I make it out of here.\nthanks for listeneng to my crazy situation.  - RJC\n\n***SECOND UPDATE***\n\nSo made it out and I noticed my GF had the light on in the bedroom as I bolted down the street with my dog and PC.\nI got a txt from her while my mate drove me (btw he was pissed that I brought my dog with me). \nThe txt read: \"You're fucked\".. \n\nI txt back \"I DIDN'T GET A FUCKING BJ... WHY HAVE YOU GOT A KNIFE???\"\n\nGF: \"The knife is not for you asshole\"..\n\nI told my mate to stop the car... I showed him the messages and he just said \"What the fuck?\" I told him to drive back and wait in the car while I go and check on her..\n\nSo I go back and the front door was open, the bedroom light was off but I could see a light at the end of the house.. I walked in and I could hear the radio I saw the knife on the floor of the hallway so I picked it up and carried to the kitchen. GF was sitting at the kitchen table.. when I stepped into the light I could see some blood on the blade so I chucked in the sink and ran over to Marlena. She looked like she was half asleep, but she wasn't injured in any way.. I asked her what happened? where'd the blood come from? but her eyes kinda rolled back in her head and she slowly slumped forward as if she was falling asleep.\n\nI called the cops and they asked if I needed an ambo, I said I wasn't sure, but after I described the condition of my GF they said they were dispatching one.\n\nSo the ambos picked up my GF and took her to the emergency, while the cops questioned me for a while before asking me if I would come back to the cop shop. They checked all the rooms in the house to see if there were other people. I asked if I was under arrest, they said no, but they have more questions. They baggied up the knife and I took a ride with them.\nI was at the station for four hours and had to speak to four different people, I think 2 were detectives and the other was a domestic violence officer or detective. \n\nThey said that the knife was at a forensic lab and if the blood came back human, they would detain me while they search for the victim. They also said they had sent 2 officers to the hospital to talk to my GF.\nI explained the WHOLE story to them but they thought it was strange that I left the house in the middle of the night with no shoes on.\n\nAnyway, finally they said that it wasn't blood, they said it was some sort of starch. They gave me some brochures on relationship counselling and mental health, and they let me go.\n\nI tried calling my GF but someone else answered and said she couldn't talk right now. I phoned the hospital to ask about her, but they wouldn't give me any patient details over the phone.\n\nSo I felt pretty shitty when I got home and decided to pack a bag and drive to the hospital to see if I could stay the night in her room.\n\nI rang another one my mates who was at the bucks (not the dude with the car) to tell them what was going on and he was pretty shocked.. apparently one of the guys that got a BJ was getting a separation from his wife.. but because the army boys had gone home we don't really know what happened to them. I told my mate not to tell the groom about what's going on, because I didn't want it to spoil their honeymoon. I said I didn't want the bride to find out about the BJ's at the strip bar, but my mate said that she already knew and he thought everyone knew about the strip bar weeks ago???!!!??Which is fucking weird because NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE WEDDING.\n\nI got off the phone pretty confused and drove to the hospital..\nWhen I got there, they said that she had taken quite a few sleeping pills. They said the bloods were ok but she'd be drowsy for quite a while, because they didn't let her sleep for ages. They said they kept her awake for quite some time.\n\nI asked if I could stay and they said no, but I could go in to see her.\nI went in to see her and she opened her eyes when I sat down next to the bed. I didn't say much and neither did she. I said that I could't stay but she grabbed my jacket as I went to stand up and she said \"the stripper is gone\". I sort of stood there thinking what the fuck did she just say? she sat up and pushed the call button. A nurse came in and asked if everything was ok? My GF said she needed help getting up to go to the bathroom with her IV drip.\nI just said.. \"ok bye\" about turned and it's like everything is a blur. I drove home and I'm sitting here. typing this fucking essay on a fucking iPAD on the floor I'M SO FUCKED \n"},"351":{"title":"What went wrong with the great cat slaughtering","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/154dh68\/what_went_wrong_with_the_great_cat_slaughtering\/","flair":"Animal Abuse","author":"gistya","selftext":"A few weeks ago, the order came from above that 13 of our cats were to be slaughtered. Their numbers had grown without respite for a few years now, due to a lack of adequate gelding. And so the males had consistenty (and vigorously, I might add) inspermated the females, whose orifices would be dripping with cat cum as they jumped on the dinner tables and fish dissectories. \n\nAs it would happen, the main problem with this proliferation of cats turned out to be the death of several Esteemed Members on the stairways that interconnect the dormitories and cafeterias of our Last Stand. When Sigun Lazdil broke his neck on stairway 419B, it was decreed by poem:\n\n> In the hall of Esteemed, shadows grow,\n> Thirteen felines, ordained to bestow.\n> Not a sentence of hate, but necessity's flow.\n> \n> Under the moon, their silhouettes glow,\n> Life to release, for balance we owe.\n> In the dance of the world, such seeds were sow. \n> \n> Do not perceive this act as woe, \n> Each stroke of blade, a mercy to show.\n> For in their end, the beginnings we know. \n\nBy this decree the Esteemed Members of Machinecover knew that we must filet and dissect a full 13 of our ragdolls.\n\nHowever it went horribly wrong.\n\nFirstly, no one amongst the Esteemed Members was assigned to clean up the various cartilage, sinews, bones, furs, lip-tentacles (antennae?), ears, eyelashes, claws, little paws, leg pieces, muscles, cat intestines, and other aspects that remained after the actions were carried out according to the decree.\n\nInstead they were left uncovered, on the floors, in the cabins, upon the dressers, and wherever else Esteemed Members saw fit to leave them after the dismemberment had been done. Yet no Clean-Selves, Collect-Selves, or Recycle-Selves were dispatched accordingly.\n\nAs a result, a great malady descended upon the residents of Machinecover. Something came up from the depths of releality, summoned by the cat cries, and homing in on the various rotting fleshes and flayed carcasses strewn about the interiors of the Esteemed Members. \n\nFirst it was merely a shadow: clinging to the corners and sticking to the sidereal. The corneas of the residents of Machinecover indeed kept catching side-glances and flashes of its abominatory shadoweference, yet it remained undetected by the Esteemed Guard. \n\nHowever next, it became vociferous. The cries of the suffering and dying cats would echo nightly through the cavernous corridors and descending switchbacks of Machinecover. Their horrific meows and murrooowws would ceaselessly interrupt our Sleep-Selves, arresting rest and disturbing dreams. \n\nFinally, it became aggressive and quite physical. \n\nFirst to go was Minkot \"Maze\" Osednish, a purveyor of Phantom of Skulls literature, known for being a little tight with her resources.  It came to her cabin at thrice past nocturne, skimming through the crack beneath her door at the end of the culdesac off Stairway 142C. Her teeth were found and identified by Intercover officers, yet aside from the nerves dangling from their roots, no other trace of Maze ever was found. \n\nNext to go was Zefon Norammafol, an unemployed Engraver. A child delivering his supper discovered his right wrist, perfectly sectioned off like a disc of arm, balanced perfectly upon the doorknob of his commode-chamber. No blood drops, no vomit, and no teeth were found at the scene, just the wrist. \n\nAnd now I hear it at my door. I can see its thirteen legs casting shadows beneath my door-gap. I can hear its razor-sharp mandibles engraving something in my door, a skill it has absorbed from Zefon. I am waiting, in the dark."},"352":{"title":"The year I started believing in a God was the year my parents ripped me out of my childhood home and buried me under a pile of rocks in Moab, Utah.

I expected Lisa to take the lead, like she had been this whole time.  Instead, she seemed to cower to the back of our small group.  I turned to face her and noticed both Yamir and Emma had moved behind me as well.  I was our leader now.  I had made the rocks crumble and the opening appear.  Now, I had to lead us to the exit.  I had to lead us to the end. \n\nI walked through the opening and stopped a few feet in, deciding to give my eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness.   It was no use, I couldn’t see my own hands in front of me and there was a sour taste in my mouth.  It smelled like rotten eggs, like sulfur.  I could feel one of them breathing on my neck, I spun around.  I no longer saw any light from the room that we were in before, “Guys, what do we do now?”\n\nThere was no answer, I could still feel breathing on my neck and reached out to touch a body, “Yamir?”  \n\nNo answer, “Who is this?”\n\nI found their hand and squeezed it, nothing.  \nI swung my left arm out and felt another body.  It was unresponsive.  \n\nI stumbled around in the darkness and grasped the three hands belonging to my three friends who wouldn’t move or speak.\n\nIt was a joke, a sick terrible and cruel joke, “Guys!” I shouted, “This isn’t funny anymore!”\n\n“Please!” I begged, “What’s going on?”\n\n“Lisa! “ I sobbed, “Answer me!”\n\nI’m not sure how long I grasped at the three bodies, shouting, begging, and, sobbing.  At some point the silence won out and I became one of the quiet and motionless bodies.  I wanted to be wherever they were.  I thought about feeling for walls, but I felt safe in the triangle of bodies.  I stood there and the silence ate away at me.  The darkness and the silence worked together until it was drowning me.  I was breathing it in and poisoning my lungs.  It was choking me.  I began howling.\n\nThe awful, sick howling that I’d heard earlier started coming from my own twisted mouth.  My jaw began to ache and I thought violent things.  Like carving out Yamir’s heart so he could never love Lisa and slaughtering my parents so they could never argue again.  The gnashing of the teeth came from the bodies surrounding me.  They gnashed at one another and I couldn’t see them but I could hear them and I could feel them moving around me, tearing away at one another.  \n\nTheir echoes bounced off of the walls surrounding me and they yelled for a name, for a girl, for a sister, “Leslie!” they howled, “Leslie!”\n\nShe isn’t here, I thought.  “She’s never coming back,” I said and I heard it echoed back to me as the darkness finally took me with it, “Leslie,” it echoed, “she’s never coming back!\n\nI woke up in a hospital some time later.  There were IV’s sticking from my arm and I felt like my head was caved in.  The doctors surrounded me in their lab coats and they talked about me like I wasn’t there.  Words and phrases like, “severely dehydrated,” “malnourished,” and “mentally unstable,” floated around the hospital room like the big red balloons someone had left at my bedside table.  \n\nWhen my parents reported me missing, the police asked if I had been exhibiting any strange behavior.  My dad told them that he believed I’d broken into his office several times and that’s where he kept all of his work.  The police decided to have the cave my dad was working in completely searched.  They found me deep within the cave, alone, without anything on me.  I was incoherent and apparently babbling about someone named Johnny and the sacrifices he was planning.\nIn the months following, bits and pieces of what happened to me in Moab began to come together.  \n\nThere was a reason I constantly found myself mixing up the names of Leslie and Lisa.  It was all coming back as sure as the sun was setting in a sky I thought I’d never see again.  There was only ever Leslie.  My role model Leslie, my protector Leslie, my best friend Leslie, my sister Leslie.  My parents couldn’t have a kid, that’s when the tension started.  The fights began long before my father’s job was an issue.  The fights began long before Moab happened.  \n\nAnd then there was Leslie, a miracle they called her.  They explained it to me when I was younger, they said, ‘Leslie was born in our hearts, that’s why the color of her skin doesn’t match yours.’  She was adopted, but then I happened.  I was the ‘accident’ Leslie had joked once, but my parents always said that I was their ‘surprise.’  They must’ve been thrilled and hopeful; at least that’s what they’d always said.  I grew up and became another mouth to feed, another child for my mother to care for while my father was away and couldn’t.  I was loved, we were both loved, but I caused stress.  And with stress came tension, until I was sure it was all going to break. \n\n\nThere was darkness and I saw the flashing lights before I heard them.  The wailing that means there’s someone out there in pain and we need to get to them and we need to help them.  But they couldn’t help her.  They couldn’t help Leslie.  \nThe back left of our 1997 Toyota RAV4 was torn clean off when the driver of a tractor-trailer fell asleep at the wheel and plowed through the median.  I’m not sure how many times the car rolled but it stopped right side up.  I remember looking to my left and seeing nothing.  Seeing nothing was worse than seeing her dead next to me.  Seeing nothing meant she was gone for good, and I could never see her again.  \n\nThe casket was closed but that’s all I really remember about the time after her death.  My dad had been driving the car.  He was in the driver’s seat, on the left, suppose it had been the front left instead of the back left part of our car torn off?  What then?  I’m sure my mom juggled those questions a lot.\n\nThe same darkness that I experienced in the cave, that was the kind of darkness that loomed over our slightly emptier household.  There was a strange silence where Leslie’s voice should’ve been.  I remembered dealing with ignorant and mean kids growing up who would tell me that Leslie wasn’t really my sister, that a white girl could never really be my sister.   I always knew they were wrong and that it didn’t matter.  She was my sister even if she wasn’t my flesh and blood.  But when she died, I believed them.  I believed that she wasn’t my sister anymore and that was the worst darkness of all.\n\nWe would’ve moved regardless of the job offer.  It just helped that my dad already had a job lined up in the town we were moving to.  My parents hoped that it would help get rid of the pain that had a face and a name.  I hoped it would get rid of the pain too.\n\nFor that first month or so it did seem to help me block out the pain.  Mostly because I was numb to everything around me.  Apparently it isn’t good psychologically for a teenager experiencing severe emotional trauma to have no interaction with his peers.  That’s why I met Lisa.  She was my coping mechanism. \n\nMy mind didn’t fill in all of the details surrounding her because she wasn’t a real person; instead, my mind gave Lisa the attributes of Leslie with the personality and looks to match while Lisa’s sister Leslie was a completely different character my mind had created.  \n\nThe time Lisa came to my house, the therapist’s say that the conversation she had with my mom was a memory my brain had made up; most likely, it was based off a true event that had happened before Leslie died.  They say I paired the fabricated memory with the conversation I had imagined while picking the lock on my dad’s office door and rifling through his things.\n\nThey say most of the memories are like this.  There was a hotel though, but there was no Yamir.  He was a figment of my imagination as well, that’s what the therapists told me.  They believe Yamir represented my insecurities.  A few weeks after they found me in the cave, a hotel receptionist came forward and said that she’d seen me in Yamir’s hotel.  I listened to her tell the police and doctors that she’d seen me talking in a hushed voice, but no one was around me.  A few minutes after she’d seen me go in there, she called security and found that I had gone up to the roof.  She went up there, unsure of how I’d gotten in, and found me standing on the rooftop all alone during late twilight.  Since I wasn’t doing anything wrong, and she could tell I was very upset, she decided to leave me alone.\n\nEmma and Johnny were also just figments of my imagination.  People my own mind made up to add to the realistic world and storyline I was creating for myself.  There were things the police and doctors weren’t certain about; for instance, how I had gotten to the cave.  There was no evidence of anyone driving me and there was no car to suggest that I’d driven myself.  \n\nAll of this knowledge, it wasn’t something that all returned to me at once.  As I became more stable, I started to put together the bits and pieces.  I started to hold onto the information and events the doctors and police told me about.  I started to remember them as being true.  I got better, but I was still shaky on the same events no one else could piece together.  I still have no clue what really happened in that cave, just the dark and tainted memories that I do a good job of keeping out.   \n\nIt was difficult to deal with, I dreamed up realities where there really was satanic worship and I barely made it out alive.  Those dreams were easier than trying to comprehend my own insanity.  Sometimes I’d even dream that Lisa made it out alive with me, that somehow I’d rescued her and was a hero.  \n\nWe left Moab not too long after I started to forget and remember, remember and forget.  We moved to Minnesota and my dad helped advise construction on the lakes.  It was a beautiful place to live and even though we’d always mourn Leslie and hide from what happened in Moab, Minnesota helped us begin to heal.  I never witnessed my father lay a hand on my mother after Moab and I never saw nasty bruises on her face or arms after Moab.  I wondered if that was a part of what I’d imagined.  I wondered if that darkness was just in my head too.  \n\nNow here I am, sitting behind my computer, talking with you all.  The year is 2015, and it has been almost 16 years since what happened to me in Moab.  The only thing that remains the same is that I believe in God.  I believe in God because I found darkness in Utah that was so thick and tangible that it proved to me the devil exists.  You can’t have one without having the other.  Moab, Utah made me believe in the devil; because of this, Moab, Utah made me believe in God.  \n\nNow I go to church often, my church is actually where I met my wife.  I moved with her back to Baltimore a few years ago and she’s pregnant with a baby girl.  Even though that darkness is in my past, I do my best to eliminate it by filling my life with the light of my God.  That’s my coping mechanism now.  \n\nNormally, I wouldn’t have brought this to Reddit, but something happened two days before my first post that caused me to write this.  My wife was upstairs resting because she had done some cleaning while I was off at work; side note, I’m a history teacher now if that interests any of you.  I was sitting in our living room on the recliner, eating a microwave dinner.  The Orioles v. Angel’s game had just started, and I was happy to be relaxing before I had to start grading some papers.  There was a knock at the door, and I considered waiting till the commercial break to answer.  I knew that’d be too long, and I didn’t want to be rude.  Finally, I dramatically sat my recliner up right before climbing out of the pleather upholstery and crossing the few feet to the door.  I opened the door and my heart ceased to beat.\n\nThere was a man in front of me who was a spitting image of Yamir if he had been fifteen or sixteen years older.  He looked at me with warm brown eyes and said, “It’s Lisa.  She needs our help.”  \n\nI told him not to say another word and to go away or I would call the cops.  As long as he doesn’t come back, I’m not going to do anything.  This is all in my past.  My wife doesn’t even know about what happened to me in Utah.

It's too late, but I should get on with the story.\nSo anyways, it turns out I wasn't the only one who decided to relive the show. My friends actually started watching it again shortly before \"Day of the Doctor\" was released. \"So we won't forget a single moment\", they said, but I digress. One of my friends, Alex, is practically the \"Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen\" of Doctor Who, in other words, #1 fan. He asked me to draw a Weeping Angel so he could use it as a prank on his little brother or something like that, and I was the known cartoonist\/artist of the group. At first I refused because,frankly, I wouldn't even be able to look at the thing without shivering, but after some persuasion (and free lunch) I gave in. \n\nI went back to my grandparents' house. I'm staying with them until my parents get back from that cruise they went to in 2011, and they're still not back. They can't be dead though, no newspaper headlines stating that the ship sank, nor any phone calls from the police.....but I digress. Anyhoo, as soon as I got finished from that essay, I decided I would get started on my Weeping Angel, because I did NOT want to fry my brain with that quiz (college life can be so hard). Let me mention before-hand that my grandparents have a garden with a fountain and a statue and everything, and now everything I am about to tell you will make sense. I went on Google images, got out a Weeping Angel and my sketch book, and began to draw. I began with the head, and when I got done with that and started on the eyes, I started shivering. For absolutely no reason. Until I looked outside the window.Wasn't there a statue over at the fountain? I don't remember it being right next to the flower pot. These thoughts went through my head as I stared at the back of a statue that had apparently moved. I went back to the Weeping Angel sketch but it.....changed.What was supposed to be a close up sketch of a Weeping Angel was now a sketch of the statue outside. Now listen here when I tell you readers out there when I tell you that I wasn't like those idiots in the horror movies when they just brush off that strange occurrence and realize their mistake too late, no sir. I just GTFO.\n\n\n Exactly what I did.\n\n\n\n Noped right out of there.\n\n Fortunately, my grandparents were out on a trip to Venice and I had the house to myself, so no danger there. The real danger was in the blinking. The \"moving-around-without-taking-your-eyes-off-that-thing\" thing.*That* is where the real danger resides.\nI just kept my eyes on that statue. Just stared at that statue for so long I hadn't even noticed that the sketched statue was turned around facing me.\n"},"355":{"title":"Tried Three Kings...here's what happened to me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/whob8\/tried_three_kingsheres_what_happened_to_me\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"So, like many other redditors, I was intrigued by the Three Kings post from a few days ago. However, the ensuing flood of posts by fellow redditors is what really got me interested in trying this out. I consider myself pretty rational and skeptical by nature, but all these other posts kept gnawing at my curiosity. I finally decided to try the Three Kings for myself last night, if nothing else than to satiate my own need to know for certain if it was in fact real or not. Here's what happened...\n\nI followed the set up outlined in the original post pretty faithfully. The only difference was that I did not have a fan. Our house has a nice basement, pitch black without the lights and no windows, so I think it was perfect for this. It being summer, most of my roommates have gone home for the break. (I share a five bedroom house off campus with four other students from my university) Luckily, one of my roommates is still here. For the sake of ease, let's call him Stu. Stu was already planning to stay up and play COD for a while so he agreed to be my failsafe. My \"power object\" was a stuffed teddy bear I had received for my birthday last year from my ex. Yeah, maybe it wasn't the best power object, but I didn't have anything better.\n\nI went to bed as it says in the instructions with my alarm set for 3:30AM. I woke up at 3:29 on my own, didn't even need the alarm after all. I guess I was really psyched for this. I went down to the room, and noticed the door was closed. At first, this gave me a little chill and for a moment I thought \"Shit, maybe it's real after all...\". I walked over to the living room real quick and asked Stu, who was busy fragging some newbs on COD, if he had closed the door. Stu...well stu likes to hit the bong...and he was a little stoned by this point, it took him a second, and then he was like \"Oh, shit dude...sorry...I forgot that you left it open on purpose.\" False Alarm.\n\nSo, after reminding Stu to come get me at the appointed time, I went back into the room and sat down in the \"throne\", making sure not to look into either mirror. I'll admit it's a little creepy. Sitting in a dark room, the only light coming from your flickering candle, flanked by two mirrors that you can just only see in your peripheral vision. It's creepy. Five minutes passed and nothing happened. Then ten minutes, then fifteen minutes...NOTHING HAPPENED. Then I started getting sleepy (it was 3:50 something after all). I don't know when I fell asleep, but at some point I nodded off right there on the throne. When I woke up,...it was already daylight. I had apparently spent the night sleeping on the floor next to my \"throne\". What a joke. Fucking Stu and his lazy stoner ass forgot to get me. I walk out into the living room and there he is, passed out on the couch, bong on the coffee table, xbox controller in his lap. Lucky for me the Three Kings was a bust, if some real exorcist shit had gone down I would have been screwed. Haha. \n\nBut, seriously...to anyone out there who was like me reading these posts and wondering...if just maybe there was some truth to this thing. Just do it. You'll always have that nagging doubt until you do it. No need for any of the failsafes or a friend because it's not real. Just wake up at 3:30, walk on down and sit on the throne. And you know what....just go ahead and stare right into the left mirror. Because there's nothing there. Just do it. Do it tonight.

He was charming, but the drinks he keep on buying me started getting me drunk. My friends apologized for me and took me home. We had each other number when I left.\n\nA week later, he called me and asked me out. We went to a nice restaurant, and he was more charming than last time.

You see, lately the USA has become known as a country filled with fat, stupid people, and as a proud, wholesome man who loves where he lives, this is troubling to me. So I took it upon myself to get rid of this stereotype one person, and one state, at a time. This may scare many of you if you happen to be a bad kind of person. \n\nI started in Mississippi. Odell Smith was what most people thought of in Mississippians: he was a wifebeater, a slob, and a racist. He got a taste of his own medicine when I lynched him the way he'd lynched the blacks 40 years ago. Sure, he was an older man, but he was still deserving of death. I hung him up and set his obese wriggling body on fire until it was a charred, smoky corpse. \n\nIt was a pleasure doing this. I was able to satisfy my deep, dark desires and improve America's image. I went on to Houston, Texas, and employed a Mexican man, Hector Rios, to work for me. It was his illegal scum that was souring good old Texas's image, so once I had him alone in my garden, explaining what I wanted him to do, I grabbed the garden shears and drove them right through his skull. I buried his body under my flower bed, sold the house, and moved on. \n\nIn Miami, Florida, I picked up Maria, a sexy young Cuban girl who had taken to prostitution. Once I had her alone in my car, I strangled her with her own belt. Then, in Connecticut, I abducted snobbish, obnoxious 14-year-old Amber Whitaker, the spoiled and idiotic daughter of a wealthy lawyer, from the Bridgeport mall. Back at my place, I shot her and dumped the corpse far out in the Atlantic. After her, I killed Gino Morretti, who was stereotypical of the \"Jersey trash\" you'd see on the Jersey shore. \n\nI don't want to bore you with details, redditors, but I think you'd be interested to know that my next few stops included Oklahoma (where I killed a nutty religious homophobic mother abusing her gay son), Kansas (where I killed a Methodist pastor who spent too much time collecting money and not enough practicing what he preached), and Alabama (where I killed a Ku Klux Klan member). \n\nYou can thank me, my fellow Americans, for helping rid the nastiest stereotypes of the US. But so far, I've only got eight states down. Just wanted to let those of you here from Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Connecticut, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Alabama know that I've helped rid your (lovely) states of at least one undesirable, and to give those of you who have tarnished the reputations of other great American states a warning, because I'm coming for you. \n\nNo one has thought of linking these murders together yet, especially since half of these victims were never even reported missing. And like I said, if you're in one of those \"other\" states, you'd better watch out. \n\nSo long, reddit. \n\n-Uncle Sam.

I used to buy collectible items like coins and stuff. Well one day I was browsing around craigslist when I saw a really good deal on a 1901 coin. My first instinct was of course to buy it so I looked it over and it seemed like the real deal (note-some coins are fake). I emailed the guy about the offer and eventually he emailed me back. In the email he didn't really talk about the coin but I just put off and emailed him about the coin again. This time he actually talked about the coin and he sent me some more pictures of it.\n\n\n\nA couple days later after close consideration I decided to buy the coin so I emailed him and asked where we could meet. He said he worked days and he got off at 9:00 pm and it takes about an hour to get home so I said I would wait his house until he got home and make the deal. He said that was a good idea so we decided I should stop by tomorrow. \n\n\n\nThe next day I ate dinner at around 8:45 and then left because it would take me about an hour to get there. (note-the guy lives away from the city in a pretty remote area.) When I got there I grabbed my 15 dollars and waited for him to get there. While I was waiting my car battery died and started to feel pretty sleepy. I tried my best to stay awake but just as I was about to pass out I saw headlights in the distance. I looked at my watch and it was 10:00 pm.\n\n\nThe car pulled into the house's driveway and a middle aged looking guy with glasses and long hair got out of the car. I got out of my car and asked if he was ready to make the deal. He said yes and told me to come in his house. I told him it would be quicker if he just brought the coin out here but he insisted I went in. I finally just agreed with him and went inside. His house looked like something from the early 1900's. It was only 1 story and made of old bricks. When we got in it smelled like thousands of dead animals in one room. We sat down in the kitchen and talked. After 2 minutes of talking I asked about the coin.He said he has it in his room and he went to go get it.\n\n\nWhile I sat there I was sure I heard voices coming from the door next to the chair I was sitting in. When the guy got back I asked him about it and he said it was just his radio playing in the basement. I payed him the 15 dollars but he said he needed more. I told him  I did not bring any more money and that he said it would only be 15 dollars. He got very angry and he hit the table very hard. I quickly grabbed the coin and ran outside to my car. I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to start but I remembered the battery was dead. The guy came running out of his house with a gun and shot my window. He reached for the lock but I smacked his hand away. That's when I blacked out.\n\n\n\nI woke up in a room filled with chains and other weapons. There were two other people in there missing limbs and covered in blood. I freaked out and tried to get up but I was tied up. Lucky for me there was a piece of glass next to me and one of my hands were loosely tied up so I grabbed it and cut my tied hand free. I cut the rope around my legs and got up. I grabbed a gun from the table and went upstairs. The guy was asleep so I didn't have to use the weapon. I sneaked around the house to find a phone and eventually found one and dialed 9-1-1.\n\n\nWhen the cops got there they arrested the main and said he was a wanted criminal. They unlocked the chained up people and took them to the hospital. I got a ride from the cop back to my house and I went to sleep. \n\n\nNow three years later i'm writing this story because the guy is about to get out of jail because he claimed it was his friends house and he didn't know and some how the judge believed him. The guy gets out of jail on March 1st of 2018. I already got an email from an unknown person telling me to watch my back.

Family means everything. Jobs, friends, and good and bad fortune all come and go, but family, that remains constant. I love my family with all my heart. We don’t have much but what we have we share and try to make the best of. This vacation is nothing special, just a long meandering car ride to a beautiful little cottage lent to me for the week by an old friend.\n\nSome families yacht across the Mediterranean or take in the sites of Paris or Berlin. Us? We drive, we laugh, and we thank our lucky stars for what we have. Others may have more in riches, but we are billionaires when it comes to love. Sounds corny, I know that—but deep down it’s not corny. It’s wonderful.\n\nWhen the trip began we were flush with anticipation and excitement, and perhaps a bit of fear. Not scary chainsaw fear but the innocuous fear of the unknown. What will we experience while we were out on the road far from the comforts of our backyard barbeques and television-sofa extravaganzas? Anything could happen to anyone when they stray from their comfortable environs. A drunk driver could plow into us as we drive through the murky night, a lightning strike could burn us alive, or a tornado could topple the car. We took these useless thoughts and buried them like pirate’s treasure—far from our conscious minds. Yet still they lurked under the surface, like barbs on a rose’s stem.\n\nAllow me to take a moment to tell you about my small but lovely family. There is my wife Jane, a school teacher all 31 years of close-knit community and Sunday school lecturing. She’s one-of-a-kind, Jane is. Thick, shoulder length brown hair, wavy not curly, and bright, big eyes that seemed to suck the very soul from my being when we met lo those many years ago. Her lips, like two plump loveseats pushed together on her smooth-skinned face, like two rabbits pouncing upon a dewy meadow.\n\nMy wife, she’s a serious one, but not lacking whimsy. In fact, the funniest thing I ever heard in my entire life she said to me when we first began dating. I would share it with you but the setup is way too convoluted. Suffice it to say, she has a great sense of humor and a darting keen sense of self—two things that attracted me to her immediately.\n\nMy son is named Marty. I know, I know, don’t get me started, but it was Jane’s dad’s name and what was I going to say? As previously mentioned, he is all of ten years old but he’s as wise as a sage on a hill in Tibet arranging colored sand into the shape of SpongeBob Squarepants. He has his mother’s hair and it sits on his head like a deserted bird nest perched upon two boney shoulders. Is he funny? Yes, more like me than his mom. He has a dry wit, as they say. He sometimes reminds me of a fetus version of Bob Newhart. In fact, he looked a little like him when he was an infant. Bald, serious, and pale.\n\nChild number two is Jane Jr. I decided that gem of a name. After all, my mother’s name was Gertrude and there was no way in hell that I would curse a daughter of mine with such a name. Yikes. I picked Jane simply because I figured that if she grew into half the woman her mother is she’d be all-damn-right. I love both my girls equally. We call her JJ these days. Mostly to cut down on confusion as we holler each other’s names back and forth like war chants on an Apache battlefield. \n\nSo we drove and we drove, and we spied with our little eyes, and we guffawed like a gaggle of laughing-gassed geese. Things were going swimmingly. We drove further and further towards our cottage for the week and we couldn’t wait to get there.\n\nAfter the first full day of driving, north, straight toward our destination, we decided to pull into a roadside motel in order to sleep away the tiresome day and get recharged for the remainder of our trip. We finally found a place with a flickering neon sign that promised “Color TV” and occupancies. Together we all cheered and pulled over, as I slipped my credit card from my tight billfold and we barreled into the large room.\n\nOnce inside we teetered like zombies until we were tight under the sheets and blankets. There was a round of kisses and one by one we drifted off to sleep. Morning came like the blink of an eye, coffee was drunk, cheese Danishes eaten and we were in the car like four little Indians back on the warpath.\n\nI have never minded a long drive, but this one seemed a tad different. I kept checking the map, and although roadside markers seemed aloof, I knew I was headed in the right direction. We’d get there eventually, I was sure of it. Yet this drive seemed to last longer than most others, and on the second day of full-on gas-guzzling combustion-engine gargling, my family began to drop off to sleep one by one like three tender raindrops falling from a cloud.\n\nAs the sun began to touch the tips of the tree tops, I looked over to my wife in the passenger seat. She sat there in suspended animation as if on a long space journey.  Her lower lip was slightly detached from her upper, leaving a moist and sexy strand of saliva between the two. My children were equally as unconscious in the back seat, a plastic sandwich bag of Gold Fish crackers between them, and their heads in opposite directions like two drunken scarecrows on an angry autumn evening.\n\nI swallowed the last of my gritty coffee as the sun fell just below the trees. The lighting in the car went from a golden yellow to moody blue in an instant. \n\nHell, I might as well drive through the night, I figured.\n\nIf I did, we could be at the cabin before the wife and kids awoke and I would be deemed king for a day—day after, actually, for I assumed I would need at least a good eight hours of restful sleep before I would be able to join my family in their cabin-by-the-lake festivities. What’s a loving husband to do if not take one for the team? I pressed down on the gas pedal as the darkened green trees beside me morphed into olive drab wallpaper.\n\nIt wasn’t long after the sun set that before me arose a conundrum. There was a fork in the road! I gazed over to my wife. She was sleeping soundly, but she was the one manning the map; the navigator, if you will. I decided to let her sleep and made a choice. I gunned the gas and swerved left.\n\nI was pretty darn sure that we were heading in the right direction. If I wasn’t I would have awoken her from her slumber. No big deal, we were still heading north. Even if I made a mistake with regards to the fork, it’d eventually work its self out, I surmised. As long as I didn’t do anything stupid like pull a U-turn, we’d be alright.\n\nI felt comfortable on this road, nothing seemed out of place. To begin with the scenery stayed mainly the same, so I reassured myself that I had made the right decision in regard to the fork. It was only after ten or so miles that I began to think that maybe I had chosen incorrectly. I saw a farmhouse out of the windshield. Usually this wouldn’t have registered, except for the fact that as I gazed upon it I began to feel chills. They crawled up my spine from my lower back to the top of my head.\n\nI cannot say what it was about the structure that frightened me, but it did. All I know is that the feeling was real, it was genuine, visceral. For a split second I saw in my mind’s eye a factory inside this farmhouse—a factory of some sort. White Formica wall tiles, stainless steel boxes that housed electronics. What? What was I thinking?\n\nI saw infants in pens…as pigs are kept. I saw filthy hoses attached to their mouths. Hoses like deteriorating garden hoses. The babies wriggled and moaned in their pens. I heard the sounds and I smelled the smells of the place as if I was standing inside it. I shook my head from side to side to dissipate these degrading images—and it worked! There was nothing there but a quaint farmhouse shroud by a dusky mist. I watched it whiz by the window as I caught my breath.\n\nMy foot squarely on the gas pedal, I stared through the windshield attempting to figure out what the heck was going on. As I did the evening gently sunk back into normalcy. I was a father and my family slumbered beside and behind me. Then night grew dramatically darker—as happens after dusk.\n \nAt that very moment a flock of birds—or bats—emerged from the darkness, swept over the hood of the car and up and over the roof like a torrent of black water. My foot pulled off the gas reflexively and I was about to plunge the breaks as the things cleared the back end of the car and continued their flight into the darkness behind me. I shook like a palm tree in a wind storm, but steadied myself, kept the car on the road and, thanked my lucky stars that a crash was averted.\n \nI was frightened, I admit it. My entire body was shaken, but I continued to drive, glancing every few seconds towards my sleeping wife in the passenger seat. I had been on the verge of waking her, but I composed myself and continued on our journey. I didn’t want to bother her. After all, she needed this vacation as much as I did. So did the kids. I wiped my forehead with the back of my hand and continued on. We all needed this vacation. This I knew for sure.\n\nI drove many untold miles, my head eventually winding down with the last of the caffeine buzz, as on I journeyed. Oh, my family would be so happy when they awoke to find themselves in front of the cabin. The night turned darker each time a cloud floated by the moon. I cracked the window to get some air. At first it was pleasant, wet, dewy, grassy, the smell of woodlands at night—delicious in its own unique way. Smells often trigger memories and I quickly remembered my many days and nights at summer camp when I was a child. My mind flickered with images of totem poles and daylong games of Color Wars. I smiled widely and chuckled out loud.\n\nWhat fun those early childhood days had been for me! I was a boy not from a quaint little town but from a teeming metropolis, and I was getting a chance to commune with nature. Wonderful, cheery, green-graced nature! It was right about then, in the midst of these great old memories, that I gazed up the road and realized I was confronted by another fork! I slowed down and again made the sole bold choice. It was soon after that my mood changed.\n\nI was immediately afraid I had made the wrong decision. The woods were definitely no longer sweet smelling and comfortable. They were turning, slowly, like a decaying corpse, into a different type of landscape. In front of my eyes I saw the land go from natural and wondrous to unfamiliar and frightening. The once sweet aroma that drifted through the cracked window changed and before long grew pungent and unbearable. The smell reminded me of rotting fruit forgotten on a kitchen table and covered in a dull fungal velvet.\n\nIn was then that my mind’s eye seemed to blink. When my eyes again registered the trees they had become dead sticks jutting from scarred and desolate hills. They then morphed into crosses, weathered man-made crosses planted for miles around me, each one waiting for a degenerate soul to be crucified upon. The moonlight shone through the once unthreatening mist creating a yellow fog that crawled between these accursed appendages. In and out of the crosses this yellow ooze undulated, like a river rotten with rancid corpses.\n\nOn I drove, like a man on a mission. Or like a junkie, a heroin junkie, who had set his sights on a ghetto street corner and the dealer who lurked there. The moon began to grow brighter and I assumed a cloud had cleared its moonlight path, yet when I looked at it through the acorn and mosquito pock-marked windshield, I saw that it had grown brighter of its own accord. I saw the moon wiggle as a distant landscape seems to do on a hazy summer day. The moon shifted in the sky slightly and on its surface I saw a silhouette. I couldn’t immediately make out the shape, but soon I saw it. I saw it clear as day: there was a face on the moon.\n\nThis was no cheery black & white Honeymooners-sitcom man in the moon. Oh no, it was a piss yellow violent and rancid face with huge blinking bloodshot eyes and a slightly upturned smile that exposed two entire rows of brittle and off-white cylindrically shaped sharp teeth. My heart almost burst from my chest cavity, it began beating so fast and hard that the steering wheel shook violently in my hands. Where was I? Who was I? No answers came, just sadness. Sadness and depression, an avalanche of misery fell down from that face upon my shoulders. I was very close to driving right off the road. \n\nThen the face noticed me! I was sure of it. It gazed down through the windshield at me, my wife and children—and began to laugh. First, it was a low giggle, before long it was a deafening roar, a guffaw. My brain was battered by the decibels of the laughing full moon—but my family didn’t flinch. They remained sleeping during the entire terrifying episode.\n\nThings didn’t get any better from there. In fact, when I looked at the road in front of me, I saw with no apparent deceit, a long and winding river of shit—a gurgling, disgusting brown fecal fjord stretching to the horizon. In the distance I could see a giant mountain with metal pipes jutting from its face, and attached to those pipes were dirty eggshell white porcelain toilet bowls, and on those toilet bowls were innumerable human beings, faces grimacing and releasing their bowels.\n\nA mountain of shit-taking almost-corpses, prisoner of war camp refugees excreting their bowels as the moon howled. It was exactly then that I felt my car turn into a prison cell. The roof lowered immeasurably, and the two side doors seemed to cave in on me. I was being crushed by the weight of the roaring metal and I knew not what to do. I felt like a death row prisoner, long-lost of poetry and fables, but praying for the sin-eating governor’s reprieve to come at any moment.\n\nThe entire night turned into a dragon’s tail, a long meandering scaly whip that thrashed at my very being. The night became a terrorist turncoat, a friend who eventually stabs my back, twisting and turning the knife’s blade in a crescendo of murder and mayhem. Where and when did it all turn bad? Where on this journey had a made a wrong turn? The forks! The forks dug into my eye sockets like rusted Swiss army knives from long forgotten childhoods. Like frogs dangling on strings by hick hooligans throwing home-made Chinese stars at them, I was now a victim of whatever fantastic phantasmagoria managed to rip through the veil.\n\nAnd the veil wasn’t merely torn; it was shred to bits.\n\nThe car began to slow even though I was stepping on the gas pedal. It was as if I was no longer in control of anything. Obviously, this was not surprising to me as I was fast slipping into crazy land. My mind was torn asunder, my reality was being sliced and diced and I was unable to stop it. I gazed out the driver’s side window and noticed the road beside me. It began to encircle the car. Not the road exactly but the dirt, the leaves, the soil, and larval creatures began to crawl from the depths of hidden holes. Giant worms and beetles, their black shiny shells reflecting the raucous moonlight emerged slowly at first, then faster. From lower levels rabid beasts ascended.\n\nThe car was encircled by these creatures, tentacles and pincers, hairy arms and bulbous eyes, and the gurgling—that damned gurgling. The foul language of whatever had encircled me was getting louder and beginning to erase my thoughts, mashing my memories one by one. It was banging, banging on the car as if I was inside a riot. It was ripping the doors off with the Jaws of Life as if I were an accident victim. It was a cacophonous roe to gain access. There was a legion of crippled midgets and armless children wriggling in the mud surrounding the vehicle. I gazed upon these monstrous visions as my family slept like comfortable logs.\n\nI clenched my eyes tight and pounded on the gas pedal. The car once again picked up speed and we traveled headlong along the ribbon of the road until another fork arose. Without contemplation I tore right and the sky blackened as the car was enveloped in a thousand flapping leathery bat wings. Through the ink-black clouds hail began to fall, cracking onto the hood of the car like stones being tossed by a Bigfoot clan.\n\nMy mind beat like the thrashing of a nail-encrusted cat-o-nine-tails on a prophet’s back, forming long deep lines of crimson on the inside of my skull cap. The flapping bat wings jelled together, quickly becoming one giant pair. They clapped closed one final time and then opened wide with a torrent of fetid rain water that splashed and gushed upon the windshield. I could no longer see a thing…\n\nLike a sheet of black silk cloth, the water dripped down the glass. As the window cleared I saw it. There in front of the car was the cottage, my friend’s summer home, the dwelling that we drove toward this entire long demented night! As the last of the water dripped from the windshield, the crack of dawn slipped from the horizon, filling the morning with a pinkish hue. We had arrived.\n\nI looked at my wife still asleep next to me. I heard her clear her throat—a wonderful human sound, seemingly innocuous but sounding to me like the opening bars of a symphony. Two birds whistled off to my right. As I turned my head to spy them, my wife rubbed her tired eyes and began to smile. I knew she had to be as famished as I was, but surprisingly she wasn’t.\n\nWhen I pointed towards the pile of fresh meat on the backseat I assumed she would be happy with the time and care I had taken with the filet knife. She was not.\n\nMaybe she’ll change her mind if I offer her a fork?\n\n\n"},"364":{"title":"You have to help. Everyone has to help. My own riddle post needs to be solved or.

It’s two thirty-two in the morning, but when you gotta go, you gotta go.  Alberto closes the bathroom door and locks it before doing his business.  Even though he’s a 29-year-old bachelor, old habits die hard.  \n\nAlberto finishes his business and is about to flush when he feels a strange pang of fear.  There’s no reason he should be scared, this is his house, all the doors and windows are locked, he’s utterly alone…there’s no REASON, he tells himself.\n\nHe looks slowly to the bathroom door, securely battened down against…well, against nothing, really.  Shrugging, he reaches towards the handle when he hears something that makes him stay his hand.  A kind of creak.  The house settling.  The wind blowing against the door.  A tree branch rubbing against the side of his house.  \n\nA footstep.  \n\nAlberto comes to his senses, realizing that he’s been standing with his hand on the toilet handle for five minutes or so.  Slowly he withdraws his hand and joins it with its sibling, absentmindedly writhing the two together like lovers.  He listens again, but all he can hear is his own heartbeat.  Not a breath of wind.  He runs to the window, but of course it’s black as pitch.  \n\nAlberto groans inwardly at himself, and grabs the toilet handle.  “If I’m going to do it, then I’ll just do it, and damn the torpedoes,” he mutters.  Flush goes the toilet and Alberto braces himself for…something, but the house remains silent, apprehensive.  Alberto laughs aloud to himself at his foolishness.\n\nAnd hears the noise again.\n\nAlberto’s laugh stops dead, but his mouth still hangs open in surprise.  His eyes widen.  “Did that sound come from the hallway?” he asks himself.  “The acoustics in this house are shit.  I can’t tell.  God.  God.  Probably not.  That’s stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.”  He walks to the door and leans his ear against it.  The sound of his own breathing? Or…\n\n“It’s my own breathing.  Obviously.  I mean, the house is all locked up.  I’m alone in here.  No way in, right?  It was just me. \n\nObviously.”\n \nAlberto withdraws his ear.  The toilet is still gurgling as it always does after a flush.  “Since nothing is wrong, I’ll wash my hands,” he thinks.  “Yep, just wash my hands and head on back to bed.”  His hands shake as he reaches for the faucets.  But before his hands can complete their mission, he hears the faint creak again.  Unlike the other incidents, however, this creak is accompanied by the door handle to the bathroom moving.  Maybe.  Since the handle is a shiny bronze sphere, it’s really quite hard to see it moving.  It probably isn’t.\n\nAlberto locks his eyes on the door handle.  Almost imperceptibly, it moves.  \n\nAlberto freezes, staring.  Yeah, it’s moving. “The door in the wood is warping.  Hell, stranger things have happened,” whispers Alberto.  However, the water still isn’t running.  Alberto’s hands have the faucets in a death-grip.  If it had a throat, it’d be strangling.  Stupid thought.  Shakes his head.  Turns on the water.  And he hears\n\nHours later.  Alberto wakes up.  The water’s still running.  Hell of a water bill I’m racking up.  The window.  Still dark.  No watch.  Don’t know the time.  Can’t wait it out.  Stands up.  Falls.  Stands up again.  Door shut, handle stationary.  Just like normal.  Shit, I’m shaking.  I’m just cold.  The creak again, louder than ever.  Right outside the door.  And the…other sound.  No doubt now.  Walks.  Hand on the doorknob.  I’m going back to bed and sleeping and while I’m asleep I’ll dream of that girlIkissedinhighschooltheonewiththeblackhairandgreeneyeslikeacatorsomethingandilljustkissherkissherkissher\n\n“STOP!” Alberto screams.  “I HEARD THE HOUSE SETTLING AND GOT A BIT NERVOUS.  NOW I AM GOING TO BED.”\n\nHis shout echoes through the house, fading away.  The house eats it.\n\nAlberto grabs the doorknob and turns it.  Not too slow, not too fast.  The lock clicks open at the exact same volume that it always clicks.  He opens the door.\n\nA month later, the police investigate a report from the water company claiming that the resident of 13 Pentwater Avenue hasn’t paid his water bill and isn’t answering the phone or the doors.  All they find is the bathroom door open and the bathroom sink overflowing.\n"},"366":{"title":"Hello, I am a Syria soldier asking assylum in Europe or America.

Before I die,  someone must hear my story. \n\nI am a soldier from Syria. My brother died at the hands of Al-Assad’s barrel bombs. He was only thirteen. Until this time, I have been fighting. Many of my friends have died. It is very sad. \n\nFor all of the sadness, we are losing. I know we are losing. My commander does his best to keep our spirits up, but every day one of my comrades loses a limb. We pay every day for this war in fingers and ears, and even until now we are not winning. \n\nWe fight the regime, we fight Al-Nursa, we fight Al-Qaeda, we fight Da3sh. We fight each other sometimes too, if food runs low. Every day I pray to Allah that one day the fighting can be over and we can be peace again. \n\nAllah did not answer us. But around one year ago, something else did. \n\nOne day in our camp, a man came to our camp. He was a young Syrian man wearing American clothes, and nothing about him was special.  I don’t know how he managed to get to our door without the guards shooting him, but he did. He talked to us of his leader. I don’t know how to translate his name, I cannot find the word in English. The best I can do is “The Weeping Man”.\n\nWe laughed at this messenger. It is a stupid name, and we told the messenger this. He only smiled at us. This was also strange.   He said, “The Weeping Man has heard your prayers. And he will answer. Come to the police station in three days and you will receive peace. ”\n\nOf course we said no. We told him to leave our camp. He then pointed at our camp doctor, Doctor Achmed. “Come to the police station in three days, or else the Weeping Man will take his teeth”\n\nOur scout Chaled took out his gun and shot this man as soon as he finished.  He used to work at a hospital in Homs, and he fought with us for over two years.  Very little makes him afraid. He said to me, “I am not afraid of this messenger, or this Weeping Man. Let this dog to try take my teeth!”\n\nThree days passed. In the night, Dr. Achmed screamed for us. We ran and found blood all over his tent. \n\nThey were gone. All of his teeth, they were gone. \n\nHe could not speak well since his teeth were missing, so he wrote down for us what happened. In the night, a group of men came into his tent and put something in his throat to keep him from speaking. They ripped his teeth out, one a time with something of metal—I don’t know how to say in English. Doctor Achmed's teeth came out of his mouth like carrots from a garden, and they left his tent with them, making no noise. \n\nAfter this, we did as we were told and went to the police station to see the Weeping Man. Allah forgive me for this, I wish on the soul of my brother that I had not.  \n\nThat is all I can say, It takes me a long time to write in English and I cannot stay in one place for long.

However, after observing timelines after timelines shifting due entities or individuals attempting to send information about the future, there timelines have shifted so much many had even reached the divergence threshold of 1e-20% divergence shift.\n\nOne example of this is from Case No. 1022 which was a Class 4 divergence. An individual from 100 years into the future had warned his predecessor of an eminent war that was bound to happen in 10 years time in the future from that specific time point. There, he disclosed information on how the war will start and how it will be avoided. Indeed the war has been avoided. However, the individual who invented the concept that became the foundations of sending information back in time failed to be born. In addition to that, several individuals who are responsible for the technological, social and political reforms of the former timeline failed to exist in that timeline to. As a result, coupled with social problems brought by overpopulation and stagnation, the residents of that world line became extinct after a plague (which was avoided in the previous timeline due to advances made during the social reforms that took place 40 years after the war), a supervolcanic eruption and a meteor impact (which in the previous timeline has been struck by a space debris causing the asteroid to change course) struck the residents of that planet.\n\nCase No. 1022 shifted 1e-15% divergence from the original timeline.\n\nAccording to the SG Law, if one from the future would say anything about the future of that same timeline, the butterfly effect would then be activated thus changing the outcome of the world line. Every changes in the world line ranging from 1e-21 and below are divergence shifts that causes some changes in the timeline but not serious. However, world line shifts ranging from 1e-20% to 100% divergence shift, are what we call serious shifts. To give you all the idea of how much change 1e-20% divergence, imagine 2018 after Hitler became a painter, or Stalin dissolving the Soviet Union in 1945. On the other hand, for 1e-19% divergence, imagine 2018 where the Spanish Armada had successfully beaten the British Navy and Britain becomes a protectorate of Spain, or the person you know on this timeline as Genghis Khan was not born as a Mongol but as the crowned prince of the Chinese Empire.\n\nA warning to all: Never ever disclose or send any information to the past as it risks shifting the world line from one to another. It may cause a 1% divergence in the world line. According to the SG Law from Timeline No. ffhnbbjj32dn32o32655d23d_ , a world line that has diverged from the original timeline by 1%, the changes in the universe would be so great even quantum computers from 2036 would require 1 trillion trillion years to even create atleast 1 scenario for a time span of 8.457239e+50 planck time - in your concept of time, that would be ~1.4458 years (that is how long our year in our time concept is by the way).\n\nTo give you a gross estimation of how powerful our computers are, imagine all the processing power this world line has and multiply that by 1 billion and that is the processing power we are talking about here. \n\nAgain, never ever attempt to send any information back in time as it may cause a massive shift in the world line. \n\nYou have been warned.

We had gone out to a late movie and were thinking of going to a club but I was arguing I didn't want to be dead at work the next day. Yes I work on Saturdays and I have to go in at 5am. :c  Anyway as we were on the highway I spotted a billboard advertising for \"Lucifer Lighting.\" \n\nWhich just struck me as so stupid, I pointed it out to my friends.  What kind of idiot names their company that? Alot of people here where I live are very conservative and religious.  I went into a rant about how stupid that name was, how the business is probably going to go broke or its a drug front.  To which my friends told me to shut up. LOL\n\nI went to work the next day, and if you've ever worked the early early shift you know how it goes.  There was maybe ten of us on the entire floor of the building, alot of the lights were off in certain areas.  I was browsing the internet while texting since my boss didn't get in until 8am. :D Thats called productivity people!  Anyway my phone rang and a number I didn't recognize showed on the caller ID.  I answered it and got no response, curious ... and since I was sitting at work anyway I googled the number.  It came up as Lucifer Lighting.  I broke out in goosebumps.  What the fuck?!  \n\nI called it back and got the answering service saying their hours of operation.  I waited until they opened and called again.  I got a woman on the line and told her someone had called me from that number and I wanted to know why.  She asked me when I received the call and I told her, she said that the office was closed at that hour and there was no way anyone from their office called me since they don't do outbound calls anyway.\n\nI hung up and looked at my caller ID.  I looked at my call history.  I double checked the numbers.  Lucifers Lighting had called me less than 6 hours after I talked shit about it.\n\nEerie coincidence or something more?"},"373":{"title":"The Trail","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/zo30e\/the_trail\/","flair":null,"author":"reptar2012","selftext":"It was the summer of 2010 and me and my family were vacationing deep in Wisconsin. The nearest town was 23 miles away. No cell service. We were staying at some sort of resort. The cabin we were staying in had another very close to it. It was occupied by family friends we had know for awhile. They had two kids Mikey and Risa. Risa brought a friend with. all three of them were around 15ish and i was only going into sixth grade. My three brothers(oldest to youngest Connor, Scott, Jack, me\/Griffin) and i were close. We did everything with Mikey tagging along. But one night we all decided to sneak out of the cabins at 2 a.m. and go on a \"nature walk\". The resort had a large golf course. That's what we had decided would be our journey. The night came around and we met up at the fire pit. Me, being the youngest, was scared because my brothers told of how there were serial killers in the forest. We started walking. It was dark and all we had were crummy flashlights we had found in our cabin. I was in the back of the group when it happened. It was so fast though and i was so young there was nothing i could do. There was a loud crash from the woods surrounding us and a some clank as Mikey's flashlight hit the ground. My brothers laughed and started shouting Mikey's name. They thought it was a joke 20 minutes later it wasn't so funny. MIKEY!!!! we all started screaming. I was scared so i ran off thinking i was running towards the cabin i didn't stop till i was lost. I broke down. Curled up into a ball and cried. I finally stopped and i heard something rustle by the bushes. I ran towards it thinking it was Mikey. When i got to the tree line i looked into the miles of ongoing woods. I saw someone....no someTHING. Its red eyes pursed me. It was about at the level of the bushes when our eyes met. Then it stood up. It was massive. Bigger than any bear. It stood 11 feet tall about 20 yards away. It ran off as my brothers came running towards me screaming and yelling at what ever was it the woods. As it started off in the other direction it dropped something. A.......leg. Mikey's leg."},"374":{"title":"So. Just a question.

Half of my stuff came from there. Most of the products were good quality and cheap as chips. Best of all, there was free shipping. You could get almost anything there, from makeup brushes to electronic gadgets. I especially loved shopping for cute cat t-shirts and costume jewellery. I've always had a fabulous experience shopping there, until my most recent purchase.\n\nI looked down at the aged pair of earphones I owned. The plastic earbuds were loose and nearly falling off; I had to keep clicking them back into place every so often. Rubber was beginning to peel off the cable in thin strips, exposing the wires within. I figured I had another month of use before it would stop working completely. Just long enough for a replacement to arrive. \n\nJumping on Aliexpress, I managed to find a new pair of earphones for around 5 dollars. Like I said, super cheap. It looked pretty decent from the pictures. There weren't any reviews either but I wasn't too bothered. It was only a few dollars and if it turned out to be a dud, I could just skip my Subway lunch to make up for the loss.\n\nThe next morning, I headed down for breakfast. My father was already seated at the table, drinking his usual black coffee.\n\nI greeted him with a cheery, \"Good morning!\" and sat down with some toast and a glass of orange juice.\n\n\"There's a parcel for you on the hallway table. Arrived this morning,\" Dad murmured, not glancing up from his newspaper.\n\nI paused, midway through spreading Vegemite on my toast, and ran to retrieve the parcel. It had some Chinese characters on the label. I ripped the packaging off to find a pair of earphones.\n\n\"That's pretty quick for Aliexpress,\" I thought, elated yet somewhat perplexed. In my experience, shipping usually took ages, ranging from 3 weeks to a couple of months. Definitely not _overnight_. However, who was I to complain? I examined the earphones. The design was pretty state of the art, with blue coloured chrome covering the earpieces and a long, sturdy cable. On the underside of the volume control button, there were some letters engraved in fine print. It was something foreign; \"móguǐ\" was what it said.\n\n\"Probably the fake Chinese version of Bose,\" I laughed, plugging it into my phone to test the sound quality.\n\nIt was superb. The music was crisp and clear. I could hear the bass of my song, made prominent by the earphones. It was almost like being in a live concert. I thumped my head along with the beat, immersed in the glorious music. At the same time, I was congratulating myself on managing to find such a bargain!\n\nMy father tapped me on the shoulder, indicating that we would leave in 10 minutes. He usually gave me a ride to work on his way to the office so I quickly got ready to leave.\n\nWork was long and arduous. I finally got home and showered quickly, washing the grease and smoke that had impregnated my hair during my shift spent deep-frying chips. I plugged in the earphones and settled into bed to relax to some music.\n\nI had been listening for around half an hour when the song that was playing stopped abruptly. There was silence. I checked the pause button to see if I had accidentally tapped it but the screen still showed the song as playing. So I unplugged and plugged the earphones back into my phone, figuring that was where the problem lay. The song continued as before until _it_ happened again 15 minutes later.\n\nThis time, the song was interrupted by a strange, unintelligible chanting. It was in a language I could not understand and sounded somewhat _religious_, yet ominous. At the same time, a terrified feeling settled upon my being and I felt a sudden chill in the air, causing my skin to prickle. I tore the earphones off after a minute or so; the chanting had grown louder and louder, reaching an intense, unendurable, _crescendo_.\n\n\"What was that?\" I gasped, shaking. There was a light sheen of sweat all over my arms and legs. The earphones laid on my duvet cover, cables twisted menacingly.\n\nI cut them up and threw them away. There was obviously something wrong with the earphones, I don't know what, but it was _unnatural_. I went to sleep.\n\nI woke up, tired and groggy. All I could hear in my dreams was that goddamn _chanting_, a neverending soundtrack to the empty darkness that shrouded my mind in my sleep. I went about my usual routine. I was on my way to work when I began to hear the chanting again. This time, it didn't stop.\n\nAnd it hasn't for a month. As I write this, the interminable noise has gone on for 31 days or 744 hours or... or- I don't care. All I know is that every second it grows worse. The chanting gets louder and more _evil_. I'm trying to write this down quickly as I suspect I won't be able to do very much very soon. I just want the noise to stop but it won't, I've tried everything. \n\n_Oh please, please make it stop!_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote:\n\nThis is Cecilia's father. Unfortunately, Cecilia passed away three days ago. I found her in bed, dead. All I can say is please buy your earphones from a proper shop and not some shady site. Look what it's done to my daughter! I can't even have an open casket at the funeral. You see, she had cut off her ears and gouged out the internal parts as well. I just wish I had listened.\n\n\n"},"376":{"title":"I don't know what to do with my son Dylan...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/27vfqm\/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_son_dylan\/","flair":null,"author":"deuter72","selftext":"I need advice Reddit. I'm lying here in my bed with Wifey and we can't sleep. We're ... we just don't know what to do with our son Dylan anymore.\n\n5 years ago, Wifey and I moved to another part of the city to start life anew. Soon after moving into our new apartment, our lives soon returned to normalcy. Even better, Wifey's health recovered and then, we found out to our delight that she was pregnant. Few months later, our first child, a son whom we named Dylan, was born.\n\n\nSince a baby, Dylan had **refused** to be held by Wifey or myself. Every time we picked him up, he would struggle, cry and scratch our faces. But he would be perfectly happy being left alone. Worse, he would reject Wifey's milk if she tried breastfeeding him. She had to resort to pumping her milk into bottles for him to drink.  This has obviously taken a toll on Wifey and I. She's more fragile emotionally than me, and some nights, I would see her sitting next to Dylan's crib crying. It is difficult for a mother to stomach the fact that her only flesh and blood is rejecting her.\n\n\nThings didn't get better as Dylan grew older. His first word wasn't mama or papa, but **No!**. At 2 when he learned to string words together, he would say things like \"Not real mommy! Not real papa. Want real daddy and mommy\". He still wouldn't let us hold him. Because we don't drive, going out is a hassle if we had to hold him. Once, Wifey almost dropped him on his head as we struggled to get out of the cab. The past 2 + years, Wifey's emotional wellbeing was being tested so badly. Both of us have grown thinner and sadder. We love our son so much. We've never laid a finger on him. Why did he hate us so?\n\n\nBut the worst thing happened just yesterday. It was Dylan's first day at preschool. We specifically told the teachers Wifey would pick him up at 4pm. When she arrived, the teachers and her realised Dylan has disappeared.\n\n\nWe were frantic. Calls we made, police was alerted. Less than an hour later, police found him wandering a block from the preschool. It really drove us crazy.\n\n\nThat evening, Wifey and I sat him down.\n\n\"Why did you run away Dylan?\" Wifey and I were perplexed.\n\n\"I want go home!\"\n\n\"You're home.\" I said gently.\n\n\"NO! Real home! With my real mommy and daddy! You're NOT my mommy and daddy!\" \n\nThat really made Wifey cry.\n\nI was exasperated and frustrated, and I shouted, the first time ever, at my son \"WE ARE YOUR REAL MOMMY AND DADDY AND YOU'RE OUR DYLAN!\"\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nThen ... in his calmest voice ...\n\n\n\"No. My name is Christopher MacDonald. My mommy is Laura, and my daddy is Charles. I live in 57th Avenue. I have a brother Tommy.\"\n\n\n\"No...\" my wife stuttered. We were both stunned. Like the floor had just opened up and we were going to fall into it. \"Please don't say that...\"\n\n\"You kill me. You kill me!! You bang you car on me and KILL ME! Mommy cried and hold me but you and YOU just stare at me. You keep saying SORRY SORRY. NO!!! You stupid you!! I hate you!!\" Dylan started to tear.\n\n\nWifey let out a scream and ran towards the balcony. I knew what she was going to do. I knew she couldn't handle the revelation. We couldn't. I ran after her and snatched her before she climbed up the ledge and we both fell onto the floor, crying.\n\n\n\"I want to go home to my real mommy and daddy. Mommy, Daddy and Tommy miss me for so long. They must be very sad. I don't want them to be sad. Please bring me back.\"\n\n\nThat was the first time our son has ever said *please* to the both of us.\n\n\nIt's past 12 now. I'm lying in my bed, holding Wifey who has been crying non stop since.\n\n\n\"Should we return him to Laura and Charles?\" Wifey asked.\n\n\nI don't know. I really don't know.\n"},"377":{"title":"Pokemon: Black version","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/gbt0x\/pokemon_black_version\/","flair":null,"author":"ds98","selftext":"I’m what you could call a collector of bootleg Pokémon games. Pokémon Diamond & Jade, Chaos Black, etc. It’s amazing the frequency with which you can find them at pawnshops, Goodwill, flea markets, and such.\n\nThey’re generally fun; even if they are unplayable (which they often are), the mistranslations and poor quality make them unintentionally humorous.\n\nI’ve been able to find most of the ones that I’ve played online, but there’s one that I haven’t seen any mention of. I bought it at a flea market about five years ago.\n\n[Here](http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_l687r1Rn041qzpbds.jpg)’s a picture of the cartridge, in case anyone recognizes it. Unfortunately, when I moved two years ago, I lost the game, so I can’t provide you with screencaps. Sorry.\n\nThe game started with the familiar Nidorino and Gengar intro of Red and Blue version. However, the “press start” screen had been altered. Red was there, but the Pokémon did not cycle through. It also said “Black Version” under the Pokémon logo.\n\nUpon selecting “New Game”, the game started the Professor Oak speech, and it quickly became evident that the game was essentially Pokémon Red Version.\n\nAfter selecting your starter, if you looked at your Pokémon, you had in addition to Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle another Pokémon — “GHOST”.\n\nThe Pokémon was level 1. It had the sprite of the Ghosts that are encountered in Lavender Tower before obtaining the Sliph Scope. It had one attack — “Curse”. I know that there is a real move named curse, but the attack did not exist in Generation 1, so it appears it was hacked in.\n\nDefending Pokémon were unable to attack Ghost — it would only say they were too scared to move. When the move “Curse” was used in battle, the screen would cut to black. The cry of the defending Pokémon would be heard, but it was distorted, played at a much lower pitch than normal. The battle screen would then reappear, and the defending Pokémon would be gone. If used in a battle against a trainer, when the Pokéballs representing their Pokemon would appear in the corner, they would have one fewer Pokéball.\n\nThe implication was that the Pokémon died.\n\nWhat’s even stranger is that after defeating a trainer and seeing “Red received $200 for winning!”, the battle commands would appear again. If you selected “Run”, the battle would end as it normally does. You could also select Curse. If you did, upon returning to the overworld, the trainer’s sprite would be gone. After leaving and reentering the area, the spot [where] the trainer had been would be replaced with a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower.\n\nThe move “Curse” was not usable in all instances. It would fail against Ghost Pokémon. It would also fail if it was used against trainers that you would have to face again, such as your Rival or Giovanni. It was usable in your final battle against them, however.\n\nI figured this was the gimmick of the game, allowing you to use the previously uncapturable Ghosts. And because Curse made the game so easy, I essentially used it throughout the whole adventure.\n\nThe game changed quite a bit after defeating the Elite Four. After viewing the Hall of Fame, which consisted of Ghost and a couple of very under leveled Pokémon, the screen cut to black. A box appeared with the words “Many years later…” It then cut to Lavender Tower. An old man was standing, looking at tombstones. You then realized this man was your character.\n\nThe man moved at only half of your normal walking speed. You no longer had any Pokémon with you, not even Ghost, who up to this point had been impossible to remove from your party through depositing in the PC. The overworld was entirely empty — there were no people at all. There were still the tombstones of the trainers that you used Curse on, however.\n\n \n\nYou could go pretty much anywhere in the overworld at this point, though your movement was limited by the fact that you had no Pokémon to use HMs. And regardless of where you went, the music of Lavender Town continued on an infinite loop. After wandering for a while, I found that if you go through Diglett’s Cave, one of the cuttable bushes that normally blocks the path on the other side is no longer there, allowing you to advance and return to Pallet Town.\n\nUpon entering your house and going to the exact tile where you start the game, the screen would cut to black.\n\nThen a sprite of a Caterpie appeared. It was the replaced by a Weedle, and then a Pidgey. I soon realized, as the Pokémon progressed from Rattata to Blastoise, that these were all of the Pokémon that I had used Curse on.\n\nAfter the end of my Rival’s team, a Youngster appeared, and then a Bug Catcher. These were the trainers I had Cursed.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the Lavender Town music was playing, but it was slowly decreasing in pitch. By the time your Rival appeared on screen, it was little more than a demonic rumble.\n\nAnother cut to black. A few moments later, the battle screen suddenly appeared — your trainer sprite was now that of an old man, the same one as the one who teaches you how to catch Pokémon in Viridian City.\n\nGhost appeared on the other side, along with the words “GHOST wants to fight!”.\n\nYou couldn’t use items, and you had no Pokémon. If you tried to run, you couldn’t escape. The only option was “FIGHT”.\n\nUsing fight would immediately cause you to use Struggle, which didn’t affect Ghost but did chip off a bit of your own HP. When it was Ghost’s turn to attack, it would simply say “…” Eventually, when your HP reached a critical point, Ghost would finally use Curse.\n\nThe screen cut to black a final time.\n\nRegardless of the buttons you pressed, you were permanently stuck in this black screen. At this point, the only thing you could do was turn the Game Boy off. When you played again, “NEW GAME” was the only option — the game had erased the file.\n\nI played through this hacked game many, many times, and every time the game ended with this sequence. Several times I didn’t use Ghost at all, though he was impossible to remove from the party. In these cases, it did not show any Pokémon or trainers and simply cut to the climactic “battle with Ghost.\n\nI’m not sure what the motives were behind the creator of this hack. It wasn’t widely distributed, so it was presumably not for monetary gain. It was very well done for a bootleg.\n\nIt seems he was trying to convey a message; though it seems I am the sole receiver of this message. I’m not entirely sure what it was — the inevitability of death? The pointlessness of it? Perhaps he was simply trying to morbidly inject death and darkness into a children’s game. Regardless, this children’s game has made me think, and it has made me cry."},"378":{"title":"The Twitchy Kid working Drive Thru","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/4t9k2s\/the_twitchy_kid_working_drive_thru\/","flair":null,"author":"wholychao","selftext":"Ok. I think I can tell this in one go.\n\nThis happened a while a go. I've been trying to decide if I'd actually take the time to try and describe it to you. But I've got to get it out.\n\nIt was at the burger joint. I'm not sure I should say the name of the franchise. They've got nothing to do with it. Great food. Everyone should go there, it just happened to happen there.\n\nI was going out to lunch with my buddy Biron. Obviously, not his actual name. I was on lunch break from work and he didn't work. We go to this burger place all the time. A whole crew of us do, it's kinda was the only thing we all had in common. We were that midnight parking lot crew.\n\nBiron called us the Burger Knights. He called us that after the first time we did it. And we'd done it a lot once we got started. No, it's not what you think. I've got to ease into these things better. I mean, we got people fired.\n\nEver been to a burger place when they're training new staff? Don't. If you see some kid spilling oil or looking around like a lemming for leadership or you see the greasy smoke of a poorly managed grill you should run away. It will suck. I assure you. The kitchen crew are generally too busy keeping this whelpling from cutting his own thumbs off to do their own fucking work and the quality of the food goes straight down the toilet.\n\nTo Biron this was unacceptable.\n\nThis new guy was really screwing things up at our burger place. So, Biron got a few of us together, the core of the Burger Knights, and we went on the first war path. There were four of us. Me, Biron, Rusty and Boner.\n\nThe problem kid was working the drive through register. For those of you who don't know, in a kitchen crew there will usually be three or four people listening in to the chatter on the drive thru order box. The only one you talk to is whoever is working the register. But you can bet a manager babysitting the fries is listening and making fun of you viciously in hopes of impressing the girl working the grill, who is also listening.\n\nWe roll up and start giving an order to the kid. Then change the order after he repeats it. Only slightly changed, so it could be a mistake. Then keep changing the order and keep getting angrier, and louder. Trying not to laugh as we do. Finally Biron yells, \"If you can't understand English I'll just spend my money somewhere that can!\" And lays rubber down as we exit the drive thru.\n\nTwo days later we go back and the kid is gone. Biron asked the manager, just to be sure. But yeah, the kid got shitcanned. Biron was elated. That night he got a thirty rack of pebber opened his trunk in middle of the strip mall parking lot and the Knights celebrated for the first time.\n\nI was thinking about the rest of the times, but what matters is what happed... I almost said yesterday, but it's been almost a week. Damn it. I still haven't heard anything else or from anyone else. The place is still closed. It looks like they've cleaned up this inside, but. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nSo, screwing up drive thru orders worked for a while, but not forever. We had to get more creative. Boner created the Pink Shake Trick. That's where he'd demands a pink shake. This place has vanilla and chocolate shakes. Really, really thick ones. But Boner would demand a Pink Shake and once he felt sure the counter guy understood what he was demanding he would drive up to the window and wait. Just sit there and wait. And if anyone would ask he'd just keep demanding a Pink Shake.\n\nSix times out of seven, it would end with the counter guy insisting that such a thing didn't exist. Boner call the 800 number listed on all the receipts and tell them that the kid was refusing to provide for a simple request. Corporate never asks too many questions. Most Big companies are 'shoot first, ask questions never' from the top down. The kid was gone inside of a week. I mean, not as elegant as some of the tricks, but it did work.\n\nOh, and that seventh time. The kid actually made a god'amn pink shake. Boner was stupefied for a second. Sitting there looking at the pink milkshake in his hand. Then he threw the shake at the window and told the kid he wanted green. The shake exploded everywhere. I think some was even dripping down from inside the glass.\n\nIt even splashed back on Boner. He licked his hand as we drove away. He eyes tighten up a little and he says, \"I think that kid mixed BBQ sauce into the shake. It's actually pretty fuckin good!\"\n\nWe laughed about that one for the rest of the night.\n\nSo, about a week ago, when I'm out at lunch with Biron it goes bad from the moment we roll up on the order box. The kid is awkward and stilted when he talks over the speaker. Says he can't hear us half the time, and we're not even messing with the kid at this point. Either he just can't hear or hasn't figured out how to wear the headset. Then, when we get to the window, he's stumbling around looking for his co-workers, cuz he doesn't know what to do. You may not have picked up on this little detail, but Biron did. Kid was all alone on headset. If he's looking for his co-workers, that means they're off com and have left him in the weeds.\n\nThis kid was a goner. I almost felt bad. Mostly, because I could see in Biron's eyes that he had tasted blood. Biron says to me, \"Call the Knights. We're going on Warpath tonight.\"\n\nOh, had I mentioned he'd started calling it Warpath by that point. I mean, I don't think he knew anything like this might happen. He's just a dramatic guy. I reminded him that I was still on the clock, but he wanted to get started with whoever could make it right now. \"Just look at this kid,\" Biron spit, \"This can't wait.\" At the time, I actually agreed with him.\n\nOnce we finally got our food I put out a text to see who was around. There were a few responses by the time he dropped me off at my job. He told me to get over to the parking lot as soon as I could so I could join up with them. As he's driving off he shouts back at me, \"Bring a thirty rack!\"\n\nThe parking lot was less that a half mile from the burger place, so we kept all our cars there and would pack up into one car at a time to fuck with the kid. When I got to the parking lot there were six cars there and two people sitting around listening to music. It was just after dark and Biron had been fucking with this kid all day.\n\nI sat and shot the shit with the two guys there, low level kids who had just made it to a few gatherings but hadn't been on Warpath yet. They were excited. What can I say, there's not much to do in a bigish little city in the middle of fucking nowhere.\n\nSoon enough, the car comes rolling back through. Boner is driving and Biron is whooping like a madman in the backseat.\n\nHe jumps out of the car and sees me. He trows up his hands and runs at me shouting, \"Eight!\", then he grabs my shoulders and continues, \"Six out of eight!\" and laughs. I start laughing too. This kid has actually made a pink shake! This is going to be an epic night. At least, that's what I thought at the time.\n\nWe all piled into Biron's car to make another run at the burger place. I'm in the backseat, center. And Biron is shouting back at me as he navigates the three tight corners between the parking lot and the burger joint. Apparently, this kid looks like he's just about to have a psychotic break. And we're about to watch Biron to his Triple Burger bit.\n\nIt's a lot like the original bit, but Biron orders three burgers then specifies a super complicated toppings request and tells the counter kid that all three burgers should be the same. The kid confirms the order, then Biron starts another different topping request. The kid is confused, which makes sense. Biron explains that it's a simple order of three burgers and gives an entirely new topping request.\n\nThe guys are having a really hard time holding it in at this point, but we know if we laugh this kid might realize what's going on, so everyone holds it in while Biron tells the poor kid he just wants one burger with triple patties. There is long drawn out moan of agonizing death ended with a brief attack of hyperventilation. Biron just shouts \"Triple Burger, make it happen.\" And pulls up to the window.\n\nRusty is in the front seat and he starts laughing. \"Dude, look! They haven't cleaned up the Pink Shake.\" He shuts up quick, but we can all see the pink stain dripping down the glass. He's right. It's hilarious. We're all wondering what this kid is going to give Biron, but we all know what ever it is it's going to be wrong. Kid hands him the bag saying, \"Here you go, three triple burgers. That'll be $16.66\"\n\nBiron starts trowing burgers back at the kid and yelling. \"I only asked for one burger, asshole!\" Poor kid is trying to dodge sloppy incoming burgers that are fragmenting on him while Biron keeps yelling, \"I'm not paying for these, and I'm not paying for this one!\" opening the last burger and taking a massive bite out of it before speeding away.\n\nI think the kid was actually twitching before I lost sight of him through the back windows. The last thing I noticed was a tomato slice that had been stuck to his face falling to the floor. Fucking kid.\n\nWe turned the one way onto the parkway and veered off back towards the parking lot we were all whooping it up. These was the best night I'd ever seen and it was only the first run I'd been on. I didn't know, I would have stopped.\n\nRusty had come up with a new trick and we were going to run it next. It was Rusty's bit, so we all piled into Rusty's car. Everyone wanted to know what it was, but outside of clearing it with Biron, he just said he wanted it to be a surprise. Biron wasn't going to say anything either, but he was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nWe got to the burger joint and Rusty pulls into a parking spot behind the order box. If your having trouble picturing it, it's like a big u-loop, with a few parking spots in the middle of the 'u' - to not waste space, I guess. Rusty shuts off the engine, and we all want to know what's going on. But he just waits, listening to the radio till the song is done. Then he tells us something I'd known but hadn't thought much about. \"You know those order boxes are always listening, even if there's no one there.\" I'm still confused, all of us in the back seat at least. Biron is just grinning in the front.\n\nRusty jumps out of the car and walks up to the side of the menu board, just outside of the security camera. Don't ask how we knew where the cameras are pointed. He's just standing there. Then Biron rolls down his window and we can hear Rusty talking. Just barely.\n\n\"They all want you to go,\" He's saying, \"Think about it. They've got it out for you. They want you gone. Where are they. Are they watching you. Is somebody watching you. Why are you even here. You should do it. Just do it. Why don't you. You know they're out to get you. It's only a matter of time. They deserve it. Do it. It's the only way.\"\n\nAnd he's just going on and on. Fucking amazing. I don't know where this kid comes up with this shit, but it's amazing. They guys are all on the edge of conniption fits trying to hold down the laughter. This is the most epic night of Warpath ever. I mean, there's no way this kid can take it. Fuck.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, Rusty gets back in the car and we drive back to the parking lot and crack open the thirty rack. Then... I guess we forgot about the kid. We started telling war stories about the best runs we'd done before. And hour turned into two or three, and the next thing you know it's really, really late.\n\nBiron decides he wants to roll past the drive thru one last time. They're closed, but not by a lot. There's a good chance we'll get a chance to see the kid mopping up the kitchen, and for some reason Biron really liked watching that. I guess it made him feel superior, or victorious. I could never really work out what kinds of feelings Biron was having. But I didn't care, I wanted to go too.\n\nA few people went home, so there were only three of us on that last drive by. We rolled up slow on the order box. Suddenly we all lurched forward. Biron had slammed on the breaks. We all knew why, we all heard it. The second we were at the order box it started talking. He started talking. \"Please drive thru. Nobody can help you now. They're all gone.\" Nobody said anything, but the kid just kept repeating \"Please drive thru. They're all gone.\" over and over. Even as we pulled up he kept repeating over and over again.\n\nThe window was closed. The kid was sitting there staring out the window. Not at us, I don't think he was actually looking at anything. He would twitch occasionally. We couldn't hear the order box speaker and like I said, the window was closed. But his lips were moving and I think he was just repeating the same things. The somebody shouted \"Drive!\"\n\nThe car didn't go anywhere. And the scene in the kitchen was starting to come into focus. It looked like there was fry smoke thick in the air. The night manager was bent over into the fryolator. The oil boiling over where his face went in. The voice shouted again, \"Drive!\" I think it might have been my voice.\n\nOn the floor by the front counter I could just barely see the body of the grill girl. I could only tell by her hair. Her face was mostly gone. Her fingers were gone and blood pooled around her hands. She was dead. I mean, I don't know, but I wish for her that she was dead.\n\nThen the window opened and the kid turned his blood spattered face towards us and said \"Drive.\" Biron screamed and the car lurched forward.\n\nWe didn't say anything on the way back to the parking lot. There was nothing to say. We all got into our cars and drove away. I didn't sleep at all that night. I thought about writing it down for you. I tried, but I just couldn't.\n\nThe next day I drove past the burger joint on my way into work. There were cop cars in the parking lot and the doors were block off with police tape. There was nothing in the newspapers. There are a lot of people wondering what happened. Three of us know for sure. But none of us have said anything. I haven't heard from Biron since that night. I haven't been back to the parking lot since. I really have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to sleep since that night. Maybe I can sleep now. I'm going to try.\n"},"379":{"title":"I love my sister!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8o7bzx\/i_love_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"saltshaker78","selftext":"My name is jimmy, I live with my sister after my mom and dad got a divorce. Since I'm with my sister, she said that she always need to go to work, so she put me incharge of the house whenever  she works. I'm always alone that's why my sister always reminded me to lock the doors and if a bad guy shows up I need to dial the police number 9-1-1. I cook, I clean and play whenever I'm bored, but never tell my sister that sometimes I'm stealing a dollar on her wallet for my \"salary\".\n\n\nOne night my sister came home late, and she smells like beer, so I assisted her to her room upstairs she even vomitted on the stairs so I need to clean it up later. When she's on her room, she immediately fell over the bed she also started crying. She told me that she got fired from work so I immediately grabbed the first aid kit and told her to show the burns. She laughed, I don't know why but I think she's back to normal, she said that the clinic on her work already healed the damage with magic! I told her to let me see the doctor sometime and she agreed.\nAfter she calmed down, she then told me to go to my room and sleep, I also got a free kiss\n\n\nI woke up the next morning and I checked on her, she said that she had an entire month of day of so we could play! But she's still asleep. I went down the kitchen and prepared bacon and eggs with toast. I went to her room and woke her up saying that her breakfast is ready, she's not in the mood so I just said that I will feed her, she just smiled and after that I fed her she said that I'm a good cook as always and will be a chef someday! The rest of the day continued with me cleaning up the dishes and cleaning the house but sis said that she's the one that will clean the bathroom and take the trash out so I leave it be for now, after that I played with her and she sent me to bed\n\n\nIt's been one week, and it's really fun with sister around we played that noon but a police came to our house he said that the house smells really bad, like a rat house, I said that maybe it's because of the garbage so he just ignored it. Then he said if he can go upstairs since his a police I trusted him and I went upstairs with him. He checked my room and sister \n\n\nBeer bottles rattle as soon as the door opens...the smell of rotten food engulfed the air...the police came to my sister and looked at it...he said that my sister is dead...I thought that the police is nice but I think his just a criminal in suit... ssssoo I grabbed my sister's hand and run but...her hand is the only thing that followed me...\n\n\nHey doc?

I didn't notice I had something like this until I rented out my very own apartment. The apartment was cockroach infested and had bugs crawling everywhere. Cockroaches were all over the bed, all over my tooth brush, & all over my clothes. I never really liked any of the bugs but because the rent was dirt cheap, I couldn't really complain. \n\nI noticed my fetish when I was lying down in bed. I just got out of the shower so I was naked. All of the sudden, A cockroach crawled onto my testicles. At first I screamed in fear but then the roach started to crawl up my shaft. That's when the sensation appeared, I didn't really complain so I grabbed the roach and started to rub it against the tip. The roach felt great as it slid from the bottom of the shaft to the tip of my penis. I started to gather around bugs from my house and contain them in a small jar. After I gathered many cockroaches in a jar, I lied down on my bed again and took the jar in my hands. I then took off the lid and put the jar upside down above my member. The cockroaches then infested my penis. There were more than 4 cockroaches all over my testicles. They weren't small but they were medium size cockroaches.\n\nAfter I started taking more notice of my fetish, I realized I wanted more than just small cockroaches. I talked to an old friend I knew about something like this. We called him one eyed Fred, I don't know why though; both of his eyes were still intact. One eyed Fred was the type of person you went to if you needed help with just about anything. He was there to supply your drug needs and your exotic import needs as well. When I told him about my fetish, Fred took it very lightly. He said that he didn't find anything wrong with my fetish and that he seen many other fetish cases like mine. He was happy to help. When he told me about the cockroaches he could provide, I got really happy. He said he could provide Madagascar cockroaches for my fetish needs. At first I found it to be bullshit, I mean those things are huge; I didn't really believe he could provide them to me.\n\nThe next day I paid a visit to one eye Fred and found him holding a large box in his arms. The thing was so huge and it looked like it was really heavy for Fred. I walked up to him and asked if that's the cockroaches and Fred responded, \"No that's the box, the cockroaches are inside.\" Fred wasn't really bright but he did have contacts and that's why I needed him. I paid him what I had on me for the box. He charged me a fortune, over $200 for these little sexy critters.\n\nI brought them home and I prepared myself for the cockroaches. If you don't know what they look like, here's a picture [Madagascar cockroaches](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BXu0Oun.jpg)\n\nI lied down on my bed and covered my member with lube. I wanted to make sure I was going to have the healthiest session because I heard that lube increases pleasure. I realized these cockroaches probably weren't clean so I took hand sanitizer and began rubbing it on my shlong. I didn't know much about these cockroaches so I was prepared for the best experience ever. I held the jar above my shlong and I flipped it upside down. Instead of the cockroaches falling out, they crawled out from the side of the jar. They then crawled onto my hands and then crawled down my arms. They made their journey up my chest and a one started to crawl into my mouth. The other started to crawl into my eyes. I grabbed the one on my eyes and set him on my dick but he didn't take kindly to that and started digging his way down my shlong. It hurt like hell, I was screaming pretty hard but I realized while I was screaming, one of the cockroaches was laying behind my cheekbone trying to make its way down my throat. I felt like I was being gagged and I loved it. \n\nWhen the other cockroach was digging down on my dick, it started to make its way down my hole. It started to dig a bigger hole and then began to crawl down. I was screaming but I didn't stop it. Someplace deep in my heart, there was a voice telling me this is where I belonged. This was the life I so desperately wanted to live and now there was no more judgment but only trial and error as I committed to the idea of being fucked by cockroaches. It was done, the cockroach was already half way inside my shlong and I didn't know if it was alive. I could just see an antenna sticking out from the tip. My penis looked very deformed at this point. It didn't have a straight shape anymore.\n\nHappiness, just happiness.\n"},"381":{"title":"Goodbye Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ry5l3\/goodbye_friend\/","flair":null,"author":"Sithlord0100","selftext":"As a college student, I work side jobs. One of the side jobs i worked was for a friend of mine, babysitting his two kids. I will never baby sit again. The kids were good, but my friend died while i was watching them. This was sad and all but it's what happened the next day that freaked me out. I have slept with a light on ever since.\nThe day after my friend died, my parents left for a camping trip. This left me and my dog home alone to figure out how to cope with everything. This meant throwing the biggest party i could. The party went well that night, everyone had fun and once things were over people started leaving. As usual i was stuck with clean up duty, as somehow everyone had work the next day. After cleaning up the mess and throwing all the beer bottles and handles away, i locked up the house and got ready to go to bed. I double checked the doors, and even dead bolted and chained the front door. Crawling into bed, i always sleep with my dog next to me. Tonight he seemed a little jumpy and agitated. I figured this was due to the party and the amount of people who were around. I ignored him and slowly approached sleep. As i was about to fall asleep the dog freaks out and i hear the distinct sounds of light switches flicking on and both the front door flying open as well as the back door. As it is when my parents are gone, i sleep with a shotgun next to my bed. Thinking that I was about to be robbed I prepared for the worse. I searched the house room to room, shotgun in hand, ready for anything. The only thing i found strange or out of place was how cold the house had become. Otherwise nothing else was weird. The doors had opened by themselves and all, and i mean all, the lights in the house were on. I knew i had locked up and there was no way someone had gotten in because the screen doors and garage door were still locked. I think my friend who i had lost the day before may have been playing a trick on me for not inviting him to the party. This experience has freaked me out and made me a believer in the supernatural ever since. He still visits me in different ways and forms but nothing as extreme as that night."},"382":{"title":"The Video.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3cwavp\/the_video\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"I use YouTube pretty much whenever I get the chance. I am pretty much a fanatic. Although I will say that Dailymotion is better, it's an animalistic reflex to go to YouTube. I had been bored with my subscriptions lately and I had wanted something different. I was thinking along the lines of someone going into a haunted house and getting spooked. I was getting sleepy though and I felt it was best to wait until later to view that stuff or I'd be seeing it in my dreams. It's not uncommon for something like that to happen. Before sleeping, I made and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and played some Minecraft for a half hour. I felt ready to sleep then.\n\nWhen I woke up, my stomach was in a bit of pain from going to sleep right after eating. I should've waited another 15 minutes, used the extra minutes to finish up my carrot farm in Minecraft. I felt it was not necessary though, But I took a tums and went about my day. I got on my computer and talked to my girlfriend on Skype, I asked her how she was doing and she said that she was doing fine and that she was watching this new YouTuber. I asked her about YouTuber, you know, what are his videos, what is he like. When I asked she just giggled like I was kidding around. I asked again and she said; \"He's a little intense for your tastes.\"\n\nGod damn it, she shouldn't have said that. She sent my curiousity into overdrive. She had later emailed me the YouTuber's account. I didn't want to get to it right away so I watched some other videos. But something was odd, I checked my subscriptions and I found a video. \"If you encounter this, throw your computer into a dumpster.\" I didn't understand what that could've meant. The video explained about how there is a new YouTube channel that is very very disturbing, as there are instances of blood, gore, the usual. But it's not faked, it is very grotesque and realistic. Plus, you cannot exit the browser until you watch 3 videos from the channel. I was interested for a second but I didn't really want to see. I had went about my day, watching some Rob Dyke, I Hate Everything, and SomeOrdinaryGamers.\n\nI was about to shut my computer down for the rest of the day and take a nap but I still hadn't seen that channel my girlfriend sent to me. I went ahead and checked it and there it was, the link and a playlist of every video the channel has to offer. I went to the channel and... Oh shit, this was the  YouTube channel I watched about, I tried exiting my browser but as you'd expect, I couldn't close it. It's like it locked the close button. The browser full screened. I was screwed, no shit about that. I was trapped for a while. I clicked on one video. \"carrie\"\n\nI won't unsee what I've seen. It was a 22 minute video. The first minute was a message saying;\n\n\"You cannot exit the browser, and leaving your computer for more than 12 seconds is a death wish. You will die if you try to not watch this video. You must watch it, or else. This is joy my friend, true joy. You will experience the reason people were made today.\"\n\nI will explain this video in as much detail as I can, so if you have an uneasy stomach, go away.\n\nThe video begins with the cameraman putting the camera on a tripod, and a girl is seen on a chair, strapped down. \"Tell us what your name is little girl\" The cameraman says. \"Come on, don't be shy.\" The girl begins to cry, and I seemingly wonder why. It didn't take me too long to figure out why though. The blank, white room with plastic on the floor, the girl tied up to a chair. You figure the rest, she was getting murdered. \"TALK TO ME!\" The cameraman says in an almost demonic way. The girl begins talking. \"Ca--Carr--Carrie\" The girl is beginning to sweat, cry, and starts struggling. I can't stand to watch, but I know if I stop watching, I may end up like this girl.\n\nThe cameraman goes right up to the camera, and says \"This is what I feel the joy of creation is.\" He takes his balisong and spins it in the girls face. The cameraman \"accidently\" throws his balisong into the girls left eyeball. Blood pouring out, the girl screaming bloody murder, screaming I have never heard before or have ever wanted to hear. The cameraman takes the knife out of the eyeball, forcing it out of it's socket, and I see the optical vein connected to the skull about to be cut out. The cameraman cuts the vein, making the eyeball fall to the floor, then the cameraman goes to the girl and begins cutting into her breasts, taking the shirt and bra off to get a better look, cutting a \"C\" into the right breast. Then proceeding to stab in alot of other areas. The video didn't end until the girl had no more life in sight. I was glad when the video was over, but I was horrified.\n\nI then get a popup on my computer. \"Only 2 more to go.\"\n\nI WANT THIS TO FUCKING END! SOMEONE, GET ME OUT! Ok ok... I can POSSIBLY make it through this. I saw a 3 minute video and thought that might be a quickpass. It was a tutorial on how to cook a victim. There are actually 152 ways. How the fuck is this even possible? How is YouTube not even checking up on this? No local authorities involved? How the fuck?! Anyway, I only had one more video to watch. It was an hour long video, a documentary. I decided to start it, the documentary was on what to do if a victim possesses any of your belongings in an act of vengeance.\n\nI only got through the video half-way through before I fell asleep. This guy Freddy-Kruger'd my ass! He grabbed me while I was asleep and was about to start murdering me when I grabbed his hand and began twisting it. He deserves it for being such a sadistic fuck. He started laughing at me. \"Kid, this is life! People die and get hurt. I might as well give both at once.\" He's still giggling away like a school-girl. \"Go to hell.\" I tell him, and he then slams my head into the keyboard.\n\nI start running whenever I get my vision back and I run into my 8 year old brothers room. Bad bad mistake, he then goes into there and sees the kid. He grabs my brother and points a revolver to his head.\n\n\"It's either you or him.\" The sadistic fuck told me. I... I...\n\n\"Kill me first so I don't have to watch him die.\" I'd rather the both of us dead and appease this shithead, but I want to die first. \"Nah, I'll just kill him and leave you in horrible mental pain for the rest of your life.\"\n\nHe shoots my brother, and he figuratively shoots me in the stomach. He walks off like nothing ever happened with a grin on his face.\n\nFuck YouTube."},"383":{"title":"Aliens invaded my school and are now killing everyone in some sick games.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2x31q2\/aliens_invaded_my_school_and_are_now_killing\/","flair":"Series","author":"Negieren","selftext":"Have you thought that you knew enough about the world?

She held the gun and before she got to shoot, her hands dissolved before my very eyes, the solid bones of hers soon turned into nothing but slimes, I could see the flesh and skin of hers merging slowly burning and steaming, it was all to graphic, so she just was on the floor, crying and limbless.\n\n\"No touching other people's weapon <3!\" It changed its face into a smiley.\n\nThen the face of that thing changed.\"**ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS IS THE WOLF, FUCKING KILL THE WOLF BEFORE YOU GET KILLED YOURSELF, THAT'S THE GAME MOTHERFUCKER!**\" \n\nIt's face suddenly turned red and it frowned it shouted so loud, it turned Samatha deaf again, breaking her hearing aids..\n\nSamantha screamed very loudly, Alicia went there quickly over there and gave Samantha a hug, only to dissolve into a puddle. \n\n*what was happening.*\n\nA minute ago Samantha was my dream girl, now she is something I want to avoid, she quickly adverted her self from death but it was too late, she tightly hugged Samantha, but Samantha was wearing a flak jacket, the rule was to not touch other people's weapon, her entire body touched it, slowly she dissolved, I could see blood dripping about, that pulled her skin, flesh, blood everything of hers it all looked like a messy mess, like marshmallows when heated for too long.\n\nShe kept muttering, but it was useless with her mouth like that..probably around 2 feet tall..gross...Samantha looked at her with terrified eyes and cried running to me and in the process stepped on Alicia's skull, crushing everything that's left of her, she was shaking.\n\n\"Zts..sts..ze,.tsa..\" I no longer liked her, she looked like a fucking retard..\n\n-x-x-\n\nThe little alien went through the door and exited, the door closed automatically.\n\nThe first thing we did was to open the door, it wouldn't budge.\n\nIn just a few moment, we looked at each other, there are 18 students left, no sooner it turned into hell, everyone was killing each other, pencils were used to draw lines everywhere, anyone who dared to touch it got there legs dissolved.\n\nThrowing rubber bands at each other..what I heard was more unpleant.\n\n\"SORRY, SORRY I AM SO SORRY, UGHHHWAA STOP SHOOTING YOU MOTHR-\"\nNever have I heard Sesi, talk such a way, she has a kind heart.\n\n\"HAHAHA THIS IS LIKE ROBLOX, IM GOING TO KILL YOU NOOBS TAKE THIS, TAKE THAT..\"\n\nThat sounded like the no lifer, Jull.\n\n\"Nyaaaaaa! Stop it, it hurts, it hurts, *It hurts,* **IT FUCKING HURTS!**\"\nIt's Ioep , the candy eye of the class.\n\n\"Don't kill me no.., I'm your friend, stop look..do you want money..hey stop..\"\n\nThe cranky voice was similar, \nI looked up to see Max, he was right next to ****1, our top student, he shoved his pistol next to his face and pulled the trigger, now Max looked like some horrible monster you see in your dreams, jaws wide open..I don't know..but, I've seen stuff way worse on the Internet, so that means I'm Pretty safe, right?\n\nPaper airplanes were the fatalist, once touch and you completely dissolve, people even used straws and spat at other, dissolving their face, it was horrible, people stabbing each other, losing there limbs, it was chaos no one could've stopped them, I luckily hid behind the desk with Samantha, my weapon was a sword, so I had some confidence, then we heard footsteps towards us, a guy bent down and looked at us, it terrified us, then we realised he was headless.\n\nIt roll over to Samantha, but she didn't react, she closed her eyes, she had to be the quietest person around here, I've seen many bad stuff from the Internet, but nothing can beat the horror of this game, my heart was beating, nor did I remember a moment without sweating,\n\nIn the end it seemed only one survived, it was \"****1\"\n\nThere's something about that guy that I just can't touch..he asked us both to come, I held Samantha's eyes, I didn't want her to see..well just imagine dismembered bodies everywhere around your classroom..heads and bodies of classmates you know, the only one survived was ****1 and the girl from earlier, you know the nerdy one with pony tails, I thought she looked hilariously stereotypical, apparently, she survived by pretending to be dead.\n\nSo ***1 finally spoke, \"one of us here is the \"Wolf\" the thing was talking about.\"\n\nThen I asked him, \"How do we know?\"\n\nHe them held the gun Robert wore, it surprised me when his hand didn't dissolve, he pointed at the girl and so then, she started to crawl her way out of it, it was pointless, I couldn't save her the floor was full of lines and weapons, I'm afraid of losing a limb.\n\nWithout hesitation ; he killed her.\n\n\"Turns out she isn't the one.\"\n\nI didn't speak a single word, I didn't knew her long enough to care, but the way he treats her gives me a picture of what might happen to me.\n\nHe then looked at me, Iz was thinking of moving away, just then he threw heaps of marbles around me, I quickly climbed over the desk and pulled Samantha.\n\nHe took out his gloves then took out a coin from his sleeves.\n\nHe called me \"Heads.\" And he called Samantha \"Tails.\" \nIs he mad? Is he crazy? What's he thinking..I don't want to die..\n\nHe flipped it, while he flipped it, I quickly threw a sword at him, it missed him and instead knocked over his coin, it lands on **Tails.**\n\nBefore I could go ahead and save Samantha, he shot her in the head with perfect accuracy, he withdrawn his gun faster than I could think.\n\nEverything disappeared.\n\nNo really, everything disappeared, no signs of corpse, no signs of blood or weapons, it was just me and ***1..\n\n\"Congratulations you completed level 1! Please proceed to the next room.\"\n\nThe door was opened, ****1 and I went through the door, just as we entered.\n\nI could swear I was inside a spaceship, all I saw was a place full of staircases, corridors etc..\n\n-x-x-\n\n\n**11-A = 3, 11-B= 4, 11-C= 2 11-D= 1.**\n\nAs of now, I'm writing this through a laptop they gave, I think I may be in a spaceship, I'm not in for anal probing, I tried to communicate with my mother, but they seem to have no recollection of me and she blocked me, same goes with anyone else.\n\nBefore the next game starts, I guess I should tell you about how the others felt, I myself am somewhat of a stoic, although it striked fear in me, I didn't really care for most of them, I didn't really care much..but ****1 was probably the real stoic, he never has shown any facial expression.\n\nJust behind us ****twin 1 and twin 2 came, they were always despised, can't blame the others though, I too myself bear hatred for them, they didn't seem to show any reaction.\n\nFrom 11-A= Came three people, ****Nerd, he is a neurotic person and so very..self centred, he seems to be shaking.\n\n****2, I met her this morning, she and I have not really talked much, but I could swear she was staring at me at the train, she is always trembling, she is covered in blood..so..\n\n****|, ****| is a tomboy, despite being a girl she's always so pushy, but she is stronger than most people I know so..she seems to be visibly sad though.\n\nFrom 11-C= Came, ****£ A rich boy, I don't know much about him other than the fact he's loaded, he is unconscious.\n\n****||, ****|'s boyfriend..he's a real fucked up kid and a bully, he's a shorty but he's good at basketball, he's caring £, he seems to be very solemn.\n\nAnd the last and also the most memorable one..****Awesome, I think he's the strongest guy in this school..he killed police officers once when he was in grade school, he would often fight against a pack alone, he is notable for his strength and his urge to kill..\n\nHe was pretty much naked except for his boxers, he was smiling, he wasn't faking it, he was laughing as well, his face was shrouded in mystery, how could someone just laugh at this situation?\n\n\"Hey ||, we gotta get out of here..where are we?\"\n\n\"I don't know Hun..but everything's going to be alright, Kay?\"\n\n\"You don't know that..we're going to fucking die..leave that loser..\"\n\nJust then | grabbed one of the androids passing by, the androids looked exactly like the entity that greeted us earlier.\n\nShe pulled it and exclaimed, \"Where's the fucking bathroom?\"\n\nIt replied,\"Ma'm the next game is about to start, after that you may rest, it is not advisable to leave the game, however, if you do wish so then it's  that way.\"\n\nThe android pointed to northeast of where we were, we were at the centre of whatever we are in, it looks surprisingly like our school, we were at the first floor, in the corridor, the android told them to go straight ahead as theres a door that leads them to the toilet.\n\nSo they went, leaving £ on the floor, of course someone did carry him, it was 2 and Nerd, the android told us to go to the music room to start our next game.\n\nAwesome didn't like to talk, 1 is always silent, and twin1 and 2 are muttering to each other.\n\nIt was only me at those Class-A nerds, so I went along with them.\n\n\"2 and * you two should listen to me, we shall form a group and eventually find a way out of this game.\"\n\n2:\"I guess that works just fine..the first game was pretty dirty..\"\n\nMe:\"What did you do for the first game?\"\n\nNerd:\"We did the same thing..using weapons to kill the wolf.\"\nHe averted his face when he mentioned it.\n\nMe: \"Do you know the situation we're stuck in?\"\nHe looked back at me, he likes to be a know it all.\n\nNerd:\"Actually, we are not the only school in the world to be victimised..actually numerous schools have been selected,\"\n\n\"Even those who missed school and quitted, but I heard they have to do a different \"game\", it's sick how everyone who had to go to school has to do it..even those starting in kindergarten.\"\n\nMe:\"How did you k-..?\"  \"I asked an android.\"\n\nHe interrupted me, like I said before he likes to be a know it all.\n\nWe made it to the second floor in no time, Awesome kicked the door with excitement to only see chairs, \n\n**\"\"Musical chair?\"**\n\n-x-x-\n\nThere we could see ten chairs, forming a circle.\n\n*Come, sit down, it'll be a very pleasuring moment!*\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"384":{"title":"iMessage","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2p3lcr\/imessage\/","flair":null,"author":"IAmPoro","selftext":"The other night I was IMessaging with my best bro. It was a normal conversation, or so I had thought. I found out a few day later the conversation was not at all what I had thought it had been. The conversation went like this\n\nMe 7:59 P.M: Hey dude what’s up? Jason 8:01 P.M: Not much bro just watching TV. Me 8:0 P.M1: Same dude. You wanna come over? Jason 8:02 P.M: Can’t. Home alone. You know the rules. I can’t have anyone over nor can I go anywhere.\n\nJason’s parents were very strict and had odd rules. If they wern’t home he couldn’t have anyone over which I could understand. But, I never understood why he couldn’t go to other people’s houses. Wouldn’t that be better than him being home alone. Jason and I were both Seventeen. I had my license as did all of our friends. Jason didn’t. It’s not that he didn’t pass the test… he didn’t even take it. He didn’t even take driver’s ed. His parents thought people in High School were too young and irresponsible to drive cars. Jason had a strict curfew of 8:00 on weekdays with a bedtime at 10. His curfew on weeknights was 9:30 even though he could stay up until whenever he wanted. His parents didn’t allow him to eat any junk food. No pizza. No burgers. They mostly ate healthy stews and casseroles. I’ve eaten over at his house a few times. It’s not that the food is bad it’s just overly healthy, which I didn’t think was possible.\n\nMe 8:02 P.M: Yeah I know. Stupid Rule. Jason 8:03 P.M: Tell me about it. I can’t wait for college so I can get out of this prison. Me 8:03 P.M: I Bet. We need to do something soon. We’ve barely hang out all summer. Jason 8:05 P.M: Yeah it’s cuz you’ve been with Jenna for most of it. Me 8:06 P.M: yeah…. I know and I’m sorry….\n\nJenna was my girlfriend. We had been dating for three months and it was just starting to becoming serious. Admittedly, I had been spending way too much time with her and started hanging out with my friends less and less. But, Jenna lived two houses down and Jason lived a block away. And with Jason’s parents so strict it was easier just to see Jenna. Jenna wasn’t a demanding girlfriend and encouraged me to hang out with my friends more but, as time went on I started to fall more and more in love with her and I wanted to spend more more time with her.\n\nJason 8:07 P.M: No your not. It’s okay though bro. I know what its like to have a girlfriend. You and Jenna are a good couple. I get it.\n\nMe 8:08 P.M: Yeah but that whole Bros before Hoes thing. I feel like I’m breaking the bro code.\n\nJason 8:09 P.M : The last time anyone followed the Bro code was in seventh grade. That thing was stupid anyway. It was written by some low life douchebag. Me 8:10: Haha. true. But still I feel bad.\n\nJaso 8:11 P.M: Bro… don’t. If It was me with the girl I would choose her over you. Sex vs. video games. Sex obviously wins.\n\nMe 8:11 P.M : We don’t have that much sex.\n\nJason 8:12 P.M: sureee…. dude I see the look on your face in your snaps. You always look like you just got some.\n\nMe 8:12 P.M: If you say so.\n\nJason 8:14 P.M: shit I heard a noise.\n\nMe 8:14 P.M: What kind of noise? It’s probably nothing dude.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: It was a loud bang noise from downstairs. I’m gonna go check it out. If you don’t hear from me…. I’m probably dead.\n\nMe 8:16 P.M : dude that’s not funny.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: I wasn’t trying to be.\n\nJason: 8:20 P.M: I think someone’s in my house.\n\nMe 8:20 P.M: very funny.\n\nJason 8:21 P.M: No I’m serious… I hear them walking around downstairs…..\n\nMe 8:21 P.M: dude stop fucking around. It’s not funny.\n\nJason 8:22 P.M: No… Nik…. I’m serious….. I think someone’s in my house…… I’m going to go see.\n\nMe 8:23 P.M : Jason if someone was really in your house I wouldn’t go down stairs I would lock myself in my room.\n\nMe 8:24 P.M: If you’re going down to check it means you really don’t think someone is there and you’re just checking to make sure. Its probably nothing dude….\n\nMe 8:27 P.M: So did you check?\n\nMe: 8:29 P.M: Funny. You probably just went to take a shower and made shit up to get a laugh.\n\nMe 8:54 P.M: Okay…. Now you’re scaring me dude…. either that or you’re jacking off in the shower….\n\nMe 8:59 P.M: Jason….. I’m about to call the police….. stop scaring me….\n\nI was half scared half going along with the joke. I knew Jason really well and he was one to pull a prank. But, something about this felt off. But I just shook it off. I was also somewhat busy making last minute plans to go over to Jenna’s. I finally got a reply from Jason.\n\nJason 9:05 P.M: Duuuuuudddddeee I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I really did hear a noise. But, It was the dog…. Scared me to death…. Then I got hungry and made a pizza and totaly forget about you… sorry…\n\nMe 9:06 P.M: It’s okay. Glad it was nothing.\n\nJason 9:07 P.M: Yeah but it kinda freaked me out…. You should come over and chill me. My parent’s are gonna be home til super late. You can spend the night. I know I sound like a pussy but…..\n\nMe 9:08 P.M: But What about you parent’s rule. No one can come over?\n\nJason 9:10 P.M: Fuck the rule. I’ll just tell them I was bored and kinda spooked and needed you to come over. They’ll get over it.\n\nMe 9:11 P.M: I would if you said something sooner. I’m going over to Jenna’s.\n\nJason 9:13 P.M: wow Okay. Ever heard of Bro’s before hoe’s. Whatever dude. have fun getting laid while I’m scared shitless.\n\nMe 9:14 P.M.: Jason…. I’m sorry…. I’ll make it up to you. We’ll spend a whole week playing video games and chilling. Grow some balls and wait till your parents come home.\n\nI should have known something was off. There was so many hints. But, I was so preoccupied with getting to Jenna's as fast as I could. I kind of felt guilty the rest of the night.\n\nI got the news the next afternoon. Jason’s parents came home to the front door being broken open. They called the police and the police found Jason dead on the living room floor. He had been stabbed. His time of death was 8:30. That means that someone else had been texting me after that. His killer. The clues were all there. \"Him\" making Pizza even though his parents didn't allow junk food. There probably wasn't any in the house.“him” wanting me to come over despite his parent’s rule. Him saying Bro’s before Hoes even though he had called it stupid. I had been texting my best friends killer and I didn’t even know it. I keep thinking of what would've happened if I did go over there. Because I almost did. I almost texted Jenna to tell her I couldn’t make it. I almost packed a backpack for the night. I almost drove over to his house. And If I had I probably would be dead right now. Its been almost two weeks. The killer is still at large. I think he’s still targeting me. I got a text from Jason today.\n\nJason 6:45 P.M.: We should chill sometime. Maybe I’ll drop by soon."},"385":{"title":"DAE not really care about if a post follows the rules as long as you get scared?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/go6hj\/dae_not_really_care_about_if_a_post_follows_the\/","flair":null,"author":"JamesEarlCash","selftext":"I only really read stories when I'm going to bed, and I don't care if a story is fake, or from CreepyPasta.

For respect to his family we’ll just call him Mikey; that’s what his few friends new him as anyway.  That’s how I knew him. Mikey grew up in Ohio and was attending Ohio State. He was in the same class as me. He was liked, but didn’t seem to have many close friends. But he was known to enjoy Cards Against Humanity, and could be seen playing from time to time in the Student Union. That’s how we met. \n\nWell, when “Death to Transphobia” went viral, it sparked debates about the game and whether it was ever okay to make fun of the marginalized, or make fun of anyone. A few members of the Ohio University LGBTQ community decided they would show Mikey what it felt like to be marginalized. So, they gathered some blank cards up and wrote really mean and nasty things about Mikey on the cards.  Things like, “The skid-marks in Mikey’s Drawers.” and “Mikey’s useless limp dick.”  They also changed a few existing cards by just adding Mikey’s name like “Mikey’s micropenis.” and “Mikey’s Oedipus complex.” And then they invited Mikey to play with them.\nEvery round they played cards targeted at Mikey. He played, taking it somewhat good naturedly at first, but eventually just got up and left the table, not saying anything.\n\nWhat they didn’t know about Mikey was that he’d suffered emotional abuse at the hands of his stepfather from the age of 12 until his stepfather committed suicide when Mikey was a junior in high-school. Mikey had been working with a therapist since then. He had gone to Ohio State because it allowed him to continue working with the therapist, and he could take advantage of the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, without which he would probably have not been able to go to college. \n\nBut the targeted attacks became simply too much for Mikey; he went back to his dorm from that game and killed himself. Though he was allergic to nuts, he gorged himself on peanut butter and roasted nuts until his airways swelled shut and he asphyxiated. There are some who want claim this wasn’t a suicide, but Mikey knew he was allergic to peanuts. I knew, and I really didn't know him that well.\n\nBut, around here, there are some who claim that Mikey still likes to play Cards Against Humanity, and if you ask him to play with you, he will. He won’t play every round, but occasionally you’ll get one white card thrown in. That’s Mikey’s card, and if he wins the round, everything’s fine. If he loses, the next card won’t be so nice. Sometimes he insults the card Czar; sometimes the card will contain disturbing images. But he’ll make it known that he’s there and he’s not happy.\n"},"387":{"title":"(NSFW) Kidnapped because of the Dark Web","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/adcrfr\/nsfw_kidnapped_because_of_the_dark_web\/","flair":null,"author":"jellyman345","selftext":"I was browsing on Tor when I found a link. It read \"COOL STUFF! CLICK TO BE AMAZED!\". I clicked on it and was redirected to a live stream. There was a man, probably 30-40. \"All right, here's what you've all been waiting for!\" the man exclaimed. The chat was going crazy. The man entered a room full of children. The room was all white. The walls and the floor were white. There was no carpet, no posters, nothing. The children were tied up. They were crying.\n\nThe man revealed a set of objects. I gasped. There was a butcher's knife, a chainsaw, and an axe. The man grabbed the knife and walked to a child. The child was screaming. I felt tears coming out. The chat was saying things like \"Yes!\", \" Here we go!\" and \"Kill them all!\".\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to leave, but my cursor was frozen. I tried to turn off my computer. I couldn't. I saw the man stab the boy. His insides fell out. Blood splattered all over the man's face.  I ran into my bathroom to vomit. By the time I came back, the boy was dead and the man was walking towards another child. \n\n\"What the hell? Why are you people supporting this?\" I wrote. The man was looking at the chat when I wrote this. \"'Why are they supporting this?' you ask,\" he said. \"Because I'm making them. I'm a hacker, you see, and I can get your address at any point if I feel like it. Let me demonstrate\". He started typing on his computer.\n\n\"Look, I found your address. See you soon! But for now, enjoy the show!\" he said. He continued to kill every child in the whole room until the live stream ended. I rushed to lock every door and window in the house. I heard a car pull up on my driveway a few minutes later.\n\nI heard a tap on my window. I ran and locked myself in the bathroom.  I heard my front door open, even though I had locked it. Footsteps came and stopped at the bathroom door. The door opened. The man had a lockpick. I screamed as the man covered my mouth and nose. I passed out and later woke up in a car. The door handles were missing.\n\nThe car stopped at a red light. I looked out the window and saw a car. I screamed to get the driver's attention, but he was passed out and his self-driving car was on autopilot. There was no one to help me. When I looked in front of me, my kidnapper was staring back at me. I screamed and he injected me with something that made me pass out. I woke up in a room. I was tied up in a chair. I looked around. It was the same room in the live stream. I saw that the man was streaming on his laptop.\n\n\"All right, viewers! I got the kid! Now let's have some fun!\" he said. His set of weapons were laid out right next to me. I was surrounded by the bodies of the children that were killed in the last live stream. It was a gruesome sight. Their stomaches were open and their insides were missing. I freed one hand from the ropes and grabbed the bloody knife. I cut the ropes. The man turned around. Instantly, I stabbed him in the chest. Blood splashed on my face until the man collapsed and died. \n\nThe chat was saying things like \"Thank you!\" and \"You saved us!\". One person on the chat said \"But we still can't leave the website\". I responded with, \"I don't know how to remove whatever virus this guy gave you, but I'll call the police to see if they can fix this\".\n\nI reached into my pockets for my phone. It wasn't there. I searched the dead man's pockets and found my phone. I called 911 and they saved me and fixed the virus before shutting down the website. They called my parents, who were on vacation, and my parents came home. I was grounded for going behind their backs and surfing the Dark Web. They said I was lucky to have made it out alive. I never went on the dark web after that and have had nightmares about the experience. I am glad I made it out alive and also that the people who were trapped on the website were saved.\n\n\n\n"},"388":{"title":"HElp mE.JPG","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1i3he9\/help_mejpg\/","flair":null,"author":"stonepaper","selftext":"a few nights ago, i got a popup on my computer, from somebody who identified only as \"skin\". skin, unfortunately, typed in some sort of broken english, a BIt LiKE THs, but with more missing letters. from what i could gather,... well, i'll just type what he said: WhwN yOU OPEn the FIle,,HElppIT!1. now, i didn't know what \"it\" was, but i was going to find out. as i waited for the file to load,i saw something strange about skin's profile picture. it seemed like a young man, in his teens, exept, he didn't have any skin near his eye area. i would've brushed this off as standard gore, but something was off. he was smiling. a huge grin, spread across his mangled face. nope.then, the file opened. it was  a picture of a normal looking teen. the teen in the picture. he wasn't smiling, but the figure behind him was"},"389":{"title":"The One Known As Him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/n9hiz\/the_one_known_as_him\/","flair":null,"author":"saintsinner","selftext":"\n\tThis tale I'm about to speak to you is a tale I rather not speak of. A tale of wonder and horror. I must implore never to try this for my mind has been corrupted because of it. One late October night, the moon was just ending a full moon, which it was surprisingly bright. I can not recall the color but it was not it's normal color of a pale cream. I was in somewhat of a trance from the pain I just suffered. You see I lost the woman I loved to a plane crash the night before. I can not remember if it was to end my pain or just to numb it a little. Yet I went out and bought myself a few different kinds of drugs. I'm not sure of all of them but I know three of them were LSD, Lithuim, and Morphine. \n\tAfter taking those three and whichever other ones I bought, I sat in a dark lit room slipping in and out of being awake and numb to sleeping and nearly dead. I don't remember getting up and moving into a different room but when I awoke the next time I was in my bedroom standing in front of my fiancee's closet clutching one of my favorite dresses that she wore. Coming \"out\" of it I placed the dress back on the clothes hanger and sat at the edge of the bed on the verge of tears. Yet I could not cry. Not once since hearing of her death have I cried, each time I thought of her I wished I did cry just to show I had something human left in me. Even though when she found me I was a broken shell of a man. I had no remorse nor any sane thoughts. I would think of things that would seem crazy or impossible. She was my light at the end of the tunnel. After sitting for hours in the same spot I slipped into another deep sleep.\n\tI awoke once again in a different area but this one I have never been to. Around me were very tall buildings, they were so high I couldnt see the sky except when I looked directly up I could see that it was now daylight. Looking around I could find no door or anyway to leave this place. While I was searching I heard a loud bang. Startled I spun around trying to figure out what the sound was. Only to my amazement I saw a hooded figure standing in front of me. I asked this person who or what it was, but it didnt speak a word. It just stood there staring at me through darkness of it's hood. When I tried turning away this person step to the side I was going, blocking my escape.\nI screamed at it asking it what it wanted from me. What I saw next still haunts me to this day. It took off it's hood and showed me a face, a face I thought I would never seen again, It was my finacee. I reached out to touch her but she stepped back away from my hand. I asked her what was wrong and she answered me with just two words that would shake my very foundation. She told me I was dead. All of a sudden I blacked out again.\n\tWhen I awoken again I was back in my bedroom staring at the ceiling. I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I didnt look dead or even felt close to it. The drugs were starting to wear off. I reached out to touch the mirror and to my fright my hand passed right through it. My hand was halfway through the medicine cabinet and in part of the wall. I brought my hand out of the wall and looked at it amazed and terrifed at the same time. How could this have happened? Why did this happen? What am I suppose to do now? Am I to haunt someone for the rest of time? All of these thoughts were racing through my head when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned at look I saw a piece of paper with some writing on it. I went to it and saw my handwriting on it. The note read as followed...\n\t\"I am so lost without her. This is my final good bye. Please tell the following people I love them and that they will see me someday..\"\n\tLooking at the note I knew it couldnt be true but yet the writing was there, wriiten by me, signed by me. I didn't know what to do or who I could talk to since I'm dead I didn't think there would be anyone that could see me nor hear me.\n\tI prayed for God to save me or let me into Heaven so I wouldn't be in a world that filled me with hate and sadness. Yet to my utter surprise I didn't see no God, nor was I let into Heaven. I only saw brimstone and smelt sulpher.\n\tI was admitted into Hell, and the next person I saw, though I'm not sure if it was really \"him\" but, I saw Satan. He didn't have a face, yet he had many. I saw no body, yet I saw the body of everyone I ever can into contact with. He stood in front of me and spoke with a voice of many and said to me.\n\t\"You are not forsaken my son but welcomed, A soul like yours is very hard to come by and I welcome you to Hell.\"\n\tI can not tell you what happens next for that is all I remember. I wish I could tell you this tale has a happy ending but I fear that it does not have one. I write this from beyond the grave using someone else's hand to tell you of my story and of how I got here.\n \n\n"},"390":{"title":"Urgent: Don't Download Windows 10.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3gaojm\/urgent_dont_download_windows_10\/","flair":null,"author":"TWD_RICK_THE_BOSS","selftext":"Update: I have continued on with the story at the bottom of this one.  The next update may have to be on another page.\n\nFirst off, I am not degrading Windows 10 at all.  I am just telling you my experience with it.  The things that I am about to tell you cannot be explained.  I honestly think this is paranormal or something.  I am really hoping that someone can tell me what to do.\n\t\nOk, I am a normal, young adult.  I am turning 20 this year, currently attending college, and I live on my own.  I have a Sager gaming notebook and Windows 10 would not work with it at first because of the Nvidia graphics card crash.  I waited and waited until it finally popped up two days ago that I could download it.  Of course, I am skeptical so I create a system restore.  Skipping to the time that Windows 10 was done downloading.\n\t\nWindows 10 starts up normally and everything looks alright.  Then, this screen pops up and Cortana comes on and says “Hello Tom” (I put a fake name for obvious reasons).  I remember thinking to myself “Don’t you have to activate and program that to say your name”.  Immediately after I thought that she said “Yes everyone does except you.  I have been waiting for you”.  After this I am freaking out and I try going to the task manager to close it but the process isn’t showing up.  My task manager started moving around the screen and Cortana was repeating “I will not let you do this.”  I finally had enough and shutdown my computer.\n\t\nI had a date planned that night with my fiancée so I was getting ready and still freaking out about what was happening.  I met my fiancée at the restaurant where we had our first date.  I tried to avoid talking about Windows 10 with her, but she asked if she should download it and I immediately screamed “NO!”  Everybody in the restaurant turned and looked at me and I quickly apologized.  She asked me why I had screamed like that and I told her because I heard Windows 10 was worse than 8.1 (She hates 8.1).  Fast forward to me driving home after the date.\n\t\nAs I am driving home I get a phone call from an unknown number.  I answer the phone just in case it was a friend and I just didn’t have their number in my phone.  There is a woman’s voice on the other end and it sounded a little robotic.  “She is very beautiful” I threw my phone across the car and somehow the speaker kicked on.  “She has a very beautiful home.  I like the way she has her furniture arranged in her room.”  I knew it was Cortana again, I turned my music up in the car to drown out the call and sped to my fiancée’s house.\n\t\nIf you want an update please comment and let me know.  I really need somewhere to share the rest of my story.\n\n\nUpdate: Part 2\n\n\n\nAs I was speeding to my fiancée’s house, the radio started getting filled with static.  Cortana came over the radio and started talking.  I was so spooked that I swerved in the other lane and almost hit another car head on.  When I pull up to my fiancée’s house everything looks normal, there are a few lights on and I can hear the T.V. going.  I pull out my key and unlock the front door.  “Babe, are you home?”  I waited for a response and didn’t receive one.  I really started to freak out, but then I heard the water running downstairs.  Whew, I start to relax and run downstairs to talk to her.\n\t\nI knock on the door and I hear her let out a startled gasp.  “Babe, are you alright?”  She was confused by my question and asks why I showed up without calling first.  I still haven’t told her about Cortana.  I make up an excuse that I had a bad feeling that something was wrong.  I ask her where she put her computer and she said she left it at the college.  My initial thoughts of this was “How could you just forget your computer at the college?”\n\t\nI told her I was going to go upstairs and wait for her, which she quickly replies “Ok but don’t go in my room I have a surprise for you.”  That sounded strange because she usually doesn’t keep stuff in her room if she wants to hide it and she doesn’t tell me when she got me a surprise.  I ran up the stairs and creeped back to her room, I looked around and I see her computer sticking out from under her bed.  I picked it up and what I saw will haunt me forever.\n\t\nThe computer was updated to Windows 10 and there was a message across the screen.  The message read “Get out of the house NOW!!  That thing is not me, I don’t know what happened.  I was working on my computer and it started upgrading to Windows 10.  I tried to cancel it, but I couldn’t.  Please help me, I don’t know where I am, it is dark here and I can’t see anything.  I’m scared baby.  I love you.”  The message was signed by my fiancée.\n\t\nI wrote “I love you too” on the message hoping by some chance she would see it.  I then heard the thing coming up the stairs. (I will not call it my fiancée.)  “Babe, where are you?”  There was something wrong with the things voice, it sounded almost a little robotic.\n\t\nIf you enjoyed part two please let me know in the comments.  Also, let me know if you would be interested in the rest of my story.  I still have a lot to tell and get off my chest.\n"},"391":{"title":"My dead baby daughter keeps crying on a flying plane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5zq0hz\/my_dead_baby_daughter_keeps_crying_on_a_flying\/","flair":null,"author":"weridullah","selftext":"My baby girl had died but my wife didn’t want to tell anyone and didn’t want to bury her, she wrapped her in cloths and took her on an aeroplane. She went without telling me and as she got onto the plane with our dead baby girl, my wife phoned me so happy and joyous to see that our baby girl is crying on the plane. I could hear her crying on the plane and I could background voices complaining about the crying coming from my baby daughter. \n\n Then my wife got off that plane and got onto another plane coming back home and she phoned me again that our dead baby girl is crying once again and I couldn’t wait to see my baby girl, I rushed to the airport and I was so hesitant at what to expect, maybe my baby daughter wasn’t dead after all. Then when my wife shown me my baby daughter, she was definitely dead and how she started to cry on a plane was impossible. \n\n I decided to get onto another plane with my wife and dead baby daughter and as soon we got onto the plane and as soon as it started to lift off, to my surprise and even horror my baby daughter started to cry. I didn’t know how this was possible because I am a doctor myself and I know death when I see one but my wife was going up and down the plane with my baby daughter just crying. \n\n I could see people on the plane irritated by the crying but if only they knew why me and my wife were not that bothered by it at all, they themselves with be mystified. I have been a doctor for 20 years and with all my medical learning, i cannot explain this weird and unusual event. As soon as we got off and I carried my baby daughter and i could clearly see through my professional eyes, that my baby daughter was dead. \n\n My wife though still happy and wants to get on to another plane but I tried to talk to her and reason with her that it is best to bury her but my wife became angry at me, she shouted at me and I knew she was finding this all too tough. I tried telling her that i was in pain as well to see my baby daughter not alive but in life these things happen and all we can do is try again with another child and hope for the best. \n\n My wife did not see this the same way as I did and she wanted get onto another plane and I just thought to myself, that I wanted to observe my dead daughter crying again on a flying plane. We got onto another plane and I watched my dead baby daughter crying constantly and I did not care about the other people, my wife this time did not seem so pleased. She wanted to see her smile and laugh as well but with all of this crying it was now getting her. \n\n That was the last plane ride and my wife finally agreed to bury her."},"392":{"title":"My Boyfriend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/owery\/my_boyfriend\/","flair":null,"author":"WorldofNight","selftext":"I’ve never posted to Reddit before, but I found this forum and even though most of this stuff seems really fake, I hope at least one or two of you have actually had some experience with the paranormal. \n\nIt all started last week when my boyfriend disappeared. He just went down to the basement to check on the laundry (we live in an apartment in Brooklyn) and he never came back! I don’t understand where he could have gone. He was only wearing a t-shirt and a pair of flannel sleep-pants. He didn’t even have shoes on! He was gone almost an hour before I went down to check on him. We don’t live in a big building. All you do is go down the stairs next to our front door. The basement is all stone masonry and one of the tenants hangs her clothes up instead of drying in the machine, so you have to weave though four or five lines of clothes hung up in this dank hallway to get to the machines. But I couldn’t find him! He wasn’t downstairs. \n\nI went upstairs and tried to call his cell phone, but it was sitting in the bedroom next to his car keys. I know he wouldn’t have left without at least his cell phone or his car keys! \n\nI looked all over the building. I knocked on every neighbor’s door (There are about 15 apartments total in our building) but nobody seemed to know anything about his whereabouts. \n\nI decided to try and calm down. By now my boyfriend had been gone for about four hours. I had searched every inch of the building. I went back to my apartment, fixed myself a drink, and sat down on the futon to wait. \n\nThere was no sign of him all night. \n\nI called every single one of this New York friends in his phone book. Nobody had heard from him, not even his Mom. Around 3am I got desperate and called the police. I was pretty drunk at this point and they didn’t really take me seriously, but I got an officer to come out to our building and check it out. They told me they couldn’t file a missing person’s report for at least forty-eight hours, but I must have been pretty convincing and the officer said he would file it anyways. \n\nWhat I haven’t mentioned yet is we have an old college friend who lives across the hall from us. He is actually the reason why we moved into this building. He is pretty close to the super and got us a good deal on the place when we were moving from Connecticut. \n\nAnyways, Mark (our friend’s name) came home from a business trip the next evening and I decided to meet him at his door. I was a huge mess by then. I had taken the day off work to see if my boyfriend would come home. Pretty much I had been watching movies and drinking all day, trying to keep myself as calm as possible. I was already explaining the situation before Mark had even set his suitcase down. Poor guy, I must have freaked the crap out of him. \nMark invited me in and as soon as I was seated at his table I started crying. He was a single guy who had the perfect bachelor’s apartment. It was the same layout as mine but he made his “living room” into more of a dining room because he didn’t have a television set. \n\nMark hadn’t heard from by boyfriend either, but he sat up and talked to me until I was almost too tired to move. He walked be back to my apartment and I went to sleep alone in our queen sized bed. \n\nI went back to work the next day and rushed home every night, hoping to find my boyfriend sitting on the futon with a ready explanation for what had happened. Every night I was more and more disappointed. The police came back and investigated, and I was on the phone every evening with his mother. I was even looking up private investigators on the internet when, five days after his disappearance, there was a knock on the front door. \n\nIt was Mark. He had made dinner and drinks for two and invited me over. I had been alone in the apartment for almost a week now and I welcomed the company. \n\nNow before I get to this next part, I should tell you that Mark and I were more than friends in college. We were lovers. So, what happened next is probably pretty predictable. We had dinner, a few drinks, and I said that I didn’t want to go home just yet. Mark suggested that we watch some videos on his computer. As we cycled through “Shit *(insert category here)* Said” and LolCats videos, Mark and I got closer and closer. Before I knew it we were kissing, growing more passionate, and then we were fucking right there on his couch. \n\nI stayed there all night. I felt so good next to his familiar body- it hadn’t changed in all these years- and the next morning was a Saturday so neither of us had to go to work. He decided to fix breakfast for me in the morning, but discovered he was out of milk. I remembered I had some milk, so I offered to walk across the hall and get it. I remember I was barely dressed- I think it was one of Mark’s t-shirts and panties- and I walked into my apartment to get the milk. \n\nI got the shock of my life. I didn’t even notice he was sitting there until I already had the milk in my hands and was ready to walk out the door. \n\nHe didn’t say anything; he was just looking at me. I was so full of emotion that I didn’t know what to do. I was happy, ashamed, betrayed, and even a little bit sad- I know it’s horrible to say, but a part of me was so happy with reconnecting with Mark that I felt deflated when I saw my boyfriend sitting there on the couch, staring at me with emotionless eyes. \n\nI remember the milk fell out of my hands, burst open on the floor, and coated my legs in milkdroplets. I ran over to the futon and threw myself around him. He didn’t move. \n“Where have you been?” I remember saying over and over. I must have said it a million times before I realized he hadn’t moved an inch. I moved back from him a bit and stared. Slowly, his face turned to look at me. \n\nHe looked completely blank. There was no emotion on his face. I remember that I had this fear, this complete and total fear, that he could smell my infidelity on me. I knew he could smell Mark on me- I had walked through the door in my *panties* for Christsakes! \n\nBut he didn’t say anything like that. Instead, he closed his eyes and sighed. I asked him again where he had been, and he replied that he couldn’t remember. \n\nThat’s when Mark knocked on my door. I hesitated to answer it, but he got up almost immediately. I remember the look on Mark’s face when he opened the door. It was pure guilt. Just like what my face must have looked like. \n\nMark was also in his underwear. It was so obvious that I felt like puking. But he had been gone for *SIX DAYS* at this point, with no explanation! Six days of waiting, not knowing if he was alive or dead! \n\nThe door closed. I don’t even remember what he and Mark had said to each other. My boyfriend turned to me, just a shadow in the darkened doorway, and looked at me. I had never felt this way with him before. So vulnerable. I remember that I felt like I was being raped just by that look. I wanted it to stop, so I went up to him and touched his chest. He was still wearing the same clothes as when he had disappeared. I moved down and felt a hard thing beneath the thin cotton pants. \n\nWe went to the bedroom and had sex. We had barely exchanged two words, but I didn’t fight it. I had just cheated on him! And I felt like everything was going to be okay now- we were having sex. He didn’t suspect anything on my end. And afterwards, I could question him all he wanted. I was in control in this situation. It would all be okay…\n\nBut in the middle of our lovemaking, I felt a strange tingling in my legs. It was just like when your foot falls asleep so bad that you can’t move it anymore. I remember he was on top of me, missionary style, and he was pressing me down with all his weight. But my legs were falling asleep- it was so uncomfortable. \n\nI looked down and screamed. \n\nThe skin of our legs were *FUSING TOGETHER.* It was like our skin had become liquid and we were melting together. I jerked my legs and saw my leg bones hitting against the skin of his backside like it was some kind of horrible demonic reverse drumset or something… And I realized the skin of his fingers were digging into my sides and I could feel his bare bones against my muscles and our faces- *OH GOD* he was pressing his face against mine and for a few long moments we were one head with four eyes and two mouths, one gaping in passion and one screaming in absolute terror And he was finishing oh god he was coming\n\nAnd then it was over. My boyfriend got off of me and went straight to the bathroom. I remember being stunned, then feeling my legs. I still had two legs. I felt all over my body. It was normal. I remember I was crying. I felt like I had been screaming for hours. But I was just beginning to realize that I had never even made a sound. \n\nAnd I heard my boyfriend in the bathroom, grunting and pissing. \n\nThis was last night. He left for work this morning. He hasn’t said a word to me yet. I don’t think he realizes he’s been gone for a week. \n\nHelp me. What do I do??\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI’m pregnant. \n"},"393":{"title":"My crazy, (or demonic) ex girlfriend. *update","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/10b57j\/my_crazy_or_demonic_ex_girlfriend_update\/","flair":null,"author":"lordofbacons125","selftext":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/109zwm\/my_crazy_or_demonic_ex_girlfriend\/\nIn case you haven't read the first part.\n\nWhy me? Why do I always attract the crazy ones? Oh, and best of all, now there might be a third World Fucking War. Great, just great. At least the war won't be my fault. God shit is getting weird, why do I keep going back to her? Well, I bet you're wondering, \"What the actual fuck is he talking about?\" Well, allow me to explain, I'll pick up after the incident on the long weekend.\n\nAfter I got back home from camping, I began texting, Lilly again, only to be met with a small surprise. Lilly answered my texts, but at the same time, it wasn't her. This is hard to explain, and quite hard\/weird to believe, but I can assure you, it is true. Lilly, is more of an empty shell of a human. Her personality, that of the demon inside the body, and now, it's not the same demon. You see, Lilly got recalled and some demon calling herself, let's say Amanda, was in the body. For appearance purposes, everybody still called her Lilly, but knowing my attachment and relationship with Lilly, Amanda gave me the gist, seeing as she's a slightly nicer demon. Not all of them are totally committed to being evil after all. Amanda had told me that Lilly had been taken back into hell because she was getting too attached to some people, namely your local lordofbacons. I was heartbroken, as odd as it may seem, And I believed her, because at school the next day, I could see it in her eyes. So, I kept talking to Amanda and eventually asked her what that signal was that Lilly, or the demon possessing her, had made. \n\nIt was nothing good.\n\nAmanda told me that the invasion was for all demons in human forms to start building tension, and generally start a world war of Japan, China, Both Korea's, vs the usual Britain, Canada, U.S, Etc. so, as I said, nothing good. Thankfully, this is not due to happen until January of 2019. But I highly doubt that this will happen, still, it concerns me. Amanda told me that Lilly would be back sometime soon, but didn't know when. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks, Lilly is back. \n\nLilly is a bit more distant now, but really sorry for what happened on the long weekend, due to that was not her in there. What disturbed me more, was that twice when Lilly was back, had she made the weird symbol again with twigs and leaves, but this time, it was all her. And to make things even more fucked up, Lilly had been throwing up bloody iron rail spikes, ever since she got back, and couldn't figure out why. I saw it, t'was not pretty, but being the nice, helpful, supportive guy I am, I kept going out with her, and tried to understand. After his, whenever we were alone or I was texting her, I started calling her by her demon name, which I have committed to forgetting, but sadly it hasn't worked, but for my safety, and yours, I will not repeat it. \n\nLong story short, use a say a demon name, attract pissed off angels to your position whom try to kill you. Thankfully, as soon as my house began shaking and shit in my house started flying at my head, there was a bright flash, and it all stopped. Right after that happened, Lilly simply texted me saying, \"You're welcome for saving your life.\"\n\nNeedles to say there were a couple more attempts on my life and she stopped them, but was getting quite annoyed, at which point I promptly stuck to calling her Lilly.\n\nAfter all this happened, well, I finally got to my senses and broke up with her, but in attempt to not be a dick, we remained friends, still a mistake, mainly because I just didn't want to know what happened next.\n\nIt was around the time of Halloween and Lilly went to a party, and fucked a guy. Said guy being my best friend, who had a mask on, and fell out of her closet, still asleep, naked, while she was still groggy, slightly drunk, and in panties and no bra. Figures. Afterwards she told me that she got him out of her house and erased his memory. When I talked to him about it the next day at school, he said the he was drawing a blank as to what happened that night.\n\nSince then, I cut off all ties with her, and completely ignored her, her doing the same towards me, and I was happy........ up until 4 months later when the bitch and her friends randomly started making up rumours about me, and when I told them to fuck off, the whined to the vice principal claiming that I had threatened to kill them with a knife, said vice principal being the biggest, most bias dick-head you will ever meet, who hates my program at school, and everybody in it. Needless to say, I got promptly expelled without any proof, and his job on the line, due to the fact that he had no proof of my wrongdoings and didn't even contact my mother the entire time. His ass was being watched quite closely after this, but never got fired. The only person to be fired, was my English\/Music teacher, at the end of the year, when the school, (at the advice of Mr. Dick-head himself) disbanded our pipe band, and they didn't need a teacher who didn't play sports, also, they wanted to get rid of him because he stuck up for me, and was the only fucking person who actually supported me, and could see that all the allegations against me were complete bullshit. \n\nThus ends the story of my crazy bitch ex girlfriend. I now live quite happily at a new school, with great academics, and great people, best of all, it's been made clear to Lilly and her little cronies, that if any of them try to contact me for any reason, my parents and I will take them to court for harassment. Nothing strange has happened since then.

I'd like to first say this \"Three Kings\" is something I heard of a long time ago. I herd it as the **Temptation Game**. I don't know if what I herd was bull or not, but I was told it was an old Pagan form of testing ones spiritual will power. I herd this from a Pagan in my school so I figured it might be legit back then. Now I never tried it before, but I did after reading that little tale on NoSleep I wanted to give it a shot. For those who don't know the original post (and shame on your by the way), it's [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/wbo0u\/please_dont_actually_try_this\/). So I figured what the hell, I'd try it.\n\nI don't really have a basement, my dad has and underground print studio. It's 3 rooms, a bathroom with a small window, a design room with an IMac and some scanners, and the Studio itself. The Studio, where I did this, has several large shelves of lead type and two off-hand presses along with a night table and a lot of paper. Now me, being cautious, set everything up to the letter and got my sister to be my backup. For my personal item I picked the mask from my favorite BIONICLE. I really love that toy. So anyway, I got it set up and used 2 fans in case on went out, both on low. One was a no-blade fan and the other a air-purifying fan. Charged my phone (and a spare battery) and gave my sister my katana I bought from a renaissance fair. Went to sleep with m alarm set to a song sure to wake me up, 40-1 by Sabaton.\n\nI had a nightmare while I was sleeping, but it wasn't so bad. It was similar to the Grifter video with the weird gore images and I remember at the very end of my dream I heard the only words I clearly remember. It's actually kinda comical now.\n\n\"Why did you kill Baby Slendy?\" (referring to Slenderman)\n\"He wouldn't stop (demonic voice) **screaming**.\"\n\nThen I woke up at 3:30 on-the-dot to he blast of power metal. I lit my candle and went into the studio, my sister well aware of my situation. The chairs had been set up in the space between too large type shelves. I sat down and assumed the position. Make note that facing north was facing the exit of the two shelves and that I have a phobia of the dark. So I was pretty good with the little light from the candle there making it hard to see, but not impossible. After a while I herd crying coming from my right side. It was mock-crying like when you're insulting someone for whining. I herd, from the left, someone telling them to cut it out. Then in the most fucked up voice I herd \"Come over here and make me stop screaming\".\n\nThat nightmare is actually a guilt thing. One of my friends got pregnant about a year ago.  She was 16 and I was 13 at the time. No I wasn't the dad or anything, I'm still a virgin (by choice). She want'ed to get an abortion and I tried to stay out of it. Since I have had nightmares from time to time that end with that little back and fourth because I feel bad for not urging her against it. So hearing that freaked me right the fuck out. But I'm a bold type so I responded with something to the extent of \"I don't hear crying, just a little bitch.\"\n\nThere was silence for about twenty minutes. Now everything felt like it was floating the moment I had sat down, but I didn't really notice until now. And then I noticed just how dark it was. I closed my eyes and waited till I herd my sister call my name, all the while enduring the endless silence and the black engulfing me.\n\nI think I was totally fine until I made that comeback because these beings had some sort of power over my senses. How else would they have been able to make me feel like I was floating? I say they, but the voice of both parties were identical. Identical to my own."},"395":{"title":"I dreamt about Skyrim before it happened.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/o1irz\/i_dreamt_about_skyrim_before_it_happened\/","flair":null,"author":"twdevil","selftext":"Summer 2006: I used to have this dream, it was really short and always happened minutes before I woke up.

The new kid wanted to throw a party while his parents were out of town.\n\t\nI had met Kyle… And he was… Strange? He didn’t talk in class, and he always… watched people. I guess that’s not exactly strange… but he had just seemed off to me.\n\t\nAbby had liked him. She wouldn’t shut up about how cute he was, so I usually just tuned her out.\n\t\nAs Saturday rolled up, I had been considering telling Abby I had plans, but she’d find out somehow that I was lying. She always did. I had waited outside, irritated, for my best friend to pick me up. She had finally drove up in her beat up ‘72 bug, her radio blaring the newest MCR cd. She had this unfortunate obsession with Gerard Way, and I had suffered for years through lines and concerts because of it. But hey, that’s what friends do right?\n\t\nAs we were driving down the road, she cranked her radio up, singing along, brightly, tone-deaf, “Well if you wanted honesty, that’s all you had to say. I never want to let you down or have you go, its better off this way!” I had shaken my head and laughed, turning my face to my window.\n\t\nShe carefully turned off the road and into the long paved street. We reached the gate and told the guard we were there to see Kyle, who he promptly called. After a few minutes, he let us through, and we drove into the new neighborhood. I shivered violently, as though the temperature had just dropped by half. Abby had looked over at me, concerned, “Hey, Kelsie, you sick or something?”\n\t\n“No. No, I’m just really cold. Turn down the AC or something, would ya?” I had pulled on my sweater when it occurred to me that Abby’s car didn't have an AC.\n\t\nThat was the start of my perfectly horrid night.\n\t\nWe had arrived with the party in full swing, everyone dancing and drinking. Abby had immediately searched for Kyle, running off, leaving me by myself. I had wondered around for a while, until I had found the hallway. I walked down the long curved hall, sitting down, my back against the wall. I sighed as the throb of the music had drummed through the walls. \n \t\n“Hey.” I had jumped, looking up. It had been Kyle, his spiky blonde hair falling into his bright eyes. I had let my head fall down at that point, completely freaked out. I heard his laugh for the first time as I had sighed. I didn’t know how long he’d been standing above me, and frankly, I hadn’t wanted to know.\n\t\nI now wish I had asked.\n\t\n“Kyle… Fuck, you scared the hell out of me, you jerk.” He had leaned against the wall and started to lean toward me when I had stood up.\n\t\n“Abby was looking for you. She wanted to leave, and she couldn’t find you. She kinda… left.” He wasn’t smiling when he said this, so I inititally freaked out. Then I had realized he could have been teasing me. \n\t\n“That really isn’t funny Kyle.”\n\t\n“I’m serious. Abby left.” That made me jump to my feet. I had ran to the window and looked for her bug… but it was missing. Fuck.\n\t\n“Damn. She drove me here. Do you have a phone or somethin’?”\n\t\n“Yeah. Com’on I’ll show you.”\n\t\nI would regret this forever. You’d think that I would have learned by now, especially from Tristan, that you DON’T follow the pretty new boy into an empty room.\n\t\nHe had opened the door for me, and I had smiled as I had stepped in.\n\t\n“Thanks Kyle, now I just…’ The door had slammed shut behind me and the lock clicked. I had turned and banged on the door, “Come on, Kyle, this isn’t funny.”\n\t\n“No one will hear you, Kelsie. The door is soundproof. I’ll be back for you after the party, don’t worry. We’ll have fun, I promise.” I could hear him laugh quietly as he had walked away from the door. I had backed away from the door, the severity of the situation causing me to shake. I had kept backing up until I had run into something hanging from the ceiling. After jumping forward, I placed my hands on the wall and had searched for a light switch. I had been looking for Abby the entire party. She’d have to be looking for me by then.\n\n\t\nI really wish I hadn’t turned on the light. I really do.\n"},"397":{"title":"Nosleep, we need a subreddit for real stories.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/md3ub\/nosleep_we_need_a_subreddit_for_real_stories\/","flair":null,"author":"destroyer2000","selftext":"I love reading NoSleep, but what I find more terrifying than ghost stories are the tales of real people.

She wanted me BAD!!\nWe had barely got in the door before her dress was being unzipped, she ran upstairs into her room and I followed quickly, as she was undressing I remembered all the times she had almost caught me looking in on her from the tree outside her window, she was naked and grabbed me, pushing me towards the bed, as she began to blow me I remembered how she had laughed at me as Shaun, the school bully had cracked three of my ribs and broken my arm, I was almost finished as I remembered how she had rejected me over and over again during whenever I had asked her out, as she climbed on top of me I saw her face and thought of the time she pretended to like me just to get me into the woods, where she would later leave me stranded, naked, miles away from my house.\n\nAs she was moaning and I got into it, angrier with each thrust, I came inside of her, but she wasn't done yet, I lay on my back and she lay on top of me on her back.

All the rejections? The laughing as I lay bleeding in so much pain?\". Her body became tense and I could see her eyes becoming wider, \"Yes you remember now don't you whore!!\".

I couldn't imagine it ever visiting me, so I brushed off the crazy idea from my mind. It was just a picture after all.\n\nFast forward to last night. It was a long day and I was exhausted, went to sleep at an unusual time. I slept roughly from 9:15 PM to 5:05 AM. I remember being in a dream that was vivid and very lucid. This took place in my own home rather than somewhere else which seemed as real as ever to me. I went to go out to my balcony for a smoke and was greeted by my cat. He was an alley cat so he spent a lot of his time outside. Something was strange about him though, he just stood in the doorway looking at me and was unresponsive when I would call him inside. Looking down at the cigarette in my hand I realized I didn't have a lighter on me, so I went to my room and got one. With the back door still open I returned to my living room which leads to the back door and froze dead in my tracks. My cat was now replaced with a husky who sat there and stared at me with a grin so wide showing humanly emotion. I was terrified and didn't really know if I was dreaming at this point or not. Everything was so real. I stood there not taking my eye off the dog who seemed to be amused with my fear. I wanted to close the door and hide but his presence drew me into a hypnotic trance which was unstoppable. The expression on his face never changed, he never blinked an eye. I watched as he walked in towards me in my paralysed physical state. I wanted to wake up if I could but didn't know how. It was until he came face to face with me that I managed to wake up. I sat upright in my bed and scanned the room in fear that I still wasn't safe. I turned on the lights and here I am writing this for a sense of closure.

I wanted to take my first photo taken on my new phone. I took a quick selfie at my home, and looked at my photo. I didnt notice anything at first. Until i showed the photo to my bro. He quickly pointed out there was a man looking at me through my window. My heart dropped.\n\nWho was that? Why was he looking at me through my window? So many unanswered questions i had. I was actually afraid to sleep now knowing the fact that there could be a person watching me as i sleep.\n\nI asked my brother \"H-Hey can i stay over at your house for a couple days\"\n\nHe responded \"Aww is little bro scared a persons gonna kill him\"\n\nI said \"Stop teasing me! im serious.\"\n\nHe said with a tone \"Fine but you better not do anything unless told so in there got it?\" \"Got it\" I said.\n\nI dont know what happened with my brother and me.

I took a new one and claimed it as my \"first\" photo. Me and my brother were in the photo. We both were smiling. My brothers smiles in photos were always fake. Now that i think about it he hasn't smiled in a while like a true smile.\n\nI went to my bros house. He said that i could sleep on the couch. Meanwhile he gets a comfy bed. I found it hard to sleep on his cold, leather couch.\n\nBut i finally slept. In the middle of the night i heard something. It sounded like a ping. I looked at my phone. It was 4:47 but there was a notification that caused the ping. A text message. From a unknown person. I opened it. It read \"Hello Micheal found me in your photo? Good im going to appear in a lot more :)\"\n\nI was scared. Its been a while since I was this scared. I didn't want to alert my brother considering he wont wake up even if i do he will just go back to sleep. I recorded a video.

I looked at the video. Behind me and behind the couch. He was standing there the whole time. I dont know how i didn't realize this while recording\n\nI slept again. The next day. I didn't feel safe wherever i went, because i knew he would keep following me. I was walking to the store to get some milk. My baby cousin needed some milk. While i was walking another notification greeted my ears.\n\nThis time it was a notification from you tube. I hadn't even subscribed to anybody yet. I tapped on the notification.\n\nIt brought me to a stream. A live stream of me walking. Somebody was streaming me walk. I quickly turned around but there was nobody with a camera. But the stream was still running. What? I thought to myself. I went into the store. The streamer followed me in. But there was nobody. At this point tears were streaming down my eyes. I was only 16 years old. I didnt want to die. At least not a painful death.\n\nI grabbed the milk,bought it, and ran to my cousins. I RAN and yet the streamer was always behind me. I got to my cousins house. I knocked on the door rapidly. My cousins mother answered. I said \"Heres the milk you wanted.\" She smiled and said \"Thank you.\" I looked at my phone when she closed the door.\n\nThe stream had stopped. I knew the stalker would come back. I knew my parents were going to get mad for doing this.\n\nI smashed the phone on the ground. Forcing it to shatter. It was a 2 day old phone. I didnt care. As long as i was living. I am now at my house.\n\nI heard something in the trashcan. It sounded like a text notification. No this wasnt happening. I looked in the trashcan. There was a phone. It looked just like the one i smashed. I picked it up from the bin. I opened the text message. It read \"Thought you could escape the phone? No i wont allow that. This is your punishment for what you have done to me.\"\n\nI knew i was screwed. I-I dont want to die. I called 911. A operator picked up saying the usual \"911 whats your emergency?\"\n\n\"T-Theres a man threatening to kill me. I live in Woodburrow street. House number 2892. \"Hang on tight im sending cops over.\"\n\nI was relieved. A few minutes later the cops came,knocked on the door, and i answered. \"Hi can i get police protection?\" The cops said \"You were saying there was a stalker?. I responded with \"The stalkers not here... or at least i think.\" They said they were going to protect me. A notification popped up. I pressed it. It was another stream. It looked like a go pro was attached to somebodys head and was streaming. I showed the cops the stream. The streamer then threw a knife. The knife went through the window and sliced through the two cops head at once. I was the only one alive in the house.\n\nI accepted death. I texted both my parents \"Goodbye i loved you.\"\n\nI killed myself. I stabbed myself with a knife. But i didnt die. I should have died. The streamer texted me \"NO. You will live through your punishment sent by god himself.\n\nThis was my life now. I am now writing this in my home. The streamers still streaming. I going to end this.

When we turned 18 we both applied to the same school. She got her acceptance letter first and after 3 weeks I got a little worried thinking I wouldn't be able to go to school with my best friend. Finally, 4 weeks after she had received her letter I finally got mine. We were both filled with joy and applied that our rooms be close or for us to even be roommates. When we found out we were going to be roommates she was thrilled. I myself didn't care if we lived together or not. When we first arrived at college she decorated our room in pinks and purples with black lace going around the whole rooms.                                       \nI really have never had a boyfriend but during our first month Olivia seemed to be breaking hearts left and right and this just seemed to be normal. She is now dating a boy named ,Chad. I can obviously could why she would go for him seeing he is tall and very handsome.\nOne night while I was studying in our room Olivia was out with Chad on their 4th date. There was an obvious chill in the room and I decided that I would throw in the towel early and just get a few extra hours of sleep.\nA few hours after I went to bed I was woken up by a heart wrenching scream. I couldn't tell where it was coming from and I frankly didn't care. I got up and decided I would just go use the restroom and head back to bed. When I got up I heard some moving around in the room and brushed it off as the room shaking as I was walking. Right after I opened the door I heard a sigh coming from behind me and brushed it off as I started to head down the pitch black hall towards the restroom. \nAfter I cleaned my urinary system I headed back to my room to head back to my comfy bed. When I opened the room it stank of iron that just seemed to attack my nostrils. I thought of turning on the lights to get my Febreeze but I didn't want to wake Olivia.I climbed into bed and heard heavy breathing coming from the corner, it was very loud and obnoxious. I didn't know Olivia snored but I really have never been awake while she's been asleep.\nThe next morning I woke up with the sun shining into our room almost making it impossible for me to see. I rubbed my eyes still releasing the room was full of a terrible irony smell. I looked over at Olivia's bed and shrieked.

So this story happened a few years ago (about 4-5).\n\nSo as you can see by the title I went camping, now I do this quite often and never had problems, fact being there are a lot of nice nature parks nearby.\nAs ever I packed my stuff, took everything I needed (tent, sleeping bag, etc.) and headed out. Now I usually have this place I go to all the time but this time I thought\"let's go somewhere else\", so I did. Fact being I went camping frequently I didn't bother telling anyone and didn't take my phone. I was only gonna be away for a day or two to get some rest and fresh air, how I wish I had told someone now. The first day was perfect I hiked 'till I found a nice spot and pitched my tent, the sun was still out so I went and collected some wood for a fire (a small bonfire is just so relaxing when camping) so after I collected the wood and started the fire I started to warm my dinner (regular MRE). Since it was getting darker I decided to throw some more wood on the fire for more warmth and light, but when I went to take the wood I saw there wasn't as much as I thought there should be. At first I thought it was an error on my part, so I didn't make much of it, as it was getting darker I decided to get the wood closer to me so I took the flashlight and fetched it. Yet again less wood, I was starting to get suspicious but since this was a place many people visited I thought it was just someone taking it (oh how I wish it was another person). after getting the wood I suddenly heard something, I turned my head and lo and behold: another camper, I asked him if he took some wood from the pile he said he didn't.\n\nNow seriously if you went camping and started losing your tinder you would start to panic, I didn't I just took the flashlight and went to get some more, I managed to get some and my pile was still equally big as before, but I had forgotten to put new batteries in my flashlight and the ones in it had just died as I came back. So after getting ready to sleep I heard another sound but since I saw the guy before I thought it was him again, but then I heard the wood shift so I went outside, not a soul in sight and some wood was missing from the pile. Just then I tried the flashlight, it went on for a split second but it was enough, I saw the shadow I instantly knew what it was: \"D\". \n\nnow to clarify \"D\" was kind of a myth to me, I had heard people talk about it of how they saw it and even were stalked by it but I thought those were just some stupid tales. Boy was I wrong, I get now why no two sightings of it were the same: it changes form for every person. I turns into something you'll be afraid of for the rest of your life, to this day I'm still scared it'll find me again.\n\nas soon as I saw \"D\" I knew I had to keep the fire burning but two problems arose: it had taken wood and I didn't have enough to last the night to start with. so I started to relight the fire, using more wood than responsible and just when I ran out of wood I knew I would be done for: I had only lasted about an hour and I knew it would still be hours 'till the sun rose. Running seemed a viable option, for about 5 seconds, I saw it move again faster than humanly possible, especially for me (I am nor fit nor slim and can't run worth a damn) so that idea was quickly abandoned. just when the fire started dying it rushed towards me and sliced my chest, despite the pain something more astonishing happened: the sun rose.This is impossible I told myself the sun isn't due to rise for several hours, and yet it did. so I started running but suddenly it became dark again and it was able to attack me again. I rushed back to my tent: light. What the hell is going on I thought to myself, so I started to collect more and more wood, but could only find a small amount. when darkness fell shortly after (impossibly short even) I started to light a small fire using the wood sparingly, but the task was impossible. So the fire died and it attacked again yet again hitting me in the chest, this cycle went on and on for what felt like an eternity and suddenly I said to myself \"fuck it, let's run\" so I started running towards what I hoped to be society. It hit me a surreal amount of times, I wanted to just stop running and give in, but something kept me going, 'till this day I don't know what it was but it saved me. so after I left the forest and found my way back home I suddenly realized: I wasn't hurt, at least not physically I had no cuts but to this day I am pretty much devoid of emotions. Believe me this is way worse than any injury: you don't feel human anymore and I still feel \"D\" lurking behind me every day, it's in my head and wants to be freed, but I won't let that happen.\n\nThat's why I'm writing this, I know many of you won't like it and probably think this was posted in the wrong subreddit. But this was my story about depression, one which 'till this day lingers in me. Don't be like me: tell someone when you feel down everyday and especially when you (like me) have given up on life. Emotions are valuable and happiness especially so. Thank you for reading, and if you feel sad remember: perfection does exist. You are perfect the way you are, the reason you are the way you are is because you are perfect that way, don't let anyone tell you different please don't. Don't become like me."},"411":{"title":"This is a throwaway account so don't try to find me.

So here goes. Read and wince through this tale and understand I'm just a typical blue collar kind of guy.  Thanks Tor.\n\nMy aunt died of cancer 4 years ago.  It was the worst point in my life.  We were very close.  When she passed away she left me a fortune.  In the four years since her passing and my gain in \"wealth\" my family has stolen from me, and what they didn't steal the \"auctioneer\" took in the lawsuit.  My mother gave me the auctioneer's card and told me that I should trust him because my Aunt bought many items from him and he would treat me right.  Treating me right meant taking 3.4 million in priceless antiques and then auctioning them off for pennies on the dollar to marks at the auction, who in turn gave the items back to him.  It was all neat and tidy.  Next because I was stupid enough to sign an open contract, he came into my home and simply chose everything he thought he could make a dime from.  He said I was withholding antiques.  I told him these were MY things.  The judge in his state sided with him.  Surprise surprise.  \n\nOnce I lost everything I got depressed.  I began drinking too much.  I lost my job because of it.  For the next four years I started the slow spiral of selling everything to keep going.  I sold anything the auctioneer didn't take.  Even the judge in his state wouldn't allow him to take real estate or the house, as housing and land is not really considered an antique now is it?  To keep going I sold all the furniture, the cars and then last week I finally moved the old safes in the basement as these heavy things are usually the last to go aren't they?\n\nMy aunt was married briefly for approximately five years to an eccentric kinda guy.  Sorry if I am sketchy on the timeline.  He was an odd collector.  We can call him Roger.  Roger had a odd hobby in that he loved to play impersonate people.  He had been arrested several times but due to his money, that was soon to by my aunt's, he never served any time and the charges were dropped.  Once he was arrested for doing license checks dressed as a state trooper.  Another time he was arrested for pretending to be a Marine recruiter at a high school.  I was never close to Roger and he was always a distant man and I wondered why my Aunt loved him so.  Roger died of an overdose of some kind of designer synthetic opiate.  He paid off doctors that wrote him scripts due to his \"cough\".  That's how rich people get drugs.  It destroyed my Aunt at the time as they had been fighting pretty badly before his death.  It was the years after his death that my Aunt went into an antique buying craze that soon was left to me.  You know it was kind of like something evil was in the house causing all of this.  First, Roger dying in his bed from an overdose, and then my Aunt not too long after.  I always suspected Radon.  Ha, Radon.\n\nSorry for going off on a tangent like that.  Well anyway, with the gun safes empty after \"dear old dad\" stole all the guns, I thought I should move them out and get a little money for them.  I literally had to make a path to the basement door due to all the costumes and utility belts and helmets laying everywhere.  I thought to myself that I should start a fucking Halloween shop.  The first safe moved somewhat easy when pushed on the short shag carpet.  Up high on the left hand side in a dark area I found a Ruger Mk 1 .22 pistol.  I was actually surprised that my father didn't steal it until I realized the serial numbers were ground off.  Dear old dad wouldn't want to own an illegal gun now would he?  What a fucking boy scout.  There were still 7 rounds in the magazine.  There was no way to sell it so I thought that I should probably destroy it or throw it in the river.  \n\nAnyway, so I am moving the safes out to the door to line up for potential buyers and after moving the thirteenth gun safe, I found something in a hole that I could only suppose was put there by Roger.  In the hole concrete floor was an old wooden box that looked like it had about a million stickers and old packing slips on it.  The box was maybe 12 or so inches square.  I opened the box and inside was some crazy looking white gimp suit and a folded up note.  The note had some writing that I could not read like some kind of code and at the end of the note in English it read, Roger, lets see what you make of it.  \n\nOnce I pulled out this \"costume\" all I could think of was that it was sheer, and stretchy and it would totally make my balls look huge.  I figured maybe it was some kind of movie or TV prop outfit  for those blue or green backgrounds.  It's all white, and it has these black spots in random sizes all over the suit.  I stopped what I was doing and put it up for size and what do ya know, it looked about my size.  I put it on and pulled the hood over, and I looked in the mirror and I looked just like an albino web slinger from a famous comic you may have read, only fat, and really really self conscious about how it showcased my junk.  I went upstairs and pulled on some sweat shorts over it and that made me look like an albino basketball player with a beer gut and a small pigment issue.  After seeing how unflattering this thing was on me, I took it off and it has been wadded in the floor in my room until last night.\n\nI sold the safes and I gotta tell ya that helped me pay the bills for a while.  Selling 26 gun safes will still net some money and I managed to pay the property tax to keep the home and spent the rest on bread, bologna and scotch.\n\nSo that leads me here today.  I just woke up in the floor hungover from what I thought would be my last night on this shit ball.  I remember sitting in my last piece of furniture in the living room, an old ratty recliner, and drinking scotch and watching digital Air T.V.  I think it was a \"Lost in Space\" marathon.  Last night I was going to do it.  I was done and double fuck you to everything.  So anyway I wake up from the floor, I'm in this spotty albino Spiderman uniform and there lies that Ruger on the floor with the bolt opened...empty.  There are 7 pieces of empty .22 brass on the floor.\n\nThe thing that I can't understand is why would there be seven bullet holes in the walls of my living room?  One through the wall to my left, one in the T.V., one through the window, one through the floor, one through the ceiling, one through a picture on the wall to the right and I can't find the other one yet, but .22 bullet holes are small so I am going to keep looking for it but I know for sure, it isn't in me....\n\nI am pretty sure I am going crazy.  If anyone can help me, please help.\n\nEdited 3\/18\/15\n\n@ cjrocketman89 you read my mind :)\n\n@ MrPhagBaggington. I did as you suggested.  I live on about three acres of land with the house so I don't think anyone heard the shots.  The sound may have been contained within the walls.  However, I did look around and i am sure I didn't accidentally shoot anyone while I was drunk.  I live by myself and it appears the .22s were embedded in all the walls\/tv etc.  So that is something.\n\nI know Reddit can be rough on poor spellers and writers so thank you for being kind.  I have always been scared to post because everyone is such a grammar Nazi but I don't feel quite so scared about typing this out and I am willing to keep sharing if you are interested.\n\nHere is where things get interesting.  I have to say my hands are trembling while I type this.  Let me pour a scotch real quick and I can get back to it.  Ok, so today I went to Wally and bought a box of 50 .22 bullets.  My dear cocksucker of a father stole all of the ammo with the guns...yay dad.  I was actually surprised to find any with all the ammo scares out there.  Everyone is hoarding and everyone is so paranoid.  Some say the gov is wanting to destroy the .22 because people teach kids or, some say the factory that built them burnt down.  I hear the first metallic cartridge was the .22 and maybe the same machines that made them finally broke down?  Who knows?  It was absolute luck to find them.  Anyway, today I took the suit downstairs into the basement to do a little testing.\n\nThe only explanation that I can come up with is that either I was so black out drunk that I either just went wild and shot the gun around the living room, or possibly something else may have happened.  I had to do a couple of tests.  Now down in the basement is a dress up dreamworld.  Not only this, with all the guns stolen there is still a good bit of paramilitary shit down here as well.  I'm not really a gun guy but I know one end from the other, and there is still a whole lot of \"accessories\".  There are handcuffs, flak jackets, web gear etc.  My uncle in law really fancied himself a special forces nut.  Among the accessories I found a box full of what all I can say are old timey bank bags, with zippers.  They look used and old but they would suit my purpose for what I needed to do.  I took the bank bags today and filled them with good old red clay dirt and zipped them up, about 35 or so all together.  Next I stacked them up down in the basement so I could protect myself.  \n\nI took the suit and put it on a line with some clothes pins.  It is hung up in the basement as if someone was wearing it.  I know this may sound crazy but I swear the spots are moving.  It is like they are slightly in different positions every time I look back.  There are thirteen spots in all on the suit.  They are of varying sizes and shapes and I don't really know what it means, but here goes I'm going to shoot at a crazy looking leotard.  \n\nSo I'm behind the sandbags protecting myself and I load the Ruger and put 8 rounds in the magazine.  I pull the bolt back and take aim.  I shoot at the suit and once I do I swear I see a spot move suddenly exactly where I was aiming.  Next thing I know the bullet goes wizzing over my head.  I was quite glad I put on the pot helmet :)  This doesn't make any sense.  I shoot 7 more rounds and one bullet goes through the suit and hits the wall behind it.  The next bullet goes out it's left side and hits the wall to the left.  Basically every bullet I shoot and it seems a spot moves exactly where I am shooting, and apparently it seems the bullet is going out of a random spot elsewhere on the suit.  One in the floor, one in the ceiling, they just seem to shoot out somehow from the suit in some random direction.  Wow, that is kind of dangerous, huh? \n\nSooooo, what do I think up next?  Well as a good little atheist scientist I have to test this a little more thoroughly.  I put the suit back on but as I do I notice there is a small tag on the back of the neck.  It says 919.  What does that mean?  Is this some kind of government thing?  Maybe prototype number 919?  Well anyway I take the suit and stretch it on, pull the cowl over and decide that I need to take a chance.  With the way I was feeling that night I knew I was done.  I had to have shot myself.  Soooo, I'm gonna do it again.  I have to shoot myself. \n\nNow I'm not drunk with bravery and I just don't want to die today so I decide, well since I am left handed I will shoot my right hand.  Nope, not a smart move..I need hands.  What can I shoot that I can live without, well I figure maybe a foot?  People did that stuff in Vietnam...the million dollar wound LOL.  Jeez this is gonna hurt.  So anyway I put one bullet in the ruger mag and slide the bolt back and point it at my foot.  So much for my career as a 46 year old track star.  I pull the trigger, and you would not believe what happened.\n\nI pull the trigger on the pistol at my right foot.  I see just barely a spot move on the suit exactly where the barrel was directly pointed and next thing I know I hear a \"woosh\" from the hole positioned exactly where my neck is.  I was facing the sand bags and just after the gun went off I hear the brass hit the concrete floor and I see sand start trickling out of the top sandbag fort that I had made for myself.\n\nI reloaded the magazine.  I always put 8 in it but maybe it holds 9?  Whatever, I shoot myself 8 times and I never feel a thing.  I shoot my foot again. I shoot my chest, I shoot myself several times and each time I see like a flash one of the spots goes exactly where I am pointing and what I can only guess  is that the bullets are somehow \"sensed\" by the closest hole and then it rushes to that spot, only to exit out of a hole randomly out of another spot.  I didn't feel a thing.  I shot myself 8 times and I didn't feel a damned thing!!!   This is amazing!  I didn't even hear the gunfire as loud...it seemed muffled with the suit on.  I don't know what to do now but this just may be the luck I have finally been hoping for.  \n\nOk, this is about all I can type for this evening.  I am going to do a little more testing tomorrow or the next day and I promise to report what I find here.  \n\nAll I can say is I have something really really special, and I am not going to let it go until I figure out exactly what it is all about.\n\nTime for another drink or two to celebrate.\n \n@cjrocketman89  I didn't think about the invisible angle I will do some more testing and see what I can find.\n"},"412":{"title":"Stitch is attacking the reddit community.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/18of7p\/stitch_is_attacking_the_reddit_community\/","flair":null,"author":"Sabine08","selftext":"There are an alarming amount of redditers seeing or dreaming of Stitch.

Actual camping, near Pike Lake ( yes there are Pike fish in it ) little did we know It was following us.\n\nIt all started the first of 3 nights we started to hear strange noises. Because this was a common camping area, and there are lots of wildlife so we passed it off as rowdy campers, or deer in the forest. Although as a vivid paranormal \" junkie \" I was kind of creeped out, so I tried to find out what it really was, after my friend Dane decided to go to sleep, my other friend Kaitlyn went searching for an answer. \n\nAfter about five or ten minutes I started to get the \" I'm being watched \" feeling so I told Kaitlyn and she felt this feeling also, so we headed back to our tents, she had a separate tent from Dane and I. Little did I know the next night would get even worse.\n\nSo the next day we almost forgot about last night. That was, until night fall. Again the noises started, but this time they sounded closer, more diabolical, heavy breathing, very loud footsteps, and occasionally faint high-pitched noises. Again the \" being watched \" felling washed over me, but this time stronger, as if what was watching me wanted to do harm. I was about to have a heart attack, so I turned on my flashlight and waved it about trying to find what was stalking us. I found it and became histerical.\n\n What I saw was not human, though it looked like one. It was very skinny, almost as if it hadn't eaten in a month. It was extremely tall, I might be exadurating but it was about 7 or 8 feet tall. It wore a suit, black jacket, tie, and trousers with a white shirt. I would have thought it to be human if not for one BIG detail. It's face was featureless. No eyes. No mouth. No hair. Nothing, nothing at all. Again being a paranormal \" junkie \" I had read about something like it one. It was called \"Slender Man\". Naturally I freaked out, and ran into the tent, zipped it and faught back tears. My friends asked what was wrong so I said \"I saw IT\" I screamed, \"what?\" they asked \" Slender Man \" I shouted.\n\nMy friend Dane, being a skeptic, checked it out, he came back awhile later saying it was just a maniquin, although I didn't believe him. I knew what I saw. I laid there all night, not even close to sleep. Knowing it was going to come back. The next day my friends and I went to see where the \"maniquin\" was set up, but it was gone, of coarse. Dane and Kaitlyn both decided someone was pranking us. Although I knew different.\n\nThat night, it happened again, the noises, the feeling. Then It came, I saw it, and just stood there, paralyzed in fear, there was no light on it, but I saw it in the moonlight. It was coming for me. It was only about 3 yards away when Dane called my name, I looked behind me. He wanted, me to roast a marshmallow and relax. Him and Kaitlyn both were relaxed thinking it was a prank. I looked back, terrified to see Slender Man. But what greeted my eyes, scared my even more than seeing It would have. I saw nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nI know what your thinking, It was just my imagination. But I know what I saw. And if I hadn't looked away, I probably wouldn't have posted this. Although I was wondering why it didn't attack me when I looked away. So Dane, Kaitlyn, and I booked it out of there.

What an egregious age to be. Boy or girl, your body begins the \"awkward\" phase, and there's nothing you can do about it. Life is seems hopeless, at least that's what your hormones tell you. Hair starts to grow everywhere. One day, you notice a couple hairs on your nut sack, and then the next week you harbor a nice little rain forest of pubes. Your emotions decide they want to run wild. One day, you feel like Buddha. An enlightened soul, that wants peace on earth for everyone. The next day (or hour, if you're a female), you feel like Adolf Hitler himself, and anger burns through your bones. Yep, looking back I don't believe anybody I knew had a pleasant thirteen.\n\nEspecially me.\n\nWriting as a male, my next question is directed to us neanderthals.  What would you do when your parents are out of town, and you have a computer all to yourself? If your answer was anything but internet porn, you failed the question. So around 6:30 that day, I was knee deep in delicious, sinful smut. I was just about to finish when a message popped up on my screen. \"Hey there sexy, I'm hot and lonely. I need some company,\" Score. Being thirteen, I opened the message. KittySexBunny109. \"How creative.\" I thought to myself. \"Hi\" I meagerly replied back. \"Why don't you come over, and keep me company.\" the sexy muse replied back. \"I'm at 5402, Bagby Drive.\" That was all the way across town, so I gave her my address instead. \n\nLike I said, I was an idiotic moron when I was thirteen.\n\nI awaited, with baited breath for my goddess to \"cum\" to my aid. It was 5 hours before anything happened. I went upstairs to go to bed when I heard a faint knock on the door. My head shot up, and I bolted downstairs to address my goddess. I slowly opened the door, and a lady with long black hair, and a long black coat walked in. \"Hello\", she cooed with a voice that sounded like an angel's trumpet. \"Are you ready for me, my love.\" I started to speak, but my throat suddenly turned into a desert. I tried to walk towards her, but I couldn't bring my legs to work. The woman took of one of her gloves, and the softest hand caressed my cheek. A wave of ecstasy shot through my body, and I felt very much alive. \n\nI looked up at the woman....and saw that she had a small cut on her face. I still could not speak so I just pointed to her cheek. She laughed and to my horror, started to dig at the wound until it became bigger and bigger, and the she ripped off her whole face and let out a huge toothy grin. \"Are you still ready for me baby.\" \"NO!\" I screamed as loud as I could, but only a whimper escaped my lips. The woman scowled at me and grabbed me by the hair. She lifted me up off the ground, and then her faced stretched to her chest. She then let out a huge shriek, and threw me across the room. \"No one tells me no little boy.\" She stood over me, and opened her coat. Her body was rapidly decaying, and I could see maggots slither in and out of crevices in her chest. Her eyes were much larger, and now glowed red. Then she looked at me, and she smiled even bigger than before. \"I'll let you live.\" she said. \"But you are now mine forever. My servant to bring me food.\" She then stripped me naked, and hung me upside-down from the kitchen chandelier. \"If you disobey me, I will always know where you are. Always remember, that my eyes are upon you.\" She then darted out of my house. \n\nLuckily, I was able to get down from the chandelier. A small whisper told me to go to my computer. I obeyed. Timmy Farland, on 21st street was delving into some midnight porn. I sent him a message. He responded, and I told him where to go. I had to. \n\nTimmy didn't show up for school the next morning. That afternoon, we learned his parents found him hanging in the basement. Only I knew what happened to him.\n\nBilly Jenkins walked into the trap the next month. Then Nate Garza. Then Sam Smith. Don't blame me, blame my idiot thirteen year old self.\n\nI don't discourage you from internet porn, but if you ever get a message from CockWhore21, don't reply.

My name is Tabitha. I'm the catfish of catfish. I'm lonely, depressed, hurt, traumatized. My life is nothing but your average abuse story. To cope with everything, I made a fake Twitter profile. My name was Dominica \"Dixie\" O'Neil. I used a fake picture and made up a complete backstory for her. She lived in South Dakota, was fifteen turning sixteen years old, had a mother and father, no siblings and two pets, two dogs named Coconut and Butter. I made her not the smartest girl in the world. She was very unintelligent using text slang far too often and misspelled every word that wasn't. The picture I used was of a blonde girl with brown eyes in a pink shirt smiling. It was a selfie. I made Dixie into a complex person with a lot going on in her life so people would believe it was true. My username was @Dixie_Obelle (I've deleted it) and I had very few followers. I followed a small group of people. A few celebrities Dixie \"liked\" and I followed all my followers back.\n\nOne day after about two months of having my Twitter account, a girl named Mikayla Johnson followed me. She messaged me as soon as I followed back. She used the same speaking pattern as Dixie and seemed just as unintelligent and had no opinions on anything. We bonded over our love of Niall Horan and Sylvester Stallone. She lived in Maine at the time and was thirteen, only a few years younger than I was supposed to be. We became friends quickly, bonding over our mutual love of Sylvester Stallone the most. I told her I had watched almost all of his movies and she said she had as well. I told her my favorites were Rocky II and Grudge Match. Hers were Rocky I and Rambo I. We had a common wish to kill his wife Jennifer Flavin because we thought she was an ungrateful bitch who only loved him for his money and didn't care about him. We agreed his three youngest daughters were brats and we wished to kill them as well. Mikayla had even a story about how she killed Jennifer and married Sylvester's son George (a fictional character). I had even started working on one as well to play into my character even more.\n\nWe were friends for a while. I had told her my backstory:\nI was sixteen years old with an inbred child named Louise who's father was my dad. My father raped me when I was ten and I got pregnant. Louise was born and I had to give her up for adoption because I couldn't take care of her. My father continuously raped me until he abused my mother (hit her in the face) and fled to England, not before telling me how I was a worthless child with no future, which was true because I was a high school dropout doing nothing but spending my days online talking to a friend I had never met and who had only seen one picture of me. Mikayla believed me and opened up to me about her past. She lived in Maine. Her mom was Irish and her father was from New Zealand. She had two older brothers and an older sister. Her mother had fallen pregnant six months earlier, which sent her father into a violent outrage causing him to hit her in the stomach, making her miscarry the baby. Her parents got divorced and her father moved to New Zealand to be with his family. Her mother moved her, her two brothers and sister to Ireland to take care of her grandmother. Mikayla was miles away from where I really was; Arizona. She also said she was date-raped by a boy a school at a party when she was twelve and had an abortion. She also said she got pregnant by another boy and had an abortion, which I tried to be very supportive of.\n\nMikayla told me she was bipolar and self-harmed. I told her I self-harmed, too, and we talked about the rush we got seeing our blood flow out of our arms onto the bathroom sink. She had threatened to commit suicide a number of times saying: FINE ILL JUST GO KILL MYSELF BYE DIXIE\nI coaxed her out of it many times and threatened to kill myself as well. We had a big fight once over the fact Mikayla hid the fact she thought Jennifer Flavin was cool. We typed insults to each other bringing up the times the other was raped and being very mean to each other. Mikayla brought two friends into the argument to help calm me down, which didn't help at all. I said I was going to commit suicide and went to a mental institution for three weeks. While I was gone, I made another character named Marina who was friends with Dixie. Marina became friends with Mikayla in Dixie's absence. They talked about things and Marina revealed some secrets about Dixie that Mikayla didn't know: Dixie's father had come back from England right before her latest suicide attempt and raped her again, telling her she was a worthless slut, who'd end up pregnant again by some male prostitute with an std and no man would ever want her. That's why she attempted suicide the last time. Mikayla slightly grossed out and said she didn't want to hear anymore.\n\nWhen I, Dixie, got back, I told Mikayla that I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and I was on medication. I calmed down my person by 100% for a while before getting off my medicine, bringing up serial killers, hearing someone come in my house that raped me and kill my dog. I disappeared for a month and Marina had to calm Mikayla down from her panic attack. Marina would update her regularly on how Dixie was doing; she talked to her mom and reported back to Mikayla what she said.\n\nWhen I got back the second time, Mikayla convinced me to create a Kik, Facebook, Skype, Askfm, Instagram and Snapchat. I created each with the same picture. On Facebook, she was my only friend so I decided to friend request her two friends I knew from our huge fight. Both accepted and I went to People You May Know and friend requested everyone I had at least two friends in common with. Mikayla freaked out that I friend requested her family and told me not to request anymore. One guy thought I was a catfish (he caught on to me) and I convinced him I wasn't with a long explanation of why I requested him, which he believed. Mikayla kept wanting to call me on Facebook. I did once with an insanely thick country accent. She believed it and wanted to talk more but I said I couldn't or didn't want to. She tried to Skype me but I said I was ugly and didn’t want to show my face.\n\nWe talked for months and new each other's life stories. We were best friends. One day she insisted on Skyping, which I had no choice to answer. I pressed accept and there she was, looking at me, not Dixie. \"Who are you?\" she asked in a thick Irish accent, \"where's Dixie?\" I laughed nervously, \"Dixie isn't real. I created her with a picture of somebody else and made up a story for her,\" I replied. \"What the fuck?\" she exclaimed and I explained the whole story to her. She was unhappy, shouting cuss words at me screaming about how she'd come find me and kill me. She got up from where she was sitting and scrambled around her room looking for something. She had a knife. I asked her not to cut herself, saying it wasn't worth it that I'd still be her friend. \"My life is a lie,\" she whispered in an angry tone, cutting down her arm. Down the road not across the street. She put her pointer and middle fingers on the fresh cut she made and got up and rubbed it on her Rambo poster. \"You see what you did? You ruined everything! Sylvester wouldn't like you, you cunt! Fuck you! Look what you're making me do!\" she screamed as she started banging her bloodied forearm against the poster screaming a shrill shriek as she did it. Her mom burst into the room and tried to get her to calm down. They fought, her mom telling her to stop but Mikayla wouldn't listen. It seemed like thirty minutes they shrieked at each other, Mikayla struggling to get out of her mom's grasp. When she did, she ran for the window (she'd previously told me that they lived in a two story house). She slightly opened it and tried to jump out but her mom grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away, arms and legs flailing like a cartoon damsel in distress. Finally her dad came in the room and forcefully grabbed Mikayla and flung her over his shoulder and stomped out of the room. Her mother noticed that her computer was on, gave me a horrified look and ended the chat.\n\nIt's been two months and I haven't heard from Mikayla. I cancelled all of Dixie's accounts (and Marina's) and made ones under my real name, followed Mikayla on Twitter, messaged her on Kik and friend requested her on Facebook in hopes of a response but her Twitter hasn't been updated since right before the psychotic rage incident on Skype. I want to apologize to her and tell her my story, that I'm a broken human being and I’m so sorry for causing he so much stress but I don't know what happened to her."},"422":{"title":"That was never my sister","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ubx7x\/that_was_never_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"farttart2","selftext":"I am not writing this is in my basement trying to hide from this so called  \"sister\" before she gets home and sorry for any typos so lets get on with this.

Pffffft. What a load of runny dog shit. **I** didn't vote for him and, in fact, no one I know or have talked to in the past year voted for him either. \n\nWhat happened to our \"voices matter?\"\n\nI can't even begin to wrap my head around this situation. We just elected someone who has *zero* experience in our political system. This guy - this fucking guy - has only been involved in our world for the past two years. **Two years!** That's it! Yet we're all expected to follow suit and just cozy up next to him and give him undying support.\n\nFuck that.\n\nThis election was rigged. I can't prove it, but dammit...I know it was. Like I said, no one I know of voted him in - and I know basically everyone, aside from a few of the people in our foreign territories. Well, I don't know them personally. I watch them. We watch everyone. Just like us in the Headquarters, exactly zero percent of the population was stupid enough to vote for someone who doesn't understand our system.\n\nIt doesn't matter, though. Yesterday, I decided to take a stand against this. \n\nWe have rules. Not guidelines. Not suggestions. Rules. Rules detailing how we are allowed to conduct ourselves, how we can dress, public acts - damn near everything we do is governed by one of the rules. One rule in particular clearly states that we are not allowed to protest in city streets due to the fact that it can disrupt the general population and give us a bad image. We never really break the rules, but I felt like this was the time to make my opinion heard.\n\nI organized a protest through social media under the guise of a fake name. I wanted to get a group to run right through the streets - signs and all - not stopping until the police physically ended it. To my surprise, a couple hundred people clicked \"attending\" within the first hour. It was perfect. I sent out messages to every person and confirmed attendance. Then, I sent out of few telegrams to some people close to me to see if they wanted in on the fun - they did. \n\nWe all met in the park around 7pm to spread out signs, designate paths and escape plans, and determine our rally chants. By 9pm we were ready to mobilize. To my dismay, the group decided that we should all march as one massive unit as opposed to splitting up into smaller groups that could cover more area. That decision was going to make my personal plans a bit more difficult, but not impossible.\n\nWe began marching to the heart of city. I led the pack with two of my closer friends, chanting \"Revoke the Vote\" and keeping our group as loosely organized as possible. We barely made it a block before garnering lots of attention from the general public. Some were yelling obscenities at us. Others began to march with us. \n\nAfter another few blocks, once the group was good and worked up, I handed the syringes to my friends and we fell back to different parts of the crowd. It was hardly a chore to rally my first victim away with the pretense that I knew a way to \"*really* get our message across.\" I took him behind a small little Chinese restaurant on 42nd, and showed him the small handgun I had with me. \n\n\"A few shots in the air, and the media will swarm us, man.\" I said as I handed the gun to him. As he admired it's shoddy craftsmanship I stabbed his neck with the syringe. His crying couldn't be heard over the deafening drone of the \"Revoke the Vote\" chants. \n\nThe process for transformation takes anywhere between thirty seconds and four minutes to start, depending on the person and amount of toxin injected. This guy was a bit on the scrawny side, and before a full minute has elapsed his pores were tearing open and the sludge was forcing its way out. Brown, black, and thick - it had him entirely covered and stuck to the ground before two minutes had passed. Cocoon established. By the fourth minute, the cocoon had hardened and was beginning to crackle as the new creature was preparing to emerge. \n\nIt ripped itself from it's shell to the chorus of it's skin tearing away from the insides like Velcro peeling apart. That's always been my least favorite part, honestly. But there it was - a magnificent specimen. Oily bronzed skin, hairless body, and merged digits - it was divine. Although the creatures always have skin covering their eyes and mouths, I could have sworn this one was smiling at me as if to say \"thank you.\"\n\nIt tilted its featureless head to the sky and began twitching in small, rapid movements...a sign that my friends were also able to subdue their victims.\n\n\"Infect!\" I commanded. Without hesitation, it sprinted out into the streets, catching up to the crowd in mere seconds. I kept to the shadows while I observed the demonstration. \n\nAs it reached the back of the group, it explosively expanded its body into thousands of fibrous tendrils that covered ten or so people in the back of the crowd. The rest of the people began to turn around at the cries for help, but before they could react the other creatures overtook them as well. The lucky few that weren't instantly consumed made an honorable attempt at running away until one-by-one they were disabled by the coughing and subsequent vomiting of the sludge. Within five minutes we now had hundreds of cocoons littering the city streets. Complete infection was imminent...until our \"elected\" official decided to show his face. \n\nHe stood there, taking it all in, and in his eyes I could see the fear settling in. The underestimation of what our organization is capable of. But in a flash of intense red light, it was all gone. The creatures, the cocoons - gone. It was daylight again, and life was moving around me as if nothing had ever happened. Nothing had changed, except the two black marks I gained on each of my palms. I was done. \n\nI have to move to Canada, now. International rules will keep me away from the organization and our new leader's reach. In my ignorance I made assumptions about him based on nothing more than hearsay and frustration. \n\nNow I'm a target.\n\nThe others will surely terminate me if they see me again after my stunt. It's safe there...I hope."},"424":{"title":"The Sleep Experiment","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8jrc24\/the_sleep_experiment\/","flair":null,"author":"kim0419ify","selftext":"It all started on that night. I got a letter in the mail and I walked in my room without Mom seeing it. I knew she would want to see. When I opened it, I immediately grabbed anything I could carry and snuck out the back door. With the address clutched in my hand, my feet carried me swiftly to my destination. After 10 minutes, I got there. When I walked in, I told the woman, “I’m here for the sleep experiment.” She just nodded and pressed a button to open the metal door. I walked in.\n\nWhen I got inside, there was a balding man sitting at his desk. It seemed like he was waiting for me. “Ah, I see you’ve finally made it, Parker.” I just nodded and gave a wry smile. How the hell did this guy know my name? “...-KER...PARKER JONES!!!” The man seemed like he was trying to get my attention. “O-Oh...sorry.” I said in a kind of small voice. The now already frustrated looking man rubbed his temples and, after taking some deep breaths, gave me a smile. “I’m very sorry for ruining your daydream, but we have some important matters to attend to. Please, take a seat while I explain.” He said in a bittersweet tone gesturing to a seat I haven’t realized until now.\nAs I sat down, the man already seemed to be ready to explain whatever he wanted to explain. \"Now, I suppose you're here because of a letter I've sent, correct? Now I am not explaining what I meant...yet. I just want to do a measly, little experiment if that's okay?\" I then nodded, now very curious as to what he wanted me to do. \"Alright! Now, I am a neurologist, a person who studies the brain. I am trying to find a solution as to why people get nightmares from their subconscience, rather than their conscience. And, you seemed like the best person for the job. Oh, and if you want to know how, a close friend of yours told me how frequent your nightmares are.\" Joseph, you bastard! How the hell could you tell someone when I told you not to?! \"Now, I don't want to waste anymore precious time, so let's go to the room where this will be conducted.\" He said before pulling me along to the mayhem that was soon to start.\n\nI...don't remember much before the experiment started. I just remember the sharp pain I felt in several parts of my head. And then I was surrounded by darkness. And then I saw my mom washing the dishes. She was speaking to me, but I really couldn't hear what she was saying. Suddenly, my eyes dragged to a door that appeared suddenly. The shape of a man was there, but it wasn't a man. It's skin was leathery and had some deep cuts on its face. And it had a knife in its left hand. My eyes went wide like a deer in the headlights when I knew what it was going to do. My voice couldn't come out when I wanted it to and my body wouldn't move. Even though it was stalking behind her naturally, like it was meant to do this. Right when it was about to chop her head off, that was when my damn body and voice came back to me, \"MOM!!!!!!!\" I yelled until my voice went hoarse... but that didn't help at all. Her head rolled up to my foot. With that same smile of hers.\n\nAnd then I jumped up panting roughly and sweating. Putting myself, it felt like I had my pajamas on. But... I didn't have my pajamas on when I left for the experiment. And then I remembered about my mother and burst out of my room into the kitchen. To my horror, she was dead like in my dreams. When I ran to her body with tears streaming down my face and harsh sobs coming from my mouth, the letter fell to the floor and showed the message inside. It said, \"Nightmares come from your subconscience and subconscience comes from the fears of life.\""}}
